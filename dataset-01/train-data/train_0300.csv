3,Beetles lightly toasted,"The novel, Beetles lightly Toasted, is one of the worst books I've ever read! The book described, the setting just ok, but did horrible with the characters. With sections like `Andy walked down the hall, a hall covered with, disgusting germs and the people, oh! The people were just as bad. This story was, is and, will always be, the worst book ever!The main Character wasn't very interesting and believable. The author, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor, wasn't doing so well with creating and introducing characters throughout the story. Earl was the worst of them all. Naylor described him as an overweight older brother of Andy.I wouldn't recommend cow-manure so, I certainty wouldn't recommend this book! Yes, yes I know what you are thinking, but, the book is that bad! I hate books that ""make"" you imagine what you already have imagined with a different book (nothing new).If you want to read a terrible novel, be my guest but beware, authors like, Madeline L`engel, Phyllis Reynolds Naylor"
1,Yeuch,"Mike Oldfield has bludgeoned the life out of a lovely piece of music, if you want to hear it, get the original one."
1,TB 2003 remaster utterly pretentious and downright awful,"John Cleese reprising Vivian Stanshall role as master of ceremonies on a Tubular Bells remaster is utterly pretentious and downright awful.Vivian Stanshall might have been drunk when he was the Master of Ceremonies on the original (and best!) version of Tubular Bells, yet his improvisation of the introduction of instruments was pure genius.Mike should have remembered Vivian's genius when he was looking for a voice over for the 2003 version of Tubular Bells.Nb. Vivian Stanshall drunk reference see; Changeling Mike Oldfield's Autobiography."
3,Get the original,"If I had never heard the original, I probably would have liked this more. Just as I hate movie reviews which talk about the book it was based on, I tried to hear this on its own. As such it is OK, but it has no feeling and does not connect with the history of the original.One interesting thing you can do with this since it is broken up into 17 tracks (which is otherwise annoying) is you can play it on randomize and listen to it all out of sequence. Very odd."
2,"Get the original instead. PLEASE, do yourself a favour and get the original instead.","This remake will only sound ""better"" to you if your definition of ""better"" is nothing more than replacing real instruments with hi-tech synthesizers. If you care about the technological aspects of music more than the music itself, you'll probably like this one more. But if you care about emotional resonance, PLEASE, do a favour to mankind and forget this one. Tubular Bells will remain timeless and awe-inspiring, while this remake will date very, very quickly. If you already have the original and want something more, go get ""Incantations"" or ""Amarok"", and only get this one if you worship soul-less exercises in technology like ""The Songs Of Distant Earth""."
4,Aged well with the years,"Think of this 2003 re-recording of the 30 year old Tubular Bells like your spouse of as many years with a new outfit; you'll remember what you love about it all over again.Now how about releasing that live version the Queen Elizabeth Hall in June 1973, with Mick Taylor, Steve Hillage, Fred Frith, Ted Speight, David Bedford, Kevin Ayers and Pierre Moerlen?!"
3,the song remains the same,This poor man keeps releasing the same thing. It makes me wonder if he's really a robot. I am waiting for Tubular Bells 3008!
4,"Excellent re-make, excellent surround mix","With this 2003 re-recording of Tubular Bells, Oldfield stays totally faithful to the original arrangements, not changing anything (except for the use of John Cleese at the end). Listening to this, it's sort of akin to listening to a performer doing a live performance of an old classic when they remain faithful to the original recording but everything sounds better due to newer recording technology, and this, of course is a new studio re-working, not a live performance so it's really immaculate-sounding. As for the 5.1 mix on the DVD-A, it is wonderful: you'll hear this work in an entirely new light. Highly recommended as a fine new companion piece to the original."
3,I Prefer the Original,"I've been a fan of Mike Oldfield's work since the release of ""Tubular Bells"" in the 1970's. Unfortunately, I think this 2003 re-recording lacks much of the spontaneity and exhuberance that made the original recording so wonderful.All the way from the excessively fuzzy sound of the rock guitars to John Clease using his best ""Fawlty Towers"" voice to call out the various instruments in the Part One Finale. This version of ""Tubular Bells"" is just too studied; too aware of itself; too cute; too over-produced.I'm going to continue listening to the original recording - warts and all. It's alive in a way that ""Tubular Bells 2003"" is not."
4,"give the ""get on with your career"" judgments a break","This album sounds good. Do I care if this is the only thing he ever did 5 and 6 times? NO! If you are troubled by that, don't listen to it, but that does not make THIS rendition a bad one. It sounds GREAT, just as powerful, but I guess nothing is more powerful than nostalgia is it? If you like tubular bells, if you wish to hear a different take on the same music of lo those many years ago, then you will LOVE this album. If you are hoping for a comeback of high-heel shoes for men with goldfish in the sole, then better stick with 1973.."
2,The repeating point,"how many times do we hear it? ""tubular bells"",""Tubular bells II"",""Tubular Bells III"",""The millenium bell"",""the best of tubular bells""......Man - it is a good music but it gets boring every time when Mike's rides on his legend making another bells...what next - ""Tubular bells IV"" ???we don't need another bells - for all of you who wants to buy it - get original ""Tubular bells"" - it is much more interesting and less synthetic."
1,"get the Original ""Tubular bells""","the new version shows that Mike has no money and he wants to desperately get our money and interest by making another bells after another.we had ""Tubular bells II"",""Tubular bells III"",""The millenium bell"",""the best of tubular bells"" and now we have this.truly - the original reminds still after 30 years one of his best albums and one of the best albums of instrumental rock.get the Tubular bells"" from 1973,don't even touch this!"
2,What's the point?,"Mike Oldfield reaches back to the past to rehash his ""Bells"" for the n-th time. When Glenn Gould re-recorded the Goldberg Variations, he breathed so much new soul and new ideas into the new version. For Oldfield, the Bells have been such a cash cow that he can't let go of milking it. It speaks for the evolution of modern music that with digital precision the spirit of the music vanishes and all you get is perfect sound, polished like a Britney Spears dancedoll without much individuality or meaningful musical contribution. Had Mike truly revived his Bells with new artistic ideas, it would be different. Even naming them TB 2003 (like Windows 2000) shows the bad taste in this marketing stint. Empty and disappointing."
3,Mike Oldfield & John Cleese,"It's the 4th version of 'Bells' in last 11 years, seems to me that Mike is in the deep idea crisis right now. His manner of playing guitar saves the thing though, it sounds nice.Ah, almost forgot! Hiring John Cleese, Monty Python guy, as a conzertmeister is the most great idea I could even imagine Mike would implement!"
3,Good book but a wrong title,"The book should be called ""Most Popular Models of Long Firearms"", or, since the book is in Spanish ""Selección de rifles y escopetas de los fabricantes más populares"". The lists nicely in alphabetical order most manufacturers of firearms. The descriptions of individual firearms and their makers are very good, accurate, and comprehensive enough for a reader doing a research project or trying to compare models. It skips tens if not hundreds of smaller makers. Also, unnecessarily expands its coverage, fortunately only in a few instances, beyond the subject of hunting firearms by listing some weapons, which are of purely military purposes. The book lacks descent introduction, describing differences between hunting and not hunting firearms, hunting and not hunting ammunition, calibers, and reasoning behind them. Overall good book but more of an album type, rather than encyclopedia."
1,not for SVT,"Not for SVT. Item fits like original, but will not control the idle and caused a very loud ""moose"" sound. Replaced with original Motorcraft part and works like new."
2,Microscopic...,"I picked these out months ago as a suggestion for my fiance. Online they look gorgeous, and maybe if I got a microscope they'd look as pretty in person. I had to put them in my second hole because they looked ridiculous in the first. My fiance's incredibly disappointed because they are non-returnable. For this price I didn't think they would be huge, but I thought they might be at least visibly discernable with the naked eye."
3,"pretty, but tiny","Like the title says, very pretty, but it's tiny. I expected little diamonds, but the whole thing is MAYBE a quarter inch long. Adequate only for a child's ears. I'll have to go elsewhere for my wife's valentine's day present. :("
1,Picture here taken under a microscope!,"OMG ... they are extremely tiny - Do not go by the picture . It is a 5-6x magnified version of whats in the box.Pretty for a 3-4 year old!If you are looking forward to seeing the 4 diamonds and the sapphire on your own ""adult"" ears even in a mirror - forget it - Not VISIBLE!"
5,a memoir of an angel,"This book was an exceptional easy read from start to finish; mostly because you can't put it down. The real struggle is having enough tissue handy to dry your eyes. The author puts his heart on his sleeve by opening his floodgates to his grief over the loss of his son, and the amazing discovery of his sons' everlasting presence. This book relates to anyone who has rode the emotional rollar coaster of infertility, loss of a child, and the surprising joy of adoption. This is a truly touching book that has opened not only my eyes, but my heart. A wonderfully written personal journey of love."
5,Touching Hearts,"This was spirit gripping read that you could not put down. So full of love and emotion, I had to stop between chapters to cry! With such hope for a child and then faced with the ultimate challenge of their lives, this couple so gracefully executed Mason's introduction and quick departure with a deep sense of sharing his short legacy. This can't be compared! You get to know this wonderful family so intimately through this book and it is so healing for those who have been down this road. This book is truly a gift for many and will touch many hearts! Mason is truly an evangelist and he only had 5 days to execute...and he did!"
4,One of barjavel's best novel,"I have read this book in french and in english and it is a piece of art for sure. Barjavel should be as known as any other writter, because he is a poet. The story of the Immortals is divided into three parts : first the true love of the heroes, then the quest and at the end the explaination of all the mistery. You would then understand the death of JFK, and why does Elisabeth II always carry a bag with her."
2,What a pity !,"The first two parts are very good, love, true love, a quest for love, true love; then she finds her husband. And then, it is a story of selection, elitism, superior people who won the eternal life. Hears as fascist to me... Well, it's no news, Barjavel often showed such ideas, but what a pity ! He knew how to make suspense so well !"
4,Works but is thin.,Great product. Works like a mouse pad and works well. But be aware this is about as thick as a typical manila folder. It is designed this way so that you can lay it on your laptop keyboard and close the lid. I think it is a great idea and love mine. Only a word of warning to those of you that are looking to use this on something other than a hard surface.
3,NADA,the book is basically about a girl who goes to study to barcelona in the house of one her aunts. There she only finds bad and nasty things; big fights occur very often between her relatives. The only positivity which takes place is that she finds a beautiful girl which becomes to be her best friend. That girl will save her life.
3,Almost great,"Well the massage oil has a great flavor and an awesome scent. It lubes up very well and it requires only a small amount to massage the entire body. My only issue with it that keeps it from getting a higher rating is that it leaves a sticky feeling once it begins to dry. It doesn't stay smooth like most higher costing oils. ""Get what you oay for."" Right. Other than that the product would be great, but that sticky feeling can often kill the mood."
2,Too sticky but smells good,"These flavors smell and taste good, but it's extremely sticky on the skin. I wouldn't recommend this product. You want a massage oil that is smooth and can remain on the skin for a period of time."
3,It's not CAKE.,"I bought this CD with an open mind, looking for something that if not CAKE, was at least as fresh as CAKE.The CD isn't bad--it's better than average ""alternative"". But overall, it floats at surface level with a lot of other contemporary ""alternative"" stuff. Essentially, you'd have a hard time identifying the sound. In contrast, CAKE is absolutely brilliant, a sound so original that it's in the league of the Talking Heads and DEVO.Please, guys. More CAKE. Less Deathray."
4,Gets you started!,"This book was our text in a Dreamweaver and Fireworks class I took. It offers a good introduction with hands-on experience. You can download files from the internet to do the exercises. The directions are quite clear and easy to follow. I found the dimensions a bit annoying - too wide to set by the computer on a small desk, but the content served it's purpose. Nice layouts too. Lots of eye candy!"
4,Timex Women's Watch,"Nice watch, and the frame is a little bigger than the older version. The picture also makes it look a little more purple or lavender than it actually is. But all in all a very nice watch and in perfect condition."
5,Timex Women's T5E971 Ironman Traditional 30-Lap Black/Silver-Tone...,"This watch is just like my last one and it is the perfect watch for me. It has the functions I need - Lap splits, chronograph, timer, alarm. The silver trim looks good and I think it makes the face more visible."
2,Misleading title,"I bought this book on the title alone - big mistake. Expecting to find more detailed information on the Royal Irish Constabulary Reserve Force (The black and tans), I was sorely disappointed. The book takes a quick, general and superficial look at the Irish ""war"" of independance, albeit with a somewhat pro-British bias. The activities and men of the black and tans is not covered in more detail than in other general accounts of this conflict."
1,WARNING! NOT THE REAL BAND!,"I was very disappointed to know that there is another band out there which is ""ripping-off"" the original band's name. There is not one person here from the original band. In fact this is a totally different group! This is not the same ""the Unsane"" as the one which put out ""Inverted Crosses"" in 1987 or ""Slap Of Reality."""
2,Shame on Amazon!,"This so-called remastered DVD version of ""The Next Man"" is not a technical improvement on the original VHS version. In addition to highly distorted sound and fuzzy picture quality, the film was poorly edited.The tech info provided by Amazon is skimpy and misleading at best, and deceptive at worst. This a better-than-average movie warrants a higher quality transfer and Amazon customers deserve more reliable and detailed product information.Shame on Amazon!"
2,Sad to see this version,"It's a pitty, I have been searching for a DVD version of this movie for so long.And when I finally find it, I discover it is a copy of a bad VHS version, with a picture and soundquality that it's a shame to put on the market on a DVD.I allready have an VHS copy at home, that is faremore better than this DVD.I can off course bear the loss of the money, but with the sincere hope, that thismovie some time in the future could be released in a propher quality version on DVD, andthis time for real!From a propher master and with subtitle.This film is worth it!!!"
1,Poor Visual Quality,The special features on the back of the case state that this DVD is English 2.0 dolby and digitally remastered. The quality looked so bad I didn't have the patience to even view the video DVD. This in NO WAY represents the movie itself. I have great respect for Sean Connery movies however there's been a mistake in the visual quality for this DVD.
3,"ok quality, stone looks cheap though",got it returned because the stones are much much lighter than shown on the picture here. They looks just like glass peices.
5,Pretty,Pretty ring! But it's lighter than it looks in the picture... psh. But it's good quality for the price!
3,Disappointed by stone coloring,"I really looked forward to this product, because I love blue topaz. I was very happy with the quality of the silver. However, the stones were MUCH lighter than the picture showed. So much so that I would label the photo shown as false advertising. Others had found the same, but I thought perhaps the color would be more toward aquamarine. It's not; it's toward the white. I also know that deep blue topaz or London blue is not that expensive to make. I'm keeping it, because it is pretty, but I'm disappointed with the stone color and, judging from other reviews, I know a replacement will be no better."
4,Nice little ring,"This just arrived and I really like it. The color is a bit more pale than shown in the image so I can only give this 4 stars, but the sterling shank is very substantial and the mounting is well done. I snagged this little beauty for 10 bucks, and will be watching for the amethyst version to take a quick price drop as well so I can have both. Wish I had purchased several of this one, but the negative comments of other reviewers persuaded me to just get one. Price is back up to 20 today, so I will keep an eye out for another sale."
5,A lot of compliments,"I bought this not really expecting too much, just that it was pretty. Since I have worn it, I get a lot of compliments on the color how beautiful it is. The ring sits very nicely upon your finger. If gives my hand a very smooth look. I beleive I got a good deal for the price."
4,Easily Blends with No Residue,The only issue is that it doesn't moisturize and ends up feeling dry to the touch. Too bad it's not one of those anti-aging foundations.
5,EXCELLENT CD!!,"Excellent CD!! If you know or are into HAGFISH, then you will definately love this CD. If you don't know HAGFISH you should check them out too they are awesome. You will love this CD if you like fast paced pop punk sounding music. It is great from start to finish not one bad song. This is definately one of my fav. CD's!! Pick it up TODAY!!"
2,Hard to Recommend,"This is a strange book. Actually, it's two books in one, with a dopey chapter for children thrown in for good measure. The first half is about nuclear power, both in energy production and weapons. The second half is an editorial for nuclear disarmament. The authors make no attempt to divorce their politics from the discussion. Even the first, more substantive half of the book is liberally laced with disarmament talking points.Notwithstanding their views on disarmament, the authors support nuclear power and do a pretty good job explaining the scientific, financial and engineering aspects of the Peaceful Atom. If the portions on nuclear power were available separately as a pamphlet I would strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the subject. On balance, however, those few chapters don't justify wading through the entire book."
2,A difficult read,"I have read many individual conversion stories to Judaism. The majority are remarkable and beautiful as they highlight the personal transformation of an individual's path to conversion. That said, I found this book to be very tedious. The textual analysis did not flow well and it did not keep my attention."
4,Margaritaville her I come,This is good for multiple rim salts and sugars for different types fo drinks and easy to clean. Good value for the price
3,Mediocre,La partitura presenta notevoli errori di scrittura musicale (mancano le alterazioni in chiave per gli strumenti in Sib) e mancanze di impaginazione. Sarebbe altresì utile una traduzione in inglese delle parti cantate.
1,May damage your PSP! Avoid!,"My husband got this for his brand new PSP. I wish we had done more research first. To install this analog stick, you have to remove the original one. Although my husband was very, very careful, the original analog stick broke in the process. To add insult to injury, the replacement rubbery analog stick doesn't even work well! It rubs against the faceplate of the PSP instead of moving smoothly. We are now waiting for a replacement OEM analog stick. Hopefully the internal mechanism isn't damaged. If it is, we will have to void the warranty to fix it ourselves or send it in for repairs. Buyer beware!"
1,Psp 1000 only,"ok first of all I got one like this at gamestop and it said for all psps 1000, 2000, 3000. And I thought it was great,it comes with 5 parts and the one for the 3000 was ony a cover for the analog stick. The one for the 1000 was a real analog stick, So I wasted $5. Don't ever get this if you have a 3000 or 2000 psp. For a psp 1000 it would work fine,so I guess it depends on which psp model you have..........."
3,I needed the stick for my first gen psp,The only thing is I had to get my analog stick section fixed on my psp and was told these are the issue even though i had them on my psp for 2+ yrs. It's only way to replace the stick on your psp 1001
1,BEWARE -- can damage your PSP.,"These have caused me to have to replace the analog mechanism inside my PSP twice until I wised up -- there is something about using them, if you are the kind of player who presses kinda heavy on his sticks, (I do it unintentionally) you WILL screw the internal mechanism up and need to either replace the internal mechanism yourself or send it in somewhere for service.."
2,"Nice cheap addon, but changes the profile of the device.","I don't really like the analog ""nub"" on the PSP and avoid games that make me use it. These little replacement snap-on joystick covers mitigate that flaw -- they're easy to grab, stick up, and increase the ""throw"" of the joystick.Unfortunately, they also stick way up into the air, making it impossible to use a normal PSP carrying case such as the wonderful Logitech PlayGear Pocket case, or even the propylene sleeve that comes with the unit.As much as I want to like these things, they're just too impractical for my *portable* unit."
1,"Yes, it's correct, this should be RECALLED - DO NOT BUY.","I usually don't write reviews but am so thankful for the input from others on this, and having had my analog core destroyed by using this product, wanted to help warn others. The physics of the over-size and taller stick, as stated by others, does wear down your analog core somehow. It took only 3-4 weeks on mine with very limited play, maybe 4-5 hours at most.DO NOT BUY at any cost, it is not worth it. I returned mine and spend the money on buying a new analog core/button on ebay. I intend to contact the manufacturer to recommend a recall."
2,AVOID THESE!!!,"Like one of the other guys said, these things will end up totally screwing up your analog core. Because the center of gravity is higher than the regular nubs, it ends up putting pressure on the wrong areas and your analog will eventually quit responding like you want it to. The best bet is to get a replacement nub that is similiar in size to the original, but has added grip. There are sites on the internet that have these. DO NOT BUY THESE."
1,Dash - it fell apart,"My son received this figure for his birthday - it broke within the first 5 minutes. The sign on his chest lights up, which is cool - but now he has no legs, so he certainly can't run!"
5,Neat!,Thanks for your promptness. It arrived on time and was just what our grandgirl wanted for her birthday. You made her very happy.
2,Too flimsy to enjoy,"This was lots of fun for my son who is very careful with his toys. I'm not sure if it was my husband or my son who actually did it, but within the first few days of having it, the legs broke off. My son really is very careful and so is my husband, so I know it's a flaw in the actual action figure."
5,Beautiful Earrings!,"Just received these pretty earrings. They seem to be very nice. Since I am giving them as a gift, I cannot speak to the quality but there's no reason to believe they are anything less than perfect. Thanks!"
1,"Wagner, Pompous As Ever","This was a turgid book if ever there was one. I couldn't finish it. In his own words, Richard Wagner comes across as pompous,arrogant, self-centered, not very bright and boring to death. He may have been a musical genius, depending on whom one consults, but I certainly had no use for, and could not spend much time with the unpleasant person in this book. Maybe someone else's biography of him might be a bit more interesting and enlightening, but he should have kept his hands off trying to write his own."
5,Great! A must have!!!,This cd is awesome. If you are an addict of the show this cd is a must have. It includes the best songs from each of the top 10 finalists! My personal favorite is Justin's songs!! It mixes all the genres of music that were sung during the show. This cd is the best!!
5,KELLY CLARKSON RULES!!!!!,"I love Kelly Clarkson!! Every song she has sang so far has been awesome, she never stops!! And now she has a new Album out everywhere in stores now called Greatest Moments. I LOVE IT!!! I listen to it probably 5 times a week!!"
2,Badly Put Together,"I loved American Idol, I watched every minute of the series and saw some wonderful performances. Sadly, the producers of the album opted to have the performers record their songs in a studio. The result, the songs lost the emotion they had as you watched on TV. Tamyra's performance of ""A House Is Not A Home"" had me in tears at home when she did it on the show. On the CD it lacks the emotion. Kelly's performances have some of the emotion she showed on TV, but they also fail to live up to what was shown on TV.Another mistake was the fact that the singers all sound like their vocals are very strained. That does not make for good music.If you loved the show, this will be a good walk down memory lane. If you didn't adore the show, skip this one."
3,Idol memories,"Enjoyed the cd, remembering highlights of the show I enjoyed, however after listening to it three times, I,m already bored."
4,hey!,Like everyone here I am a fan of the show. It's an album to have if you are. I wish there were more songs though.Kelly-What can I say she's awesome. Both of her songs paved the way for her.Justin-Thought it was okay. Didn't do anything for me.Nikki-She surprised me. She's pretty good here.Tamyra-She does it so well doesn't she.RJ-Good voice. Kinda boring for me.Christina-Beautiful performace. She got the emotion right for the song.Ryan-I love this girl. Thought the version on the live show was better.AJ-Another one that didn't do anything for me.Ejay-Didn't like the arangement on the song.Jim-Better than on the live show.California dreaming- They sing pretty well together.
4,A Cure For american Idol Withdrawls,"Sad because american Idol is over? don't be too depressed, cuz this album rocks! Kelly sounds great on her four songs, but its nice to hear my personal favorite, Justin Guarini, again!"
1,"Pathetic excuse for what America calls ""music""","Okay, let me start off by saying this album does not even deserve the one star I gave it! This has got to be one of the absolute worst albums to ever go on sale. All it took was one episode,and I was completely nauseated. These are people trying to pass themselves off as artists,though they really don't understand the word art.These are people putting out pathetically cheesy albums,making money off other people who are completly, totally ignorant to what music really is,maybe even because they never really listen to real music. These are not people with raw talent. A dying whale could sing better than half the people on the show.Once again a utterly stupid manufactured pop song, that was was sung by another Mariah Carey wannabe with a ""pretty"" face will sell over raw talent.If you want to hear music by a beautiful woman who actually has talent,buy one of Courtney Love's albums. I mean really, is this what America calls ""Music""?"
4,American Idol fans beware...,"Been a fan of the show pretty much throughout and picked this up today. The song listings here were wrong, so that was kinda disappointing.You have 1 song by everyone, except for Justin, who gets 2 and Kelly who gets 2 + her two songs from the single and California Dreaming, sung by all.The songs are in full version. They sound good, mostly. I just wish we'd had a little more of the other singers, like Nikki and Tamyra, instead of getting the two songs most of us already have on Kelly's single (who's buying this one who hasn't already gotten the single?:)...Other than that, no complaints. I just wanted more songs!"
3,Thumbs up...but,"I have no idea why they gave Kelly Clarson 4 songs on this cd, yet the remaining top ten (other then Justin Guarini) only one song each. Kelly's single/s were just released, and she will also have her own CD in January of 2003. Why include her new singles on this compilation cd as well? That's my major complaint. If your buying this cd to hear anyone other then Kelly you may be disapointed. Fans of third place Nikki, and forth place Tamyra will sadly only be able to listen to one song.They could have easily left off the two extra Kelly songs, and gave the top 5 artists two songs each and still fit everything on the cd.Then comes the question..if you only like one or two of the artists on this disc, are you willing to buy the whole CD for one (or two)songs? I'll let you decide."
2,American Idol?,"I don't think this is helpful. We used to live in a world that worked and I don't think it was because it was a commercial from start to fini. Now days, it seems to be a non-stop commercial and it definitely doesn't work. I think Simon, particularly, is a very bad joke. I remain truly amazed that living and breathing people, mostly young, are able to take this program seriously."
4,"Great, but more, please!","What's here is a phenomenal product for American Idol fans. They've really done a good job of picking some of the best sonic moments from the program. However, they could have easily added some more great songs by making this a 2-disc set. I would have liked to see more of the group songs featured and some more songs from each contestant."
1,buy Kelly's album instead of this,"I never got through listening to this whole album... I bought it because I was a fan of Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini - but just hearing the first few minutes of Kelly's version of Respect, I lost interest. I don't recall ever putting the cd in the cd player after that time. So if you like Kelly and Justin, buy their albums instead."
1,Truly [bad],Just how this silly dreck has managed to beguile millions is one of the mysteries of our time. A small contribution to the decline and fall of western civilization.
1,this cd should have never been made,are you kidding me?in 2 weeks you will not remembertheese people or there bad music.
3,same songs,same songs from the show its ok but i dont like it but hey go buy it is ok to listen to after a bit
5,This is a HIGHSIERRABASSPLAYER MUST HAVE!!!,"If you are going to play serious bass you HAVE to practice your scales, period. This book is an absolute perfect tutor for EVERY scale and EVERY key, and, it includes not only all the major, minor, and church scales, but, everyone's fave pentatonics (majors and minors), jazz melodics, whole tones,and the all the variant blues scales. The book is in a narrow, incredibly sturdy spiral bound hard laminate that fits perfectly on your music stand. Any reviewer that doesn't give this a five-star must lip-sink or play air guitar. This is the book, bar none, for in-the-trenches practicing at my studio. Its taught me so much that I cannot express the value after all those hours. We need one for chord progressions, too! This is a must buy! Keep on practicing and jammin'!"
2,Useless book......,"This book is quite useless!!! It cover about 15 scale forms but it tell me nothing about when to use the scale forms! Save your money and buy other scale form related books! Moreover, it cover these scales with all notes... I think it is a BIG WASTE OF PAPER!!!!! Do you think it is needed? If you're a bassist, the answer is so clear."
4,Beware with peanut allergies.,I have heard very good things about this soap and wanted to try it for my 4 year old's eczema. Until I noticed it contained peanut oil and she has a severe peanut allergy. Just a friendly reminder to always check the ingredients if you or a family member has allergies.
5,Lily Hippo is Too Loud,"This is a sweet, lovely story about finding your place. Read is many a nights to my daughter, who is also a too loud Lily."
2,It won't stick,"It matches my car but the problem was, it won't stick to my car. I followed the instructions as indicated but it just won't stick. Overall it served the purposed on to my car."
2,is this a d20 compatible product?,"I would like to purchase this product but it doesnt have the d20 logo.This product says it is compatible with the 3.5 edition ,but the 3.5 edition of which gaming system is not mentioned---caveat emptor."
5,Great combination of fantasy and romance,"Kyra's family disowned her when she decided to become a magician. She comes back only because she must -- because she has a foreboding that her sister will die on her wedding night.Working magic in secret, Kyra tries to postpone the wedding long enough to solve the mystery. Yet something completely unexpected happens -- she finds herself drawn to her sister's fiance, Spens! (Though at first glance he seems like a stout merchant with bad fashion sense, Spens is a great character.)My biggest problem with this book is the structure of the plot. Important information about the past is withheld, and when the reader learns that information, we pretty much figure out who did it. But I enjoyed this book so much that I didn't mind.I've heard Barbara Hambly's other fantasy books are even better. Now, I can't wait to read them.I gave this book Desert Isle Keeper status at All About Romance."
2,Loved The Windrose Chronicles - did not like molestation,I did love the Windrose books and looked forward to this book that takes a minor character from those stories and forms a stand-alone story (although in the world of The Windrose books). Most of the book was pretty good although I also felt the wedding details droned on a bit. But I was taken aback by the child molestation and that is why I gave it the stars I did. That part made me sick to my stomach.
3,Build quality a little suspect,"Basically a peeler with an Analon handle.Works nice and feels good in the hand, but the peeler itself gets locked in the handle so it does not swivel properly.Maybe we just got a bad one. Prolly should have tried a new one, but never got around to sending it back within the 30 day period. Now it is relegated to back up duty"
4,Pendulum Tome,"This collection is pretty cool to have if you didnt get all the comics individually. With this you get all the pendulums in one book and you get all the songs on one cd. The only problem is that they left off the 3 Tunes for the Juggalos cd and added in a pretty stupid intro instead. But all in all, if you love ICP as much as I do and if you didnt get all the comics when they first came out, then this is for you. Plus, it has all the cover art before each volume wtih out all the extra [stuff] that is on the actual individual comics. So get this if you dont have theses songs yet. P.S. Most of the songs on the cd are available elsewhere so if you dont want the comics, then you dont really need this."
1,"said they had, never received","this was the one gift my son really wanted for his birthday. I was told they had it, I ordered it, and they i'm told they really don't have it and it was too late for me to order from someone else for him to receive it for his birthday. They did credit my card in a timely fashion though."
5,Best Sparkplug you can get for your snow blower!,"What a great spark plug, even in the deepest snow, it still manages to spark consistently. There was 3 feet of snow on the grownd, and it's like this plug didn't even know it! It just sparked and sparked! A true inspiration!"
3,Theodicy,"This is a compelling book that addresses the age old question of ""Why, God?"" This book is a useful resource for any study of theodicy. It probes the reasons and answers to the question of why God allows certain things to occur. Good resource!"
4,An old high school fave,"I read this book in high school and it was an old favorite. This was my second purchase with my Kindle Paperwhite and i wanted it to be something that I knew and loved. It is an old-fashioned love story but there is so much goodness in this story, there are still things we can learn from the past. To me, a good book like this is like coming home and this story is just that."
2,I didn't get far with this one,"I didn't get very far reading this book. I didn't read about Kathleen's relationship with Donnigan because I was throughly disgusted with her character by Chapter 3. Kathleen is so timid it's revolting. She does the housework for her stepmother ""Madame"" for years, including bringing her breakfast on a tray. Never mind the fact that ""Madame"" has got two good legs and Kathleen limps. Never think about that, Katie, me darlin'! Never speak up for yourself! Just do like ""Madame"" says. Maybe she gets better as the book goes along, but I didn't really care. I'd have liked to see ""Madame"" get hers a little ways down the road. I guess if you've got that attitude, however, then Christian fiction is not for you."
2,As much fluff as a bag of cotton balls,"If you're looking for a quality read, don't pick up Oke. On the positive side, there are no curse words or lurid sex scenes. If this is your only standard for a good read, you're in luck. The characters are cardboard cutouts, the dialogue is stilted, and the plot unrealistic. The moral is not hinted at subtly, but thrown into the reader's face."
4,"Thought-provoking, enjoyable, witty.....","This is my sixth Janette Oke book to read. This book, hands down,is the best Oke book thus far. Characterization is developed to the point that you can feel the nervousness both of the main characters (Donnigan and Kathleen) experience as they made the decision to sign up and follow through with the idea of the mail order bride. You can feel the anxiety Kathleen experienced with the haystack fire and also with the loss of Taryn. Donnigan's search for God's plan of salvation was thought-provoking as we take the presence of churches / Bibles / pastors as a way of life. Interspersed throughout the book were bits of humor and wit. ""A Bride for Donnigan"" is an all round great book."
4,Marriage Isn't Easy,"I liked it because both main characters were well developed and the plot was unusual about man out west and two of his friends ordering brides from overseas. Three women were matched up with the three men, sight unseen. When the women arrived, they married right away. It was a fun and interesting read, which revealed the adjustments that were involved in making the marriages work. One did not. Donnigan felt a strong responsibility to teach his children and prepare them for life after death, but had to search the scriptures himself to find out about God and how to get to heaven because there was no church near by. It was a very enjoyable read!"
3,Not bad,This book started out very good. The last few chapters were terrible. They never gave Donnigan's age but they gave Kathleen's age. I found it odd the Donnigan could sleep with Kathleen but he felt that she was a child? Book had patenshal. Kathleen's part got on my nervouses.
1,Don't Bother,"That's about all I'll say- just don't bother. It'd be a waste for this to sit on your shelf. It's kind of like a trashy beach romance novel without the trashy part. So, to reiterate an earlier review, if that's your only criteria, you'll love it."
1,Light Fluff with Almost no Redeeming Qualities,"I was disappointed with this book from Janette Oke. Her lack-luster writing style makes me wonder if perhaps she just scribbled this off on the weekend to meet a deadline, which is really too bad because the plot idea is excellent, but it could have been done oh, so much better! Her characters were flat, and the way she jumped over long periods of time, I thought perhaps my book was missing pages. It wasn't. If anyone is looking for a Christian romance that has depth and endearing, Christian characters, I strongly recommend Lori Wick- especially her book 'The Princess'. Maybe next time, Ms. Oke."
5,A Great Book on a Dry Topic,"A great presentation of what I expected to be an unexciting topic. Examines the workings of the political system in a highly readable way. I was not only well-informed after I read the book, but entertained as well!"
1,POOR QUALITY EMERALD EARRINGS,"I ordered these earrings for my wife for Christmas. The emeralds are very, very, poor quality, don't even look like emeralds, they are milky white, nothing like the ones represented on their web site. I contacted Fred Meyer Jewerly, explained the problem, I can return them, but I have to pay the return shipping and insurance. I feel that since the stones were so badly miss represented, that they should pay the return, but they refuse. I will never order from thenm again."
4,Excellent Study Aid,"This book was a great deal of help for me and a few of my classmates during our EMT-B class. We would get together and go over the case studies that were in the book, as well as going over the test questions. We all scored well on out state boards and are now all practicing EMT-B's on a volunteer rescue squad."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK,"I am the author of this book. Whenever you are buying an EMS book, be sure that it is the newest edition. This book is OUT OF DATE."
4,This is how it's done,"Ms. Atwood is a North American and she doesn't try to pretend otherwise. But with attention to detail and respect for the Brazilian material, she creates a beautiful Pan-American fusion. Like when the Brazilian masters take on the Great American Songbook, only in reverse. Last week I saw a performance by someone in Ms. Atwood's peer group (but with a higher industry profile) and the three Brazilian numbers she attempted made me wish it was Eden up on the stand."
2,Over the Top,"Quite a band has been assembled to back Eden Atwood on this recording: Bill Cunliffe on piano, Derek Oles on bass, Joe LaBarbera on drums, Anthony Wilson on guitar, Scott Breadman on percussion, and--most exciting of all--Pete Christlieb on tenor sax and flute. Sadly enough, all is pretty well for naught, subverted by the singer. This kind of music should have subtlety, but Atwood takes everything over the top. What a shame, especially in light of the excellent sound quality."
5,2 different versions of the same title,"be careful!! I ordered this book and received the book with only two stories. ""The Peace War"" and ""Marooned in Realtime"". ""The Ungoverned"" could be missing!!! Check the index."
5,most satisfying,"Vinge delivers facinating hard SF with truely adept storytelling. The science fiction is almost as good as science fact, and the storytelling is among the elite for highly readable authors. Cross Gribbin with Tolkien and you get Vinge."
3,It Ain't Dune!!!,"The book (and stories within) is an average - maybe slightly above average- SF novel. To suggest it's in a class with Dune (or Vinge's two newer novels - which ARE in a class with Dune), is shocking to me.Buy it if you're looking for a pleasant, but not breathtaking read. And if you haven't read A Fire Upon The Deep and then A Darkness In The Sky - what are you waiting for!!!"
3,A very uneven writer,"This book is actually two novels:""The Peace War"" and ""Marooned in Realtime"".""The Peace War"" is very well written and places Vernor Vinge with the old time sci fi great writers.""Marooned in Realtime"" is a very bad mystery and with a very bad plot.The result is a five star mixed with a one star for the whole book. It is worth buying for ""The Peace War""."
1,"HORRID BOOK, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.","As an author myself, it is incomprehensible that a reputable and high quality publisher would accept a text of such mindless drivel as this horrid book. The author is obviously completely uneducated on the subject upon which he writes, and is grossly incompetent as a writer in general. Krassen rambles on and on insignificant matters when there are so many important topics he could be discussing, but instead he wastes the readers time expounding on his ridiculous and unfounded opinions. If it were possible, I would rate this book as 0 stars, as one star is too high. Don't waste your money on this book."
5,I absolutely loved it,"This book is great. One of my all-time favorites; I recently found out it is also a favorite of professional psychics. If you like stories of witchcraft and royalty, this book is for you!"
3,Wacky Historical Fun,"17th-century Paris is the setting for this tale of a 16-year-old girl who becomes the protege of the leading female occultist of the time. In an incredibly Byzantine plot, the girl is transformed and rises to a position of great influence in the wackiness surrounding the court of the Sun King. There's all kind of sensational stuff, poison, black masses, abortionists, and the usual stalwarts love and revenge. At times it gets a little overwrought, but it's fairly good fun nonetheless. If one were to be totally honest, probably more likely to appeal to female readers."
2,not impressed....,"While the characters in this tome are compelling, I found the prose to be lacking in the depth and maturity necessary to sustain a story with as many facets as this one has. The result is a story line that feels illogical, chaotic and predictable."
5,"Very clever, and entertaining","First I will tell of the two faults I have with the book. 1) the first chapter feels out of place, and it is hard to get into the right mood after it. 2) the charecters don't feel as if they have been described enough when they were introduced. With the exception of the two or three main characters. However I fell in love with the book when I bought it (on a whim for 3$ at a bargin book store). I have read it twice and am working on it for the third time. It is amazing! Everyone should read it!"
3,Different from earlier work,"After reading the author's earlier work this book was a surprise. Van Der Ryn's earlier work theorizes eco-design and its importance. This book is more a nice coffee-table history of his life's work and his encounters. There were a few new insights that were useful academically.. It is a nice introduction, perhaps a gift for someone you might want to introduce to eco-design."
1,Incompetent Author,"The section on the Herschel wedge or solar prism immediately informed me that the author was totally misinformed about it's use and level of safety. He obviously has never read the correct instructions for using one, much less actually used one as he does not even mention use of the ND3 filter that is always used with such a device. I find this inexcuseable in an author writing a book about solar observation.His ""not safe"" conclusion is correct if anyone tried to follow his use instructions as they are totally wrong. A very good English language manual on how to safely use a Herschel wedge or solar prism is available from the Baader Planetarium web site in Germany as a PDF file."
5,Freestyle diva from the bay,"Well this cd I baught when it first came out and combined old skool Freestyle with new, and is absolutely one of the best Freestyle cds ever released . It is definitly on my top 10,I love the songs ""No one"" and the remix ,also ""Give me a reason""and the tribute song to the late Selena.This cd is amust for Freestyle fans! I know Buffy has probably stayed home taking care of her child,from what I heard and hopefully she will come out with a long waited Freestyle cd, like other Freestyle artists did when they had children ,like Cynthia and many other artists."
5,the cd is hellatight and is one of the best freestyle cds.,The cd is tight and is the best. Her cd can get to your heart and soul if you really listen to it. The CD has been around for a very long time and still is thats shows how good the cd is. She need to get reconized for her talents and this cd shows it. All the tracks on there is tha ssssshhhhhh. She needs to get her props for her talents.
5,Album is a perfect 10!,"Freestyle music has seen its ups and downs in the last decade and although its not as popular as it was back in the late 80s, it is still definately a strong genre. With artists like Buffy and M:G turning out the hits, it seemed like the genre was making a comeback. Unfortunately Buffy has left her label and is taking a break from music... I truly hope she comes back because her voice, her lyrics, beats, EVERYTHING are simply incredible!! Whether you like ballads or dance beats, this album will NOT disappoint!"
2,not as I expected,"Some songs are ok. Like, ""Give Me A Reason"". Why are all the songs, high pitched (hurting my ears)and they basically have the same beats. People want to hear different variations of songs, not similar songs. I prefer Jocelyn Enriquez's songs."
1,"""Teach them the hard truth while they are young""","This book is considered a classic, but after reading it as an adult I can see the real message behind the story. Goldie Locks strolls trough the woods and comes across your the bear house. She then proceeds to break into your home, use your stuff, eat your food, and pass out in your bed. Then, when the bears come home and catch her asleep, mother bear (who looks like Mammie from ""Gone With The Wind"") tells her she can come back any time she feels like it. In a nutshell this is a children's version of actual events involving Nordic European settlers who roll in and claim everything as theirs. The only thing missing from this story is rape and smallpox. Aside from the historical resemblence, do you really want your children to think it's ok to roam into your neighbors house while they are out? If so, I would hate to be on the recieving end of a phone call from your neighbor or the police."
4,"Original story, well written, with beautiful illustrations.","This is the original story, well told. I rate it at 4, versus 5, stars, though, because of the illustrations. Although absolutely beautiful, from an artistic point of view, they are a little complicated, from a child's point of view. For instance, there is an illustration of Goldilocks sitting on Papa Bear's chair, but no illustration of Mama Bear's chair or Goldilocks trying it out. Same for the beds. The main illustrations are framed with smaller illustrations which seem to be referencing all that Goldilocks does, but I bought this book for my two year old (who LOVES it), and I think it would be clearer for him if it had more explicit illustrations."
2,Skip this one,"I love Jan Brett's books, but this is not one of my favorites. The wording is tedious to read, and I found myself skipping sentences to avoid it. The illustrations are beautiful, but even my husband agrees...it's just not one of her better books."
1,Bummer Version,"I was not impressed with this version of Goldilocks, while the illustrations were beautiful, the added repetitive wording got very tiresome. I was reading this to my 6 month old, and I don't mind that they didn't call them ""Papa, Mama and Baby"" but repeating ""great, huge, big, giant, large, huge bear"" every other sentence was exhausting to read and quite boring, did not keep her attention or mine at all."
2,Beautiful illustrations but too politically correct,"The illustrations in the book are gorgeous. However, they are possibly too complex for young readers. Still, the illustrations are beautiful. I really object to the descriptions of the three bears. Papa bear has become a ""great, huge bear"" and mama bear the ""middle-sized bear"" while baby bear is now a ""little, small, wee bear"". Ridiculous! The story has gone from a family of bears, whose home is invaded by a (beautifully drawn) little girl, to an unrelated collection of bears of varying sizes that make the story clunky to read, for no obvious benefit to the story or anything else besides some distorted sense of political correctness. I've returned the book, and suggest that you look elsewhere for the classic story."
5,A wonderful read. I will look for more from Jean Thompson.,"This is the story of a teenage girl who seemeingly has nothing on her horizon but trouble. Her uncle believes that he is the Weather Channel's ""Local Forecast"". Unknown to them both is that a raging loner from Los Angeles is heading toward their hometown of Springfield.This is a beautifully written, dark and suspenseful novel. Thompson's writing is crisp, realistic, and she does an excellent job of capturing on paper what life is like in the heartland. I highly recommend this novel. I, for one, will be looking for more from Jean Thompson."
3,Too long and not really believable,"I liked these characters -- Josie, Elaine and Harvey --a lot at first. They were quirky enough to be interesting and I liked the way Thompson worked the plot around them. Then she brought in Rolando, a crazy mixed up Hispanic. I knew something bad was going to happen and I didn't like it. I think Thompson wanted to write about the first three people and their lives, but couldn't figure out how to make the novel stay entertaining and come out right. She set these three characters in motion, then realized she didn't have a clue as to what would happen in the end, so she added a ""bad guy"" for excitement and a big conclusion. I didn't like how easily everyone's problems were solved including the bad guy's. The ending was too neat a package with everyone all lovey-dovey."
5,"14K YELLOW GOLD DIAMOND INITIAL ""S"" CHARM (1/10 CTTW)","14k Yellow Gold Diamond Initial ""S"" Charm (1/10 cttw), WHICH I COULD ONLY FIND IN ""AMAZON COLLECTION"" UNDER JEWELRY. I'M VERY SATISFIED WITH PURCHASE, SO, MUCH SO THAT I PURCHASED THE LETTERS ""A"" AND ""P"". WHICH ARE THE THREE INITIALS IN MY NAME DISPLAYED ON A CUSTOM MADE CHARM HOLDER."
2,Retirement for Two,"After reading In This Mountain I have decided that Jan Karon should follow Father Tim's example and retire. I have been a Mitford fan since I read the first book and always beat a path to the bookstore to get ""the next one"". In This Mountain isn't as bad as ""the last one"" but I found myself doing the unthinkable - skipping whole sections! And I had a headache after every few pages - poor Father Tim's head is always pounding! Sad to say - very disappointing."
2,Get real!,"I've liked Karon's Mitford books, but this one was almost too much. Must EVERY exchange between Tim and his friends include, ""Im praying for you,"" and ""And Im praying for you, too""? I started noting this early on, checked each occurrence, and there's more than forty such exchanges. Now even for a priest, that'a little much. And I have come to skip over the paragraph where Tim asks Cynthia, ""And what DON""T you love?"" Her cutesy replies are gag material. And the description of Edith Mallory ""trapping"" Tim in a locked room and trying to seduce him is almsot Saturday Night Live material. All this said, the nice telling of ordinary stories in an ordinary town is refreshing, and with the above qualifications, this still is a good read."
2,In This Mountain,"The (endless) crisis of an old man, thickly spread with religious jam. Ms Karon has given up story telling in favor of preaching, not an appealing choice."
5,Good book - the whole series is good!,"The book was in very good condition so I was very pleased. I sent a note to the seller saying I was very disappointed that the ""expedited"" service was as slow as it was. I was leaving for vacation and assumed I would receive it within 3-4 business days so I could take it on vacation. I didn't know how long it would take until AFTER I committed to having the faster service. It would have been helpful to have known how long it would have taken for me to receive it when I first committed to that service.But it's possible that information was posted and I just didn't see it."
2,Mitford Series,"My wife tried for several years to get me to read this series. ""Sissy Books"", I'd cry. I bless the day when I finally succumbed to her charms and read the books by Jan Karon. I have read them once, retired, and started re-reading them again. I laughed, I shed a few tears (that's hard for a retired police officer to say)and I had some very important lessons in life re-emphasized. I saw in Father Tim a man after God's own heart, and it makes me want to be that kind of man. I highly recommend In This Mountain as well as the entire series."
4,Important topics!,"I think not only did we get an update on the ""Mitford"" family, but some important subjects were touched upon. We are all human and we all have faults and failings, both physicial and mental -- we just try to do better through prayer and friendships."
5,Jan Karon hits the mark.,"All of Ms. Karon's books are inspirational, but this one is especially so. Lots of insight and wisdom for those times in life when walking through a valley, together with intrigue, a little suspense and plenty of light humor we can all relate to.Truly a delightful read."
5,Fr. Tim returns home,"I enjoyed this book. If you have liked the other Jan Karon Fr. Tim books, you will probably enjoy this one too.I would recommend it."
2,it's over for me,"As a fan of the earlier Mitford books I thoroughly expected to enjoy In This Mountain. Sadly, this is not the case. I believe that the author is writing for those readers who are soooo glad to have a good old small town story with the right values, that she neglects character development and plotting. Even the dialogue, origanally charming, is of a sameness. I will not be finishing this book and that is very unusual for me."
3,This one had a sad note to it,"I love all the Mitford books. I love the characters, the town and even Barnabas. But for some reason, the whole tone of the book seemed sad. With Father Tim having his diabetic blackout and the repercussions that followed were unlike the other books. I always found them uplifting so I am wondering if the next Mitford tale will be within the same vein. Is this the prelude of Father Tim's more grim illness or just an instance of showing us that life is never perfect, even in Mitford? We will have to see."
1,Price too high,"I am appalled at the high price for these used audio CD's. I can't imagine why. I would love to hear what someone else thinks.In This Mountain [UNABRIDGED CD] (Audiobook) (Book 7, The Mitford Series)"
1,In This Mountain Audio CD,"I obviously didn't read the product info well enough - this is an ABRIDGED audio book, which I don't enjoy; I like to hear every word the author wrote, and feel frustrated when the action doesn't flow smoothly as originally written, but hops and skips all over the place."
2,Disappointing,"I have been a true fan of the Mitford books, always eagerly reading the newest installment. However, In This Mountain, was a real disappointment in Jan Karon's otherwise delightful series.The storyline was disappointing, the characters weren't as interesting, and Father Tim's depression was way too drawn out. The lengthy religious aspects of the book made it feel as if I was reading a theology book instead of a book for pleasure. I will stick with the seies in the hopes that the next book will move back to Jan Karon's usual excellent work."
4,"Oh, it isn't the best............","some of Jan Karon's other books are better..... but it is always just so wonderful to be back in Mitford and Ms. Karon keeps her characters true and she also has a gentle way of reminding us what happened in the past. While this is a very easy read I thoroughly enjoyed it. As usual, at the end I was happy to have been back but sad it was over so soon. If I ever find a real Mitford I'm going to live there - along with millions of others, I'm sure!"
5,A Great Read,"I just truly love family sagas. I like the tales that take you on an emotional ride and never let's up. I love stories that make you laugh, cry, and that just plain make you think...and most of all make you feel the very feelings that the characters within are having throughout the book.This book does all of that and so much more. I was pleasantly enthralled from beginning to end."
2,To Slow for Me,"I am rating this book on my likes and dislikes; not on the way the book was written. I feel odd rating this book no more than a 2 with all the 4s and 5s it has received. But, I did not enjoy reading the book. The story seemed to drag on and on going nowhere. I could predict every move that was made in the story. There were no surprises. I guess it just wasn't my type of reading. Others seemed to have loved it."
4,A Child's View of History,"I read this book to my grandchildren before we visited the Boston Commons. It peaked their interest in visiting this historical spot and created lots of good dialog between us. Since then, I have used it in my classroom when we study the Revolutionary War. Then I show a picture of me standing in the Commons with my grandchildren. This makes history seem more real to them. I recommend this book for home and educational purposes.Nola Wilkinson"
2,Not worth the money,"This is a very Unclear step by step cd/cds. It will tell you how to use code but does not tell you what they are. The cd labels are very cheap. No disk 1 or disk to Just disks with labels.Instructions are enough to go to sleep withI would not recommend this product due to the unrealistic nature of the teaching, if you would like to call it that."
1,DID NOT BRING THE CD,THis was supposed to come with a CD and it did not come with one. Please send it ! The whole idea of this product is to have the audio reference.
5,A Modern Day Beauty and The Beast,"I watched this movie on Netflix and absolutely loved it. It sort of reminds me of ""Hard Candy"" in that it's a psychological flick and a struggle between a man and woman, but with enough romance and tenderness to have you rooting for both the good and bad guy.Both characters are wounded in some way and they both take turns caring for each other. Plus, I'm the kinda girl that gets weak in the knees for the ""manly man"" type that's tough to the world but all mushy and soft when it comes to the one he loves.I love how there is such tension between them that eventually turns into a timid friendship, then love.The only thing that I was confused about is why the film is called ""Puppy"". Once in the entire movie, the anti-hero's ex-wife calls him ""Puppy"" but that was so insignificant and at the end of the story, so I don't see the rationale behind naming an entire movie for it.Loved the ending of the movie. It was like a warm hug and a realistic ""true love"" story."
1,I loved her other cd's but not this one.,I was disappointed when i recieved this cd. Not worth the price.
4,more reviews :),"Whaaat is going on here...why has nobody reviewed this? must be cos its from new zealand..only got sold there..well i dont have this cd..stupid ppl only selling it there...thats why i came on here to see what ppl thought bout it, not write a review myself! bah. but um...i'm sure it must be good seeing as i've got the 'pure' album which was the international one, and its touchingly beautiful..more ppl review it! i want to know ppl who actually know stuff bout classical music and what their comparisons are to charlotte church..dont know bout anybody else but cant help feeling sad for her...cos i dont know why but her recent music just doesnt seem to move me anymore..tis a pity. anyway um..bit of useful information then, i recommend the pure album because its a beautiful example of someone who has a genuine voice that'll move u..if ur a critic or not, which i'm not. thanks, bye :)"
4,soothing music,"Hayley Westenra is the best. I thought this would be Valentines Day music or the like, but it is more like simulated Christmas / religious. The title does say ""gift"", but when I read the description before buying I did not think Christmas music."
4,Beautiful book!,"My 2 year old is very into mermaids at the moment, so I thought this would be perfect. It is lovely and she really likes it. The reason I took one star off was because it came with one of the ""board"" pages separated - I was able to use glue to secure it together, but would prefer not to have to fix my new products."
1,dangerous,"I was excited to receive the photo studio in a box, for a great price. But, I had to return it because the lights gave off the worst chemical burning smell. We had to air out the whole house. The lights were not sturdy and I feared they may be a fire hazard. The felt fabric that it came with had creases in them and made for unattractive photos. I learned that you get what you pay for."
4,Personal Expressions Spa Pillow,This is a great bath pillow. Holds well when affixed-Easily moved to corner if you like to sit at an angle.Cleans up easily with a soapy cloth. Well designed and looks inviting left in the tub when not in use. If you have long hair tie your ponytail high to get more comfort. I would have given this 5 stars if it was designed with a gel construction because it would lend more to comfort but I believe this will become more pliable with frequent use.
1,Like a big sponge,"This pillow is very comfortable, but the foam just absorbs the water and it's very difficult to get dry. It doesn't ""ring"" out and when it's set out to dry - it doesn't.I have used this pillow maybe five times so far and the foam already has large tears in it all over.This pillow is great in concept, but not for actual use."
5,Incredible book,"As a veterinarian interested in macroscipic and microscopic lessions in organs due to any disease in mammals, Jubb and Kennedy is the ideal book used as reference when interpreting organs lesions."
1,Hard to rate something that is broken in the box,"Don't count on the tagine getting to you whole. I have ordered three of these now. All of them have arrived broken. There is obviously a problem with packing and handling. In addition to being broken, two of them were also the wrong color. Amazon was apologetic and ultimately made an adjustment but it seemed strange that nothing was done to address the packing problem in the second and third shipments. They were all sent out with the same packing. There won't be a fourth with this brand."
1,Design looks like someone drew it with a Sharpie,"Got this as a gift and was really disappointed in the quality. Not only was the base broken, but the design was very uneven and did not look professional. It honestly looked like someone drew it on with a marker. Looks a lot better in the picture than in person. If you just need to cook and don't care how it looks, it might be great for you. I wanted to keep this out on the counter for show as well as cook from it often, so it was a major disappointment to me."
4,Tagine.. yellow?,The previous reviewer did not season her tajine.. which slowly builds up the strength of the clay.. you may use on electric cook tops but make sure the temp is BELOW 350. I prefer the regular one with glaze.
4,Great tagine!,The base is super for making larger quantities. Love the dark blue lid. Can be used on the stove-top and oven.
3,My first tagine,"My first tagine by Le Souk arrived 10 days ago. I strictly followed the instructions, including the seasoning. I avoided cooking at any high temperature, again, according to the instructions, and I used a diffuser. Nevertheless, the bottom part had a hairline crack after the third use. Great disappointment, because my hope was high for this healthy cooking."
1,It broke on the stove (very low heat)!!!,"I had to give one star because there's no zero on Amazon!I was so happy when I received this tagine! Finally I could cook and eat like I used to when I lived in the South of France (where you can find really really good Morocan & Tunisian restaurants!!). I wanted to make a surprise to my husband. I was cooking a sweet potatoes/zucchinis tagine on the electric stove (very low heat) when I heard a ""crack""... Indeed, the dish broke, after 30 min!!! The dish is supposed to stay on the stove at least 1h30!!! How come it breaks after 30 min??!!Well, you can imagine how disappointed and furious I was!Because I didn't want to ruin the dinner, I put the food in a baking dish with a pierced aluminium foil on top and then everything in the oven, 300F for 1h30. The baking dish was not as cool looking and original as the tagine but the taste was the same: delicious!In short, I do not recommend this item at all!"
4,Campbell does it again,"This is John Campbell's fourth book, and while I still liked Raid on Truman and SubZero better than this one, this is a well written story. Campbell explores the question if there can ever be a missile defense system that would truly defend the U.S.? Or would the threat then turn into one even harder to defend against? His technical expertise is again on display as he is able to explain complex technology in understandable terms. He also has included a couple of very good naval combat scenes. I recommend you read all his books including this one."
4,Cold war mystery,All and all a interesting story that keeps your interest. I would recommend to any person that enjoys techno thrillers.
5,HOOKED FROM PAGE ONE!,"JOHN T. CAMPBELL is an exceptional Action Adventure Author. Has all the best in his books. Submarines, Aircraft, Military, CIA., warfare and enemies of the U.S. You're in the Subs, on the aircraft and warships. Fighting to survive in battle. Characters are easy to identify with. The action starts from page one. Your Instantly drawn into the plots.There are several players that interact throughout his books. Each chapter takes you to actions of the different players . In other words . Never boringOne of the stronger parts of Mr.Campbell's books is the depth and the completion . All questions are answered and the Epilogue completes the books. I really enjoy the fact his books don't take the quick and easy ending. He goes way beyond a lot of Authors whose books lack depth and end quickly with little reward for the readers. Just when you think the books are about to end he throws another aspect into the mix.I've read them all. Highly recommend his book to others."
5,On Ne Change Pas (We Don't Change)-Perfect title for this great collection!,"And indeed,she doesn't change. CD 1 is French hits from the '90's and early 2000's. CD 2 is some songs from the 90's as well as many of the French songs she recorded throughout the 80's. Listen to the 1st disc and then the 2nd disc, and you'll see that her voice was just as powerful in her later years as it was in her early career. This album will definitely show you a true artist whose talent didn't diminish with age (unlike a lot of other singers out there!). Buy this-even if (like me) you're an American who doesn't understand French a bit. It is a real treat for all Celine Dion fans. (And now that I've listened to this album, I am definitely looking forward to the release of her new French album ""D'elles"" next week!)"
1,Infected with virus!!!,"Dont download here, read the reviews, has a hiden patch that will hide itself in your pc, and send all of your computers personal info to Sony (Amazon should be ashamed of them selves for allowing this)!"
5,ON NE CHANGE PAS,"THIS IS THE BEST FRENCH CD EVER.IT'S TOTALLY WORTH THE MONEY.IT HAS ALL THE SONGS IN FRENCH THAT YOU WANT ON THE OTHER ONES,BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE SONGS YOU LIKE.THIS CD COLLECTION HAS EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR,PLUS IT HAS SOME NEW SONGS IN FRENCH AS WELL AND THERE JUST AS GOOD.IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT GO AND GET IT TODAY TRUST ME IT'S WORTH IT,ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE A CELINE FAN."
5,Finally her best french material on cd,This cd is a must have for fans and people who love french music. It shows Céline best french material on 2 disc. All her hits from the the last 12 years are pressent and some oldies who probally not everybody has heard yet are there it's very fun to hear Céline at the young age. Also there are 4 new songs including the very beautiful duet with Il Divo I believe in you. The special edition contains a bonus dvd of 30 minutes which is a pleasure to watch. Well mine cd in europe was not copy protected so I have her music on my Ipod so don't let that message stop you from buying.
1,Nothing against Celine,The music on this album is just great. Celine is one of the greatest artists in the world. [...]
1,Simply annoying .,There is nothing new in this 2 CDs set.It is so simple-minded and juvenile that I can't recommend it to anyone over the age of 12.Also I do not understand why customers should spend $ 22.00 for this old material collection.
4,Better sound for the 80's titles,"After listening this compilation of greatest hits in french of Celine Dion I could feel how different sounds her music and the lirycs in french compared with the anglo ones, a good thing is that her old canadian hits are remasterized so you can enjoy much better the sound of her when she was a little a girl, but I think the duet with Il Divo has not been a good choice or at least the song choosed, it's not the perfect title to include on this compilation, but the new single: Je ne vous oublie pas, makes you remember the french-speacking Celine of the 90's.Of course I recommend this double CD compilation."
1,"Good music, ATROCIOUS format","Celine, is a very talented woman, and her French recording is great.However this thing has some mysterious encoding that prevents ripping and making an MP3.It is not stated, and it is a SURPRISE to the buyer.Audacity can generate the MP3, but usual MP3 generator fails.Neither can it be even backed up successfullyReally poor marketing, from her point.Caveat emptor, let the buyer beware!"
1,DRM = Dangerous Rootkit Malware,Thanks Sony on behalf of all virus writers. Don't play any of the 20 DRM CDs in your computer or you will likely be infected. Amazon should not still be selling this CD given that is known to cause viruses when played on a PC.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!,This CD may not play in car and home stereo CD players. Don't let it near your computer!!! It contains DANGEROUS spyware that can cripple your computer!!!Stay away from this CD!!!
1,Infected with a virus!!!!,"Sony's DRM (Digital Rights Management) copy protection software is installed upon insertion of this ""audio"" cd into your computer. The software is malicious and can ruin your pc to the point of having to format and reinstall everything. This software also sends information about your pc to a Sony server. Do you want Sony to have ALL your information? The so called ""patch"" that Sony makes available to fix this software does nothing! The software also allows for virus, spyware, and other malicious programs to hide themselves and operate without detection. Currently there are no virus scanners (Norton, Mcafee, etc.) that can detect this software or the viruses it can help hide. The same goes for spyware."
1,"5stars for Celine, -5 for SONY","I love Celine's music, but I was so disappointed to discover that this is yet another victim of Sony's Virus promoting software XCP. I am anxious to play and ripp this on my PC, but because of SONY's root-kit software, I dare not risk it. For all Celine fans, I suggest you make your voice heard too. Sony's decision to install this software without your knowledge, hide it and make it difficult if not impossible to remove, is unethical and probably illegal (such as in California). Hopefully, Celine & other artists who are victims of Sony's actions will be able to put preasure on Sony to release a clean CD devoid of this horrible software."
1,Support for getting your songs off the CD,"Please pass this along to any other Sony DRM CD page on Amazon. I'm only aware of Van Zant and Celine Dion.I purchsed a licensed copy of a program called AnyDVD a while back. Running this program in the background makes the CD think it's in a regular CD player, and it will not try to install its root kit. It also strips any and all protection from the disk, so you can use Windows Media (or whatever ripping program you prefer) to safely put the songs onto your hard drive. You'll know that AnyDVD is running by the red fox head that appears in your system tray.To download the trial (21 days, full-featured), go to slysoft(dot)com. I don't represent the site or anything, but I'm a huge fan of their products. I'm a little leery of the fact that they're based in Antigua (and they have my credit card number :-\), but you don't have to give up any type of information to get the trial. Hope this helps."
4,best of Celine (in French),"Being originally from Quebec (where Celine is from), I recognized a lot of the older songs on this double CD - specially CD 2. It is a must have for any Celine fan. Listening to her old songs brought a lot of memories back and I enjoyed the CD mostly because of this reason."
1,Voting NO to the form of copy protection,"I don't care how good or how cheap the music is, there is no excuse for the string of hazards inflicted by this artist and Sony."
1,What's all this fuss ?!?,"This is a syrupy collection of all her OLD Canadian songs.There are only four unreleased tracks,but they are all in that ugly,kitschy,grand Las Vegas style that Celine has made her own...Well,you know what I'm talking about...Plus there is the ...unfamously super-hype vocal quartet Il Divo in one song 'I Believe In You'...horrendous!Backed by a huge media blitz from Sony, expect to see a lot of phony ""great reviews"". Probably the worst album of the millenium thus far.Avoid this like the plague, and buy Edith Piaf ! Trust me!"
1,Which is worse?,"A lot of people seem to be complaining about the dangerous software on this CD. But honestly, I can't figure out which virus is worse - Sony's DRM software, or Celine Dion herself."
3,A LITTLE OVER PRICED,"I FEEL THIS SPOON IS DEFINITELY OVER PRICED. I GOT IT BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE CONSISTENT TASTING COFFEE, AND IT QUALIFIED FOR FREE SHIPPING. IT WORKS"
4,Playing Cards Historically,"This book is a well-researched, thorough and informative guide to the history of playing cards. I was especially interested in the medieval information, but found the entire work clear and easy to follow, while keeping up high standards of academic quality. I would recommend this work to anyone seriously interested in the history of the field. The Plates were also very helpful in illustrating the development and styles of cards through the centuries."
3,"Video great, audio poor","For people who love Milton Berle or one of the performers featured on a show included in this series, you will love this set of videos. We are lucky to have them, in any condition. The video portion is fine; but the audio has suffered from years of lying in storage: parts are fine, but other parts are scratchy, or have a ""wow"" sound behind them, and sometimes the sound drops out entirely, but only for a second. Again, if you love the people included in this set, go ahead and order it. Your enjoyment of the performer(s) you're interested in will keep you from noticing the audio deficits."
4,A good start,"The Singletons has really done an excellent job with their first recording. The upbeat sound of hallelujah really sets you in the mood to go deeper into a place of worship. With the help of Fred Hammond the really did put together a masterpiece. Even though they all are good singers, there is that one person that stands out from the rest. After listening to the song Hope now in him, you will understand why. She don't have to do a lot of runs for her to sound good and when she does, she does not over do it like the others on some songs.Girl you get mad props for that and you do have a special gift. All together the album is very uplifting and is full of the anoiting of God. The best tracks are Hallelujah, Hope Now in Him, and Fight On. These are the songs that really show their vocal talents. I hope we will hear a lot more of you in the future."
4,Wonderful Project,"This is an awesome CD. My favorite selection is ""All of My Days"". This song is SO powerful and ministers to your soul. This song reminds me of God's awesome power and his mercy he has shown towards me each and every day of my life."
4,Awesome debut album,"When I first heard of the Singletons, I didn't pay them much attention. But when I read such positive reviews for this album, I had to pick it up and see for myself. From the first track, I understood why people love them. Their harmonies are so complicated, but beautiful. It doesn't sound like they are trying to force a certain sound-it just comes naturally to them. I especially love ""I'll worship you all of my days"". That song is so beautiful and I keep it on repeat. If you are skeptical, I encourage you to check them out. You will really be blessed. This project is really uplifting with the nice beats and words, but there is a clear message and purpose. They really minister on each and every track. Go pick it up ASAP!"
2,freedom,"I believe the this cd has to much of Fred's musical influence. I was not impressed. This is not a recording that you would listen to over and over again, however the talent is evident. The first cut is nice."
3,Lid Problem,"I've had the same lid problem that other reviews mentioned. It is not secure for such a large pitcher; however, the filter process seems to be fine and I'm putting up with holding onto the lid."
3,Loose Lid,The lid does not stay on when you try to pour out the water. I just take the lid off and it works just fine.
4,Brita Grand Water Filter Pitcher,Recommended by friends. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised at the taste of the water. The only negative is that there is a learning curve as to how much water you can keep adding to the reservoir before you have a spillover (or cover pops off) when one tips the pitcher to pour. It's not clear to me at this point when enough is enough.
1,Just a disappointment!,"I have enjoyed an older Brita filter pitcher for years and thought it was time for an upgrade. I have regretted this purchase primarily because the top doesn't fit securely. Twice now it has popped off resulting in a flood of water, just not cool. Avoid this one."
1,"Great water, bad design","We are longtime Brita water filtration users and up until purchasing this model, were very happy. While this model filters water as well as earlier models, the design of the top cover is just terrible. As one reviewer says, "" it floats"" and doesn't sit securely on top of the pitcher. If you grab the handle and use your thumb to open the hatch to fill the pitcher with water, the whole top rocks back and falls off. I would not recommend this model to anyone."
4,Purple power,This brita water pitcher is pretty good. large enough to cook rice or soup without having to refilter several times. love the color...Only thing i didn't like about it is the filter change indicator. it is digital. and it decreases a bar every 3 weeks regardless of your usage.. the instruction manual said that it would run out of battery eventually and we would have to replace it with a new indicator... id rather have the manual number dials that indicates month and day manually.been using this for a little more than a month now. still loving it.
3,Filter Question!,"Based on the positive reviews, I just ordered the Brita 42556 Grand Pitcher. But, now, I don't know which filters to stock-up on. The numbers of the filters don't match the ""42556"" of the product. Please advise, if you can. Thanks."
1,Top Doesn't Fit!,"Not even close...what kind of quality control does this company have? This was supposed to be a cheerful splurge -- instead it's an aggravating disaster. Impossible to fit the top on, impossible to pour it with the top on....Too bad I can't give it ""No Stars"""
5,Why all the negative waves?,"Having now purchased and used this pitcher since watching the absurdly transparent negative video review this morning, I can clear up most of the problems others have written about in one word: misalignment. If the filter slot is not aligned to the insert ridge, of course it won't seal and unfiltered water will leak into the bottom chamber. If the upper chamber is put in backwards, LIKE IN THE VIDEO, of course the top won't seal!!!I have to say, however, that the old style pitcher had a larger space between the upper chamber insert and the spout so there was faster flow rate when pouring. That is why I give this product 4 stars; it could have been better. Actually 4 3/4 stars because it's a fairly trivial point.update 9/22/10:Having used this pitcher for 12 days I changed my rating to 5 stars. This is a quality product I'm very happy with."
1,Expensive waste of money--doesn't work,"I have 2 other Britas and no problem with them. This one, not only does the lid not fit, but when you finally DO manage to cram the lid on, it dribbles water because the lid spout interferes with the pouring.My respect for Brita is zero now--obviously they know about this problem and have done nothing, and keep it on the shelves to suck others into wasting $30 bucks on one.It's sad really, I bought this from Home Depot to reward myself with a larger-capacity pitcher, and only when I got home, and mine didn't work, did I think to go online and check the reviews. Really, for a water pitcher, you shouldn't HAVE to look up reviews--is it really that hard to design one that pours, and the lid fits?Sheesh. It's not rocket science. If this is how poorly they design their pitchers, what are they doing with their filters? I'm switching to another brand--I no longer trust this company to have the integrity to do anything right."
3,The top keeps falling off!,"We recently moved and the refrigerator doesn't have a water filter on it like my old one. I bought the Brita but it is driving me so crazy I have just started drinking water from the tap. The top keeps falling off. Mostly, when my husband and kids use it, but it isn't attached tightly."
2,Marginal at best,"I had been using a Pur filter for a long time. I complained to Pur that the filtered water, after standing for a while, had a metallic taste. They sent me a coupon for a free filter if I bought one. HaHa. I thought I would try the Brita Pitcher. While the water tastes very good when first filtered tastes very good. But again after sitting for a while, again the metallic taste. I am not pleased with this product and would not recommend it to any one else. I will just stick with gallons of bottled water."
2,Ugh,"I pretty much HATE this thing. The flap over the spout sticks shut. When you get it unstuck, the entire lid comes off. I've probably spilled more water out of this thing than I've been able to drink. Also, the ""timer"" seems to measure TIME only as opposed to volume. So it's really useless for a single person who doesn't go through a lot of water as the filter is still good long after the timer says to change the filter. I really wish I had returned it."
3,"OK, but it doesn't quite fit together","The Brita works just fine, but there's a weird design flaw. When you go to pour water, if you press your thumb against the part of the lid that runs flush with the handle, the top pops up slightly. I suppose if you never rest your thumb on the top of the handle, you wouldn't notice. Ideally for me, nothing would move except for the little door to refill the pitcher and the flap that covers the spout. The top just doesn't seem to quite fit right, making the pitcher feel a little bit cheap. Shame because I bought this replacing a similarly sized Brita that had broken and I don't recall ever having that problem before."
3,Would be great if the lid was better,This pitcher definitely gives you great tasting water but the lid problem almost out weights the positives. Hopefully brita will fix this flaw. Would love it with a decent lid.
4,Great Pitcher,"First, I love the color. Second, I love the size.The only problem, it is a bit heavy but it does hold 80 ozs.Had the older version but like this one better. It even has a indicator to let you know when to change the filter."
3,Poor lid design,"The purified water is great and I have no problem with the filter falling out, but the lid is HORRIBLE! It does not fit the pitcher at all and you have to hold on to it when you pour the water. I would not purchase this item again."
3,It's fine.,"This pitcher works, I can't complain too much. The electronic indicator doesn't work but I didn't really care about that so it wasn't worth returning."
5,Great Pitcher,Bought as a wedding gift for someone who really likes lime green. I personally own one and love it. Easy to maintain and provides great tasting chilled water.
2,New Design = New Design Flaw,"The lids of these things aren't shaped correctly to match the top of the handle. Because of this, anytime somebody places their thumb on top of the handle while pouring (which seems like the ""safe"" thing to do), the lid will pop off. Surely, this company has engineers that are capable of recognizing and fixing this flaw. Unfortunately, somebody must have decided it was ""good enough"" to sell instead of spending the money to correct things. Wish my ~7 year old pitcher hadn't broke- it didn't have this problem."
3,It's not so bad.,"I don't like the Pouring spout, it's curved and makes it awkward for pouring when the water is almost gone.I do like the shape size and color."
4,Brita good,Really great pitcher! It has a shape that utilizes space in the fridge. Hold a decent amount of water. My only negative is that it takes to long to filter the water. Although that is an irrational expectation though.
3,it filters but the lid keeps falling off,it holds a lot of water and it filters as expected. But the lid is not tightly adjusted so it starts to fall when you serve water
5,BEST PRODUCT EVER!!!,This pitcher fulfils my needs. Now i never have to worry about buying bottled water when im at home. I would recommend it to anyone!
2,"Good, not great","This product arrived on time but was very dirty. The inside had a bunch of the black particles in it so I ran it through the dishwasher. The grime came off but it was a little concerning at first. The filter monitor at the top doesn't work at all, but I can live without it. Finally, the top doesn't stay on tight and you need to hold it down while pouring. On the plus side, I rarely have to fill it up compared to the 6-cup pitcher I had before and I love the orange color!"
3,Stopped filling timely,"I love the water from this Brita pitcher, but after the first filling, it now takes forever to fill up the pitcher. The first time was great, but not anymore. I am not sure if I am not doing something properly but there were no instructions about this."
2,Poor quality colored plastic,"The colored versions use a significantly lower quality plastic then the rest of the white brita products. Due to this, the pour flap wouldn't open, spilling water. Solved by just removing. The lid hasn't been improved in this model and comes off fairly easily compared to other models. I'm using this to replace my Brita oceania model which has poorly designed shape and top water reservoir (angled top). This model does have a great shape for fitting in the fridge.-G"
2,Worst Brita pitcher I've owned,"The top easily flops off. It overflows into the handle while filling. My entire problem was that the lid just didn't fit on the reservoir properly. It's just not up to pat with any previous Brita or Put pitcher I've owned. I did like the digital filter reminder though. So instead of replacing the filter, I'm just going to get a whole new pitcher. I still like the taste of filtered water."
1,Don't buy unless you want to always hold the top!,"So excited to get this to replace our current Brita Pitcher. This holds a bit more, and I thought it would be fun to upgrade from white to the purple. As soon as I got it, I unpacked it and checked it out. The lid does NOT snap on like my current pitcher's does. It just rests on the top of the purple insert. When you press your thumb down on the purple part to pour, it appears as if that might help hold the entire lid down, but it does lift up some near the front. A total hassle, so I packaged it back up to return and won't be buying a new pitcher now. It's one thing if you can train yourself to remember to make sure the lid doesn't fall off, but if a guest comes over they are prone to possibly spill some water.Don't be fooled by the sleek look of this pitcher! I guess it's too much to ask that they make the lid snap on like their old designs. Ridiculous!!"
1,Wish I bought a different model,"Just got it from Amazon, and wish I had paid attention to the negative review and bought a different one. Yes lid comes right off, and it leaks. And filter falls out sometimes."
4,Brita,"First time using this and it is a lot better than buying water bottles by the case, plus more cost efficient. Yes, the top cap is a bit flimsy, but I can overlook it :) I will be using this for a while."
2,Lid does not fit properly!,"Although the Brita system itself does work and the water, surprisingly tastes better than expected I am underwhelmed with the design of the product. The lid does not fit securely in place so it needs to be held while pouring. This is a large unit and it is awkward to hold while pouring."
2,Most annoying,"Most annoying, the small cover that effectively seals the spout would suction itself on once wet and when we tried to pour, water would leak around it or actually cause the lid to fly off and water to go everywhere. We even tried creating a notch in the plastic cover, but to no avail. This one with no cover obviously solves that issue. Only slightly less annoying, the carbon bits that would leak down into the main pitcher. So far, no bits. Two thumbs up."
2,"Really pretty but not as good as the ""plain"" Brita pitcher","I love that its red. But thats pretty much where my love for this pitcher ends. Its definitely not as well made as the old Brita pitchers. Very often when you go to pour the water, the entire top of the pitcher falls off. You have to hold the pitcher with one hand and hold the top on with the other. Really annoying."
4,Top comes off,"Even when there is no water in the top part, the top comes off unless you hold it on. Expected better, but it still does it's job."
1,Total bust,Lid is loose and falls off almost with every pour. Have owned brita systems before and never had this problem.Did not get to use the product until I returned from a lengthy trip otherwise I would have returned it before the window expired.
2,"I thought I was ""upgrading""!","We've used a Brita pitcher for years, so when I saw this larger capacity one I bought it without thinking twice. Like one reviewer said, you shouldn't have to look up reviews for a water pitcher, but I wish I would have. One, the lid does not stay on like my old pitcher did. If this one has water in the top when you pour a glass it's more than likely going to leak unless you use one hand to hold the lid tightly on. Two, it takes two fills of the top reservoir to fill the pitcher, which is annoying especially when you want to pour a quick glass of water but instead you are stuck waiting for the top to empty into the bottom. Three, the lid spout flapper tends to stick at times causing water to spray everywhere but your glass. Brita, why mess with a good thing? Your older pitchers worked great, just wanted more water per pitcher. Instead I got more hassle than there needs to be."
2,Dont buy this - Horrible Lid Design,"Brita has been adamant about not redesigning this lid. Since this model has been out for a long time. Amazoners have been pretty vocal about this for some time but Britta has NOT listened yet. May be if we stop buying this, they will. Also, filters are really inexpensive at Amazon or Costco or Kmart during a sale."
1,Terribly designed and frustrating,I'll make this short and simple. The design is awful and not not well thought out. There's a gap between the reservoir and the handle so you have to be SUPER careful and steady when filling and putting it in the fridge or else faucet water will escape down the HOLLOW handle (again another horrible design) and mix in with the already filtered water. This would happen to me every time I went to go fill it and it would always spill out of the pitcher and all on my floor.I also didn't like the way the water tasted plastic-y. It still had a weird plastic taste even after I washed it.I returned it and got the Bobble water pitcher and like that one MUCH better.
2,great filter but poor lid,"Brita filters are and have always been really good, but I can't say the same for the lid on this pitcher. As others have said, the lid does not fit properly and comes off easily...lame! The one I previously purchased a few of years ago (without the electronic filter indicator) is fine and the lid is snug and never comes off, but the lid on this one is not sized properly and comes off easily on every pour, so you must hold it with your thumb or it will come off completely. Although I thought about returning it, I will keep it but would never purchase this particular pitcher again and certainly would not recommend it. Seems the quality control at Brita has become less than favorable."
3,Does its job despite a stupid design flaw,"Like many other reviewers here, I experience similar problems with the flap covering the pour spout sticking, and thus causing spillage. While it is certainly an adequate filter, I think you'd be better off looking at a different model."
3,Fixed brita lid,So I got the same problem with the lid not sealing properly. I solved the problem by heating up water in a bowl so its really hot and then pushing the end of the lid that touches the handle until it sits properly. Now it fits perfect. Would of rated higher if brita shipped it with the lid already fitting
4,Brita Grand Lid falling off,"I ordered this item and read most of the reviews and almost everyone complained about the lid falling off and spills!But, I ordered this anyway because this was the size water container I wanted! I was at first very dissapointed , because yes the lid didn't fit snugly and fell off when I pored water! I was going to send the item back and instead read all the reviews.....found one that said"" The lid only falls off when you hold the lid while pouring! Tried and he was absolutely right, if you don't hold the lid and just pour , your fine, no water spills! Weird, but true! You would think that loose fitting lid would fall off if you don't hold it on while pouring, but it stays! I wish the company would make this clear! I myself would prefer a snug tight fitting lid, but it doesn't spill if you don't hold the lid while pouring! Thanks to the Gentleman's review, that I read!"
3,Really annoying cover that won't stay on,"If it weren't for that, then this pitcher which was supposed to be a replacement for an older Brita, would stay in my house. Instead, I am working with Brita who is SUPER NICE about helping me out. I got this from Target but threw the receipt away thinking I would love this thing. Now I have to choose a replacement pitcher and Brita says they'll send me one of my choice. Isn't that really cool of them!I would NOT recommend this pitcher. The design is flawed. The top nearly floats on top the pitcher with no hook/latch to keep the thing on the pitcher. So like others have said, it will fall off too easily. To the point that it is annoying to refill. The bad design does not make this an easy pitcher to use."
1,"Lovely to look at, annoying to use.","I love the look of this Brita, and I was super excited to get it (I have a growing collection of purple kitchen stuff). However, as others keep mentioning, the top falls off VERY easily, and the part you flip up to refill it comes off the hinge all the time. Even being careful, I still manage to make a mess every once in a while - the worst part is, if you've overfilled the Brita (bottom is full, some water on top still left to filter), and go to pour, the water on top pushes the top part off, getting water everywhere and get unfiltered water in whatever you were just pouring).Oddly enough, the top fits perfectly if you put it on backwards, but doesn't pour very well."
4,works pretty good...,"I held off buying a brita pitcher for years--1- because I was skeptical about how well they worked-- 2--I thought they were ugly (especially those I had seen at friend's places--that they had had for years--never really looked clean) 3--whenever at friend's places--it seemed we always had to wait for the water when we wanted it.I am happy with my purple pitcher--1st its purple--which makes anything better in my opinion (and I imagine won't get the same ""dirty"" look white pitchers get over time. And it tastes pretty good--very subtle change from the tap in the positive direction. Much easier that carrying huge bottles of water--and I've found a nice rhythm of keeping it filled with water available.I know my local water is ""safe"" barring high chlorine taste at times--otherwise I would keep getting the multi-filtered-UV treated water from my health food store."
2,Cheaply made but expensive.,I just bought one of these pitchers and I don't think it's possible for me to be more unhappy with it. The thing cost $30 and the lid will not stay on it. It comes off when you're pouring water and causes water to spill everywhere. Neither the main lid nor the water refill lid stays in place. If you buy this product you will be sorry.
2,Poor design,"I've been using this Brita ""Grand Pitcher"" for about half a year now, and it constantly irritates me. What I find most maddening is how slowly the purified water pours out. They only allowed a very narrow passageway for the filtered water to exit the pitcher, as you can see in the picture. So to empty the pitcher, you have to just stand there for a while wasting time as it oh-so-slowly trickles out. And if you tilt it too much to encourage it to flow faster, the filter falls out.Just poorly designed."
4,Brita Water Pitcher,I have this Brita pitcher at home and now at my office as well. No more plastic bottles -- EVER!!! I also think the Brita filtered water tastes better than bottled water.
4,Brita 80 Ounce Water Filtration Pitcher,Using this pitcher is an easy way to filter drinking and cooking water. The filter is easy to place in the pitcher and has a good life span of approximately 2 months. It's a cost effective produce and a much better choice as opposed to bottled water which is a definite waste of money.
3,Brightly coloured,"I loved the colour and the size so I bought it despite the bad reviews about the lid. The reviews are true. The lid kinda balances on top of the jug but it doesn't fly off. When pouring I just put my thumb on the part of the lid that rests on the handle.Easy to assemble (once I had the part that holds the filter around the right way) and the filter rate is fine. I didn't instantaneously expect the entire jug to be filled. I think it took me two or three times to fill the jug completely.It didn't fit in the door of my fridge which is quite large so I put it on a rack.Also, the feature about when to replace the filter I can do without but I really wanted it this colour and it does the job and water tastes great."
4,Safe water,"Good to have at home.Water taste much,much better.I also love the available colors.I like this system very much.Great price also."
1,Poor Design... Let me count the ways...,"Too tall, instead of fat, so you can't get it under the tap without contaminating the pitcher bottom from your kitchen sink (usually the germiest place in any kitchen).Lid-opening button is in a concave area where water sloshes, so unless you wash your hands each time you fill, you're putting germs in with each refill and slosh.Didn't I buy this to get germs out of water, not put them in!You can't pour from it while it's filtering, like my old first-generation Brita.After 2 months the white insert that holds the filter got VERY stuck in the pitcher. No obvious tool would get it out. My choices: make an L-shaped tool to remove it or return the pitcher. I returned it.I miss my original Brita pitcher!"
1,I can SEE that the water isn't clean...,"I really should've read these reviews first, but I just bought this model from Walmart. Our water well developed a leak today, so I bought this filter pitcher to use until its fixed. The water from the faucet is pretty reddish/brown from rust leaking into the tank, but the water in the filtered part of the Brita is still at least 50% as reddish/brown. So apparently the Brita is great at removing miniscule microscopic elements from water, but it can't remove rust and/or dirt? What a waste, going right back to Walmart."
2,Poor Design,"I have had several Brita pitchers and this one is just poorly designed. I didn't get it from Amazon as I needed it that day.*Yes the filter likes to fall out and I do push it in.*There are many groves, edges and lips around where the lid sits and the lid. This gets DISGUSTING! and I clean mine regularly.--including mold in he hing area*I don't like that you can not pour while it is filter, oh you can but not easily.I am actually here shopping for a new one."
2,Bad design,The top is loose and you have to hold it on when you pour water.The electronic counter that let's you know when to replace filters works one and a while.Ii like the old design better.
3,Filter is good but design is horrible!,"The water that comes out of this is great, very well filtered, etc. No problems there. But the design is so horrible! Water spills out the back if you've just put water in to filter and you tip it slightly backwards, it pours out the front and/or the top comes off and spills water out if you try to pout while there's water filtering. And the handle is nowhere near strong enough to support the weight of all the water you can fit in the pitcher. I'll keep using this while I still have filters for it, but after that I'm going back to Pur."
4,MMM Good Water Bad Top,"Well I REALLY LOVE the clean taste of the water and I expected it from Brita. I got this (my favorite color) Purple Brita Grand knowing that a few of reviews stated a problem with the lid coming off quite easily & IT DOES, one would thing that Brita's QA department would have noticed this and correct it by now. What I did to correct this problem was to take a rubber band and placed it under the lid around the part that fits into the pitcher & PRESTO it actually works...take a HINT Brita. Otherwise a GREAT Taste Producing thing to have. ;-)"
4,Great Water,"The Brita filtration pitcher was one of the best investments I've made. I didn't know water could taste so good, and refreshing. I received the product in a timely fashion. I took it out of the box, washed it and was enjoying clean, clear, crisp water in no time. The only down fall is, that it takes a minute for the water to filter thru. It's worth the wait though. Thanks amazon! The product is everything you said it was."
3,Decent Pitcher,"I agree with the complaint from other people about the lid being poorly designed. But this isn't the first Brita pitcher I have bought so I was aware of the issue and was also fine with the filter change indicator merely keeping track of time and not actual water usage. I have bought bad filters with the black spots only once. If that happens again, I will seriously consider not buying Brita picthers again. But the pitcher's body is of sturdy construction so I feel it is an adequate pitcher."
1,"Great water, stab-worthy pitcher design","Nice, fresh tasting water. However, the non-fitting lid and leaky pour spout makes me want to stab myself for not taking it back for a refund the day after purchase. 5 stars for taste, negative 3 stars for pitcher design for a 1-star average."
3,What they don't tell you until you buy,"I got one of the purple pitchers at a Goodwill, and got two unused filters off ebay to use with it. The whole point of getting this was to get rid of fluoride, which is thyroid poison that keeps you fat and stupid. Only after I got the filters did I find out that they leave in fluoride. So now, I have these items that there is no point in using. I wouldn't have bought either, if I knew ahead of time."
1,a trap for the unwary,"Not sure if Britta has changed their system but, unless you are very careful to seat the filter and system correctly you get a nice surprise, water all over the counter and floor. I filled the top last night got up this morning to pour a glass of water. The filter was, somehow stopped up and the entire contents spilled all over the counter. Bad design. I will go back to tap water."
1,"I hate it, give it a pass","For as much as I paid for this thing, it was a very disappointing product. The lid DOES NOT STAY ON. If you don't hold on to it while pouring the lid falls off and water goes everywhere. The filter does not fit snugly in the compartment and if you tip the container to get the last of the water out the filter falls out too. And I continuously get carbon particles in my glass of water, no matter how much I rinse out the holding compartment. I gave up on Brita before and I think I will again. I only got it to try to help the environment a little as I tend to buy gallon jugs of spring water, but I'm not sure it's a fair trade. And it DOES NOT fit in my door compartment which is supposed to be specifically for these sorts of items. Interestingly gallon jugs fit quite well in my fridge compartment."
5,Mostly Better Brita,"Love Brita products--replaced my last pitcher with this one. Oddly, takes a really long time to pour out water compared to my last pitcher--the same model type. Slightly annoying."
1,This pitcher is driving me to drink (not water),"I don't think I have ever commented on a product before but feel compelled in this case because it is so over the top. The handle on this Brita filter will NOT stay on. Every time I touch it, not exaggerating here, the plastic handle falls to the floor. When I fill it, it falls off in the sink. When I open the refrigerator, it clatters to the floor. If I look at is funny, bingo. Get the picture? This pitcher is very poorly constructed and I would not recommend it to anyone. Unless, of course, you really enjoy picking things up off the floor over and over again. Buy something else. Seriously. Don't do it."
2,Very slow to fill,"This pitcher is tall and as such does not fit under my tiny apartment sinks. This forces me to hold the pitcher at an angle while I fill it. The reservoir does not hold enough water to fill up the pitcher, so you've got to fill up the reservoir, wait for it to filter into the main area and then fill it again. If you choose not to fill the reservoir a second time then you've got approximately two servings of water before you have to fill it up again. So if you like to constantly fill up plastic pitchers this is the product for you! Brita, please make this pitcher wider."
4,My lid never falls off..,I've been using this Brita for about 8 months. My lid has never fallen off.. even when the pitcher was completely full.
1,Complete Disappointment,I have been using Brita pitchers for years. The quality of their products has degraded to the point that this was my last Brita purchase. This particular pitcher is difficult to manage when it's full and the top either leaks or pops off and you end up with a mess to clean up.
4,Does the job,"I use this all the time. Only negative is that the top is not as secure as the smaller version, so I can't pour while there's water in the top. Also, if I over-fill, water spills out of the back of the lid by the handle. But otherwise, no complaints."
5,Large orange water pitcher - bright and useful!,Beautiful bright orange pitcher! Large capacity - just enough for my family of 5. Very convenient to pour water into kids water bottles. My previous pitcher (chrome) had lid falling off all the time. This one has lid tightly attached. Bright orange color encourages kids to use the pitcher more often! I am very pleased with the purchase!
4,I like it,"I do like the Brita 35378 Grand 80-Ounce Water Filtration Pitcher, it is a very good product, easy to clean and use. I have to fill it not full because it gets too heavy."
3,Not the best design....shop around some more,"I was stationed in Germany (Brita's International HQ) and have noticed the US gets the sub-par designs compared to what is in Europe. Funny, since all the US products I got there were the sub-par versions. Anyhow, I don't recommend this water pitcher. The filters are ridiculously expensive for carbon bits in plastic (they are about 6x the price of the superior Euro design). I had to duct tape the top to the pitcher-body to keep the top from coming off. It didn't fall off when pouring, but instead it always slid off when my thumb made contact with the lid (I dare you to hold this pitcher without any thumb-contact). In my opinion PUR makes a better designed pitcher that is closer to Euro Brita."
4,It is BIG and bulky. Watch out; you will spill the water!,"I got this as we recently moved to a new house and our RO system has not been installed yet. I despise bottled water so I decide to get a Brita pitcher. Well, I did not think how big this is when I bought it. It is really BIG and takes a lot of space in the fridge. Also, it is tall so I can only put it on the top shelf. Now the problem is that when the pitcher is full, it is quite heavy so you need to be careful when you are taking it out of the fridge as you can easily spill the water. Maybe I should think it is my arm strengthening tool!As for the quality of the water, it gets the job done; it tastes much better than the water out of the faucet.But, I will definitely go back to the RO system for its convenience and ease of use. It is expensive but it is worth the money as I can have good tasting, clean water without creating more landfills."
5,A-OK,"I don't know what all the fuss is about. I bought this model more than a year ago and it's absolutely ok.I NEVER spilled any water.Common sense is all you need.For example, if a container holds eight ounces of water you have to know that if youtry to put 10 ounces in that container, 2 ounces will spill. Duh?"
2,Replacement,"Got this to replace our old slim pitcher. Over all it's as good as our old one which we liked because it does filter the taste of chlorine in our tap water, but the top keeps fallen off into to sink which the old one never did! There's no clip or anything to keep it on the pitcher, so each time you tilt it to refill, down goes the top. It's just very annoying."
1,Big problems right out of the box,"I just bought one of these. I've used Brita pitchers before and have had no issues with them. However, I can't get the top reservoir out of the pitcher. Moreover, there's a paper booklet stuck in the pitcher. I can't find any instructions on Brita's website about how to remove the reservoir. What a pain."
1,"If you like the taste of plastic, this is your lucky day","For years I've used the clasic brita pitchers without problems. Then I bought 2 of these more modern brita pitchers, one with a gren top, one purple. It's been a month now and the water has tasted like plastic from day 1. I keep thinking the plastic taste will go away, but it doesn't. I can't believe more people aren't complaining about the awful taste. Yuk!"
2,Brita 42556 Grand Pitcher,I think the Brita filters do a good job of filtering the water. I just wish the pitchers were better made. I get a couple of years out of a picture before they fall apart.The lid also does not really fit very securely. If you try to pour water before while the upper chamber is filled the lid comes off and the water spills out all over.
1,Surprisingly Bad,"This is the 3rd Brita water pitcher I've ever owned. The first two were great (needed a new one because they were left with roommates). This pitcher is unlike them though.Cons-Top cover doesn't fit at all, falling off far too easily-Water leaks out the back handle-Filter comes loose while pouring-Bad filter fit means black carbon particles get in to drinking water belowWe'll buy another Brita, because we have 4 unused filters and are used to the taste, but hopefully the next model we try will work better."
1,Disappointment,"We received this as a wedding gift and loved it at first. As the time to replace the filter drew nearer, the water began to taste really, really unpleasant. It is nice to have the indicator to show when the filter needs replaced but it is difficult to reset after replacing the filter.As many reviewers have stated, the lid is not the best. It doesn't fit on very well, in fact it seems to just rest on top of the pitcher instead of clipping on. Also, the spout often needs to be held open as opposed to coming opened when pouring as it should. When the spout sticks, it makes a giant mess and is unpleasant especially when pouring water in the dark at 1am.We are currently looking into replacing this pitcher with something else. Although the complaints I have sound like minor, trivial things they are actually quite frustrating as the product is not functioning as it should."
2,cheap lid,I've been a loyal Brita pitcher owner for years and years. We bought this new one and after only a few days the spout lid broke off. After another week the middle of the lid snapped off. Now the whole rest of the lid won't stay on and there is nothing on top at all. We paid over $30 and I am NOT happy at all... Plus my kids can't stand the black specks from the filter. Might be time to change our filter system.
2,Black residue swimming around?,"*What are the little black particles swimming around after I fill it with water ? (It's not from our water, they're coming from the filter) Maybe it's something to help purify the water, but I don't think we're supposed to be consuming them.*The filter (which came with the pitcher) doesn't fit as it should, so it leaks what ever residue builds in the top compartment?*We CAN'T drink the water filtered in this pitcher.*The lid doesn't fit quiet right, but it hasn't presented a problem thus far (maybe I've become accustomed to lower standards since we've been manufacturing everything in China).I had high expectations... I might anticipate this level of performance had I purchased it at the Dollar store, but for $30? I should have known better, after all, it is plastic. I only paid $65 dollars for a real glass electric kettle made in Germany... a plastic pitcher shouldn't cost $30. Talk about an exponential profit margin!"
2,Should have taken notice of the reviews,Looks great...however the lid keeps falling off when pouring water which is starting to get very annoying! I would not purchase again.
1,JP,"I purchased 2 of these within a month. The first one that I purchased, the lid did not fit properly. It would leak water when pouring. I returned it for another one, only to find that it was made the same way. I promptly sent Brita an email questioning this DEFECT. They basically told me to STUFF IT. That they were all made that way. It's funny, the Brita pitcher that I replaced, was made much better than the new ones. I do not recommend this item, it is of very POOR quality, and you will not be happy with it."
2,Horrible user design,"Does it's job in cleaning the water. Instantly tastes better.Does take a few minutes for the thing to fill. You fill the reservoir in the top and wait for it to drain to the bottom, come back a few minutes later and repeat until filled.It has a filter use counter in the top that measures the number of pours and then tells you to replace the filter. The filters are expensive - bad for the consumer and good for the company. I would guess the counter runs a little on the short use side.The design is horrible though when pouring. The lid doesn't anchor to the top - it simply lays on it. Tilt to pour and ""BAM"" the lid falls off onto your glass of water. I have cleaned up more filtered water than I have drank with this.I'm not sure what that does to the filter counter - probably throws it off.Really BRITA - how did this make it through user testing?I would tell you to look at some of the other models."
2,I don't like it but we're still using it,We bought ours at a Target and the lid does not stay on and would fall off if not held in place. Also the orange plastic piece that snaps on the handle persistently comes off. We would return this if it didn't involve a 40 minute train ride out to the Target near us. Maybe the ones sold on Amazon are of a different stock and are not defective. Normally we're a huge brita fan - not so much with this purchase.
1,Green Mold in Pitcher,"I have used Brita water pitchers for about 15 years. A few years ago I replaced my old one because it was looking old, it worked fine. With the new one that I got it developed green mold once in a while so that I would have to scrub the pitcher monthly. There were parts of the pitcher that I could not clean that remained green colored. So I scraped the pitcher and drink water from my tap now. I did some research and found many other similar complaints."
1,terrible,"The ergonomics are terrible, the lid falls off at the slightest angle, the filter also dislodges at moderate angles, and it lets carbon bits get EVERYWHERE. Worst Brita model by far.Do yourselves a favor and buy theBrita Marina Complete Water Filtration Pitcher, Clear/Whiteinstead. I bought it as a replacement for the Grand, and every day feel a sense of great relief."
1,Poor design,This pitcher is very poorly designed. The lid comes off very easily resulting in water splashing everywhere. I would not recommend this product.
2,top doesnt stay on,I have a slim brita pitcher and decided to buy this model for more water capacity. I bought it at target. I took it home and filled it up and the lid and the flap covering the filter kept falling off. The design is cheaply made. lm so disappointed. I'm returning the pitcher and may just have to buy from a different company.
1,Incompetently Designed,"The lid to this pitcher doesn't even fit! It falls off when you pour water. It even falls off when you move the pitcher. It's easier to just throw the lid away, because the water is going to slosh out whether there is a lid on it or not. It's almost as if the lid is designed for something other than this product. It's shocking to me how Brita could think that it was okay to put something like this out on the market. Do not buy!"
4,Like it,"I have trouble keeping the lid on this pitcher, but other than that, I like it. I really like that it lets me know when I need to change the filter."
4,"Big help, awkward to hold",This Pitcher was a wedding gift and we love it! Always great tasting water and the indicator/filter works well to let us know when its time to change. We have had it for 2 years and appreciate the luxury of having filtered water instead of the calcium-ridden cholorine tasting garbage where we live.Downside to this pitcher; when it is full and you are trying to poor one-handed it is VERY awkward and heavy to hold. I'm usually holding my daughter or trying to do other multi-tasking and am trying to make a bottle or poor a glass of water at the same time; it puts strain on my wrist that I know if we had one of the taller/thinner Brita systems; it would probably eliminate that pain. Our solution is to keep a smaller vessel filled with the filtered water and keep them both in the fridge. All in all; WAY cheaper than getting a big bulky 5 gallon back breaker delievered every couple weeks.
4,Yeah it works,It filters water. It does what it says it will do nothing more nothing less. If this water filter could have a better top I would be a bit happier but it still works regardless.
2,Kill the Messanger,"I was wore out with this book, the title had nothing to do with the story. The whole book was 3-4 days long and if I was the police I would have locked up Goldy."
3,Killer Pancake,"The compliments: It's full of low fat recipes. It's funny and pretty fast paced. It has good characters. It was a well written mystery.The complaints: The ending was rather abrupt. It left me questioning what happened to everyone besides Goldy. I wish Goldy dealt with her abusive ex-husband better instead of continually having to have someone else defend her. It's time for her to take up kick boxing, judo, karate, skillet tossing, something! I didn't find the murderer's reason for killing plausible. The author describes Colorado well but at times goes overboard;some parts of the book read like a brochure."
3,A little far-fetched,"While the ""Spare the Hares"" people were a little gruesome, I did like the underlying theme of ""beauty without an expensive and time-consuming makeup regime"" and the laissez-faire attitude Goldy takes with her appearance, while still being happy in her relationship! Oh, yeah - there was a mystery, too (sometimes I focus on the oddest things). The mystery was farfetched and overreached a bit, but the colorful characters keep you interested and wondering until the very end. I did notice that these are not books you want to read while on a diet. She describes the food with far too much relish! Plan on feeling the need to get up and snack while reading this series (though she includes plenty of delicious-sounding recipes, so there's no excuse not to whip up something mouth-watering in the kitchen when you take a break to rest your eyes)"
3,Sprout a Spine Goldy...Please,"The book is a quck and fairly enjoyable read. You will fall in love with all of her recipies and business follies. However, after having read all of the preceeding books in the series I was somewhat disappointed with this offering.When the books opens, she make a few comments that lead you to wonder if she has forgotten she is married and why she married someone that she is not too comfortable with, even though the previous book was about the wedding. My only other problem with the book was how both she and her new husband (a police officer) deal with her still abusive ex-husband. No cop would let this situation get so out of control (I am from a law enforcement family). And Goldy, for all of her fearlessness in investigating is a total wimp with her ex."
3,The killer pancakes killed the book,"I like Davidson's mysteries, but this one bored me to death. There was no continuity. Seemed as if castastrophes with Goldie were forced. Too many loose ends. Not worth the time."
3,Dumb Doughnuts,"Goldy is aggravating and I can now see why the jerk beat her with regularity. While he was at it he should have pounded some sense into Arch, who is growing up to be as stupid as his mother."
4,Mystery and fat free,"Once again, I was immediately drawn into Goldy's world and had trouble putting the book down. This was her BEST yet and the recipes were to DIE for. If you have not been hooked yet on this series, you will after reading this boo"
4,You know you want to,"Diane Mott Davidson is an old standby for me. Whenever I'm in a bookstore, I can look for her titles on the shelf and all is right with the universe. This is a series of mysteries with the same character, Goldy the caterer. Though she isn't a detective, her job involves her in a lot of situations other 9-to-5ers might not run into, and that's the hook of the book as it were.Killer Pancake is light fluffy fun (the allusion to pancakes here is intended). And there are recipes, so who can fault that? I recommend any of her books. The subplot of her relationship with ""the jerk"" may get a little old for you if you read enough of her stuff, but let it ride. Every great lady has to have a few flaws. Killer Pancake is just one more in a fun little series. Bon appetit."
1,EDITING OR CONVERSION ERRORS!,"I liked the story but could not concentrate because of the constant grammatical errors! Almost every time the word ""close"" or ""closed"" was supposed to have been used it appeared as ""dose"" or ""dosed."" There was a lack of punctuation so sentences ran on and recipes included misspelled words such as ""portobfxo"" instead of ""portobello"". Most glaring was Goldy's best friend being named ""Maria"" rather than ""Marla"" as she is called in the other books in the series. I found these errors very irritating and was surprised that no other reader commented on them. My other kindle books did not have nearly this amount of errors. Clearly there is a need for better proofreading in the conversion process!"
2,Too many deaths for one character to bear.,"Like other reviewers, I found this offering was just so-so. It may be that I'm weary of Goldy always finding dead bodies, always having mini-breakdowns, and Goldy's loved ones always being under suspicion. It seems churlish of me to complain about very well-described human emotions to traumatic death, but after four or five stories it's just gotten a bit tedious for me. Let Goldy solve a murder that's not directly related to her little family for a change."
5,3 album of the legit ballaz,this is an aight cd. It has a lot of chicago released songs dat know one has ever heard but u gotta have extreme pride to love this cd or else let someone else buy it instead of the haters. LOVE IT chi love to the fullest
4,The Horse doesn't need a rider,"That's right,Neil Young does not appear & that's just fine. With Neil or without,Crazy Horse is one of the most formidable sounding rock bands on the planet. If you like Neil's albums with the horse,then give this a try. The sound of rock & roll the way it should be..."
4,LIVE IN COPENHAGEN 1972,"The sound quality is a bit off but if you'r a Mc Leaniac, help yourself. This is not a bootleg. It did come out on LP stateside in the late 70's. The tracks run long. Apparently only 2 of them were on the LP, 1 on each side. Parker's Mood runs the longest at 19 min, complete with bass solo. A bit tedious but bearable. Kenny Drew leads the rhythm section."
1,What a mess!,"This is probably the worst produced and printed book I've seen in many years. Typos, misprints, paragraphs separated.Note that I'm not talking about the content, which remains to be read, but rather about the production itself. It is so bad that even glancing through it immediately highlights problems - no need to look hard."
2,"Great idea, needs work.","When I first put this on my cupboard door, I was so impressed, I told everyone I knew about it. However, within maybe two weeks, the adhesive wore down I suppose and the spices would fall every time I opened the door. I can't get them to stick back on, I even tried more glue. Now I am left with sticky tape marks on the cupboard door and still a mess for my spices. It's a great idea, though.... if it worked."
3,Tight fit!,"I bought this for the little McCormick spice containers, like the top row in the picture. They fit VERY tightly. I am afraid the plastic is going to crack after putting them in and out a few times. Even if it holds up, it takes 2 hands and too long to get the spices in. Its more appropriate for the McCormick spices in the bottom row of the picture. The sticky back of the clips is very strong. If I could take them down I probably would, because they are just a pain to get the spices back in."
2,I prefer my spices not on the floor.,"A year ago or so I bought these, and they worked wonderfully. I have since moved, and because these worked so well in my previous apartment, I ordered them again (the sticky part on the back of them makes them usable for only a single application). This second set of spice rack organizers does not work. They held for maybe a week or so, but now each day I come home to discover one or more of the three racks has fallen in my cabinet (or on the floor since that's what happens when the cabinet door is opened). Also, the plastic neck that holds the spice container is already beginning to lose its shape."
3,Only fits large McCormick spices,"I didn't realize it is not possible to use this rack for anything other than larger bottles of McCormack spices. Bummer! I will never use this. Should have paid closer attention to the pictures. Suppose I could use it for Ms. Dash, but I don't use those. Oh well."
4,OK short term option,"Their price is one of their main assets. If you want some organization while on a low budget, this is a good choice. However, you can of get what you pay for. They are not a long term solution."
2,Worked Great for a month or so,"I liked the concept of these. But after a month, they came off. I tried using super glue - that worked for a few weeks but they're falling off again.I think the only way they're going to stay up if they're screwed in."
4,Nice,"I like it. It is not all my spices size, but that's exactly what I wanted. Be careful, this is made havy door of cabinet, and it can be don't closed."
2,"great idea, not well executed","These racks are a great space saving idea. However, I have had mine up on the inside of a solid wood cabinet door for about a month and it keeps falling off (double faced tape stays on cabinet, plastic rack piece comes off). I would also recommend separating the individual racks so they arent in a strip of 4. If you are using slightly larger sized spice bottles the plastic will stretch out unevenly at the ends causing the bottles to fall out."
2,Disappointed,These clever spice holders are a great idea if only they lasted for more than a few months. Really saved me some time and hassle searching my spice cabinet until they started popping off and landing on our heads. Very disappointing.
2,Poor Adhesive,"The concept of great. I like the idea of having the spices organized, at the ready and a quick view. Unfortunately the tape that is used to stick on the organizers is very poor. The organizers keep falling off. Several times I have opened my cabinet to have everything fall down on me. I would not recommend this particular brand at all. We are now looking for a better solution to keep the racks on the cabinet doors."
1,broke in one week,This is cheap strips of plastic and while it looks fine the first of three strips broke (permanently( after 5 days and the second did so after 7 . . . if you only have small PLASTIC spices you might be OK but even small GLASS spices are way too heavy for it.
3,Doesn't fit all types of spices. Cheaply made.,"The kinds of spices I use do not stay in the holders; they slide right out. This holder seems to be specifically designed for the spice bottles such as McCormick that have kind of the hour glass shape. It also works for the smaller spice containers. Also, make sure you align the strips first to make sure your cabinet is going to shut all the way prior to sticking the strip onto the cabinet door. I made the silly mistake of just sticking them on and then my cupboard door wouldn't shut all the way once I put the spices in the holders because the spices hit the shelves in the cupboard.Overall, the product is very cheaply made and I don't foresee it holding up very long once the adhesive loses its stickiness."
5,This is a good way to organize spices,"This is a good way to keep spice containers organized and easy to find. Each package includes three racks and each rack has four clips for spice containers. We have a lot of spices, so I ordered three packages. The racks were easy to install on the inside of a cabinet door. Warning: Be sure that the racks are installed where they will not run into a cabinet shelf. I put one in the wrong place, and had to remove it which destroyed the rack. Other than that, no problems."
1,"Great idea, poor quality","I bought these a few years back. Put them from top to bottom of one of my cabinet doors. Worked great till the little ""arms"" started breaking off or weakening enough to lose the spice bottle. Now I have about 1/3 of them stuck to my door with no ""arms"" and I'm still trying to figure out how to remove them without ruining the wood."
2,These work great for a while but then they break...,When I first got these I loved them. They saved so much room and allowed me to be so much more organized. However they are made of a rather thin plastic and after a while the arms tend to break off and you are left with lots of broken spaces with nowhere to store your spices again. Once again I'm searching for a great spice organizing solution. All in all I would not recommend these due to the lack of long term durability.
1,I told myself so!,"When I ordered these spice brackets I was very skeptical and had a very bad feeling about them. I ordered them anyways and wish I hadn't almost immediately. They seem like something you would get from a flea market or something. Very cheap, ears snap off easy and the sticky tape does not hold very long at all. I ended up taking them all down and used additional double sided tape to stick them to my workshop wall in the basement. I use them now for holding odds and ends of tools and stuff that doesn't need the ""clip"" option. Works fine for that..."
1,Won't hold the spices,"Terrible product. Mounted on cabinet door but won't hold spices. Jars keep falling on the counter, and two already broke."
1,Not worth the money,"I was super excited about my purchase of these and was ready to organize my spices. Well, after about 3 days the holders started falling and the tape was not sticking. Very disappointed. :/"
5,spice rack,"Very easy to install, was worried it really wouldnt hold that much weight but it does! No nails or screws, but super heavy tape that you affix and heat with a hair dryer. Works perfect in our camper"
3,Marginal,These should advertise they are not made to take the weight of a small glass spice jar. It's a good idea. Needs work.
4,Great Buy!,"The Spice Clip Set really solved my problem. Now my spices are easily accessible. They were easy to install. My only is concern is whether they will get ""stretched out"" over the long-term. But as of now, I love them! And the price is certainly affordable. I highly recommend them!"
1,Not worth buying,"I bought some spice rack organizers at an RV store that worked wonderfully for storing my spices. I thought I was ordering the same exact item, but was sadly wrong. The plastic on these was quite a bit thinner than the others I bought. I went ahead and put them up anyway. They didn't even stay attached to the adhesive backing! The adhesive stayed stuck to the cabinet, but the plastic spice holders fell away.This product is a flimsy excuse for spice rack organizers. I was happy with the speed and delivery from the company, but did not receive the quality product I thought I had ordered."
3,No Hold Spice Holders,"I read the reviews before purchasing with the understanding that I would probably have to replace the adhesive that comes with them. I was correct. They spice holders were attached to my doors for one day before falling. I even cleaned the door surface with Alcohol before applying. That did not help. The adhesive they used on this product is very poor. It separates from the holders even faster than it separates from the doors.I will be purchasing some 3M quality adhesives strips as the holders are a great idea and help you find both medications and spices much easier. Note to manufacturer, if you can read english, read the reviews!"
2,Not what I had hoped for,"I registered for these products and was so excited when I got them that I immediately put them up on my cabinet doors. They were so perfect. However, by the next day, some of the arms has already loosened so much that the jars started falling whenever I shut the door. Now almost all of them are loose. I have to close the cabinet doors super gingerly in fear of the jars falling, but even when I do that, I'll still hear the bottles falling inside of the cabinet hours later even when no one has been anywhere near the kitchen. I'm really disappointed with these. :("
1,size matters,"I bought these to organize my many spices in the small jars. and found out rather disappointingly that if I can force the little McCormicks bottles into the clip,( as they are pictured) trying to get them out again was nearly impossible. And I even broke two of the clips before I was ever able to mount them to the wall."
2,"Great idea, but...","Awesome for a few weeks. But then the pastic racks started separating from the tape. Okay, I thought, maybe I need to reinforce the tape. So I lined each piece with two strips of newly bought tape. Still only lasted a couple days before racks and spices started to fall off (even the small bottles were to much weight). I got to frustrated to try again but I am holding on to them just in case I decide to screw them into the door...."
1,They just don't work,Within a week they had fallen off the door. The adhesive is not very strong. I've been duped.
4,Great space saver! Great for prescription bottles too.,"I love the fact that I can open my cupboard and see all my spices. It's a little hard to remove and reinsert spices but once you get the feel of it, it's not too bad. Very study adhesive coating on the back. Also , I like that you can snap and separate them one for one, etc, if you'd like."
1,Don't bother,"These work very well with the kind of spice container that is tall and has an indented neck. If the bottle is cylindrical (no indentation) or short and cylindrical, it's very difficult to impossible to get the jars in the holders. I threw mine out."
1,spice rack,This item was just too cheap looking so I didn't even take it out of the package~ you would have to be very careful putting your containers in the clip or I believe they would break right away!
1,try something else!,BOOOOOO!!!!I did EVERYTHING the directions said to do... clean surface with alcohol... let dry. Use a blow dryer on the adhesive before sticking to the surface. they lasted about 20 minutes - and my spices were barely half full!At least they were cheap - but you get what you pay for!
1,Not for glass jars of spices,"I bought two sets of these spice racks and installed them according to the directions. The problem I encountered was that the racks didn't hold the glass jars of spices firmly enough -- they fell to the counter almost every time we opened the cabinet, even when we opened the door slowly."
1,Junk,"The bottles pop out of these, falling making a mess, breaking, just a waste of money. About half of my spice containers didn't fit."
3,handy cheap,"Penzey's sells the smallest size jar of spices for about one dollar each. Since spices usually have a shelf life of one year and many spices are not used heavily but are required for some recipes, I have about thirty new little jars in an airtight bin. This makes a chore of sorting through them.As I suspected, these bars are attached with mounting tape. I am familiar with the strength of 3M's mounting tape but this mounting tape requires a hair dryer to heat the tape before attaching to the wood. Tsk.Made in China."
2,Didn't work for me,"Nice concept. Easy to install. But my spices keep popping off the clips every time you close the door. Sometimes they even pop off after the door is closed. Most of my jars are glass, so I don't know if the added weight makes a difference (vs plastic jars)? All I know is these didn't work for me. I will get removing them (hope that goes well!) and getting something else."
1,I should have listened to the reviews!,This spice rack was such a great idea. I mounted it on the inside of my pantry doors. Unfortunately within the first day bottles started falling off. It seems to only really hold onto bottles that are small and have a good indention under the lid. One has now even fallen off the door. I'd return it right now if I still could.
1,Bad,"It is not good enough, i tried to put my spice stuff and the... booom ...broke. Consider to pay more but getting good quality."
3,Very simple explanation.....weak excercises!,"Explanations go very smoothly to the extent that somebody who has nothing to do with semi-conductor physics will understand it directly. Nice graphs, neat diagrams, etc.. but the problems are very weak in comparison to other books, such as Sedra & Smith's book (Micro-Electronic circuits). However, the explanations of the latter are on a very advanced level. I recommend Floyd's book for somebody who wants to understand, but not to practice!"
3,"Errors in ""Advanced Problems""","I started using Floyd because it seemed to be at the right level for my students. Especially the weaker students would benefit from it, I hoped. I would rate ""The Art of Electronics"" by Horowitz and Hill a much better book on electronics, but it is too difficult for many. However, I discovered annoying errors in Floyd's ""Advanced Problems"". For example 2-44, which I interpret as designing a clipping circuit for +18 V and -10 V using a single 24 V DC power supply; I don't know how to do it. Or problem 3-39, where a 110 V AC voltage is connected diodes and zeners that could never stand this. Anyway, in Fig. 3-71 it is not reasonable to have 220 Ohm resistors for both the 6.8 V Zener and the 24 V zener. Howcome errors like these can persist in the fourth edition?"
3,Not the best delivery,"The book was the correct item and it arrived in good time. However, it was shipped in a thin plastic bag without any structure or padding. This book is 8.5x11x1.5 inches has nearly 1000 pages and weighs almost 5 pounds. As a result the corners of the cover were crushed and there was a half inch triangular gouge in the front cover. I'd have paid an extra $5.00 for better packaging rather than lose an unknown trade-in value."
4,thoughtful but funny,"At turns thoughtful, and at others funny (so much so that you will laugh aloud), this book is a great read for a parent and a child with a vivid imagination. It is not for realists, but for those who can lose themselves in a good tale."
1,"Terrible Edition, Lovely Story","This is a lovely, fairy-tale-like story. But I had to return this edition (blue hardcover). I could have excused the frequent blurry printing, but not the missing pages! For example, in one section of the book the pages are numbered 111, 83, 113, with page 112 and its contents nowhere to be found. Find a used copy and get the entire story."
4,Good lesson,"As a science teacher I found this a very worthwhile video.It covered the topics we needed to cover in a way the studentscould ""see"" rather than just picture in their mind. Helped thembetter understand the Earth and helped me better ""show"" them"
3,Interesting,A little long for my purposes. I play short videos on motor coaches. This is too long for the short trips I take.
2,low grade HSS blades wear down very very quickly,"I have used Milwaukee sawzall blades in the past and they seem to have gotten worse with what I think is a lower grade of high speed steel. Cutting is much slower and the blades wear out very quickly. I used these blades to shorten 2-3/8"" galvanized steel pipe and it took 2 blades to make 3 cuts through the pipe.No point in buying blades from a USA company if they are not going to produce a quality product and with Milwaukee and Lenox the quality has gone downhill as these companies are absorbed into huge corporate conglomerates."
5,Our daughter LOVES it!,"I highly recommend this book! We're in the process of adopting a baby boy from Russia, and I searched for books that explain adoption to the sibling already at home. This book has been a great way to start to prepare our 3-year-old for a baby sibling who will arrive in a different way. It's about a little girl whose parents are adopting internationally - they travel without the little girl to bring home a baby girl, so the book also deals with separation while parents travel. It never mentions what country the baby is from, and it's easy to substitute ""boy"" as appropriate when reading. Our daughter now ""reads"" the book to herself because she knows it by heart, and tells everyone that she's adopting a baby brother from Russia."
4,iPod shuffle,I have used the iPod shuffle before and I wanted to purchase one. I am happy with the product. It was easy to use thanks to the manual that came with the iPod.
2,charger now an accessory,sold w/out any way to charge or load music. apparently that is now considered an accessory. recently found a charger for a whopping $1.19. would have been happy to pay that or even a little more to have something that was usable upon delivery.
2,Doesn't work,"The product arrived as described, with headphones and in good aesthetic condition. However, when I hooked it up to the computer(windows), it was not recognized. A green light on the iPod indicated that it did in fact work and was on/charging. Maybe it's because the iPod is so old or something else I'm unaware of, but I was thoroughly disappointed that it didn't work as expected. I visited apple's website and tried the suggested troubleshooting but to no avail."
1,Terrible,"It did not work from the start. Went to the Apple site for help, which was very good, but the shuffle did not work after using the help! Aarrrrgh"
4,Happy with my Shuffle.,For my purposes the Ipod Shuffle is great. I love the size and convenience of it. I do not like the earbuds. I can't keep them in my ears. I also wish you could charge it without having to have it plugged into a computer.
4,A Small Dose of Awesomeness,"The ipod shuffle is great! Granted, it's limited in it's features. But, I find that to be part of it's beauty. It's perfect for a subway commute, jogging session, or time at the gym. The fact that there's no screen to tell what song is coming next is kind of nice once you get used to it. It keeps that element of surprise going and is less distracting. I'd recommend this to people who want to casually listen to music, while going about their day."
4,My favorite tax return purchase of '07!,"I've had this little player for just about a year and it has been good to me. Initially, it was mainly for running and working out in the gym but it has replaced my main iPod with just about everything I do. The size can't be beat and I can bring it anywhere and listen to music discreetly. Originally, this was a 3 star review, because of the crappy included earbuds. However, with some equalizer settings and a good pair of headphones (Sennheiser CX 300 B), this nifty gadget cannot be beat. Functionality wise, the clip was a great idea but they left our some sort of wire organizer. To alleviate that miscue I bought this clear mophie case and now it's perfect! Of course, this product is not for everyone. I think if enjoy just music and like not carrying bulky stuff around, this makes perfect sense for you."
2,Dont waste ur money,"I dont think this is worth the cost and u can find better product for this cost.No feature to see which song its playing , no option to move to desired song ( just press next,next..in sequencial and in random u just have to listen whatever is plays), no drag drop facility have to use itunes, itunes tied to specific pc,just 1gb ,etc,etc and i can keep on listing.The two star is given for its compact , sound quality and if you pause and switch off in middle and start again it resumes properly otherwise 1 starI may suggest this for $5-10 not for $45..."
4,Perfect ergonomics flawed slightly by hum,"The ergonomics (clip, size, controls) of the 2nd generation Shuffle put it ahead of its 3rd generation replacement in my view, which is why I grabbed one of these while they were still available new. The only flaw I've noticed is a persistent but not-too-intrusive hum. I use the Shuffle while running so it's not a fatal flaw by any stretch."
3,good quality for the price,"I got the iPod shuffle used and it still works well, no problems. A few little annoyances: 1. you can't choose a specific song without scrolling through them all and the ""random"" function seems to choose the same songs over & over. 2. You have to download itunes to load songs onto it, unlike other MP3 players, with which you can use other programs. 3. It is difficult to add just one or two songs without it erasing everything that is already on the player. 4. You can only charge it when it is plugged into a computer. Despite all of that, for the price, it is a good quality player. Small and easy to carry around, good sound quality, excellent for running/exercising to."
3,It has the clip but falls short everywhere else,"Sound quality is reduced from 1st gen iPod shuffles, but it's still very passable. The big problem with this unit is that it comes with 2 gigs, but you'll never be able to listen to all of it for 2 reasons:1) The playlist is reset after every charge2) The charge doesn't last more than about 3 days (or more like 4 hours)My previous iPod never had this issue, even the Touch got better battery life. If you're going to go for the shuffle, get the 1 gig - the 2 gig is a total waste of cash."
4,Apple iPod shuffle,I bought this item for my wife. If you are are not younger than (64) it is difficult to download music. I found the apple itunes to be a pain in the butt with all their downloads. I do like the item and it is amazing what you can put on such a small product. It was bought for workouts and jogging and it's size is perfect. That is why we bought it.
3,Can't Download Music Files,"Product recieved well packaged and fully intact. Despite several attempts, we have been unable to download music files. Have a trouble desk number, have contacted it, but still no luck on the music download. Next step is to contact trouble desk again and attempt an application download to see if that helps the situation."
4,Small and mobile,"This is my first ipod so I decided not to spend much and it was a poor choice. This ipod is good for songs but if you want to listen to audio books you'll need something bigger.A screen would have been a lot better. I plan to look into getting the Nano 4 so songs will be categorized, there will be more memory, and I can choose what to hear by looking at the screen and pushing play."
2,OK?,"The iPod works fine, but it was advertised as being unused -- it had been used and the old music had not been swiped when I got it. It also took forever to arrive -- about 6 weeks."
5,Great Purchase!!!!,"For the price, the iPod shuffle (2nd Generation)is perfect; actually, it surpassed my expectations. I am out and about all the time and needed something small, inexpensive to listen to my music.I've read some of the other negative reviews and I don't get it. The ear plugs that come with are just fine for my purposes - however, if I'm indoors, I whip out the Bose headset that I purchased a couple of years ago and the sound is amazing. The attachments that can be purchased separately - for car use, plugging into your Bose system - are neat.This ipod is very straight forward and easy to use. On a full charge, the battery lasts a little over four hours - that's the only drawback - battery life could be better - however, it's a quick charge. All in all - 5 Stars."
2,can't figure this Ipod Shuffle out,"I have now purchased TWO of these and cant get them to charge via my USB connection. The ITunes Assistant has NEVER appeared when I plug it in, so I cant set it properly, anyone have any ideas?"
5,Great product,"This Ipod is great, I am so pleased with it, great sound, it holds enough music for a day worth of a long trip and the battery last for long, long time. Not trying to sound like I am getting paid by Apple to say this but this is really a great product, I love it."
5,iPOD Shuffle 2nd Gen,"Great purchase! Ultra light, compact, batteryt lasts very long, and super resistant for beating it at the gym..."
5,Sooo much better then the last one I had,"I got the model shuffle after this one and you can't even organize what order the songs go into! So I returned it and went online and bought this one used, since Apple isn't selling it anymore. My husband has one too, and we both love it. You can put things into whatever order you want, it's one-touch easy to use, and none of the issues from the model before or the model after"
2,the Itel looked stained and had a couple of finger prints on it,"I bought an i pod, from amzon, recently.But i am not vey happy with the product.Ofcourse its working properly,but the packing was not great.There was stains on the box, and inside the box as well.The item was having a smell of a disinfectant.The stains looked like they are from some kind of gum.Altogether the appearence gave me an impression as if it has been used for a couple of months and was packed in adequetly and was shipped in that status.To addd, this is not a complaint, this is my opinion, and i wish amzon would take this positively.I hope to purchase more stuff from amazo, and looking forward to future hoping that they would be in good shape.Sincerly,Preethy jacob"
1,Not worth buying,I only had this product for a year and used it at the gym 3-4 times a week. Only 15-20 songs are downloaded on. One day it just stopped working. The product is rubbish and not worth buying.
1,SHORT lifespan,"I bought the device new and a year later (just after the warranty expired) the battery stopped recharging. If I had been using the device every day this might have almost been excusable, but I used it only occasionally, it was essentially brand new. I'd gotten about 50 hours' worth of listening time in on it before the thing died. I will not be replacing it with another one."
2,Horrible quality,"The first one I bought I loved. It lasted about 1 year and then suddenly started to die as it wouldn't turn off. So I figured I'd buy another one. 3 months later it did the same thing. Sorry, I'm not getting fooled into buying another one. I'll take my chances on something else that doesn't cost nearly as much."
4,"ipod works, good enough for me","the back leaver was slightly bent, but not too bad - it still slides and locks into the arm band. came with usb port and headphones."
5,Seniors love IPODS,"I am a Senior citizen and not familiar with the new electronic gadgetsor computers that are on the markets these days. Not to mention afraidto venture in this direction. Well I decided to step out of the box andjoin a gym, get in shape and get a computer. Then I found out about theApple Ipod shuffle, just what I needed for the gym. Had a little troublefiguring out how to put music on it, but Apple Support Centre helped meand now I can help my other senior friends as they all want an Ipod nowthat they have seen mine. I just love the compact size and the music is clear and it inspires me to walk."
5,Apple iPod shuffle 1gb (2nd Generation) review,I bought 1 iPod shuffle for my 18 year old daughter for her birthday. When I received it in the mail and opened the box to look at it before I wrapped it up for my daughter I thought the iPod was missing. My 16 year old daughter started laughing and picked up and handed me the iPod. I thought it was just the belt clip it was so small!! I joined iTunes so she could download music I told her I wanted to check out the quality of sound man was I blown away with the sound quality. As a matter of fact I am going to buy one for myself the sound is that great. Also the price is right I have a mp3 and the difference between it and the iPod is about the same as compairing an8 Track player against a CD player.DueyP
4,Good Value,"My gripes would be that it plays a little slow and that the bse is not great. Sound quality is not a strongsuit, but for $50...how can it be. I think it is worth the price is the sound quality isnt a dire need"
4,Perfect starter iPod,"I purchased the iPod Shuffle for my 9 year old son. This small, easy to use version of the iPod is perfect as a starter and I even enjoy using it as its small and practical design are ideal for clipping on my clothes for chores in and outside the house.Well made - easy to use - great quality sound."
5,pricey but you get what you pay for,"tough little bugger...mine has a few dents in the outer shell from a year's worth of abuse and still works great. perfect for running, i just clip it to the top of my shirt behind my neck and i have all the music i need to run run run"
3,"Love the product, hate the lifespan","I own a bunch of iPods, and like them all. The shuffle is perhaps my favorite because it is so small and simple. I used it whenever riding my bike, walking to the coffee shop, etc. Sadly, my first shuffle died after 18 months of use. It began acting flakey (only playing 1 song on the playlist over & over) and within a couple of days it was dead. It will charge, but can't play any music. It used to flash yellow ""error"" lights, but it won't flash any lights any more after the initial ""green = power on"" light is displayed.Anyhow, I ordered another because it is an unbeatable companion during 6-hour bicycle rides, but I hope this one lasts at least a couple of years.I give this a 5-star for the product design, 1-star for durability. Average = 3 stars."
1,A Rip OFF!!,You can buy a ipod shuffle for around $48 brand new. They only guarantee the battery for a year and then you can pay $49 plus $6.95 shipping to have it replaced! Buy another brand!
2,"Good player, but with too many limitations","I dislike ipod shuffle when I found this on their web site.Note: iPod shuffle is intended for use with a single computer. You cannot load music from multiple computers or iTunes libraries onto iPod shuffle like you can with other iPods.The itunes software is very difficult to use for old people, very slow to load music, and crashes often in my windows xp."
5,love it!!,"I NEVER thought I'd use this thing as much as I have. Already had the full size Ipod, but was away on a trip and wanted something cheap for the plane. Not only was this perfect for my trip home, it's also become my main Ipod. I use it for working out or even just listening to music around the house.In my opinion, 1GB is enough. I'd never been on a trip long enough to where I got tired of a 1GB playlist."
3,Ipod Shuffle,"I recently purchased the Ipod shuffle, I loaded it with my CD's and so far it has worked well. The only problem so far is the ear buds do not stay in place when I walk. I push them in as far as I dare and they will not stay in place0. I still would recommend the purchase of this item."
4,Happy!!!,First of all the product arrived in record time!I immediately went about downloading my music then I ran out of space and it was then I realized that the memory capacity seem to be less than 1GB and additionally much of the space was taken up with something called other files. After googling I discovered that by restoring the ipod it would free up the space... had to do it twice which meant loading the music again. Hence the 4 stars. But alll in all I'm happy with this ipod it's so easy to carry and perfect for walking/jogging and the . I'll be needing a 4GB soon!
3,iPod Shuffle,"I make full use of my downloaded podcasts, but am extremely annoyed that the shuffle will only play the podcasts in order order of newest to oldest and that it will not recognize the order I set the programs. I have searched the internet for a solution to find out that this is the way the shuffle operates."
2,iPod shuffle x 2,"It would appear most have success with this product. Unfortunately, I didn't. Simply put, I ordered two of them for my family and neither one works. iTunes shows both of them as having corrupted hardware. I am returning both of them to Amazon. I will probably purchase directly from an Apple store or buy an mp3."
5,Bought for my 6 year old Daughter (twin a). Excellent.,You cant go wrong with an iPod.....they are simple and they work. My twins both got one of these because they wanted to be like their older brother.They are psyched!!!! Thats what I am told.
1,Worst player I've ever used,"The shuffle is the perfect size to use while running and that's why I chose it. Unfortunately its a horrible player.It doesn't allow use of a standard mini-USB cable to upload songs. It requires the special base that you will need to tote from location to location to access the player and you have to use iTunes software rather than just simple drag-and-drop. Also finding a song can be a pain - you may have to click and listen, click and listen.... over a hundred times to find your song. I prefer my previous mp3 player that is also very small but allows you to drag and drop, uses a standard mini-USB, doesn't require a special base, doesn't require proprietary software, and has a small back-lit display to help find specific songs and has an FM radio and was cheaper.I can only recommend the shuffle if you like iTunes software and only need to access the player from one single computer where the base is located."
2,Went bust after 2 months,"Not very happy with my Shuffle purchase. The Shuffle stopped working after 2 months, pretty frustrating. The headphones are fine but the battery won't hold a charge. Have had a few other iPods with good experience but not this time."
2,Crap,"I bought this as a replacement to my other shuffle that was accidentally washed. I figured I would purchase the same one because I liked it so much. I got this in the mail and it looked like it was in good shape, but upon use the battery life only lasted about 1.5 hours where my old one would last almost a day without continuous use. Since apple has now put out a new model of the same thing, I recently bought one. These things are tanks otherwise, I use it when I hit the mountains."
3,the perfect gift,I purchased this gift for my 13-year-old and it was perfect. She only has a select portion of songs and she doesn't need a screen to know what they are because she already knows them
4,Had to get this shuffle before there where none left!,"Does everything it is advertised to do. Could not bare to get a new one that had a computer voice talking so rushed to get this before they were all gone.I am glad I did. As far as all the bad reviews on the base I don't see the problems with it. I would imagine if you are careful it will last forever. If not there are loads or aftermarket adapters for next to nothing. I have been using it for the gym and it is fantastic. Sounds great with the supplied headphone but sounds fantastic with my better Shure headphones. The best part is that it converts larger songs down to 128 and that was a feature my large generation ipod doesn't have. I was actually able to fit almost 500 songs on it and trust me, that is more than enough music not to hear the same song for a long while. Anyway I enjoyed going through my library and selecting songs for it. If you can still get one grab it as they are all going fast!"
4,iPod Shuffle,"Great for first time users who don't want to make a big $$ investment. The instructions weren't as clear as they could be and the Apple website isn't much better, but I figured it out by trial and error. Good sound, although the ear buds are not made for a woman's smaller ear. The biggest advantage for this ipod is the built in clip. It's well made and got a good grip."
3,Just right,"the apple ipod is alright, i like the color and the shipping was very fast. It is not for me, it's for my youngest daughter and she enjoy it so much."
1,Good if you want to sync to only 1 computer,"The good: It's small and it's an mp3 player. Perfect for the gym.The bad: Make sure you set this iPod to the computer you want to use and use the most. If you have music libraries that are on various computers, like myself. Then you will need to merge yours into one.You cant even plug this into another computer and listen to the music because it will ask you if you want to erase and reformat. That is total bs.I'm swallowing Apples 10% restocking fee and will be returning this. I'm totally disappointed."
4,Good item,"It was on time and it worked. The only drawback is that it didn't have the dock to charge/sync it, but it was in the description of the item, I guess I missed that part. :("
2,Go ahead and THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY!,THE GOOD SIDE:The smallest and lightest mp3 player available.THE BAD SIDE:1. Ridiculously expensive.2. No radio.3. No screen.4. No equalizer.5. No way to select any options on the player.6. No way to select what song you want to hear.7. You HAVE TO have iTunes installed in order to use this player at all.8. Can only be used with one computer at a time.9. Plug it on a different computer and all your music will be erased.10. Cheap earphones with no covers that will start to deteriorate months later.11. Only 2 play modes: continuous or random.12. Odd docking station that will only work with this player.13. You can't easily make copy of the music saved on this player without special software.THE ALTERNATIVE:Look into Creative Zen Stone Plus. I bought this player for $25 at an electronics store after getting so sick of tired of the lack of features by my shuffle. It has most of the things that iShuffle desperately needs.
1,Stupidly overpriced,"When you consider the Sansa Clip 4GB has twice the storage for the same price, trading the OLED display for an Apple logo makes no sense whatsoever.NOT recommended."
1,Apple ipod shuffle,"Bad service. First of all it WAS NOT an apple ipod shuffle. It was a knock off. I bought it for a gift for my daughter for christmas. I decided to down load music on it so it would be ready. It does not work. It will not do anything when plugged into the computor. The computor does not even recognize that a device is plugged into it. I went back and read the reviews and they are all like the one I am writing now. I tried to contact the sender and he is not responding back. Spend your money on someone elses products. I am red flagging ""johnnybravo 234"" from any future products. I did not even want to give him any star ratings but you have to give at least 1 star."
1,stupid MP3,"I will say people who like this one are Apple lovers or have simple brains.This one is durable and has long lasting battery, but all you can do is listening the musci from the beggining to the end. That's it.I forgot, you can stop and pause music too.If you think this is good because of low price, then YP U3 might be better."
3,low end IPOD,"Not bad for limited functionality but go with a nano or higher. I used this for awhile but it's annoying scrolling threw songs without a screen to see the titles, just basic basic functionality....I accidently wasted mine in a washing machine, the battary will still charge but the IPOD will no longer work obviously. It's built well with it's metal housing so it can take pretty much whatever you can throw at it, but again to basic for me."
5,"Best iPod for workout, lawn work and music festivals","I love the 2nd gen. iPod shuffle! It's especially great when you are working out because it's light, clips on to your clothes and can hold enough music that your workout playlist won't repeat a song for a while. I also always use it when I mow the yard or do pretty much any work outside. The last place I find that this is my iPod of choice is at Bonnaroo, it makes the time between shows go by much faster."
5,Love this little powerhouse.,"I love this tiny 1""X 1 1/2"" iPod! Who would believe something so small could be so wonderful. It is easy to load music off my iTunes library. The sound is incredible. The earphones are hard, not a soft silicone, so I had to buy some smaller, softer ones for my comfort. The original earphones have a great sound though. I imagine over time I may want something w/more memory....but really, 240 songs is a lot and will keep me happy for a long time, I'm sure."
1,Quit working after 4 months,"Quit working after only 4 months! While it comes with a 1-year warranty, you have to pay $30 shipping to get a replacement. Four months is a pathetically short lifespan!"
1,Short Life Span,I bought my wife a second shuffle after the first one failed at around a year. They were so cheap I just got another. The second lasted about ten months. Apple claims a one year warranty. This means they will send you a refurbished replacement. I have just sent the third replacement back as they have all failed. I do not believe there are humans that are concerned about my problem at Apple. Spend a few more dollars and get something that will work.
1,Overrated MP3 player,"I got one of these as a gift and it worked good for a few months. Then Itunes stopped recognizing it. I reset it and reinstalled Itunes, but it didn't help. This is one of the best selling MP3 players and I cannot understand why. It doesn't work with Windows media player only Itunes which is more difficult to use. Bottom line: You can get another player with more memory and an actual display that works with media player for a better price."
4,iPod Shuffle Review,"This product has turned out to live up to it's billing. It is simple to use, it was inexpensive to purchase, it stores am ample library of music, it is tiny and easy to carry around.I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase."
4,Great But Limited!,"The shuffle is great and compact and works well in conjunction with working out. It's always reliable, and seems to hold a charge for quite some time. On the down side though, you can't see what you want to play (there's no screen), and there are also no commands other than on/off. You also can't organize folders - all types of songs go into one long playlist. At 2gb, it holds a lot, so you may have to go through a LOT of songs to get to the one you want. At the price though, it's almost worthing have separate shuffles for different folders."
1,VERY BAD,The product which is shipped does not have resemblance to the image displayed here. It has a black display on top which makes it look really ugly and also it has iron wires propping out which can be cause injury.
1,What good is it,"When I purchased this item I thought it would come with a charging wire or stand. All I received was the ipod. Without the charging wire- I can not charge the unit or conect it to my computer to download itunes. Therefore, it is worthless. I have it in the junk drawer now."
2,Docking Station #3,I loved the concept and have run many miles with this little thing attached to my shirt. I would give it 5 stars if I was not on my third docking station which is again beginning to falter like the previous two. I am out of warranty and don't want to throw good money after bad!!!
1,This player is worthless,"I have purchased three of these 2nd generation shuffles. All three have had the same, exact problem, and none of them work, even though I've only owned them a month. I bought them for myself and my two kids. They worked at first, but upon charging, updating software, and adding songs, they inevitably had some sort of software problem and quit working. I searched Apple's support area, and although I've now spent countless hours trying to fix my particular problem, I have been unable to even find the problem listed on Apple's website, and I am unable to actually speak to a human being about the issue. I will NEVER buy an Apple product again. They have lost me forever."
4,Apple iPod shuffle 1 GB Silver (2nd Generation),They would not mail to an APO address. It took a very long time to get to the stateside address I gave them. The Ipod works great. Price was not competitive.
3,functional once u get past the setup,"So I buy the shuffle because it is wicked small, figure it will have the same simple drag and drop setup that the ipod has. Well, i come to find that loading music is pretty annoying, and slow. Music has to link up to the music loaded on you iTunes library which is annoying if i move some of the music around. when I want to delete music from the device agian, its easier to write down what songs you want to delete because doing it one by one will take far too long.The device works fine, as would be expected from an apple product, but in comparison to what I'm already used to (iPod) the loading and unloading process is slower and as a result annoying. Other than that, once its good to go, its great for working out, small, practically weight less, unobtrusive. If there was another procut out there that was just as small , i would probably not get the ipod, but given that there isnt one as small, ill have to stick to this one for now."
2,Apple ipod 2G,"Hi,I ordered this ipod shuffle 1GB silver(2nd generation) along with an arm band as a gift to one of my friends. The ipod was fine but it had few scratches on it. I was totally shocked after noticing those scratches as this is a new one(not refurbished) and felt embrassed as I already gave this to the person as a gift. She would think I bought her a refurbished ipod to her but it happens to be a new one and paid the price of a new one. Totally disappointed with the product. I ordered for a new product with full price and got a refurb one with scratches on it. Hope this review is helpful."
2,An okay iPod,"This was my very first iPod that I had gotten last year for a gift. I was very pleased with it for a while, until I ran out of space to put all of my music on. There is no expandable memory for this iPod, and that is not a good thing if you are going to shell out 80 dollars for this product. The size of this iPod could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it. I carry a small purse without a lot of stuff in it and I had a hard time finding the thing. The perk to having a smaller iPod is that it doesn't take up a lot of space. One of my other gripes is that there is no screen there to tell you what is playing and how much of the battery you have left. All I have on this is the colors of the flashing little light to give me a rough idea. iTunes is easy enough to use but it can take a long time to load one song onto your iPod. That is why I switched to an iPod classic to give me what I wanted and more."
1,Big mistake,"I was trying to save a little money by buying a ""refurbished"" IPod Shuffle. Obviously, the problems that sent it back in the first place were not solved. The IPod loses both all its charge and all the tunes downloaded into it after it sits for more than 24 hours. If you remember this several hours before you want to use it, these problems can be overcome; a major irritant. I should send it back but that, somehow, doesn't seem worthwile."
1,Why So Much???,"I own one purchased long ago, thought they would be cheap since they are oudated and hold much less then others out. Even more with less compression and sounding better. Am i missing something? This is 1 gig. Per gig thats 4 to 6 times the cost not trying. I'm off to get mine now, Never really inspected it for alien plants or omniatomic gas particles. That would be crazy expensive."
5,Apple iPod Shuffle,"I own 2 of these, and I just bought 2 more for family members. This is a great little unit, and perfect for the gym, or going away on vacation. I wanted something that didn't take up any space or get in my way during exercise and this fits the bill. Holds a decent amount of music and the battery life is better than I thought."
1,What the heck,"Don't get me wrong, I love the ipod shuffle but the one I got from this company came as just the shuffle. I mean seriously, no headphones or charger. Come on!"
2,Small but defective?,"My family has had 3 of these go bad over the past year. Each time we were unable to recover from iTunes ""Back to Factory"" settings. No other way to troubleshoot this particular iPod exists. Yes, it does tell you the error by counting the blinking LED lights, but each time we have not been able to recover it. It is so cheap, that it almost makes it disposable, but 3 bad ones were enough to not recommend it.Perhaps it would be recoverable at the Apple store, but don't feel like waiting for an 2 hours (1 hour drive and 1 hour wait at the store) to get it fixed.Pros : clippable and light. Once you get used to the buttons its easy to navigateCons: Goes ""kaput"" too easy. If you have a few hundred songs on there, it is difficult to find the one you want to hear, sometimes.I've recently tried the Sandisk Sansa Clip, and much prefer it, at 1/2 the $$. Not sure about Sandisk reliability at this point."
5,bamboo circular knitting needles,Love the bamboo circular needles. Yarn slides so smoothly along them.
1,Loud & Startling,"It starts with the cute little birds spinning around, then suddenly there is the loud, motorized whirring and clacking sounds. There is some music hidden under these loud noises, but the other sounds are too loud to enjoy the music. Then comes the demented laughing...not a sound I want my Grandson to copy. This is not a toy I would recommend for a baby or even a toddler.Toy looks cute and if the whirring, clacking, and demented laughing wasn't a part of it, I wouldn't be sending it back. My Grandson won't even see this toy; it's that bad."
4,Lots of Fun!!,My son loves this toy. He is 5 months old and is just fascinated with the sounds and actions of this toy. The music it plays is not your typical baby music. It's a nice change from the ordinary. It makes me happy that it quickly grabs his attention if he is upset.The only thing that I have to say negative is that the little monkey that goes up & down on the side was broken off during shipping but Amazon quickly replaced it with no cost to me.
3,Cute and Loud,"I ordered four of these this year and only one actually worked. This seems to be the norm for Shelcore products. I was quite disappointed that only one actually worked because this toy is visually stimulating. I had hoped to give them to the 9 - 12 month old children in the family but now only one child will be able to enjoy this toy. When you press the top of the toy the animals rotate, the little monkeys climb up and down the tree and there is music and lights to help the production. I think it's a cool toy if you get one that works."
3,Very NOISY!!!,"It's not loud music but, that I don't mind, but when you push don't the top it is a very loud mechanical sound to move the little animals around and clicks loud to move the side ones. You can barely hear the music.We probably won't use this toy much because it is so noisy and ruins the fun of it. I'd rather loud music."
3,Take it or leave it,"We bought 2 of these toys - one for our daughter who was 9 months old & one for our nephew who was 13 month old. When we received them, the little monkey that is supposed to jump on the side was already broken off on one of them. We have had this toy for a year now & the other animals on the side have quit working too, so that part of this toy is obviously not very durable. Also, the button on the top that makes it ""go"" was way too stiff for the kids to push down on their own until they were about 18 months old. This toy is super cute though & the kids do seem to like it, so that is why overall I rated it 3 stars."
3,Spinning Animals,"This was a Christmas gift for my 20 month old daughter. She really enjoys playing with it. Although she has done her best to tear it up, it has been quite durable. Even my four year old plays with it from time to time."
5,Dark Border Book 5,"There's a web site called www.thedarkborder.com where you can register your email address to show interest in Paul's unpublished 5th book ""The King who was of old"". If there is enough interest to justify getting the book published, they will notify you when it's released."
3,not clear enough,"not clear enough to be sure I am doing them correctly, so I probably have to buy a couple of videos"
2,"Information wonderful, quality of pictures poor","The topic is well covered but the actual explanation of exercises (which is the reason most will purchase this book) leave a lot to be desired. It's impossible to see what the exercises are about or how they are to be performed. The pictures are not of human models but of something that looks like a crash test dummy, and the kindle version is so dark you can't see the movements which are very subtle.SInce I only bought the Kindle version I am not sure if the pictures are better in the printed book but without clear visual instruction, a wonderful book is rendered useless. I had to return it and look for another book on Semantics."
5,Somantics,"My Physician told me to get this book , and it is very uplifting, and makes thingsgo into another perspective."
4,A Revelation,"I learned a lot from reading the book, however, I was unable to do the first exercise because one of my problems is in my shoulders. It will be necessary to record the instructions to do the exercises because of the number of steps."
5,Bottom line: get this book,"If you have any structural pain that just won't go away, if you want to better your bodily awareness, and especialy if you are a healthcare professional. It is worth more than its weight in gold. I am a massage therapist, my works effectiveness increased a hundred fold when I learned what this book offers, and my selfcare routine did too."
3,Eh.....,"I wanted to love this..I really did, but I just COULD NOT STAND Laura. I felt that she was playing both Rye and Dan. I disliked her so much that I didnt think she deserved either of them. The writing was pretty good and I thought that the idea for the story was an interesting one, but I just couldnt connect with the characters. One thing that I really did LOVE about this book though were the flashbacks of Laura and Rye discovering eachother and falling in love when they were young...in my opinion, no one can write sexual tension like Lavyrle Spencer. All in all, not bad, but not to die for either.... for a book by Ms Spencer, I thought this was woefully average."
4,"Interesting premise, but falls a bit short","The concept of a husband long suspected lost at sea returning to find his wife married to his best friend is certainly an interesting concept, but ultimately, I feel, this story falls short of its potential. I did not feel sympathy for Laura and felt that her character was weak and did not inspire empathy or compassion. Rye, while I felt sorry and empathized with his situation, was rather annoyed by his lack of respect for the Laura-Dan situation. In the end, I liked Dan best of all and felt that he conducted himself the best given the situation, and actively felt sorry for the man. Not really how you want to end a novel, feeling sorry for a man other than the hero!"
4,I've joined the LaVyrle Spencer Club!,"This is the second book by LaVyrle Spencer that I have read and I must say that I am now hooked on her love stories and on her writing style. Although this book starts off really slow because of its painstakingly detailed decriptions of the setting, her diligence in and ability to describe the history between the characters and the love scenes was much appreciated and gave me a very intimate look into the minds and lives of the characters. This is what made Laura, Rey and Dan real and its also what makes readers feel the emotions that the characters feel throughout the story. That is the test of a truly good writer, and LaVyrle Spencer has passed the test with flying colors!"
2,"The idea sounded very interesting, but","the book went on and on. All the descriptions of the town, weather, ocean, people, etc were too boring and I started to skip paragraphs and pages to get to some kind of action. I couldn't see, what was so special about Laura to have 2 such good men fell in love with her. Seemed to me, she didn't want to make any decision and was waiting for either one of the them to give her an ultimatum. That way, she sort of didn't have to decide for herself. And, actually, Dan was the one who started the legal proceedings, not Laura. Last couple of chapters were easier to read, since there was something going on there.That is the first book I am reading by this author, and I am not sure if I am going to read any of her books again."
3,OH MY!!!!!!!!!!,This book is a real disappointment. I wanted so badly for it to be good but that was not so. The book just moves very slowly. I had to really push myself to keep reading. I hoped that it would get better towards the end but that didn't happen. I have read quite a few of Lavyrle's books and this was the first that I didn't thoroughly enjoy. I recommend all of Spencer's books if you're looking for a good romance. But I only recommend this one if you have a lot of patience! It's a slow one.
4,I enjoyed it...,I really enjoyed this book. When I read the description I was thinking Wow! This is going to be a good one & it sure was. The storyline was just incredible. I just can't imagine. My heart went out to all of them. The first half of this book was awesome but then I felt that it was kind of dragged out. I still enjoyed it but it was just a bit slow for me.This was my 3rd LaVyrle Spencer book & I love her style of writing. I would certainly recommend this book.
4,recent Gita effort is the best available,"Kendra Crossen Burroughs has done a great service with the annotations of Sri Purohit Swami's classic translation of Bhagavad Gita, the Topmost Hindu Sacred Text. Not only is the translation unrivaled in its ability to communicate the universal message of God to humanity,but it is a joy to read and study thanks to clear English and an ability to prune down the additives of the original to a bare minimum. I was also thrilled to see that the annotations selected leaned heavily toward the recorded words of many of the primary exponents of Vedantic and Vaishnava philosophy in the West. The combination of crisp text and exquisite annotations makes this translation a must for all students of the Song of God. One only wishes that it was available as a hardcover. I know my copy will be used often and consulted any time i use another translation for whatever reason."
3,Rembrandt: A Novel,"Historical fiction. Well written description of the times and culture of the Netherlands. Also, provided some insight to significance of his impact on painting. A good read if you enjoy historical fiction and are interested in the social and cultural attitudes of the times."
4,Job well done!,"I always enjoy seeking out new music. This bands music is well thought out and well produced. It gets better with each listen. You can't pidgeon hole their style which is what I like best. It could be rock, indie, or alternative - whatever you want it to be. Take a chance and support a group that will be around for a while."
5,incredible,"i must say, as soon as i heard this cd, i was in shock. it is amazing and the talent is absolutely outstanding. if you havent listened to this cd yet, i HIGHLY reccommend you do. i loved it the second i listened to it. it is truly extraordinary.augustana's new song, all the stars and boulevards, is what drew me into their music. its a big hit. compared to their past music, they have improved greatly. PLEASE, PLEASE go buy this album. you wont regret it."
2,blah,"if you want something with this type of feeling, emotion, blah whatever, just check out Goo Goo Dolls Dizzy up the Girl, or take a walk on the unfamiliar with Taking Back Sunday.. this band just feels too overplayed, I was tired of The Fray 6 months ago thanks..."
3,Good Album,"Most people will come across this album via the single ""Boston"" which is a fantastic song. The rest of the album doesnt have quite the same tempo, although there are some decent laid-back tracks on it. Over all, a good listen when chilling at home or on a long drive. I prefer a band like the Parlotones - they have more hits on each album, but still, Augustana is a decent band."
3,Don't particularly care for this album,"I don't care for any of the songs on this album, but one of my friends thinks it's awesome, so I guess it depends on your taste"
4,Pretty good...,"For a band I've never heard, this CD was pretty good. It has a great easy-going sound to it. I really like ""Boston"" and ""Wasteland."" Overall, I was impressed for a band I've never heard of to be this good. Their voices and style reminded me of Train."
3,Lost Viking,"I got this CD because of the positive reviews I saw put on the site by others. I was a little disappointed. The CD is okay, but it's not as lyrical and melodious as I expected it to be. There is not a single knockout song, and most of the songs are listenable, but repetitive. This band seems to think that repeating the chorus fifteen times will wedge it into your subconscious. It might, but not necessarily in a positive way."
3,"Good music, average singing","Bottom line: similar musical style to the Fray and Snow Patrol, but not nearly as good. Music is actually quite decent, but don't care too much for the singing. Only song that truly stands out is ""Boston"". Would recommend buying songs separately, rather than the entire album."
3,"Not bad for some boys out of Greenville, IL","I stumbled upon these guys while looking up some info on the Austin City Limits Festival. They have been compared in some of their reviews to bands like Coldplay. I haven't heard much else from this group out of the small town of Greenville, IL but what I hear so far I like. They don't really have a unique sound, but they have some good tracks on this album. ""Boston"" is a very good song.Matt Zarnstorff"
3,"Good album, even better live!!!","I bought this album immediately following a show in Virginia Beach, and honestly, I enjoyed the show more that I have the album. This is more due to the show rocking that the album sucking. They're a killer band live - if you get a chance, go check 'em out.ANYWAY - music review here - the album is solid. It didn't just blow me away, and they're not my favorite band, but they're darn good, and definately worth the ten bucks I paid for the cd. The lyrics are unusual and a bit difficult to follow sometimes, but it's a really different style from much of what folks are used to. Not bad, just different.It's really a ""second spin"" cd...it hits you better and better the more you listen to it. Musically, it's like a really good movie. Once it starts, you keep listening to see what happens next. It takes you a little bit of everywhere. And it's fun to sit and list their influences. =)Good listen, sound purchase."
2,Second opinion,"I bought this album for ""Boston"" and was sorely disappointed when I heard the rest of the tracks. The majority of the songs are very well produced, but very poorly written. The lyrics are shallow, meaningless, and repetitive. The music is very unoriginal, with many tracks sounding the same. The only highlight is ""Boston,"" a melodically emotional ballad with decent vocals, nice piano, and lyrics that'd match a ""dawson's creek""-esque tv show."
3,Dated,"Structuralism, post-structuralism, postmodernism, and every other ""post"" have made this work a bit obsolete. Although I sympathize with his desire to let the object ""just be,"" he seems doomed to failure. Don't get me wrong, I love his novels but this bit of theorizing just doesn't hold up, though it gets 3 stars for being thought provoking and straddling the modern and postmodern."
5,Excellent Reference work,"If you have the 'privilege' of being the Family Historian, you probably already know that this assignment is one filled with papers, memorabilia, and a great variety of research projects. Organizing everything from relics to newspaper articles, to your own findings in the local (or distant!) town, village and city court houses and special places of records, is a daunting task.This book helps prepare you for this assignment, and gives you many printed forms and spreadsheets you can print (from the enclosed CD) to organize these many tasks.The book is easy to read, and reference. Specific steps are outlined clearly and concisely. The book opens the door to many other resources available, also.Note: The 2004 version is the first edition, and has been exhausted from the book store's shelves. The cost of this book is steadily climbing. If a 2nd printing is not offered soon, the present supply of good used books will become even more precious!"
3,Not a good choice for a long walk in the rain,"The first few times I used this bright and cheery looking umbrella involved mostly getting to and from the car and places nearby. It opened and closed nicely at the touch of a button and I loved that it had a wider arc than most other collapsible umbrellas.Then came today, when I took it out for a very long walk on a chilly, windless day of steady rain. I'd been outdoors probably less than an hour when I discovered that the top of my head was wet--not just damp, wet--as was the upper back of my raincoat. I reached up and found that the entire inside of the umbrella was as wet as its outside. My companion's umbrella had remained bone dry inside. From now on I will restrict this one to days of drizzle or short hops in and out of the car."
3,required book for class,"Not the best book on the market, but has a comprehensive review of the essential theories and interventions."

1,Not worth the 86 minutes.,"This was probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I could not even watch the whole thing. the plot line, if you can call it that, was so vague it could not be followed. It was more a bad documentary of prostitution than a movie. To top it off, it wasn't even the movie I was looking for. There is a Canadian film by the same name starring Katharine Isabelle that I was looking for and got this piece of trash instead.Don't waste your time and money on this. Darryl Hannah and Dinese Richards should be ashamed of making such a film. They are both quality actors and this was so beneath them."
1,The Life pretty much sucks...a horrible concoction....BLEH!!,"Denise Richards (Valentine, Wild Things, The World Is Not Enough) and Daryl Hannah (Kill Bill Volumes 1 and 2, Splash) are barely even in this damn stupid movie about sex and life. There's a lot of subtitles and a lot of stupid s**t that goes on in this horrible mess of a movie. Richards is studying on sex so she interviews people, who pop up and talk and never stop and they dont go away and this movie never stops. The director must of been on lots of pot when he came up with the ideas..using real people to speak and we have to suffer threw subtitles reading about how these people like to have sex, what positions they like, how to do it properly and so on and so forth. Just cut the malarkey and shut the hell up.....probably one of the worst movies out there so far...a gargantuan BOMBBBBB. Richard and Hannah are wasted"
2,Meditation on prostitution,"Half movie fiction, half documentary, this film is presenting male and female prostitutes and porn stars trying to make a distinction between the two professions. In the midst of prostitutes confessions as to how they got into the oldest trade, are two female characters: young graduate student in anthropology (Denise Richards) and her neighbor failed actress/high class prostitute (Darryl Hannah). As every prostitute has a story on what got them into a trade, so do these two major characters. While one is already a high class prostitute, the other is being carefully guided into becoming one. Interesting meditation on how people get into the situations like these and why they get stuck in there."
3,INTERESTING DOCUMENTARY: AWFUL DRAMA,"What ""THE LIFE"" is, is a very frank discussion of world wide prostitution. Some how someone got the rather ""bad"" idea of framing the DOCUMENTARY with a series Dramatic renactment of the DOCUMENTARY using ""bankable"" english speaking stars (Daryl Hannah, Denise Richards, Joaquim de Almeeida). While the acting is ok, you feel teased if not manipulated and this tends to take away from the DOCUMENTARY. In style it will remind you of ""Sex, Lies and Video Tape"". I will add there is little in this DOCU/DRAMA that could not have played with a ""R"" rating. Neither Hannah or Richards reveal anything we haven't seen before."
1,Is there a point to this movie?,"Every store should have a DVD shredder for movies that suck. Rental stores should offer refund upon return of this movie and immediately throw it away. Adding Darryl Hannah and Denise Richards to an already horrible story line just to sell DVDs is a disgrace. Trying to do 80's style cinematography to add artistry and color just made this movie suck more. Maybe the book version tells a different story if there is one. Save your time, money and eyesight by avoiding this storyless video."
4,Don't be fooled by bad reviews!,"First off, this isn't a showcase for Daryl or Denise (although they are great in their parts) but it is a showcase for prostitutes and does a good job of providing insight into their lives. Both male and female prostitutes are shown, just to be fair, as well as their customers. That said, the scenes with Denise and Daryl are worth the price of the DVD. Denise Richards is sexy enough in a still photo and sexier still in her scene with the a film producer. Don't expect to see Daryl or Denise in the nude. It doesn't happen. There is plenty of nudity though. The DVD is technically well done also. See it if you like documentaries and want to learn a bit about the seamier side of life."
1,A complete waste of time,"My objection was the implication that the ""stars"" played a part in the film. I felt that the picture was completely deceptive. Ms Richards and Ms Hanna had less than 15 minutes (maybe a little more but not much and possible even less) and were clearly there to fool the viewer. It was an interesting documentary about prostitution and it might have been an interesting and revealing film if the the stars had been left out and it was done only as a documentary."
4,Confused At First,"I was confused when I opened it--weren't there supposed to be two necklaces? But then I realized that the metal was thin, and someone told me that my best friend and I were supposed to break it together. Sadly, I had already come up with the idea to break it myself, and my best friend is in Alabama, and I'm not. I told her I was going to send her the other half, and I am, as soon as I get an envelope. It made her very happy to hear that it came in the mail from Amazon. However, it is much smaller than it looks. I thought it would be the size of a quarter, but it's more like a penny. But otherwise, it's pretty cool and easy to put it on a necklace, or, in my case, a bracelet."
3,Different than the picture,It is very small and is more of a bright silver color rather than what is shown by the seller. Giving it to my friend for her birthday before she leaves to study abroad. Hopefully it will hold up and be what I intend it to.
1,Outdated touchy-feely,"I'm aghast that this is still around after all this time. It was out-of-date when it was produced and it still is.Possibly the only value this item has is for its historical interest of 1970s era self-help and 1960s era holistic psychobabble that was the forerunner of the 1980s ""inner"" malarkey that passed for socio-communication theory.No author should still be making money on something like this."
1,How can someone sill be making hay on this?,"Apparently this thing is still in print.As aholdover from the touchy-feely 70s exercises in bad Interpersonal Communication classes, this might be valuable historically to see how far the discipline of communication has come. Keep in mind, this type of thinking precedes all the 80s ""inner"" thinking. Remember that?Still, the author is making hay on this. Don't you be dumb enough to buy it or the other twaddle Elsea has inflicted on us."
5,Lovely Prose.,"Ok, first things first--I heard about this book from my husband, who said he knew the author from work (Army) and he found out that he wrote this book.I have to say, especially if the author reads this review, this is an amazing book. I have a sort of connection with Lavender. There was one part, especially, where she is described wearing a long black skirt wit slits on the side, with the long boots, and Gothic top, and that is an outfit that I've always wanted to own, but unfortunately couldn't find the exact skirt anywhere. I feel her loneliness sometimes, and that is something I can relate too.I always love the ""Gothic"" feel and this book does well with it. The writing style, gorgeous! If the author happens to see this review please contact me here on Amazon. Thanks for writing such a lovely book."
1,forget it,"The reason the previous reviewer could not get the built in memory to work is almost certainly that there is no built in memory. Or at least, there isn't any in the unit I received. Not 128 mb, not any mb. So don't buy this thing unless you also buy a memory card for it."
4,A great example of early Art Lande,"Don't listen to that BS about being unfashionable from the otherreview that comes on when to look at this disk. This is a deep album...nothing ""unfashionable"" about that! This is adventurous writing, impeccable ECM production values, and worth the rather high price of admission. A strong offering from the under-rated and under-recorded Art Lande, who should be recognized for what he is:a national treasure."
5,Almost Unknown Classic,"Rubisa Patrol is one of my favorite bands that no one has heard of. While this record is great, with vintage playing by Mark Isham, Art Lande, and company, it's only a hint of what they'd do on their next record, ""Desert Marauders"". Sadly, that one has never come out on CD, and is rare as chicken teeth.Highly recommended."
2,Too trite to be useful,"Part of the blurb on the back of this book states, ""expectant fathers will discover the joys and expectations God has for those who trust in Him."" But it contains precious few insights of a spiritual nature, and the advice it does contain doesn't go far beyond the obvious. There simply isn't much meat here for men expecting their first child. There has got to be a book aimed at the expectant father who is a Christian which is better than this. A big disappointment."
4,"Good, But Not For The Casual Reader","For planetary astronomy fans, the book is great: chock full of pictures and engineering detail. (The slipcover is also lovely -- I wish I had it as a poster!) The writing is workmanlike and shows that the author's first language is not English, but it does the job. For the casual reader, though, the technical detail may be too much.One gripe: the paper is a glossy bond that smudges and holds fingerprints something awful. This would have been fine for the photo pages, but *all* the pages are like that.All in all, a good book and a much-needed addition to any space-lover's bookshelf."
5,"Clever, kooky, high-energy pseudo-French indierock","If the Bay City Rollers had been French instead of Scottish, and fell into the thrall of some dadaist garage rock scene run by Esperanto cultists... Well, they might have sounded a bit like this gleefully tounge-in-cheek ""French"" rock band from Los Angeles, who giddily skip from rock genre to rock genre as easily and breezily as they slide between languages. Cracking jokes in pidgin French, broken English, and whatever random syllables seem to be laying around at hand, these folks make no sense, but they sure have fun. The crunchier guitar riffs may be a little hard-rocking for your average frog-pop fans, but folks who liked April March's collaborations with The Makers may find kindred spirits here. I haven't seen them live, but I imagine they are a lot of fun."
3,"slick, smooth, and boring","This is good, that is, if you like slick as glass ""smooth jazz"". I personally despise the genre. I was wanting something a bit more incendiary. Especially hate the disco number."
4,Another Great Jarrow Product,"I've been using Jarrow's MSM 1000 powder for more than 5 years. Obviously, I think it is a great product or I wouldn't be using it. I had major orthopaedic surgery last Spring and recuperated quickly, I did a number of natural things including Essential Oils and Laser but I am confident that it quickened my healing process.I have used the tablets and since my stomach is touchy, I personally prefer the powder but I don't hesitate to recommend this Jarrow product.I did get a sample of this through the Vine Program but it in no one influenced my review in any manner. I believe very strongly in Jarrow products over all, see my other reviews."
1,A complete waste of time and money,"This is probably a good example of how dangerous online shopping may sometimes be. I would never would have bought this book, had I had the chance to glimpse at it in a real store. So far this is my worst online purchase. Here are the reasons. It's not really a book - it's a collection of dim-witted aphorisms related to men's fashion. There is an average of 4 such phrases per page (""The Hawaiian shirt: no"" or ""Expensive shampoo smells really good"") x 150 pages = 600 common sense proverbs in all. Basically this book is good for men who have absolutely no clue about fashion (Ricki Lake makeover candidates), as the first stepping stone. If you already know that socks are a must and that sneakers don't go with suits, you will be as disappointed as I am now."
4,Style AND wit!,"What makes this little book so good--and so original--is its voice and style and humor, which are perfectly in keeping with Esquire magazine's 70-something year history of offering sound advice to real American men. It's as much a collection of humorous axioms as it is a guide to dressing, which makes the topic easily and enjoyably digestible--and you have to love Pedro the bulldog that models the clothes. Yes, as some reviewers have noted, it's a quick read (wait: that's bad?), but the shelves are already sagging with self-important books that purport to be encylopedic guides to fashion, and how many men have time to sit down and read an encyclopedia? Amazon's page clearly indicates this book's compact size and modest price--I mean, how big a book do you want for ten bucks?. I found it an absolute hoot, and I gave it to both of my brothers for Christmas--who, in turn, bought it for their college-age friends. Two thumbs up from San Fran. More Pedro!"
1,Save your money,"Sorry, this isn't a very good book at all. It is just a few lines and paragraphs strung together. Some of the information is OK but some just reflects an attitude and not real style. Better to get Clothes and the Man or Dressing the Man. Those are great books about dressing and style."
2,Not What I Expected...,"I made the mistake of ordering seven of these books, for myself and my six groomsmen, without reading it first myself. It's not all that bad, it's just more ""tounge-in-cheek"" than it is serious. Not really what I was expecting."
2,ESQUIRE'S Things A Man Should Know About Style,"I think this book is puffery at its best. Some of the advice is very pedestrian and even a bit cocky (in an effort to be amusing). Most men who have any real style at all -- or know anything about clothes -- will find it boring. Speaking of boring, has anyone seen the suits that are featured these days in ESQUIRE? Tight-fitting rigs that show a big belt buckle, too many buttons, tight legs, and probably being worn by some young guy with a three-day growth. Experts on style? There are far better books on classical, quality dressing than this mediocre, eight-year-old rhubarb. Save your money."
5,Can't beat the value,"What an awesome product. I use these with a my sub. The clarity is amazing when I listen to Radiohead and the crunch for my heavy metal sounds great too. Nice highs, mids and lows. Then I've got my sub for my extreme lows. My setup is worth about $300. $100 for the Fluance bookshelf speaker and 200 for my 12 inch sub and it sounds just as good as my dad's high end B&H system worth thousands."
5,Excellent contemporary bluegrass,"This record is one of the most professional and exciting bluegrass productions I've come across in years.It bears an extra quality stamp: it was produced by Ricky Skaggs,who also plays additional guitars and banjo. The disc offers a wealth of haunting melodies, impassionate yet precise playing and heartfelt lyrics. The harmony singing and the fiery fiddle-playing throughout are worth the price of the whole album. A very varied record with changes of pace and of musical textures. The first song (Heart Like A Roadsign) and the fourth one (With a Memory Like Mine) are two of the most powerful traditional songs recorded in recent years. The lyrics are well worth listening to carefully. With their themes of patriotism, family values and Christian faith they express convictions very close to Ricky Skaggs's own, a very American view of the world that I as a foreigner (a European) admire very much."
5,One word---Fabulous!,From the first note this CD is hard driving. Not a track we didn't like. This is a very talented bunch of musicians and should be seen live if at all possible.
2,Country not bluegrass,"I saw these guys live in Telluride this summer (2005), and they were amazing. So I bought the CD, and it is vastly different from what I heard. In my opinion, the songs on this CD are closer to country than real bluegrass. I gave the CD to a friend who also loved their Telluride set, and he just gave it back to me without even listening to the whole thing. Don't bother with this one if you are looking for bluegrass!"
4,This is my third MULE,"This is my third MULE and I think it's the best one of the batch. At first, I wasn't sure I liked the way the zippered pockets were laid out, since they were different than what I was used to. Normally you don't start out on a tour with new equipment, but I took off across Florida last weekend and found it much better than my old MULE in almost all respects. I don't think it's as easy to put the bladder in, but that might be because I haven't done it enough times. It must be better insulated than the old ones, because I found myself running out of water about 45 miles into the ride. When I checked the bladder, all of the water was gone, but about half the ice hadn't melted. In the old MULE, the ice would have turned to water by that point. The water resistant MP3 player pocket is a nice touch for either a player (used with an external speaker, not earbuds) or a cell phone. Well worth the money. I'll be ready for MULE IV in two or three years."
5,Camelbak review,"exactly what i wanted, i has the perfect amount of room for stuff youd want to bring for a day trip in the outdoors. the hydration system works well and seems to be very high quality, no leaks and it keep the water cold for hours. only complaint is that the water in the tube gets warm but thats pretty unavoidable no matter what. great pack and well worth the price"
5,Name Brand Is Where Its At - Camelbak!,"OK, you could get a $20 Hydration Pack from Wal-Mart but why? I picked up my Camelbak M.U.L.E for $60 ($25 cheaper than MSRP). Chalk one up for Amazon!The M.U.L.E is a great all around pack the holds 3 liters of water. You may think that 3 liters of water is too much, it will add extra weight, etc. Good news is you don't have to fill it up all the way all the time! I have used the pack for mountain biking, 4 wheeling and hiking so far and see endless possibilities. The pack is very customizable between the straps, clips and pockets. Pockets are very generous in size but do not add much extra size and weight to the pack. It looks big in the picture but is not that bad. The pictures show the pack totally stuffed with supplies but if you are just using it for water, spare bike tube, a multitool and a hat, it sits very flat on the back. The water reservoir is very tough and is warrantied for life.Please don't go generic! Trust Camelbak."
5,The Shame Borne in Silence,"I think that every Jewish man and woman would benefit from reading this book. Abraham Twerski is a highly educated psychiatrist/rabbi, who has excellent thoughts about this unfortunate universal problem. He has insightful answers that are helpful no matter whether the reader is orthodox, conservative or reform. He can only raise the consciousness level of all of us, and offer suggestions to both the victim and the perpetrator of spousal abuse."
3,Missing top mic holder,"This Microphone stand does NOT include a mic holder. I don't quite understand why they say it fits a Rock Band mic, when their stand doesn't come with the piece that actually holds a mic. You'll need to buy a mic holder separately if you get this Euroboom Mic Stand. Besides that, the quality of the actual stand seems to be good."
2,Not the quality I expected,"I bought this item expecting to get something of better quality than I did. The hose, the valve and the blow gun were on the cheap side. The cylinder itself seems to be the only component that had any real lasting quality of materials in it. Whatever standards this AC System Flush Kit was built to, must have been very minimal. I would't recommend purchasing this kit."
3,Defective and not quite what I needed,"This is a tough one to review. On the one hand the item was defective and caused kernal panics, some odd interferences with the monitor and several other problems. Plus it wasn't compatible with the Firebox that I intended it for. However, neither is really the fault of the card per se. Customer service was incredible and helped me trouble shoot until we figured out it was a defective card. And Firebox isn't compatible with A) cards that use non-TI chips and B) are combo firewire/usb cards. As I said, not fault of card.I returned the defective card to Amazon and purchased another Sonnet card - one that has only Firewire (and TI chip). So far so good...Would recommend the product as I don't believe defective cards are too prevalent (and I always have one element go haywire when I buy a new system, so this was the jinxed item)"
4,"Superb, swinging tunes and lyrics withstand many repetitions","We like this album as much as our 5 year old does. The tunes are catchy, with a lot of jazzy swing and other influences. I think the lyrics are even better, often containing hidden gems for the parents. Jessica's voice is rich and comfortable. We like Nora's Room just as much. Great stuff - she should be more famous as a children's artist."
5,Best Album from the best children's artist,"All of Jessica Harper's albums are wonderful. Catchy, funny, easy to sing, and musically rich enough for an adult. This album is the best, I feel. My daughter and I sing ""I saw some wings from the angel store"" all the time. So many phrases from these songs become catch-phrases around our house and the root for lots of humor and fun. Ms. Harper has a wonderful, rich alto voice which is fun to sing with and there are lots of harmonies in all the songs. In fact, listening to these albums helped refine my musical ear with regard to harmony and made it easier for me to sing in the church choir. This is music you will love and your kids will love."
5,Kids and parents can enjoy,We love this for car rides. We can all agree on it and it is wonderfully upbeat. We give it for gifts and it is always appreciated.
4,"Superb Research, Stilted Prose","Dumas Malone (1892-1986) devoted his academic career to studying Thomas Jefferson, and this superbly researched volume reflects that lifelong scholarship. This book is one in a six-part series examining the life of our third President. I read this book for a college class and immediately grasped the unending pressures that President Jefferson faced in his second term. Malone examines the decision-making options available to Jefferson, usually (and perhaps too often) supporting the eventual route that the President decided upon. This volume's research and analysis is worthy of five stars, not to mention the 1975 Pulitzer Prize the series captured. Unfortunately, Malone's stilted prose - the weakness of most academic historians - produces a rather laborious read. Thus, four stars overall."
3,Parts of Two Books,"While I enjoy the Lydia Chin and Bill Smith series and think that each book has its own feel depending on whose point of view that book is told from, I found Stone Quarry an oddity in the series. It seems to be Bill Smith's book: he's at his uncle's cabin in upstate New York and is asked by an old friend to investigate what might be a burglary. This causes a run-in with a cop who hates Smith. A body turns up. More problems -- and it's clear that more than a burglary is involved. Eventually Lydia Chin arrives, but by the time she does, it feels like an intrusion: as if the novel was going in one direction with Smith, but then the author decided she needed to bring Chin into the picture. The story and movement of the book felt disjointed to me, as if it were parts of two different books put together. But, if you're a Chin/Smith fan, and if you like small-town or small-community settings, this is worth reading."
2,Love Them!,Those Mini- samiches are some good eatin! IYou don't even need to have a partay to enjoy these tasty treats! I have been known to eat 7 or 8 a day!
5,Very satifsfied :),The faster shipping wasn't too much more than the standard and I got the book sooner than expected. It was in very good condition. I'm very happy with my purchase! :)
5,LIFEHOUSE IS ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!!,"this is a great CD...probably one of the best i have! Jason has such a great voice (and not to mention he's way hot too!) My most favorite songs on here are ""Hanging By A Moment"", ""Sick Cycle Carousel"", ""Somewhere In Between"", and ""Everything"" and all the others are great too. I'm definitely hooked!!!"
5,The best CD i've ever heard,"This is the best CD ever!! I had heard a couple of the songs before I bought the CD but there is probably only 2 songs on the whole CD that I dislike. I was lucky enough to see Lifehouse in concert and let me just say JASON IS SO HOT!! They performed Hanging by a Moment, Quasimodo, Cling and Clatter, Sick Cycle Carousel. I was never a fan of Cling and Clatter but after they performed it, it became my favorite song. I really like lifehouse b/c they are a good mix of songs between slower, softer songs and harder songs. I recommend this CD!!"
5,Buy this CD!!,"Thank God for Amazon.com ...I live in South Africa and I haven't been able to find a copy of No name Face in any of the major CD Stores here.Anyway this CD Rocks.The depth and feeling of the lyrics and the beauty of the music is astounding given the(relatively)young age of their singer/songwriter Jason Wade.I love all the songs and this is one of the few CDs in my collection that I can listen to all the way through without skipping the 'not so good ones'.But my faves definitely are:Simon,Sick Cycle Carousel,Hanging by a Moment,Everything and the totally awesome and infinitely brilliant Breathing.This CD has its quiet and totally intense moments.Buy it! U won' be dissapointed.Hanging By a Moment is only the beginning -they get better."
5,"Amazing, and oh so beautiful","Lifehouse, with their debut album 'No Name Face', have proven that they have got bags and bags of talent. So much talent in fact, that it's hard to imagine these guys ever being 'No name Faces' for much longer. Living in the UK has it's drawbacks (oh yea!), for a start we miss out on music such as this, sadly we're going through a sort of preteen pop phase. I would thoroughly recommend this CD to anyone who loves rock. I would even go as far to say that it is one of the last decades best produced cds. Not one single track do I not enjoy. Who couldn't love ""Hanging by a Moment""? The thing is, I can relate to what this guy says in his songs - that in my book is what real music is all about.Enjoy!"
4,GOOD CD!!!,"Lifehouse has really got a great release here. A CD that should have left the competition in 2000 way behind. With tracks such as ""Hanging By a Moment"", ""Simon"", ""Breathing"", and ""Unknown"", it is 2000's best CD. The only thing that keeps this CD from a 5-star rating is that it's a bit too calm for my tastes."
5,"""Hanging by a moment"" leads you to ""everything""","Like many it was ""Hanging by a moment"" that caused me to buy the debut cd from Lifehouse, but I was quick to find out that wasn't even the best song on the cd. In my opinon that distinction would go to ""Everything"" the album's closer. What a closer it is! The song builds and builds until exploding into a desperate declaration of ""You're all I want, You're all I need, You're everything, everything..."" Masterpiece. Other highlights for me are ""Sick cycle carousel"", ""Unknown"", ""Trying"" and ""Breathing"" (which incidentally is one of only 3 songs I've ever braved the karaoke machine for. If you haven't already, get it! If you did but gave up on it too quickly, get it again."
5,Gotta Love em!,"I have been a lifehouse fan now since there debut album came out, Every song on there first album is amazing and so true to life, the lyrics are great, there inspiring, and anyone who has been in a rough spot in life and wanted to get back up can relate so well to there music, If i could id put a personal Guarentee that You would never get sick of this album if you purchased it. i havent over 3 years now. listen to it everyday from start to finish. gotta love it!"
5,"A Song For Every ""Moment""","Wow. That's all I could say after hearing ""Hanging by a Moment"" on the radio for the first time. Once in awhile you find a song that, when you hear it, even for the first time, it gives you chills. I've listened to this song hundreds of times, and it still gives me chills. That's when you know it's REALLY good. It's not so much the lyrics of the song, but the way it's sung. Jason Wade has an incredibly soulful, almost heartbreaking voice that's hits every nerve. The rest of the songs on the CD are also awesome, some of my personal favorites being ""Breathing"" and ""Only One,"" although, they are hard to compare with ""Hanging by a Moment."" Listen to this CD while driving down the highway, in the summer, windows down, and sun setting. You'll get the feeling..."
5,The Absolute Best,"This CD is my favorite our of all the many CD's i own. I can't say enough good things about it to express how much i love it! I bought it in July and throughout that month, everyday, that was the only CD i listened to. Even now in November, I am still listening to it constantly because whenever I have time to listen to music, I will always listen to this disc countless of times before I move onto a next. The lead singers voice is amazing and the back-up music is great with lots of variation. You are able to emotionally feel things through their music and their music is REAL, unlike most of the pre-fabricated music out there. It's not ""pop"" or a fad that's going to come and go, their music is timeless and I will always love this disc!"
4,"CD I initially overlooked, but now am glad I bought","Jumping on the bandwagon with everyone else, I bought this CD for ""Hanging By a Moment"" and more or less ignored most of it. Then I listened to it again just a week ago. This is a really good CD. ""Sick Cycle Carosel"" is a great lead off track. Beyond that, ""Everything"" is probably my favorite track on the album. It's just a really good song. Worth picking up, definately, even if you're sick of ""Hanging by a Moment."""
5,Unique group,"The moment I bought this CD, I couldn't stop listening to it. Having never heard any other Lifehouse songs besides Hanging by a Moment, I was greatly impressed by what the CD had to offer. What impresses me the most is Jason Wade's wonderful voice, which is especially brought out in Simon. The great thing about this CD is that it has a mix of both soft, mellow songs and upbeat, harder songs. I would have to say that of all the songs on the CD Breathing, Everything (once played in an episode of Roswell), and Simon would have to be my favorites. They are such a great band and No Name Face is a great first album for Lifehouse. I really hope to hear more from them sometime soon. For those of you who love Lifehouse too, check out Jason Wade's song ""You Belong to Me"" on the Shrek soundtrack. That's all I have to say except that this is a great CD to buy and you won't regret it."
4,Why do people hate it?,"I was amazed by the bad reviews this got. First of all, top 40 radio? I don't think so. They are not computerized and pop. They don't dance and they write the music. Just because HANGING BY A MOMENT did hit top 40 radio, doesn't mean they were an automatic overnight success and sell outs. The songs actually have meanings. I'd recommend it for anyone who likes guitars or needs a break from Britney Spears. ;DBut if you need convincing download ""Breathing"" or ""Simon""Outstanding tracks."
5,One Of The Best Cd's EVER!!!!,"This cd is sooooo awesome. I got it as soon as I started to hear Hanging By A Moment on the radio. I thought that it was one of the coolest songs I had ever heard. Most of the time you buy a cd and you end up with maybe one other good song on the cd, but to my pleasant surprise, all the other songs were just as good as Hanging By A Moment. Their new single Sick Cycle Carousel should be just as good as Hanging By A Moment. My personal favorite song on the cd besides Hanging By A Moment would have to be Someone Else's Song. Don't be afraid to buy this cd. You will definately find out that your money was well spent!"
5,Lifehouse- No Name Face,Absolutely amazing. I first heard this group back in December of 2000. The minute I heard the song I fell in love with them. I still listen to this CD on a regular everyday basis and can't wait for their next CD to come out.
5,No Name Face,This is a must have disc for anyone that likes plain old rock and roll with a good messege.These guys have a very strong future.I look forward to thier next disc.They also put on a great show!!!
5,A long way from FKA,"Jason first started playing at our youth group a few years ago, and we always knew he, Diff and Sergio had amazing potential, we just never guessed how much. With the advent of their new CD, No Name Face, they have gone from being a little band playing at some youth group in Malibu, to a modern rock sensation. Although we don't see much of what is now Lifehouse (previously Blyss), we still love their music and will support them to the very end. Guys, keep up the good work-- God is on your side."
5,O My Goodness Life house is AMAZING!!!!!,WOW WOW WOW WOW I LOVE THIS CD! I don't think that this cd could get any better! Jasons voice is amazing! Guitars are great! Drums Wonderful! I couldn't say anything but good things about Lifehouse. This CD is the perfect blend of pop rock and alternitive! I LOVE this CD! Lifehouse Rocks!
3,A different sound,"Well, I really liked the song Hanging by a Moment. I'm a HUGE Pearl Jam and Creed fan. When I heard that song I fealt that Lifehouse would be stars. I bought the cd about two weeks ago and so far I haven't really been impressed. There are a few decent songs on the cd but nothing that really stands out. Wade, the lead singer has an excellent voice but I find that the rest of the band musically lacks. A lot of the songs sound very similar and I get somewhat bored with it after listening for a little while. I'm sorry to say it but I think that Lifehouse is just another one hit wonder."
4,Freshmen Album Delivers Unique Taste,"The new band Lifehouse delivers unique taste to rock. The increasingly popular single ""Hanging by a Moment"" is a love song written in a rock way. It's catchy lyrics and beat are what will make it a Classic someday. Other great songs on the album include Quasimodo which is one of the heavier songs on the album. All of the songs intertwine a good combination of singing and rock. Look to hear lots from this band in the future."
5,You should buy this CD!,"This CD is amazing! I got this CD a week before I went to Japan back in May 2001. This CD had awesome songs throughout the entire CD. My personal favorite is ""everything"" the last song. It reminds of Japan. I have not gotten sick of it once since I first got it, it's now been 5 months since I've had it and I'm still listening to it. Buy this CD - it'll do you good."
5,Lighthouse is FABULOUS!,"So, I bought this CD on a whim and am so excited....it is GREAT! The entire CD is fabulous! I give it a total 5+ (Lighthouse deserves more than just 5 stars!). Try it out! I have recommended to all my friends and they love it too! : )"
5,One of the first,"What can I say I'm a long time fan. I was in virgin records the other day when my friend asked me to listen to this song. I loved it (hanging by a moment). It wasn't till I listened to track 3 that I realized who they were, ""this is Blyss"" I yelled. They are amazing and Jason is a natural writer/singer. It seems he can't go wrong. I bought the Blyss CD 2 years ago and have always felt they had huge potential. I think its a crime that its taken this long. They have unique perspective lyrically and musically. A few of the Blyss songs are on the No name face album but I have to tell you their best song ever ""Reaching"" is only on the Blyss CD. This boy can write and this boy can sing. Those two in combination tells you they're not going away. If you ever see the Blyss ""Diff's lucky Day"" album grab it. Its a piece of history. I love all of their songs but I really like Quasimodo."
4,"Good, but not original","I bought this album having only heard ""Hanging By a Moment"". Unless you are deaf, I don't see how you couldn't like that song. It has great lyrics, catchy hook, everything you could ask for in a song. Well, there is nothing else on this album even close to being as good. If I had to pick my second favorite song, I guess it would be their new single ""Breathing"". ""Somebody Else's Song"" is also OK. The main reason I gave this album 4 stars instead of 5 is becasue even though this CD is pretty good, it sounds like a lot of other stuff I've heard before."
3,Mumble-Rock Insta-Stars,"And No - - I'm not saying that this is good or bad - - obviously LIFEHOUSE has talent, they snagged one of the few 'great' rock/pop band names, they snagged a record deal, the album/CD is thouroughly enjoyable and can be oddly hard to resist though in my humble opinion 'Stanley Climbfall' is a more 'sincere' albumn/CD/compillation-etc than this outing. Time will always be the measure of a group seemingly intent on producing music together - - in years to come 'No Name Face' might become that 'favorite mememnto' of a veteran band's earliest years or a sad reminder of potential thrown away by circumstance or fate. Life's greatest joy is getting to wait for the answer. Eagerly anticipating 'LifeHouse's next efforts both in music and in image via 'video' / DVD."
5,The Best CD I've bought in a long time:,"This CD is awesome. It's one of the few CDs that I've ever purchased where I liked...I mean loved every song on the album! All the songs are not only good, but they have a lot of meaning behind them and I think that's another plus to the album. Every member of the band is extremely talented. Jason, the lead singer is even responsible for writing the entire album, which says a lot about their talent. It also doesn't hurt that Jason is gorgeous! Buy it - you won't be disappointed. This is one album that is worth every penny!"
5,IT'S UNBELIEVEABLE!,"I bought this album because I love the song""Hanging By A Moment"".But after I hard the whole music of the album,I was deeply touched by all the songs,they really touched my heart.So I want to recommend this album....it's worth buying!!"
2,A Different Opinion,"I'm a really big Lifehouse fan, but I don't see how this album deserves all the 5 star ratings. It's got a couple of good songs, but the rest are pretty boring. If you like slow, meandering songs then this album is quite nice. Don't listen to it while driving, you might fall asleep."
4,Addictive...,"As with the rest of the people, the lead single ""Hanging By A Moment"" caught my attention, but I didnt consider buying the album until I overheard some of the tracks in my friend's room.This is an absolutely stunning album. The whole album has such a fresh and original sound. A lot of the riffs are really original, and the whole feeling is very soulful. The singer's voice is absolutely brilliant - so husky...The only downfall is the lyrics. When I first heard the lead single, I thought the lyrics were brilliant. But then when I heard the album, all the lyrics are really similar and really shallow. He uses a lot of the same words over and over. If they teamed up with Counting Crows...."
3,Listen Before You Buy,"I think No Name Face is an ok outing. I was really misled by the single Hanging By A Moment and by other reviews that likened Lifehouse to Creed and Matchbox 20. Hanging By A Moment is one of only a couple of up tempo songs and I don't think they sound like either of the other bands. The single is great and so is the song Sick Cycle Carousel. From there on, a box of No Doze and a few stiff shots of espresso would be a good idea. These guys sound like they may be talented, but this disc is just way to slow. A lot of the songs sound like they are going to do something and then just fizzle and are ultimately forgettale. Overall, I would highly recommend listening to as much of this as you can before purchasing. This is a disc that you will either really like or probably never listen to again. I would not recommend listening to this while you are driving, it is very sleep inducing."
5,pretty darn good,It's a great cd but a lot of their music and lyrics sound all the same. But other than that I love it.
5,Wow,"I have a feeling every other reviewer here is about 15 years old and they're all raving about this record. So, with a wink, I'll give it a perfect 5 stars...mostly for convincing a bunch of 15 year olds that it is the most perfect album ever. Which is what they label was trying to do.BTW, great, state-of-the-art production on the album. Clearly the producer knew what he/she was doing."
5,Simply Awesome,"I've had this album for a long time. I listened to it so much, that I had to purchase a new CD recently.This is simply the best of Lifehouse (now that they have 3 albums out). The lyrics are magical. ""Hanging by a Moment"" is not even the best song in the album!"
4,VERY GOOD BUT.....,Now...if you listened to each of the songs on this CD individually each one would be really really good. But if you listen to every song on the cd in a row then you get really tired of listening to the same stuff over and over again. I think Lifehouse is ready to go to the next level and i know they are capable of it. You can hear it in the song Quasimodo. This is the best song on the cd. They added some more guitar and made it a little heavier. I think that this cd just needs more variety. Im looking forward to their next one.
4,Guilty Pleasure,"This album is my guilty pleasure du jour. It's so FM-radio (she says, sounding like a complete snob); really, it is. Everytime I station-surf, there's Lifehouse AGAIN. But, all of that aside, this is a great album. I love putting it on in my car and singing at the top of my lungs. It's perfect for that. :)"
5,I Guess it's the Only One,"What can I say? Words cannot describe how much I love this CD. Every single song on this album is simple, raw, touching, inspiring, moving, amazing, and can be in the stereo all day without boredom. My advice to you is to buy it. If you don't like it............ nevermind, that's impossible!"
5,Songwriting at its best,"When I first heard Lifehouse's ""Hanging by a moment"", I knew I wanted to hear more from them. Every song takes me on a journey with thought-provoking lyrics and heartful melodies. Jason Wade's songwriting talent is so amazing, and inspiring to me as a songwriter as well. There will never be another band like them, they are truly one-of-a-kind."
5,Why Settle for less - A definate buy!!!,"Often times the Christian music industry obviously is unaware of what is going on in the ""real"" music world. Not in this recording!!! The lyrics, the arrangement, production...is off the hook. This recording can go head to head with any of the cd's on the christian bookstore shelves. Don't wait. This is cutting edge music. Can't wait for their next recording."
5,Great for Everyone,"It is the ultimate, perfect cd. I love this cd. Pretty much everyone will like it. It is a clean cd that speaks to each person in a different way. Sometimes my friend and I will talk for long periods of time just about the lyrics. Bottom line, you will like what you get, this cd is worth much more than the price."
2,not for me,"The single ""Hanging by the Moment"" is very misleading of the band. This band plays very slow songs most of the time. I was mislead by the single and bought the album only to be dissappointed when I put it in the player. But if you like soft music and not the upbeat ""Hanging by the moment"" you will probably like this album"
5,I luv these guys!,"One day I was cruis'n in my car and I heard this song on 100.3 and I loved it.When the song finished, I wrote down the title on a napkin I had in the glove compartment.The song was ""Hanging By A Moment"" by Lifehouse.Then, I came home and downloaded it off Napster and put it on my portable MP3 player.Now, I listen to it all the time.Then, tonight, I came on here and looked Lifehouse up.I listened to all the audio samples and I was blown away.I absolutely love these guys!"
5,WOW!!!,"I got this CD for my birthday back in December, and listened to only the first song (Hanging By A Moment) for about two months. When I finally discovered the rest of the album, I was amazed - these guys are GOOD!! I had the opportunity to check them out in concert last week, and they're incredible. There's not a song on the CD that I don't like, but my favorites are Somewhere In Between, Simon, Sick Cycle Carousel, and Cling and Clatter. Seeing them perform in person was awesome (and I even got ""guitar guy"" Stuart to sign my CD booklet). My prediction is that Lifehouse will go far... buy this CD, you won't be disappointed!"
3,"It's POPPY,CHEESEY and GOOD","I saw Lifehouse a few times this summer and they have a sound that is very catchy. They are not inventing anything new but with all the Pearl Jam Rip-Offs that are out there I think these guys are actually pretty good. The singer/Songwriter writes good catchy pop songs and the have tight guitar arrangements. I even told them this summer there song ""hanging on by The Moment"" would be a hit before there CD was even released. It had a chorus everyone could sing along to. They were very nice guys and I am glad to see them doing well. The CD is a good pickup for anyone that is into good POP songs with a Pearl Jam kinda sound. Shawn"
3,Not my kind of music.,"Sometimes, you just can't bring yourself to like an artist. For me this is one of those times.I naturally got this album because of the its single and standout track, ""Hanging By A Moment,"" assuming the rest of the album would consist of emotional rock songs in the same vein.Well, the other songs are definately emotional rock songs, but at the same time, they are not in the same vein. Most of the songs have a more confessional or devotional feel to them, and that's just something I don't like very much.For what it's worth, Jason Wade is fairly good at what he does, enough that I can see his talent, even though the music isn't to my taste.Bottom line: Borrow this album before you buy it."
5,Brilliant Album,"In my opinion Hanging By A Moment is by far the worst song on the album, so you can see what the other songs are like. Reminded me somewhat on the ""Better Life"" Album by 3 Doors down but it's not as aggressive. I Really really love this album and i recommend it to everyone of you who likes soft rock music."
2,"""Hanging By A Moment"" is all they have got.","I am a 21 year old male and this is my take on this album. ""Hanging By A Moment"" could be in my top 10 songs of all time but that is all this album has to offer. When you listen to the other tracks it sounds like a completely different artist. I would have bet money that ""Hanging By A Moment"" was done by a completely different artist than the other 10 tracks. My advice is to not waste your money on this album. The other tracks are horrible. If whining and moaning is your type of music then you might like this album, but if you are buying it because you think that all the tracks are like track 1 then don't."
2,SO MUCH POTENTIAL ..SO LITTLE TO SHOW..,"HANGING BY A MOMENT HAD TO BE ONE OF THE BEST ROCK SONGS OF THAT ERA....IT WAS FRESH....CATCHY AS HELL!!..KILLER MELODIES...SO HOPING THE ALBUM WOULD FEATURE MUCH THE SAME I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WHEN I GOT THE CD...HOWEVER THE SONG ""EVERYTHING"" IS AWESOME... MAKING THIS ALBUM STARTING + ENDING WITH A GREAT SONG BUT FILLER IN BETWEEN..WAIT FOR THE GREATEST HITS FROM THESE GUYS........"
2,One hit wonder,"Ummm yeah... that one song you hear all over on the radio is the only good song on the whole cd. Not what I expected. I have owned this cd for a while now and tried a number of times to listen to it, but I can't get past the second song without hitting the next track button a few times and then the eject button. Most bands have one or two ballad type slow songs for the females, but that is all this cd is. It's like the cd was written for the top 40. They probably figured if they release a whole cd of alternative-slow songs at least one will be a big hit and get played over and over again. Don't expect more than the same type of songs repeated on this cd. I am not saying this is the worst cd I have ever heard, but there are a lot better out there. Save yourself the money and just buy the single. I don't expecet to hear much of this band after this cd wears out."
5,loved every single song!,"I am not exaggerating when I say this, but I loved every single song in this cd. The songs kind of grow on you because the first time that I listened to it, the only song that I liked was ""hanging by a moment"". After listening to it a few more times however, I began to like the other songs as well, even more so in fact, and now I am absolutely addicted!The lyrics are well written - very introspective and sometimes even poetic, without sounding like a personal diary. The melodies are also great - not too heavy on my ears, and Jason Wade's voice just rocks! Sometimes I don't even bother trying to understand what he's saying because the way he sings the lyrics is enough to make you feel what the song is all about.My favorite track is ""unknown"" - i like the guitar intro, the chorus (which is really catchy), and the lyrics. But like I said, every single song in this album is worth listening to, so go out now and buy the cd, you won't regret it!"
4,A personal fave...,"I think that Lifehouse's Hanging By A Moment is a good example of rock music. My collection includes everything from BBMak to Linkin Park, Prozzak to M2M, and Lifehouse is at the top of it. They have lyrics that compare to the Goo Goo Dolls, and a sound that is a mix of Creed, Sister Hazel, and Evan & Jaron. Great CD, great music, great band."
4,"Beautiful lyrics, beautiful music, beautiful band...","I had a friend recommend that I download ""Hanging By A Moment"" so I did, and I was entranced. I'm not the type of person to go out and spontaniously buy a cd that I know relativly nothing about, but I took a chance on Lifehouse and was not dissapointed. The musical quality of this group is unmatched in todays music scene. Everything is completely origional and honest. Lead singer Jason Wade is an excellent writer and it definately shows in the heartfelt lyrics of this album. Almost every song is absolutly beautiful. For anyone who enjoys bands that have a hard edge, but with lyrics that can really speak to you, this album is a definate must-have!!"
5,Loved the Entire CD!,"I just went out and bought this CD and I love every song on it. There are not many CD's I can say that about. That means this is a good band, not just a band who can play a couple good songs. Their sound is unique and the lead singers voice is soothing (for lack of better word) There is also a deeper meaning behind each song and the lyrics are powerful."
1,"How can anyone call this ""rock""????","Warning to consumers grazing along looking for ""Rock"". I see review after review labeling this release as rock. I'm not saying this is a bad effort by Lifehouse because clearly I would be wrong since there are over 600 reviews with a 5 star rating. The production is really good. But personally, using my definition of rock ... you can't go to sleep listening to rock ... rock wakes you up ... this effort in its entirety is not rock ... not even close.Really I think the amazon review nailed it best with ""melodies that mark Lifehouse's radio-friendly sound are not unlike those of matchbox twenty or Live in their softer moments"" and ""think Crowded House at their lilting best""."
2,Okay CD but not nice in person,This is just another poor example of how stupid people want to be famous. These guys are jerks in person and their cd is of pretty much poor quality. In my personal opinion it's a no good buy but the choice is yours.
3,Too little too late,"Not only is Pearl Jam one of the greatest bands of the 90's, the record industry knows it and will look at a band like Lifehouse, Creed or Fuel and go ""I like their Pearl Jam-esque quality"" and use that to sign them. A band can still suck, but as long as they sound like Eddie Vedder it's ok. If you like this album, good for you, but look into a band called Matthew Good Band from Canada. They just released ""Beautiful Midnight"" in America and if you're looking for the kind of music Lifehouse wish they could play, Matthew Good Band can play it correctly. That is all."
1,Had to rate as 1 star to offset all the stupid 5 stars,"Compared to their latest album, this album is terrible. This album really only has 3 good songs, the rest are sung horribly, with a musical background that is pretty much not cohesive, and incapable of flowing correctly. It's like someone took a chainsaw to the rest of their songs.This is seriously crap compared to their latest album."
1,No Life Found.....,"Lifehouse is a one hit wonder. There is no denying this. The lead singer's voice is ratty and unpleasant, and every song on the CD sounds very much alike. The CD has only one good song, and that's ""Hanging By A Moment"". Every other song is slow and boring. Don't buy this awful record!!"
3,3 1/2 Stars--Pretty Good Debut Album,"This is a pretty solid debut album from the boys of Lifehouse. The lead singer Jason Wade sings with strong conviction and emotion. The songs have meaning and they make you think. The downside of this album though is that some of the songs have a tendency to sound alike. The best songs on the album are Hanging By A Moment, Only One, Simon, Breathing, Quasimodo, Somewhere In Between, and Everything. Another down point is that the band never really ""rock"" out. This isn't the worst down point but if your looking for a rock and roll experience look elsewhere. This album sounds more like rock lullabies. Still, though, this album is better than most albums put out today. The band wrote all the songs and played their own instruments unlike most marketed ""artists"" out today."
3,good debut album,"No Name Face is a good cd and for about the twentieth time I wish you could rate with 1/2. This CD really deserves a 3.5 but I am not going to give it 4 stars for a few reasons. It isn't exactly phenomenal or brilliant to me. The lyrics are decent, and would probably mean a lot more to me if I was religious because they do have a strong spiritual theme (which is much better than incessantly hearing the ""f word"" over and over in meaningless songs). The songs are very catchy and I can listen to the whole CD and only skip over one track (Simon). Considering the fact that I usually like more hardcore rock, alternative and punk music and can't stand preachy ""Christian rock"" me liking this cd means a lot of people with varying tastes will probably like it. Not a bad cd."
5,INCREDIBLE,"I have never been so completely satisfyed with a CD. I bought No Name Face on impulse after hearing Hanging by a Moment on the radio. I wasn't expecting to love it, because i heard they were like Creed, which i grow tired and annoyed with very quickly. Much to my surprise, this is probably the only CD i've ever bought where i like every single song. I can't say enough good things about it. I've listened to it every day for the past 3 weeks, someitmes 3 times in a row and i'm not even close to being bored with it. The music is great, and unique, and the lyircs are deep and meaningful. This is a great debut and i can't wait to see what Lifehouse comes up with in the future."
2,A little too soft,"I have been hearing ""Hangning By a Moment"" mostly on a local alternative station. I expected this to be one of the softer songs on the album. I was dissappointed to find out that this song is the most energetic cut on the album. Its not bad, but not what I was looking for. Reminds me of Matchbox 20."
5,Truly inspiring,"These guys are fantastic! Coming from England you don't hear much of these guys around here but i happened to catch the end of 'Hanging by the moment' on a music channel when it first came out on and i instantly loved it but never heard it again. I luckly got the name of the band and went to America a couple of months later and got the album, it's never left the C.D player!There music is so inspiring and each track is different i love the way theres such a powerful energy building up in the song 'Everything' and theres so much feeling in the writing of the songs. Jason Wade has a gripping voice and i love listening to the album lying in the dark and letting the music just hit me. I've tried to get everyone i no over hear to listen to their music and everyone of them has loved Lifehouse since."
3,"A dissapointment, but still good","A wile ago, I picked up a copy of Lifehouses album ""No Name Face"" after hearing ""Hangin By A Moment"". This was odd for me. Normally I listen to the cd online or in the store before I buy it. But for some reason, I didn't do that with this one. Sorry to say, I wish I had. I found this album truly dissapointing to me. There are a few good tracks, but it's not as good as I suspected."
4,Good stuff,"Let's face it, people who write reviews on these pages only rate the albums they love, hence you don't see too much real cryticism here.Although I bought this record through Amazon's list mania, from a cutomer that had liked similar music to my tastes, I was quite dissappointed about this album, as I couldn't separate in my head the different sounds / instruments. It had good qualities to be come top notch, but sounded all too confusing.It took me 5 to 6 listenings of the CD to realise how good it really was, but unfortunately I believe the producer was not good enough to give more shine and brilliance on the sounds and ideas the band generates.The lyrics are extremely well conceived, sung in a very personal way that makes it difficult to catch but very enlightening and personal.Like I said, really good stuff here. I'll buy the next releases from them, I'm sure they'll be as good as this one."
2,"Blah, blah, blah ... yada, yada, yada","I was bored. It's not that this band lacks talent, it just seems to lack innovation. The first single was grossly overplayed which didn't help a song I was already bored with. This whole CD just sounds too much like everything else on the radio that's in the same genre. Again, this isn't a ""bad"" CD, it just lacks pizazz."
4,LifeHouse has great stuff,Recent fan of Lifehouse and I really enjoy the music. They have Christian based lyrics and very nice to listen to.
5,The Lifehouse is God,"When I first got this cd I didn't know what to expect. I now know. It is an awesome cd. Jason Wade's lyrics are sad but hopeful. His voice is mature for his age, but his voice shines on all of the songs. The musicianship of the band is excellent. Jason Wade's guitar playing shines through the entire album. The bass player gets to show off his talent. Now the drummer could improve. His beats on the songs are pretty simple, but that is a minor mistake. Hanging by a moment is a strong opener. Quasimodo, and Simon talk about the world and it's faults. I would strongly recommend this cd for Creed fans or for people who like good, clean, loud music that praises God."
4,Invasion of the Bodyslammers,"Matches are:Yokozuna vs EarthquakeThe Nasty Boys vs The Beverly BrothersThe Undertaker vs Razor RamonBam Bam Bigelow vs TyphoonIntercontinental ChampionshipShawn Michaels w/Sherri vs Bret HartDoink vs KamalaUndertaker vs Papa Shango16 Man Battle RoyalRepo Man vs TatankaRic Flair vs Mr. PerfectPlus: Slick teaches Kamala how to bowl, At work with Repo ManI've watched wrestling my whole life, and i really enjoyed this tape. There are some very cheap prices on here, and its worth it for this tape in my opinion."
5,One Piece As It Should Be!,"I had bought this after already feverishly getting 1 and 2. It is amazing! I love One Piece, and was very disgusted with what 4Kids did to it.Funimation does a simply FANTASTIC job with their Uncut One Piece. Nami's voice actor has some extremely intense scenes in this set, and executes them all perfectly.Even if you watch the Japanese Version of One Piece (Which I still do, as well as read the manga), you will love these box sets! And I can't wait for the next one to come out!Funimaiton, excellent job!"
4,The best,This cd is was better than any of his others I have to say. I bump this cd when I work out and when I get back from Iraq I will definitely bump it in my truck. One of my favs hands down. If you like gangsta music or music you ride to this is the cd for you I promise. Young Buck came hard on this one.
5,DIRTY SOUTH IN THE BUILDING,"Another hard CD by young buck. About equal with SOC. My cuts include buck the world, slow ya roll, hold on, puff puff pass, 4 kings, clean up man, buss ya head, and i ain't f---- with you. Cop it if you like good down south music."
4,Not the same...,This album is good but not the same without that 50 influence... Buck is very talented and deserves his props though.
2,expected more,the album was ok but i expected more from him. he proved me wrong when i said he was the south. consistency is every thing and appears only in great mc's. to be quite frank this album took buck out of my top five for todys rappers and out of my top 20 of all time.
3,"Buck The World, Indeed!","So I was a little apprehensive about this cd. The stuff from G-Unit lately has been bad. But Im glad to say that Buck delivered a great album. All the songs have nice beats and his lyrics are on point. He definitely stepped his lyric game up. Its a big improvement from his last cd. And you can hear a new sense of passion and hunger in his voice when he raps, so you can feel and believe everything he talks about. Overall, I definitely recommend this cd to any big rap fans out there. You wil not be disappointed. Hit Songs: Get Buck, Push Em Back, Buck The World(THE BEST SONG!!!)"
1,Is this really what I waited for,"After getting Buck's album I have to say that I am not impressed with the lyrics.. The beats are nice, but they should be with Dre in your corner. Throughout the whole album Buck rarely changes his delivery or rap pattern. Has he not learned anything from Lloyd Banks second album. This album is OK but simply does not have the energy of his project. I respect Prodigy and Lil Flip more than buck because it seems like he cannot do an album without 50 cent. Buck is from Tenn but spends half his album talking about New York. If you need something to listen to desperately or you just listen to beats then you should buy it. I warn you though, this album however will not set any trends!"
1,Germain,Why would anyone want to read this garbage?Do the world a favour and stick copies on the bonfire this Autumn.
3,Schumanns book of his own cocktails,"one reviewer accuses another of quibling over a couple of recipes, when in fact the quibble is over 11 very well-known recipes.Calling Schumann ""the master"" is a bit much. Some people love him like a god, while others (like me) see him as stuck in an era just after 70's faux-cocktails, and just before this new renaissance in historically researched cocktails. Schumann is a bit of an enigma, if he is right why doesn't he explain his research and way of thinking? He is too good to talk to those who bought his book?At the end of the day it is just a book of how Charles Schumann makes his cocktails, and is not of any historical value.Try the Joy of Mixology by Gary Regan for a better balanced veiw of cocktails."
3,"Beautifu. book, weak content","I bought this book approx 7 years ago when I was learning to bartend. It makes a great presentation in my ""library"". But no recipes for Cosmopolitans(?) This is during the comeback of the cocktail.I tend to use my Ultimate A to Z Bar Guide more often. The American Bar is not aimed at the usual bar clientèle."
2,Not As Advertised,The product description says that this Bumper is Silver and comes with adapter...The product received was GRAY not SILVER and there was no adapter. Additionally I could not find a phone number for the store.
2,Buy Extened warranty through Timex- you will need it!,"Indiglo stopped working after 4 months. Sent back to timex, under warranty, and they still charge you $8 to fix it. Its been there over 3 weeks and still have not received my watch back. It did not take a licking but still stopped ticking........................"
3,Disappointed,"I have been using this version of Timex watches for years and they gradually getting worse. This model is the worst. it is a good looking watch and that's about it! The price looked reasonable until I walked into Target and found it at about 40% less than the ""low price"" I paid at Amazon (including Shp).Cons:the specifications show the bezzele diameter as 45mm, actually it is 38mm. they probably included the knobs in their measurement. The alarm is a joke you have to hold it against your ear to hear it. The instructions are poorly written and confusing and hard to uderstand."
2,Treat it carefully...,"So I bought this watch to travel with, because I can dress it up and dress it down, not worry about water, have an alarm instead of carrying an alarm clock, etc. Except after I went swimming in the Mediterranean, I immediately noticed water in the case, and a lot of moisture had built up underneath the crystal. It kept appearing whenever the watch would change temperatures for about two weeks, and now I've noticed that the alarm function has started failing too. I haven't figured out when it rings and stuff, but if I try and set the alarm within 60 minutes, it rings an hour after it's supposed to, and the 12-hour alarm doesn't ring at all.I'm not sure if it's just this watch or if it's all of this model, but i'm pretty disappointed in Timex for this one. I really like the look of it, but if I can't take it for a swim once, even though it's ""Water Resistant to 100M"", it's definitely not worth the $70 to me"
4,Nice wathes did`t expect they have good quality,I have spend a lot of time for searching wathes for myself. After all I found that only this model satisfied me in this price range. I would say that price for this model incredible cheap. I recommend for everyone it is a good and stile watches.
5,An Aural Delight,"Billy delivers Country & Western warbles like no other. He has the charisma, the charm, the looks and the lyrical aptitude. I wish I was living in a small corner of Billy's head so that I would be a party to his musical genuis all the time. This is also an incredible versatile album, it perfectly suits driving, housekeeping, relaxing and seducing. There is something for everyone on this Billy Xtravaganza, including the timeless heartbreak ballad and line dancing anthem 'achy breaky heart'. What makes this musical maelstrom so perfectly peachy, is that you know Billy means each and every heart felt word he sings. You know he has been through the heartbreak, the tough times, and come through, like a rhinestone cowboy on the other side, strong, all powerful and ready to claim 'his woman'. If Billy wasn't a singer, he'd be a superhero. One things for sure, at the gas station of lurrrve, Billy didn't get the self service pump."

5,A great collection by a great artist!,"If you were or are a fan of Billy Ray Cyrus,then this collection is a must have! All of his biggest hits are here,including his biggest ever,Acky Breaky Heart,which started the country line dance craze back in the early 90s! All BRC fans should have this cd in their collections!"
2,LET DOWN,"The story ran smoothly, but the ending was not exciting...it just ended. Definitely not up to Clancy standards. One good thing: The chapters were short --- just right for bedtime reading."
2,Tom Clancy Obviously did not write this one!,"I agree with the others who panned this. It is full of obvious errors, and they show the gross ignorance of the author. The one that got me and sticks is his description of the men in the Sampan using the oars to get close to the yacht. They 'oared' there. Oared is not a word. When men use oars to move a ship, boat, or any floating vessel, the term used to move it is ROW. You row a boat, you use 10 foot oars in a viking ship to ROW the ship. One paddles a canoe, but one does not OAR a boat. Obviously this book was thrown together in as short a time as possible, given minimal proof reading, and then published. Tom Clancy should be ashamed to have his name put on it."
3,Snowboard Beginner,"This video was the best beginning video about snowboarding available. Lots of practice skill sets were provided that I was able to apply on the slopes each time I went. The speaker was a very slow talker with a few silly catch phrases, but the message delivered was valuable to my advancement in snowboard as a beginner. I have slowly applied each skill to both my left leg leading and right leg leading. Learning and developing the muscle memory to make each move is essential for a beginner. Try not to get frustrated and give up, keep at it and put what you learn from the video and from actual practice together and each day at the slope will be a great one."
3,It is okay....,"This is not at all a bad video, the first one I bought. However, for a learner, it does not really teach you how to control the board, it tells you what you should be doing and different carving techniques, but not how to do it. Go Snowboard: Read It, Watch It, Do It (GO SERIES) by Neil McNab - is so much of a better resource, especially with their technique of teaching the four points of control of the snowboard, and how the flexing the board controls it. This is not bad, but McNab's book / DVD is so much better in both information and video quality."
2,Not Enough Detail,"I'm a lifelong skier, but after seeing all those people on snowboards having so much fun, I finally decided to try it for myself. I bought this DVD hoping to accelerating my learning curve. On the plus side, Kurt the instructor is a lot of fun and he gives you a lot of exercises to practice. However, there's just not enough detail. For some people, learning to do toeside and heelside turns may be intuitive, but for me, I need much more detailed directions. All he pretty much says is to dig your toes or heels into the snow! On the slopes, my instructor went over a lot of things (weight shifting, hip positioning, etc) which Kurt never mentions in his video."
4,Excellent Starting Point,"This is a good video for those starting out. It's a little cheesy at some points, but seeing the basics helped me put everything together when i started learning to link turns."
5,fresh start snowboarding,"excellent dvd very informative very well done, lots of info and very easy to follow would highly recommend!!!"
2,Look elsewhere,Dated teaching materials. KK is probably a good instructor in person but fails to explain why to move in a motion. You can get better and more current instruction from other places. Rated a 2 because it's not the worst I've seen.
2,Somewhat disappointed...,"Heron's experiences are entertaining. She writes with humor and with honesty. However, her writing is somewhat choppy and even slow in places. I felt disappointed at the end of this book, somehow let down by her lack of 'depth' and insight into the suffering that she witnessed daily. Her clinical evaluations and uplifting sense of humor were a treat, but spiritual and psychological observations were not easily found in this work."
2,Forgets Who Nursings worse enemies are,"I found the book entertaining, because like Heron, I used to work as a nurse and am now a full time writer. I also lived and worked in the Bay Area, and know the hospital that she writes about. However, Heron seems to find enough people to lash out at, but she seldom mentions that nurses are their own worst enemies. Nurses rarely if ever stand up for themselves, they are great at complaining among themselves but when it comes to doing something about a problem--well, nobody wants to rock the boat. Nurses are great at backstabbing, they don't stick together--in short, nurses are treated without disrespect by doctors and hospital administrators because they tolerate it without a peep. So it always bugs me when high and mighty nurses complain about everyone under the sun except themselves. As for Heron's writing, it is okay but a little melodramatic."
5,Readable and convincing,"This book is geared toward evangelizing Muslims. Shirly Isaac compares the characterists of Allah as listed in the Koran with those of Yahveh listed in the Bible. This reveals that Allah and Yahveh are not the same divine person. Moreover, the comparison reveals that you will want to be associated with Jesus and Yahveh. You will want Allah and Muhammad to stay far away!"
1,A book best suited for the trash bin,"The title sounds impressive, but again the neophyte author, ""Sherly Isaac"" humours us with her bad English and convulting, repulsive arguments. Much like her earlier work ""Is Jesus God?"", she again draws upon her ""personal experiences"" and misquotations from the Glorious Qur'an and the Ahadith texts. Her arguments have been thoroughly refuted on several Muslim websites and this url is especially of interest to the ""question"" proposed by Ms. Isaac...."
3,A tragic porn star?? Who would have thought?!,"This is a pretty saucy read overall, but also a little silly in that the author was trying to convey a sense of surprise that Stefano's life turned out to be such a big disaster. I mean, what would you expect? He was a porn star, drug addicted prostitute. That does not lend itself to a bed of roses. Not to slam the actual Nick Iacona fellow, I know it was horribly tough road for him, though he did get to get a few kicks along the way.I think the book best serves as a true cautionary tale for anyone who might actually consider making a porno film on a lark or thinking about a harmless and quick stint in the adult film industry. This book makes it appear as though you had best have your last will and testament notarized before the cameras start rolling."
1,Terribly dull...,"Chi Chi LeRue, Karen Dior or Mickey Skee should have written this, or even Crystal Crawford. There's no emotion or heart in this book. Go read any of the articles about Joey, not this."
4,Give him a break...he's dead for christ sake.,Just spent a sad 5 mins reading the reviews about the life of Joey Stefano. Christ the guy is dead. tragic. Always hear the same sad old queens harping on about porn and the drugs industry. Yes Joey was responsible for his life and choices. He was rewarded handsomely for his roles. He didn't deserve to die.Strange how the very guys who berate porn stars have book shelves filled with porn. If it get to you that much don't buy the stuff and don't buy excellent books which light the arena of gay porn.Plain scared people are the worst. They never have to worry about the industry because their chances of attaining any porn career have been hampered by mother nature at birth.Shut up and let the rest of us star in and buy what we enjoy.
2,Ho-Hum,"Although it's no fault of the author, I simply could not feel sorry for Mr. Stefano. The book spends a lot of time trying to build a case that the porn industry did Stefano in; but I didn't buy it. He was basically a drug addicted prostitute and chose his own lifestyle. When we lose an artist in the music field (like Janis Joplin, Jimmi Hendrix, etc) or the entertainment field (like River Phoenix, Judy Garland, etc) from an overdose, there is a real void in our culture because these people brought something to our arts and culture. I'm sorry, the loss of Joey Stefano certainly doesn't bring any kind of loss to society. It's too bad a young man died the way he did, but his ""talents"" are not irreplaceable or to be mourned for."
4,"Haunting, carefully-crafted, heavy.","A gut-wretching biography of a beautiful man who could never get a handle on his life. It tells us a good bit about the exploitive gay-porn industry in the unhappily meteoric career of Joey: quick fame, over-exposure, and sinking star. The destructive catastropes of drugs, AIDS, self-destructiveness all come home in the life of one of the hottest bottoms in the porn trade. The final third of the bio moves with an inevitability that is good, but sometimes pretty obviously worked. You won't forget this book."
3,How did the porn star feel?,"in fact i don't really like the book, but there is something which is really make me feel sorry with this guy. that is the part when stefeno was asked to write down all his problems, and he simply wrote down: No job No money No self-esteem No confidence All I have is my look and my body and there's not working anymore i feel washed-up Drug problem Hate life HIV-positive! Very sad, isn't it. Now i understand how is a porn star feel behind the charm."
1,Tragic or Pathetic,"I expected this book to give insights into the porn industry and its ride to ruin, but I didn't get that. All I came away with was a junkie who sold his body, used dope when people treated him like an object, then died. The author kept a neutral attitude toward the pornographers that was journalistic, to be sure. I don't think I would have been so objective."
3,what a sad life!,"Not as badly written as I expected. Joey Stefano clearly was not a man of intellect (indeed quite the opposite) so the book is very short and can be read in 60-90 minutes. The ghost writer is mediocre. But the content.....what a sad miserable life without a moment of happiness, with no goals or aspirations, or joy.The hedonistic lifestyle he sought only made him more empty and despairing. I thought perhaps he was just poorly educated but it is clear he hardly had 2 neurones to rub together. Actually according to the book the whole porn industry is sad , despairing , desperate and drug addled and I am sure that's an accurate depiction. Perhaps the punishment for beauty is misery, it seems to be the inadvertent theme to the book. A good read if you've got nothing better to do for a short time (or a better book to read) and have a prurient interest the porn industry of late 80's to 90's. But it is 90 minutes you'll never get back."
4,"beautiful people have problems, too","Stefano was beautiful -- pretty, actually -- and was determined to have a career in porn. Unfortunately he lacked the self-confidence to resist the drugs and build a new career beyond porn.From my own life I know what it's like to watch a friend spiral into self-destructive behavior and not know what to do to help them. So this story touched me in a deeper way -- I felt the helplessness his friends around him felt about his behavior.Lacking from the book, I think, is more info about his home life before he met LaRue. We don't get to know his family at all before the porn career begins and we only see his mom briefly fter his death.Also, I get the feeling the author (Isherwood) met or knew Stefano. I wish the author had written a foreword or afterword that discussed why he chose to write a biography on Stefano. Part of the story is missing."
3,Poor Joey knew no real friends,"I don't know that I can review the book, so much as the subject of the book. The book is written much like a Hollywood gossip column and bears little resemblence to a real biography, HOWEVER, it does give insight into a line of work that has been glamourized in the gay community. It's a world where flesh is currency and manipulation and lying are the name of the game. It seems that the flesh brokers (the filmmakers and distributors) are the only ones going to the bank with the proceeds of the films. How sad it is that the porn actors seem to be so insecure and uneducated that they don't save for their future or keep away from the drugs. Not a great book - but a great insight into the porn biz. Maybe we should print bumper stickers saying, ""Have you hugged your porn star today?"""
4,A Parable for Our Gay Times,"With the explosion of porn distribution on the net and the constant rise and fall of ""stars"" being basically anyone paid to be naked for an orgasm in front of a camera at any time in their lives, the story of Joey Stefano is a cautionary tale that many ought heed. This entertainingly written and fairly well researched biography is a brief but revealing text. Perhaps Stefano's life could not carry a longer book, either. In any event, the reader will join him on a fast down escalator into self-destruction that shows the reality of low self-esteem, emotional insecurity, and short life span (in the marketplace or, like Stefano, literally) that often marks the human fabric of this industry. Well worth the investment of time and money, not least because a number of the people in the book, like Chi Chi LaRue, continue as active presences in the business of the meat market."
1,Didn't Fit,"Great idea, but should be adjustable to fit all window sills. I bought several of these, and none fit."
3,"Reasonable quality, low price but did not fit my window frame","I live on the ground floor apartment with 5 windows. I wanted to be able to lock the windows in place even if they were open. The item description did not include enough details of the size and geometry. These clips were too small to fit. I have never seen a window frame these could fit on.It was a let down, but they were very cheap. I guess the lesson is you get what you pay for.In the end I used some non-slip wedget-type door stops to prevent the window from being opened. I also used a few strips of wood, trimmed to length that allow the window to be secured when partially opened."
1,Useless,All the theif has to do is break a pane and unscrew it. I have them and they don't help. Found them on the floor 2x now under the broken window. Hundreds of $ worth of stuff gone.
1,don't work,"these things are a waste of money. I can still open my windows when I have them ""secured"" with these little bolts."
4,Speedy and cheap!,"My son needed locks for his sliding windows, and these were quicker than going to still more hardware stores (we tried 5!) to find them. Also cheaper. Arrived in a couple of days. Amazon is SO much more than books!Heather BanksGaithersburg, MD"
5,Get This Album Now!,"After reading about these guys in some magazine, I decided to get the album. I'm really glad I did because its great! This is some of the better thrash/death metal I've heard in a while. The singing and guitars on this album are very good. I would definately recomend this to anyone who likes this genre of music. Another thing that is neat about this band is that they are from Japan. Its good to see that they have an interest in good metal over there as well."
4,Plunging Into Megadeath...,"Excellent Neo-thrash from Japanese four-piece! This will be a great addition to the collection of any fan of The Haunted, The Crown, Dew Scented, Ritual Carnage or Defleshed. Tons of precision-executed Kreator riffs, with a bit of that ol' Exodus/Forbidden Bay-Area groove for good measure and a dose of diversity. Extremely well produced with a full-range sound that doesn't sarfice clarity for aggression. Hope to see more from these guys in the future!"
4,thrash attack !!!,"this is some intense Kreator and Sodom worship from the far east! utilizing blazing fast drumming and whiplash inducing riffs, King's Evil make thrash sound just as alive and well as it was back in the glory days! the recording is crisp and tight and captures all the raw power and technical precision of each one of these eight speed metal masterpieces. thrash metal seems to have been making a big comeback with bands like Exodus reforming and putting out praise-worthy new albums, but King's Evil shows that this kind of metal never went away. dedicated followers take note, Deletion Of Humanoise is a grand and tightly wound execution of real metal!"
4,The Japanese show their devotion to metal...,"This album is amazing. It's hyper-aggressive thrash in the style of old Slayer with slightly more melody. And best of all, the lyrics are all in english. The reason that I give it 4 stars is that some of the english is completely off. Otherwise, this Japanese band shows that it can shred. I know that there aren't samples to listen to, so search on the web for clips to see if you'll like the CD. Trust me, you won't regret it."
3,Never saw this one before.,I must say it was quite interesting. We shouldn't have to type anymore then what we want as the review
1,A really lame movie,When I go to look at a movie at Amazon I always see a free one that looks good like Lake Dead. If you like a formula movie that features college age girls getting slaughtered who talk like 8th graders this is the one for you. The men are equally as stupid. Zero stars. Oh my gosh.
2,"""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" meets ""The Hill Have Eyes"" but not as good","Another movie that a cast that consist of hot girls, but just not enough nudity to make up for how boring this moive really is, its just corny, in-breads that run a hotel and just so happens that they're the only law around, (kinda like ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" meets ""The Hill Have Eyes"") if you like movies..... Find another movie you think you might be interested in, and buy it!"
2,"It was bad, but NOT that bad!","I love all types of movie from the horror genere, including camp and B or even C. This being said, this movie still wasn't very good, I did read about it and went in with some expectations. Oops! If they would have cut out the grunting incest caveman guys, it could have worked. Incest is a freaky subject, and the scenes with the normal looking people freaked me out way more than the guys from the Caveman commerical did. Acting was bad, but the setting, and the lake and woods were great. Also, it was shot better than most of the horrorfest movies. I can't reccomend it unless you like the same movies I do, and even then you may be wishing you didn't."
1,WORTHLESS,"If I could have given this film ""no"" stars as a rating, I would have. Unfortunately the rating system requires at least one star. Listen. Don't waste your money on this crap. This is perhaps the most ineffective and boring film that ever dared to call itself ""horror"". The manifest ""horror"" in this film..., two mentally warped idiot twins born from incest..., looked like little more than hunched over stage hands in overalls with shaggy hair. They carried hand axes that were too small to chop wood let alone bones. Yet they seemed to make short work of cutting people up. And then there was the family-incest theme..., VERY poorly done..., sickening yes, but hardly horrific. The real horror was that I wasted my time watching this nonsense.- Mike Silverman"
1,The characters were dead before the movie started,"This movie is about a group of girls with low self-esteem, the guys witn no self-esteem they settle for and their road trip to a lake where they're not killed off fast enough. Don't let Freddie hear you call this a ""horror movie"". He would be insulted."
3,Blood is thicker than water...,"After Dark has led me astray with films before. I have been disappointed in the past. This time though, I saw the synopsis and wanted to try it out since I adore movies about camping, horror, inbred family torturers, etc... This film wasn't too bad at all. It surprised me, I was expecting the usual implication of death but NO SHOW of gore that After Dark is known for, but nope. It showed the gore, it had a great plot, and it kept my attention. To describe it in my own way I'd have to say Hills Have Eyes meets Wrong Turn meets Motel Hell. Pretty good, pick it up for Friday flick and have some friends over, you won't be disappointed! ;) 3.5 I'm hoping for a part 2, it certainly left itself open for one."
2,It Had Potential...,"A trio of sisters and their friends take a trip to check out a piece of property they inherited from a grandfather they never met. The twist is that the grandfather and his family are inbred mutant rednecks...And so are the sisters!! Sounds interesting enough in theory. And actually it was very watchable for the first 30 minutes. However, the movie goes downhill after a very fake looking rape scene jars the viewer back to his senses and reminds us that this isn't a very good movie. From this point on the bad guys commit a number of incompetent blunders and the heroic male lead shows us his superhuman strength and tenacity a number of times.The movie takes a more comical turn which ruins any suspense that may have built up previously and leaves the viewer wishing for better days..."
1,Printing Errors Galore,"This book has approximately one typo per page, which is annoying in itself but also detracts from the flow of the text. It also underlines every occurrence of ""store"" or ""buy."" Is this some weird subliminal message? It has a very small font, which is strange given that the target audience for this book would be ages 8-12. The interior pictures were repetitive versions of the ugly cover picture. I remembered this book from my youth and bought it for my daughter, but wouldn't recommend it for anyone. Find another edition and buy that."
5,One Of Brewer's Best,"For those who only know Teresa Brewer from her cutey pooh recordings, of which her label Coral produced far too many, this album will be a complete surprise. She is sophisticated, sexy, and still very much Brewer in her unique way. The voice is simply gorgeous here, with all the heartbreak, longing, and worldliness these songs require.I have been a very big fan since the 50's, despite some of the material she recorded. This is one of two favorites by Teresa Brewer. The other is ""Ridn' High"", an all out big band, jazzy,and very grown up series of dynamite songs.Patrick ByrneOMBRA Records"
5,Must have tool,"It is amazing how much easier this clamp makes assembly of whatever project is at hand. As the title says, this is a must have tool for anyone making pocket hole joinery."
5,I CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW IT WORKS,"THIS TOOL LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULDN'T DO WHAT THEY SAY...BUT IT DOES. THE FIRST TIME I USED IT, IT SEATED THE POCKED DRILLED WOOD PERFECTLY TO THE BASE AND HELD IT WHILE I MOUNTED IT....WHO WOULD BELIEVE IT? I DO NOW."
1,"Didn't work for me, tore up work","I like the Kreg equipment and do lots of pocket hole jointery, so this seemed like a great addition - but it isn't. The trouble is the clamp is very heavy, and is fitting into a small pocket hole. Clamp it too tight, and it blows out the top of the pocket hole, marring your workpeice - and the same can happen if you do not somehow support this heavy clamp. If you do get one, don't use it on any surface that will ever be visable (i.e. a hole you are going to fill with a plug) and don't use it in an area you don't want marred. Pocket holes jointery is simple, efficient, and easy - this clamp is the exact opposite."
4,"They work good, get two and use on a test piece first","These clamps work good in most situations. I prefer to assemble the face frames onto the cabinet base while it's in place. This technique (when possible to actually do, allows for vertical and horizontal alignment of the frame with the adjacent cabinet. I use a 6"" bar clamp to secure the top of the frame and one or two of these to secure the lower corner of the frame for alignment. A couple of pocket hole fasteners installed while the cabinet is in temporary alignment position fixes the location of the frame. I remove the frame and cabinet assembly with the two fixing screws in place. I place the cabinet face down on the floor, on a nice thick cloth and install the remaining screws."
1,Do not buy.....,"This product is WAY overpriced, please do not order from here because you will be getting ripped off by far, this product sells at Nordstrom or [...] for only $36.00!!!Ya thats it! It is an excellent product and I use it as a moisturizer for my face and it smells really good, kind of like cucumber/melon. The product gets 5 stars, the price? Well they dont allow you to give zero stars but that would be my 1st choice"
5,a 1982 club hit!!!,"Although its been over 21 years since this song came out, I still get in the mood to party when I hear this. This group combined funk, rap, and post-disco music into a bad groove!!"
5,Oliver Grant must rescue someone from a lybian jail,"Oliver Grant is an expert on rescuing people. Kristou has just made grant an offer he cant refuse: get kristou's son out of a jail in libya in return kristou will release grants blind sister, or will he? My favorite higgins"
3,great except for timer,"This is a fine product, on the whole. However, I was disappointed in the timer feature. I bought it to use while exercising. Since it has a timer, I thought I could set it for 30 seconds and when it would run out, it would reset to 30 seconds unless I changed it. Unfortunately you have to reset it manually every time. That is fine for some applications, but now I need to buy another new watch. The Timex Ironman has been recommended. I'll try that. But in general, this is a good value."
3,"Good watch, tacky design","This watch looks considerably different than its picture online. The white part around the face is sparkley and the blue is VERY bright. Looks like something you might wear while in your bermuda shorts in Hawaii. The watch itself works great, though it does have the annoying feature of beeping every time you push a button."
4,Great light weight watch!,"I wanted this watch for biking, hiking, and kayaking. I really like it a lot but found it difficult to set as others had mentioned. My engineer husband did it for me. Otherwise- it is fun! Light blue is nice! Came on time."
4,Decent Watch,"I had this watch for a little over a year. I wear it for everything. It gets banged, bumped, and everything else nasty done to it. It still works great with only a few scratches on the face. However, the rubber that holds onto the band broke, so now I cannot wear it. So, if you are more careful with watches than I am, this is a great watch, but be careful with the rubber as it is only a thin piece on each side to hold onto the band."
3,"Cheap watch, does the job","I got this to wear while running. It's certainly not the nicest watch I could find, but this display is very clear, it keeps time well, and the functions (timer, alarm) work. It's nice to find one without a plastic strap, as I find those chafe. The battery has lasted more than a year. I would recommend this, especially for exercise."
4,Timex Women's Sport Watch,I love the watch and it suits me fine. The alarm is difficult to use. I don't need the alarm every day but there isn't a way to leave it off. This is what keeps me from giving a 5 star rating.
1,Poor quality. Button fell out!,Poor quality. Button fell out of mine also and water leeked in. The watch was only week old. Not much of a sport watch. I loved it and was so disappointed. You get what you pay for!
4,it works,It is fine for a casual watch. I have trouble with my band coming undone. I have very small wrists and it is loose on me and tends to come unfastened.
2,Nice but Broke,"It was a nice watch and I really liked it when I first got it. I set the time and put it on. The next morning when I woke up I discovered that the ""set"" button had fallen off at some point. Without it you can't set the time or the alarm, so I returned it."
2,Very confusing.,The watch is cute and water resistant but hard to use. I even tried googling the directions but I couldn't find good help. I wouldn't recommend this watch if you are not tech savy.
4,Nice watch,"I give this item four stars. The only reason it doesn't get 5 is because the strap gets dirty easily and is cloth, so a bit difficult to clean. Other than that, I am pleased w/ my purchase!"
4,Pretty Good Item for its Price,"Overall, this watch is pretty neat. There's one thing that you might want to consider if you're interested in buying this watch - it is very battery-consuming. Three weeks after I got mine, the battery died out. I think this is because it has a night-light, so if you want to conserve your battery life, I suggest that you don't use the light. Other than that, this is a pretty good product for its price - only around $13."
2,Band scratchy!,I bought this watch based on other positive feedback. I got it and put it on and then I took it right back off. The band of the watch is very scratchy and I am not able to wear it for very long. Bad decision!!!!
2,This phone sucks even at this price...,"I thought I would try a dect phone so as to avoid all of the connection problems I was having with my old 5.8ghz. First off, the phone feels cheap. It's SBC branded and even though this phone has a color screen there is no reason why it should. You can't change the screen image or connect the phone to your computer to upload any data. So why a nice color screen? So you can see the SBC logo better? Lame.Second, the number 6 button barely works. Actually, come to think of it, the feel of all of the buttons is super cheap. I can only imagine the rest of the buttons will stop working or in the near future. I am thinking of returning the phone based on the issue with the number 6 button but I've already trashed my box. Anyway, don't buy this phone. It's terrible SBC trash."
3,Flame Too High,"I really like the look of this product but when I lit the lamp, the flame was way too high. I had pulled the coil down as far as possible but the coil would unravel which caused a large flame. I wanted them for the deck posts but I'm too afraid they will start the deck on fire. The other issue is they are very hard to put out. I tried blowing and using a snuffer. I would recommend the company put caps with chains like tiki torches have. I still like the item."
4,Wonderful Lamps!,"These lamps are wonderful. I use them on our patio and have received nice comments on them from friends & family. I liked them so much I've bought them as Christmas gifts this year. The only reason I did not give these 5 stars is they do not come with snuffer caps. I prefer to leave them outdoors all summer and the wicks need protection from rain water. I found some black snuffer caps online and ordered separately. They're not a perfect fit, but they get the job done. If these lamps included snuffer caps they would get 5 stars!"
3,"Well made, but no snuffers and why sets of 3","These are robust and come with extra wicks.Pros:Look goodJust the right size to perch on top of fence or deck posts. (Fasten - eg. staple - the holders down for safety.)Cons:Why sets of 3? Annoying if you need any number not divisible by 3.No snuffers! If you use a candle snuffer on a tiki style lamp it gets messed up with oily soot. Without a snuffer/ wick cover, storage becomes a problem because the wick drops oily black globs all over the place."
5,perfect for outdoor parties,"I organized a beach party, i put them on the table, they looked awesome, and they did not get too hot, it was such a cozy atmosphere."
2,Cheap cheap cheap,"Sorry, but I am not impressed by this Rembrandt fleur de lis charm. Yes, it is sterling, yes, it is a good size for a charm bracelet, but it is hollow-backed, and there is no excuse for this not being solid (at least flatbacked) for the price. It is going back. Keep looking, folks, fleur de lis charms are hard to find, at least solid ones or ones that are the same front to back (as in 3-D), even in New Orleans."
3,Babies are annoying at this age,"So the name of the CD is nice, and totally little boy humour. Oh my, I am so sick of the baby boy voiced bands though. I can't believe people like to listen to this stuff, but to each his own. It's just that you can't take someone who you are picturing standing in his diaper infront of a mike very seriously, and thats a bad thing to music I think."
2,when are they going to grow up,"When people think of Blink 182 they think of mainstream popping punk. This album fits this sterotype exactly. Tom's voice on the album is horrible. The songs all sound the same with the pop Blink 182 sound. This album is not worth your money. Blink 182 is not punk music but mainstreamed, corporate jingles. How old are these guys anyways, they sound like they just hit puberty. This is not for the true punk rocker."
5,One of their best !,One of their best ! I love this album. A must have for blink fans out there! Buy this one !
5,Needed a motivation,"To take off my pants and jacket... loved the cd, found out about songs i wouldnt have had before, very inspiring! :D"
2,NSYNC-182,"If you don't have a drivers license and you like Dawson's Creek, you'll LOVE this CD. If you like creative punk music, I'd suggest going elsewhere. Pre-enema listeners will be in for a big let down.The record industry has taken hold of Mark, Tom, and Travis and made them sound like a bunch of whining babies. They threw in some explicit tunes that'll surely make the kids snicker with delight.I heard two songs that were decent, you may too. That is why I gave it a generous two stars."
4,Could be better,"I personally dont like this one as much as dude ranch and Enima,but thats just what i think.Some of the songs seemed kind of sad.I think this album could be better but i dont regret buying it.I recomend it.what can i say im a fan."
2,Um...,"I have been a really big Blink fan until this cd. After I was finished hearing the whole ablum I was disappointed. This is definetly a change for Blink- whether people want to label it as bad or good. I don't like most of this cd. It's pop rock with a bit of punk popping up here and there (but not too frequently).If you really liked their previous cds like Chesire Cat and Dude Ranch, this cd isn't like them. It has the pop rock feeling of Enema of the State; however, this cd is more mature. This is one of those cds that I have to skip over every other song just to get to something that I wouldn't mind listening to."
2,Pathetically repetitious and nothing original,"After releasing ""Enema Of The State"", Blink 182 has had a sudden surge of popularity among those who had never heard of their MUCH better ""Cheshire Cat"" or ""Dude Ranch"" albums. What seemed to be a unique band, their devoted, earlier followers have ditched them. Why? Because of their releasing of pop-driven, annoyingly repetitious albums like ""Take Off Your Pants And Jacket"".Their strongest point has always been the ability to amuse their listeners. ""Happy Holidays, You Bastard"" isn't a track that makes you laugh like their previous recordings... But just annoys the hell out of the listener by throwing randoms explicitives in here and out there with every change of tone.Blink 182's ""Take Off Your Pants and Jacket"" is not funny, not entertaining, and not in any way unique. Filled with songs that are barely distinguishable from the other, this album should just be one large track. Why separate 'em if they all sound the same??Overall Grade: D-"
3,Say what you will...,"Stay Together for the Kids is going to be huge. Listen to the entire CD -- rantings of the ""pop"" vs. ""punk"" crowd aside, many of the songs here sound all too alike -- and then all of a sudden: what the Hades is this? What an amazing song. Words & music, this one track makes this a CD you'll want to have for the collection. Maybe you actually NEED to be older to appreciate it, but this 41 year old finds herself hanging her head out the car window screaming along. So, this mediocre effort gets elevated to a 3 star purchase on the strength of this single painfully beautiful song. Either buy this CD now or wait for the greatest hits album; this will be their swan song."
3,BLINK TWICE,"Yeah well, I think you guys who give 5 stars are nuts actually. You think about it, Blink's not that hot. A lot of their songs sound very similar, fortunately I think they managed to move away from that quite well with this album. The thing I liked about the album was the witty lyrics even with the explicitness of them. And yeah, some of the songs are good, especially Rock Show, but the albums not really original. That's just my opinion. Bite me if you don't like it..."
3,.................,"When Blink released 'Man Overboard' prior to the release of this album, blink fans must have been happy, because that song is genius, one of their best. if you think the new album mite be something like this, then stop. Im not saying 'Take off your pants and jacket' is a particularly bad album, they have just lost their sharpness and their way of creating catching guitar tunes. many of the songs off the album are pretty lame, and are pretty much just slightly worse versionsof songs offenema of the state. Blink 182 are not a band that should be taken seriously, and pretty much all the time they aren't...but variation is critical.....and without trying to sound like a prick....there is a hell of a lot of swearing in it, that isnt funny or clever. im not saying i dont recommend this album, on the contrary, buy it.....by no means is it awful, its just not as good as many of their previous albums :0("
5,BUY THIS CD NOW! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!,"This cd is by far my favorite cd. This cd is definitly there best yet! If you don't own it, then you missing out on some good music."
3,"Good, but not groundbreaking","Blink is back with 13 new tracks to getcha thrashin'! Those expecting to hear growth from the band will be disappointed. Its pretty much business as usual -- its not bad, just predictable. Their trademark arrpegios, over crunch chords dominate most of the songs. And though funny, not quite as funny as their last release. Recommended...just dont expect the world. (The new Pennywise ""Land of the Free?"" packs more of a punch, and has better lyrics!)"
5,Great CD! Has to be one of their best!,"Take Off Your Pants and Jacket is a very good CD. It has it all. Unique humor (Happy Holidays, You Bastard) and a very serious side (Stay Together for the Kids). You can tell they can sing better, but they haven't lost their punk edge. I think I like Take Off Your Pants and Jacket better than my old Blink 182 favorite, Dude Ranch. I certainly recommend this."
3,Blink 182,"I am not too big on this CD. I liked Blink when they first came out. They showed they had what it took to become a great punk band. In my opinion, their best CD is Creshire Cat. But, after Enema of the State, they have turned away from the punk style. This is a great CD if you like BLink's new style, but if you are a big fan of their early stuff and the punk genre you will be dissapointed"
2,i have a question,"in dude ranch and in chesier cat it sounded like they were having fun doing there thing. now it sounds like there just following the rules of mtv. is blink having fun or are they just tring to make money. if both fine, if just trying to have better, if it is all for the money. (...) another thing is th at the cus so much now. happy holidays is so messed up. overall they changed so much now (...)."
2,this is what happens when you lose sight of the music,"First off, I am a blink fan but even Im not impressed with TOYPAJ. It reeks of some producer at MCA saying ""Yeah thats the next TRL hit right there."" ""Stay toghether for the Kids and ""Story of a lonely guy"" are cases in point. It just feels like its been tampered with too much on a commercial level. I believe this band peaked on ""Dude Ranch."" It blows away EOTS and TOYPAJ. However ""Cheshire Cat"" is thier opus. Its raw,funny, unbridled, gritty and not TRL friendly. I still like Blink I just take smaller doses these days. I just hope they dont repeat themselves (TOYPAJ) and that they begin to write honest songs again ( the track ""a new hope"" off of Dude ranch is a fantastic example) or they might find themselves in the ""Where are you now"" bins in the next year. Of course up and coming bands will wet themselves to acquire Travis if that happens."
2,ugh,"what happened, guys? enema of the state was a masterpiece, this was just a bunch of bubblegum pop songs. ""what went wrong"" is the only decent song on the album and it's only a hidden track! ""feelin this"" is a step in the right direction."
5,This CD rocks!,"I bought this CD on the first day it came out, and was not dissapointed. It has blink's weird sense of humor, of course, especially in the song ""Happy Holidays, You Bastard."" I got the green limited edition cd, which has a bonus track about someone having sex with their own grandfather... which was kind of weird, but funny. They have a couple serious songs too, but mostly it's just the same type of stuff from their other albums. It's good!"
1,I'd rather shove a cow up my ...,"This is the worst thing i could've spent my hard earned money on. Can you please tell me what the hell is going on because if this is the future of music, then just kill me now. I can't believe it's music because to me, it sounds like an elephant on the verge of death. So, as I said in the title of my review, I'd rather shove a cow up my ... without lubrication than listen to this pile of garbage that you lifeless peons call music. God save us all!"
1,you can't get much worse than this,"Green Day=good band, brought something new to the mainstream in '94. I love punk rock. Blink192 is not punk. It's n'sync with guitars. Every song sounds the same. Each single is copy of the last, with the exception of the generic Stay Together For the Kids. Don't waste your money if you like intelligent music, songs with meaning, and something different. my rating is 1 star because you can't go any lower on the scale."
1,don't buy,"I would advise you not buy this cd. I made the mistake in doing so, and most of the other reviews are saying this is their best and most punk cd yet. Although they said that the new cd was going to be faster and more punk, it isnt at all, all the songs sound the same, and the lyrics are terrible. In about every song they swear, and it is not needed and makes the music sound as though it was made for 10-13 year olds who think its really cool to swear and hear swearing. Given that they had 2 years pretty much to make this, I think they couldve made it better musically to be able to distinquish the songs, and better lyrically atleast to make up for the lack of musical talent. There are really only three stand out songs that took them more than 10 minutes to write probably, and those are Anthem Part 2, Stay Together For The Kids and Please Take Me Home. Blink has definitly sold out, and now are trying to even more it seems by only entertaining the 10 year old audience."
1,No good...,"Not even close to Enema! I don't care for there Enema of The State CD,but it is definitely better than this garbage."
1,"dude, this is PUNK","Now THIS is what i call punk. Tom's guitar sounds so hardcore, dude!! I let my punk girlfriend listen to this music, and she started taking off her blouse. Wow, it was fantastic. These guys are the pioneers of punk!! This is the type of music where you feel like you are in Southern California even if you're in Saudi Arabia!! Now i blast this CD in my best friend's VW bug and we go around looking for punk chicks!! I don't care if some spiky haired dude says that blink isn't real punk. Cause blink IS real punk. Now i play in a cover band, and i get more punk chicks than i can handle!! THANKS TOM, MARK, AND TRAVIS!!"
1,sell outs,"this album ranks along brittaney spears and hilary duffsell out musiciansthey were good back in the days of dude ranch and chesire catthat was good punk rocknow their just like the other ones; sum 41, good charolleteuntalented and very boringi wouldve stopped buying their music at ""Enema""wouldnt buy their new one cause i can spot the beat and rythym a mile away"
5,BLINK IS STILL GOOD AS EVER,"Ok let me just say this, I don't care what kind of music you call Blink 182, but what matters is that good punk/rock/poppy sound that Blink has invented. I mean you could call it anything. I call it punk rock with a poppy ryhtm to it. I am a hardcore Blink fan. I have all the albums. I think that the new CD has some of their old sounds and style from their older albums (chesire cat and dude rance) mixed in with a whole new sound of Blink 182. I love the new album, they pick up where they left off with the older albums but with a little twist of Enama of the State to it. I highly recomend buying this CD to any Blink fan. As a drummer, I realize that Travis's parts in this album are extremly talented. Even though it doesn't have as many drum solos, Travis adds a lot of rolls and interludes to rythem that makes the drums sound even better. BUY THIS CD!!!!!"
4,not as good,"ok. im a blink fan, but this cd isn't quite as good as the previous ones. my fav. is probably the mark tom and travis show. in this cd, the guys seem alot more talented, but the lyrics seem a little bit lamer."
4,Best yet.,"With a harder more punk sound than Enema ever was, Blink 182 comes back with an album that does exactly what they wanted: shows their punk roots without giving up any of their high quality sound that makes oldschool punk fans write them off as pop. They sound more together on this than on any of their own stuff, and I would recommend it to any Blink fan. With uptempo and cleverly written hits such as ""Online Songs"" (a personal favorite), it's hard to turn off!"
5,They're growing,"The wanna-be teenagers from Blink 182 have mixed their fast pop brand of punk rock with new and more relaxing, melodious, and reflective guitar taken from the likes Jimmy Eat World.Among the best on 'Take off' are 'Anthem Part Two' and 'Stay Together for the Kids'; both of which are surprisingly striking social commentaries on teenagers today and the devestating effect that bad parenting and divorce can have on today's kids. The guys would do well to make videos for them.Listening to ""Happy Holidays, You Bastard"" and the last song on the yellow cd, I wish Blink would grow up a little. Too much languaage makes this cd one for the parents to think twice about letting your kids listen to.If you can get your hands on the yellow pants digipak, you'll find at the end track 14, a song just as good as any other on the cd."
2,More pop then punk,This wasn't a very good CD in my opinion because Blink sound more pop then punk and i really liked there old stuff and then Enema came out and it wasn't good but it still had a couple good songs. On this one i really only liked one song (anthem part 2) and all the rest was crap. I mean the swearing in it wasn't needed and there was way to much of it. It seemed like a really rushed album and if they had spent more time on it and didn't make it so nsync pop like then it would have been a good CD and mabye they would have had a brighter future. But it seems like they have fallen in to the trap of MTV and they won't ever make great CD's like Buddha or Chesire Cat or Dude Ranch again.
1,What does the 182 stand for?,"One day I saw a car with a Blink 182 sticker on it. Right nest to it was a sticker that said ""No Boy Bands."" I didn't have the heart to tell the driver that Blink 182 was just on the cover of COSMO GIRL!I think all of this pop-punk GARBAGE can be sum(41)med up with this: The other day TRL was on at my friends house. A girl said she was really excited to go to warped tour to see sum41 because she was a big punk fan. When the host asked her if she was excited to see pennywise, she replied, ""who?"""
3,Blink back to thier old selves...not quite.,"For any die hard blink fans out there, you know they sold out when they made EotS. They went from making some of the best punk out there(Dude Ranch) to some weak main stream P.O.S.! This cd they try to get back to thier roots but fall short. THere are a few songs remenisent of the good 'ol days, but they come few and far between popish, TRL style, backstreetboys fans type of music. (...) Buy this cd if you like mainstream pop and/or are a huge TRL fan. Otherwise forget it."
1,WHY?!?!?,why why why did you sell out blink 182? you were so cool in earlier albums such as chesire cat and buddha. Now you've completely lost your little punk-rockishness and have become pop. WHY?!? Don't buy this album unless you like pop. If your a diehard blink 182 fan then download it somewhere. Dont waste your money. This CD is over-editted and only has 2 or 3 decent songs. Please go back to making real punk rock Blink 182. Stop trying to pass off this ...(stuff) as punk. No punk fan should buy this.
4,Take Off And Buy This CD,"Blink 182 have become one of the worlds most popular punk rock bands and with this you can see why. I like Blink 182 I gave this CD 4 stars and I consider this to be their worst album! It is definately worth buying. From the start to the finish their will be a smile on your face becuase alot of the songs are very comical especially ""Happy Holidays, You B*****d"". This is one CD you'll will listen too again and again. Worth buying!"
5,5 Stars because it's hard to diss my favorite band.,"No opinion in this review that hasn't already been said in the 500+ reviews already. Just wanted to say that there are 3 different versions of this cd each with different hidden tracks. One is ""Red Plane""(there is a picture of a red plane on the cd). Its hidden tracks are: 14) Time To Break Up 15) Mother's Day. The other is ""Yellow Pants"". Its hidden tracks are: 14) What Went Wrong 15) [Blank]... A Dog, The last CD is ""Green Jacket"". Its hidden tracks are: 14) When You..[Blank]..Grandpa 15) Hold On. You cannot specify what CD you get when you order it off Amazon..."
2,Mediocre,"Don't let the hype fool you, this album is hardly anything new. Much of it is repetitive and deals with the same topic (love... yawn...) Although you're probobly just buying this because your 13 year old daughter begged you to get it, I recommend you buy some ear plugs with your order this album is: loud, obnoxiously refined (ambience is way too high,) and the vocals are really high pitched... The dirty conotation of the title disgusts me, and the amount of play from songs like 'first date' and 'the rock show' on the radio vexes me. Buy your teen a book instead..."
5,this is the best Blink cd ever,I was a huge Good Charlotte fan and then I finally heard this cd and i absolutly love it. My favorite song has to be the song Online Songs that song is great. Roller Coaster is an awesome song as are all of the others. Track 4 is pretty funny but watch out and make sure your parents don't hear it my mom freaked out and I almost played it around my grandma so be carefull with that one but this cd is awesome and you need to buy it.
5,To A Music Fan who is 30 yrs. that reviewed this album.,"First off this is a great album. Before you critize a band, know all the info. No one in the band is even 30 yet, Mark is 28 and Tom and Travis are 27. Also there are many bands who have older members in it. So they are not even that old, infact you are older than any of them. Also it's kind of hard to listen to Blink when you were 11, since they would be only 8 and 9, and not even in a band. Do us a favor and don't give your opinion anymore. People as stupid as you should be kicked in the junk!"
2,"Definately, NOT Blink's best, but it's worst","The CD is barely ok, it strides away from the true roots of Blink-182, there are some pretty cool songs like Online Songs and Reckless Abandon but after that all the tracks are listenable. If you want to hear some good'ol Blink-182 MUSIC, get Cheshire Cat or Dude Ranch, then you'll really see how bad this CD really is when compared to Blink's other CDs."
4,"Enema of the State all over again, but not as a bad thing","Blink 182 on Enema was not very mature. Same on take off your pants and jacket. Maybe slightly more on their newest release, with the exception of ""happy holidays, you bastard,"" a 42 give or take second long song that barely has any lyrics on the clean cd because it's so explicit. The music sounds very familiar but is still phenominal."
4,maybe 4.5 but now quit there.,"This CD is Good borderline Great. It has good chachy songs, that Blink fans should enjoy. I've been a Blink fan since Dude Ranch, and find it and Take Off Your Pants & Jacket the best CDs that they've done since than. The 3 bonus songs are ""mothers day,"" which is on the one I have plane {red}, F*** a dog which is on the pants CD {green, and when you f****d grandpa being on the Jacket {yellow.} As far as those go get the red, or green one the yellow one is just plain sick. The reason the CD gets the 4 over the higher marks is becuase some of the later songs in the CD sound the same. The best tracks in my oppinion are ""Anthem part 2,"" ""Online songs,"" ""Stay Together For The Kids,"" and ""Everytime I Look For You."" The rest of the songs are all good but I think that those stand out the most."
3,"I give it an emphatic ""eh.""","It's OK, not nearly as good as others have described it. Hardl amazing by any means. Still good though. Better than Enema of the State, but below Cheshire Cat and Dude Ranch. I haven't heard Buddha or the live one so I won't pretend I have. The songs on it are good, but they kind of blnd together at the end. I think they were trying to shed the little kid fans with the excessive swearing, but I didn't mind it. Then again, I'm rarely offended by anything."
4,"Good music, good band, OK Punk","Hey guys, This review is for ""preps"" who think they are punk for listening to this band. Blink have had the torture of being molded pop, and changed back this album. Ok, now, back to the preps, this cd is semi-punk and I listen to Blink cuz of it. Its pop-punk, but if u guys have the nerve to call this ""Real"" punk, I bite my thumb at you. if u didn't get what I said then u never will. Rancids 2001 is real punk. This is a good cd. Anthem Part 2 kicks, just has that cool feel. This cd also disses preps and jocks in this so they get my full love again.Peace"
5,The Best Yet ! Blink Rocks,This is my favorite Blink 182 that has ever came out.I urge you to get this cd. I know what I am talking about I have seen them every time they have came to Chicago. You will love this album.This best cd yet!
2,punk?!,"I'm sorry but if one more person calls this band 'punk' I'm gonna rip out their friggen throat. It drives me nuts. Blink is not punk. They were like 5 years ago, but not anymore.NOTE TO 13 YEAR OLD GIRLS: Punk was not made for you. Punk is not about getting on MTV, making lots of money, and getting girls to love you. Wanna know what punk is? Watch MTV. That is what punk is not. (...)The guys wanted to move on. Thats fine. But it really pisses me off when people ask me what kind of music I listen to. I tell them punk...they assume I'm talking about Blink182, Sum41, New Found Glory, or Fenix TX. Don't insult me. They can play what they want and you can listen to it, I don't care...but don't call it punk."
1,It'll make a good door stop,"Why O Why do the trendy, mind-less masses think this is punk rock? This ISNT PUNK! I REPEAT THIS ISNT PUNK ROCK! This is amazingly horrible music. Damn Mtv for giving exposure to talent-less garbage. DAMN YOU!"
3,Hot & Cold,"Typical Blink... the good stuff is really good, but the bad stuff is really bad. The explicit lyrics on the original version are really a bit much, but it turns out it's no more appetizing without them. Try something consistent, funny, and smart: Danny Blitz and the Jet Age Hoods ..."
3,same stuff but good,"I think this is a pretty tight cd, same as the last one, not as rowdy as the 1st one.I really just wanted to respond to Mr. Josh Yeary... black flag IS cali punk.And this record has the same brattiness as the circle jerks, suicidal tendencies and ESPECIALLY the descendants... some very punk californians."
5,Blink Rocks and thats that!,Only 1 thing I can say the Kickbutta there first 2 albums arent that strong but there last three rock especially this one The anthem(2)is awesome I love Online songs Travis did a very good job wit the drums First date kicks tail HappyHolidays short but Kool A lonly guy its ok The rock show welll yes its been overplayed but still its cool the rest are ok
5,Awesome CD,"This CD is way cool. It was the first Blink CD I ever got and once I heard it, I was hooked. I love the words and I love the sound they produce. Once I fell in love with Blink, I tested Box Car Racer. I loved them too. I know a lot of people who like Blink. I don't know anyone who doesn't like them. This CD is different then most of their CDs. Still good, however."
2,OK WHAT THE HELL,"Ok, calling all fans of Blink 182. They have just made the worst album of theirs ever. it is especially disappointing because enema of the state was such a good album. it had surpassed cheshire cat and dude ranch by far, and they were awesome. so when i got this cd, i was shaking with anticipation. then when i popped it in, the first five songs seemed decent, although not very thrilling. and then it slowly digressed, to the point where i was getting a headache from the terrible music erupting from my speakers. they do have a few good songs on here, but don't expect much more. i say don't waste your money and wait for the hits to come out on some hits collection cd."
3,Blink 182 Take off your pants and your jacket }clean},I think the clean version of this cd is ok. but alot of people woud buy the PA version all i have to say is that they should at least kept so of the song of happy hoildays instead of taking out the whole thing expetfor the last line
2,"Pop? yes, Punk? NO","This CD is perfect for the pop loving person, however, if you're looking for something punk, this CD is not the one you should buy. I highly reccomend Dude Ranch for anyone who wants a more punk sound. its an excellent cd. This, is pop. But, if you do like that kind of music, songs like ""First Date,"" ""Stay Together for The Kids"" and ""Josie"" will give you a good idea of the cd. Its a good cd for a pop loving person, but not one to buy if you want something punk rock."
4,Hmmmmm,"Maybe not the best blink album (dude ranch still does it for me) but some great songs on here! from the silly ( happy holidays u ....) to the serious song stay together (for the kids) wrote about divorce and how it can rip a family in two. Newcomers to the band will love its cheeky songs and smart lyrics whereas old fans will enjoy anthem part 2, either way you should enjoy it."
3,The Title Should be: Blink-182 Punk Goes Pop,"I don't know what the boys from Blink-182 were thinking when they made this album. It is def. not their best work. Heck, it barely meets their average and mediocre work.The songs are still ""fun"" and somewhat fast-paced, but there is a a very pop-music feeling about this album. I was very disappointed in it for the most part.If anyone is paying attention go listen to Buddha, or Chesire Cat, or even Dude Ranch. I think it is safe to say the band has forgotten their punk roots.THIS ALBUM IS NOT PUNK."
3,"Very Very Very POP, sorta punk.","Ok, a word of advice, MTV generally does not play punk anymore.Sum 41- not punk, No Doubt- Not Ska. Sorry. Blink 182 is without a doubt a POP band, because POP means popular. Dude Ranch was a GREAT Pop-Punk CD. Take of your Pants and Jacket is barely Punk. If Blink 182 and Sum 41 is the only Punk you listen to, please don't label yourself a punk rocker, you're not. However, this is pretty good for pop. A few good rifts built this whole CD. However if this is your first taste of Pop-punk, go buy The Movielife""Has a Gambling Problem"",Midtown""Living well is the Best Revenge"", Less than Jake""Hello Rockview"", New Found Glory""Sticks and Stones"", Rancid""And out come the wolves"",MxPx""Slowly Going the way of the Buffalo"". I'm sure you will love them unless you only listen to Blink 182 to look cool. So, conflicted, I gave them a fair 3, 4 stars for a couple good guitar rifts, minus 1 for their sellingout."
5,"uh, it kicks A**","Well, lets see. It take the talent of cheshire cat and the organization of Enema together to make an awesome CD. While other punk bands may decided to complain about things they dont know about (I'm sure one band is probably on the verge of writing a song about starving kids in canada), blink prefers to go the real way, writing songs about things that actually effect them. I'm happy about this CD, because they didn't let fame go to their heads and they didn't make a totally crappy album. Thank you blink, for the album that saved my life."
3,It's pretty good!... for Blink 182,"Well first, I'd like to say Ali's comments below are great. He has very valid points in his sarcasm, and his points are probably funnier than any of the lyrics on Blink's newest album. However, Enema of the State sucked, and if you agree with me, you might just like their new CD. It's pretty decent. I probably won't ever buy it, but some of the songs are worth listening to."
5,Blink all the way!,"If you're a Blink fan like me then you will love this CD! Their new songs are great. I especially like National Anthem Part 2. The hidden tracks are pretty sweet too. If you love Tom, Mark, and Travis you gotta check out this CD!!!!"
5,Don't Hate Them Cuz There Awesome!,"I've loved Blink182 since Cheshire Cat, my favorite CD. I've liked them before they were popular, and I would go to their shows when they weren't popular since they are from my hometown! I must say, there has been drastic change in their sound, and not really for the good. I still love Blink182, and people may call them sellouts, but they always be my favorite band! This CD brings back some of their punk sound, and its good coverup for, ""Enema Of The State."" They are still pop-punk, and may never be punk, but still. So anyways, this CD is really good, not as good as Dude Ranch and Cheshire Cat though. I would recomend this Cd to anybody who wants profanity used way too much, and who enjoy their sense of humor and wanting to be funny, which they are!"
2,Grow up please,"Blink 182 could've done so much with this album they could've tried a little harder to actually care about their music but instead they sold out even more and put out this album which is just an ""Enema of the state part 2"". They have their formulaic pop-punk down to a tee. The fact is most of the songs just sound very childish from guys who are in their late 20's. They are no longer writing good music because they don't have to anymore. They are appealing to 10 year old girls and thats what makes this album suck. They have a few good songs but there are too many duds. The few good songs include ""Story of a lonely guy"", ""Rock show"", ""online songs"". Even on these semi-good songs they sound like their 13 years old. I wish they would take a nod from Green Day and try to pretend they are over 18 at least."
4,Put on ur pants and jacket and buy this cd!!,"Okay, I wanted to buy a cd. I was thinking about Blink 182, Sugar Ray or Missy Elliot. I brought ""Take Off Your Pants And Jacket"" by that punk/pop band Blink-182. Am I Happy with my choice? YES. I ran out to buy this Blink-182 cd because they rock, and this cd rocks. I didnt expect anything less from Blink-182 because they always deliver catchy, thrashing, and overall good rocking tunes. Personally, my favorite Blink Cd is still a toss up between ""Dude Ranch"" and ""Enema"" but this cd has the potential to be my new fav. so Put On Your Pants and Jacket and buy this CD!!"
2,Probably the worst blink cd,"I really liked Dude Ranch, Cheshire Cat, and Buddha, but TOYPAJ just doesn't live up to those. Sure, Mark is still a bad bass player, Tom still can't sing, and Travis is the only one with talent, but their music isn't nearly as good. They were probably overtaken by money right before Enema of the State by a new record label and were bribed to do more pop music. The good thing is this is a bit better then Enema was. I enjoyed songs 9-11. Everything else I can't really stand. ""Online Songs"" is basically the new ""All the Small Things"" It takes that same sort of kiddie punk sound and adds in the na na na's and all that other lame stuff. ""First Date"" is also pretty lame and just shows that they can do better then they are doing. Blink, I'm ashamed of you and wish that you hadn't sold out and that someday you'd come back as a real punk band again."
1,What happened to being a punk band?,"So a couple years back there was a PUNK band called Blink 182 who brought out a pretty sweet album by the name of Cheshire Cat. Fast forward a couple of years and they've transformed into a pop/boy band, the only difference being they have some guitars and a drum set. Along the way somewhere they decided to trade in their musical integrity for money. These guys are the ultimate sellouts and their sound proves it. They are now a broken record playing high school hijinx, girlfriends and potty humour over and over and... Do yourself a favour and don't buy this album, and if you like the sound buy Enema of the State, it's pretty much the same thing."
4,Blink 182 is Back and Better than ever,"I am a fan of all different kinds of music, and this album is one of my favorites. It has humerous songs, fast songs, and awsome lryics. The overall album is great to listen to and even though it has swearing, it's still a wonderfull CD. They covered every aspect grealty, except for there were no slow, or softer songs, like Adam's Song from their previous album, Enema of the State. Even so, I would reccomend this album to anyone!"
4,Yay!,"This is a really fun cd! I like almost all of the songs. ""Reckless Abandon"" and ""Happy Holidays are kind of funny, but they get old fast. Over all, though, this cd is one of my favorites, ""Roller Coaster"" being my favorite song. This cd is full of energy and is great to listen to when you're trying to get ready in the morning, or when you get home from work (or school).Note to parents: Don't let your 8 year old listen to this. The subject matter and language are not appropriate."
2,Missing something,"I bought ""Take off your pants and jacket"" thinking it was going to be a great album like ""Dude Ranch"" and ""Enema of the state"". Boy was I wrong this album has nothing on it that stands out as a great song, eccept maybe ""The Rock show"" and "" Stay together for the kids"". I have4 four words for the blink fans. If you must have this album please buy it used because it really isnt worth the market price."
4,Blink 182 album,"This is one of my favorite albums, but gets very similar due to the guitar doing the same stuff EVERY time. First Date, Reckless Abandon, and Please Take Me Home, are awesome because the drums, bass, and lead guitar are different every one of the songs. First Date especially is like they finally stoped being s*** heads and went back to the funny lyrics, but gr8 rocking.The rest are good but it feels like they used it for filler. The worst song on there is The Rock Show. It sounds like it was made ONLY 4 MTV and was pulled out Liberatchi's A$$. NEVER,I repeat,NEVER download this song. Enema was funny and had gr8 songs. If Blink had put more time in to this one it could have been platinum. Recomended downloads:Sum 41: Fat Lip, In too deep,pieces.Green Day: minority, American Idiot albumGoldfinger:99 red balloonssee ya"
4,same old stuff,"yes this sounds awful familiar beacuse of the nations infatuation with generic pop-punk bands. its still good though because well hey....its blink 182. they were the first band i listend to. alot of reveiws say that ""give me one good reason"" is the best song and that they lyrics are very true...well to those kids...grow up. stop rebelling against your parents and thinking they dont understand you. they were in your shoes about 30 years ago. they konw what you feel like. if you feel like rebelling against somthing make it be the US government. (at least for me) yea well im out."
2,"I SAY DON'T TAKE YOUR JACKET AND PANTS OFF, TAKE THIS CD OFF","Blink 182 is back with ""Take Off Your Pants & Jacket"". Which in my words is NO ""Enema of the State.This album feels rushed, the songs are so-so except for the first single ""Rock Show"". 15 songs are on this album and 14 are fillers.This is what happens to a band when they have great effort that is critically and financially a success. The record label puts demands on the band to rush out another album, FAST!....and what we get is ""Take Off Your Pants & Jacket"", which graphically is a very polished cover which does NOT represent Blink 182 and nor does the music inside.Blink 182 has lost it on this album. It is not a bad album, it is just ordinary.This album is NOT impressive, or great it is ordinary. I am still playing ""Enema of the State"" today, as for ""Take Off Your Pants & Jacket"" it is going back on my CD rack.A disappointment."

1,Give me a break...,"Are you as sick of this pop-punk garbage as I am? I know I'm really sick of it (not to mention nu-metal and this new post grunge sensitive trash), but Blink 182 is sure grating on my nerves more and more. I never liked Blink 182 to begin with, even before they became MTV puppets, but this album is undoubtadly the most uninspired made for radio wanna be punk music I have ever heard. What gets me even more are the kids who think that this is what real punk rock is, and this isn't was punk rock is; real punk rock are bands like The Ramones, Dead Kennedys, old Misfits, Suicidal Tendencies, or even NoFX, not this uninspired repititious garbage. If you want a real punk rock experience, try those bands, and leave Blink 182 where they should be: in the dirt."
5,Blink's Best Work,"This Cd has been getting trashed by all of the Dude Ranch lovers. In my opinion this Cd is sending them towards a new more mature sound which is good. This CD is filled with serious songs like Anthem Part II, which tells how the government oppresses the youth, and Stay Together for the Kids, which is about divorce. Despite their more mature songs there are still joke songs like Happy Holidays, You Bastard. Overall I say that this CD is amazing and Blink's best work."
3,sheesh...immaturity as its best..,"well...i will admit when i first popped in the cd in the player i enjoyed it...for the first half...then i was turned off..i couldn't really sit down and listen to this cd.its just way too immature....they need to get with the program.i mean, don't get me wrong. they're a good band, as in they play their instruments well and some of their songs have catchy lyrics but i think most of the band members are over 23 yet they haven't arrived to the point of maturity yet. we understand for dude ranch and enema of state but come on...grow up..that's all i'm sayingnot to mention the title of punk rock is just wayyy off on this cd....it should be pop rock.."
2,"I'm cursing at a 10th grade level!!!! Oh wait, I'm 30","AHHHHHH!!!! AHHHHHHH!!!! BLINK 182. WHEN WILL YOU GROW UP!!!But seriously, this isn't music. Three 30 year old men (or are they older now)stringing random curse words together, or at their best, singing about rebelling against their parents, is sort of pathetic. It's obvious they are targetting a younger crowd. I'll admit, when I was 11, I enjoyed their music, but to even suggest they are a good band is a joke. I wouldn't be surprised to find that they have it in them to create real music, but until they do, don't patronize this band by buying their material."
3,A bit harsh,"This CD sounds very much like previous Blink 182, however, the language is a bit harsh. Now...I am as hip as the next guy and use that langauge myself, but this seems excessive and unnecessary. Some of the songs were outright offensive. The lyrics are explicit and the CD would be ranked an 8 out of 10 if they just didn't use the foul language. It really is not COOL to say the F word! The songs really don't need it."
5,its great...and i met them.,"This is one great cd!!! im not saying its the new cheshire, but its pretty great. best tracks are 1,2,3,4,6,8,10,11,12, and 13 is amazing!! its one of the bst trax from these guys<a great band> ever. also, the hidden tracks are pretty good on the ""jacket"" and ""pants"", i still gotta get ""airplane"". and...MY COPY IS AUTOGRAPHED BY MARK TOM AND TRAVIS BECAUSE I GOT TO MEET THEM, AND THEY ARE SOOOO COOL IN PERSON!!!buy it"
3,not bad at all but not the masterpiece that is enema!!!,"i bought this cd on release day and expectations were big. after the huge success of breakthru album, enema, this was always going to be a hard followup.well, im slighlty dissapointed with take off ur pants and jacket. its not that the album is lacking quality songs. quite the opposite: anthem part two oozes class, stay together for the kids is also high up there, but the highlight of the album has to be in my opinion, story of a lonely guy. the remainder of the album is standard pop/punk filler. am i the only person that dislikes the rock show??? it reminds me of all the small things from enema(another song that i was never to fond of)but im sure itll be a no 1 hit neway!!unfortunately i feel the album is lacking that special something that separates a good album from a classic album. dude ranch has it. enema has it. take off ur pants and jacket, sadly does not. still im sure most blink 182 fans will love this album, so get get it quick!!"
3,Green Day Revisited,"The good thing about bands like Blink 182 is that the energetic guitars and drums and the joyful-boyish vocals create catchy rock music. The downside is that it's the same over and over, song for song - they're hard to distinguish. So, like it's the case for Green Day and The Offspring albums, one entire album is too much. A few good songs spread here and there is better. A very typical song of this genre is the opener 'Anthem Part Two'. It is not bad at all but very typical, like a cliché. Tracks 2 and 3, 'Online Songs' and 'First Date', are nearly identical though and had better been left out. The best song on 'Take Off Your Pants And Jacket' is the SLIGHTly more sensitive 'Story Of A Lonely Guy'. Other highlights (or rather: 'slightly-above-standard-lights') are the hit single 'The Rock Show', 'Please Take Me Home' and the two more varied and artistic 'Give Me One Good Reason' and 'Stay Together For The Kids'. But... a couple of songs or maybe two would really have done it..."
3,its not punk but its not bad,"there are two completely different kind of blink-182's. flyswatter, cheshire cat, and dude ranch are the old, punk blink-182. enema and take off your pants are the pop-punk newer version of blink. as sad as i am that blink's new music isnt punk, the cd isnt bad. although there are a couple of songs that make me wanna see how far i can throw the cd (the rock show, stay together for the kids, roller coaster), there are some songs that are an improvement from enema (anthem pt 2, reckless abandon, happy holidays you bastards). and for tom to say that this is their most hardcore album ever he must not have been there when they recorded some of the songs. ""roller coaster favorite ride, let me kiss you one last time"" i dare you to find a lyric like that in dude ranch. but despite my disappointment in the bands new type of music...some of the songs are enjoyable enough for me to give the cd 3 stars"
2,"Eh, not so great","Ok now I have liked blink182 ever scince i first heard chercrie cat (ok i spelled that wrong) and i have liked most of thier other cds but this one cant match up with any of the other super cds this band has put out. For some reson the first time I listened to this album I felt something was missing, what it is, i dont know but it just irritated me. Id much rather watse my money on enema or any of their other cds."
5,"Great album, but not the best...","Yeah, blink's never gonna be like they use to be, real punk, this is still a punk album though. It's got the final blend of punk in it.Headline:Blink's Punk album sells big. Enama was much too poppy (All the small things, Whats' my age again) But this time around there's the punk there and it sells. Athem || is great, so many songs are great on this album. It's one of the best so far made by Blink.Whatever genre blnk is, there a great band."
3,3 Stars Actually,"I have mixed feelings about this CD. Overall, i think it is better than most of their previous CDs (I say most!). However, some of the songs are weak. If you really listen to the lyrics, they sound childish, but the sound is great. Thank God they didn't do another live album!"
4,A guilty pleasure,"I do enjoy Blink 182's music and was compelled to endure the hassle of writing a review after reading some of the other entries.In short, Blink 182 writes fun rock tunes and anyone over the age of 17 should consider the purchase of any the band's albums a guilty indulgence.Comparisons to bands like the Sex Pistols are completely out of place. That was over 20 years ago and there is absolutely nothing shocking about modern punk rock music. Sid Vicious was a heroine addict and was more valuable as a symbol than a musician. The bassist for Blink 182 sings and plays, musically.And any time I see a review from someone claiming to have been there ""back in the old days"" I cringe. Blink 182's music has not changed at all since they started. It's fun now and it was fun then. It bothers me to see punk rock kids wasting their anger on debates about credibility. Blink 182 has recorded jokes about making dogs drink pee. This is not a band to be debated.Thanks for your time."
4,great stuff from blink,"The songs from ""Take Off Your Pants and Jacket"" was the stuff that really put me into Blink, so i haven't been a fan since they started. But now i know my blink backround, and while everyone says TOYPAJ is too poppy, it is still awesome material. There's no song on here which i wouldn't mind listening to for hours straight, the only exception being Give Me One Good Reason, which gets irritable. I will admit, i think Dude Ranch is a better album than this, but this is a superb effort from blink. I'm a punk rock fan, and i have no problem with the stuff on this cd. and while i will agree i wish they did less close partnerships with M""hop onboard any trend going on right now""TV, they're videos are awesome and they never cease to make me laugh. So while i'd love them to retrace their roots back to Dude Ranch, i wouldn't be angered at all if they kept this shtick going."
3,They're trying,"Just recently have I started liking Blink. I still don't like them that much though. I got ""TOYPAJ"" hoping it would be really good, but it's not. Blink 182 is just a sell out band really wanting to Green Day, who in my opinion are a million times better. Here is my song by song review of Blink's latest album:1. Anthem Part Two- Better than Anthem part one2. Online Songs- To messy, badly written, badly sung3. First Date- We can all relate to this one4. Happy Holidays, You Bastard- Oh My God.HAHAHAHA5. Story Of A Lonely Guy- The best on this album6. The Rock Show- Good vid, too overrated7. Stay Together For The kids- Sad8. Roller Coaster- bad9. Reckless Abandon- FunnyThat's as far as I got. Overall, not very good, too poppy, they need to think punk and they could be VERY good."
3,"Good if you like sell out pop ""punk""","I used to like Blink 182. They were the first band I listened to that I thought was ""punk"". Then I discovered other bands instead of them, like Green Day, which isn't entirely punk either, but they got good music. Pass blink by. This album is good if you like Blink's new sissy Pop feel."
5,blink still going strong,"Mark,Tom, and Travis continue to keep it punk in their newest album ""Take off Your Pants and Jacket"". If ever a play on words discribe a album this is it. Although this album leans more toward thier punk sound than some work of theirs in the past it still maintains that, ""the hell with what everyone else thinks"", ""have a good time"" attitude. After five albums and numorous apperences on that devils advocate of a show, TRL one would think the temptation to sell out would be so overwhelming 3 guys from Cali whould have buckled by now. Not true. This album is not a ""Cheshire Cat"" or a ""Budda"" but it represents the punk community while at the same time not taking it self to seriously. Evidence of this is obvious in the track ""Happy Holidays You Bastard"". Any band that can make me laugh on one track and jam on another is alright by me. Rock on Blink."
5,Surprisingly Good,"Before I got this CD I did really think that Blink 182 was just an MTV pop punk TRL band, but I was very surprised that the songs are very good and the lyrics are actually very meaningful, because I did expect this album to be alot of filler, and none of it is.People say that Blink 182 has sold out or that they aren't really punk, but whether that is true or not, what's really important is the music. Like other people have said, if this music was done by NOFX, Rancid, or any ""real"" punk band people would love it, but just because it's by Blink, elite punk fans automatically think it's sold out and bad, which is not true at all.Bottom line is, if you just listen to this album without judging it from what you THINK it will be, judge it from what it IS, which is simply great music.My favorites are Anthem Pt. 2, Shut Up, Please Take Me Home, Stay Together For The Kids, Story of a Lonely Guy, and Give Me One Good Reason is one of the best Blink songs ever."
5,Their best album,"Musically and Lyrically, this is their best album by far. Although it does not follow a traditional punk style, it is still their best! Trust me!"
3,not the best...,"I'm a huge Blink-182 fan, but I must say I'm disappointed in their new CD. It's not as edgy and punky as Enema of the State. Don't get me wrong, it's a good CD, but not nearly as good as their other CDs. If you are a die-hard fan of the blink boys, you might enjoy the CD, but otherwise, stear clear."
4,awesome,i think its the best blink 182 cd yet. if your a fan of blink 182 GET THIS CD. I have all the others this is my faveroit of all.its tight.
5,Wow,"This CD is simply awesome. While it does lose a small amount of the punk style found so much in Enema Of The State, it is still great. Rock Show is fun and by the second hearing, you'll be singing right along with Mark and Tom. Great songs like First Date and Roller Coaster make this a very worthwile CD. Buy it. Now. What are you waiting for? Well? BUY IT ALREADY!"
3,Not punk but thats ok in my book,"Well blink was never really PUNK but thats ok it is a ok cd with some good songs. If you want to listen to punk buy NOFX, or Edna's Goldfish. Some other good bands are Catch 22, Choking Victim, all in all i give it 3 stars. Best song is Shut Up."
2,not quite,"I read a review earlier that said ""if you call this pop then you have no idea what pop sounds like"" pop is short for popular, and blink 182 sure has gotten there. Aside from a few gems, Online Songs and the hidden Hold on, this album is an overproduced wreck. I read from an interview with the guys that this is their hardest album yet, it would be more raw then the last..either they lie or they have really really bad contracts. Some call this cd evolution but i just cant see it. Im glad that it was number 1 on the billboard chart and i wish blink the best for their continued success, and i will for sure be seeing them when they come through here this summer, but i will be skeptical before buying their next cd. If you trust me you will go buy the new Stone Temple Pilots instead."
5,blink's best cd hands down,"blink has produced only 3 really good cd's in my opninon. I'm not really into there older stuff, but Enema of the State, Take Off Your Pants n Jacket, and Mark, Tom, And Travis Show are really there only great cds. However, this on is there best. The best songs are: Anthem, Pt. 2; First Date; Happy Holidays; Rock Show; Reckless Abandon; and of course F*** A Dog... I highly recomend it"
3,Blink has Blinked Out,"Blink is just simply getting old now, some of the songs are good, I like ""online songs"" ""shutup"" etc, but others just get annoying and repetative. I haven't heard a good song like ""Dammit"" or like ""Adams Song"" on this album, so I found it hard to even give it a 3/5. Is it worth buying? No it isn't, I believe this cd is just plain old. They have done nothing new and barely even tried with this cd, plus the three songs they made videos for, ..., in my honest opinion"
2,The only reason I don't hate it is because it is Blink 182...,"Well It stated that this was the version with the bonus song ""What Went Wrong"". It is the only reason I bought it! But it has ""Mothers Day"" instead. Frustrating!"
4,Not punk but very catchy pop,"This is reasonably close to real pop punk, but the corporate distribution and wayyyy to shiny production put in squarely in the pop section. But hey, it's still a really fun listen, replete with almost instantly hum-able melodies that make this music great. Just don't buy this and think you're some kind of punk or rebel because you will be a total poser. For real pop/punk with an honest basement/DIY attitude get Crimpshrine and some early Jawbreaker. Without those two bands Green Day and Blink would have never even existed."
3,My first and probable the worst,"This is the worst of the blink cd's, it's still an great cd.but if u want the best of them all go to enema or Cheshire cat.it's got alot of good stuff on it, but if you want blinks best,this isn't it......"
2,this is a horrible recording,"i remmeber back in the day, ahh good ol chesher cat... this makes buddha look great now buddha was a ok cd but not greatmy best friend owns this cd and i have listened to it many times, but everything except track 6-rock show are space fillers, especially the extra tracks for the take off-your pants-and jacket albums are pure ..., the excessive cursing is stupid and i HATE this"
1,smell it from here,"blink 182's ""Take off your pants and jacket"" is one of the worst releases from this or any band to date. I am being generous with the one star The only saving grace is The Rock Show"
1,trash,"If you want punk.. go buy some RAMONES. If you want Rock, go buy some KISS. If you want some teenie bopper radio music buy Blink-182. Period.This album is terrible.. just like every one they put out before it and every one they'll put out after it. I am also dismayed that every 11 year old in my hometown seems to have at least 3 copies of this sugar coated [stuff]. It's really a shame that people can get rich off this ""music?"".If you want to buy a CD.. I might suggest one of the first four Ramones albums that are sold on this very website. You'll thank me later for recommending them."
1,The overplayed fartsmiths are back. Joy.,"Looks like more time went into thinking of the album's title then into coming up with the music. Simply horrible. Songs blend into each other, indistinguishable and pedestrian. All that's left now is for Blink 182 to have a VH1 Behind The Music special and we'll be done with them. Good Riddance, posers."
1,CAN YOU SAY N*BLINK?!,"HELLO?! I used to like blink, cheshire kicked and dude ranch was funny, there concerts rock. And then there was enema and now this! OH MY GOSH! They have completely turned pop and i am embaressed to say i have this CD."
4,Not as good as others,"This album is okay, but the lyrics are weak. First time Blink listeners should buy Dude Ranch."
5,AWESOME!!!!!,"I've never been more excited about an album in my life and this one delivered MORE than I expected. It won me over with Anthem Part 2 and Please Take Me Home. The Bonus Track is hilarious and makes you look forward to it. Blink 182 delivers in this much anticipated album and it will be spinning in my CD Player for the rest of the summer. Even though they have been labeled as a sellout band, they still stay true to 'Enema' and their punk past."
5,PURE GENIUSES ...,"They've done it again! This CD rocks and probably will have just as many radio hits as their last work of art ""Enema of the State."" Their CDs magically pick you up when you're down or in a bad mood. Their hillarious lyrics keep you laughing. This is a must have for all Blink 182 fans!"
3,Let's Get Real....,"First of all, this album is not better than the last one. I don't care how many of you say it is, reality is, this album isn't better than Enema. But still, this is a good cd. If you're a big Blink fan you'll love it. If you're the type that barely got into Blink because of all the pop songs on Enema, you will be disappointed. Still, this album shows more talent than a lot of other cds out there. The songs aren't as catchy as in Enema, they're more hardcore. Enema was a big seller and i think this cd is too hardcore to sell as many as Enema. But if you're looking for a good rock album, look no more. For all the Enema fans out there, im sure you would've loved for Blink to keep their Enema style, but they didn't. It's only natural for a good band to progress to different styles of doing their music."
5,Blink is back and better than ever!,"I have waited for this cd to come out for months. And im not dissapointed in it. Its one of my favorite cds. Rock show, please take me home, reckless abandon, and anthem part 2 are my favorite songs. Every song on the album is great. The cd has great guitar riffs. Tom has gotten alot better with the guitar.And Travis is amazing on drums like always. They also have more serious songs. Anyone that likes punk or not should go out and buy this cd! You wont be dissapointed."
4,pretty good,"this cd won't make any people who didn't like blink start liking them,and some people might put it down because of how good enema was- it's more for people who like them already. a lot of the songs on this cd has a similar pattern to them. they don't watch there language at all on this cd...especially in ""shut up"" they swear about every other word. all the songs are good tunes.but no smash hits( like adams song and small things were"". i also noticed throughout the cd there were a couple cords i heard before on there previous cd's. i don't have a favorite song or worst song on the cd yet( listened to each song about twice except rock show more cus of radio) at this point to me i think enema is better for the reason of they varied songs patterns around. all they vary for most of this cd is the pace they echo the chorus words-but again they're all good tunes."
5,A+++++,Take Enema of the State and times it by two and you have this CD. It's Great! I went out and bought it today when it came out. Best 20 dollars I ever spent!! Go out and buy this CD if you didn't already.
5,"I dont care how poppy this album is, i like it","I've listened to this album, and i like it. Blink 182 partially fuels my desire to learn guitar because some of the songs are just fun to play. And to all the people flaming blink for being sellouts. WHO THE HECK CARES?! Though it may seem a bit commercialized, blink is still producing high quality music, and thats all i care about. We are reveiwing the MUSIC on this album and not the band overall, right?"
5,Love it!,Blink 182 keeps up with their hillarious lyrics and great tunes in this cd! It's a must buy for any fan!
4,I THINK BLINK IS GOOD...BUT GREEN DAY IS BETTER,"The new Blink 182 CD is good. I think is a combination of enema & dude rach. These guys are some funny dudes. There are a couple wacky songs. Then there is another one very reminisant of ""adam song""...Blink is one of my favorite bands. But I think Green Day's Wanrning is a much better all around album."
5,A great CD,"This CD had a number of good songs, including ""Anthem Part Two"", and ""Reckless Abandon."" I think it is much better than there last CD, and most of the songs have a good, jumpy beat."
4,What a perfected Enema of the State could've been.,"TOYPAJ is the latest, and one of the best Blink albums. This is tied with Dude Ranch as the best Blink disk to date in my opinion. This is what they where trying to do with Enema, but I imagine they where still trying to perfect themselves with Travis when that album was releaed. TOYPAJ has some really great songs, the only downers are ""Stay Together for the Kids"" and ""Please Take Me Home."" The lyrics are somewhat corny in First Date, but besides that (and Happy Holidays) this album's content is somewhat more mature than that of Enema. The best song is Anthem Pt.2, which is a lot better than the first anthem and is destined to be a hit. All the other songs are really good and pretty much anything off of this could be a hit. Definately reccomended to all Blink-182 fans."
4,"I'm not a BIG punk fan, but I like it.","I got the Blink 182 cd that was edited because I don't apperciate bad language. I like punk a lot, especially the Christian punk bands, the rule! I only like one song on this cd anyways, so I give it a four star rating. Blink 182 is really cool, but they would be a lot cooler if they didn't use obscene language."
1,Can someone please cry Sellout!,"topher 1 has no idea what punk rock is. Blink 182 are the biggest sellouts i have ever heard. If you want punk rock listen to Rancid, GBH, Dead Kennedys, Vandals, H2O, Bouncing SOuls,Misfits or pennywise. Blink is not a punk band. There has never been a punk band that has been nominated for any MTV award. There never will be. Punk Bands do not need major labels, MTV, or Radio play to establish themselves. THey need their own talent. Blink 182 have established that they have none. They are an insult to everything punk stands for. THey have proven themselves too be more like Backstreet Boys with guitar. Come forward and say you're alternative."
4,forget the purists,"There are alot of ""punk purists"" who wont listen to blink just because they have made it into the main stream (namely PunkRawkKing who has reviewed this cd). there are some reviews from people like this who give it a low rating solely for this reason. these are the same people who were lapping up cheshire cat and dude ranch when they first came out (thats if theyre old enough). EVERY BAND PROGRESSES!! get over it.anyway now that is all said and out of the way, id just like to comment that this is a very good album and im sure you will enjoy this if you can get past the fact that theyve been on mtv a few times."
3,A little overrated,"To say that this is their best album to date is an overstatement. This album is a continuation of Blink's punk to pop trend. This is by no means a return to Dude Ranch, Buddha, whatever. The drums barely reach punk level on any of the songs, and the chorus's (for the most part) are radio rock melodies. This is not to say that it's a bad album, I don't regret picking it up, and I have enjoyed listening to it. The chorus on ""Stay together for the kids"" is as good as anything Blink has done before. I think the problem is that there are really no punk songs to balance the album against the more pop tunes. There are no songs like ""Dumpweed,"" ""Dysentary Gary,"" or ""Anthem"" (Anthem II is a completely different song) on this album. Those songs coupled with the rest of Enema are what make it a better album. Not a great album but a good one."
5,Pretty cool CD,"What a Great CD! If your a Blink Fan, you'll love this. There seems to be a few more slower songs than Enema, and a bit more serious to. Anyway, great CD, great deal!"
3,Three stars for only three good songs...,"This cd stinks compared to blink 182's oldschool stuff... so, my advice would be to ""take off your pants and jacket"" to this cd.. it blows."
2,Just Plain Terrible,"I bought this CD with high expectations (probably way too high) and I was very disappointed. Every song is so similar to the next. The lyrics are simple and stupid. And now I'm starting to ramble, so I'll shut up."
4,Blink is back,"This is one of those CDs that a punk-rocker hates to admit they love.. Green Day, Blink-182, NOFX, and Pennywise are my favorites but this CD is cool! I prefer the old Blink-182 but come on this CD isn't bad.. If you like Enema Of The State by Blink and you like bands like Sum-41 and Fenix TX, get this CD. I'd give it 4 1/2 stars if it was optional."
2,Blink or Britney,"These guys only want the money, their music is so popular that even a 15 year old Britney fan loves it"
3,"Not Enema, but ok...","This installment from the Naked Guys seems to me to be a bit weak; the only real hit I hear off this CD is ""Rock Show"". In some ways, this album parallels Men at Work's Cargo, the follow-up to Business as Usual. Even though it didn't have the hits on it that Business as Usual had, it was actually a damned good album, in some respects better than the former. I'll have to listen to this disc some more to confirm Blink's Jacket-to-Enema parallel, but I wouldn't be surprised if that is my final conclusion. That said, upon early listening of ""Jacket"", I'm a little disappointed; it sounds like the band was in a big hurry to capitalize on their popularity by quickly releasing a new album on the heels of the success of Enema. Time will tell..."
1,a little harsh,ok 1 stars is a little harsh but to be fair its not a patch on enema of the state.a does however contain at least a couple of songs you'd listen to over again but nothing really like aliens exist or whats my age again?. its seems like there trying to hard this time around.still if your under 13 and want a good introduction to alternative musics this is as good a place to any to start
1,Good Punk Gone Bad,"Blink182 was an incredibly good band, 5 years ago. From the underground releases of Cheshire Cat and Buddha, they made a smooht transition to the mainstream with Dude Ranch, and still didn't lose much. However, with Enema of hte State, they had lost all respectability. Continuing with Enema's trend of skin-deep lyrics, poppy melodies that someone who doesnt play could learn to play in less than an hour (see MTV Becoming), and a style of music that is an incredibly warped version of pop punk that resembles NSync more than any respectable punk band. They have gone from respectability to a boyband who writes and performs their own music, to their credit. But the effect is a horribly generic CD that is mostly filler space and lyrics that could have been written in record time ""I can't wait for the warped tour..."" Blink182 has lost its fan base and found a new one, and a common link with the Backstreet Boys in the pre-adolosecent, pre-pubescent, boy crazed girl"
5,Blink 182 Sellouts? Hell no!,"Ok, let me start out by saying that this is Blink's best CD by far... I am going to say that Blinks CD Enema of the State was aweful and only had a few good songs, therefore that album was a sellout. However, Blink realized this and decided to make a change. This album was the change. The vocals and guitar are unlike anything they have done! Yeah, it's true that Blink's lycris don't change that much but who cares? This CD reminds me a lot of Dude Ranch, even writing a song about Josie (Online Songs) and more of the punk kind of music and barely any pop. Some of the songs were actually heavy ( Shut Up, Stay Together for the kids). The CD also contains funny songs ( Reckless Abandon, Happy Holidays, and The Dog Song). I think that Blink has changed a lot and has matured in this album. I am also saying that the lyrics are extremely explicit... I'd like to thank Blink for publishing an awesome cd. GREAT JOB BLINK!"
1,"The absolute least listened to album I own, by far","I used to listen to blink 182 quite often. In fact, they are the first band I listened to that could possibly be considered punk. As soon as I purchased this album, I was disgusted and have not since listened to blink 182. Even enema of the state was OKAY, but not only this album pure trend, but the music is actually just plain BAD. Its like they desperatly needed an album so they got together and made this one day. Personally, the only reason I believe anyone to like this album is to be ""cool"" and have friends. If you are really looking for good music then I would suggest ANY Bad Religion album. The worst Bad Religion song is by far better than any song on Blink 182s TOYPAJ, and would be a great band to become accustomed to real punk rock music with."
1,BLINK (...),"Don't even know why my friend gave me this cd. I dont even like Blink that much! For all you people who say ""oh yeah its a great punk cd"", you are messed up. THIS IS NOT PUNK! ITS BUBBLEGUM-PUNK! Its barely music. They just sit there strumming 3 chords and singing in high pitched voices and think they're cool. THEY HAVE NO GUITAR TALENT WHATSOEVER. They're drummer is...not bad, but that doesnt make him cool. If you want to listen to real talent and not the brainwashed popular stuff, get some metallica, testament, megadeth, etc. You know...real music."
1,their worst cd,"im a huge blink 182 fan, and this just might be their worst cd ever. second to a good charlotte cd of mine, this by far the worst album i own. do not buy this cd. the only good song is ""online songs,"" and its not worth the $15 or whatever it is."
2,I won't take off my pants for this album,"I would rather listen to this album than Britney Spears, Christina Agulaira, Avril Lavigne etc. any day of the week, but Blink 182 are sold out, and I think they made this album to please MTV. They don't care about making punk music anymore, they just want to make money, and I don't blame them, but that's what this album is. And the problem is, once you're mainstream, there's no going back. I'm sure at least 8/10 of you who like this album also like pop music, music that gets lots of radio play. If you want some 'real' Blink 182, buy Budha and Cheshire Cat, which are good punk albums, or Dude Ranch, a great pop-punk album.R.I.P. Blink 182"
3,Huge Disappointment,"Blink was good back in the day before they sold out, and this album was supposedly gonna bring back their punk backround...but it was a disappointing release as it is just as poppy as enema, if not more, so if u like sell-out pop, then i recommend this to you"
5,BLINK IS NOT A POP BAND!,"although many of the reviews say blink 182 is a pop punk band and that blink 182 is just an alternative boy band, uhhh NO! lets compare shall we. First of all boy bands dont play instruments there just preatty much untalented money makers that are most listened to by 10 year old girls and ppl wit IQ'S around 6 they cant sing at all. OK and then theres blink guys that actuly sing and play instruments very well i might ad and acctuly can gather so many different types of ppl from all kinds of backgrounds and just have a big party blink is popular because there just average guys that where called losers and freaks in high school and now are the best punk band aroundTAKE OFF YOUR PANTS AND JACKET!"
2,Not real punk rock.,"Come on people, Blink 182 is just a sad imitation of Sum 41. Everybody knows this. And Take off your Pants and Jack It is their worst album, much worse than Nothing Gold Can Stay, Lechuza and the Ever Passing Moment. Even though they are the originators of emocore, they've seemingly become worse than their imitators, and bands like American Hi-Fi have taken the title of ""punk rawk kings"" directly from under the heels of Mark, Tom, Travis and Show. My favorite song on here is ""(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction)"", even though it's a remake of the Britney Spears classic. But overall, Blink 182 needs to change their name to Blink 41 to give credit where credit is due. Canada forever!"
3,Good Try!,"Hey fellow blink (or ex) blink fans. I've been listening to blink ever since they had Scott (the old drummer...who kicked a$$.) No doubt in my mind that this c.d could not possibly be compared to ""cheshire cat"" - ""budda"" - and their best c.d ""dude ranch."" But I have to say that it is a little better than ""enema of the state."" I didn't buy ""TOYPAJ"" because basically their music is not as good as before, but i have heard a few songs that are pretty good on their new album...""the anthem song""-""online song""-and ""roller coaster."" All in all, good try by blink to be less pop and more punk...but i don't recommend it. peace, ""loserkid"""
5,Great!,"Thie CD is fabulous. I listened to it and it is as good if not better than Dude Ranch. It is more ""punky."" Much harder than previous albums. This albums seems to go more back to the roots of punk than previous Blink albums."
3,haha roots this....real punk that...STFU,"haha you bitter bastards. wtf is up with all this ""go back to your roots"" bs? f-that, if they want to write songs for 16 year olds, thats cool, they can relate to it. maybe you cant. maybe you shouldnt be listening to them. haha. buy music you can relate to / or at least you like. punk."
5,"A deeper, smarter and surprisingly matured Blink 182 Album","Matured? Yes I said matured, a word I thought I would never have to use in regards to Blink 182. Don't worry, the rock is the same, but the lyrics (with excetions of the songs about incest and feces, which are getting rarer and rarer latley) are more profound than most of the new music out there. I started listening to Blink 182 when I heard the song ""Damnit"" because I connected with it. ""Story of A Lonely Guy"" is my new true anthem. I cannot believe how real this stuff is. The punk is still there, and with better words to surround it I have to say it's a front runner for album of the year.SONGS YOU MUST LISTEN TO: 1) ANTHEM PART 2 5) STORY OF A LONLY GUY 6) ROCK STAR 7) STAY TOGETHER FOR THE KIDS--H MAN OUT"
1,Best band? Best album? Best jest.,"Lemme say just one thing before I start---""Dude, I'm punk."" I have more Hurley shirts than I can count, bleached blonde hair, a warm/fuzzy/social-loudmouth personality, and I own a copy of ""Take Off Your Pants and Jacket"". It's really ""dope"" and some good stuff. Dude, I play it when I skate. Anyway, my friend doesn't like this ""C-D"" b/c he says skater punk isn't real punk. He was at his house, listenimg to ""(GI)"", his favorite, on vinyl, and told me to show my love for Blink-182. So I did since I like this ""C-D"". How? I obeyed the command of the album title. Tom, Mark, and Travis would have been proud. Now that guy doesn't hang out with me anymore.........."
5,This is a great Blink 182 CD!!!!!!!!,"This CD is one of the best CD's ever!!!!!! I have two of their CD's, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket and Enema of the State. To me they are both equal in greatness!!! I can listen to this one without skipping through one Track!! The bonus track is hilarious!! If you get a CD it should be this one!! I love it and I can't stop listening to it!! If you are a Blink 182 fan this is a must buy!! The best songs in my opinion are First Date, Online Songs, Take Me Home, and Stay Together For The Kids!! They sound great!! The whole CD is full of great lyrics and music!! You have to get this CD!! If you like good music get it!! Blink 182 is a great band and this is a great CD!! So pick it up if you get the chance and enjoy it like I do!!!"
4,Fairly good,Yes the Blink cd is good!it is very! the only thing it lacks are new guitar cords! it almost has the same compared to enema. The only other thing about the cd i don't like is that Blink 182 released 3 different cds! you could tell what cd you have by wat sinple is on the actual cd! on each different cd you have 2 different hidden tracks.
4,Blink Hits The Spot,"Just 5 days ago, I went to a record store to pick up a new CD...I was faced with a decision: What CD should I purchase? However, I was able to narrow it down to 3 CDs: Staind-""Break The Cycle,"" Eve 6-""Horrorscope,"" and Blink-182-""Take Off Your Pants And Jacket."" I slowly came to a painful decision to leave the Eve 6 and Staind on the store shelf, and purchase the Blink CD. So 5 days later, I am positive it was a good move. I absolutely LOVE this CD! But I guess the CD is still new for me, and I really haven't played it enough yet to get sick of it...But still, I absolutely love it, and would recommend it to anyone who bought either one of the previous Blink CDs. This one is a keeper. Fav. Track : ""Online Songs"""
3,Stink 182 - The Estrogen Album,"Blink is/were a great band! Why because of the raw isolated emotions that are expressed in their music. Unfortunately this album is lacking that. I first caught blink at soma fest in 95' Cheshire Cat did not leave the car stereo from CA to CO, it was that good. When listening to this album I thought maybe the next song will be better. TOYPJ is a well produced, mass marketed to cutesie teen rebelers disappointment. The riffs are familiar, the songs about girls. I now believe getting laid too much has affected their raw talent, and is a bad thing. Would have been 2 stars but Anthem 2 is still worth a listen. Keep on the Scoot Quarterly interviews guys."
5,Great album,This is one of the best blink cd's. Almost as good as cheshire cat but not quite. It has funny songs and clever and catchy lyrics. The guitar riffs are awesome. Good old blink is back!
2,a step towards nothing,"i never thought blink would sellout but this cd puts it in writting. the only reason it gets 2 stars is because blink is still a great band but really needs to stop being something their not. they really need to stop appealing to 8th grade girls and start appealing to their punk audience, or whats left of it."
2,"Not impressed, not as advertised. Simple vehicle to do, and failed.","I paid a premium price for these floor mats, and I am not at all impressed.1. No hole for the factory anti-skid hook2. No ""spikes"" on the bottom to keep them in place3. Color is totally off4. fit is just barely close (ordered custom fit floor mats)I paid over $100 for these floor mats and expected much better. I am totally unimpressed by these extremely expensive floor mats. Take a look at the list above and you can see why. I really feel ripped off. My worn out mats stayed in place when you entered/exited the vehicle, even when you vacuumed. Not these, they don't even sit flat, let alone fit the floor pans.These are thick floor mats, they appear well made. That's it. Should you want to put them at your front door I'm sure you will get compliments. Not in my Eddie Bauer Explorer. Not even close. Live and learn."
4,Good introductions,"This book reads a lot like the '5 views on...' series, but is probably a bit more scholarly in tone. It's a great introduction for anyone starting out studying Evangelical Theology."
2,Paying for the Thomas name,"I purchased this item as a Halloween pail to hold his candy. It was way smaller than I thought it would be... of course I didn't check the measurments being that it was a last minute purchase. (My fault). It seems rather cheap and the Thomas screen print does as well. It served it's purpose and will work fine for my sons Easter basket this year. I feel this product was overpriced. I clearly paid for the Thomas name and logo, NOT a quality pail."
3,Coils/Springs Exposed Inside the Bag...Needs More Lining,Overall a cute trick or treat bag...nice and lightweight for a one time use...but I was a little surprised that there wasn't any lining on the inside of the bag. The coils/springs are exposed...so watch out little fingers!
1,My Experience,"For the first three months, I was extremely happy with my purchase. The quality of screen display was excellent. Unfortunately, after 3 months of use, the monitor started randomly turning off and on during use. This could happen anytime and continue up to eight times in a row. I sent the monitor for warranty repair and was told that the main board needs to be replaced with a turnaround time of one week. It has been over three weeks and now I am informed that Sony had sent the wrong parts and I will have to wait. It is very annoying to pay a Sony price premium and experience the problems that I have encountered. Sony has lost the trust and custom of my family. You may wish to read the feedback of R.V.Hatcher who has experienced similar Sony monitor quality and service problems. His feedback can be found under the reviews for Sony SDMHS75/B 17"" LCD Monitor (Black)."
2,"Was good, not great, until it quit working","This is a pretty good phone for the price. Works pretty well, although I found the buttons to be a bit quirky. For example, sometimes when I hit the Headset button to start a call, I get a dialtone, but none of the number buttons will work. If I end the call and go through the process again, it works fine. Kindof strange. I have noticed a few ""button glitches"" like this. But the worst problem I have experienced is after using the phone for about 6 months. The Line 2 button just quit working all together. It just will not allow me to select Line 2. Line 1 still works fine, so I am just using it as a 1-line phone now. Could just be I got a defective phone, but because it only lasted 6 months, and the buttons sometimes are quirky, I had to give it only 2 stars."
4,"good, not great","the 2 line phone system works good. I have seperate lines going into 1 phone.The speaker phone, not so great."
1,Stinks,"I never did like this phone much. I only bought it because it was cheap. Boy, was it cheap. Like R. Farish said, the second line has just stopped working altogether so it's useless as a 2-line phone."
3,Outgoing speakerphone quality a deal breaker,"Pros;1. Base has a large footprint (but not too big),2. Price,3. Two line,4. Large, bright display (but see below),5. Suited for customers paying for optional message service (but see below),6. Battery backup, but time still has to be reset.Cons;1. Outgoing Speakerphone audio is low (dealbreaker as I use the speakerphone all the time), but incoming is very good (go figure),2. Space provided to write speed dial names in is way too small. Also, paper strip is curved making it hard to duplicate. Some icons on display are way too small,3. Message indicator function takes over the base, if you don't for the feature (Why should you in the first place, answering machines are cheap), it's a waste of space and buttons,4. Button layout should be reorganized,5. Poorly and sparsely written manual, leaves to much to figure out yourself."
1,Not full duplex speaker phone for a business phone,"This phone is cheap and it shows. Purchased one and the speaker phone feature was horrible in a conference setting which is important. The hand set was inoperable, was defective and I returned it for a full refund. Don't waste your money or time with this product for a professional grade business phone. It is NOT a quality phone it is junk.For those who demand the very best as I do you get what you pay for. I took my refund and purchased a Polycom SSE-225 and am well pleased with this phone."
5,Great for the money,"This phone is loaded with features and works extremely well for the price. I use it in my home office and allows me to better handle calls, know when someone is on one of the lines, be able to see who is calling, switch easily between handset, speaker and headset (and I love the feature which allows using a headset -- very unusual for this type of phone). Definitely worth the price."
2,Monsters and Monster Dissapointment,"This is not the first time that a wonderful show has turned the corner and gone off the path. The last Doctor is hard to replace so I did not expect someone to try to be him. The new doctor is a good actor and appears to read the lines with some energy, but he just is not into the role. He has no expressions what so ever. Many of these episodes involve monsters and those are not very good. When there is mostly people involved the Dr. and the stories are at least pleasant. His new side kick is a twenty something who looks 17 and adds little to the show. Once River Song shows up there is relief from the slow moving slog through a season long storyline. In my opinion the last 4 episodes are pretty good. THe first 9 not so much. When paying $60 plus for a season of a show why do we have to be subject to advertising that is hard to get around? This season actually makes Torchwood seem like a better show."
1,Terrible sound,"I bought last weeks episode through Amazon and had no problem but I couldn't continue to watch this. The sound was terrible. Initially I tried just going back a few seconds every time that sound would start but after a couple of tries, it didn't work so I gave up. I'll try to watch it from some other source."
1,sound is Messed up and wont play when downloaded!,I dunno whats going on but I was looking forward to watching this and the sound is messed up if you play it online and if I download it it won't play it says unable to play!!!
1,British humor goes Dr. Who.,"Psychic pollen?! Pfffft!Not one of my faves. Though the idea certainly works. A warning for Amy -- he's much more than the clever, silly, mysterious traveler."
3,It's just not the same,"I'm afraid this new guy just isn't Dr. Who. A little too young. And the storyline was very predictable and a little tedious. Tardis looks good, Amy Pond isn't bad."
1,why is the video not available for rent or purchase?,What's the deal with amazon not having the episode available. I've been purchasing each episode from amazon but this is not acceptable. I should have stuck with itunes.
3,"Thank you, Amazon, for the option","Thank you, Amazon, for offering the Standard Definition version. HD makes no difference on my Mac's screen. And thank you for offering this season. Basic cable no longer included BBC America.I miss David. Matt's OK. I feel how it is aimed at a younger, hipper audience."
5,All I could ask for,"When I received my Blu-Ray copy of this season of Doctor Who, I couldn't wait to start watching this DVD. It was worth the wait. The HD quality even on my PS3 was fantastic. The only downside to these DVD is I know they will end..... and then I can start on Season 6!"
3,"Three Stars for content, two for performance.","I have encountered a problem with these Blu-rays, the extras and previews play great but the episodes skip and the audio cuts out frequently, but only on my Blu-ray player. On my husband's computer and my son's Playstation 3 they play flawlessly. I'm very disappointed and confused."
3,Good purchase,Bought this for a friend's xmas present and she was pretty ecstatic about it. DVD box was also pretty cool because it had a holographic cover
5,Getting good,"I'm not often touched by a funny Sci Fi, but this one gets to me sometimes. I think the acting is really good, the issues very current, and it's also exciting. The Daleks are my least favorite thing, I find them boring......but all the other things are fun. I LOVE all the Doctors and their sidekicks, and it's unbearably sad when they have to part.....it doesn't seem fair. Love the show, I can see why it's run so long. The first seasons are a bit ""cheesy"", but only a bit, and they get steadily better as they go. I'm hooked!"
5,The sweetest episode ever,"When you think of epic romance, think of this episode: redemption, encouragement, hope! Most of the other travels are fun - you know, ghosts, vampires, aliens....but this is so utterly sweet and meaningful --- it ties in most everything about the show: the brevity and sanctity of life, the Doctor's line about good and bad piles, great art, true beauty, really seeing things for how they are. So many layers of goodness wrapped in...definitely a must watch even if you're brand new to Dr. Who, but the background gives a richer tapestry worth savoring. Go, watch, right now!"
5,Love the new series!!!,This new series rocks! Just saw the season finale on tv...Matt Smith is awesome as the doctor. Can't wait to see what the next season of his run as the doctor holds in store for us who fans
3,One of the worst Doctor Who episodes I've ever seen.,"This episode had so much potential, but it just turned into a ridiculous mess.**SPOILER**Since when does a fish commit suicide by jumping into water?Hope Matt Smith gets better. He's not horrible so far, but he's just not selling the genius, experienced Time Lord role yet. I miss David Tennant!!!"
5,Problem fixed,"So after talking with Amazon about the static problem, I was given credit towards more video on demand, and the problem was fixed in less than 12 hours. This episode is the best one yet of the series, and I can't wait to watch it on my Television.Edit - I just want to point out that the version that I watched was the one that I downloaded, not the one that streams off the web. It looks like Amazon has taken the ability to stream the video offline for the moment. I will have to wait to watch it on the big screen."
3,Disappointed,"As others have said in their reviews, the 5th series never matched the brilliance of the previous 4 seasons... not in the acting nor in the writing. I was willing to give Smith lots of room to make the Doctor his own, (especially after the stellar work of Eccleston and Tennant), but he just is not convincing. He is far too immature to pull it off, as is Gillian. But the biggest let-down was the writing... almost nothing original, and nothing of any substance... as immature as the actors. The one exception was the Vincent van Gogh story, which I thought was well done and up to the standards of the previous seasons. Even the TARDIS is a let-down... looking like a cheap circus. Sigh... I tried to like it (since I'm a big fan), but I just couldn't. I really hope the next season is better, and maybe Smith will grow into the Doctor's shoes and find some of the Doctor's wisdom. My real rating is 2 1/2 stars, but I'll bump it to 3 because I liked the previous seasons so much."
4,Love something different than regular US tv shows,"As an American, I find it refreshing that the show is a little bit different spin on things than regular US tv shows. I like David Tenate a little better as the doctor, but several episodes of this season 5 have been fantastic. My gf Jill has even been able to get on board with the wild stores and imaginative enemies and plots.If you love scifi, watch a few episodes of this and you will be hooked."
2,Bad writing makes for weak season 5,"Season 5 starts off with a bang with the new doctor and the first episode is amazingly fun. Then the writing does a three sixty turn and goes downhill fast. There are a couple of well written episodes along the way, but nothing consistent."
2,Broken box,"This was to have arrived as a new product, but the cover box is broken and one of the plastic pieces holding a dvd is broken. This was purchased for my son who is a huge fan of Doctor Who, and he is pleased with the series, just not with the casing. He really should get it replaced with one that is not damaged."
3,Rating the season,"It took me a while to get into this season. The season started off a bit uneven, the new Doctor just seemed ANGRY(?). And the plot relied a little too much on Amy getting put in a perilous position and having to 'trust' the Doctor to get her out of it. But it was quirky and fun and the Doctor seemed to get over his crankiness by the end."
1,Very Disappointing,"The individual DVD holders in the box set came apart on first opening the package. The set of DVDs were in reverse order (the first episode DVD was last, the last was first). Two of the discs are unreadable by either my DVD player or my computer. The DVDs are seen as region-free by my computer software, which I find curious. Also, on disc 3, episode 5 is titled ""Flesh and Sone"" rather than the correct ""Flesh and Stone."" I put in an inquiry to the shipper (BBM) via Amazon's link and am awaiting a response."
1,Worst. Episode. Ever.,"I'm a big fan of Doctor Who, both new and old, and this is easily the stupidest and worst written episode I've seen. I serves no other purpose but to introduce the candy colored daleks to sell video games.Especially since the daleks don't appear again for the rest of this season, this supremely sappy episode can easily be skipped. Go straight to River Song and the weeping angels. You can thank me later."
1,Really Bad Version (and season) of Dr. Who,"These episodes don't compare well at all with the last series starring David Tennant.This Doctor has a TOTAL dependence on that darn sonic screwdriver...he would be toast without it and that's not cool! The stories are just plain bad and I have started going to my local library to check out older series versions, and watch them on Saturday night instead of this season. I think the Sontarans would wipe out this cast quick, HA!I really hope they change both the characters and writing soon."
4,Great,"This episode introduced us formally to Amy Pond. She's interesting, but so far a bit shallow, although I assume they will flesh her out more later on. The plot in this one was iffy, but said a lot about the Doctor's personality. Overall pretty damn good."
4,New Doctor,I am too used to the old doctor and it will take time for me to get used to Matt Smith. The overall story was good though.
4,More Serious and Recommendable,"Though I've only seen two of the last three episodes of this Fifth Series (the last episode 'disappeared' from my download queue before I could watch it), I was oddly pleased and impressed -- it was quite enjoyable, even more 'serious' somehow, tho' the new Doc appears goofier and the plots were goofy, as always. But somehow Matt Smith, who is a terrific actor, injected some gravitas into the Doctor, while looking and acting, well, pretty goofy. Hard to explain, but it seemed like there's a more serious person in charge, everyone is taking the wackiness more seriously, and there's a new, more grown-up feeling to the whole thing. Which is a good thing. I recommended to two friends that they take another try at the series, which they had previously rejected as too childish. There's a difference between enjoyable goofy and puerile, and this new series appears to fall on the right side of the line. Congrats to the new guys!"
2,"Great Show, Bad Blu Ray Product","The discs in this set will not play right on my Samsung 3D Blu Ray player. The sound cuts out constantly and you have to keep hitting pause then play to hear a few more seconds of audio before it happens again. I sent back the set and got a replacement, but the new ones did the same thing. I took my Blu Ray player back and got a different model, but the problem was even worse! I don't know if it's a problem where these won't play on just Samsung players, or if this is widespread, but I really wanted these to work. Instead I've had to send back the Blu Ray set and I guess I'll have to settle for DVDs of Season 5 instead."
2,Boring....,"I am dumbfounded at the number of people giving this incarnation of Dr Who good reviews. I've watched Dr. Who since I was a kid in the 70's. Most recently, I loved both Christopher and David as the Dr. (David Tennant is my fellow sci-fi friends and my favorite)This new Dr is so boring and bland I could barely stand to watch. Even the stories are dull and lack any real humor. We all tried to get into this new incarnation and none of my group can find something to like. I would say to anyone reading reviews before buying; Watch a few episodes first and decide for yourself. I guess it's all very subjective. But if you ask this Sci-fi fanatic, the newest Dr Who sucks and falls WAY flat of filling any of the previous Doctor's shoes."
2,Packaging Issues,"Let me start by saying that what I've seen of Matt Smith's tenure as the 11th Doctor is very promising so far. That's not what this review is aboutI was shocked, having purchased previous series of new Who as well as everything available at present of classic Who, to see how cheap and shoddy the packaging is the Series 5 releaseJust one piece of tape theoretically holding together all the trays the various DVDs are in. And numerous cracks in thoseBut the worst bit was being right in the middle of the two-parter The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone and, when I went to put in disc 3 to continue to story, having it not play. And then, turning the disc over, seeing a huge crack in itI'm not sure if something happened during shipping or what, but I'm quite disappointed and will be returning it. It's put a hamper on my enjoyment of Series 5. Maybe I should have gone to Best Buy to get it or some such...Doctor Who: The Complete Fifth Series"
4,Dr Who. Concept over details.,"Season five has been keeping in line well with the Who reboot except with a little more class. This episode is a prime example how the individual parts are a bit silly (old people shooting pollen) but the overall concept and message is very strong. I actually like this balance and wouldn't want them to ""fix"" the silly parts as thats what makes it Dr Who in my opinion. Goofily deadly serious."
4,A good first series for the new Doctor,"I came into Series 5 not sure what to expect. My favourite of Doctor of the new series was leaving, but so was my least favourite companion.Matt Smith starts off kind of shaky as a completely discombobulated Doctor, but he eventually settles into the role. Karen Gillan, on the other hand, is brilliant all the way through. She may actually top Freema Agyeman as my new favourite companion.This series is a little slim on extras. There are a couple ""Meanwhile in the TARDIS"" deleted scenes, 5 'In-Vision Commentaries', and Monster Files on the Daleks, Weeping Angels, Silurians, and The Alliance. Now, to be fair, I haven't gone all the way through Disc 6 yet, which is the Doctor Who Confidential episodes.Still, all in all, it's definitely worth picking up for any fan of the new series."
2,They were trying too hard,I am older and wiser than the child who could believe the truce will hold.Pity: a great cast and a great last scene between the Doctor and Elliot's Mother.
5,Give it a chance,"I really liked both the 9th and 10th Doctors, and really didn't think I was going to like the 11th Doctor- Matt Smith. But after a few episodes, I started to get his style. At least watch until ""Amy's Choice"" or ""Vincent and the Doctor"" before passing final judgment. Yes, there are a few sub-par episodes, but in my opinion there are some in each season. My only small complaint is that I really don't see that Rory has any purpose. Oh well, I thought that about Micky, and look what happened there."
2,Irritating reverberation spoiled the viewing experience,"We have been Dr. Who fans for many years. However, we got the DVD version of the fifth season and, at least on the disks we got, the sounds reverberated so badly in many scenes, especially inside closed spaces such as the Tardis, that we had to turn the sound off and read the subtitles instead. It is hard for us to believe that such an irritating sound recording could have been intentional."
3,I don't understand the pricing,"I don't understand why the DVDs for this season cost $60, while you can buy the whole season as digital downloads for $10 ($13 in HD). Why the complete disconnect in pricing?"
2,I was disappointed ...,"With Series Five, at least for our family, Saturday nights were set aside for watching Doctor Who. However, as the season progressed, we found ourselves actually forgetting to watch. The stories were just not intriguing enough to keep us interested.As for Matt Smith, I loved him. He is cute and reminiscent of Tom Baker enough to engender a love of him in the role. However, while Karen is a good actor, I did not care for her character at all and I especially hated her too short mini skirts.All in all, I think I will purchase a couple of the Tom Baker episodes rather than the Fith Series. Hopefully, the next season will be an improvement."
5,Sonic-Screw Everyone,"Like it, hate it, or I don't care, the Doctor will carry on. You will find the following information at the ""TV Shows On DVD"" web site. Doctor Who, series (or season)5, 13 shows on 6 luscious disks, BBC-TV & WHV (WB), with a release date of November 9th, 2010. When Amazon wants more of our hard earned cash perhaps we can place orders ??? Have Fun :)"
1,"Frame Rate is so bad, it's unwatchable.","The Frame Rate is just so bad, I can't even describe it, almost as if it's just a little too slow. I've probably waited too long to return them and I'm scared to purchase replacements - out of 3 blu-ray sets of Doctor Who I've purchased (Tennant Goodbye specials, season 5 & 6, all have this frame rate issue."
3,From Eccleston to Smith?,"This show started off super strong with Eccleston, and continued strong with Tennant. I don't know. Smith leaves me with a sweet taste. TOO sweet. I perfer a strong doctor, and Smith just came off too clownish, and silly. With the 6th season he gets a little stronger. My friend told me it wasn't Smith who's the problem, it was the writing, and it's true: the head writer has changed from Davies to Moffat. I'm really hoping he'll take the show out of the sand box. There's a lot of really profound themes in Dr Who, but more is spent on fairytale scenes meant for children 8-10 years old. What I can say? It could be ""so much better"". I hope it'll grow up soon."
3,Yet another show/movie ruined by blaring soundtrack,"The title of my review pretty much says it all. I could not hear what was being said much of the time due to the relentless, blaring background music. This is an ongoing problem in many movies today (although it is far more common in Hollywood than most things from the UK). I think the days when music was used to accent what is going on or provide dramatic cues is rapidly becoming a thing of the past.It's a shame, as I thought this latest Doctor Who incarnation was pretty good otherwise. However, the music pretty much took me right out of the whole thing."
4,The Legend Continues,"Like may others, I was a bit skeptical when it was announced that Matt Smith would be taking over for the brilliant Mr. Tennant. However, I was (and forgive me, fellow Who fans, for saying this) also skeptical when I heard about Tennant taking over for Christopher Eccleston. I decided to give both men the benefit of the doubt and I was glad I did. I was pleasantly surprised at Smith and the way he instantly took charge of the role and made it his own. From his first craving for apples to his repeated assertion that bow ties are cool to saving the universe with Amy, Rory and River, Matt Smith has firmly cemented himself as the Doctor and I can't wait to get this box set and relive every pulse-pounding, jaw dropping, bow tie clad moment."
4,DISCS WONT PLAY...ROUND TWO!,"My mother and I are major whovians. LOVE the show! Love Eccelson, Tennant and Smith equally but for different reasons. IT IS MAGIC!! So when I ordered the sixth series for my mom on Bluray, she loved it so much I also ordered the fifth series for her...But the discs don't play! She has all of the newest updates and firmware, and a very nice player (samsung model bd6500). We returned the set, and had to buy a new one (this time order fullfilled by amazon). One week later, same problem! The discs are supposed to play in the USA right?? It says region 1, her player doesn't seem to be the issue because the sixth series plays PERFECTLY! Anyone else have this problem? I guess we're returning it again, much to our dismay..."
1,Worst series since the 80s,Matt's okay but everything else really faltered this season. Moffatt is the worst showrunner since JNT. Even my eight year old said the show is no good anymore.
1,This just isn't any good,"I'm living in the Netherlands and have waited for the online version of Doctor who season 5 to be available since the release of the Christmas special. I Loved all the Mofatt eps in Davies era, so I was looking forward to the new series. I'm sorry but it's a total disappointment. I watched ep 1 online and thought that I had accidentally downloaded some cheap Scifi show from the states. The story line was unappealing for adults older than 8, the new Doctor is emotionless and cold, and Amy is as charming as a pouting goldfish. Why did they do such a horrible job at casting? I kept watching, hoping that it would eventually get better, but even the ep with the weeping angels was an utter disappointment, by the time I got to the Vampire ep, I just stopped watching. I think I just keep my old DVDs of Ten/Davies era and forget about this new ""kiddie"" Doctor who. I'm way too old to believe in an wandering stick insect who saves planets trailing a blowlipped kipper.Cheers"
1,Lame. . .,"OK, sure, it's the new Doctor Who, but. . .they should have just retired it when David Tennant left. BORING. What happened??? I've TRIED to like it, but he's just too lame, too pale, overly animated, and the music is usually too loud to understand the dialogue! No, I won't be buying this series. I'm sure Matt Smith is a nice kid, but he's too young, too stiff, and just not experienced enough to do The Doctor.I'm sorry, kid, but. . .go back to university or something, OK?"
3,Wrong screen type,I am a Dr addict! In the last 3 months I have ordered and watched Series 1 to 4 and 6 plus the matching specials. All came in full screen format. So far I can only find wide screen for the fifth season on Amazon. I hate the wide screen format and will not buy it at any time.Why is the fifth season not out in normal TV full screen? I will order it ASAP when that is available.Otherwise I have loved the quality of all my previously purchased Dr Who's from Amazon.
3,Matt McCoy is fine but....,"The writing is very uneven for this 5th series. Gone are everything familiar about the show in the past except the Tardis. Matt Smith is good as the Doctor. His portrayal offers a more quirky Doctor and Karen Gillian is fun too, I just think Moffat, whom I had a lot of faith in, hasn't quite gotten in the groove yet. Time to bring back some of the writers from the previous series and get it back on track. The season ender is a step in the right direction. The Lodger is step in the wrong."
2,Dr. Who Fifth Series,"I recieved this item with good packaging and in great time but when I opened the product the actual case the movies are in was broken. The disks were still fine but the plastic part that held the discs had disconnected from the movie case itself. Wish it would not have been broken, especially after paying over $50 on the item. It said it was new, I was hoping for perfect condition."
5,Very Cute Episode,"The Tardis lands on present day Earth and the Doctor is thrown outside the Tardis leaving him stranded on Earth and Amy still inside. He tries to figure out what happend and he finds his answer in a small house occupied by a single man named Craig. The Doctor roomates with him and befriends Craig so he can save Amy and the world.This is the cutest episode for this season. There were many funny moments watching the Doctor befriending Craig. The funniest is when he headbutts Craig twice so he can learn and understand everything about the Doctor in a few seconds. Matt Smith is at his funniest in this episode, his acting is great! I was laughing."
4,Interesting Story,"The Doctor takes Amy and Rory to England in 2015. They land in a small mining village where a large drill is setting a record. It drills deep into the earth and it caused an unusual event. The ground fights back. It shallows a man along with Amy. Rory and the Doctor try to find them and they discover that beneath the earth is a race of lizard people. The lizard people took the drilling as a threat so they attack the Doctor and his gang. The Doctor thought they were aliens but he soon finds out they they are not aliens but from Earth.This is an OK episode. I was under suspense and a little scared when I didn't know what these lizard people were but once I understood that they're from Earth, I was disapointed. I expected the plot of the story a little more suspenseful. This is part one of a two part episode."
3,hard time connecting with the new Doctor,"I really enjoyed the first four seasons having watched them all over the last month. But I must say that I am having a hard time connecting with the latest Dr. Who and his companion Amy. I know this is all personal preferences. I'm sure others love both of them. I should've never looked ahead to see if there was going to be a season 7 and who would be The Doctor because unfortunately for me, it is still Matt Smith. I'm up to episode 10 of season 5. Hopefully by the time I get to streaming season 6, I'll have been won over."
4,Not as good as Tennant,"Matt Smith is a strange guy, which I think may be a prerequisite for playing the Doctor. I've really enjoyed Season 5 and the Christmas episode but so far he isn't half the Doctor that David Tennant was. Now, with that being said, this season is my second favorite season of Doctor Who, right after series 2 and I have a feeling that series 6 will blow it out of the water. Steven Moffat has shown that he is a tremendously talented writer and has done a really great job with long plot threads and keeping things together. The twist to the episodes with the Weeping Angels (revealed many episodes later) was great to see, and I have been happy to see more of River Song. All in all it is a fantastic season."
5,New Doctor grows on you,"I started out very skepticle of Matt Smith and his portrayal of The Doctor. But by the end of the season I was sold! I think for those of us Tennant fans, it may take a while to accept Smith's Doctor. He's quite different. But I think just as brilliant in his own way. The stories of this season are just as good as the previous seasons. Give it a chance!"
3,I REALLY wanted to like this...,"...but I just couldn't. The beginning of the series left much to be desired. I wasn't drawn in to it like I was with Eccleston and Tennant. There was nothing in the beginning that left me saying ""Now THAT'S my doctor!"" Absolutely nothing.I tried very hard to enjoy the series. 'The Vampires of Venice' was overkill--why must every show have vampires?--and 'The Time of Angels' left me completely bored with the idea of the weeping angels. Even the series finale left me wanting more.I'll admit, Matt Smith and Karen Gillian are great actors, but the writing made them worse than they could've been.I might consider buying this set, but not at this price. Maybe I could manage to part with twenty dollars for it, but no more than that. This is not the Doctor Who that I fell in love with.But yes, I will continue watching. I still have hope that the writing could get better and the Doctor could seem less... well, mad... before the end of the next series. We'll see."
1,Not Good Quality,The dvds skip and stall all the time! I bought this as a gift for my husband and he is so disappointed in the quality.
4,He's a madman with a box and obsessed with Amy's crack...,"A wonderful start to another Doctor.Could have been better, but it was excellent acting and fun situations. Writing started of very well and slid backwards toward the end (aside from the awful Dalek Story) when the show became more like the past few series. Steven Moffatt's abilities were stuck more on strong situations and a little less on logic of the stories. The acting and characters were warm and welcoming. Smith's Doctor was an old man in a younger body and came off as someone that is more like Doctors prior to 1980.If this is a progressive step, the next years could be the best since Tom baker left the series. Let's hope so."
2,Used to be good but...,"Dr Who used to be good and I greatly enjoyed it but it has begun to be nothing but a platform for pushing ""alternative lifestyles."" Do not misunderstand me. I do NOT have ""something agianst gays."" I am just not gay and I get rather tired of a show which, more and more seems to be nothing but an, ""in your face"" advertisement for ""gay is ok.""It is supposedd to be entertainment, not propoganda."
2,Much worse than the previous 4 seasons,"Why do so many people seem to call this the ""best DW season yet""? Compared to the previous 4 series, this one is very, very poor. The scripts are boring and childish; Gillan and Smith make a very poor team - they mumble and have very intolerable accents in addition to displaying very limited and amateurish acting skills; the sound, video, and special effects are dull and repetitive; and the overall seasonal plotline lacks any coherence or follow-through.I give this season 2 stars, only for making a feeble effort to keep the series alive. Hopefully, things will get better or die gracefully."
5,A different but Great Doctor,"I was a big fan of David Tennant so was a little unsure of Matt Smith as the Doctor but after watching this series, I'm totally on board with him! He's different, but in a good way! Being able to watch this On Demand is awesome too. The whole series is awesome, every episode. Some are better than others but that's the way it always is!"
4,"This is when I finally, fully accepted Eleven","OK, you're surrounded by dangerous enemies. You're put in charge of a band of well-armed strangers. You're not sure you can trust the lady who led you here. And your ship is running out of power.Then Amy gets her strange eye infection. What a weekend holiday for the Doctor! The Doctor finally shows us his strong, determined, clever ""hero"" persona.Like many older fans, I did not like the coda. Stephen, we get it: he's handsome, he has some intriguing friends, AND the fastest, hippest mode of transportation around. Amy doesn't know that this boyish-faced, athletic, ""mad man with a box"" was a grandfather. Nor that his mores prohibit intimate relationships with humans.Pity. One suspects that this one would be loyal."
3,Well Packaged......Ruined Disks,I was excited to be able to watch the first episode of the 5th series. Until it hit an extremely low point. In the middle of the show the picture started to look like it was digitally scratched. As I put in a new disc it happened to the other disc as well. It so far has happened on 3 DVD's and I feel sad about it. I don't think I could return and receive a new one for the inconvenience but I will make do with what I have. I appreciate the time put into sending me this amazing show.
4,The best quality DVDs so far.,I have ordered from other venders and have had to return DVDs because of their quality. Not true with this place. It was in perfect condition and came quickly. Thanks for the great experience!
4,Getting better,"I didn't like Smith much, but he's starting the get the hang out it. I love the Weeping Angels. This episode wasn't near as good as Blink, but still great."
5,"New Doctor, same old excitement","After his powerful Regeneration following the events of ""The End of Time"" everybody's favorite Time Lord finds himself in the year 1996. While the TARDIS (recently damaged from the Regeneration energy) repairs itself The Doctor meets a young girl named Amelia Pond who has a crack in her wall that scares her. The Doctor discovers that the crack is not only in the wall but in time and on the other side is a prison that is missing a Prisoner, Prisoner Zero. Before the Doctor can help though the Tardis sends out a warning that the engines are overheating and the Doctor jumps in before it vanishes. Twelve year later The Doctor returns and meets the now grown up Amy. After the defeat prisoner zero the pair set off on a journey across time and space. They save the last starwhale, meet vampires in venice, stop a war between humanity and the Silurians and fight Daleks during the London Blitz."
3,Doctor Who Series Five Blu Ray,"I love this version of Doctor and I love the content in here, but the only setback I had with this release were the lack of teaser previews, WHICH WERE RIGHTFULLY CORRECTED in the Series 6 box set, for the shows. All of the Who series replicated the episodic nature of the show and it's thrill and fun. This unfortunately was not. Instead of the traditional NEXT TIME... I got a generic large Doctor Who logo coming at the screen. It wouldn't be that bad if I would receive, at least, the full musical score like the original episodes had in the closing credits. Disappointed as I was the shows are still cool. I've checked an episode on Netflix, to see if this format was done like my Blu Ray and surprisingly IT'S NOT! Scratching my head confused to what version of the discs I have because it's different with minor nitpicks. If it had what I wanted I would have gladly rate it all stars across but without the things I wanted I have to give it 3 out of 5."
3,ok but not great,"This season is ok but not great. Matt Smith is ok but nothing speacial. I do like his Lighthearted approch to the role of the Doctor, but he shows none of the vulnerability,sadness or lonileness of the last of the Time Lords. Amy is ok but she treats Rory badly ,this is man who waited 2000 years watching over her. I do like the interaction between the Doctor and Rory, their is friendship, respect, and fear by Rory of the Doctor "" how he makes his companions react to danger to impress the Doctor"". I think the writing is not as good as it was with Doctor # 10, the whole ideal of a crack in time was silly and did not make a whole lot of sense. Most of the episodes in this season won't werth watching except for episodes 1,4,5,12,13. I do love River Song, the interaction btween her and the Doctor is great,the flirting,banter, and suspensions of the Doctor about who and what River is to him is wonderfull."
1,Deceptive title.,"I purchased this title to have access to the audio portion. The price for the KJV is a great price given the fact it is both English and Spanish, however the main reason I made the purchase was for the audio part. The link to the free audio turned out to be computer read audio. If I had known this, I would not have bought the kindle book. If you want audio bibringeding by a person, don't spend your money on this one."
3,as for the free audiobook link,I was disappointed to find that the audio link can not be accessed from the kindle. I like that this KJV has both English and Spanish but again I did not like that you can't link to the audio from the Kindle.
1,the worst,"I did not receive the book in my kindle, I have not been able to listen to it. I paid for something and didnt get it!!! VERY DISSATISFIED!!!"
2,Upset about the audio link,"It is not clear from the description that the audio link is not accessible from the kindle. I downloaded this for my parents, who already had a free bible on their kindle, but paid for this one so that they could listen to it as well and that is not going to be able to happen. Don't download this paid version unless you want to listen to it from your computer."
3,S'ok,"It's pretty good. Comparable to other silicone base stuffs. Lid does leak. I store mine sitting upright, so no probs. Buy it and try it. It's not like you'll regret it."
2,Straight Men can do better then this,"It has extremely greasy feel to it and it is way too slippery.Not that much pleasant experience.Feel like diesel and even light washing with soap isn`t good enough, to get rid of it.Most women don`t like it .Stick with water based especially if your women is self conscious .Best Yet is ""Baby Lotion"" and you`ll not be disappointed."
2,terrible dispenser,"It works. It's okay. I will probably buy a different silicone lube next time (pjur), if only for the bottle. I think it's a little thinner and not quite as nice as the other brand of silicone I've used, but honestly just opening this badly designed bottle is a buzzkill and I haven't closely compared the contents of the bottle.This 8.9oz bottle is awkward and messy to use. The stuff dribbles out, inevitably smearing the bottle, and it's difficult to control the amount. Oops, too little. Oops, too much. Messy and bleh. Once that hassle is over, it works fine."
5,I didnt realize how big it was!,I ordered this because I knew that it was waterproof so it would be usable in the shower and stuff but I didn't realize how big it really was. Its huge! I've gotten bottles of water that were smaller. But the upside to that is that it will last forever
5,fiance refuses to do it without it.,"This stuff is so good,last super long and is smooth has never been sticky at all. I would highly recommended for first timers and experienced couples basically everyone."
4,"Good product, poor bottle design","The lube is excellent, and you only need a couple drops of it. However, as soon as you tip the bottle, it starts dripping. And any pressure makes the bottle squirt out. I will not buy this again, next try will be the pump."
5,Wow! Huge Bottle,"I wasn't expecting a BIG bottle of this lube. This will last for a good while. I really enjoy the slippery feeling of this product.Some people think that it is too thin but that is the point. Who wants to feel thick globs of lube? I would much rather feel my partner's skin. You can use this product for almost all of your lubrication needs. 5 minute quickie? Sure...but it is going to linger much longer then that. ;-) An Hour of fun? You BET!!! After an hour you might want to reapply. Also I don't think this lube, by itself, is good for anal sex. It does much better as a blend in that situation. My sweetie LOVES this lubrication when I use my hand on him. He says it gives a good sensuous gliding feeling with every stroke."
4,It's awsome,"I really like this product because it is not sticky like other products. Also, it is so smooth and silky. Love it. Never go wrong with this one."
4,Super Slick ;),"My wife and I have been using this product for a few years and it is super slippery and peforms great. I'm not sure what Amazon's policies are on explicitness so I will try to be discrete while still getting the point across here. I would not recommend this for ""alternate entry"" because it is so hard to wash off. She doesn't like it in her at all. We only use it now for her great hand skills ;) That way it is ""on"" us and not ""in"" us. We use the other Wet products for other activities (both the Wet regular and Wet light)."
5,Mr. Gill Strikes Again,"This was my second selection in the long list of Mr. Gill's books. I started with his next to last book and now know some things about his characters that I would not have found out going in the opposite direction. But even with that said, I find myself entranced by the characterizations in these two books. I have become quite comfortable with the repeating case of characters and I enjoy my time with them. The murder being handled sometimes seems secondary to other issues in their lives. While I did have some trouble keeping the three potentially villainous women in this novel clear in my mind, it was nevertheless a fun read. I have always avoided the reading of Joyce's Ullyses, but Gill makes an excellent case for my reconsideration of that decision. He also brings me back, clearly and strongly, to all my memories of my one trip to Dublin and certainly encourages me to return. All in all this is a fine story, well-researched and with characters well worth remembering."
4,A Literary Treat,"THE DEATH OF A JOYCE SCHOLAR by Bartholomew GillBloomsday, Dublin, Ireland, June 16 - The traditional reenactment of the Dublin day as described by James Joyce in ULYSSES finds one of the participating scholars murdered, with similarities to that fictional account. Who would want Kevin Coyle dead and why? Chief Superintendent of the Murder Squad of the Irish Police (Garda Siochana) in Dublin, Peter McGarr and his squad will have to find out.It seems just about everyone connected with the case has motive and opportunity and McGarr and his people have to ferret out the truth. Gill leads us through many a twist and turn and side trip until the reveal at the very end. I never could figure out ""who dunnit"" and that kept me reading.I'm landing in Dublin on June 16 this year and am looking forward to the experience in a different way now that I have read this book. What a great opportunity for me! And what a great opportunity for you to travel with me as you read this book."
4,"Kinch, the knife-blade","I liked the book, as a dilettante Joyce scholar myself. I also liked the atmosphere of Dublin on the brink of changing from the destitute town of the Sixties to the capital of the only European tiger. But I was perplexed by the reference to Kinch (the nickname of Kevin Coyle and of Stephen Dedalus) as meaning a noose, when Bock Mulligan himself clarifies its meaning: Kinch, the knife-blade (Ulysses, ch. 1)"
3,Alright,"Its alright, could have done without the cgi knife stab at the beginning. I cant stand a horror flick with cgi. Its alright in any other type. The story is ok, but thats about it."
5,Lil Wayne 500 Degreez,"Lil Wayne's 500 Degreez is a 5 star classic. Lil Wayne proved that he is truly the only Hot Boy that mattered. Sure , Turk will be missed-but Lil Wayne more than makes up for the loss of anyone. Mannie Fresh and Jazze Pha's beats have never sounded better, and there is a nice mix of guest appearances on this album as well. Stand out tracks are ""Look at Me"", ""Way of Life"", and the title track where Wayne rips a beat originally on Juvenile's 400 Degreez. After Hood Rich has been a huge success and now this album, Cash Money is definitely running things in 2002. Buy this album."
4,pretty good,"This is the 3rd lp from (D)wayne Carterit is good, the song with petey pablo is very good.IF YOU WANT TO HEAR MORE FROM LIL WHEEZY CHECK OUTTHE BLOCK IS HOT LP (1999)."
3,Hot but not Hot Enough,"Somebody misread da temperature. This was by no means hotter than 400 degreez, PERIOD. Juvy brought his own style to da table wit some of Fresh's hardest beats. Wayne stole somebody style(Yall remember when he did'nt sound like this) and rapped on da most commercial Fresh beats to date. The Carter should have been 500 Degreez or better yet 350. YEAHHHHHHH"
5,Gangsta,"Some don't like weezy's style, but i think this cd is hard. my favorite song on here is ""go hard"". i think he's the best part of cash money, to bad b.gizzle still isn't around to do songs with him."
1,Nothing Special...,"I'll be honest...I never liked the single ""Way Of Life"" that Lil' Wayne released. I bought the album, being a fan of 400 Degreez, hoping that Wayne had something more to offer. Besides some tracks like ""Look At Me"" and ""500 Degreez"", I was not impressed. Lil' Wayne's strange voice and ""keyboard beats"" did not keep me captivated. I found myself skipping many tracks. I still pop it in for an occasional blast of some of the better songs (there are 21 and only 3 or 4 are worth listening to). If you're a hardcore Lil' Wayne fan who's grown accustomed to his sound, this is the album for you. For others, keep your distance."
3,Boo!More like 300 Degreez!,"This cd isn't that bad but its not 500 degreez. There are like 4 or 5 good songs on there and the rest are OKAY. But some of the songs on there I THINK are HORRIBLE. I thought it was better than Lights Out but Tha Block is Hot was much better. If lil'wayne and the big tymers are the only ones that left than Cash money is done with. I don't care what people say Juvenile was cash money and once he leaves cash money is over. So if you want a good lil wayne album get Tha block is hot. But if you want the best record put out by cash money than get 400 degreez by Juvenile. Also Chopper city in the ghetto is good too, better than that 500 degreez nonsence."
5,500 Degreez,This Is a very good album and I recommend it to all peeps who like Cash Money . Some of my Favourites are :Way of life (Good)Where You At (GOOD)Gangsta Sh!#Go HardFu** You (GOOD)Young'n BluesBeleive ThatGet That Dough
2,u a cold rapper,u a hater. u know and so does cmr know that juvi and bg was the real hot boys. that 5 oo junk is the worst album cmr has made u need to fine a new style or just quit and for cash money when yall lost the duo yall lost everything
5,500 degreez let it burn,"this cd right here, is by far the greatest cd I ever listened to. all I got to say is keep bringin dat fire CMR."
4,CASH $ ON TOP!,"THIS ALBUM IS LIL WAYNE'S BEST ALBUM.THERE WASN'T A SONG THAT I SKIPED OVER.THE BEATS HIS FLOW IS ALL TIGHT.I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD BE AS GOOD STATING THAT THE ALBUM IS CALLED 500 DEGREEZ,BUT I WAS AMAZED AT HOW GOOD THIS ALBUM IS.IF YOUR A FAN OF CASH MONEY,OR BOUNCE MUSIC PICK UP THIS ALBUM.YOU WON'T BE DISAPOINTED."
5,Bangin album,"Lil Wayne's 500 Degreez is awesome. Stand out tracks include Way of Life, Gangstas and Pimps, Gangsta S***, Where You At, and Youngin Blues. Buy this album--you will not be disappointed."
4,It's on fiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiirrrrrrrrrrrrrrrre!,"I haven't finished listening to the album yet. I have listened to the first 16 tracks and I can still say that the album is worth it. There is noooooooooooooooooooooooo way that this album is as hot as 400 degreez though. .... It is definitely worth buying. My favorite joint so far is ""Lovely"". The production, on ""Lovely"", kind of reminds me of the Clipse's ""Grindin'"". Therefore this album is definitely something to listen to to hype you up before going to the club."
2,100 Degreez,"With the departure of its other star artists, like Juvenile, the Cash Money clique is hanging its hat on Big Tymers and Lil Wayne. Too bad for them. If ""500 Degreez"" is any indication of the future, Cash Money better plan for some dark days ahead. Lil Wayne's latest CD is pure recycled garbage with brash and boastful lyrics from a would be superstar who is ready to wear the mantle, but who isn't yet capable of delivering the lyrics he believes he's capable of. In short, the spirit is willing, but the mouth just can't deliver the goods. Manny Fresh gives Wayne the beats to work with--not Manny's best, but good. However, you can't enjoy the beats for the below-average raps. Sorry Wayne, you're not hotter than Juvy. Better luck on your next CD which I'm sure you'll title, ""The W Code""."
5,WHAT THE HELL,"ALright alright. Some people like to think they are INTELLIGENT so they don't listen to rap. That's fine, listen to classical by all means. But i would just like to note that for one, the person who wrote the above review wrote it with many spelling mistakes and grammatical errors and apparently they are intelligent? ok....Anyway, this CD is not 'wack' something that only very 'lame' people would say it's actually extremely entertaining AND the lyrics are very solid throughout. Those of you who only listen to the beats without paying any real heed to the lyrical 'flow' will not be disappointed but will not receive their money's worth from the CD. Pretty Damn Hot."
5,Janet Brace - Special Delivery CD,"I am seeing a woman whos mother was Janets first cousin and she grew up knowing her as a young child. Janet moved to Florida in later years and then ended up in Costa Rica later in life, ultimately returning to Florida to live with her daughter before she passed away. The mastering on the CD was well done and it is an enjoyable listening experience after listening to the old vinyl LP from the 50's. Recommended buy if you can find one."
3,OK At Best,I bought this clamp to complement the Kreg set I bought. It's made in China so I think it's half junk. It doesn't have a smooth action and the clamp pads are not like the small clamp that comes with the Kreg set. It has only one large pad not two. From what I've seen at the local hardware stores... you could buy a similar Irwin clamp and epoxy some pads to the existing ones. Of course you could be like me and buy this one but now you are informed.
4,an excellent introduction for the student,"This volume is an excellent addition to the Pediatric Habilitation series. It is just the right size and level of complexity for medical students and pediatric housestaff on a one month rotation or elective in Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, and is brief enough to be useful to the medical practitioner as a quick review of the basic principles of development. The present text is an excellent summary of the basic principles needed to avoid the more common errors in managing developmental problems. It fills an urgent need for a concise overview and is highly recommended as an introductory text for students at all levels."
4,Excellent overview,"This is an excellent addition to the Pediatric Habilitation series. It is just the right size and level of complexity for medical students and pediatric housestaff on a one month rotation or elective in Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, and it is brief enough to be useful to the medical practitioner as a quick review of the basic principles of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics. The present textbook fills an urgent need for such a concise overview of an enlarging and important piece of pediatric medicine. It is highly recommended as the introductory text for students at all levels."
5,Everything Drawing Book,I like this book so much I bought it 2xs without knowing it. Very good illustrations & directions. I guess i would buy it again..oops I did lol..very imformative and very helpful.
4,Finally,"This CD has a lot of differences from other Psychopathic CDs. Not in a bad way but just a little different. For example, the remix of Joke Ya Mind has strings in it. There is some crazy depth to this flavor and I am glad it finally came out. Of course everything that psychopathic puts out is the Nuke and I have never been unhappy with what they put out. I am like a[n addict] for their stuff."
3,boobies!,"Jumpsteady is an alright rapper, but when you drop a cd thats been anticipated for more than a decade, you make it more than an EP stupid ass!"
3,A little tight,My husband liked the shirt but said it was a little tight and the collar is high so it keeps rubbing his neck. He probably won't wear it often.
5,Good Cotton shirt,It seems good for playing any sport or going to the Gym. But according to a recent test it can also be use for vegetating on the sofa watching movies on the weekends ñ_ñ
4,Great character study,"I love Edna Ferber's work because she offers such a detailed look at her characters, and also succeeds in capturing a moment in time, place and history. The ending took quite a leap, for me, but overall I loved the book. Enjoy."
4,"Super photo quality printer, scanner, fax and copier","We've had our HP 2410 for 3 years now, haven't ever had trouble with it and would buy another one, most likely it's predecessor... This printer prints really nice photos, one of the hinge points of our selection. The only thing I'm critical of is the fax, one must scan each page in until all the pages are in memory before the fax can be sent. If for some reason it keeps redialing or a print task interrupts the fax operation, you must re-scan all the pages again to attempt sending the fax, a big deal if your faxing several pages. I would prefer the automatic feed from behind-style fax, but overall I'm happy with this printer and it's functioning."
5,Nice book for people who love the great outdoors,"The author of this book portrayed the Canadian environment as if one was really there. I actually felt cold in the ice and snow, and felt happy with the characters, as well as experienced their heartships with them.The main character, Jean Paul, is a great role model for young men who begin their own journeys and personal struggles in entering adulthood. I think a lot of young people can truly relate to the characters.I highly recommend any young person to read this book - esp. if they love the outdoors."
2,Loss of momentum,"I loved the central concept of this book that the ""Spirit Lights"" spoke to the those who would only listen. Although the characters were interesting, I found the second half of the book lost impetus and the ""Spirit Light"" concept was never fully developed."
1,Bad Design,"The top lip of this sink is a catch all for dirt and grime and seems like an endless chore to keep it clean. Take my advice and choose something easier to clean, something without the type of lip that this sink has."
2,"A good cast, so what went wrong?","I remember first seeing this movie on USA Network when I was really young. I feel the same way today as I did back then, why was this movie only average despite a good cast? First, we have Hsu Feng, a kung fu fighting femme fatale. Next, there's Carter Wong, who's film credits are too numerous to list. Finally, there's the awesome Chang Yi (just check him out in ""Shaolin Invincible Sticks"", ""Eagle's Claw"" & especially in Samo Hung's ""The Victim"".) Except for the rousing opening & the fairly exciting end fight, the middle is absolutely boring. I don't know if anybody else noticed this, but almost all the fights in the middle took place in the dark. This is a lame tactic usually used because 1) the DP was incompetent, 2) the film's budget wouldn't allow for more lights or 3) to cover up an actor's lack of martial skill. A so-so film recommended only to Carter Wong and/or Chang Yi completists only. Hey, they can't all be as awesome as the Venoms, right?"
2,Good Cast Again Misused,"The Grandmaster of the WuTang trains a gifted student,but finds him turning towards the dark side of Kung Fu.Awaiting his inevitable return to destroy Shaolin,the abbott trains new disciples to prepare for the merciless onslaught. Good plot,GreatActors, Boring movie."
2,Mtstihojagacunuferenesty,"I don't know what mystagogue means, but it must not mean good. I actually thought that this movie was one of carter wong's better performances, acting wise not fighting. But the kungfu in this movie is literally all crap. I was entertained for about 5 min. total in this movie."
3,medical,"worked some what, but not 100% gonedoesn't take much too shampooswo overall not badf for the pricethanks"
2,A mixed bag...,"As opposed to what is claimed by the previous reviewer, this record is a compilation of various songs ranging (I am assuming) from the 50's through the 90's. Like many other ""value"" recordings, the sound quality is acceptable in some spots and totally unacceptable in others. For instance, this record opens with a sort of a 90s smooth-jazz version of ""The Thrill is Gone,"" which, as opposed again to the previous reviewer's comments, is not an alternate version, but sounds like some type of bootlegged recording from a soundcheck. None of the performances, however, are dated in the liner notes and the packaging in general is pretty cheap.There are plenty of other great BB records one can get instead of this. I get the feeling that BB likely isn't enjoying any of the royalties from this stinker anyway."
4,Good Early Album that Displays BB's Jazz and Blues Abilities,"This is a good album for BB fans. If you are not a big fan than you should look into other, more known recordings, but if you are interested in hearing his other music then the album is very good. It has a different version of the popular ""The Thrill is Gone"" that is pretty neat and also the price is right!"
1,Quorum Silver,"I received this item and was disappointed big time. It has very little scent, and part of the cologne content was missing. It was not filled up to the top. It made me feel cheated. This company has had this same type of complaint leveled against it before. I can see why now. Don't buy unless you want to waste your money. Tuccni isn't a good company."
5,other reviewer doesnt get the joke and is an idiot,"this is apost modern joke and RIFF on conspiracies, drugs, politics, cults, and the underground presented as by jumping from the consciousness of one character to another. the other reviewer obviously was looking for some rightist, anti freemason, militia type, study on the anti-christian, international communist, new world order nonsense & should stick to watching Jack Van Impe and reading either Dan Rown or the Left Behind series..."
1,Terrible Kindle Formatting,"Even if it's currently 99 cents, it's formatted so terribly that it's worthless. This may be a good book, but Kindle owners will never know as it's unreadable."
5,Excelent for my child,"This Cd is Quite good. I've heard of this girls from Argentina that had been playing in new York & I bought the CD. It's real fun, my child seem to be very pleased with all the songs. Your kids will be dancing for sure with this girls."
1,You are a fool if you buy it,"Don't even think of it, when there's so much music in this world which is pleasant to hear. This will make you deaf. I didn't buy it, it was a present from a person which I love but obviously hasn't got much music sense. I don't wanna be selfish, but I do know about music, I'm a music student, and I wish to be a singer. But this is not even music. The lyrics are stupid and the voices of these half-people (because they really are beasts) are scaring.Caution: If you listen to this, you will inmediately go to hospital. Believe me, the one who buys this hasn't got music sense."
3,Educational and Interesting,"This book provides simple explanations on the original and significance of Christian symbols. Within these pages are various symbols, some which few Christians remember, that reveal how Christians honor their faith and the Messiah who established it. The one thing that would have made this book better is if the author had provided photographs from cathedrals, cemeteries, etc. where these symbols originated. Apart from this, the book is still interesting and educational."
4,Interesting Reading,I bought this to use as reference in my doctoral dissertation on icons and idols. I did quote and source this book but would have liked to see more in-depth information.
4,need to eat,"I notice , a lot of these products are not reviewed , and we are so happy to find them at a reasonable price. We had this for breakfast, and everyone , kids , adults , and in-between's thought it was great ...we tosted it. (It almost has a sour dough taste)"
2,"A Treat on a GF Diet. But, Beware!","Although not exactly as I remember raisin bread, it's a welcome treat after so long without. It has a good texture, toasts well, but could have more cinnamon flavor. It is somewhat pricey, but I miss bread, so I splurge a little.Update: I need to warn consumers that, although this packaging should last until the expiration date, you must examine this bread before you use it. At $44+ you can't eat this bread too fast, even though it is light. As I got to the last three loaves, I noticed mold on most of the slices. I hoped none was tainted that was already eaten. It was well before the expiration date. I now have too much of a distrust of this product to order it again. The Ener_G company took the bad bread back and will send me replacement loaves. They asked why I didn't order from them. From now on, I think i will. It can't be any more expensive. This price is no bargain."
4,Better than expected!,"This product really surpised me with the taste.Most gluten fre bread thati have tried are very hard to adapt too.Amazons service is great had the package in a few days. We,ll done like doing buisness with this onlineprovider."
3,Too bland and heavy,"This raisin loaf would be much more palatable if it were of the light variety, if not made with a touch of cinnamon. Unless I toasted it, smothered it with ""butter"" and agave syrup or some such other spread, I found it to be really heavy and virtually tasteless. Great idea, though."
3,Disappointed Again,"My favorite Mary Jo Putney books are about characters fighting their own flaws(Rake and the Reformer). Once again, she's given us a depressing story about characters fighting extraordinarily evil and appalling circumstances, being victimized in excruciating detail.Like ""The Spiral Path"", the reader is more depressed than entertained(I guess for our own good),and is given descriptions of sex rather than romance.About the only saving graces are that the book is a bit short, and the dour Michael Kenyon makes just a brief appearance. I guess I'll just go back and pull out my tattered copies of her earlier paperbacks."
2,What Has Happened to Mary Jo Putney?,"Mary Jo Putney used to be one of my all time favorites because her characters who had depth. Like many readers, I reread books because I fall in love with the men and women. In ""The Bartered Bride,"" Mary Jo picked an interesting plot, full of possibilities, but it was boring! It had no magic, no zing! Although there was plenty of sex, there was no passion. I found myself not caring about either of the protagonists. I knew I was supposed to feel sympathy for them and suspense at the various trials the hero underdoes, but I didn't. I read the first 60 pages and just scanned the rest of the book. It was almost as if this novel was written by the numbers by an author who was herself not particularly interested in her characters but had a contract to fulfill. Writing is a magical process and for the last couple of Mary Jo's books, the magic has been missing."
4,One of her best,"Mary Jo Putney has added another book onto the list of must reads. No disappointment here. From Australia to the East Indies, pirate ships, slave trade and of course, the happy ending. The story is fast paced and I couldn't put it down; a book to grab off the shelf and add to the shopping basket."
3,Just okay,I did not pick a better rating for this book because it starts slow and stays so predictable. You know what willHappen before the writer gets to it. There's not much you can change about pirate stories but other author's have and this story just does not make it. This is a trilogy but I will not read the other two.
3,ok not one of my faves,This book dragged a bit for me. Not sure why.....it just didnt capture my interest/ not a cant put down one. I liked China Bride a lot more.
5,One of Mary Jo Putney's best,In the romance world all to often the hero and heroine do not get together till the last page of the book which always leaves me wondering what happened once they actually got together. This book takes it one step further with a couple that obviously cares for each other and even soon realize they want to be together. but the pains of their past are hard to over come and it's very touching watching them struggle on how they can make things work. Very good and it's always nice to see members from her earlier series. The fallen angel books where some of the first romance novels I have ever read so those characters have a special place in my heart!I just wish those older books were available for download on my Kindle.
4,Sad but heartfelt love story!!,I am with those that do not like to start out going backwards when I read - I prefer to read beginning to end. However in spite of that fact Putney creates a truly emotional read with her story of Gavin & Alex. When Alex is captured and enslaved early in the story you truly wonder how she will come out of it not permently scarred. How fortunate she is that Gavin Elliot comes along and becomes her protector and rescuer - He truly is the kind of man women are all looking for. I mean he has only even had one woman in his life - unique to these stories for sure. It will take much patience and trust between this couple to ever find true happiness though. And their horrors do not end with the islands of the East - when they return to London they still have demons to fight. Of course when a couple fears they have lost each other for good that is when they realize the love they have long felt. This is truly a wonderful love story!!
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of Mary Jo Putney, having most recently finished the China Bride (which I heartily recommend), but this book seems contrived to me. There are so many plot devices: kidnapping, slavery, frigidity, surprise pregnancy (not giving much away, most of this is on the flyleaf) that the characters have to work hard to move the story ahead. Usually her work is so finely textured and the characters richly defined, but this work seemed shallow. Read it, but buy it used...!"
3,Mildly disappointing,"I had Big Beautiful Sky for a few months before buying The Colors In The Wheel. I love BBS and was hoping that Colors would have more of the same. But Venus Hum has changed their sound a bit. They've become more experimental and darker. The songs are more melodically evolved, but much of the melody is now carried by an expanded array of instruments instead of Annette Strean's voice. In fact, her vocals are somewhat more timid on Colors and she never really belts it out like she did on ""The Bells"" from BBS. I read somewhere that she had surgery on her vocal cords. Perhaps that's why she plays it a bit safer this time around. Colors is a good album, but it is a step down from Big Beautiful Sky."
3,A Little Weirder than Expected,"We loved Venus Hum's previous albums. In this one, there's a few good songs, but the group got very experimental--to the extent that some of the songs are downright annoying. The vocals, however, are never annoying."
1,Annoying effects,"The effects give the impression that there is a loose wire on your stereo. The constant pops, clicks and cutouts ruin what could have been a good CD."
3,Interesting concept that lags in execution,"The reviewer below has done a good job of summarizing the basic premise of this book's plot: a country-house party is given the opportunity to see for an instant the front page of the Times a year hence. Each member sees something affecting himself, and the rest of the book tells what each one did with the knowledge gained thereby.As a premise, this is great. Unfortunately, Buchan allows his story to become bogged down with uninteresting characters in contrived situations. Perhaps the up-and-coming politician's story was interesting to an Englishman in the 1930s, but today it seems dull indeed. Form a coalition government already! Or something! Don't agonize over what to do for months on end.Ultimately, I feel that this book fails as a thriller because it can't make the dramas playing out in its characters' lives have much meaning to the reader."
5,good product,i liked this monitor a lot. the picture is good. it's also light enough for me to carry. it was easy to hook up. i have had sony monitors before and liked them.
5,Love It,I have started to use this with my new gaming computer and i have found it a very nice product. I got it for $340 making it cheaper then the others and also making it a very good buy after spending so much on other things.I would highly recomend this and hope you get it for as good a deal as I did from this site.
3,great pictures...like the story less,"This book is about a summer at the beach, but it has a dry writing style ""In the evening, when the tide is high again, and all yor guests have gone, you row around to the point, feeling lonely..."" It is pretty wordy and my children (5 and 8) did not want a it read a second time - that is very unusual for a new book at our house. Something about the story seems boring. I would pass on this one."
5,Another McCloskey Gem,"I know that Make Way For Ducklings is the most popular of his books, but this one is actually my favorite. My 4 year old loves it and has since he was 3. We've been reading it for over a year and he still asks for it frequently. Some people may think that a book like this would be too slow moving for kids today, but i don't agree. It's a great book. And if kids never experience anything but fast-paced, television style entertainment how will they ever get to enjoy the simple things in life."
5,Great Childhood Memories,"I have fond childhood memories of my mother reading this book to me. Although this story is written in prose, there is an undeniably poetic quality about it. I have not read through this book in years, but I hope to be able to read it to my kids someday."
4,Not like the hardcover I grew up with,"I grew up reading the hard cover version in the 80's, and this paperback version is a far cry from that gorgeous book."
2,Bounces off the surface,"This book seems as if the author hasn't seen Linux in 3 years. Though it covers a lot of topics, it doesn't really go in depth on any of them. The networking chapter isn't too bad, but the X Windows section is definately dated. I wouldn't recommend this unless a user just wantes to find out what Linux is. Definately not the best Linux book avalible. I had to have a friend translate part of it from German just to understand how Modules are controled."
4,Helpful for a healthy & Gluten-Free diet,"I am unable to eat gluten, and while this cookbook is not entirely composed of gluten free recipes, a majority of the recipes are gluten free and if nothing else it will give you many great ideas on what you can eat that is fairly easy to make.The only reasy why I didn't rate it 5 stars is because I agree with how some of the ingredients are hard to find (to be honest I am unsure what some of them even are) but please do not pass this book up just because of that. Everyone, including myself who is a graduate student with no time, can use this book to cook a healthy and yummy meal."
3,More pictures would be nice,"This book has tons of recipes but I was disappointed when I recieved the book because many of the recipes do not have pictures. For me, pictures are essential to cookbooks because I like to see what the dish looks like. Because of the lack of pictures, I don't look at this book much and have not tried many of the recipes. i should add that where there are pictures, they are nicely done. The book would be greatly enhanced if there was a picture for every recipe."
4,Music That Will Leave A Smile On Your Face,"This 90-minute PBS show from 2002 provides a good variety of bluegrass performers, young and old, male and female, and leaves you with a smile on your face.Being someone who is only somewhat familiar with bluegrass, about the half the performers were new to me, mainly the older folks, but I found them to be the most fascinating and fun to hear. Then again, you can't go wrong with famous folks like Vince Gill, Earl Scruggs, Bruce Hornsby, Alison Krauss, Ricky Skaggs, Patty Loveless, et al. I particularly enjoyed Mr. Scruggs who can still pick `em with the best even in his old age. I would like to have heard more from Gill, who had a small role here, because this guy is one of the best guitar players in the country.Last, a plug for the audience. As corny as this may sound, I enjoyed seeing the wholesome-looking faces of them. Obviously, they loved the show. I watch so many blue and rock DVDs that I'm not used to seeing an older crowd like this!"
3,Great music spoiled,"Poor processing/filtering ruins several of these great recordings.The three Tatum and first Monk sides are the worst examples. Sounds like you are listening through a cheap telephone receiver. Although Bud Powell fares somewhat better, clearly the high frequencies struggle to overcome a heavy-handed filtration process.A mediocre DELTA/LASERLIGHT product."
3,Sad,"DF-D was one of the greatest lieder singers ever, but this collection contains only recordings he made when he was too old and the voice was gone. The musicianship is still there, but the tone is not. Very disappointing. If that doesn't worry you then it's a nice collection."
5,ENTERTAINING,This book kind of started off slow but gained momentum really quickly. The suspense was building and the climax was definetely worth waiting for. Highly recommended. Another Spindler classic!!!
1,I like extra cheese on my pizza - not in my books,"This is the first negative review I have ever taken the time to write. The book is about 500 pages, which is about the same amount of times I rolled my eyes while reading it. The cliches are so deep you might want to bring a shovel to dig your self out. The syrupy sweet friendship the story revolves around is totaly unrealistic. The plot was about as hard to figure out as a Scooby Doo cartoon. The characters were stereo-typical - the dumb pretty one, the tough one, the very normal average one... are we watching Charlie's Angels ? Or maybe an episode of the Power Puff Girls ?If you're looking for a VERY easy read, that will not challenge you in any way, you'll enojy this. The story idea isn't bad, it could have been a good book. I'm sure there are many people that will like this book. The author and I just have totaly different ideas about what makes a good book good. Why did I bother to finish it ? If I start reading a book - I'm going to finish it."
3,Slow start with predictable ending,"Having read Ms. Spindler's recent novels, I decided to read her older works. I checked out Shocking Pink from the library expecting a suspenseful plot. Instead I thought it was slow at the beginning and the plot was predictable. It was just an okay read for me."
2,Not up to the quality of her other books,"I just can't recommend Shocking Pink to anyone, unless they have too much time on their hands and nothing else to do. The opening sequence, set in the past, dragged on for WAY too long. So much so that I was about to give up on the book altogether, and it is very seldom I put down a book without finishing it. But it finally segued into the present, and it did pick up from there with a good story and more interesting characters. (although as one other reviewer notes, the three leads are stereotypes.)Once you're done, there's not much explanation of WHY the killer did what h/she did in the past, just a flimsy premise. Read something else of Erica Spindler's, pretty much anything else, and you'll be better served."
2,Badly written,"I wanted to like this book. The plot is promising, but the whole thing is so clichee ridden and the cast so two dimensional that I had to call it a day after 60 pages. I think it would have appealed to me when I was 15."
3,easy read but not rivoting,"This book was an easy read. The action kept moving, and I always wanted to go onto the next chapter. However, I felt the writing style was a little bland after reading other authors with more of a flair for words (particularly my favorite - Dean Koontz). I wasn't shocked by the end as I probably should have been. I figured out who the killer well before it was revealed. The characters were interesting, but Andie seemed a little wimpy at times.Overall, this is a fun read. If you just want an easy page turner and don't care about writing style, then this would be a good book for you."
2,Miss Spindler's Work Leaves Much to be Desired,"Shocking Pink, although it kept my attention, reads like a cheesy murder mystery. The book in itself was not too bad, and the plot could've worked. However, this writer is not ready for the big time, I suggest she tries again."
3,A Good Character Study,"Although I found this book to be interesting, well written, and the characters worth caring about, I didn't think it was one of Erica Spindler's best books. Though the storyline is sexually explicit and deals with an adult theme, it was done in a tasteful and inoffensive manner.What kept me turning the pages was not necessarily the murder mystery itself, but rather the intricate and sometimes cloying relationship between the three young girls who grew even closer as they grew older. All were obsessive regarding family and loyalty due to various happenings in their own family dynamics. I had to keep reading to see if any of them would develop a life of their own.I did figure out the mystery before the end and wasn't the least bit shocked. That notwithstanding, it was an engrossing story....hard to put down."
2,Slow and just ok...,"Having read a few other great Erica Splinder books, I was disappointed reading ""Shocking Pink."" It went too slow for me and seemed longer than what it should have been. Not my favorite of this authors."
4,Shocking Indeed!,"This book is the very first Erica Spindler book I read. I have been a fan since, and gone through multiple copies of this book.The book introduces three friends, and takes you on a wild ride through something they involuntarily step into as teenagers, and believe me, the ride doesn't stop once the author brings you into their adult lives.I don't want to give much away about the premise of the book itself, as I think it is important to read the tale in its entirety to get the full scope of this story.Erica paints a very vivid picture and takes you deeply into the frightening depths of the scarred mind."
2,One of my favorite authors,"But this book is terrible. Had it been my first read of hers, I'd have not read any others.The characters are unbelievable. The writing is bad. The plot...meh. A total disappointment from a tremendous author."
3,Lacking in insight.,Although this book provides some interesting reading for an experienced mother it would be dangerous if it fell into the hands of a new one. The author continually advises against falling in love with your little one and seems to ignore their feelings completely. This is contrary to what most new mothers need. Beginning mothers need to have their feelings of love and devotion validated not ridiculed. The author uses examples like a mother giving up drinking soft drinks for breakfast as an example of a sacrificial mother. Is this a bad thing? Is there anything wrong with our children being the catalyst for positive change. There is a lot to lear about mothering but this book offers a mother nothing.
5,Louisiana Grammie,This is a great first year toy. It really grabbed our great granddaughters attention. The noise seemed to bother her mother but the baby loved it.
3,Fun to play with...for about 5 minutes,"I bought this toy based on a review in a parenting magazine. It's really cute and well made but the bottom line is, the novelty of it only lasts a few minutes. Invest your money in something that will entertain a baby for longer, like the box."
3,Content,Much bigger than I had expected. At 11 months our daugheter is just getting into putting things into containers so this is perfect for this stage in her development. It would be better if the arms moved in response to her putting the balls in. I wonder though if she wouldn't be just as thrilled with an empty Tupperware container.** This toy broke after one week of use. My daughter didn't really even play with it but after a week the 'laughing' (which my husband finds incredibly disturbing) occurs at random. I'm not sure what went wrong but this toy is in the trash. There are better toys out there both quality and educational-wise.
3,Worth the smiles you will get!,"Again, another cute toy and for the giggle factor-it is worth the purchase. It certainly isn't rocket science and offers virtually no educational value but is well made as my son carried it around by one ""leg"" or another from room to room.Overall-3+"
3,not very fun,"I bought this for my 6m old for christmas. Now I know she can't really play with it yet. But all it does is make some music and legs wiggle when you push the fish button and it's a bowl for balls. I thought it would dance and sing when you got the ball in the bowl, but it doesn't."
4,Great start to this trilogy...,I really enjoyed this book. Bailee & Carter are both virgins & don't have much clue on love or romance. It's fun watching them discover each other as well as themselves. Carter is not your typical hero. From the beginning he is very shy & quite but it plays into the story very well. You may see him as a weak person when he gets beat up a couple times but I still liked him. Bailee is a little bossy but if I were in her shoes I'd have to set some ground rules also. I highly recommend this book & can't wait to read the next.
4,A truly sensual story,"This was the book that made me a Jodi Thomas fan. It was very sensual and I mean that literally, not sexually. Carter's silence and Bailee's attempts to understand him without words took the story down some interesting roads. Their physical interactions were so present and sincere. I cheered for them and it was a charming story."
5,Couldn't put it down,"Finally a romance that keeps you reading. It is different thanthe usual- because the characters are so unique. I've been a romance reader for years and now it's hard to find a book with enough pizzazz to keep my interest. I remember some earlier JodiThomas books and they were great, so I was happy to try this. Keep the murders and mysteries- give me a happy ending every time. Thanks so much, Jodi. Hope the other romance readers enjoy as much as I did.Now I am going back to see which of your treasures I missed!"
1,crappy -junk,"this thing fell apart as soon as i took it out of the package,do yourself a favor, go to walmart & buy their's it's only a couplebucks. i had to redo the ends & fix it myself. also the cord is toothick to thread the eyelets on the rim."
5,Top Notch,"I saw Special Consensus play live in Cody, Wyoming last night. What a great show! These guys have it together for sure. The CD is first rate, highly recommended."
2,sound quality of mp3 download is poor,"I agree with all other reviews to date regarding the quality of the music itself, but be aware that the sound quality of the MP3s are poor. The machine that ripped them must have been under stress at the time as there are numerous skips and dropouts throughout the album. Listen to the audio samples. The imperfections are representative of the entire recording. I personally find it quite distracting.It looks like the album is now out of print. I would recommend trying to get your hands on a used physical CD."
4,Kicking Through The Glass Ceiling,"As a young Filipino-American pursuing a career in higher education, I enjoyed reading Shattering the Myths. According to the data shown, women have clearly moved forward in attaining undergraduate and graduate degrees but continue to be underrepresented and underpaid in many career fields. Why must women follow male-dominated standards to gain equal status? Our reference point for business practice revolves around a male-centered referent. Changes must occur in our entire world of operation in order for women to attain economic and social justice. Collectively society can reinvent current organizational models of leadership. In the new model, ""tokenism"" must be discarded as the organization moves toward a deep commitment to and an appreciation for a woman's assets and her personal contributions."
4,Even my hard-to-please husband likes it!,"I think the best review of this CD came from my husband when he said...""I can't believe I'm saying this, but this CD is really growing on me and I'm singing to it!"" (This is from a dad that has barely tolerated other kids' CDs...even the really good ones!). And our kids also sing along in the back seat as we listen to it over and over and over. Her voice is very soothing yet the songs are very upbeat. I highly recommend this one."
1,Ugh.,"I honestly don't know what everyone else sees in this book. I've tried to get through it multiple times and just can't. The style is painful, and reading it is like watching paint dry. If you're determined to read this, get it used."
4,Ryan is awesome...but this book is a little weak.,"I'm familiar with Ryans' ""art"" work, and it truley is inspiring. So I bought this book and got a bunch of his logo and design stuff...which is cool...just not exactly what I was looking for."
5,"As Soon As I Finished It, I Wanted to Start Again!","This book is mesmerizing, compelling, and beautiful. It is simply astonishing that it was all written by one man. What a marvelous read! My only complaint is that it should have cost more! I feel so guilty that I got so much for so little."
1,Not heat resistant!,"I was disappointed when the bristles on this brush melted in my saute pan as I used it to swirl butter. This was before the pan was truly hot and the butter was just beginning to melt. There is no way that this brush is heat resistant to 400 degrees as it states in the description. Otherwise, it would be a very nice brush for cold applications."
4,Near perfect...,"Isn't refreshing to hear music not associated with pop. That's what I consider this album. Refreshing. It reminds you of years gone by. That is because it sounds like others, as has been pointed out. Is that bad? No. It's like listening to the ""Velvet Goldmine"" soundtrack thinking new classic Bowie music had been created. It just makes you happy."
5,Introduce the Hives in time...,"I was sure introduced in time. If you put all these new hyped bands together (Strokes, BRMC, etc), The Hives are probably the best, along with the White Stripes. Why? Because they sound fresh. So they may not be ""new"", and they sound like the Stooges crossed with the Monkees, but who cares? It's still great. I love the mood of the whole record and I'm not sure if there's a favorite song; they're all GREAT. My new favorite band? Definitely worth the title, since they are w-a-a-a-y better than most punk bands out there. 'Veni Vidi VICIOUS' indeed."
4,good,"This is punk, and it is swedish punk, but it's also excellent rock & roll. Minimalist and free-spirited, makes you want to jump around and tell everybody you don't give a..."
3,Hate to say I told you so,"There's an intelligence and sense of humor at work in the Hives that makes even their most generic moments stand out above the garage punk pack. Unfortunately, there's a LOT of generic moments, and even the charismatic crack in Pelle Almqvist's voice can't mask the sense of been-there-done-that. Still, the band somehow emits the aura of worldbeaters, and ""Veni Vidi Vicious"" offers a hint that the Hives may have a few more surprises up their collective sleeves."
3,Yay for the Hives,"The Hives are a good band. This CD is good, although many of the songs sound very repetitive. . . in fact, they all sound the same. Lead singer Pele Almquist's screaming voice ranges from amusing to enjoyable to just annoying. However, if you want to get into foreign bands (notably ones that have been americanized and aren't difficult to listen to) ot you like upbeat rock music and guys with big egos, this CD is for you."
3,Swedish Punk,"I would give them 3.5 stars...This is a great follow up band from Sweden. Northern Europe (Scandinavia)has had a facination for Punk Rock ever since Iron Maiden came on existence....For you non-Europe knowledgables, I Recommend ""The Refused"" as the recent grandaddy's of Punk'n'Rock from this country....Check them out and then you will understand...their interest in music is so different than the good ol' USA...Ry"
3,OOP'S THEY DID IT AGAIN,"The Swedes are currently proud of two things: Their own Hans Blix, Cheif Weapons Inspector for the UN, and the Hives. Hans Blix looks funny and sounds funny, but the same cannot be said for the Hives. Majorly cool, their enigmatic songs betray description. They are simply fun to listen to. A good place to start your personal tour of the Hives is in fact on this recording (Veni, Vedi, Viscious), is a tune called ""Find Another Girl"". Think Beatles + the B52s. Endlessly listenable. I hope it's not both their magnus opus and swan song all in one because I think they'll just keep getting better, better, better, ...."
3,mediocre....,"I dont really see what the big deal is about this disc, theres a few good songs but nothing on it really blows me away. Its nothing new either, the singer and the songs sound distinctly similar to two other swedish bands, Refused and the INC (who are both amazing). ANYway, i wouldnt recommend this cd...but its not terrible either, its just kinda...there. if you want to hear something similar sounding definitley check out Refused : the shape of punk to come...or the INC"
3,getting better all the time,"at first, i was, like, what??? but now, it's pretty cool, y'know? swedish punk? OK, I guess so. awfully abrasive, but that's fun. it's kinda crazy and fun to play driving out of the parking garage on friday especially when your co-workers or even the people who work for you hear it and are like what? no way he listens to that! better than the strokes, for sure. and it's actual punk, unlike every band any 14 year old calls punk, which is like a billion bands nowadays. guerre nuclair!"
3,"It's only rock 'n roll, so I like it","Yes, this cd, along with the White Stripes, Strokes, Vines are all over-hyped, but ya know what? So be it! It's rock 'n roll, nothing new about it at all, but it sure beats rap rock, nu metal, and whatever Nickelback is.But if you've only got a few bucks to spend, I suggest the new Foo Fighters or Boxcar Racer."
1,YAWN!,"Boring & Bland. Do people really think this is hip? Does anyone own a MC5 or Stooges CD? The Hives are children pretending to be men. This CD came out a few years ago, radio picked up on it a year ago and after one failed single, a terrible MTV appearance they have disappeared. Thank you o wise music god, wherever you are, you made the Hives fail in America. Let's hope the Hives don't waste time & money by making another CD."
1,Is This It? No.,"Tedious, repetitive, a headache. ""Hate To Say I Told You So"" is the only (barely) listenable track here. If you want Detroit punk, pick up ""The Day Met The..."" by Rocket From The Tombs. Cleveland is a hell of a lot closer than Sweden."
2,Ouch......,"This album is probably THE best instrumental album I've ever heard, and it's ausom how this band is from Sweden. So I always find myself thinking what a kik a** band when I start listening to the track, while the bass is rocking like crazy and the drums are doing godlike things, and then, I face sinks, as the vocals come in....The vocals in this album are the worst I've ever heard, and i really hate to say that. The instrumentals are so incredible, but this vocalist hurts your ears, and it won;t grow on you. I've tried, many times, to love this allbum, and i just can't, I wish this band would find a new vocalist so I could worship them."
