1,Never received this book!1,"I ordered this book shortly after my son was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes. I paid for this item but never got it. I emailed the seller who insisted he sent it but again, I never got it. I have purchased quite a bit on Amazon and this is the 1st time I was severely disappointed"
5,Hawson Shines as Brillian Teacher,"S. Hawson's way of explaining Spanish grammar makes it easy for anyone to understand. If you only want to buy one book in order to speak proper Spanish, let this be it!"
3,Edits,"It is terribly disappointing to get these DVD's only to find they have been edited.The entire point of purchasing the DVD sets/seasons is to watch the show in a clear, complete manner, without commercials. Also to avoid the constant nagging of station bugs (logos) in the corners, and if that weren't enough, now commercials scroll across the screen during the shows. It has become so bad, I no longer watch most TV. For TV shows I really like I'll purchase the DVD sets just to get away from the constant irritants.Yet, we don't get the full shows. Dialog is cut, songs edited out, etc. All for the sake of saving a few cents per copy, and done only to avoid literally pennies in royalties.Note to CBS: I would much rather pay a little extra per season and get the unedited, uncut versions. The show was timeless just the way it was."
2,Edited episodes really kill my excitement,"Note that season one is the only DVD containing the word 'Complete' in the title. Every other season has been butchered to remove many Jim Nabors's songs, to say nothing of changing other music, etc.It is really hard, frankly, for me to watch these episodes, because I'm just waiting for the next editing massacre, as opposed to simply enjoying what should be great entertainment."
3,How?,"How is it that people are reviewing DVDs that haven't been released, which means you can't buy them yet?"
5,Gomer,"Great Show! Classic comedy, totally (mostly) predictable but that is part of what makes it great! I always remebered that the show was just annoying when I was younger but after seeing it again I realized how funny it really is!"
2,Missing Episodes,"I swear this collection is not complete. I remember an episode where Gomer is assigned a dog to train. He ends up turning the attack dog into a family pet. There's another episode where Gomer yells hooty hoot everytime he wants to be heard by Carter out in the woods. I remember another episode with Jamie Farr from MASH was in it. I think it was Carter having a difficult time remembering his line to say-I think it was ""Let's hear for Henshaw"" And another episode when Gomer has a horse on base. I remember Carter saying when he thinks he sees a horse look in his barracks window, ""I could of sworn I'd seen horse face Dombrowski"" I have all five seasons but they don't contain these episodes yet they claim this is the complete set!??!?"
2,why oh why,"why can't anyone put out a good Thin Lizzy dvd? i have been wanting to buy one for the last several years and all i see are bad reviews on all of them. i saw them several times in states and one time in Germany. they kick ace every time. there has got to be good footage or at least some that with some effort could be cleaned up and sound quality repaired enough for us all to enjoy. sorry, i am just sitting here disappointed again."
4,Subtle and Satirical,"I chuckled my way all through this book. The humor is subtle. The satire is too. But for someone who enjoys observing human nature and behavior, the book THE TRUTH ABOUT DRAGONS was funny and somewhat poignant. At the risk of giving a spoiler, I would say, however, that the ""truth"" about dragons is more aptly the truth about humans... but then, I think that was the point.The writer did imitate a somewhat pedantic style, suitable for the voice of the dragon, given his [the dragon's] stated purpose of the story, but that didn't detract from my enjoyment. Rather the contrast of the style with what the story was actually saying was part of the humor for me.I think I would like to see other writings by this same author.I received a complimentary copy of this book for review purposes.The Truth About Dragons: an Anti-Romance"
2,So Dull,"I received a free copy of this book in exchange for my review.At the time of this writing, 3/4 of the other reviews really hit the nail on the head. It seemed interesting from the description, but it literally took until about 45% of the way through the book for the dragon to meet the girl. Everything before it was the dragon's philosophical musings and it still continues on in a similar way once the girl is introduced."
2,Tedious and slow,I received a copy of this book in exchange for a review. I found this book to be hard to read and somewhat tedious. I really wanted to like this book. I thought the original idea was pretty creative and I was looking forward to reading it. I was disappointed. The book often meanders off in long rants and weighs itself down in details. I was never able to like or feel anything towards the dragon storyteller. I got tired of his egocentricity and the portrayal of humans in general was stale. I was interested in a few of the characters that appear in the book but not interested enough to really care about the rest of the sluggish story. I feel that the story could have better been told as a short story in a more to the point and simple style.
1,Not much new material,I was hoping from the thickness of this book that it would have all sorts of useful information. It doesn't. It looks as though the author has simply gone through the Gimp's menus item by item and given a synopsis of each. There's very little material that is not already obvious.Grokking the Gimp is a better choice; it goes through several projects to illustrate useful real-world techniques.
2,Really Out Of Date,This is a big book about a version of GIMP that hasn't existed for a long time. It's ready for recycling or the land-fill.
1,What a disappointment,The author seems to have some good ideas and I agree with much of what I think he is trying to say. The problem is the man can't seem to maintain a train of thought long enough to complete a decent sentence. I've never seen so much paraphrasing in a book. It's almost as if he's trying to write in stream of consciousness. I had an easier time reading Ulysses by James Joyce! Where was the editor?He really lost me when he started bringing Darwin into scene. Darwin was not a social scientist. His writings have been used by social scientists in order to support their thesis or disparage anothers. This is wrong and very unfair to Darwin and evolutionary science in general. Most of these types have never actually read Darwin. They are simply transmuting what others have written about the subject.Don't bother.
2,A Disappointing Effort,"This book would be more aptly titled ""Musings of a Disappointed Old Man."" Lukacs now belongs to the negativist school of the modern man that has been exemplified by Allan Bloom and Jacques Barzun in recent years. It's hard to believe this book was written by the man who wrote the then insightful ""A New History of the Cold War.""Among other flaws, this book was in bad need of an editor. It reads like a rough draft of random musings and asides that never got consolidated into coherent thoughts and theses. Lukacs' vast knowledge of history seems to have overwhelmed his ability to coherently analyze and express his current fears, frustrations, and disillusionment with the state of man. He apparently sees the Roman Catholic Church as the last best hope.A sad effort from a once fine scholar and innovative thinker on 20th century history."
4,Loved it!,"Although one or two of the drawings were inaccurate, I really enjoyed the variety of birds represented in this book."
3,Disappointing,"Unless you're an expert at shading and don't care much about things being colorful, this book is fine. I found it kind of boring to color. The first several pages has multiple birds on them and the only colors I used were grey and brown. Hopefully, it gets better. Pictures are real small, too."
4,Great CD,"I bought this CD recently because i wanted to hear what Judith sounded like after leaving the Seekers.This is an example of Judiths excellent vocal talents.Its quite a good CD,some realy good gospel - Xmas songs here.Her voice is realy good here and its a very good collection of songs.There is also the surprize of a couple of additional tracks recorded in 1994.But most of the Cd was recorded in 1968.The 2 songs recorded in 1994 were Amazing Grace and Somewhere A Child Is Born.She was very busy at the time with the reunion of the Seekers as well as various solo releases.In all a very good CD,but i cant help but miss the boys in the background on some of the songs.There was alot of her albums released from 1968 up to the mid 70's.Whereas in the 1980's there was nothing at all im aware of released.This is the type of music that she sings so well."
4,Never fails To Please.,"After the Seekers broke up i never bought any of theirrecords because I had them all,but latley becuuse of gettinginto computors to support my music collection i am thrilledto have found out through e-bay,musicstack and amazon thatjudith kept on recording and I have now 3 of her recordingssince the brake up.Great Voices are worth collecting,theynever scease to please,like Jim Reeves,Eddy Arnold,Patsy Clineto name A few,And Groups like The Shadows,The Beatles andThe Moody Blues, It's a double blessing when people likeJudith and Cliff Richard give their hearts to Jesus andsing about God's Love for us and what He wants us to do sothat we too, will truly know the love that He has for us.You dont have to be a great singer,just ask Him in."
3,More terrible than death,"For people who want details about the problems in Colombia, this book is for them. It presents many names and details about drug trafficking, politics, and other issues...perhaps too many details for the ordinary reader. For readers who already have a basic knowledge of Colombia, this book fills in the details. I did not finish this book because I was looking for a more engaging story."
5,Amazon has not sent me the book yet,Amazon has not sent me the book yet so I cannot review it. I have ordered twice from amazon and as of yet I have not recieved the book and still cant tell if they have credited back my account
5,As Good As ROOR. Both Are Great Reads!,"Although both books,""this"" one and ""ROOR"" (Running Out Of Road, by Robert Appleton)are equally insightful, Mr. Kirk's book is a drug facts book, and ROOR utilizes these facts in a true crime story. Both are GREAT READS!"
5,beautiful woman-beautiful singer,"Maria Conchita Alonso is a multi-talented Latino actress and fabulous singer. Brilliant Bolero vocals PLUS the romantic gems of Mexico's great pop songwriter Armando Manzanero. Please note- this album is sometimes known as ""Alejandra"" the title of a tv soap opera in Mexico. The 2 are one and the same. Marvellous."
1,This book does prepare you for the MSAT.,The tests in this book are not like the real MSAT. The practice tests don't even have the correct number of questions. Maybe even worse is that this company uses a smaller size book and thick paper to increase the number of pages to trick you into spending all this extra money. There is no more information in this 500+ page book than in the other larger size books with fewer pages. Save your money and buy one of those.
4,A VERY comprehensive review book,"I highly recommend the REA study guide above the other MSAT test prep books. Its History and Literature sections are very detailed and provide ample review, if you have more than a month to dedicate to studying. However, if you are pressed for time, I would recommend the Cliff's Notes MSAT prep guide, which is more of an outline of what you need to know. I also found the practice tests in the Cliff's book to be more similar to those on the actual MSAT. Good luck!-C.K., student teacher, Oakland, CA"
5,Excellent Review and Tests,I found the tests prepared me for the exam and would highly recommend the REA. There are slightly fewer exam questions on the current MSAT than what is presented in the REA book. The reviews are thorough and well done. The best book of the ones I looked at.
3,good pilates workout,"I was sort of disappointed by the bellydance portion of this DVD. I watched a youtube performance by Dawn before purchasing, and was looking forward to getting this DVD, but her form is not always correct (ex. her head bounces back and forth a lot during the 3/4 shimmy). It uses a fast techno sort of beat instead of middle eastern music, and the moves are not always in time with the beat. During the hip drop section she'll be counting by 4's or 8's, but doing 5 drops... The voiceover, music, and movement just don't always match. I wouldn't recommend this as an instructional bellydance DVD for beginners because of these problems, and an intermediate dancer will probably find the moves too simple. That said.. I really enjoyed the pilates workout section of this DVD. It's challenging, enjoyable, and short but still effective. I'll add it into my workouts."
4,MMA Magic,"Rickson Gracie, the world's greatest fighter, leads the way in Pride's first event and in one of it's greatest cards ever assembled. Stunning knockouts and submissions fill this event. Rickson Gracie shows the world why he's ranked number one. And his cousin Renzo puts on a memorable display of fighting prowess and incredible offense from his back. Highlights are Oleg v Goodridge, Dixon v Murakami, and the aforementioned fights."
5,deWALT Stands out!,"In my opinion, this tool exceeded my expectations. From the price it had then when i bought it, to the way it performs the work. Speeds up the process of (whatever you are tightening/loosing up, like in my case it was an addition to the house). The fact that it also hammers it down when the screw, for instance, has a hard time going in, - is definitely a winner. ""Factory-Reconditioned"" - i did not notice anything that would actually look like it was reconditioned. Looked very thoroughly - it's the new product. Absolutely recommend this product! But, you might have to consider the project scope. Working all day - i have ended up waiting a bit for battery to recharge because both had died and there was not enough time to recharge. And, that's because batteries are not XRP (XRP helps a lot). But, for medium to small sized construction work - this is perfect!Also, you might want to ensure you also have the actual drill as well. This one is not a drill. It's a motorized screwdriver."
2,Pretty but useless when you're a walker,"I studied this map two months before I went to London for the first time. This map made me think it's a cozy, easy-strolling, pretty, understandable, doable city.Once I was there, when I started trying to navigate using this map, I learned that it had created an illusion of simplicity. It was actually quite useless, as it gives the names of the bigger streets, and omits the tiny myriad side streets.The Tube map should have been integrated into the map, but while the map shows the stations, you don't get the sense of which stations connect. You need to have a Tube map to do a side by side comparison, constantly.I wound up buying a London A-Z map which gives every tiny alley, notes every dead end. The A-Z is ""too much information,"" but it does not attempt to sugarcoat and obfuscate. My recommendation, based on experience: buy the London A-Z and a compass, as there are few North-South streets."
5,An essential for travelers new to London,"After searching several travel and trip sites, reading the recommendations of others, I purchased the London Knopf Guide and the Paris Knopf Guide for our first journey abroad. These books are exceptionally clear, sized for your pocket, and highly recommended. Truly indispensible!"
3,so so guide map,"I would consider this map more getting acquainted with the layout rather than for actually using it during a trip. It is very big to take it on the road (remember, you will have to carry it on your back for hours on end) and it will not fit on a regular pocket.I would consider instead a laminated map (which these are not) that can get wet and folded into a tiny or at least more regular-size map"
2,Give this one a pass,"It seems like there are more guides to London than a person could count, but that means there are some substandard ones among them. This is one that offers very little. The main problem is that it lacks detail, and gives only a cursory explanation of the limited number of subjects that it covers. The maps are good, but that's really all this book has going for it. And since you can get good maps from other places, there's no need to buy this book just to have a map."
5,Great bachata,"Bueno senores puede ser que ustedes nunca hayan escuchado musica de ""El Canario del Amargue"" y si esto es el caso por favor no demoren mas. Este joven bachatero esta entre los mejores. Es decir si ustedes son aficionados a la musica de Raulin R, Antony Santos, Frank Reyes por mencionar algunos ponganle en la lista tambien porque su bachata es igual de buena y muy romantica. Lo que destaca cuando escucho su musica es el ritmo. Siempre es muy pegajoso y bailable sin perder la pureza del dulce sonido. Tambien, vale mencionar que tiene una dulce voz y canta con sinceridad que es el toque de belleza, un rasgo distinto de todas sus canciones. Si quieren probar su musica primero aparece en mucha de las compilaciones de ""Aqui esta la bachata"" pero se lo garantizo esto es bachata de la buena que llega hasta el alma."
4,Deerskin - Soft!,"Got these the other day to replace a pair of unlined deerskin gloves I loved .... and lost. :)On plus side, these are very nice, well-made gloves; leather is as soft as I've seen.They're well worth their price.On negative side, leather is a little thick, and, they *do* indeed run a hair small.(So if you often find your gloves are a bit tight, would order the next size larger)BTW.. No notation here on Amazon, but FWIW, these gloves are manufactured in China.."
5,My hands get cold very easily due to medication I'm on.,"I have tried several types of gloves and these do it all: good looking ,warm without being bulky and inexpensive too."
4,Nice gloves!,"I really like the finish of these gloves and the color is a perfect match for my coat.The only concerns I have so far is that I'm worried about durability (they're already pretty scuffed up).Also, please not these are pretty small on me so if you have large hands, you might want to give them a pass.I'm updating this review a year later to report that my concerns about durability were unfounded. The gloves, while scuffed, are still completely intact and still keep my hands warm."
5,Wonderful Gloves,"The gloves look attractive, feel soft on the inside and the outside, and keep my hands warm... they also fit exactly as I hoped they would. This is a perfect glove, and a bargain price."
4,Battery was dead,"My husband is generally happy with with this watch, but when he opened his Christmas gift, the battery was dead. Our local jeweler fixed it quickly and inexpensively, but I was annoyed that a gift I gave was not working. The watch is good looking, working well, and the price was great."
3,"Good beat, but just couldn't dance to it.","Get married, inherit the money, and help the woman who raised you live for a few more years. Only, in the middle of the plan, the unexpected happens. You find yourself in love.It sounded great on the back of the book. It even sounded great for the first few chapters. And everyone else is right - Jacob is a hero's hero. Strong, competant, rich. He takes in strays, makes them well, and sends them on their way. Strength with compassion.Where I get caught is with Claire. I just didn't like her. She was weak. She ran away from her problems. She married Jacob, a complete stranger, to protect her. She avoided further scandal and sheltered herself away from life.She doesn't come to Jacob as a woman on her own. She's needy. Dependant upon him to protect her (which, by the way, he doesn't do very well).It was a decent read with a good plot. But without being able to identify with the heroine, the book was just flat for me."
3,A good read but not one of her best,"Jacob West has to get married-and fast. And what woman wouldn't want to marry a handsome, kindhearted business man such as Jacob? The search has proven to be harder than he had first anticipated. He's already lost one prospective fiancee but now he has his eyes set on his beautiful, temporary employee, Claire. However Claire has problems of her own. She's hiding for her life and looking to Jacob for protection.JACOB'S PROPOSAL is the first of three books by Eileen Wilks all centered around the plot of three brothers who must marry in the shortest time possible. While this book is a good read and kept my attention to the end, I found the characters a bit hard to identify with. Claire strikes me as too prim and proper, not an extremely likable character. Jacob, despite his good looks and charming characteristics, doesn't come across as strong as he should be to me."
3,"Vintage Hammer. Babes, severed heads AND Peter Cushing!","The fist time I saw this movie, at the tender age of 10, it left a lasting impression that has no doubt skewed my view of the world. Here was a former Playboy Bunny trying desperately to contain herself in a typical Hammeresque period costume, running around the Village exacting revenge in a series of bloody murders. The grisly climax contains a scene where she talks to the severed head of her (former) boyfriend. She was, of course, Frankenstein's newest creation. I recently watched this again, curious as to how I would react 30 years later. Aside from a terrible ending (this movie doesn't end so much as it stops), the movie still holds up pretty well. Fans of the Hammer genre, and fans of Peter Cushing will no doubt enjoy this one. Good wacky laboratory sequences, a fun cast of characters (some of which you are glad to see die) and Denberg as the best looking creature yet."
3,An entertaining entry in the Hammer Frankenstein canon,"Frankenstein Created Woman is one of the better of Hammer's Frankenstein sequels, an efficient programmer that sees Peter Cushing's Baron trapping the soul of his guillotined assistant and putting it in the body of his disfigured girlfriend, only for the wronged boy to use her to kill those who really done the crime he was executed for. There's more build-up than payoff, but its very sedateness (indeed, almost cosiness) is part of the pleasure, and it's hard not to warm to the Baron's arrogance and aloofness, whether it be reading in the witness box or casually answering a policeman's ""Do you take us for fools?"" with a simple ""Yes."" Still, it is remarkable just how well preserved that severed head is after six months...The extras package is okay but not outstanding: trailer and TV spots (for its double-bill release with The Mummy's Shroud - ""Beware the beat of the cloth-wrapped feet!"") and an episode of the World of Hamer clip show."
3,Do you have anything in a redhead?,"That evil genius is up to it again! This time trapping the souls of the recently departed or decapitated and transplanting it with beautiful ferocity. A young man loses his head....over a disfigured young girl, who in turn throws herself over a bridge into the frigid waters below. The good doctor (Cushing) and his inebriated partner, (Thorley Walters) collect her body, and his soul. And viola' REVENGE. The most interesting scene is where the monster keeps the severed head of her boyfriend on her nightstand. (Thank God we have polaroids) to each his/her own. You gotta see it widescreen."
3,Cushing created Hammer.,"Peter Cushing as the Baron.This time,Baron Frankenstein starts off with another bizarre experiment.He intends to take souls from fresh corpses,and give them new life,in another body.In order to do this,the Baron,and his colleague Dr.Hertz,need two fresh corpses.A bizarre string of events unfold,and inevitably,the experiment takes place,with mixed results.Without the presence of Cushing,it's average in every respect.For the film,3.0/5.The picture quality on this disc is excellent,no defects at all,no grain.Sharp throughout.No problems,4.0/5. The sound quality is also without fault,a Dolby Digital (Mono) track is sufficient to re-create the classic Hammer feel.3.5/5. Overall,a reasonably entertaining film,certainly not Peter Cushings best outing as the Baron,but a great transfer from Anchor Bay,maybe one to at least consider for Hammer fans.And remember,even bad Cushing,is good."
5,A must see for Peter Cushing fans!!,This was the last purchase for me to complete all Peter Cushing Frankenstein movies he done for Hammer Productions. A must see for all Peter Cushing fans and of the Frankenstein series he made. They don't make these well made classic movies anymore in my opinion and anytime you can get your hands on one as they are slowing being released on DVD is a pure pleasure.
2,Frankenstein Creates a Boring Woman,"The most interesting thing about this DVD was that it wouldn't play on my DVD player. When it was inserted into the Sony 7000 it said ""Insert Disc"". But it plays fine on my PC. Was it a quirk or the curse of Frankenstein? Speaking of ""The Curse of Frankenstein"" that's the Hammer film that I want on DVD; it's a classic rivaling the Boris Karloff films from the 30s. As horror films go this one won't make it past mediocre. If you can sleep without a night light there's nothing here that will horrify. Another turn off is that it violates truth in advertising. Susan Denberg appears scantily clad on the front and back covers leading one to believe that she might reveal something of herself in the movie. Hardly! She spends all of her on camera time dressed like Grandma Moses with a cold. Keeping her boyfriend's head is a touch that Mary Shelly would have appreciated. When her husband Percy drowned she cut out his heart and kept it with her for the rest of her days."
2,it wasn't what I expected,"To be fair, I didn't really know what I was getting... but if I had seen it in advance, I doubt I would have bought it."
4,Pretty Good Video About Health,This video is pretty good at describing how to take care of your body. I own almost all of the Trevor Romain videos and this one is my least favorite. I plan on showing it to my 3rd graders anyway and hope they find it entertaining and educational.
4,"Great music, short album","I bought this album wondering how the african music would combine with latin music. Having listened and hating Mundo by Ruben Blades I was hoping for something better and Ricardo Lemvo gave it to me.While only a few of the tracks are actual danceable salsa, each and every one felt great. The combo rhythm songs have a great sound and good melodies even if not well suited for the dance floor.The only bad thing here is the CD only has nine tracks with 40 minutes and it left me wanting for more."
2,bad picture,"The picture is a little misleading. It only ships with 2 of the metal clips, and they are only the tabs that thread into the straps. Not the whole assembly. But the shipping was fast."
4,"Good, but not as good as the original.","We like this DVD, but it doesn't hold my 10 month old's attention like the original Baby Songs and More Baby Songs."
3,Not sure why everyone liked it.,"I bought three video cassettes from the ""Baby Songs"" series: ""Baby Songs"", ""More Baby Songs"" and ""Baby Songs - Animals"". I did this because of the wonderful recommendations from the other reviewers. Now that I have them and I have tried several times to get my child interested in them, I have no idea what got everyone excited. The lighting/colors of the videos are not so great, the songs on other videos I have seen are much better quality, the kids themselves don't sing so you have more of a background song with something on the screen and my kid never really found these cassettes attracting. The only reason I rated the cassettes 3 stars instead of 2, is because the songs are still of good quality and there are lots of children on the cassettes. Who knows, maybe my son will start liking these cassette when he grows older (he is now 2 and loves all the other song cassettes)."
3,Not a favorite but tolerable.,"Positives -Happy & friendly, none of the harsh sarcasm seen on many kids cartoons nowdays.Soothing on the nerves of a baby and mommy sick of Barney and puppet shows!Nice background for keeping playtime mellow or white noise for napping in a busy house.Negatives -Video isn't very interesting, very generic. My son adores animals but he snored through this.Songs are VERY VERY long and complex for baby songs. Itsy Bitsy Spider congradulations, your epic adventure has been imortalized with this new ballad of your saga! Good luck learning them all I get the warm fuzzies being right occasionally while singing this with my baby, but we aren't exactly video freaks.Should be called toddler songs not baby songs, my baby showed very little interest in this video til he started teetering on the toddler stage."
3,"only 30 min, not nearly as good as Baby Songs - ABC, 123, Colors & Shapes","Our 23 month old has been watching Baby Songs - ABC, 123, Colors & Shapes for several months now and absolutely loves it. I bought this dvd because I thought she'd love it just as much. Unfortunately, it only somewhat holds her attention and it's much too short."
1,Major disappointment,"My 9 month old LOVES the original ""Baby Songs"" but this ""Animals"" version just doesn't live up to the rest of the collection ... it is significantly shorter than ""Baby Songs"" and it is nowhere near as upbeat. It doesn't hold my attention, nor his!"
3,Alien psyche nyet - Empire paradigm da,"If you expect nothing much from the author this military SF is it. The story starts good and falls flat fast. Cold Beams are juvenile and the story is an attempt to formulate an empire/warrior/scientist/technician paradigm, unfortunately so much was left out that it is a very flat read. The insect species were so lightly treated that they only are relative through the readers familiarity with Earth insects, yet our insects could not support themselves in such a manner. Thus, it did not work for me. Secondly the reptilian? race is also lightly treated, mostly what you have is a 'Samurai' type mentality used in the book. Unforgivable lapses in space travel, time dilation, and How the heck did the insects track the Tzen to their home planet? Many more lapses. Better Choice is C. J. Cherryh's 'Faded Sun' Trilogy. If you wish a more modern warfare paradigm try, John-Michael Phillips' ""The Marauder Chronicles. Thanks, Harry!"
2,Great Plot falls flat,"while I loved the idea of this book I just did not enjoy reading it.It was not the dry humor that turned me off but the dry writing style. The plot was clever but it did not move along quickly enough to keep my interest. It moved in quick jerks interspersed with long winded passages about nothing. I found it repetitive (as some ""journal style"" novels can be) but most of all I felt that it was a bit on the pretentious side.The writing was very stuffy and verbose which is too bad because the creative plot would really attract more readers if the writing style was a bit more available to readers of all backgrounds."
3,"Good story, tediously written","I loved the idea of this book; there's nothing like a good send-up of the academic world. But it was the writing style that turned me off. While I'll admit my vocabulary expanded by leaps and bounds the further and further I read, it started to feel a little pretentious, and the story didn't move along quickly enough to keep my attention riveted. But, if you like extremely dry, prosaic humor, you'll enjoy this book."
2,JAG SIXTH Season,"I was delighted to receive Season 6,8.9,10 as it is a product that I love and I have all other season.So it was with dismay that I was unable to play the DVD's on my Home Video due to region issues, this should have been something that should have been brought to the purhaser's attention at the time of buying. I am able to play it on the Pc however this has restrictions also in that I am able to change the setting of the region only three times I want to be able to see all video on both my DVD player and LAP Top and there should be facility to do this. Afraid to send the items back as I may not be able to get them here in the future. Hopefully technology will change."
4,Jag,One of the few TV series that holds my interest and has a cast that melds well. Most of the newer shows may be OK but not worth my money to own.
4,Megadeth is back!,"With a new studio album, an upcoming live album and this DVD, Megadeth is back with a vengeance! This DVD is an extended version of VH1's Behind The Music. The TV-show mostly featured the earlier albums, but here you get it all, inc. the uncensored video of ""Moto Psycho"". High improvement over earlier videos released by the band, such as ""Rusted Pieces"".A must for everyone who loves Megadeth or thrash metal in general!Minus: Only released in the US and Canada. Zone-free player required."
1,Dangerous Soap,"Make no mistake, this stuff is real soap, not some ""kid's soap"", my son got some in his eye, (he clapped his hands together and it squirted out of his hands right into his eye), and within seconds his eye area was swollen to twice it's normal size. Flushing with water for 20 minutes worked, (but not something you want to do often with an active three year old.I think that there needs to be a much larger warning on the product."
5,Great Read!!,I have never read the Caitlin series and I'm not really interested in it..I loved the Chloe series and read all of the books in about a week...I think this book teaches a great lesson and I feel like I can really relate to Chloe. GREAT BOOK!!!!!!
5,unexpected great color,"When I paint my toes with this color we refer to them as hershey toes. I've also done a reverse french manicure with this on the tips and it looks like the nails are dipped in chocolate! Surprisingly, this color goes with a lot. Dark chocolate base with a little subtle gold sparkle."
4,An unconventional journey,"As with many women's novels, this one centers on a search towards 'having it all '- but the protagonist, Madeleine Fox, certainly goes about it in an unconventional and adventurous manner.So many people only fantasize about reinventing themselves in another part of the world, and Fox's quest takes her on an exciting journey full of passion, political intrigue and lots of soul searching.For anyone interested in China, this book provides keen insight into the lives of some typical Chinese people in Shanghai prior to China's economic expansion, dramatically contrasted with those in Hong Kong during the massive boom there in the 1990s, just before the handover to the mainland.There are also some colorful anecdotes and descriptions of other parts of Asia.In all, a moving story about a complex woman's search for the most simple, yet satisfying, things in life.The book could have wide appeal, though mainly to women."

2,keeps breaking,I have bought 3 of these already and they all keep breaking in different spots. These are not very durable. I'm not even hard on my clips.
2,Great Price-Tight fit,"Would consider this a good deal, if it lasted more than three days.It fit and held the phone very well. However the first fall off a coffee tableto the tile floor broke off the belt clip, making it useless."
3,Works well - Not very duarble,I was happy with this until I grazed it against a door frame and it broke apart and would not stay together after that.
2,Not as fun as it looks,I purchased this DVD for my 2 yr. old hoping to see tractors in action. Instead both of us were bored with it within a few minutes. Although it contains information about the history of John Deere which is probably interesting for Deere collectors this DVD is not fun for little ones. I would instead recommend Fred Levines Farm Country Ahead DVD. It's really entertaining and educational.
2,Not worth it,"I ordered this plant and it arrived a week later. The plant was dried out and the packaging was inferior to other packing materials other online sellers use. The leaves were yellow and had holes in them. I have been trying to coax it back to health, but it does not seem to be responding. I paid $7 for the plant and $5 for shipping. I contacted the seller over a week ago to tell them my displeasure but never received a response. Not worth spending another $5 to ship back. Would not order from here again."
3,Not Sure What to Make of This Book,"This book is vastly interesting. Giving Storytellers specific rules about the nature of the dreaming. But the problem comes in the books scope. The dreaming is not defined very well. Like the Near Dreaming is a reflection of our world, so how do you travel from the near dreaming to the Far and Deep Dreaming, there is no eartly bases. Also you get the idea that the Dreaming is HUGE, so most of the locations they give are completely meaningless because there can be many more inbetween. Just a weird book, which I would recommend, but not with my usual vigor."
5,A World of Treasures,"This book has been the biggest help in story telling players through the mythical world of the dreaming. Not only does it give an ST a clear idea of how to run a world that is only vaugely described in other books, but it provides a general reference to how the dreaming fits in with the cosmologies of wraith, werewolf, mage, and vampire. While there is still the typical changeling emphasis on story over game rules, this book gives a great skeleton for STs to build their own Dreaming. The reworking of the Dreamcraft art is also much needed and worth any player checking out if they intend on using it with their own character."
2,Biased Presentation,"With the five star reviews I hoped to get a completely fair and balanced presentation of the world's religions, but what I received appears to be biased towards Christianity. I say, ""appears,"" because the differences between presentations are very subtle, but compare how positive the pictures are between the section on Christianity and Buddhism and I think you'll see the difference. Maybe it was too much to expect a completely objective overview in a children's book. The book is still usable to teach children with, but requires a bit of explanation to insure an equal treatment. However, if you are Christian you should be very happy with this book."
2,misleading title,"This book should be renamed Religions of Asia and the Middle East. Granted, of the religions it covers, it does an admirable job (which is why I give it two stars). However, Africa, Australia, and North America get one page each, and most of Europe and South America are ignored entirely."
5,Everything You Need In One Book,This book is an excellent book for anyone in the child-care field. Everything you would need to know and how to do it is in here. This is a must for an early childhood teacher or even assistants. I definitely was not disappointed in this book at all. I would recommend this to anyone.
3,buen comienzo en la salsa,"nayobe hizo un buen comienzo en el ambiente salsero con este cd, pero creo que quizas para su proximo cd de salsa pudiera mejorar un poco los soneos y añadirle un poco mas de sabor. con esto no quiero decir que este cd no esta bueno, al contrario esta sabrosisimo."
2,Totally disppointed!,"I am very disppointed with Dr Karen Jobes's 'Esther', because hardly found exegesis on the literary features and structure, making her work lack of text analysis and aesthic quality; furthermore no fresh insights from the book's exegesis and application portion. The fact is Esther is very much a text favoured by exegetes who expounds so much insights with close reading and ideological reading strategies.I strongly doubts the ability of Dr Karen as exegete especially her exposure in current paradigm of biblical interpretation."
4,"Basic, necessary","After living and working overseas for 12 years I have decided to return to the USA and must update my wardrobe. I bought 2 books: this one and Dressing the Man by Alan Flusser. This book is broken into 3 parts: Get Job, Succeed in Job and Get Better Job. Each section reviews the issues of dressing pertaining to that particular category. Basic stuff but necessary for the younger inexperienced man. This book's strong point is its explanation of the 4 dress codes: Corporate, Casual, Business Appropriate and Business Casual Appropriate along with business travel, entertainment and sales meetings. Its weak point is its lack of elegance and sophisticated masculinity. For that please see Alan Flusser's splendid book Dressing the Man."
3,The best book on the market for how to dress in 2006.,"The book is probably the best book on the market for how to dress in 2006. I purchased this book to compete with the younger business crowd in interviews. I find it exceptional on style representation of how men dress. It does not emphasis the uniform of an office. It lacks empahsis on the male tendancey to expect everyone to show involvement by dressing alike. I call this the socially conditioning of men to follow a uniform dress code. I suspect this comes from all the socializing in sports acitivites. It is both a signals of member of your team and the oposing team. How you dress in work especially corporate America has major implications on how you are viewed in your work place. I suggest adjusting your style to each circumstance: work, play, social life to give the best impression"
5,Thank God!!,This book has it all. Thank God some one can tell us how to dress again. I am tired of picnic casual in the work place!!Great book to share with a buddy!!
2,Rubber pad doesn't stay stuck down.,"The lower part of the pad on the curved part was unstuck when I received this pod clamp. I glued it down, but then the upper part of it came unstuck. This is disappointing considering how expensive this item is!"
2,"The American Pope, the life and times of Francis Cardinal Spellman",Mr. Cooney obviously leans left and can see no good in anything that Cardinal Spellman ever did or said. His bias is obvious and severely damages his credibility.
2,The Cardinal Was Not His Favorite,"John Cooney had it out for Cardinal Spellman right from page one. I don't think there was any other reason for writing this book except to bash Cardinal Spellman. I don't think there was ONE good thing he had to say about the Cardinal. He went out to find the worst in him and whatever else Cardinal Spellman may have done that WAS good, Cooney made sure he made it look bad. He made Cardinal Spellman out to be the worst, most despicable Catholic cleric ever upon the earth. And I think it must be mostly untrue and very unfair. Sure, lots of politics, lots of religion. They don't always mix well, but Cooney just didn't like Spellman's brand of politics mixed with religion. Religion won't get you anywhere. Just remember, 'it's not what you know, but Who you know'."
5,Martha's finding her voice,"To me, this is the foundation for much of which was so brilliantly realised in her later albums. It's interesting to hear,for completeness, our heroine try to find her voice and her style with these tracks which evolved so beautifully later on.It's in no way therefore as complete or sophisticated as her later albums but it gets 5 stars for 'Dis moi..' alone-the last track on the album, which I heard for the first time live and nearly wet my pants..."
4,Egg platter collector,"These are the cutest, I am a deviled egg tray collector and I loved thesetrays along with the matching tidbit trays. I gave them as gifts at Christmas to a few friends, complete with the deviled eggs!"
2,Nice but misleading size,"I bought these shoes after reading all the 5 star ratings, none of which warned me that the shoe actually loosens up after you wear it once. So the second time I wore this pair it was so loose that I could'nt even walk. Its a pretty pair of shoe and quite comfortable the first time, would not recommend it though but if you must buy it after reading all the misleading ratings, you must get atleast 1/2 a size smaller to wear it more than once. BTW I ordered in size 8."
3,Don't slip through the toe hole!,"Absolutely gorgeous shoes, but way too open in the toe. I could imagine myself slipping through the front of the shoe before I walked outside in them. I usually try foot petals, but they'd be too easy to see since the toe area is so revealing. I'll stick to smaller peep holes for peep toe shoes."
4,Gorgeous Shoe,"Great price on a really stunning shoe. My boyfriend, who is usually pretty immune to shoes, gave these a second glance and even a ""nice"" comment. I wear a larger sized shoe and have really sensitive feet, and I think these will be OK for the event they are intended. I don't think I'd spend a full work day in them, as the twist in the front does push in on my toes a little- it would probably feel more than ""a little"" by the end of the day. Nice matte satin- nothing cheap or shiny looking. All in all, they are true to size and tolerably comfortable. Sexy enough to get the second look, but classy enough for even the most formal of functions."
2,Guang Ping Yang Tai chi Chuan,"The only good book on the subject of Guang Ping Yang is Guttmann's translation of Kuo, Lien Ying's 'The T'ai Chi Boxing Chronicle' and that book is not for beginners. The poster who recommends Yoga and comments rather ignorantly about Guang Ping suffers from a standard misconception about the art. Although it is a gentle healing art, the healing comes as a result of good steady practice and is a result of the internal balancing that occurs from proper use of energy. This is a demanding study. Tai Chi Chuan is an internal energy boxing art much aligned with Bagua and Shing-yi. It is one of the more difficult of the Tai Chi arts to learn because of it's need for years of training and practice. In it's higher good it is nothing less than alchemy or transformation of the individual from lead to gold."
3,Dated material,"This book has some useful general information on Kuang Ping Tai Chi and Tai Chi in general, but contains references outside of the realm of Tai Chi that suggest a new-age blend of thought and practice. One very odd aspect of this book is that the male players all sport the long hair and unkempt beards of the Hippie Era, but the book was written long after that period ended. It makes the photos hard to take seriously today. One should be forgiving with this book, however, as it is very dated. It is one of the only sources (not the best, as someone pointed out here) of written information on this style of Tai Chi. A good teacher will serve one much better for learning Kuang Ping (also called Guang Ping). If you only have a casual interest in the subject, this might be a starting place, but most of this information is available online at different Guang Ping/Kuang Ping Tai Chi websites."
3,"Old, funny pictures. Difficult instructions","I trained in this tai chi style and found it quite difficult (not like the long-form Yang style I studied before). I thought the book might help, but it was a bad call.Not only are 1960s hippie pictures hilarious, but they really don't show the movements quite well. Still, the writing about the meaning of tai chi is pretty good.There are many good videos out there, and I recommend that instead of getting a book."
2,"""Stitching"" Does Not Hold Up","I was disappointed in this ball, as my doberman had the ""stitching"" peeled/pulled off the ball within hours. I would recommend Orbee's other products that are made out of one continuous piece of material over this ball, which was easily destroyed by my dog."
1,Waste of money,"This toy came recommended from other lab owners as tough enough to withhold typical play. This toy didn't last four hours with our two dogs. They are typical retrievers, but no more aggressive chewers than most. We are extremely disappointed and will never buy another Orbee Tuff ball."
2,"Good light, but they truly need to work on reliability","Powerful light, fascinating very accurate design, a lot of features. But the construction is not very reliable. The bail at the end of the light's clamp is very thin and easily broke after a week of riding. Also you have to be very careful when you thread the light's head. The O-rings on the light's body are very thin and the head has a very sharp v-shaped rim. If you slightly misalign the head when threading, the O-ring can be easily sliced apart."
4,"to see, not just be seen....",This is the best light I've used.First ride at dark with it last night and it wasn't like riding with a spot light when encountering obsticles and things in the path.
2,Save your money,"As an advanced woodworker I decided to try my hand at turning so I purchased this book based upon the other reviews. The book is written in a confusing, disjointed, and rather condescending manner. Conover seems to want to impress with his ""expertise"" at the expense of clearly disseminating information.Additionally, photos are extremely small, poorly cropped, and show no worthwhile detail. He states that a minimum entry level lathe will cost you over $1,000. That must be Canadian dollars since he recommends equipment as if he's employed by the Canadian Department of Commerce. There are numerous run-on sentences in the book that will leave you scratching you head and asking ""what the hell is this guy talking about?""If you want to get started in turning, this is not your book."
3,ERNIES BOOK,"This book appears to be excellent for accomplished turners. I am an absolute Green Horn. Photography is excellent, writing crisp. Lots of information on handmade accessories and sharpening tips.I probably need a book about basics."
4,The Lathe Book,"It is a good beginners book. All of the parts, basic tools, and basic operations are explained."
2,An INCOMPLETE Guide,"If you just bought a lathe and are looking for instructions on how to turn a spindle, find another book. One of eight chapters is on technique. Cutting a cove, the most basic technique, gets two pages. Not included in this instruction is where to place the tool rest. In a ""complete"" guide, I expect some step by step instruction. I own at least a dozen Tauton books, and this is the first real disappointment."
4,awesome,Just a short time since I've been using this product & the bags as well as dark circle under my eyes are already well diminished.I'm also very happy to know the ingredients are potent & natural
4,Worth it!!,"I have always had really bad dark circles under my eyes. Nothing really seemed to help. I've used a bunch of different products that either irritated my skin or just didn't work. I decided to buy Teamine and I have seen noticeable results!! It's a bit pricey, but you only have to use a little bit twice a day so it will last a long time. I've been using it for about 3-4 weeks and I can really see the darkening starting to go away. It's also smoothing the skin under my eyes and just making them look brighter overall. I would definitely recommend this product!!!"
2,Not sure yet,I have not seen any change yet but I am not giving up yet. I am only 31 years old and look young everywhere except for my eyes. Very puffy and starting to have circles as well.My dermatologist recommended so I will give it a few months!
2,Teamine eye comples,"Of course it may be too soon, but this product did not work for me. In fact my eyes look more puffy. Perhaps, I'm allergic to the ingredents."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this product from my dermatologist and was very disappointed. I used the product twice a day for a week and had a really bad reaction. The skin under my eyes became very red, dry, scaly, and itchy. I stopped using the product and waited for my skin to heal and then tried the product again. I had the same reaction the second time after only using the product for two days.I understand that some products will cause an allergic reaction in some people. But I expect that for a product that claims a money back guarantee and costs $50 that I could return the product if I had a problem. Neither my dermatologist or the company would give me my money back. I wrote to the company several times describing the problem and offerig to return the unused portion of the product, but the company never responded.Don't waste your money on this product, the company's money back guarantee doesn't mean a thing."
5,Best eye cream I've tried,"I have tried dozens of eye creams (Origins, Arbonne, DHC, and practically everything at the drugstore) and this is the most effective cream for me. I noticed it at my dermatologists office and they recommended it. Amazon had it a lot cheaper so I bought it here. After a few weeks, i noticed results. It really reduces dark circles and puffiness. The longer I use it, the more results I see. It definitely is designed to use over time, morning and night consistently."
3,Good for dark circles but I still have puffiness,I have been using Teamine for about 5 months. I bought it mostly for the puffiness under my eyes although I do have dark circles as well. It has lightened the dark circles but never really took away the puffiness. I am still on my first jar and use this twice a day so a little does go a long way.
1,Five Weeks and Nothing Yet,"I've been using this product twice a day, without fail, for 5 weeks. I see no difference at all. Sad! I am 27 with moderate dark circles and puffiness, and.. still 27 with moderate circles and puffiness! So continues my never ending quest for a good eye cream."
2,Ok product no changes seen.,"I purchased this eye cream and had high hopes for wrinkle reduction. I use it 2 times a day and have seen little to no results. I recently went to a class and they suggest Emu Oil. Bought it at a health food store for $9 and have seen GREAT results! I'd buy the Emu next time, it's all natural, no smells, super gentle and actually puffs up skin to reduce wrinkes..."
4,Works very well,"My dermatologist recommended this product for me, and this purchase was my second container.I have very dark circles under my eyes at all times, and although this does not eliminate them, it does reduce them so I don't look like I have a black eye.It also reduced the appearance of the fine ""smile"" lines around my eyes. I like the texture of the cream, it soaks in quickly and works well under makeup.Overall, I'm happy with the product. If I am ever able to find a product that worked even better on my dark circles, I would switch. At this time, this is the best I have found."
3,dark under eye circles,"this product says it takes 1-2 months for a reduction of dark circles and puffiness, its been over a month and so far nothing has changed. a healthy hue is supposed to appear. if there is a hue i can't see it. supposidly after 3 months there are very significant results and then you have to go on a maintenance regimen. in the end i think i wasted $50.00."
1,Are the two Teamine Eye Complex products the same?,"I have purchased Teamine Eye Complex before from my physician's office. The jar had a black lid. When I was comparing the two Teamine Eye Complex producs offered by Amazon, the containers looked the same. All the info was the same that I could determine. So - I bought the cheaper one. When it came, the packaging was similar, but the jar had a silver lid instead of the black one which is on the more expensive product. The silver lid was not displayed on the less expensive product on Amazon. A silver lid on the less expensive product would have indicated to me that the products were not exactly the same.So - now I question if what I ordered is a knock off of the real Teamine Eye Complex?"
5,This Stuff is Amazing!,"Teamine Eye Complex is wonderful and the results are amazing! In just one week, I noticed a reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, including crow's feet. Just be sure not to use too much at one time as it may cause the skin under your eyes to become scaly or flaky.My mother, whom I hadn't seen in about 2 to 3 months, came to visit me about 5 days after I started using Teamine and she asked me if I had recently had a face lift! Nope, I had just started using Teamine! It's great and I highly recommend it!!"
2,stuck with it for a year and no significant change,"I have hereditary dark circles and a hereditary wrinkle under my eyes (been there since I was a kid) that puffs up often. I saw a slight change at first but nothing significant. I stuck with it though as a part of my daily regimen, and a little over a year later, I think my eyes actually look older. I switched back the neutrogena eye boost at 1/5 of teamine's price and my eyes looked 5 years younger in minutes. I do need something for the aging I am seeing though so I am going to try restalin silk since boost is really just a quick fix. So my final review of my product is that I ended up in the other 50% that it doesn't work for. My recommendation is try some samples first and if it's working pay the $50-$75 for the pot, don't go for it right away because it doesn't work for everyone."
1,Did not work,I purchased this product at the doctor' office. I found it to be a waste of money. The product did not work for me at all.
5,A miracle for the dark circles that come with aging!,"My dermatologist recommended Teamine for the dark circles I am getting from the damaged capillaries that leak around the eye as a normal part of aging. A tiny jar has lasted over a year. I used it twice a day at first, and saw improvement in about two weeks. I usually use it once nightly, but if I forget for a day or two, I can really tell the difference! This eye cream also hydrates the skin around the eye leaving the skin smoother and softer. I didn't really realize what a miracle it was until I ran out, now I will not let that happen ever again!If you have dark circles I highly encourage you to try Teamine, if you are consistent in using it, it really works!"
3,Does not diminish anything,"My dermatologist recommended this eye cream and gave me some samples. I decided to purchase it mainly to diminish my dark undereye circles. I have been using it for 2 months morning and night. The Revision website states the product will:*Visibly diminishes dark under-eye circles*Smooths the look of fines lines and wrinkles*Firms and brightens skin and provides antioxidant benefitsThe product did none of these things for me. The only benefit was softer undereye skin (so I gave it 3 stars), but I think any moisterizer (for a lot less money) could do the same. In all fairness, I do not think any product can diminish my dark circles, but I had hoped to see less fine lines/wrinkles and better skin texture with this higher end product - I did not. I do not recommend this product and will not be repurchasing it."
3,Expensive,"Been using for about a month. It was recommended by my dermatologist for dark under eye circles. He told me that it was a tad pricey and that it may or may not work for me, but that he had heard positive comments from other patients. I will not purchase again."
3,no miracles,"Okay, it goes on smoothly and feels nice, but I've not noticed any improvement in puffiness, fine lines or dark under eye areas. Perhaps I'm just hoping for too much? I've been using the product for three months now."
3,Its working,This was highly recommended by my dermatologist. It makes me feel rejuvinated. There are several out there on the market; but this is ideal.
1,Didn't work for me,"After having read the reviews, that this stuff really works, I gave it a try. Am still working it, and will till the end of the jar. Am doing only one eye so that I can easily compare. Have been using it for a month, twice a day. No difference at all between eyes. Color me sad! It obviously works for some people, so that's great."
1,Yikes!,"I,too, had a bad reaction to this cream. I have used it for four days and my skin around my eyes appears burned and baggy. Not the look I was hoping for with this expensive cream. Beware your aging skin!"
2,Used for over a year-no change,I used this product in the hopes it would diminish the dark circles under my eyes. I have used it daily for over a year now and I see no difference in the dark circles. It works okay for wrinkles so I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. I could have saved a lot of money. My recommendation...try something else.
2,Average eye cream but does nothing for dark circles,"My dermatologist promised this would work miracles on my dark circles, but I have seen no improvement at all. It seems like a good eye cream, but no better than the eye creams I usually use. For the price, it was a huge disappointment.Pros:Emollient eye creamMoisturizer temporarily helps small linesCons:Does nothing for dark circlesNo better than most eye creamsExpensive"
3,Good for the price,I bought these a month ago and then had to replace them with a new ones because one of the speakers started to sound weird. These are good for the price.
4,"A wonderful, warm, walk through the woods of the human soul.","I read this book as a text in a undergraduate psychology course. I highly recomend it to anyone interested in psychotherapy, what it is like to be a patient and what it is like to be a psychotherapist."
3,"A delightful spotlight onto both ""sides"" of therapy","I read this when an undergrad in psych - now a practiceing therapist, I re-read this book every year. It helps remind me I am human - that hubris really is something to attend to quite often. The therapist-client relationship CAN be a partnership with both bringing much to each session. I read this book before Yalom's ""Love's Executioner"" - I enjoy them both equally. I keep loaning my copy to collegues, and now have to order another one!Mim"
3,Pales by comparison to Yalom's Love's Executioner,"This book has its high points, but I happened to read it alongside Yalom's Love's Executioner (which also relates therapy sessions) and couldn't help being blown away by the latter far more. The Taboo Scarf is in general less thought-provoking and the language used is also one that seems would be more suited for a mystery fiction novel."
4,An absorbing book from Philip High,"When Peter Duncan returns to Earth after years living among a highly advanced alien species, his homecoming prompts fear and paranoia in the tiny elite ruling the Earth.Duncan is not the harbinger of an invasion of Earth, however, but he has a mission on Earth that is far more profound than never-ending warfare.The plot is fast moving. The characters are well drawn. I wish this story could be adapted to film.Choose this novel over his ""Time Mercenaries."" The gorgeous cover art is a nice bonus.Highly recommended because it is both highly entertaining and thought-provoking, just like all good science fiction."
3,Not very Durable,"Lining for this bag is not very strong. I received this bag in November 2012 and the lining is starting to tear already. Then yesterday I was reaching for my keys in the outer pocket and the pocket just started to tear where the pocket is joined to the bag. It is really a cute bag, however just for these issues I would not buy another. I was disappointed."
5,Great Item,I bought this item and i wasnt specting such a great product. I really recomend it because it has really good materials and looks terrific.
5,Best flower essence book out there period!,"I have owned this edition as well as the previous edition of this book for quite some time. It is without a doubt the best of the best in terms of information and how to's regarding flower essences. The next edition is due out any time now, and I can't wait to get it. I believe it is supposed to be a two-volume set. It doesn't matter if you are a beginner or experienced in flower essences, this book will become a treasure in your library of flower essence books."
5,Brilliant Wholistic Healing Guide,"I adore the work of Patricia and Richard, their integrity and love for healing others really shines through this book (and through Patricia's other work Flowers that Heal), it is such a fulfilling read, especially if you don't just read the book but work with using flower essences to help you work on yourself."
2,movie,"Although this movie arrived on time and was nicely packaged as well as works great, I have nothing but good things to say about the seller it is the video itself that stinks.As a parent with many many Baby Songs videos as my daughter loves loves loves them. This is by far the worst. It is old and has very old music. It is nothing like the other Baby Song videos. THe quality stinks and it does not have the original singing and/or little videos.Do not spend your money on this video. you could make a better one in your backyard."
1,A terrible production but great songs,"The video has very little to do with the songs. The video is a type of poorly produced and poorly directed series of sketches of people doing things. However, what they are doing has very little to do with the music. There is a connection, since the video has items similar to what the songs are considering, but the connection is not in rhythm and misses the point of rock and roll altogether. The video does not rock to the music. So, watching the video does not inspire the little one to dance. This is a cheaply made and cheaply put together video that is way below standard. It is not worth the price."
3,Disappointing,"The first thing you have to notice about this performance is the lack of Chris DeGarmo. Sure, Kelly Gray is a good guitar player, but he is not DeGarmo! Visually, this DVD disappointed me because the stage show was very simple and the band wore all black (how original!). From an audio standpoint, the band has played a lot better! Maybe it was the small venue, or maybe it was the sound system, but whatever it was, I thought the songs sounded...well, wrong. Queensryche is a very talented band and their live shows are normally great (e.g. Operation: Livecrime), but this performance is lacking."
2,"No Harmonies, Pathetic Crowd....","And these people are from Seattle with their hometown band? The crowd is pathetic, come back to Wisconsin and record a live DVD, we'll give you all we have as an audience at EVERY show.Geoff Tate hits the notes, he just need Chris DeGarmo back to back him up with his soaring vocals a la LiveCrime, then you have a perfect show!"
5,Queensryche Live Evolution,If i could only have one Queensryche dvd this would be it! The guitar work between Michael Wilton and Kelly Gray is at it's best here.Well worth the money.
2,inspectors failure,Purchased a DVD of Gunsmoke the second season volume #2 and first two disks played ok. The 3rd disk would not play at all. Checked and dvd player was fine so it was the disk. Wonder why someone mainly an inspector diden't play all the disks once before shipping them to a customer. They would have probably seen the 3rd disk diden't work. I will admit Amazon was great about the return process and said I could do it either way of two way. Refund or a new DVD. So I don't fault them just whoever recorded the disks for failure to ck. product for ok-ing it to be sold and shipped!
5,Gunsmoke Season 2 Vol @,"This is classic TV at its best. The transfers are beautiful, the sound is excellent and show, what can I say. This is television the way it was meant to be. I only hope they continue to produce this series until the end. I see so many vintage TV shows start off only to be pulled after one or two seasons. I for one will continue to buy these releases regardless of cost of how they are split up. Lets face it, the studios do not have to release these wonderful shows on DVD. It is just a little extra cash for them. So they can pull the plug anytime they wish. So fans, lets keep supporting the release of this and other great TV from the 50's and 60's."
4,"The Missing Season 2 Episode, ""How To Cure A Friend""","One of the 20 season 2, volume 1, episodes, ""How To Cure A Friend"" (1956), was mistakenly replaced by the season 4 episode, ""How To Kill A Friend"" (1958). Since season 2, volume 2 has 19 episodes, I had hoped the missing show would be included as a 20th bonus episode, completing the season. It was not. Hopefully, CBS will release it in the future."
1,I`ll be buried on Boot Hill before I see all the episodes.,O.K. the first season was released in July. The first part of season two was released in January. Now the second part of season two is available in May. At this rate the whole series will be out by 2027.
1,Classic western... more multi-volume nonsense,"An obvious 5 stars for Gunsmoke and one star for the continued over-priced split season nonsense.Will only buy complete seasons...Fortunately, all seasons of Wild Wild West were each released complete and at non-inflated pricing (just purchased 3rd season West at $25.99/1211 minutes. Gunsmoke season 2 volume 1 at 526 minutes goes for $30.99. Season 1 (complete) Gunsmoke presently $20.99...comparative convoluted absurdity. Paramount did West right...They fumbled on Gunsmoke and Rawhide."
2,"Very fast shipping, although.....","The DVDs arrived in new condition as advertised, however, the case was cut with some sort of sharp utensil over the UPC code area then an item sticker was placed over it. The back and front of the DVD case was pushed in with compression and not handled with care whatsoever prior to shipment. The paper cover inside was torn due to the compression. This is not what I call ""new"" condition. It was given as a gift and caused some unnecessary embarrassment for me. BEWARE!"
1,The Broken-Up -Season-Sets Travesty Continues,"Well, on one hand, the releases are continuing for the greatest television Western of all time. Gunsmoke is still making it out on DVD, and old fans and new fans are able to enjoy these classic episodes.But that good news is more than outweighed by the bad news, which is that at this rate, who knows how long it will take for them to release the entire show? And if the excuse is that it would have taken 10 years to release the entire series with two releases a year, it still doesn't explain why they are breaking the seasons in half. At least if took that long to release the whole series, the buyer would have 20 complete sets, instead of the peacemeal releases we're being subjected to endure.Dodge City and its fans still deserve better, but at this point, I'm not sure what, if anything, the studio can or will do to make up for their greed and avarice."
2,Not what I'd suspected!,"I often use this brands rinses, but this particular one is more of a dye. Typically these are leave in, and this must be shampooed out - which I found out a bit too late! Regret ordering it; did not seem to alter my hair in any fashion and the surprise shampoo requirement was disappointing."
1,"Please, Stop Putting Me To Sleep!",I had to read this book for a diversity class. Sennett uses language and sentence construction that is overly ostentatious and difficult to understand. Inside this fat book is a very thin book trying to get out. He needed a good editor.
2,Classic Accents Three Way Antique Reproduction Push Button Light Switch,"Very cheaply made in China. For the price of these, I expected better quality. No instructions that told what common was, but an E-Mail to the company promptly replied."
4,One of the Best (non OST) Final Fantasy works,"There hasn't been a live CD since the ill-fated ""Symphonic Suite"" many years ago and now there is this - quite simply put a live version of some of the best Final Fantasy songs. The Tokyo Philharmonic is on every beat and adds alittle more to the Final Fantasy melodies. The MC's get annoying and their Japanese is very hard to understand. The choice of songs was superb yet there is no ""live feel"" as most of the songs are played just as you would have heard them on another Final Fantasy CD. All in all, this is one of the best and one can easily see by some of its few flaws to its real beauty - the epitome of Nobuo Uematsu's Final Fantasy work."
4,Colin Smith is wrong,"What the ""critic"" above does not realize is the author is a descendant of John Colter. Much of the information related in this text is based stories passed down through the family. While it doesn't make all the text correct, it does provide a good view of John Colter. Part of the book is devoted to friends of John Colter you won;t find anywhere else."
1,Fiction if repeated enough times sadly becomes fact.,"This is a poorly research text. The authors spent too much time trying to fabricate ""new"" information in order to sell thier book instead of creating a reliable history on the great man's life. This book is the single most damaging entity to the facts of John Colters life and the miss information has spread like wildfire to other text, internet sites, historical institutions, and periodicals of history. Readers beware, just because you read it in print, that does not make it fact."
4,The hunter from alabama,Its The Hunter again when I read the title I was like Elepant Land.? Of course you cant judge a book by its cover. Another great Tom Swift by Victor Appleton
1,A very disappointing book,"Mr Weintraub apparently has an ax to grind against General MacArthur. Mr Weintraub served in Korea during MacArthur's sojourn and this is really his personal version of events during that conflict.As Mr Weintraub is generally a respected historian, I was disappointed with this mendacious approach to analysing MacArthur's role in the Korean conflict. He overfocuses on MacArthur's regular work day, his lunches, his supossed eccentricities and the fact that he likes to watch old movies every night (who doesn't?) and then, pow,links this up with bad management of the Korean conflict. The coverage is also uneven, with some individuals, namely a female reporter, being mentioned several times.That's what the Korean conflict was all about - to Mr Weintraub.I wasted my money."
2,Biased and disappointing,"A better title might have been ""Weintraub hates MacArthur."" This biased, one-sided book goes out of its way to present MacArthur in the worst possible light. Typical is the statement that the general ""had no interest in anything but his wife, son, and reputation."" Or the ugly dust-jacket blurb calling MacArthur a ""windbag."" Consistently the author goes from unwarranted assumptions to foregone conclusions, always blaming MacArthur, even for decisions originating in Washington. Although the text evidences considerable research, the overall effect is marred by the author's obvious prejudice as well as by numerous minor factual errors--I counted at least eight. End result: poor history and boring reading."
2,A Hatchet Job,"I am a Korean War vet, although I did not see combat. I was aware during the war of the comments about ""Dugout Dug,"" and there were episodes when Korea was not MacArthur at his best; but there were also many when he was brilliant. But Weintrab's book is a miserably unbalanced hatchet job. The purpose of the book is not to present an unbiased reporting of MacArthur and Korea, but rather a somewhat lawerly like case to establish that he was nothing more than an egotistical,incompetent publicity hound waited on and served by fawning sycophants. It is unfortunate that a recognized author such as Weintraub has not presented a measured and reasoned report. For much more balanced journalism I suggest ""Old Soldiers Never Die"" by Geoffrey Perret or ""American Ceasar"" by William Manchester."
5,Good Book for Beginner Astrologer,"If you are just learning about astrology, you will find this book very helpful. Mr. Arroyo has broken the book into easy-to-understand sections. He even has a chapter on how to use his book! The ""Contents"" section starts with the four elements of the 12 signs and progresses to ""The Planets"", and then to the ""Planets in the Signs."" It then delves into ""The Houses - Planetary Guidelines"" and ""Understanding Planetary Aspects."" This book is simple and easy to read, but it is full of information helpful to someone who is serious about astrology. Very good book for a beginner with some knowledge of astrology."
4,Useful reference book,"This book is brief in it's descriptions, but covers alot of territory and is very understandable for non astrologers. I would definitely repurchase as a gift."
1,A dissapointing book from an excelent writer,"I understand I will be quite alone in this list of reviews. All the reviewers have rated this book with 5 stars...I have everyone of Arroyo's published books, and this one is definitely not even close to his usual standard. It is a completely usless and out of fashion cookbook product in the style of Margaret Hone's Textbook, although I would say that the late Hone work is far superior. I cannot see how a seasoned astrologer could profit from it, and for the beginner I am sure there are far better works, to name but one, Basil Fearrington's The New Way to Learn Astrology is by far a more useful and quite better book.As far as it comes it seems that Mr.Arroyo has already said everything he had to in his wonderful older works. If the author wouldn't had accustom us to such excelent books, I may be less harsh on this one. I just cannot."
2,"A sweet ballerina, but only a mediocre corps","The first part is better than the second part. Particularly interesting was the Nutcracker before he changes. There are mistakes made and the video shows these mistakes, such as a someone on the wrong side when the curtain comes down. While the performance of the leading lady is fine and the leading man, other than that, performances are mediocre at best. I recommend the Nutcracker by Mikail Barsyshonikov which is definitely better."
4,Quantitative Evaluation,Audio Merits:7/10; Video Merits:7/10; Cinematographic Merits:8/10;Musical Merits:10/10; Overall Artistic Performance:9/10;DVD Extras:7/10; Recording Total Quality:7/10. Professor's Recommendation:Best Nutcracker performance until the release of Baryshnikov's version.
1,"Hello, Iron Curtain!","This very traditional version of the Nutcracker is stiffer than the tutus in it! It has some redemption as a document of the vast size of the stage in the Bolshoi Theatre; but lacks imagination in sets, choreography, and costumes. One wonders how many decades the costumes have been reused, and what a more current production might be like. It was a chore to get through it."
5,Superb!,"First of all I can't understand why they say it is not for kids. Why should we give them pink lemonade entertainment(like San Francisco version)instead of real gem?This performance is superb. The way dance blended with music is amazing. There is subtle humor and brilliant acting. It perfectly convey Hofmann's spirit. Stage set is simple and it doesn't distract your attention. They say it is dated. This music wasn't composed yesterday either. Anyway I prefer this sets to tasteless opulence of San Francisco version. Well, picture is not crisp and you can see it was filmed decades ago. However, it is the best Nutcracker you can get!"
1,Sound quality is unacceptable,"If you don't mind listening to music on a transistor radio (circa 1960s) then you'll enjoy this DVD. The sound quality is the absolute worst I have ever heard in the past 20 or so years. I played this through a high-end home theater system and it sounded no different than listening to it through a conventional TV with all the bass and treble completely turned off. This DVD is worthless. I guess the old adage, ""you get what you pay for"" is true. At just under $10 bucks I should have know something wasn't right. If you buy this for the ballet, go for it. But if you buy it primarily for the music, don't."
4,Compare / Contrast,"I've recently compared two beginners guides to getting published. Here are my thoughts on them and my thoughts about which you should purchase.THE EVERYTHING GET PUBLISHED BOOK by Meg Schneider and Barbara DoyenThis book is a bit more somber and realistic. It gives hints and solid suggestions. I think I would title it ""The How Not To Get Taken On Your Way To Getting Publish Book"".THE COMPLETE IDIOT'S GUIDE TO GETTING PUBLISHED by Sheree Bykofsky and Jennifer Basye SanderThis book is more motivational. It might allow you to get the most enjoyment out of your writing.Which one should you purchase? Both. If you are serious about writing you need to treat it like a job. Both of these books are tools that will help to guide you. You need all of the input you can find. If you find another writer ask if the two of you can get together to swap ideas. This will also help. The odds of a beginner getting published are not encouraging, but what a thrill to try, and sometimes you succeed."
1,what is this,you might tell people exactly whats in it you can't tell whats in there by the picture. I might buy it if I knew whats in it!!!!!
3,Thought was nice but didn't turn out to be,"The only reason I bought this CD 'cause CD 1 was mixed by DJ Taucher and I'm his fan. But overall this CD is a disappointment. Especially, CD 2 mixed by DJ Pi. DJ Pi's mixed tunes failed to inspire and captivate me in anyway. It's becausehe mixed club-house w/ hints of progressive sounds and I didn't like it. Plus I thought DJ Pi's mixing was some what off! However, DJ Taucher CD is a really nice. It's filled w/ deep andatmospheric progressive trance. Not a really big fan of this style but it worx 4me here."
5,The best Coffee available on the market!!!!!!!,"We used to live on the East coast where this coffee was readily available. Now we live in the Mountains on the West coast. This coffee was truly missed by all and have provided it as gifts for many family members and friends! Every one of their flavors is truly amazing in taste and aroma. They are not fake, bitter, or burnt tasting at all! It is so much fun to order and try all the flavors! We also love the single packets which are perfect for 1 pot! No wasting or guessing on how much grounds to put into the filter!Thank you Amazon for making this available online. Please bring in more flavors! Arbuckle's hands down, is truly the best!"
1,The Real Truth,The real point of the story is in Mr.Decker It is the story of someone with a beef against the Mormon Church. The problem is his efforts will fail.
5,Awesome,It works great! I love the size and the cover is thick and very durable and can be washed as well
1,Heats unevenly,"I have used -- or tried to use -- this heating pad for about a year now, with inconsistent results. Sometimes it puts out heat but usually it doesn't. It gets barely warm, and I can lie on it in a thin T-shirt and not get enough heat even on the highest setting. In the shower, any heat around 130 degrees is too hot, but I turn the heat on this heating pad up to over 160 degrees, and most of the time it barely warms me. I called the company to complain, and a representative said he would send out another one at no charge, but as of yet I haven't received anything from them. Very disappointing, and I'm about to order another heating pad from another company, as I need almost constant heat for my painful back."
1,26 x 14 Thermotech heating pad will not heat,"I purchased this product approximately one month ago and after using it a few times, it has quit heating. The thermostat and timer still light up, but there is no heat at any temp setting. I have tried various combinations of heat temp and timer but to no avail. Now after spending good money on this junk, am I even going to be able to get a return?? Very disappointed in Thermotech. Have used many of their products, but will stop if this is their quality now."
1,defective heating pad upon arrival,"I just received the thermotech digital heating pad (king size), took it out of the box and it did not work. Very disappointed. Unfortunately, I was not able to get a replacement heating pad from Amazon, because the product was sold and shipped by HelioLiving. It would have been nice if they tested it before shipping the heating pad. The only option provided on the on-line return system was to send the defective heating pad back to Amazon for a refund. I guess I will try to buy the heating pad in a surgical supply house."
3,Maybe too hot??,"My wife ""likes"" it because this pad gives far more heat than anything she has ever used. BUT she does not like that it stays on for just an hour. She decided to keep and use it but she found another at Walgreens that she prefers."
1,Do not buy--totally disappointed,Although I bought this heating pad in March 2011 we had seldomly used it. It does not work at all now--not even a year old! I have tried different temperature/time settings thinking that it might work at some setting(4 settings). Out of luck--no heating at all!Total waste of money. I should have bought a less expensive plain heating pad from a drug store rather than spending a lot more money on this fancy stuff made in Taiwan. I had bought an inexpensive electrical heating pad five years ago--it is still working.
2,"the other review are correct, the size is not as advertised","The 26x14 is actually 24x12. 4 square inches may not seem like much, but it makes a world of difference for those of us with serious back problems who need full coverage on the back.I have yet to see how effective it is. And maybe it would allow more coverage combined with the neck and shoulder heating pad. BUT, truth in advertising is important. Since there have been other reviews pointing out the same problem, healiohealth (the seller) should be taken to task by Amazon for not changing the product description. They have been made aware of the problem (several times according to the reviews).I assumed (mistake on my part) that they would have addressed this by now and my order would be different. Nope....Not good customer service or selling practices."
2,Fit was dissappointing fir shoulder use,I just received this prd and found that the fit was pretty poor for the shoulder. Its advertised as a shoulder wrap but it barely covers the front deltoid muscle nor does it cover the side of the shoulder.....all it does is heat the back and top.....
1,I wouldn't recomend it to anyone,"Moist Heating Pads - TheraTherm - Digital - Rectangular Blanket - 14"" x 27This has got to be the worst heating pad I have ever used. The controls give you a timer and also various heat settings, the lowest being 113 degrees. And the timer is in 15 minute increments. I purchased this for my lower back, which is pretty messed up and causes a lot of pain.So from the very beginning I set the controls for 15 minutes at 113 degrees. And so far I'm unable to leave it on for 15 minutes, it gets so hot that it feels like worse than the back pain itself. And I haven't noticed anything of moist heat. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone let alone a friend of mine."
4,Surprisingly good quality,"The best possible review of this product came from one of the people I Skyped recently, who said that the image quality (even on full-screen) was better than with another of her friends with an IMac with built in camera with double the resolution. (?!) I'm docking one star because the flexible arm height doesn't extend as high/provide as wide-angle a view as a monitor-attached camera."
1,It works....sometimes!,"Beware, had to restart computer after every other call. Phone would ring and callers voice would come out of the computer speakers at times. Rechecked all settings time and time again. Would work for one call then not the next."
5,Does German Metal Get Any Better??!!!,"From the moment the very first scream shatters the calm of the German folk music, you know you are in for one heck of a ride. I've been listening to Accept for nearly twenty years, and to this day, Restless and Wild makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. From the speed of ""Fast as a shark"" to the galloping guitars of ""restless and wild"", this album will have you rocking uncontrollably! When Accept order you to ""Shake your Heads"", trust me, you will obey. When you hear the hammer strike the anvil in ""Demon's Night"", you'll feel a chill in your bones. Accept has produced some great material over the years, and Udo's solo albums have all helped satisfy my craving for his unique vocals, but in my opinion, ""Restless and Wild"" is the one that can't be matched. As fast as it is infectious, this album is one for the history books. Not a bad song present, raw and powerful. This album will wear you out, But trust me, you'll collapse with smile on your face."
3,Thought Breaker was better,I thought this album started getting too much of the ac/dc aspects of rock and roll and not enough of the double guitar Maiden/Priest stuff.
3,Don't Believe the Hype,"Genre classic or not, it just didn't do as much for me as I had hoped, and it sounds a bit dated. Not bad...but not nearly so strong as the hype might lead you to believe."
2,I don't recommend that you buy this cd,"This cd I knew wasn't going to be the real themes, and some are ok, but for the most part it is a waste of your money. If you are a true wrestling fan, then go ahead and buy it, it's not like I'm going to stop you anyway."
1,Totally Bad!!! Themes were Totally Fake!!!,"WOW Magazine Entrance Themes totally stinks. All 17 themes songs were very bad. This CD was so bad that it even gave me a headache. The themes weren't even real. This is one of the worst CD's ever. I would recommend you not buying this CD, even if you are a true wrestling fan. Because it's just a waste of money."
3,"Better than nothing, but not that good","This doesn't let enough water through so the drain backs up a bit. It does keep a lot of hair from going down the drain, but not all of it."
3,Does what it was intended to do,"It's okay. Drains slowly. Traps debris but soap scum builds - I suppose expected. But hey, cleaning the trap is better than dealing with hair clogged drains."
1,Don't get excited about the radio feature,"Pedometer only registers in Km, so don't expect to get your distance in miles w/o some math. So much for the false step sensor - it was off by about 2 percent.The radio picked up the stations that I preset pretty well. After about five minutes of use a VERY annoying ringing sound cuts in - so loud that the radio cannot be heard over it. I tried resetting it, replacing the battery, using different headphones, and finally smashing the unit. Guess which one solved my problem..."
5,AWESOME DBZ FIGURE!!!,This figure is amazing Ive searched all on amazon for an affordable articulated goku toy.This toy comes with two sets of hands open and fists.it also comes with a removable shirt.The only thing I dont like about this toy is that the hand cant bend up to do the kamehameha.
5,VH1 Storytellers - Sarah McLachlan,"I've been listening to Sarah McLachlan for years and I saw this on ""VH1"" when it originally aired. If you taped Sarah McLachlan on ""VH1 Storytellers"" when it originally aired like I did and are a devoted fan, this is a must have DVD.The feature performances are for ""Good Enough,"" ""Building a Mystery,"" ""Ice Cream,"" ""Sweet Surrender,"" ""Hold On,"" ""Elsewhere,"" ""Possession"" ""Witness"" and ""Angel."" The last two performances are bonuses which weren't on the original VH1 show. Sarah has a beautiful voice and very powerful words and this was truly an amazing DVD.I was moved by the passion and emotion and the meaning behind the lyrics. This DVD has terrific sound and features flawless live performances. In between songs Sarah talks about some of them and answers questions from the audience. The answers weren't as long as I hoped they'd be, but they did provide good insight into the music - and it is all about the music after all."
5,Warm and wonderful!,"I think this DVD is a must have for all the die hard Sarah fans, and an enjoyable addition to the collection of any one who has ever enjoyed her music. I think it is in the small venues such as this that she is most brilliant!"
3,potmerion strawberry tea cups,I have purchased this item from macy's in the past and the tea cups were the perfect size. We use them for cappuccino. I measured mine and they are 4 inches across. The ones I purchased from Amazon said they are also 4 inches across-they are not. They are substantially smaller-I am disappointed.
3,Needs adjustment but fixable,So for the $40 shipped this really is a great deal if you time isn't extremely valuable and you can adjust the saw. The insturctions include info on how to adjust the alignment of the saw and miter but nothing for the laser which for me was a full 1/8 off but it turns out that a cover snaps off and this too can be adjusted.Having an miter saw this inaccurate out of the box is sort of pointless so unless you plan on saving the $30 over the saw from the local hardware store by adjusting this saw to be accurate skip it.
2,"Inexpensive, but fragile...","I bought this as a ""second"" miter-saw. It is reasonably accurate (you *must* set it up and tighten it properly!), but due to the very inexpensive construction, it will flex if pressed.Compared to other, better made products that are close to the price (and when they're on sale, are about the same), it is not as good a deal. If something goes wrong with it, you have no easy service options.Think of it as very light-duty, potentially (and arbitrarily) disposable, and you won't be disappointed. You won't be thrilled, either, but you will get things done."
3,Very average... no confidence.,"I cannot depend on it to do professional jobs that require accuracy.Although it is usable for simple tasks. If you know your tasks, you can save money just buying this unit."
3,Great Product,"Although there are probably better miter saws in extistence, this product is a very useful tool to have in ones collection. With the right blades one could do all sorts of masonry tasks and interior borders. We have already used it for floor moldings and a mirror frame. I found a great deal on it at the time -> around50$ w/ship.Spring time: Cutting pavers"
2,NOT TOOOOOO BAD,I'VE WORKED WITH MANY SAWS IN MY LIFE. EVERYONE ALWAYS SAYS DEWALT. WELL I DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR THE DEWALT NAME. I BOUGHT THIS SAW FOR PRICE WITHOUT KNOWING HOW HUCH QUALITY WENT INTO IT. I RECEIVED IT QUICKLY TOOK IT OUT OF THE BOX AND GAVE IT A QUICK TEST DRIVE AND TO MY SUPPRISE THE SAW WAS ONLY OFF MAYBE1/4 DEGREE ON THE CROSSCUT AND 45 DEGREE CUT. NOTHING TOO WORRY ME TOO MUCH. IT CAN BE TWEEKED IN MOMENTS TO PEREFT WITHOUT MUCH TROUBLE. AS FAR AS IN THE LASER IT IS NOT AS CLEAR AS I WOULD LIKE IT TO BE BUT I WILL MESS WITH THAT ALSO. THE BLADE COULD BE UPGRADED ALSO. ALL AND ALL A REAL GOOD SAW FOR THE MONEY. SO DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON EXPENSIVE MITER SAWS THIS ONE IS JUST FINE
4,Nice for the Money,Performs as promised and has some great features. It however does have a draw back in that the arm wont extend to cut larger boards than the saw blade. The lazer eye is a nice feature.
4,Good for the price,"I bought sometime around 2006 as it was on sale (less than $60 if I remember correctly) and I needed a miter saw. For the price, it's a great unit, and would be good for building with 2x4's or doing trim work. Over all, this saw is okay, but I need to re-adjust the laser on it, as it's not aimed too well anymore. The motor seems to be strong and the chassis is light but sturdy.Unfortunately for me, I also tried to use this saw when building my deck and it's simply not big enough. If I bought another saw, I'd get a compound sliding miter saw, and it would be larger than 8-1/4""."
5,GMC compund mitre saw,Have been very happy with my purchase as i have been renovating my bathroom. I did the first part of the trim without it and was frustrated. I then received my Mitre saw and wizzed right thru the remainder with excellent results. The price was also something I could afford. thank you Amazon & GMC. HNLeete
5,Excellent Buy for the Price,"While I was a little unsure of the quality because of the low price, I was very surprised and it was more than I expected. I just got done painting the kitchen when it arrived. I did ceiling molding, baseboard molding, outside corner on two doorways and some chair rail. After just a few practice cuts, everything went very smooth - nice accurate cuts. The laser is a key feature."
3,It was okay,"Well, it's was alright. Seriously though, I did not get the thrill of knowing how it felt to be in the Holocaust. I couldn't feel the fear or how terrorizing it was... It could have been much more descriptive and more interesting. I am twelve, almost thirteen, but I have a very high maturity level from having precocious puberty, so I have a pretty high reading level.I'm just saying that the wording could have been better, more descriptive, and more in-depth of the real emotions people felt in the Holocaust. What they looked like after a while, more of how the wagon ride felt, what the gas chambers looked like, etc.So, overall I'm giving it a three. Truthfully, it's not a book I would ever read again or recommend to others."
1,the cage,This book is in terrible condition. I would not give much less sell in dirty and smelly condition. Plus inside cover filthy insulting language is written. Was supposed to be in GOOD condition. NOT SO!!!!Yes I did purchase through Amazon
1,this book is no good,"The Cage was written by Ruth Minsky Sender. It is horrible. The story was just like most books about the WWII involving jews. The book is not original in any way.It does make you feel sad. Sad that you have read it because it is a lousy book.If you want to read a good book about the Holocaust, you shoud read Night."
4,The Cage,"The Cage by Ruth Minsky Sender was a wonderful novel. It was about Riva, a young girl who's childhood was taken from the Nazis. It tells of her life in the ghettos of Lodz, Poland, and the concentration camps. Even though it was sad to read, it kept me interested and I couldn't put it down. The part that really touched me was when Riva's mother died and she became a mother to her brothers. This book makes you see more of the evils of the Holocaust and how it impacted the life of a young girl. It also shows how it turned Jewish people's lives around. After reading this book, I have learned that you should never take things for granted, like family or even sunshine, because people like Riva lost the people they loved and even their lives."
5,Beautiful...,"I have never really been interested in Holocaust books before. I would read about the victims of the Holocaust, but they would not seem real to me. Ruth Minsky Sender's, Cage, changed that. She brought a life to the story that is rare to find in any book and had me begging for the story to continue at the end.If you enjoy books filled with smiles, tears, family, and hope, then you should read this book. I would recommend it to anybody."
5,I loved it !,When I read this book I learned how violent and unforgiving world war two was. What saddens me even more is that it happened to thoudands of people and that it was unescapable to so many. This book showed me how strong love can be even in unexplanible situations.
4,The Cage,The beginning of The Cage was very interesting and kept me hooked. But after chapter 30 or so it was just dragging on about her finger being throbbing. All in all it was a fairly decent book.
5,incredibly emotional,"I loved this book, and I read it in one day. As soon as I got it I couldn't put it down. It shows how hard the holocaust was. If you liked this book than I recommend the book I Have Lived A Thousand Years, by Livia Bitton-Jackson"
5,"Great, very descriptive, emotional book.","I thought this book told how it was like to be in the Holocaust very well. When Riva lost her mom it was so heartbreaking. This is a must read book. I can't think of how to put it into words, it's that great."
4,An Excellent Start If You Are Reading About WW2,"I Read this book about two years ago and it left me many questions and very intrigued about the holocaust. Since then I have read many books on the subject such as: If I Should Die Before I Wake, Night, I Have lived A Thousand Years and many others.When I read this book(having no idea what WW2 was about)I was shocked at how jews were treated and the people who were helpinng them. How could people treat others that way. But some are evil and its insane how Hitler manipulated all of those people into thinking like that. This kind of treatment should not EVER happen agian and we all cannot forget the past or it will effect the future, and if something is to ever happen agian we all need to speak out.I would reccomend this book to anyone who, actually I think EVERYONE should read this book. Everyone needs to know about the horror of the holocaust.READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!"
4,the Cage,"This book was a very very good book I would recommend it i am only on chapter 18 but i have already found some grammar mistakes in the book. even though it has some mistakes in it, it's still a good book."
5,It Is A Great Book!!!,Ruth Sender knows how to write a great book! And this was a great example. She was extremely discriptive. I really enjoyed reading this book.
3,Cuts through tough madded hair!,"I have an Alaskan Malamute, and her hair is very thick. This blade is excellent for cutting through the massive amount of thick hair. But, I give it 3 stars, because it goes dull too quickly :( I'm guessing other ""big dog"" owners have experienced the same."
2,Blade cutting ability,I got this blade to cut the winter fur of a Pom and it was not able to do it. The dog hair gets matted and I thought this cutter would do it but it didn't.
1,The Cure need to sue this band.,"I'm a huge fan of dark-wave/goth/post-industrial/etc., so I'm not writing this out of unfamiliarity with the genre. This music is a sad rip-off of The Cure circa Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me, minus the sense of humor. On most of the songs, the guy is even imitating Robert's voice and guitars, and the worst part is the lyrics are all cut and pasted from various Cure songs- whole phrases are plagiarized!I will say the cover version of Time After Time is genius and you should by the MP3.Otherwise, this band isn't even derivative- they are thieves, and should be sued for copyright violations."
4,One of the better spoofs and grossly underated,I have been looking for this Film to be shown on TV for some many years. I remember it as one of the best of the genre. Watch for the Highwaymen's 'Sundial' Sketch. Well worth a look.SQ
5,Unforgettable Classic,"Saw this film some 8 years ago, still able to recite the moneylender scene, but growing weaker as time goes by. With a ""hint"" of Python to it, this appeals to all Python lovers. One of the all time classic comedies, need to brush up on the memorising of the script, and sing a long with the rowing song. An absolute must.Any copies out there."
4,A fair introduction to Deleuze's independent works,"I had a much different reaction to Brusseau's text than the previous reviewer did. Brusseau's text provides an excellent introduction to the works of middle Deleuze such as _The Logic of Sense_ and _Difference and Repetition_. While most Deleuze scholarship tends to place its emphasis on _A Thousand Plateaus_, Brusseau instead opts to develop Deleuze's account of events and apply them to various literary texts. The result of this analysis is a clear, albeit problematic, articulation of Deleuze's account of incorporeal transformations as they effectuate themselves upon bodies and create new possibilities for living and acting. For anyone interested in the Deleuze of _The Logic of Sense_-- A key text for comprehending what's going on in ""Postulates of Linguistics"" along with their use of Hjelmslevian content and expression in ATP --and the role that Nietzsche's eternal return plays in Deleuze's thought, Brusseau's text is a must read."
2,Line-out is horrible,"This product works ok as a charger, but the line-out jack adds tons of static. I thought it was a problem with my car until I tried a Monster charger. The Monster charger adds no distortion and its line-out sounds great."
3,Does NOT work with iPhone 3G,Unfortunately this does not work with the iPhone 3G. An earlier review states that it does but perhaps a firmware update has changed this. I have tried this charger with both my wife's and my own charger and it puts a message on the screen that the charger is not compatible with the phone. The audio out works fine but it will ask if you want to put the phone into airplane mode. I would not recommend this for use with an IPhone 3G.
1,Dead out of the Box,"This item arrive in good condition, but out of the box it failed to work in my car.Belkin wouldn't handle replacing it, and I ended up just tossing the item rather than going through the hassle of refunding through Amazon. Belkin makes a lot of iPod accessories, and it's clear that they spend more on packaging than the products. Finally, I have to ask why Belkin insists on the blister packaging they use? I know it helps reduce theft in stores, but couldn't they use a different packaging for Amazon and other major online retailers, so that returns aren't an ordeal?"
1,Rip Off,"The product description is really misleading. Disc One is the ""Masters from the Vault:Focus"" (by far the best of the three discs). Disc Two is the ""Focus:Live in America"" with the current lineup from 2003(I doubt anyone would watch this disc twice). And the final disc is basically some of the performances from the documentary on Disc One.Contrary to the product description THERE IS NO FOOTAGE from the Rainbow Concert and the 1971 Belgian TV special IS NOT shown in its entirety, just the outtakes in the documentary.The only thing new on here is a performance of Philip Catherine's ""Sneezing Bull"" (and that as well as Catherine's ""Angel Wings"" are misattributed to Thys Van Leer).If you already have the documentary on disc one there is really nothing new or worthwhile here."
1,There He Goes Again....,"This is utter trash. Epstein lives on a remote cloud; and from there he pontificates on matters he simply does not understand. This drivel seems harmless, but conservative policy-makers (who else?) are more than occasionally taken in by him with disastrous results in places such as NAFTA and local governments in Oregon. Since Stiglitz et al have shown (Nobel Prize, 2001) that neither the ""free enterprise system"" nor the ""invisible hand"" really exist, Epstein can tell us about as much about economics as religious zealots can teach us about evolution."
2,these hurt!,I wore these to workout in with my PF pain and boy did it make my feet hurt - felt like a toothache throbbing pain! OMG! I couldn't wait to take them off.
1,Terrible,"Very bad product. It hurts your foot after 10 minutes of wearing it, which makes it pointless to buy. save your money"
5,gives the support you need,The bandage gave me the arch support I needed and works as advertised. Just remember to buy 2 because it only comes with 1.
2,Too tight,"This item was impossibly small! Despite being ""elastic"" it barely was....I called the company and was treated respectfully by a rep who said that my money would be refunded."
1,No Support,This bandage is too big for my 8 1/2 size foot! It feels good when I pull on the top to put more pressure on my arch but it's unrealistic to do that all day. I do a better job taping up my foot with surgical tape than what this does.
3,Too Tight For Me,"Just a little too tight for me, but another family member was able to use it...There's always an answer, even when it is to return something. So no worries mate."
2,One size does not fit all!,"My feet are size 7 1/2 B (medium width ) The Pedi Fix Arch Bandage was too wide and slipped down to the ball of my foot and would not even stay in place.I am going to try one that is adjustable like the Mueller, or one that comes in sizes (Foot smart, Pro Tec) all sold through Amazon. I really need to try something for my aching arches. Never got the chance with this one."
2,Didn't work how I hoped.,They compressed my feet too much. I ended up being in more pain from the bandage than it relieving it.
3,They are OKuntil they stretch,"Others have said this besides me. I, however am considering sewing some memory foam in cloth on the underside to create a cushion under my arch now that some have stretched."
3,Not super supportive,"I have had products like this in the past that were very supportive and helped with arch pain a lot. These seemed to not be elastic enough, they got stretched out and slipped on my foot."
3,Helps!!,It helps a little -- but it could be just the particular bandage I rec'd.The package insert indicates to place the seam on the bottom of your foot. Double check the seam!! The bandage I rec'd has a tiny sharp corner of the seam. It was very irritating. I covered it with a piece of adhesive felt/moleskin.
2,too tight ergo too painful,I'm thinking my foots blue color is due to the fact that no blood can flow through.Otherwise it is fine
2,Not for what intended,"I would wanted to know there was only one item, for 1 of the feet in the package. It doesn't can be used instead of solid orthopodics arch."
1,Doesn't stand up to expectations.,I bought this product because I am having trouble with falling arches. The product was a big disappointment.
2,Still Hurtin',"I haven't had the same results as previous reviewers. The compression feels nice and all, but hasn't really alleviated my fascitis, which is localized from the front inside of my heel and up the arch a little. If you wear these to sleep you will probably wake up in pain and take them off."
2,Did not work for me.,"I can't agree with the positive feedbacks here since this item didn't work for me as I though was going to do so,. instead it gave me more pain in my foot than without it. My foot got red and painful I had to take them off in the middle of the street because my feet were burning and sore. When I took them off I felt much better.. It did not work for me perhaps because I have flat feet and need something more sophisticated. I gave it 2 stars because they did returned my money with a decent check. Good luck to other users."
3,"Helpful, But Not a Cure.","I've noticed a difference when wearing it and not. It IS helpful + it's only 4 bucks. Doesn't cure the problem, but it helps."
2,its not adjustable,"If you have a wide foot like me, so it may not work for you as it run too tight on your foot. I have a flat arch, so I though this bandage may be helpful to reduce my heel pain. Before I bought this bandage, I thought it can be adjustable."
2,only ok,"this bandage might work, but it keeps sliding down my foot away from where I need it to stay. If I wear it over my socks, it does stay much better, but then you see it."
1,Horrible DO NOT BUY.,"Does nothing more than cut off my circulation. Do not buy this product, is does not help at all! You're better off wearing a rubber band around your foot."
2,Too big,"I have a relatively narrow foot so this was too big and did nothing for me. All it is, is a piece of elastic bandage."
1,Ugly,"Looked okay online - maybe that was because I was excited they were pretty cheap. If you buy these & actually wear them, you will look retarded. I am no fashion snob, but for Gods' sake these things just do not look right."
3,Collar gets REALLY crumpled even in a gentle wash/dry cycle,I bought two of these shirts and have had them for about 3 months now. The biggest problem is the collar gets really crumpled even after a gentle/delicate wash/dry cycle. I will not buy this shirt again. I wouldn't mind paying a little more if the manufacturer puts in a better collar that holds its shape. I have another Blake & Hollister shirt bought at about the same time (a minitex I believe) that doesn't suffer from this collar deformation issue.
4,bang for the buck,its a nice shirt for the price. Only bad thing is shirt does not soak up your sweat. It keeps your sweat between your body and the shirt. The reason I buy these shirt is because they make great cheap gifts.
4,Pretty good,"Not bad for price, quality, and look of item. I would recommend to many just because you can't beat that price. The quality to me by touch and look was very good for the price. Overall, good purchase for me."
5,Very Good,These were great quality shirts! Just make sure you look carefully at the color scheme before buying!
4,WOW 3 Barrymore Siblings together in 1 film,"The title says it all. WOW, 3 Barrymore sibblings together in one film. Amazing!Back in the day the Barrymore's were considered Hollywood royalty. They could do no wrong. They were all strong leading actors/sctress' and powerful infront of the camera. Well put all 3 of them together and you have an amazing adventure....For the history buffs out there, this fim is a must see. I thoroughly enjoyed the story and the characters created in this story."
5,PSP Comfort Grips,"Can't beat this product....a protective snap on case, grips for longer play time and a stand to watch your PSP movies. I've searched game stores for such a product and nothing comes close to the PSP Comfort Grips. It was a little hard to plug in my earphones or turn on the power but I got use to it. Since using the case I noticed my hands doesn't get as fatigued and with the added bulk the PSP isn't as ""Portable"" as I want it to be but hey, a small inconvenience for such an outstanding product."
2,not a good fit for slim models,"none of the buttons fit right and case is very loose. and metal holder to make it upright don't hold and always falls over. great idea, bad craftmanship..."
4,Comfort Grips is right,"There is an issues. It was not made for the slim. It does not fit snugly, the analog and buttons are slightly off, and difficult to turn the PSP on and off. With that said this is still an great grip. The stand was an unexpected treat. A drill bit for the headphone jack and all set. Glad i got this."
2,Doesn't Fit,i have the slim psp and this doesn't even come close to fitting i can't use it to play so i just use it as a protective case when my psp is not in use
4,made for original psp released,It works as described but my only complaint is that this was made for the bigger PSP(first one released in 2005) and is a little loose in my slim psp. I believe the seller should note that in the description. Either way it works and it is comfortable and i do not regret the buy.
5,A must read to understand color blind racism,"This book is great. Although life today can seem more like ""racism with racists,"" every radical or progressive should read this. The book takes on US racism and colorism by studying whites through sociology. I read this on the heels of ""The New Jim Crow,"" which I also recommend highly, and the books complement each other nicely."
1,nonsense nonscience,"I read this book several years ago but the conclusions reached in this book are ludicrous. Whenever a book concludes that one group of people is inherently better or worse than another group the burden of proof is much higher than flimsy methodology of the studies used in this book.For example asking people ""how many times in the last month have you had dinner with a person of color"" doesn't mean anything unless you also ask and include ""how many times in the last month have you had dinner with others"".Such obviously flawed methodology drives me bonkers, especially with the far reaching claims of this book. Which is a shame because there are some valid points and interesting ideas behind the book. It's really unfortunate that the author bases his arguments on the flawed idea that oppressed people can not also be racist, and hence the author himself isn't a racists."
5,If open to understanding the minority perspective,"This book may annoy, irritate, and even infuriate some, but if any of these emotions arise, you might ask yourself ""why do I feel so defensive?""...and I promise, you will gather a bit of enlightment. The book portrays the perspective of minority peoples in a way that will open your eyes. It IS one-sided, but not because the author is a ""racist"", rather, he feels (it's in his Author's Note) that enough books are written ABOUT minorities from a ""white perspective"" view of the world, so he thought he would write a book that showed a distinct minority perspective on ""white"" culture. It is not meant to arise aggression, it is written to give realizations and enhance communications between the races."
1,ridiculous book full of inane drivel,"This book was horrible. the characters are absurd and poorly developed and I was completely lost in what would seem like a fairly simple plot of black mail. Then the inane dialog leaves me only more confused. I feel like they only printed every other page of the manuscript from the way the story jumped around and the way the characters' actions had no apparent logic. The character development also was severly lacking. The author takes the time to describe the four ""sweethearts"" roles in their circle of friends and their troubled family lives, which has no apparent connection to their relationships or their current neroses. The couple of flynn (another bizare and random character) and tess was as unbelievable and unsympathetic when they were teenagers as it is now as adults."
5,More fun for him than I expected,"I will be honest - I bought this on a whim. I really didn't know how he would like it. He has found more ways to play with this toy than I could have imagined! The obvious way to play with this is to take the pieces off the pegs or dump them over and make a lot of fun noise. He also likes to put them back in various ways - testing different pegs with different pieces, he likes to clack them together, spin them around on the pegs, turn the board upside down and use it as a drum by hitting the various pieces on it, he tries to stack the wooden pieces on the floor and knock them down. He likes it when I stack them like house of cards - on their ends - and make a tall tower. The pieces are small enough that they are easily manipulated but not so small that I worry about them. Very engaging and quite a surprise!"
5,Plan Toys Sorter,"This geometric sorter is an excellent toy! One of the most wonderful things about this toy is that it is open-ended toy. My son plays with it daily; he likes to stack the pieces on the board or he'll take the pieces and play fill & spill with an empty container. When we first got the toy for him when he was 14 months old, he had trouble placing the pieces in the correct spot but now after a couple of months his sorting skills have improved greatly. This sorter is a great visual for introducing basic math skills, shapes and colors. The rubber wood used by Plan Toys is very smooth and has yet to splinter or crack (my son has thrown the pieces on tile floor many times with no damage). Some of the paint has transferred off onto some of the other pieces (mainly the blue, red, and green to the yellow) but not onto other surfaces. This toy is a great purchase; well made, durable and eco-friendly!"
4,Solid fun,"I bought this for my 18-month old daughter for Christmas and she really enjoyed it from the start. She picked up on how to fit the circle shapes right away, and is still working on the others, but even putting the shapes in willy-nilly is fun for her.The only downside is that storage is tricky - the pieces can fall away from the board and get lost easily. It seems like the designers could have fashioned some sort of rubber-band or even a lid that would hold things in place."
4,shapes,"my son loves shapes so i thought he would love this. he doesn't play with it as much as i thought but he is very obsessed with cars, so i understand. this is a cute little toy, bright colors and sturdy. he loves trying to get the shapes on the right skewers and with these shapes i was able to teach him his colors!"
2,defective?,"One star for awesome idea and another star for really nice bright colors... The problem was, as soon as we took it out of the box, all of the circles fell onto the floor. Why? Because the peg had snapped off. All of the other toys we got with our order were fine, so I'm thinking it wasn't the packaging or delivery that broke it."
4,fun fun fun,my kids love this. they enjoy it very much. play with it every day. why not check it out. your kids will like it
3,"Nice, non-toxic product - not made in China - but with a loose peg","Two stars were deducted because one of the pegs fell out which required a re-gluing. Otherwise, this product, like all other Plan Toys' products, uses replenishable rubber tree wood and vegetable dyes for coloring, and is smooth and well-machined -- good for the little one who sticks everything in her mouth. On the same token, the loose peg was small enough to pose a serious choking hazard and I always make a habit of regularly inspecting this toy -- something I should do with all toys anyway."
3,Not suitable for a 2 year old,"I bought this for my 2 year who loves puzzles, but he became so frustrated. I think it was the pegs that made him frustrated each time he tried to place the pieces back onto the board. I feel it's meant for a kid closer to the age of 3. Counting the pegs and holes will definitely help."
4,A Great Legend Lives Again,"The ""Anthology by Roy Orbison"" is a ""must-have"" for those who cherish the beauty this great talent gave to the art of ballad. The video features interviews of those who knew him which adds dimension to this enigmatic giant of a past era. Several songs were played that I have never heard in over 30 years of enjoying Mr. Orbison's music. The video truly presents the intensity, talent, beauty, and charismatic intensity of Roy Orbison's singing and brilliance as a song writer. I rated the video four star instead of five only because of the below average quality of some of the video/audio segments. Other than some quality problems which were the result of the recording at the time the videos were made, this video is a classic. Those who love Roy Orbison will want this video."
1,Performances spoiled by inane commentators,"This DVD is very disappointing. Whoever edited this DVD is not a music lover. Roy's performances are interrupted and spoiled by the gushing comments of the Bee Gees, Robert Plant, k d lang, etc. It's not a DVD that one can play often for enjoyment because one does not want to hear the comments of the other performers more than once. The Roy Orbison's Black & White concert DVD is vastly superior."
4,An excellent collection of Roy's best songs,"The 50 minute dvd contains 13 of Roy's big songs, most filmed when they were made famous 40 years ago. Audio and video quality has been cleaned up somewhat on the dvd, but is not of today's standards. Interesting introductions and commentary by many famous singers and songwriters make the presentation a very good one. Highly recommended."
3,Adequate device,I still like the Apple version better but for the price this is a nice product. I use it as an extra charger so I don't have to keep moving my original one around.
3,What Happened to Klaus Schultze?,"This album seems to be where KS changed. The tunes on previous albums were long and changed slowly over their long lengths. At this point he has started to use electronic drums, which is fine, except the beats remain static and he chooses one or two sounds to improvise with over the backdrop he creates. Unfortunately it can get monotonous. At the time I'm sure it was different but now it is somewhat lifeless. The earlier albums featuring analog equipment are similar and also tax your patience with their length and subtlety but sonically it was more pleasing to my ears. Mr S began to use live drums in some of his recordings but when the electronic drums began to permeate it got a little dull. Same thing happened to Jean-Michel Jarre after Magnetic Fields. I can't generate the same enthusiasm for the post-digital Schultze as for the acknowledged classic albums such as Timewind, Moondawn and Mirage."
3,Not a Sunny Cocktail Ring,"Obviously, this is a cat scratching post. As cat vertical scratching posts go, this is a little short. My adult cats cannot reach up and stretch on this post. It is kitten-sized.Otherwise, seems to be built well and fairly sturdy with good materials."
4,What a great voice,"I have never seen Howard perform and this is exactly how I imagined a solo performance from him. His voice sounds as good as it ever has. If you are a Shalamar fan or just want some smooth vocals, check this out. Howard needs to lose the hat though. If you got a little baldness going on, let it show."
3,Howard,"One of my favorite artists, i just exspected a little more from him. It was just a little too somber for me. Afraid i gave this one away."
3,ALL IN THE FAMILY,"BLOOD RELATIONS plays like as twisted episode of TWILIGHT ZONE or NIGHT GALLERY, with Jan Rubes doing a pretty good Vincent Price imitation in his role as the rather demented doctor who has dire plans for his wayward son's new fiancee...just as he and she have similar plans for him..or do they? Lydie Denier is a pretty good femme fatale and Kevin Hicks, looking a little like a young blonde Mel Gibson, is a studly partner. The movie's writer Steven Saylor also joins in the murderous merriment as a crooked lawyer. It's all been done before and there aren't really any surprises, but it's demented humor saves it from being a total washout."
5,good,This was a good item. I looked a while for these for a science project for my daughter. Just what I needed
5,Amazing,This was amazing and is lasting a long time. The recording is excellent as well and the product arrived on time!
3,"Not a lot to it, but what do you expect for the price?","The guide has a minimum of information on petroglyphs, and I'm not sure that there is much here that will really be useful in the field. It contains more of an overview of what petroglyphs are, and a VERY sketchy view of different categories (different cultures, different methods of making petroglyphs, etc.). I kept being reminded of something I might have been given as a handout in elementary school.I have two criticisms, one is that I don't really see much information here that will be useful in the field. The other is that the guide is printed on medium-quality paper, and with no plasticizing or water-proofing at all. It will quickly disintegrate when taken into the field, unless you take strong measures to protect it from moisture, dirt, and rough handling. I just don't see much use for it, even at this very low price."
2,good for young kids.,"This little field guide is very basic. It it good for kids, but if you want a detailed understanding of what you're looking at in the field, I would not recommend this one."
3,Quick and clever party cakes,"This is a fun book. It is well done and easy to use. I always enjoy the fun Lindy Smith puts into her creations. Excellent for a beginner and fun for the advanced. There is such a bit of whimsy about her things, you always smile when making a cake with her ideas. These cakes can be made and done wihout having to tie up your kitchen and table for days on end, too. The Ballet Star cake is sure to please any girl up to about 12 or so and the Catapiller Cake is my favorite. He is adorable and she uses real cabbage leaves to impress the fondant on the cake board so it seems real. There's a purse for the more sophiticated. The down side of these cakes is their size. You would really have to put most of these cakes onto bigger cakes in order to fed all but the smallest group, but that is certainly doable."
5,"this album is absolute gold.... and if there's something better, its that","I downloaded the album and I was absolutely blown away. he music is aliv. The sheer radience of layerd overtones overwhelms the senses yet simultaneously nourishes them leading to a complete state of oneness with self that I can't even begin to describebasically, buy this album, its completely worth it"
5,Music of the Gods.,"I had purchased this MP3 a couple of months ago. It got lost in my music files and wasn't listened to, until today. Absolutely Beautiful Music! I can't stop listening to it. The samples don't do it justice. If you want some music to listen to that will take you away from it all, This is it!"
1,Economy Burner Covers,These arrived badly damaged. I was leary on buying them to begin with because of another customer's review about theirs' being damaged. I am still waiting for a refund. I recommend that you don't buy.
2,Apple jack burner covers,The picture on the covers was beautiful but there were little dents in the covers everywhere. I not sure if it was poor packaging or poor storing in the warehouse. Not very happy!!
4,Todo Bien,"Muy buena la calidad del edredon, lo recomiendo, lo único malo es que no viene con las fundas de la almoada."
3,Poor Quality,"The comforter is not as good at it looks online. The material is not what I expected. For the price I pay, i don't think it's a good investment."
4,Exactly what I was expecting,"This is exactly as it looks on the picture. As other reviews had mentioned that the white was more of a grey, this is true and is highlighted when using a snow white bed skirt but there are other areas of white that get highlighted by a white bedskirt in the middle of the comforter. My 4 year old absolutely loves this and it looks great in her room. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE WALL STICKERS THAT MATCH. They really set off the comforter!"
5,My daughter loves it!!!,This item is so pretty and warm!! My daughter loves it. I would recommend it for any little girl.
3,Dramatic,"Though new to lieders and Quasthoff, I find myself thinking of these songs while at work. The lieders that play in my mind throughout the day are Brahms' Lieder und Gesange, op. 32. Specifically, ""Bitteres zu sagen denkst du"" as well as, ""Wie bist du, meine Konigin"". Justus Zeyen's piano lends beautifully to the haunting quality of Quasthoff's amazing voice. He makes me wonder if this is how angels might sound. For me, these two songs alone, are worth the price of admission."
5,Funk Perfection,"This was my first exposure to the Dirty Dozen Brass Band, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to hear them. Their sound is a sort of perfectly realized funk: Fun tunes, energetic arrangements, and spirited solos. References to the rich musical traditions of New Orleans are ever present and give the music a richness and a sense of history, but this band always sounds fresh and alive. I'll bet their live performances are something special.Since I wear my Ipod when I run and work out, I need snappy tunes that hold my interest - my current playlist uses more songs from this CD than any other in my collection - I think that's a good measure of the fun you will have with it!"
2,What?,"This movie is a complete wast of money, even for the true MMA fan. Most of the fights are horrendously boring ground and pound fights that go to a decision. There is absolutely no fight in here that was a real good matchup. especially the main event. Royler just gets completely dismantled by Sakuraba. It is a really boring fight. Royler just sits on the grond and Sakuraba continuously kicks him in the leg. And don't think im giving this DVD such a bad review because im not a true MMA fan. I practice judo and ju jitsu three times a week so i have great appreciation for the ground game, but this DVD is horrible. Please do youselves a favour and save your money, don't by PRIDE 8."
5,My 3-year-old loves it!,I bought this pillowcase as an incentive for my 3-year-old to sleep in her big girl bed. She loves it and has yet to get out of bed before 7:30 each morning!
4,very nice,I purchased this mattress pad to cover the mattress that I bought from the same company. The mattress pad fits and looks nice.
2,cradle mattress,"the picture shows a rectangular mattress, with squared off corners. What I received was rounded corners, so there is too much space in the cradle. Not wanting to put in bumper pads, we were not really happy with the product. The quality was fine as far as the cover being waterproof."
4,Sanoxy usb changer,"Even though the item was received before the expected due date, I had higher expectations of its arrival date comparing it to the other items I had received."
5,as advertised,"thank you for my gender changer. Funny name but I thoroughly understand!! Good price, quick delivery. It is always good to have extra parts/adapters/cables on hand. Thank you again."
4,Good Product,Works as I expected. Allows me to change gender and connect two different male USB devices as was attemptimg to accommplish.
1,took to long,This item does not ship from this country. It took a month to get a 5.00 dollar item. It is shipped as far away as you can get. China. They should tell you this before you order not after
5,item arrived on time and quality is fine,"i received this item on time and the quality is fine...this was a hard connection to find, and i found it here..thanks for putting a end to my search.."
2,Well at least one worked,"I needed a gender changer to extend the USB port in my vehicle, so for sixty cents and free shipping I couldn't go wrong ordering two units. After an extended shipping time (from Hong Kong), I tried the unit out and it was defective. Lucky for me I ordered two and the second one worked, so much for a backup."
5,Exactly as expected,Great product and price. Works exactly as you would expect. I got this because I accidentally bought a male-to-male usb extension. This works to make it a normal usb extension.
4,No Problems and Great Price,"I've been using this thing for a month and I can't complain. I'm just using it as part of an ""extension cord"" along with a ""type A to type A"" USB cable that I got at the dollar store.The price was nice and I didn't need it in a rush, so I didn't mind the wait. I actually got it before the date it was promised."
3,Ok,"The price was right. It cost more to ship it then it cost to buy the gender changer, but it was what I needed."
5,Just what I needed,I refilled all the adapters that I lost over time with these and they fit the bill. Just what I needed.
2,D+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++,I thought I would need this for a camera to my printer then I got a new printer last week so I want to return it for a full refund
5,Tested on PC,I bought this so I could play around with a mouse and keyboard on my Nook Color and have not tried it yet but when I got this I did test it on my computer to make sure it worked with that at least and have no complaints the cords fit into the adapter nice and it works.
5,USB ADAPTER,The prduct was exactly what I needed and what I expected. It provided the connection needed. The ompany also provided good support when I had questions regarding my purchase.
4,usb gender changer,I wanted to use this product to ube with my android tablet . This item worked as expecter and I would reccomend it .
3,Bought for keyboard,"Bought it to hook up to the keyboard, which would hook up to a reducer, which should hook up to the Cruz Tablet, but, it didn't. I was a waste of money for that purpose. I maybe able to use it to connect two USB cables together."
3,Not an OTG cable!,"Tried to use this in conjunction with a micro usb cable so that I could use my phone as a host instead of a client. It didn't work! There is such a thing as a micro AB connector, which is different from a standard micro B connector, so with my typical USB-A to Micro-B cable, this coupler did not suit my needs, and I have yet to find a use for it. Regardless, it probably works for something! If you intend to use this to connect usb devices to your phone though, be warned that you (probably) need a special micro usb cable with type AB ending. In any case, it didn't work with my typical micro usb cable..."
2,Delivered Items Do Not Work!,"From past reviews of other buyers, I noticed some of these adapters delivered have a high rate of problems. The price was low, so I ordered two of the same item, hoping that one out of two will do the job for me. Both adapters do not work( dead on arrival). Then I went to a big electronic store in my neighborhood and bought a similar item for a much higher price. It was also not working. All these tiny electronic parts were manufactured in Asia, probably from the same factory. I suspect the factory did not do much quality check on their products. My purchase prices were fully refunded after contacting the seller."
2,Didn't work,"I couldn't use it as an adapter when connecting USB to USB to Micro connectors. I'm not sure if this is the correct usage but it would seem that it should connect all cables. However, I elected not to return because it would cost me more in shipping than what the adapter cost me. It was worth the price to give it a try."
5,yep,it works like it supposed to if that's what you are looking for I totally recommend it. if it's not then don't buy it.
4,It does what it says it does,"Nothing much to say, functions the way it should. The only thing is color seems to be a gamble, I thought They were white but the ones I got were yellow."
3,"its functional but not all that solid feeling, but decent for the pricce","not bad for the price but it could be made a bit more solidly perhaps some more plastic around the ends to make it heavier and more substantial, but it works ok and it was reasonably priced"
1,Doesn't work,I had hoped that it would connect my phone to a memory card reader but it didn't work. I also tried it with other things. It didn't do it for me.
1,It's a useless product for me,"I tried to connect my mice several times with my computer and DVR, but no luck at all. Apparently, this is not what I thought product. It wasted my time, money, and energy."
4,A good replacement unit,"Housing wasn't an exact fit for my furnace, so I had to cut some of the sheet metal housing in order to make it fit. It didn't come with a flapper valve to prevent cold air drainage when furnace isn't on, and I wasn't able to remove the valve from the old fan unit. But it works fine and arrived on time as promised."
1,"Hunting for the ""Right"" in Hunting.","This book IS very easy to read, a neccessary feature for most hunters. It shows the ongoing desperate search to justify this cruel and increasingly unpopular activity. The government coddled minority of hunters will find no new excuses for their obsessive, cowardly enjoyment in killling."
1,The truth of the matter,"The only problem about this cd is Marlin Ramazzini's voice, which often comes across as thin, nasal, and just a bit off-pitch. She's a dynamic performer, though, and her infectious attitude compesates for some fairly grating moments.It's hard to say if she was overwhelmed by her backing band or if she just isn't comfortable in the studio. Either way, the next record will have to be more carefully tailored to her strengths."
2,Disappointing to a person who has seen a live Andy Williams Christmas show,Disappointing show from a person we admire. My family enjoys Andy Williams and his shows. I was surprised when this particular show form Branson did not appeal to us.
3,The Andy Williams Christmas Show (Live from Branson),An enjoyable concert by Andy in his later years. The concert provides a good view of his theatre in Branson.
2,christmas show,it wasn't what i thought it would be. I thought it was the tv special but it is a live performance.
5,It ain't Xmas until Andy Williams sings,"I love Xmas and I love Andy's Xmas specials - it does seem that you can't have one without the other. His shows are professionally done, but folksy and boy next door at the same time. No matter how old he gets, he will always be the same age to me. Certainly there are other singers who sing better, but nobody matches Andy for charm and sincerity. This is a real feel-good DVD. You can't avoid smiling and being transported back to a kinder gentler time through Andy's magic. The rest of the world may go insane, but as long as there is Andy Williams, it is possible to believe in goodness, magic, love, and Xmas."
2,Andy Williams,This was a boring show! Andy Williams was great. The female singer who was with him was not!
5,Disney's Sketchbooks - Great Resource for Artists!,"This fine addition to the Disney Sketchbook series has many of the wonderful sketches done by Disney's animation department for The Little Mermaid, including many pieces from the storyboards, and several sketches of scenes that never made it into the final film.Artists that would like to study the Disney style of drawing and animation should find this volume a terrific addition to their collection despite its rather high price. As a student of art, and a fan of the Disney style, I highly recommend any of these books for your library."
2,mean guns was the best,I only brought this set because i wanted mean guns and it was cheaper than buying it on its own. Mean guns was good but not as good as i remember it.The other movies really aren't worth mentioning.
2,Not too bad,"Not a bad read. The authors write quite well. Based on some of the comments made by the Muslim readers, there seems to be doubt as to whether it is factually accurate in portraying Islam. Which is a shame as it could have been better."
1,Why did I bother?,"If you want to learn something about Islam, then read a book by a Muslim. You wouldn't learn much about Christianity, by reading a theology book by a Muslim now would you?"
1,UNADULTERATED BIGOTRY,"The book is unadulterated bigotry under the guise of research. Once cannot and should not condemn 1.3 Billion Peoples with the judgemental view of Dr. Geisler. Jesus would be appalled at this book.Dr. Geisler has said nothing new in his book. All of this has already been given to us for over 1400 years.Dr. Geisler should be building bridges with the monotheistic faiths, Catholicism and Judaism and also others. His strategy of confronting Islam with a vengence creates no new friendsChidlren of Abraham (COA): American Jewsihm Muslim Alliance (AJMA)-American Christian Muslim Alliance (ACMA)New Jersey"
2,Not based on fact and logic,I read The Bible The Koran and Science by Maurice Bucaille and it made a lot of sense. The facts in the book are presented very well. I read this book and it seems to me that the author is trying to find a way to discredit the findings of Dr. Bucaille. This book does not hold well together logically. After reading Dr. Bucaille's book I studied Islam and everything he said in his book about the Koran is true. This book on the other hand tries to make an agrument where there is none
1,Not terribly informative,"If you want to read a good book about Islamic faith and piety, look to a more fair and scholarly account of Islam and Islamic history, like Annemarie Schimmel's ""Islam"" or Marshall Hodgson's three volume work ""The Venture of Islam."" While this book pretends to be fair, you'd be better off reading more respected and objective books about Islam and the Islamic civilization."
1,This book will only convice those that are already convined.,"I am saddened to see people who are unfamiliar with Islam and its teachings so eager to embrace a book which only builds on that ignorance. Many non-Muslim scholars have read the Qur'an and commented on it and recognized its amazing nature. They don't twist verses to fit an interpretation they know is in error. The Qur'an and its miraculous nature have been recognized by Muslims and Non-Muslims. I recommend to those readers genuinely interested in learning about the Qur'an and its validity to read Bucaille's book ""The Qur'an, the Bible, and Science."""
1,lacks objectivity & truth,"The work of Mishaal ibn Abdullah, anopponent, defaced the credibility of this book by rebutting it 'point-by-point'. Only then did I realize the seriousness of the misrepresentation involved in this one. If you're looking to debate with muslims, this is NOT a book you'd want to prepare with! Matthew 15:11"
1,Prejudicial rubbish,"As the Beatles would say ""C'mon Baby, Twist and Shout""The authors of this book do whatever they can to twist and manipulate the Bible and Quran to make their views."
1,Nothing New!!,"I read this book before converting to Islam. Now I am more convinced that Islam is the last message of God after the distortion of the holly books of Judaism and Christianity through the centuries. This book does not add anything new to discuss. It lacks seriousness as it is supported by very weak arguments. The authors alone, and maybe their close friends, might give credit for this book, and nobody else. If you like to read a book that critisize Islam for the sake of envy and zealotry, you may get this book."
1,Orientalism At Its Most Shameless,"This book serves as a fine example of the age-old orientalist attempt at discrediting an eastern religion. Though the introductory chapters dilineating the very basics of Islam are accurate, the authors completely shatter their credibility in the chapters that follow by displaying a gross misunderstanding of Islamic theology as well as establishing their poor scholarship. Any individual who has so much as the most minute of civil relations with a traditional Muslim will attest to the fact that this book is clearly geared towards the ignorance of the West. As somebody who has lived in the Middle East amongst the Muslim people, I would assert that the intentions of this book are to indoctrinate the lay person with distortions and untruths about one of the world's most important religions. Geisler and Abdul Saleeb belong in the same class as Johnny Cochrane and our beloved President."
4,"Easy to understand, the most often used resources.","Christians have used this resource to gain a basic understanding of Islam, probably more than any other. There's a reason why - it is very simply a great read that is easy to understand. This book covers the basics, and gives just a tad of history. If you want to gain a basic understanding of Islam from the Christian perspecitve, then this is the book to buy. Many Muslims, after reading Abdul Saleeb's testimony, have even made the transition to Christianity because of this book."
5,Spot-On Response to claims based ignorance,"Answering Islam does not pretend to be a text book on Islam. It is, however, a reply to the claims and charges typically made against and on Christianity by Islam, as its title suggests. In that department, we from the muslim far-east feel that this Book is great, par-excellance! Both Geisler and Abdul Saleeb have simply exercised their ""right of reply"" to answer the typical muslim claims against Christianity and the Gospel, much of which have no basis in fact whatsoever or have them in sheer ignorance in the face of the facts. Abdul Saleeb, being a former muslim does provide valid and valuable insights into his former religion-Islam. Both writers deserve a round of applause for exercising the right to reply and answer, and this Book itself deserves More than five Gold stars for addressing the Topic in such a lucid and eye-opening way. Yet this will be evident only to those who read it with an open mind."
1,Medieval Thoughts Remain in the Era of Knowledge,"Same accusations toward Islam have been launched by some orientalists during ""Crusaders' wars"" and now their works are considered irrelevant worldwide. The writers must revise first, the Second Vatican Council's recommendations toward Islam (1965) to peel their zealous illusions, and second, the yearly Jesus Seminar's researches (held by more than 200 bible scholars and scientists) to be acquainted with the last findings about Christianity. Finally, both objectivity and real contributions are imparative for a thesis to be valuable. Unfortunately, this book is prejudice and offers nothing new."
1,Shame,It is certainly not serious what it is given in this book. Do we still have such ignorance at the end of the 20st century? This makes me laugh and laugh and laugh. It reminds me of some fictional comics that I read when a cat or a dog could be transformed magically to a human being or a bird. The arguments of this book have the same logic! It is just a waist...
1,Inconsistent,"Nearly all my discussions with people who call themselveschristian ministers or pastors, ended by their saying that proof andlogic are useless, and their belief in and love for Jesus Christ (Peace be upon him) that they conceive as god does not require any kind of proof. Other discussions were not better.Therefore, firstly christians who claim Jesus' divinity do not have the right to criticize Islam in the name of cross, based on reasoning and proofs. They can just say we do not accept Islam, unconditionally.Second, all arguments against Islam are either irrelevant or wrong. If you have read the book you have the opportunity to understand this simply by visiting sites that answer those questions...Third, why this book is called Answering Islam instead of Attacking Islam? Islam already accepts God, JesusChrist, all prophets. Authors obviously attack Islam, not even criticize it..."
1,could've been better,"I've read this book twice and I can't beLIEve what the authors say. They should open their mind, read and learn from other religions such Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, etc. All religions teach their adherents to respect truth. Only in Christianity fiction and imagination is considered fact. I should have spent my money and time better."
2,biased? - i think so,"well, what can i say? Another attack on islam, this time coming in the literary form. As if those taking place in palestine were not enough, we find books like these.So, is the book worth reading? If you want 400 pages of anti-islamic material thrown in your face, go ahead. I have read it, and frankly, all the authors seem to have done is picked up a commentary on the quran, maybe tafseer ibn kathir, and all the verses that have required explanation, the authors have placed them in and claimed they are contradictions/errors etc. Biblical referances seem to be scarce, and difficult to come by - if a scholar wrote a critical study of the bible, i am sure there would not be many christians in the world left.anyways, if you want the islamic side, try to obtain the book ""Izharul-haq by Rahmatullah kiranwi (in arabic). An english trasnlation has been undertaken, but very difficult oto come by. I hope this review helps. It is my 3rd one. The other 2 have never appeared."
1,Interesting Imitation,It is a very inexpensive tire cover with none of the normal security devices included with rear mounted spare tire covers. It is simply a pouch with an elastic band that is not compatible with the security bolts on the Honda CRV.The material feels like denim and the Honda/CRV logo are printed on there pretty good. There is no tag or any kind of country of origin marks on this product.Unless you live in a perfect neighborhood or a town where people won't be tempted to rip you off I suggest you save up a little more and get an authentic cover with a bit of security.
4,Exactly what I ordered and it fit perfectly,I chose this rating bacause it is just a tire cover but better than the one i received on my original Honda. The elastic is better than zippers.
4,Looks SO much better!,I needed a new spare tire cover since the old one was cracked and flapping in the breeze. This one went on SO much easier and looks just great!
5,Great CS,"Great cover for a small price. Compared to buying a new original cover, I saved $50 and got a fine vinyl denim cover with a quality CR-V stamp. A bungee problem on the first cover was quickly taken care of by Tim with great communication and customer service. An original cover could be stolen by unzipping 3 short zippers, so I don't feel this cover is more likely to be stolen. I am very satisfied with the cover and happy with the customer service."
4,Honda CR-V vinyl cover review,I am very happy with the vinyl cover. It fits very well and it looks nice. I received this item quickly and it is much better than the old beat-up cover I had on my 2004 Honda CR-V.
5,CRV spare tire cover,This is a great cover. It fits snugly and does not move. Great price and great looking. Nothing cheap about it.
5,Honda CRV Spare Tire Cover,This was a really good product for quality and price. I would recommend it to anyone looking for one. The cost was way below that of the dealership.
3,Good product...like it,Fits like a glove. It covers the tire like a cover should. I like the elastic that hugs the tire tight and secure.
5,Very nice,"The cover fits the spare on my 1997 CR-V perfectly, very nice I would say this cover is better then Honda's"
3,Honda CRV tire cover,Overall its is great. Only flaw is that it isn't as black as i wanted it to be. Its kind of a black gray type.
4,Great replacement at a great price,"I needed a cover for my CRV spare tire and this one works perfectly. It's easy to put on the tire, looks great, and the price is so much less than what you would pay from the dealership. Definitely recommended."
4,"3"" rear bumper brackets worked out OK",Item worked as it should. Directions didn't seem to easy to follow but I was able to figure it out and do the installation.
5,Everything you could want from a novel,"Davis-Gardner may have pulled off this year's most entertaining book with the greatest number of irons in the fire--history, culture, literature and all that, but what keeps the pages turning is a good old-fashioned mystery, a morality play of trust and betrayal, of guilt and shame and secrets, a clash of civilizations and, yeah, even I got caught up in the romance (which was steamy as a Japanese bathhouse...) I started it sort of thinking, ""Here we go, another Japan book,"" but found I was learning all kinds of new things from different, unwritten-about perspectives. I read it in two sittings. Couldn't put it down. What a gem--I hope a major house picks up the paperback so it can get the notice it deserves."
2,so - so,"I think the author's focus was too much on the description of Japan in the 60's and the lives of Hiroshima survivors. The descriptions were good, but she didn't pay much attention to character development; they were flat,all over the place, and I didn't really care about them. The female main character just got downright annoying toward the end. The last 1/3 of the book was too long, and it dragged out trying to be profound."
3,Not what I hoped...,"While the potential of a wonderful book is there, I think this one lacks in a quite a few areas.Barbara is a bit needy and I think she feels a little too entitled. She seems to get possessive of Michi's belongings anytime she see's someone else with them. Seiji is just downright annoying. His temperment is so erratic that I just got tired of him.I also wasn't impressed with the writers style. Most of the book felt too ""choppy"" and the story too rushed.I think the story itself was wonderful, but just could have been better executed."
3,"Story Powerful, Characters Not","This is a novel that I very much wanted to like, because of its examination of the horrors of Hiroshima: or, I should say, the horrors experienced by the survivors. The book is set in Japan during the 1960s and the two main characters are Barbara, an American, and Seiji, Japanese. There's a kind of mystery in that Barbara inherits a chest full of bottles of plum wine, each one bottled and labeled in a different year, from the 1930s onward. As she tries to determine the origins of the wine and the chest, she has a love affair with Seiji.The Japanese setting and customs are gripping, but the two main characters are not. Ultimately, they are needed to bring the story to life, but they just aren't there as interesting, fully developed characters. But I did enjoy the writing and and setting."
2,"Expected more, not enough depth","Maybe my expection was too high. The story did not have enough depth and seemed to be written for ""easy reading"" level. Did not keep my interest although I completed the book."
2,"No plum, not even close","I began this book with relish, ended with boredom and anger at spending even the short time it took to read. The characters were thready and shallow. What I felt promised to be a beautiful love story among historical significance, fell flat and left me feeling annoyed. There was some hope about half way through that the author would deliver but it's almost as if she tired of her own story and just coasted downhill, offering the reader no reward for plodding through the final laborious chapters."
2,Learned a few things about Japan and that's it!,This novel has some disjointed plotlines that try to converge in an unrealistic yet shocking way towards the end. It reminds me of someone on an interminable program abroad who doesn't remember how to get back home. There is some historical information about Japan that is mildly interesting but could better be discovered in a non fiction book. I wouldn't recommend this book.
1,Give this dull book a miss.,"This book was extremely dull. My book club read it and all 12 of us were disappointed. No character development and what little there was, left you completely unsympathetic to them. I can't believe this book got such rave reviews. I would not recommend it to anyone. Luckily our hostess actually had lived in Japan and purchased the pottery the book mentions, otherwise I would have walked away without any idea of what it looked like. No power of description. DULL! Give it a miss."
5,Blender News,My blender is now working again and I did not have to return it to the manufacturer and pay a $40 shipping fee for a $50 blender!
2,Confusing,"This appeared to be the right part for my blender, but there were no instructions on how to remove the old part to make the repair."
3,Cuisinart WAS probably a great product line,"This plastic part arrived nice, clean and new. I am sure it would have worked great if Cuisinart wasn't such a joke. Once I opened up my Cuisinart blender, I could see why the plastic around the blade cracked. One of the screws that holds that motor in place wasn't even in the socket and the screw on the same side was loose. This caused the motor to not be stable which made the driver clutch and blade part not have good contact. Thank you Cuisinart for charging me a lot of money for a crappy machine. I now have a driver clutch and a new blade that I cannot use. How does a company with a great reputation make such, FU customer, products?"
4,Installation,It took me a little bit to figure out the appropriate way to install this. The key to installing it is obviously to get off the brass fitting that is reversed thread (righty loosy/lefty tighty).1) Remove the bottom cover of the blender2) Use a flat head screwdriver to hold the drive shaft of the motor in place (opposite end where the brass fitting is). There is a slot there for that.3) Use pliers to hold the brass fitting in place4) Turn the screwdriver clockwise (because of reverse threading)5) Now thread the replacement part on and you are good to go.
3,You can do it,"It took 15 minutes, a flathead screwdriver, a small head Phillips, and a pair of channel lock pliers and the brass fitting came off rather easily. Take the time to turn the base over, unscrew the three screws and remove the motor. Put the screwdrive in the slot at the bottom of the assembly and use the pliers to unscrew the brass fitting. It'll come off easily enough. The hardest part is putting it back together and realigning the motor and housing screws. Piece of cake.$12 with shipping vs another piece of plastic in the landfill(priceless)I only gave three stars since I still need to see if the part fits when it arrives in a couple of days:)LEW"
5,Fixed my blender,"This part on my blender completely broke apart, but finding a replacement was just the ticket. Shipping is a little high though."
3,expensive little piece of plastic,"Expensive little piece of plastic but that beats having to buy a new blender. Removing the broken one to replace it can be challenging though and it will break again, it's just a matter of time. A shame that manufacturers of good products decide to switch manufacturing key components of their products to plastic or is it ""planned obsolescence"", most consumer will buy a new blender, I did twice before trying to see if a replacement part was available and if the part was replaceable"
4,Blender Blade driver Clutch,"Amazon.com made it easy for me to find this small item for my broken Cuisinart blender, model SPB7. For just few dollars the blender blade driver clutch saved me from buying a new blender. It was delivered fast and with instructions on how to put it together properly."
4,Nice introduction to Paris,"Visually, this book is stunning. And the idea is sweet. (no pun intended) But it doesn't quite get 5 stars because the story is too simple to maintain interest for repeated readings. Still, in a small group setting, as an introduction to Paris, this book would work nicely. And who wouldn't love a followup with real crepes! Couple this with THE COWS ARE GOING TO PARIS (David Kirby and Allen Woodman)for a more comical adventure!"
4,love,"I needed these paints for a craft project, painting doll faces. They shipped quickly and they are the perfect size"
2,Kiddie Bass,"I picked up this bass thinking a short scale would help me out (I'm a female with smaller hands). My instructor about killed me! The single pick-up was terrible and NOT gig-worthy. Save a little more money, and do your homework before shelling out money for a bass."
3,"I like the product, but my kid didn't","I like the soap and the concept of having big-boy or big-girl soap, but my kid didn't. He went to my bathroom and got my Bath and Body foaming soap, moved it to his bathroom, and gave his kid sister his soap. Don't spend the extra money, get him/her a bottle of soap just like yours."
1,Bad car Charger.,"The car-charger stinks! It is not the supplier, it is the manufacturer. One of them lasted me only days. Finally, I found a good car-charger at office Max, brand name ""Just Wireless"" at about $20."
1,More christian foolishness.,"The TAO and christianity have absolutely no common bonds...Taoism teaches self-sufficiant behavor and beliefs...christianity requires ""belief"" in supernatural mythical dieties, that require ""groveling and worshiping"" for a supposed afterlife. This is directly opposed to Taoist beliefs...Don't was your money, if your a Taoist"
5,Cordless impact wrench,I was very pleased with the product and price. I just had a need for it and it worked fine. I actually was looking for a couple batteries and a charger and at the dewalt store they cost more than the impact wrench set.
2,This Book Lacks Real Solutions,"This book appears more to be an alarmist than pointing out a real solution to what the author considers as a growing problem. Since 2001 PATRIOT Act, the main problem civil liberities activists have is monitoring international calls from suspected terrorists. If this is all the problems these people have including the author, other than speculating what might happen, then there is no real problem with the 2001 PATRIOT Act that's going to take the average American's liberities away."
5,Shopping in a book that is great,These books are excellent. They may start off slow but you will soon not have to put the book down. Any easy fun read that you won't want to miss out on. I can't wait for the next book!
5,Fun easy reading...,"The Shopaholic books are one of my favorite entries into the so-called ""chick lit"" genre. Main character Rebecca Bloomwood faces many of the same problems that any girl would face, including how to balance your bank account with all the fashion that you want to buy. As she stumbles her way through London, Manhattan, marriage, a baby, and an unknown sister, I happily turned the pages to find out more of each story.The first book does vary from the movie, and I think it does for the better. Even if you've seen the movie, I think you can still be entertained and surprised by the book.If you are looking for some easy reading, perfect for the beach or when you really don't want to have to think too hard, these books are a great option!"
2,Fun but finger keeps getting stuck,My daughter received this toy as a birthday present and instantly loved it and never gets bored of it. However her finger constantly get stuck in the part of the toy where Dora pops out of when trying to push her back in. This has also happened to my older niece when she comes over to play. Today it left a mark on her finger and I am no longer allowing her to play with it. I want to exchange it for something similar since she loves it so much. Anyone else have this problem?
3,Not too bad.,"I really enjoyed this record for its restlessness. It sure doesn't sound like Graham's settling down any. Some of the cuts just completely rock with no abandon. The more experimental stuff is interesting, as well. Lake is quite beautiful in its ragged rhythms and building sonic textures. I was quite impressed that he played all the instruments on the whole album. I see this, his solo career, as a continuing vent/experiment for Graham. This album didn't blow me away, but considering that the whole thing was supposedly made in 2 weeks, it's not bad at all. The next one will surely be even better.I wouldn't really be able to recommend it casually to just anyone, but if you like Graham's work, then give it a whirl."
5,Graham forever !!,Graham is definately a real artist on his own... no doubt that he doesn't need Blur anymore... but blur might need him NOW !! too late... graham is doing his best and that's OUR pleasure !! Thank you so much Graham !!!!!
2,"Porn, the early days","Visually, these are a step up from the other colection of loops that 42nd St. Pete has made available. Again, Pete's intros and histories are more interesting then the actual loops, which are tedious and kind of dull. They are truly a case of ""if you've seen one, you've seen 'em all."" Yep, that's a young John Holmes or Seka, and so what? There's a slight historical interest in seeing what passed for porn in the days before VCRs, but that only goes so far. These at least have a much better look then the stuff shot in the 60s, so that's a blessing, but these really are for a specialized taste, or for an older viewer who might be nostalgic for what turned him on way back when. I'm not that viewer, so a few of these loops go a long way."
4,A decent first guide for Romania,"I bought this book recently just to see what did I miss on my Romania trips. The book is fairly outdated on the modern stuff, but given the rate of development in Romania, any book would be in 2-3 years. The historical facts are mostly accurate, and the location of sites are great. There is thought much more to say and see about Bucharest than what's written in the book. If you want a proper tour of the city, get a tour guide. The commentaries about modern day Romania and Romanians are somehow exaggerated (or taken at second or third hand). If it's your first trip it's a decent book, but don't rely solely on it."
3,"Bigger than expected, but otherwise great.","The jewelry is bigger than I expected, but otherwise as listed. The package says it is 1/4 inch. I'm not sure how it is supposed to be measured, but the whole thing comes closer to 1/2 inch.The form is really nice, it is easy to insert the jewelry and it is comfortable to wear flipped up or down."
3,Much smaller then I thought.,"I have been looking for a horse-shoe nose ring and I thought this was the one, but no. It is a very good retainer but it's REALLY small. I was hoping this would do the job of both a retainer and I would be able to wear it out but it doesn't. Although, my nose is huge so, it's all relative. : ) I did get the package quickly."
5,Unforgettable Journey,"It was over a decade ago when I first heard this story. Since then, I've worn out two sets of tapes and had to purchase the CDs. It was well worth it! The story is an excellent work of modern fantasy and features an incredible audio palette of sound that transports you to another world...humorous, smart, and very entertaining!"
1,Terrible!,"The title of this book should be a copy of MVRDV. The author should realize that people can't be decieved this way, who is he trying to cheat????"
4,A great little bible dictionary!,I bought this item recently and was pleasantly surprised by the content. I have larger dictionaries that are not as thorough as this one. I think it will be perfect for taking on trips while I study the bible. I would recommend this product.
5,A Great Disc Just Got Even Better,"I will not go on as to how exceptional the two albums on this CD are; there is already much comment to their praise on Amazon. I will say that if you are not familiar with Big Star, and you are a fan of The Beatles or any of the musically inspired music of the 70's, you will absolutely love these guys. I have both the original vinyls and CD of this release and if you own a SACD player this is a must have. Positively brilliant!"
3,Good but not great,"My wife and I have been dark chocolate lovers for a long time. The Leonidas product was well packed and kept cool with insulation. Package was delivered just two days after order. The range of flavors is wide in this assortment however we were disappointed with the overall lack of dark chocolate ""impact"" we see get with a similar Godiva product. Chocolate outer shells are waxy."
3,"Average chocolate, strong fillings","These are definitely ""mid-range"" chocolates, not quite as good as Godiva or See's. If you're used to low-end chocolates like Fannie May or Russell Stover, you'll probably find these to be very good. However, if you're used to very good chocolates like La Maison du Chocolat, you'll be sorely disappointed.I found the chocolate to have unexceptional flavor and a somewhat waxy texture. The fillings were mostly very sweet or alcoholic, which is a common practice to cover up mediocre chocolate.I guess they're a good value compared to Godiva, although I think See's Candies has an even better value. Don't expect Leonidas to compare to a high-end chocolatier."
2,Some Flaws in the Candy,"First thing is their web site. It is terrible. I wanted to complain about their candy but was unable to do so on account of the web site. Secondly, there were little sugar crystals imbedded in the chocolate that were quite noticeable and ruined both the flavor and the texture. I would not buy them again."
2,Can't judge by the wrapping,"Upon hearing that I love chocolate, a friend sent this. I ate a couple of pieces and threw the rest away. It was waxy and not the least bit sweet. Choxie is creamier and more flavorful than this stuff."
3,Disc information,"Being that the titles do not seem to be provided as of 1/11/2008, this DVD has the following movies on three discs:PassionFirst Name: CarmenThe DetectiveOh Woe is MeThese movies were made in the 1980s and 1990s. Although lesser known, they are supposedly interesting, if not spectacular, films for Godard fans."
1,Awful!!!,"The films are stupid, pointless and sloppily done. Plus the unnecessary underage nudity made them even more offensive. No wonder they're forgotten."
2,Plating wears off after a month or two,"I bought this because I loved the Tiffany version. It looks okay at first, but now my 7 year-old has it because I wouldn't be caught dead wearing it with the plating falling off."
1,Not worth $62,"I purchase this bracelet because it was such a steal. It ended up being too good to be true. The view shown of the product is only for one side. The other side is hollow so if the bracelet flips over it looks really cheap. It is definitely not worth $62. This was a disappointment, but working with Eves Addiction was easy. I was able to exchange the bracelet for two necklaces. I received the exchanges within a week from when I sent the order."
5,The best living jazz female singer around!,"I bought the cd secondhand because I was interested to hear Miss Carol Kidd (Member of the British Empire since 1998). This compact disc is a classic that Gershwin would be so proud to have this Scottish lady sing her heart. Her voice is soft, gentle, and wonderful to listen to regardless of the lyrics. I would encourage Linn Records to rerelease this album again. It is a timeless treasure! Carol Kidd is herself a genius! All composers and lyricists would be proud and thrilled to have her sing their songs and lyrics."
2,Smells really bad,I was disappointed with this product. It smells awful so I would definitely recommend using this only at night (and only if you're going to be alone). It also has a very low concentration of medicine (1%). I used this all over my face and then put the drying lotion on over it and it worked okay but I've used better.
5,Must Read,"Wonderfully informative & warmly inspirational; professionally written, and with a great deal of love; a must read for anyone personally touched by or professionally involved in adoption"
2,O.K.-But Not Great!,"I received the product as promised, however I did not find the comedy to be funny. I would not recommend it to anyone."
2,COMEDY,"It's not as funny as I thought that it would be. I thought that another comedian would perform, but he didn't..."
2,Kindle Book Review,Have the book in hard copy - excellent value. Rating is for the Kindle version. A book about coping with learning disabilities and the publisher has NOT enbabled Text To Speech?Kind of ironic if it wasn't so sad. Won't buy any Kindle edition unless Speech is enabled.
5,This book saved my 1st semester @ Grad School!!,"I had leafed through this book one day in the library and it looked interesting. So, I bought one and I keep it with me always! I use it like a reference book. I found the chapters on reading and writing for people with learning disabilities the best. Once I started using the techniques, I saved my semester and my Grad School career! I was on academic probation and had to pass all classes (I'd gotten an ""F"") before. When I came back to try Grad school again, I had two ""D's"" at mid terms my first semester back! I read the book from cover to cover and kept it with me after that. I went from two ""D's"", a ""B"", and an ""A"" to two ""A's"", a ""A-"", and a ""B"" over the next six weeks. By the time finals came I was in the clear. The next semester I got straight ""A's"" for the first time in my life! All using techniques from this book! You have to get it. If you have ADHD or another learning disability like I do, it will help for sure!"
5,In a class (room) by it's self.,"And I don't mean the one with the corny posters of animals with sayings about staying postive! You know, the ""retard room"" as many a cruel kid has termed it. At least the ones that made me misereable did. This book is truly a God-send! While geared towards LD college students like myself, the mature high schooler could benefit from reading it as well. The book is written with humor and many pratical suggestions that I have used. Jon, whom I had the pleasure of meeting, and David are now heros to a fellow Special Ed'er who thinks she just might make it after all."
5,A must read for all...,"I have a twelve year old dyslexic son, and after reading the chapter on Jonathan Mooney's story I looked at my son and saw tears in his eyes. Some were for Jonathan and some were for himself... This book comes from the heart and it shows.Both Jonathan's and David's stories are lived out everyday in our educational institutions. The educators need to be educated as to the kind of damage and tremendeous influeance they have on our young children. What they say and do is carried forward with these students. We must insure that the gifts of these unique children are recongnised, supported and developed. It is time we stop putting so much emphisis on what they can't do and see what they can. Like Jonathan and David..."
1,Unsuitable language,"I would have liked to buy this book after reading some of the reviews, but the vulgar language turned me off. It's unnecessary, and makes the book totally unsuitable reading for anyone who prefers to live outside the garbage can. Sorry, folks - your readers deserve to hear your message, but your language puts up a barrier that makes it impossible."
2,without the profanity it would have been a great book,"I was very disappointed to find that the language in this book is extremely course, including liberal use of the ""F"" word, especially in chapter 1 written by Jonathan. I bought this book hoping it would be a useful tool for my 13 year old daughter as she prepares for high school and college. However, she will not be reading this book anytime soon. Maybe when she finishes college! The author excuses his language by saying it was normal in the home where he grew up. I've always believed that using such language is unimaginative."
5,best parenting book I've read,"Best parenting book I've read and that's saying a lot. My two sons are now young men in their 20's, and I read many, many parenting books over the years. Now, we have a young woman from another country living with us, and I find myself revisiting the author's advice all over again. No other author held up the mirror to my own behavior, and the behavior I've observed in other parents, so clearly as this one. The off hand comments and questions we put to our children; the ones we view as innocent or just showing our concern for them, are subtle efforts to control their behavior, and adolescents recognize them for what they are. That's what they rebel against. It's so ingrained that it really is hard work to excise these behaviors, but the pay off is peace and a better relationship with those we love.The book is very clear with concrete examples. I've recommended it to many parents over the years."
5,"If you have a difficult relationship with your teen, buy this book!","This book is a gem. If you find yourself having frequent screaming matches with your teen, this book will rescue you. It will help you learn how to develop a relationship with your teen so that with every interaction, you will be letting her know that you care about her and you trust her. As you grow as a parent, so will your relationship. Your teen will start to care about you too and he will be more willing to talk to you."
5,Parent/Teen Breakthrough,"Excellent book for parents with preteens and teens. It is full of very compelling examples of behaviors that can be expected if a solid relationship between the parent and child has not been established. The crux of the problem is often the parent. We are comfortable controlling our children (it works) when they are smaller and we're quite surprised when they begin to mature and really need us to be a best friend. The book does not preach, but clarifies the value of building a new relationship. Perfectly appropriate for people of any religious faith. It is a gift that I give to parents very often."
4,A Fresh Perspective...,"This book challenges parents to examine the underlying reason that teens act the way they do.....namely, that they are moving toward independence. They need to figure out the world and their place in it as separate from their parents. Kirshenbaum gives examples of ways in which teens assert their independence and gives ideas how parents can facilitate this process while still giving their teens loving guidance.A great resource for parents during the maddeningly difficult teen years."
1,Forgettable Trash,Buddy Rich will be remembered as a great drummer during the big band era of the 60s.He won't be remembered as the Funkadelic Jazzrock maker who knew how to get down and boogie with his soul brothers of the 70s.At would at least help if the brass section could at least be together and hit the right notes - instead it comes across as some sort of noise you would hear if a bunch of animals got excited in a zoo.
1,BE CAREFUL,I BOUGHT THIS CAR FOR MY FIRST BORN. LIKE OTHER MOTHERS I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY AFFORDABLE AND STYLISH. UNTIL ONE DAY I DECIDED TO TAKE MY NEW BORN FOR AN OUTTING TO SEE FAMILIE (KEEP IN MIND THE FIRE DEPARTMENT INSTALLED MY CAR IN MY VECHILE) I MADE A LEFT TURN MY NEW BORN STARTED CRYING I LOOKED IN THE MIRROR TO CHECK ON HER AND I DID NOT SEE THE CAR SEAT IT HAD TURNED OVER CARRIER AND BASE. SO PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN BUYING A CARSEAT.
2,DON&#65533;T BUY IT!,"Like many of you, when I first bought this, I was new to classical music. Since it had a good customer rating, I thought it would be a good purchase. It was a waste of money. Half the songs on the CD are songs that have been worn out by commercials and other Hollywood productions (like the ""Lone Ranger"" song). The biggest problem with this CD set is that most of the songs are incomplete. And even those incomplete songs contain variations of the same worn out classical tunes. This CD set is definitely not worth the money."
5,A Great Set,"This is a great set of classical standards and a wonderful addition to any music lovers library wether new to classical music or not. If you enjoy this you may also want to check out ""The Most Relaxing Classical Album Ever"" and John McArthur's, ""HIDDEN."" They are all exceptional albums."
4,Great Set!,This is a wonderful set. It is very relaxing to play while driving the car. The only negative for me is the frequent volumn changes I need to make since the soft pieces are very soft and loud pieces are very loud. The variety is terrific and the set will make a great addition to anyone's music collection.
3,It's ok,"I like listening to it, even though some of the pieces have been shortened. The only problem I have with it is that some of the pieces are mislabeled. Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue(Andante) is actually the Finale, and instead of the Finale on the next track it goes to ""Morning"" from the Peer Gynt Suite. Then instead of ""Morning"" on the next track you get the Hallujah Chorus, and so on."
2,Blah,"The only reason this cd gets two stars, is that the intended song selection was initially good. However, the cd sounds like (you know what). I'm not an audio expert, but I think they individually recorded each instrument individually in a sound room, and then mixed all of them together, for all of the songs. A lack of big-hall sound gives it a hollow / empty feeling when listening to it. Save your money or look elsewhere!"
2,Not that good.,"The only good thing I can say is that it includes about 10 songs I personally love.But I can also say it includes at least 5 songs that are extremely cheesy.The rest of the songs are in the so-so category :)But what I find really dissappointing is the volume leveling, its terrible!Just to mention a few, Monlight Sonata (Beethoven) and Clair De Lune (Debussy) are barely hearable, increasing the volume not only causes white noise but it will break your ears when playing one of the loud songs (like the March Of The Toreadors)."
2,Eh.,This book is alright but I don't like how the words have a line that connects to the body part. Young kids will not understand this concept and by the time they do they will be old enough to already know the body parts.
3,A little advanced for a one year old,There seem to be too many pictures per page. My 12 mo old isn't very engaged in it. It's a little too busy for an effective teaching tool for a kid this age. May be better for a 2 year old.
5,One of the best!,"My LO (now 9.5 months) loves picture books that capture her attention and are of things she sees on a daily basis. This book hits the jackpot! Smaller than I expected, it packs a HUGE punch. Not only is the body covered complete with differentiating characteristics (is straight, curly hair), but expressions, movements, clothes, and activies that make sounds. (meaning you see the baby splashing in water)Since my daughter does so many of these things it's great to teach her the words for them and help connect the activity or part with a picture.She loves helping me turn pages and touching the pictures"
4,Cute book to keep lil one busy with,"This is a great book to have on hand to help your little one recognize all it's body parts along with facial expressions. Although it doesn't keep my son interested for very long I can go over body parts in sections. I Gave it 4 stars because I expected the book to be bigger, it's actually a very smal book (maybe about 5 inches) so it's a book to keep maybe in your baby bag..."
5,A hit with my kid!,My son loves this series of books. He will sit there for a good length of time paging through it over and over! Which for a 15 month old is something!
3,"The book is good, Just easy to rip","I bought this book for my daughter when she was only 4 months old and thought it would last well into her school age because it seemed like a sturdy board book. She is now 16 months old and the book is pretty much destroyed. Technically the pages are just ripped off the spine, so I can still tape it up together. The content is good, though. She can point to all the body parts and likes to look at all the baby faces. Just a warning if you do intend to buy this book for a baby, don't let them chew on it. I think that's what softened up the book so it was easier to rip apart. I just know for the price of the book I would rather just buy it for a toddler who already has learned how to treat books."
5,"Excellent for groomers, not made for amateurs","These skip tooth blades are awesome, but if you aren't a groomer or don't know much about grooming, look for finish cut blades. These can be dangerous when used in the wrong areas on the body. Otherwise, these blades whiz through thick and matted hair! Amazing :)"
1,NOT for really thick fur.,I have used Oster products for pets and professionally for as long as I can remember and was never before disappointed. I thought this blade would be suitable for a large Belgian Malinaus with a very thick coat. Our older dog suffers during our brutal heat in Texas. The blade wouldn't even start to cut his fur so I shaved him down with a regular Oster #5 with no problem.
4,heavy,very nicely made durabale easy to clean nice attachment for the clippers. they are heavy and easy to change when needed.
4,Doesn't overheat,"Not as easy as a # 10 blade,to cut with, as the hair is longer when cut with a #5.Blade remains quite cool, for the first hour of cutting. My standard poodle was not uncoverable while being clipped with this blade."
2,Not an Instructional Video,"I thought this was a how to video as well, I reserved it at the library and was excited to get it thinking I would be doing qi gong. I popped it in the VCR and it was just mostly discussion which isn't so bad, because I learned more about qi gong, but my overall thing is I wanted to actually practice qi gong."
5,Battleground Rocks!,This is a great game for the whole family! I remembered playing this game when I was a little girl with my brothers and just had to find it for my boys(2 and 5). My husband didn't really care but went along with my desires. After the first time of playing the game my husband became obsesed. He is the one that wants to play it all the time and because daddy does by boys do to. So we divide the family and everyone gets involved. My husband and I even fight over who gets to pair up with our two year old because he has the perfect touch with the catapult.
1,We returned it,"I loved Crossbows and Catapults as a kid, so we bought this one. As soon as we looked at it, we sent it back. The images were grotesque, some of the pieces looked like little demons. Not what we wanted! I found the vintage one on ebay, and our family loves it."
5,Tastes Great!,"I have followed Laura's recipes in Muscle and Fitness for the last couple of years and have made at least a half dozen of her outstanding recipes. I was thrilled to learn of this book and was equally happy when it arrived-the recipes are easy to make, there's plenty of variety from main cource type meals to desserts that are suprisingly, very low in fat and sugar but good tasting too. I would suggest this book to anyone who is lookig for a cook book that is low in fat but has recipes that you really use!!! I hate books that are filled with useless, hard to make, thousand ingredient recpes"
5,"Delicious food, with no guilt...","These recipes are incredible... light, low on fat, and healthy across the board. Each recipe features a nutritional breakdown so you can figure it into your diet program. Laura spares none of the taste in putting together an incredible variety of flavors, tastes, and ethnic styles. Having attended Club Creavalle in Florida, I can vouch first hand for the passion Laura has for cooking. She manages to find creative ways to make even the most sinful sounding foods (like her World Famous Cheesecake[a must try], or even Tiramisu) taste just as good, without the high fat content. If you're looking for a great cookbook to keep you on your diet, without sacrificing flavor, this is the one!!"
5,Finally!,"I am a new fitness competitor, and I had a hard time adjusting to the ""off season"". I didnt know how to eat, and how to cook! This book has become my staple. I have made soooo many recipes in here and have yet to be disappointed. The fact that she breaks down the macronutrients is wonderful for those of us that need to watch them closely! I even think it would be great for someone who wants to learn about a healthy lifestyle.The banana fudge cake is wonderful!!!!!"
5,Classic way to help young ones learn the states.,"I had a puzzle map of the USA when I was a kid, fifty years ago. I still remember many state capitals and have a pretty good sense of where the states of the union are located. I gave this to my grand nephew, age 6, on Christmas Eve and he was into it right away and was able to put it all together with the help of the photo from the package. As an educational tool, for kids who like to handle things, and put things together, this is a perfect match."
3,Not exactly what I was looking for.,"The puzzle pieces are sort of ""roughly"" cut. I was expecting them to be more precision cut, and the words are pretty small and somewhat hard to read."
5,Great puzzle,"In the last few weeks, my boys have enjoyed putting the puzzle together multiple times. Sturdy, and just what a map should be. It's not overly detailed but that's not the main point of the puzzle."
5,Great Learning Tool!,"My second grader loves this puzzle! He's put it together several times since Christmas. The wood base shows the capitals, but not the states or their shapes, so he's really learning where each state goes and is starting to even learn the capitals. Would recommend for ages 7-10."
5,US map jigsaw,We live in Ireland and on our last holiday to the US I bought this for my wife to improve her US geography. It is very well built and the pieces interlock well together - however I think after a few months use the wooden base is tending to bow a little. However an excellent educational aid for all ages.
5,Great wooden map,I bought this for my daughter. It was just like the one I had as a kid. She used it multiple times when she first got it. Great geography tool. Just make sure you keep the dog away if the pieces fall on the floor.
4,A Great Singer of Russia,"It may be arguable that for Dmitri Hvorostovsky a better version of ""Largo al factotum"" could have been chosen than the one (concert in Moscow in 1992) in this DVD, but the previous reviewer apparently doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to Dmitri Hvorostovsky."
4,Nautica Voyage,Good product - difficult to find other than on-line just what I was looking for- I have used this product for over 5 years
1,NON SPLASH Knockoff ... be careful!,"No where in the description have they said it's not a splash. As if that is not important!Intentional of course to make you buy it with no return policy either.The original product is my favorite and I had many compliments on it however, this one hardly smells like it and is much more diluted. It doesn't even burn after a shave!Waste of money!Be ware of false advertisement which is why I give it one star coz there is no Zero stars!"
2,Don't waste your time.............,"......because I did! I do like R.A.W., and I feel that he is right on the mark with many things he says. But, my God, if I could only get the time I spent reading this book back. There was one truly engrossing and suspenseful moment of the book when a guy (nope, can't remember his name) was on the phone with another guy (nope, can't remember his name either) pleading with him to get to his home, because creatures from Hell were trying to get in his house. The twist at the end was disappointing, and the process by which the author was trying to build to the climax was irritating."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"My kitchen is a dark red, apple color and these match perfectly. I received them from my daughter for my birthday and they are exactly what I wanted. I have burned similar items in the past by accidentally turning on the wrong burner so, now, when I am cooking I remove all 4 burner covers just in case. Very happy with these!"
5,AWESOME!!,"This book is one of the most intriguing books on the Apollo 11 missions i have ever read, and i HIGHLY recommend it to anyone interested in the Apollo 11 mission"
1,"Good Product , Bad Information","I ordered a Samsung 23"" LCD TV through Amazon. Samsung uses a 200/200 Mount not the 75/100 Mount that comes with this product. I followed the rather weak directions and mounted the unit to my wall only to find out the TV mount does not fit my TV. I now have two large wholes in my wall. Lastly, Monster's customer service does not answer the phone on Saturdays even though their voice message does not exclude any day of the week for service hours.I am glad, I ordered it from Amazon, because the return is easy."
4,Lots of Fun,"Purchased for a puzzle giver and stumped the whole family. Great fun for all, and a simple solution that stumps the best solvers."
5,fun for everyone,"Love this game, so much fun for the entire family. Found this game in san francisco at a puzzle shop, and after leaving I had to get my hands on one for myself. This product was exactly what I was looking for."
5,Awesome!,It took my father-in-law a few days to figure this one out; he absolutely loved it and it was fun to watch. He was constantly picking it up throughout the day; he couldn't leave it alone.
4,Interesting gift idea,"I bought this to give as a gift and was pleased with it. It is fun and definitely a struggle to remove. I would recommend it, especially if you are planning on giving a bottle of wine as a gift and want a fun and interesting way of packaging it. It really doesn't have much replay value though, do it once and then the fun is over. You could just keep regifting it though, everyone who has tried it thought it was such a fun idea."
4,Quality Building Fun,"Rokenbok makes toys for the young inventor or builder. As an alternative to Legos, they allow creative building of larger structures and vehicles. The pieces are a little difficult to snap together or pull apart, which makes the structures more rigid, but also can be difficult for smaller fingers to deal with."
4,A good solid product.,"I've never been disappointed by a Speakman shower head. Next time, however, I'm buying the 5 jet one, this one is fine, but a little more firepower would be nice."
5,Teknon is high adventure for fathers and sons,"It is a remarkable, high adventure story of a young man's initiation into courageous manhood, which includes high risk exposure to dark and evil characters and episodes. Brent Sapp has created a plot line which is compelling, convicting, and as large as the moral challenge that faces us in this complicated world. Young men profoundly need ""rites of passage"" to initiate them into the world of mature manhood. Teknon and the CHAMPION WARRIORS is both a challenge and an invitation to young men and their families to contract for the launching of a CHAMPION.Dr. Donald Joy, author and Director Center for the Study of the Family"
2,Too basic for anyone over 21,The information was far too basic for anyone with any degree of financial sophistication. It is only geared toward someone who receives a paycheck every two weeks. I wish that something on the cover had indicated that it would not address financial problems of small business owners or one who earns commissions.
5,His Words Ring,A beautifully written glimpse into one man's decisions and struggles -- from the huge unexpected sojourn into priesthood to the ultimate question of faith and beliefs. Mr. Mattimore's stories shimmer in their truth. He seems a guy we'd all want to invite for Sunday pasta; his words of earnest humility and ultimate goodness ring.
3,Decent,"""The late Corlinda Corville had always run other people's affiars; even death could not stop her. Corlinda had invited her grandniece Lynn Marston to vist England. But when the lovely American arrived, she found that her great-aunt had died and left her a sizable bequest: a fabulous estate, a phenomenal fortune, and abundandt jewelry, which included the royal stuart necklace. All would be hers, provided she marry one of three cousins: aristocratic Anthony, stylish Rollin, or sensitve Myles."" After she refuses all three cousins the murder attempts begin, but no one will believe her.The characters are decent and the book steers clear of full-blown cliches. The romance is sweet and lower-key than many regency romances. It's not a brilliant book, but it was an enjoyable way to spend a few hours."
2,Bag cover,"Doesn't fit bags if they are full. The side bags were full and top extended, but not over loaded and cover was too hard to fit. I gave up."
3,Amazon just couldn't get this right!,"This product is fine. I ordered it with the Topeak Trunk Bag. They arrived together on time. The trunk bag was missing a shoulder strap. When I reported the missing shoulder strap they sent me a replacement rain cover. Even though I very specifically confirmed they were sending me a strap. ""you're just sending a strap, right? I don't want to bother with any exchanges."" ""Yes""But they shipped the cover and want the original back. When I spoke to a rep she was kind enough to credit me for the missing strap and promised to eliminate the return request on the cover. But I'm getting reminders now that the cover needs to be returned or they'll charge my credit card. It's a hassle you hope to avoid."
4,"I liked this, it's effective, but I wish it was a bit larger","While the MTX DXP will resist a certain amount of moisture before the interior of the bag becomes wet, the rain cover is essential to keep the bag dry during a downpour or extended time in the rain. Much like a hiking pack cover, this does the trick.My only complaint is that I wish the bag itself provided more leeway in space for items strapped to the outside of the bag. I find that it's practical to strap tent poles or sandals to the MTX bag itself. The rain cover form fits the bag as it's assembled with little leeway. So, if you have sandals hanging off the top of your bag, you'll need to remove these or find another mechanism for these to be strapped too while the rain cover is on.Only a small complaint; the MTX DXP is an amazing bag and the rain cover is easy to carry and makes it seem almost invincible."
5,Only necessary for very heavy rain,"The bag itself resists light rains well, but if you ride in all weather this is a nice addition to your kit. The cover folds nicely into itself to the size of about 2 decks of cards. It has kept the contents dry through a couple of heavy showers, but I had not yet had it in a downpour. Easy to put on, but makes getting your lock out difficult in the rain! The bright color is also handy for visibility."
4,"Great bag, nice to have. bicycle commuters tool","I just got this with the understanding that my light may not work under the bag... the material is thin enough to let the light through. Understand you will not get full visibility but in the rain a flashing red light will keep those who are looking for you from hitting you, (there is no hope for anyone else) I have no problems at all keeping my light on the access point on the back of the Topeak MTX trunk Bag I keep a spare bottle back there to keep the light pointing up and snug against the rain gear. The nice thing is my light does not get road splatter or rain so I really don't have to think about it. And yes it does catch some rain near the bottom, and it does not cover the bag on the inside next to the tires, (that is where the MTX pannier covers keep out the rain) but come on nothing is perfect and to keep my stuff dry and not letting it get soaked so I can look professional at work is really the most important."
2,not truly helpful,"The main design problem with the rain cover is that water collects and pools inside of it at the bottom of the panniers. When the rear wheel kicks up water it sprays off the bottom of the rack and then drips down the inside of the panniers and collects inside of the rain cover. I do not have fenders, this might mitigate the problem.The fabric is also easily stained by road grime, and quickly turns from pretty yellow to spotted with brown.Overall, I would say it is fairly useless as the panniers get wet anyway and the main compartment is fairly waterproof already as it is protected by the top compartment. Save yourself $15 and just use a plastic grocery bag on the top unless you also plan on investing in a pair of fenders."
4,Topeak Rain Cover - Pretty Good,"This is a pretty nifty, light weight ""rain coat"" for my MTX Trunk Bag DXP. As the other reviewer said, though, it would've been nice if there was a place for a rear light."
5,No brainer,"While the Topeak bags are very weather resistant, they are not waterproof. If you carry important things in your bag you'll want to keep them as safe as possible."
4,Great but....,"Great but inner wall portion of bag(closest to back tire)gets wet. Cover has a small bag attached to it, easy fold in. Packs into a wallet size, will not take much space inside pannier."
4,Concise and entertaining intro to Economics,"This book covered a wide range of topics with articles pertaining to economic issues. The articles were short and entertaining. The questions at the end of the articles were useful and thought provoking. Difficult topics are covered (e.g., rent control, airline safety, drug usage) in a fashion that allowed the reader develop their own opinion of the role economics plays on the issue."
4,Professional Glamour Photography,"Arny Freytag has photographed lots of beautiful ladies for Playboy and other publications. This video takes you behind the scenes on several photo shoots where Arny gives you an insight into how he does it. From the inital meeting with the makeup artist and stylist, through setting the stage, and then directing the model, you see how the final image is created. If the Playboy style is what you're trying to duplicate, here's the video to help you achieve it. Worth the price just for his filter recommendations. They really work!"
3,It misses a cable link.,"I bought it and when I opened I came to realized that a link cable was missing. Even my money was paid back, I can not use it because it's workless without the cable and I don't know where to find it! Sorry. It is now set as one more simple mirror! :("
5,Teaching Young Children Using Themes,"A classic book full of great ideas, organized by themes.The author has done a superb job researching different topics and gives a complete overview on each theme.I have been able to use it often with great success every time.It amazes me that a perfectly good used book can be so useful for a ridiculous low price."
3,Why I will never by a plastic Tonka again!!,"My 31/2 year old son received this for Christmas. He loved it and wanted to play with it all the time! However, the tracks on the bulldozer came off after only a few days..we put them back on, but they continued to come off frequently. The sound of it was WAY TOO LOUD!! Fortunatly, the sounds quit working after 2 months (even with new batteries) Eventually the plastic on it cacked, and I pitched the whole thing. I'm sticking to the metal trucks from now on!!"
2,Skip motorized Tonka . . .,"My parents bought this for my two year old. And while they think it's great - they can go home and not listen to it! It's very noisy and not very durable - forget the sandbox. While my son will play around with it, moving the controls, etc., when he wants to really play, out come the Ertl Tractors and the good ole non-motorized Tonka trucks. Buy two non-motorized items for the price of this one - no ear plugs necessary!"
2,Not so much fun,"I don't know what it is with Tonka, but they've motorized and therefore pretty much ruined a lot of their trucks. My four-year old got this truck as a gift and while it's interesting to him to make it go forward and backward, etc., when it comes to his real ""working"" playtime, he chooses other trucks. This one doesn't have real play value--it's more of a novelty. When we evaluate trucks for our kids, we look for ones they can role play with and engage in open-ended pretending with. This one has no room for a driver and unless you're pretty handy with the controls and willing to really fuss with them, you can't use it to lift loads, etc. I think a manual truck rather than motorized is a much better choice especially for kids on the lower end of the age spectrum."
5,exactly like the picture,got this in its original package and you have to assemble a few things but not too difficult. lol. but its perfect love that hes in motion to strike.
4,High marks for Senator Lott,I thought this was one of the most honest politicalbook I've ever read. Sen. Lott pulled no punches.I was disappointed at the business relationship he had with one of President Clinton's advisors but I still support Lott. I think he got stabbed in the back by other Senate Republicans. I enjoyed the book and would urge politcal junkies to read it.
5,very happy,I was surprised at the great condition of the book just as described pages were never turned and minimal damage to the dust cover
5,Love old things?,"If you like antiques, quirky experts (nobody can do quirky like the British!), and fabulous finds, you will love this book. You do need to have seen the British version to appreciate it though - I don't know if there is an American book equivalent to tie up with their version of the show."
4,Suzy Bogguss is Still A Star,"I always wanted to yodel and tried valiently for many years to learn, without success. Until I listed to this album and sang along with Suzy. She makes it easy...or at least, easier. If you ever want to hear her live, she shows up on the radio show with what's-his-name of Lake Wobegone on NPR every once in a while. I remember his name...Garrison Keiler (sic). It just takes a few seconds longer to recall things when you get to be my age. But it eventually does manage to get through the fog of time."
4,"Very good recipes, clear instruction,...some minor errors","Made a few cookies from this book. In the bars section, I've tried a few recipes but found some typos that made the instruction a little confusing but not difficult to overcome. Didnt' really like the section that used the premix ingredients. Wished that section was written with something a little more interesting. Otherwise a good cookie book to have on hand."
5,Probably the Best Cookie Book Ever,"Betty Crocker's Cookie Book has an excellent and wide range of cookies.We've enjoyed making a number of these cookies, and my work colleagues think my wife's baking is suitably professional for a shop. The great recipes in this book is what they don't know of."
3,"great band,poor sound.","The music is fine,however the sound quality leaves a lot to be desired.It lacks punch and volume,especially on the drums."
4,"very cute, for small heads only","I bought this and the ant one for my boys for Christmas last year or the year before. They're hilarious but they're for very small heads. Think age 6 or younger, and not if they have round heads! We all tried them on to see the effect of looking through the special glass, and it was very cool. We all also looked quite silly with them on, and the kids especially had fun laughing at us adults."
2,Not what I thought,"This book had beautiful pictures and that was about it. If it didn't have the Max Lucado writings there would not have been anything to read, not something I would buy. It's kind of outdated in it's layout"
1,Forget the Rabbit,"We purchased this item. It began to self-destruct in no time. The ""eye"" fell out; the ""chrome"" coating peeled; the innards rusted and the gear movement became erratic. We commented to Amazon[.com] but they said they would only cover it up to two months but that Metrokane would do so for 2 years. The product was returned to them asking for a refund. That was months,letters and multiple emails ago. They essentially ignored us. BUY THE SCREWPULL by Le Creuset. They are a little more but work beautifully - and last forever. Addendum: The company finally did forward a new product after their months of ignoring us ( we actually asked for a refund ). Rest assured - it will stay in the box and be used as a gift. We won't be using it."
3,Clumsy but somewhat effective,The foil cutter is inconsistent which is not a surprise since the actual cutters are plastic. Half the time the cork extractor takes 2 or 3 plunges to extract the cork.
1,Impossible to secure seat base,"This care seat is impossible to safely install. I purchased it for my third child and was desparately looking for a narrow infant seat to fit between my two other children's boosters. The thin profile seemed like the perfect solution, but there is no way to securely install this base. I've been dealing with car seats for seven years now and have never had a problem securing one.... especially with the latch system. With this seat, the base will flip up and slide off of the belt as it is tightened. Even at it's tightest point it can be easily wiggled out of the belt by hand. Combi has a narrow infant seat (but their buckle is EXTREMELY difficult to latch). Now that I have a minivan, I returned to Graco. I highly recommend their infant car seats."
3,Bait and switch,"While the story was engaging and sometimes exhilarating (though it's multiple characters and groups of characters were a bit hard to keep track of), and it has that rare quality of describing the world of computers in a way that matches actual reality, it's ultimately a bit of a tease.When the manuscript is discovered, we never do get to read all of it, which for me at least, was the whole point of picking up this novel. If you're just interested in cyber intrigue and gun fights, you might enjoy this book. But if you're holding out to see the manuscript of the title, don't bother - it isn't here."
4,"good book, a bit dated","As a novice Radial Arm Saw owner, it is extremely educational seeing just what an RAS can do. I never dreamed this tool could do so many things. I do think other tools might be better suited for some of the jobs, but for many sawing operations and for irregular sanding with a disk or drum, it seems to be a real useful addition to a shop.The author is obviously extremely knowledgeable about this saw, and it shows.If you are new or somewhat inexperienced using a radial arm saw, this book will take you way beyond doing cross-cuts or simple mitre cuts."
2,Radial Arm Saws,"This book is way past its prime. The author is top notch, I have other books of his, but this book is just very outdated. I don't believe t to be relevant in today's world."
3,Seems Historically accurate,"This was a good movie, but I found that at times it didn't hold my interest. Easy to follow and great realism."
4,Good Movie,"I thought this movie was pretty good. Its a story about a woman who goes and looks for her brother after her father dies. She dresses up as a man to make it easier for her to find her brother because he joined the Confederate army. During her search for him, she comes across a girl traveling to a relative's home in another state. The girl starts to develop feeling for this ""boy"". If you are looking for a movie that has hot and steamy loving, this isn't going to be that movie. I thought it was a touching movie and the ending is heartbreaking.You can tell this movie is a low budget film but I would still recommend this movie to any of my friends."
4,sweetness on ice,"Nhl-hitz is simply what is is proposed as: adrenaline hockey. if you like mean checks, sweet moves, and lush and lots of goals, this is your game. this game has only one drawback: 3 on 3 hockey with no substititutions. i only wish that there was five on five hockey with more goalie oppurtunities. but, this is a great, fun, exciting game, and if you are willing to give up simulation, nhl hitz will keep you busy for hours!"
3,"Fun, but not Hockey","This is not a bad game by any means. However this is as unrealistic as it gets. If you are just wanting some bone cracking malicious ""unreal"" fun then this is your game. If you want realistic challenging Hockey go with NHL 2002. I personally was not impressed with the game, but my good friend loves it."
5,Great Game!,"My friends and I love this game! It has become a classic in our group. The gameplay is simple enough to master in an hour, but fun enough to keep us coming back to it. It's such a great, simple game. It's more of an arcade sports game, and is the only violent hockey game that I know of. It's 10 years old, so obviously the graphics aren't great, but the game feels right with older graphics. It wouldn't have the same feel with more realistic graphics. Anyways, the gameplay is so fun, my friends and I beat the whole game. You can play the season and win the Stanely Cup with either a present team or your own create-a-team. Create-a-team is great. The unlockables are also fun to get: new stadiums, player heads, etc. I would highly recommend this game. So worth $5."
2,The worst hockey agme out there....so unrealistic,"Believe me NHL 2K2 And NHL 2002 totally waste NHL Hitz which is so unrealistic. The only good things about this game is the play-by-play announcing, the graphics and the great, easy controls. HItz is just terrible form there. The gameplay is not the NHL! If you have played NBA Shwotime you know what I mean. This game is 3-3 ""NHL"" hockey with terrible gameplay. The computer is so easy to get around, they barely check you, but it is impossible to score. Then on the other end the computer scores right away. I gave up 3 goals in a mater of 1 minute. Also just like in Midway's other games when you shoot the puck smoke comes out of it. It is very unrealistic. I still find this game pretty fun though. If you own an X-Box don't waste 50 bucks ont his game and get EA's NHL 2002. I thought this would be a good game, but Midway blew it again. But if you enjoy playing NFL BLitz or NBA Showtime and want some fun buy this game."
1,BE WARNED!!!!,"If you enjoy downloading your own music into games, or currently have more than 24,000 blocks of memory devoted to music saved to your hard drive, you might not want this game. The game is not even loadable if you have more than 24,000 blocks of music saved.Also, you have to set the sound settings on the xbox itself to stereo (dolby surround will not work). If this doesn't bother you than the game should be great. If anyone knows otherwise please let those of us who prefer keeping lots of music saved know what the secret is. NOTE: this has not been a problem on other games such as Project Gotham, Amped, or Tony Hawk."
2,"Good Idea, Bad Game","You all have heard of the popular Midway game, NFL Blitz. An arcade football game with no rules. An all around favorite. This year they have added a new sport to this kind of gaming. NHL Hitz 2002. What better sport than hockey to exagerate the checking and the hits. Even though I don't play hockey I was dying to try this title. I went over to my friends house to try it first, just incase. The intro is very well done and the graphics are the best of the best. The gameplay is ok and I think they tried to over do it. Like a flaming puck is going to hurt anybody. This game is probably only good for partys but not to play with your friends. I would vote this game 2 and a half stars."
5,Great book,"Dipicts the breed for how it was originally created. Sure, things have changed but, this book is a great book for those interested in the dog historically! Great pictures and an over all excellent book!"
1,Do not bother,"You know, people like him have problems. These animals are wonderful pets, amazing with children and loyal and loving to the end. Yes the last personality trait is what causes trouble since they will do whatever will make their owner happy! Those are the people who should be put down!!! Fighting a dog is NO sport!"
1,These are garbage,"I bought these for a new pair of Eastland ""dirty buck"" oxfords that were rubbing on my Achilles tendon. When attempting to remove the backing from the pads in order to install them, first sections of the adhesive came off--stuck to my thumb--and then whole sections of the foam itself tore off from the pad, rendering them completely unusable."
2,heel hugs,"I hate to give a bad review, but these didn't work as well as other heel-hugs I have used in the past. I didn't like that once they were in the shoe you could not easily reposition them, so make sure you get them in right the first time. Also my socks keep catching on them at the heel, so I feel them every step I take. Not happy with this purchase."
1,Doesn't work and absolutely NO SUPPORT!!,A waste of money! It doesn't work. I'm plugging it into a new Dell laptop with Windows 7 and isn't recognized. Their web-site provides zero help with no way to contact them.
2,Not a fan,I'll be honest. I hate this ball. My school has about a dozen of these that get used in an arena style multicourt surface. They're extremely annoying to use if you regularly play with a regular size 5 or a futsal ball.Reasons:*The felt surface makes them glide around the floor like ice hockey pucks.*They're very hard to get any kind of traction with if you play with the soles of your feet.*They don't last. The felt panels are already falling off ALL the balls after ~4 months of use.I've never seen any commercial indoor soccer court use this kind of ball. I manage my own team and have several players who play on a few other teams. None of us have ever seen this kind of ball in use anywhere. It's basically an over sized tennis ball. I seriously hope my school gets tired of replacing these balls all the time and get something else. For the moment I bring my own ball to school just to avoid using them.
2,A sexologist cum poet....I don't think so,"Having always liked limericks, and especially the more uninhibited kind, i bought this book as the title seemed to match that genre. I was, however, quite disappointed with most of them. There are a few good ones but most are just embarrassing. Reading the author's credentials made me realize a probable cause. He is a sexologist with ""30 years of clinical experience"". Hey, we're not makling a patient study here....Anyway, I highly recommend this curious art form, but get something from a writer, and not from someone who, in his effort to approach this juicy subject matter in a direct way, makes you wish he had written around it instead of straight in it."
1,Not hardly his best work!,"As much of a fan as I am as John Coltrane, I must say that I found this cd to be rather pointless in its own right. It sounded like a bunch of musicians who are beginners just beating up on instruments. These recordings sounded so vague. It's like Coltrane was trying to go in a different direction for whatever reason. If anyone out there is a stranger to Mr. Coltrane's music, I wouldn't recommend this cd as the one to become familiar with. At All! ""Love Supreme, My Favorite Things, Giant Steps and Blue Train"" are the one's to seriously become intimate with. They are serious jazz masterpieces! Do not purchase this one. In fact, I'm taking mine's back to the record store and trading it in for something else a little more worthwhile."
1,Metal Machine Music,"Listening to Ascension is like walking backstage during warmups for a junior high band recital. If there's a tune here, I don't hear it. This is pure cacophony; everyone is off playing their own thing. Some call this the ""ultimate in free jazz"". I call it self-indulgent stuff. I'm not the most serious jazz fan in the world, but I do enjoy all periods of Coltrane (the early Prestige albums, the ""popular"" Atlantic albums, AND the ""classic quartet"" Impulse albums). The beauty of Trane was that he was always taking chances. Ascension, however, is an album where Trane falls flat on his face.If you have say, A Love Supreme, and are looking for another good Impulse-era Coltrane album, try Africa/Brass. Ascension is like nothng else in the Coltrane canon, and it's nothing you will want to listen to."
1,"no clothes on this emperor, I'm afraid","The pretension and patronage of some of these reviews is hilarious!! Very funny (truly).Ascension is all noise and little music; it just doesn't work. Trane had something going with A Love Supreme, but he lost it here. Spend your money on something else."
1,Noise!!!!!!!!,"Although the last couple of years I mainly listen to jazz from The phenomenal period of music between the early 1950's and late 1960's, I am continually amazed at the abundance of quality output. The Blue Note re-issues of works by Horace Silver, Lee Morgan, Grant Green, Larry Young, Hank Mobley, Art Blakey and Blue Mitchell to just name a few are true musical expressions of a fine art.But Ascension by Coltrane is noise and certainly does not fit in with the works of the above artists which represented great musical milestones. Only his early stuff can really be classed as music."
5,ALL THE WAY,"I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE DJ.JOE BLOW OR MIX MASTER JOHN DOE, I DON'T CARE IF YOU HAVE EVERY STUDIO GADGET KNOWN TO MAN, MUSIC HAS NEVER GOTTEN FARTHER OUT THAN THIS. BEYOND PLANET ZAPPA LIES A HIDDEN UNIVERSE WHERE ""ASCENSION"" IS THE COMMON LANGUAGE. METAL MACHINE MUSIC WAS A JOKE, A GOOF ON THE RECORD BUYING PUBLIC. ""ASCENSION"" IN ALL OF ITS CHAOS, IS A TRUE WORK OF ART. IN A DARKENED ROOM WITH PROPER VOLUME YOU CAN FEEL YOUR BRAIN ABSORB THE BEAUTIFUL NIGHTMARE THAT IS ""ASCENSION"". YOU MAY FEEL LIKE YOU'VE BEEN TRANSPORTED INTO THE CENTER OF A DALI PAINTING, OR ABDUCTED BY THE UNKNOWN. YEAH, IT'S THAT ODD. IT IS NOTHING LIKE ANY OTHER COLTRANE RECORD, OR ANY RECORD PERIOD. THIS IS A ONE SHOT DEAL. A FREAK SHOW. 78 MINUTES OF PURE ART. AN EXPERIENCE THAT WILL FOREVER CHANGE YOU ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. I KNOW IT DID ME."
3,A fiery album.,"This album is highly energetic and stupendous in its spontaneity. Full of energy and changing direction, constant movements into unforeseen realms, like the turbulent atmosphere of a newly born solar system. This album is a planet not yet cooled."
5,MUST HAVE FOR COLTRANE FANS,"In this set, we are treated to two different versions of Coltrane's piece ""Ascension"". Accompanying him are two trumpet players and four saxophone players; what is created sounds at times like Ornette Coleman's ""Free Jazz"", only much more streamlined and easier to listen to. Each player has a chance to solo, and each solo is exceptional. Coltrane plays with a fury and passion that typfies his work in the sixties. The audio is superb; ""meticulously remastered"" is a phrase that may be overused, but is certainly appropriate here. This album will not dissapoint."
4,Worth the money.,"If you want your Xbox to play DVD's this is the kit for you.Of course, it would have been nice if Bill Gates would have just made Xbox's play DVD's to begin with, but I suppose they are all about making more $$$.The product does work well, so I recommend it."
3,"Well, it works.","Has to have good line of sight to work, just the minimum features. If you're using your XBOX as a media center, this is pretty much your only option and it's a lot better than using the controller."
5,Amazed I could still find one!,"Somehow, after 7 years of service I lost my original XBox remote.(Yes, my Version 1 XBox is still in service, 2 of them, in fact!)I was happy to find a brand new one online @ Amazon & at a ridiculously low price. {The shipping cost more than the brand new remote!}I love my original XBoxes & they continue to be excellent gaming machines and wonderful DVD players. And this remote completes the picture."
1,"Not needed, but ok to have","I bought this remote playback kit here on amazon for $6 plus shipping, and used it for about a week when I figured out that I didn't even need it. I had just got done with a softmod with the UnleashedX dashboard and went to watch a DVD, but the remote wouldn't work, so I just used the controller and later on noticed that the IR sensor wasn't even plugged in(Took it out for the softmod), so instead of buying this, put the money towards a good softmod."
3,Not the best dvd player,"This remote is nice i have had no problems with it. but the xbox doesnt play some dvds very well, they skip or wont load. same goes for the ps2. i had one of those and a lot of my movies would skip in it. the dvds were brand new. if you want a good dvd player buy a dvd player not a video game system. but if you have either systems watch dvds on it if you dont have a dvd player, but its not going to play as well as a actual dvd player."
4,Better than using the controller...,"Hey - I'm happy to shell out the ... for this remote because I'm glad the Xbox doesn't make you use the controller to watch movies! My husband is buying the Xbox, and I'm excited about the DVD feature (getting rid of one extra piece of equipment in the ent. center is always a plus, too!)."
2,IDIOCY! CHEAPSKATE! SCUMBAG!,"OK. X box is great. I love it. DVD is great. I love that too. An X-Box that plays DVDs is really really greatCharging 20 bucks to turn the switch on is foolishness, and outrage. Microsoft should be ashamed of itself. Little do most people know that your X-box, as it is, without the kit, has the ability to play DVDs. The little thing you stick into the controller slot simply activates it. You have just bought a 20 dollar remote and switch-flicker. Congratulations.But I guess the result, however overpriced,is much desired, hence the second star, but if you already have a DVD player handy, you might want to reconsider this purchase"
3,"Xbox (not Xbox 360, they play DVDs on their own)",Perfectly fine product if I didn't have Xbox 360. Dumb move..didnt realize 1) Xbox 360 plays DVDs on its own and 2) this product is for Xbox.
3,Good but not great,"All the points in the other reviews are correct:The quality of DVD play is excellent.The lack of power and eject buttons is annoying.Overall I am very happy with this and it has replaced one componant in my AV system which I like. I programed the Xbox remote into my Sony Multifunction learning remote and the reciever into port 4. I do not have DTS or anything so I cannot speak to anything other than the basic sound, but it is also excellent.If you want the best DVD player you can get, go buy something else.If you want to save space without sacraficing picture quality this is a great buy."
4,It's extra and that's ok.,"I see a lot of reviews here that condem MS for making this controller a seperate add on. The truth is that if you are serious about using the DVD functionality that you would likely buy a remote anyway (even on the PS2). Additionally, there are licenses that need to be paid to the developers of the X-box's dvd playback software. I personally applaud MS for making this add on seperate. If I don't want to watch DVD's on my X-box then I don't have to pay for something I'm not going to use to subsidize those who will.On the usability front, while it isn't perfect, I find the remote ergonomically acceptable and easy to use. It provides easy access to the features you're going to use 99% of the time and access to the other features (zoom etc.) via online menus."
1,DON'T buy this,"This remote is of awful quality; i've been through two of them in the past year. I wouldn't complain so much if it didn't cost $30! It's worth ten, at most. Most people would be better off buying a cheap DVD player, rather than using the xbox."
1,DVDs don't play!,"DVD's which play perfectly well on other cheap players, freeze/skip or don't play when I try to play them on the XBOX. Don't waste your money on this, buy a stand-alone DVD player instead so you won't have the frustration that I've had!"
1,No Power Button and Expensive,Way too expensive and doesn't have a power button. What remote is [this much] and doesn't have a power button? Answer: An Xbox DVD Remote (and remotes from about 20 years ago). There are other things that I do not like about it but this is the most glaring example. You should be able to program the Xbox into your universal remote and the remote receiver should be built in to the system.
1,Poor product. Very disappointed. Now we see why none of the stores carry it.,"This remote control ""kit"" is a big disappointment. May as well just keep using the X-Box controller to access the DVD mode. The remote control ""kit"" doesn't eliminate any of the steps or aggrivation."
4,If you don't already have a DVD player,"Who should buy this? Well this is great IF1. You don't already have a DVD player, or at least don't have one connected to the same TV and sound system your xbox is connected to.That's pretty much it. If you don't have a DVD player this is a very affordable way to get one, if you already own an xbox. It's also good if your xbox is hooked up to a TV that does not have a DVD player or only 1 set of video inputs so there is no place to put a DVD Player. Having it all in one is really great.But, keep in mind the more you use your xbox the shorter it's lifespan will be. This is a gaming system, and the best one out there, but the Xbox DVD kit is really just an alternative to a stand-alone DVD player when a DVD player alone is not available or practical.If you find one for a good price, you might as well pick it up though, you never know when it might come in handy."
1,other systems have this built in,"the ps2 has DVD, and 10 dollar optional remotes. There is a 300 dollar panason DVD gamecube for 300, that has DVD and a remote already. Why does the ""greatest"" system require more money, but still brag about DVD playback?"
1,Cant view the movies,I can see the movie menus but thats as far as i get. I think Ive tried everything.
3,Blah,"The kit is OK I suppose. The controller is pretty hokey, and it bothered me that there was no power button. It is pretty light weight (not in a good way) and hollow. The DVD picture is clear, but what DVD player isn't. I don't have too much to say about it. At least it was cheap. Too bad you need to buy it to play DVD's on XBOX"
4,Easy to use control.,"This is a very basic and simple control, easy to use. But it is necesary to have it in order to watch DVD movies.My XBox is my first DVD movie player, and I think its great, very nice visuals and great audio makes it hard to believe it is a game console machine. Finally a game console where parents rule."
4,"Good Start, hope version 2 is better",Pros:- nice ergonomic control- strong signalCons:- not a UNIVERSAL control- NO POWER button- NO EJECT button
4,This is handy!,"I've enjoyed my XBOX DVD player. It is relatively easy to use, and functional. I have found it more convenient than my original DVD Player.However, there are two down sides.1) The round button at the top that looks like a power button: It isn't. I find myself pressing it at the end of almost every movie, but it is a display button to bring up machine settings like Sound and Segment Repeat.2)There is no volume control, so you have to wrestle with an extra remote. I don't mind, because I already pipe mine through an external stereo system, but if you like to be able to use only one remote, this isn't the DVD Player for you."
3,"Works, but watch out","If you're using a third-party coaxial cable adapter, the copy-protection XBox encodes may cause some difficulties in sound and picture. This will most likely manifest as a cross between a hum and a buzz. It won't happen on all scenes, but those with white backgrounds seem to be effected worse. I upgraded to a Microsoft brand adapter, and it seems to have fixed the problem, but there are still some diagonal lines. I'm not sure where the problem lies.The price of the item may seem a little high, but what you're paying for is the licence to use DVD technology. The reason it's not standard is that Microsoft is already taking a loss on every system they sell. Their hope, of course, is to make up the loss through sales of the games."
3,Better than PS2,"I own both an Xbox and a PS2 and the Xbox controller, as basic looking as it is, is much easier to use than the PS2 DVD controller. I guess there's really not that much to say about a remote except the fact that it is disappointing that you have to purchase a remote if you want to watch DVD's on your Xbox. It's not like Microsoft doesn't have any money."
1,Ridiculous nickel and dime product from MS,"I find it outrageous that Microsoft does not enable DVD playback with the basic game console. I have a PS2 and it doesn't require special enablement or a separate contol. I can simply put a DVD into the console and then I'm able to contol the playback using my game controller. Sure, if MS wants to charge for the remote, that would be fine for those customer that need/want that wireless convenience. However, I think this product is just another annoying anc costly ""gotcha"" from MS.cjk"
2,Not Needed. I DONT LIKE COPS!,"Yeah, it saves space in your room. But it can make your X Box slower. Trust me, i noticed a difference after about 2 months of playing dvds on it. And there started to be more and more ""Error Reading Disc"" messages. It plays dvds, but has made gameplay a little frustrating."
4,Hit or Miss,"I think the root problem here is that not all X-Boxes are built equally. They apparently can have a variety of different DVD drives installed in them at the factory and it's a roll of the dice as to if you got a good one or not.I had a mediocre one. Played games no problem but had skipping, stuttering or outright failure to play some DVD movies that ran just fine on my computer or new DVD player. Some people report you can play DVD-R and CD-RW, some say not.So I dunno -- this makes a nice, cheap DVD player for the kids but shouldn't be looked at as a fully reliable system."
2,NO Power ON or Open/Close Buttons,"It cost too much for a subpar remote and crappy attachment.It should have more features for the price. $20 more and you can buy a cheap dvd player with a remote with these standard features.It has no Power ON or Open/Close Buttons which should be standard and if you go into the console menu as oppose to the dvd menu. You run into the problem going back to using the game controller since you can only use (B) as back and (a) as accept. The remote does use the back feature but not the Accept.If you want a dvd player go buy one or wait until microsoft make a dvd kit with the Power ON, Open/Close Buttons(Eject)and fix the little problem going from the console menu back to the playing the dvd."
4,Xbox DVD Playback Kit,Works great. Brand new in package. Very reliable. If you don't have one for your old Xbox get one! It's worth it. Plays any type of DVD.
3,Xbox remote control--,"Now that the xbox 360 is on the market I guess this is irrelevant but how hard would it have been for microsoft to program the console to be controlled by the game controllers. The remote works fine but I would recommend a Playstation console b/c of this huge flaw in the system. The xbox doesn't play some newer dvd's, don't know why. This product was worth the price but I never would have paid the original cost of $30+. Don't pay more than $10-15 for this product anywhere."
1,DVD Kit Hard to Find,"Would like to get my hands on the x box DVD player kit but can't find one anywhere. And I live right in the middle of Microsoft Country! I'm wondering what the problem is with the supply of this relatively inexpensive device -- if there's bugs in the initial production run or what. As I write this, there are 14 of them for sale from private sellers who are charging from 145% to 333% of the list price. I won't pay that. I don't want to see a DVD so bad that I can't wait until I can buy one for the list price or better yet for less when the market floods and the retailers start whacking prices."
4,Y Not DVD,My DVD palyer gives me a blue screen even after buying the DVD remote control. Buy a cheap DVD player instead of using the X-Box for one.
1,It doesn't make sense,"Why should you have to pay for this just to use a DvD player? The system has a DvD player in it but they decide to make you buy this to be able to use it. What if it's lost? Many people loose remotes. A normal DVD player can be found really cheap now, so why pay (this includes the system and the game) for a same quality player?"
3,This is not a game. It helps organize systems. Buy!,I was asked how much fun this game was and rate this game overall. THis is not a game. It is a remote controller like device that helps organzie the system. I would recommend the product highlyIt did not let me submit my review without ratings so I chose 3 as a game but remember this is not a game. My actual ratings are irrelevant.
3,Decent,"of course I bought this to turn the Xbox into a DVD player. It does that and it does it well. The DVD playing on the Xbox is really nice but regarding this item itself (the remote) its simply OK.The buttons on the remote could have been placed in a more organized and comfortable fashion. its a little confusing.Other than that I'm happy using the DVD on the Xbox, although I dont know if that's due to this item or the Xbox console itself."
4,"Okay, but playstation's is better","Now, I'm not biased or anything, but playstation's remote is much better. It fits more comfortably, has more functions and is smaller. But, seeing as there is no competition for Xbox DVD remotes, this one is a definite best buy. The thing that blew most people's lids about Xbox needs the remote to play DVDs. However, if you do want to watch DVDs on your Xbox, this remote is your only hope. All in all, this remote is a monopoly, but it is worth the money."
2,Limited usefulness...,"The Xbox is an awesome gaming system. It's almost worthless as a DVD player.No remote power switch, no remote eject, no power-down bookmarking, the dongle ties up one controller slot... I could go on, but what's the point?On the plus side the remote is comfortable and easy to use, and you use only one A/V input for your game system and DVD player.You can pick up a low-end DVD player for about the same price as two or three of these, so only use this if you're extremely low on funds, or if your TV is short on inputs."
5,Happy son!,I bought this for my son as he had lost the original in a move. It works perfectly and arrived on time.
5,Great,Received it so quickly I thought it was a mistake. My son uses it all the time to watch movies
5,Works great!,The movie playback kit is pretty awesome. The Xbox plays DVDs significantly better than my DVD player. If you have an Xbox and need a DVD player I would definitely recommend this kit.
3,Old school,"It worked, what more could you ask for? Turned the old x box into a virtual DVD player so the kids would leave me qlone"
2,Well...,"I got it to work once. That was it. Now my Xbox tells me I need the kit. So either the playback kit is messed up, or my Xbox is not reading it. For $7 I'm not shattered though."
5,great,"this is so much better than having to use the controller for the ps2, this is like having a tv remote for your xbox, the only thing i don't like is that you can't turn on or off the xbox with it"
4,Xbox 1 Dvd Playback,"Well my DVD/VCR combo gave up the ghost. It was almost 10 years old anyways. Also my upstairs DVD player went dead on me about the same time. I had bought it used many moons ago when DVD players where still going for $150. I dont really play video games now that im 37. Then it hit me, my old Xbox works as a DVD player and surprisingly i still remembered you needed this. Their was a reason this remote was needed. Microsoft was trying to recoup some money on offering DVD playback in its console. For fear off people not wanting to buy the Xbox because it lacked this feature they came up with this scheme. At the time DVD players where still going for about $125 for a cheap one. The kit at the time was $30, so Microsoft made about a $23 profit on this. Of course it was either that or buying a DVD player for $125. Anyways thankfully you can get this now for under $10. As i dont watch many movies as well it will do a job. Also i do have another Dvd player as well as my main unit."
3,Question,"Does this use a up a controller port making it so you can only have 3 controllers connected? If so, they should make it better. I had a PS2 remote control that would still let a controller pass through. This way you don't need to plug/unplug things to play games or DVDs."
1,Bill Gates can kiss mine....,"This product is yet another example of Microsoft squeezing as much money as possible from the consumer...I mean, come on...Why advertise the X-Box as having a DVD player when you can't even use the player until you buy the remote....Shame on you Bill Gates."
1,What? I thought this was also a DVD player,"I was so dissapointed when I realized i needed a seperate remote to play DVD's! And while im at it, I might as well get a component adapter too, oh but it doesn't include cables! Doh'!"
2,RiP OfF,First off why do you have to pay extra (money) just to watch dvds.At least with PS2 you could use the controller in a pinch. If you really wanted a Controller you could buy the sony one for (less). And to all you people who say the PS2 DVD is bug plaged it is not true. Some people did have problems but that is only the minority. I got my PS2 the first day it came out and no problem. Some of those people may just have pluged the system into the VCR. The DVD encyption auotmatically scrambels it so you can't copy it. This may also happen to XBOX so be careful. (...)
5,You need it!,"YOU need it because I put in a DVD and a screen came out saying""you need the DVD PLAYBACK KIT.EJECT DVD TO CONTINUE."" THATS WHY!"
1,"OK, you can watch DVD's on the XBox...","OK, you can watch DVD's on the XBox. But, did we tell you that you had to buy another gadget to unlock that feature? NO!!! You can slap in a CD, and a nice little onscreen menu pops up that you can use the game controller to use. But, you have to go buy something else if you want to watch a DVD.... Also, it won't scan into a song. I have a CD with some VERY long songs. I want to get to the middle of the song, and not hear the whole thing, but I can't. Also needs an off button very badly."
5,Do NOT buy Substitutes!!!!!!!!!! Buy the original!!!!!!,Buy the original Microsoft XBOX DVD Remote. I bought a substitute from Game Liquidation and after only 10 movies the receiver/transmitter stopped working. I did not get a refund although I returned the product.The original remote is GREAT! No problems so far and I have seen dozens of movies - satisfaction guaranteed.
2,New blade for Oster animal clipper,This blade is worse than the one I was trying to replace. It seems to be extremely dull. It is suppose to be a new blade but I question that claim.
3,JUST OK,THESE CLIPPER BLADES DO NOT SEEM TO BE ANY BETTER THAN THE LAST ONES THAT WERE NOT CRYOGEN. I WILL NOT SPEND THE EXTRA $$ AND JUST BUY THE REGULAR ONES NEXT TIME
3,not the sharpest blade in the box,I bought this to replace my old Oster clipper blade #10. This new blade does not cut as well as the old one did when it was new. I am disappointed with this clipper blade.
5,Great product,I use different sizes of blade but I use size 10 to trim the hard to reach area or matted area and always achieve a good result
5,Oster is the Best,"excellent item. It works very well.Very satidfied. with this item,Top brand.Highly recommend this item.Very powerful motor."
5,great product!,Thanks for this. I have been looking all over for this product! It simply dosen't get better than this...Thanks! It was so easy.
1,blades,Lasted 1 cut. Bought a better clipper. These blades and clipper are worthless. The corded Oster A5 simply does the job on very large standard poodles.
5,Perfect for DS families,"I bought this book for my daughter, also named Emma, when her brother was unexpectedly born with Down syndrome a year ago. The book accuately describes the feelings my husband and I were feeling, and the concerns I'm sure Emma will have when Jake gets older. (She's only 3 now, but already knows there is something different about her best playmate) From the moment we first read it to her, it became her favorite book. She calls it her ""special book"" and asks us to read it to her often. I even have had mothers at church borrow it so they can read it to their children to explain to them what Down syndrome is, and how Jake will be affected.I love this book, and its overall message - that Jake may not be able to do all the things other babies his age are doing at the time, but he will in his own time, and he just might need a little help."
4,"Fun story, great content, but not a total winner with my daughter (she's a tough critic :^)","We bought this story because our 5 year old daughter is a little jealous of the time we spend with our 17 month old daughtter who has DS. I read it to both of them and they really enjoyed it; nice colors, good story, good connection. However, the five year old never asks me to read it to her. Though she doesn't mind if I volunteer to read it, it is just never HER pick. Nice sotry though and good integration of two siblings. Helps the older sibling understand a little more about why their sibling has DS, where it comes from, and other good questions."
5,Actually very easy and clear,"What has thinkers through time had to say about ""social structure""? If you need the answer to this question, this book provides an excellent, clear review of the main ideas. I needed that review so the book was very useful to me. Even if you don't desperately need the answer to the question, the book is still an insightful reading."
1,Where is my stain?,"I couldn't find Varathane stain ANYWHERE in my area and they had the color I wanted. I ordered it on Tuesday and still had not received a shipping notice on Friday! I emailed the seller and was told that it would ship Friday, which to me meant that they either forgot my order or didn't give a hoot when it shipped. I finally got it Wednesday of the following week.The stain is just what I wanted and went on easily. You are supposed to be able to apply an oil-based finish in 8 hours so I gave it 24 hours. When I applied the polyurethane, the stain was coming up with the brush! I had to make sure to brush only with the grain otherwise it would smear the stain across the wood! Now I know why no one carries it!"
2,Disapointed,This book wasn't as interesting as I thought it was going to be. It was very confusing and I had real difficulty relating to any of the characters.
5,"Required Reading for Parents (er, do I have that authority?)","I see the reader review preceding this one states: ""The only reason I do not give this book 5 stars is that the author focuses primarily on child-directed consumerism.""Perhaps said reader didn't notice the TITLE of Susan Linn's book? :(Why CONSUMING KIDS isn't a national bestseller in perpetuity (and required reading for parents), I cannot explain, other than to suggest that Mattel and Disney have formed a conspiracy against it. Kudos to Susan Linn."
5,Perfect,"This was great, worked perfectly for weighing out ingredients and herbs. I noticed a lot of people were saying it wouldn't calaborate and I think you should pay attention to the directions. It is VERY sensitive, just breathing on it makes it go crazy so no windy areas."
3,Triton T2,"This is fine for grams, ounces, but do not buy for gems or diamonds as it does not measure carrots."
2,WARNING - Ounces are calculated wrong!,"This scale is very accurate for grams. I have a calibrated 100g weight, and it is a perfect ""100.0"". However, when switching to ounces, the computer calculates the wrong value! Rather than 3.53 ounces for 100 grams (which is the correct rating), it comes back with 3.2! In my case, we were using this scale for a Cub Scouts Pinewood Derby where our car had to be no more than 5.0 ounces. We made it dead on 5.0 on the scale, but when we went to weigh in we were half an ounce to heavy! After a lot of confusion, we finally proved the scale was amazingly accurate in grams, but totally wrong in ounces! We had to do some major last second surgery and it likely will cost us the race.So, if you want to measure in grams (you can easily use google to convert ounces to grams) - this scale is a fantastic value. But don't rely on the ounces conversion!"
2,REVIEW,THIS SCALE IS NICE HAS NICE TRAY THAT COMES WITH IT ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE IS THAT EVERYTIME I WANT TO WEIGHT SOMETHING ON THE SCALE I HAVE TO RECALIBRATE (200 GRAMS) IT EVVVERRRYYYYYYTIME -_- I REALLY DONT LIKE THAT ABOUT IT BUT I MEAN ITS NICE ITS KOOL IT WEIGHTS WELL AFTER I RECALIBRATE IT I WOULD RECOMEND IT TO ANYBODY THAT NEEDS A GREAT SCALE JUST I HOPE YOU DONT HAVE SAME PROBLEM AS ME.
2,Stupid shutoff,"Great scale, if you don't mind that it's going to decide to shut off after awhile no matter what you do. Frustrating! I can see (even value) a scale that shuts off WHEN INACTIVE, but this piece of crap does it NO MATTER WHAT."
5,just what we needed,I BOUGHT THIS SCALE TO WEIGHT COINS AND JEWELRY AND AS A BONUS IT WEIGHS OTHER THINGS TOO. IT IS PORTABLE AND EASY TO USE. FITS RIGHT IN THE BRIEF CASE AND CAN BE TAKEN ANY WHERE GREAT ITEM
2,Doesn't work correctly.,"This item was delivered fast and contained all the parts, but at the same time I was not even able to calibrate it. While weighting the same item several times, weight is always different. I had to purchase another scales at the store."
4,Very hand for loose teas!,"I love tea and prefer to use loose teas. However, determining how much tea to use per cup can be challenging since some teas are very fine and some are very course. Using a tea scale (or jeweler's scale) is very helpful since tea is measured at 2.5 grams per 6 oz. cup. This of course can be adjusted to taste, but at least you have a starting place.The Triton is very handy, inexpensive and could also be used for measuring gold so you could check to see if you're being ripped off. I'm very happy with this purchase."
2,"Good graphics, but not as good of gameplay as expected","I am so glad I played this game before I decided to buy it. I love the movie, but this game I cannot say the same. The graphics are nice and all, but the gameplay is different. The levels are a bit difficult when the guys can only be knocked out for like a minute. This seems more of a game for someone young as it does not really have much for violence. I was expecting so much more, but was disappointed. I would almost rather play the games that came on the DVD for the movie than this. Rent the game, borrow it, or otherwise play it before you buy it!"
2,A True Dissapointment!!,"I bought this game thinking it would be fun and enjoyable, like the movie. It certaintly wasn't. The graphics aren't any good, The controls are horrible and the missions are pointless. I felt this game would be based on the movie but i was wrong. (...)"
1,Way below par for true game lovers,I am glad that I rented this game before purchasing it because it was a huge letdown! The graphics were so bad it looks as if a class of Elementary school kids created it. Rated for teens is a joke...I don't know any teens that would be entertained by this for one second! Really bad choice for any avid x-box gamer!!
4,"A fun, lighthearted game","This one is a nice lighthearted game for when you don't want to run around killing everything :). Instead, it's more of a puzzle/adventure oriented game, and should be entertaining for all ages. I'd probably recommend waiting to see how the reviews for this title are instead of preordering however, since the movies released so far indicate that the gameplay may be overly simplistic."
4,Shrek for the XBox,"I bought this game for my 5 year old nephew. He plays it nearly everyday since Christmas (today is 4-1-02, and this is not an April Fool's). For me, I wouldn't buy it, but for any kid I would. The amount of time they put into the graphics for this game must be staggering. Every new level is just beautiful . . . I mean like amazing. . textures, sheens. TDK Interactive doesn't get enough credit for this gem."
2,Not for Kids,"I bought this thinking that my children could play and enjoy it. That is not the case. This game is complicated and very hard to master yet it is clear that it was originally meant for children.For one, you can't kill any enemy characters. You can just stun them and after a few seconds they get back up. Oh, Shrek cannot die either. Gameplay is based on specific missions that are time based. For instance one mission is to fart on a dancing cow before the sun goes down.The only positive thing that I can say is that the graphics are incredible.Bottom line, rent don't buy."
1,People Who Say This Game Is Good Are CRAZY!,"This game is horrible, boring, disgusting, monotonous, repetitive, and generally unlikable. That should be enough to convince you that this game stinks! It even has a button so you can belch and another so you can pass gas. That was a little too disgusting for my taste. Even OddWorld does that, but it doesn't put any emphasis on it like this game does. Don't rent, don't buy, don't even consider it. Just pick up Shrek 2 and leave Shrek 1 alone!"
1,Two Thumbs Down for Shrek the game.,"Hello Shrek Fans. I won't lie, the Shrek game was terrible. I loved the movie, I know every line, but the game hardly lived up to the movie's level of greatness. It had a boring and stupid concept and characters who didn't appear in the movie such as Merlin and Humpty Dumpty were in the game for some weird reason. It was the first game I received for the Xbox and I find myself playing my brother's games until a substitute for such an awful game can be found. The movie was fab, the game was drab. Two thumbs down for Shrek the game. Thanks for reading and I hope this helped you make a decision."
2,Could have been better,"This game has great graphics, wonderful sounds and music, and awful game play. The puzzles are boring and hard. You would have thought that they would have put better puzzles in. The one puzzle that comes to mind is a puzzle where you have to turn off the work whistes. Now this seems like an easy task, but you have the factory workers turning them back on. Now the factory whistels are very spread out and once you get one turned off and get to the next they have already fixed the one you tunred off. If you want an adventure game that is great try Odd world for the xbox. 10 times better than this one"
1,This one convinced me to sell my XBox!,"I don't know how a game manages to be dull and hard at the same time, but SHREK has done it. After playing for about fifteen minutes, I found myself longing...no, yearning to switch to my Zelda games on my Nintendo 64. As a matter of fact, after only a few hours of playing on the XBox, my husband and I decided to sell it and wait for a Nintendo GameCube instead. They've always had the best games--Zelda, Gauntlet, Turok--and I suspect they always will. So if you like dull, repetitive games that involve farting on your enemies and no brain power or dexterity skill, SHREK is the game for you!"
3,Drivel for sedating your child.,"Name one movie license that has produced a high-quality videogame? There aren't any. By their very nature, such games pander to the lowest common denominator - gameplay will be dumbed down so that it can be played by the kids who got the Shrek toy with their happy meal. If you still think fart jokes are funny, and enjoy running around a lot - you might like it. Otherwise: rent the movie, avoid the game."
1,This game is REALY STUPID,"People, this game has no meaning, you go around farting and burping. Sure its funny at first but i wouldent waste your money on it."
1,Movie- 10! Game- 0!,"No matter what you do, do not buy this game. If you're willing to spend $50 on this game, send the money my way. I can think of a lot more uses for it. Like throw it in a blender, for instance.The game has fantastic graphics, don't get me wrong, but there is no gameplay at all, and absolutely NO replay value whatsoever. Once you're done, you wish you had borrowed it from a friend. (Borrowed cuz its not even worth the $5-$6 to rent)Just buy the movie (and perhaps the soundtrack) and be satisfied."
1,A horrible follow-up to a great movie,"I was really excited when I bought this game. I thought it was going to be a cool game based on the movie where you had to fight the dragon and save the princess, like Super Mario Bros. But it is a huge dissapointment. It seems as if no one of any age group can enjoy it. It's too complicated for a child to understand and master, and the mission are so stupid and childish for an adult to enjoy. The graphics are really good though. When Shrek walks through a field of flowers, he actually walks through it, unlike the other systems where he would walk on top of it. It would be wise to rent this game and save your money for Halo or a better game."
3,Such a disappointment!,"I bought this game thinking that it would fun and entertaining. I was definitely mistaken. It's the same thing over, and over, and over again. No variety. Doing the same thing once or twice is okay, but 5 times is just too many. I wish I had rented it first."
3,ok but dosent work on the xbox 360,well i have had this game for a while then i got the new xbox 360 and shrek does not work on it. Im very upset about that because its such a fun game and it is very good so i ordered a game off this and i ordered it 6 days ago and hasnt came yet im not sure if it will work on the xbox 360 but i hope it does. But it is taking a while to come and might not work because some of my old games off the xbox do work on the 360.
4,Not so good!,Just plain boring and hard to play! Like many of the off beat xbox games Shreck is a waste of money!Nice thought but don't spend much on it as it's not worth the time playing let alone hard earned cash!
3,A mediocre game,"This game is entertaining, but the controls are a bit hard to use.The game centers around Shrek's requirements to help people with tasks. These tasks are things like collect all of Mary's lambs and get them back in their coral, or go around and break all of the work whistles at a factory.There are people that try to stop your do gooding, so you have to smack them around a bit.While there is some violence in the tasks, it's fairly minimal and no character really gets hurt. There is no blood or graphic violence, just shrek kicking or punching the chars and they get right back up.I found the controls to be a bit hard, because there is no option to see things through shrek's eyes. You are always viewing from above and the view point rotates some sometimes you are viewing from above and behind and sometimes you are from the side or front, which can make it a bit hard to do what you want.Overall the game is entertaining and most kids will like it."
2,2 stars for movie,"1 star for the game, what a boring, unfunny, game. I can't complain about the controls(but I can about the controller), Shrek is just bad."
2,SHREK GAME: THE MOVIE WAS BETTER,"I have this game(sadly). Beleive me, the movie is 10 times better. The game doesn't even feature ""Donkey"", come on. But for real, the objectives are too hard for a kiddy game like this and well, just not that fun. Not an I want it, I want it gift: definetely a: ""Oh, thanks Grandma"" kind of thing"
4,This book almost has it right . . . .,"If only it were organized just a tad differently. Finding a wine journal to keep at home and record our favorite wines as we encounter them is tough. There's just not much out there that is big enough to keep all my info in. Most, it seems are designed to schlep back and forth to restaurants or wineries. This size of this book relative to a wine label is okay, maybe a bit on the small size, but still workable. I thought the spiral binding was appropriate for a book with pages that will force it to get bigger because of added labels. The biggest drawback however, is the page layout. There are several pages to list your favorite wines, however the place to paste the corresponding label is on the back of the page AND there is only one place to paste a label for every 3 or 4 wines listed. Ultimately I ended up returning the book."
5,"This novel is rich in setting, characterization, and plot.","This is a riveting novel that kept me turning the pages to see what would happen next! The author shows depth of understanding of mental illness as she paints a picture of Belle in her search for a fictional character. Her characterizations of Belle's associates are likewise rounded and realistic. In addition, her descriptions of New Orleans will make anyone familiar with the French Quarter feel as if he or she were right in the middle of the action. I was fascinated with the wise use of detail that made scenes come alive. What a good read!"
3,Magellan Symphony for Misanthrope,"Magellan are a band I have stumbled upon only recently.The bring back memories of my younger days of listening to Yes,Genesis,Kansas of progressive bands of the 70's. If you enjoy complex arrangements with lots of interesting key changes then you will enjoy Magellan.This album seems to just miss it somewhere.I think the vocals are a little disappointing,but on the whole I still enjoy their style.Maybe it just lacks a bit of emotion.If you enjoy progressive rock giver this a listen and check out their other stuff.They seem very involved with lots of different artists producing.I am looking forward to hearing more of their material. I am waiting for their latest album as I write this."
1,"I'm sorry, but this album and band are terrible.","I've never heard such well thought out lyrics in my life.""at the end of the world the big man came,you promised last time you wouldn't make it rain,so he picked up the earth like a basketball,and threw it in the air just to watch it fall""Oh yeah. They're great."
1,Holiday On The Buses,"Bewarned these DVDs are extremely poor, bad quality.I purchased On The Buses Movies: On The Buses, Holiday on the buses, Mutany on the buses,They look as if they have been taken off very bad warn out home video tape recorded off TV. Some parts of the DVD were so bad I could not see what was happeningDONT WAST YOUR MONEY as I found them anoying to watch due to quality issuesSupplier did provide well packaged product on time, no isue with seller just the DVDs"
3,Fierce limitations,"3 1/2Though essentially variations on a theme...what a warped theme it is, and with duo attacks this intense yet subtly effective, even conservatives would do well to take notes. Even if some of Coltrane's latest can sound off-putting for abrasive jaggedness, IS relinquished much of the conscious squelching to peel back layers of intense devotion on higher melodic understandings."
1,"If you like this, I've got a Yoko Ono album to sell you.","Coltrane's avante garde masterpiece was ""A Love Supreme"". This session goes over the edge and makes unreasonable demands on the ear. But don't take my word for it. Listen to the samples."
5,Wonderful for the person who loves to do embroidery,"Color and black and white photos in this large format book illustrate embroidery from all corners of the globe. The first half of the book describes the practice of embroidery in many lands, the second half deals with stitches and techniques (177 entries, not counting stitch variations.). Embroidery is not merely a pastime, but an art."
4,parallels to current recession,"The current recession has been driven in no small part by mortgage defaults. With this in mind, the book from 1969 takes on a twist when reading it nowadays. It looks at the difficulties poor people encounter in finding affordable housing. One solution, mooted by the book, is for new homes. All very commendable. After all, who advocates homelessness?Yet from today's perspective, it was reasons like this, for increasing home ownership amongst all segments of society, that helps propel housing prices to unnatural heights. From which they have fallen, with much fallout."
4,Aladdin 24-ounce lunch bowl,I had purchase the lunch bowl for trasporting meals for my swimmer. Holds the temp. of food for at least 3 hrs. The only down side is that is hard to open after placing hot food. My 12 years old girl always need help of someone stronger to breake the seal. The size is perfect. Overall I'm very pleased with the product. I own two of them. Would love to see that size in stainless steel.
2,not sure yet,"Gave it two stars for now as I am sure there is more than one way to skin this cat. Just dumping hot food in, it does not keep warm. I will try heating thermos as well. I do have a question about the instructions though. It says remove lid and STOPPER when heating, what STOPPER?"
1,completely dissatisfied,"I would return this but the website, [...], does not have a link specifically about returns and for the $14.06 I spent, it is not worth the time and effort to call or write them. It's going in the TRASH. I used this 3 times, hoping that for ONCE it would keep my lunch warm. The first two times was a chowder & stew. I followed all directions. Both were luke warm in 2.5 hrs. The last time I used was a pasta dish. I ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT get the cover off. By the time I got home, my husband couldn't get it off either. It was hermetically sealed. I am completely dissatisfied with this product."
1,Did not keep my food hot,Our Aladdin did not keep food hot for 4 hours. It was so useless we gave it away to Goodwill.
2,could be much better,"Cons:1) the lid is wide, so it's not easy to get a grip to open2) food has to be put really hot (with warmed container, probably) to stay warm for a long time. Most often, my food was practically cold already after 3-4 hours.3) the internal container is hard to take it out (it get's stuck). I'd prefer to not have the internal container, because in the end you will want to wash both the external and the internal ones anyway."
1,Don't buy this !,"I was really looking forward to using this item to carry my lunch to work.However, after two tries could not remove the cover ! Just a waste of money.There is no way to grip the top to turn it. Had to get a fellow employee ofsubstantial size with rubber gloves on to open it for me. I wound up throwing itaway as I no longer had the paperwork. Not a pleasant experience !"
1,Horrible product,Kind of keeps food warm. The lid is a huge issue. I bought this for my children and they cannot get the lid off without help. Half the time their teaches cannot get the lid off either. The gasket is hard to keep at the top of the threads and it sometimes gets wound up when the lid is screwed on. The threads are difficult to line up so the lid does not want to screw on well. My kids threw these in the trash with glee!
1,Defective,"Thought this would be perfect for hot soups....First of all it was advertised to have an attached spoon and it did not.Then the divided insert would get stuck and I couldn't remove it. Also, did not keep the food hot. I complained to the shipper and they said to just throw it away and I'd get a credit."
2,Not That Great,"I bought this at my local krogers two years ago maybe three don't remember, and its OK. I don't like it that much as far as keeping food hot. I do however like it convenient Size for meals, But I'am going to be replacing it here soon especially since its winter and I like my soup at least warm by lunch time at work. I have used for food during summer,spring and fall that's warm or hot But it doesn't stay that way,Pros Nice Idea, Nice size and decent storage.Cons, Leaks, flimsy o-ring, and Doesn't keep food warm or hot for very long."
1,waste of money,"Did I miss something? Is there a special way of operating this thing? It says, it's a thermos, so hot stuff in, and it should come out at least warm. Well, it's more like: Put hot stuff in and an hour later it is cold. Hm."
5,Aladdin Bowl,I really like this bowl! One of the few I've found that you can actually use in a Microwave to cook oatmeal without making a mess (just don't try to cook too much at one time(.
2,"nice for transport, but not temperature control","I still use this as something to pack food in, but I don't expect it to keep food warm or cool. I kept it in the freezer overnight to pack fruit or cheese/meat in, hoping it would keep it cool. No, not really. Same with hot food, I heated it first with water from a tea kettle, then put hot food in, and it didn't seem to keep it any warmer than just a regular non insulated container. But it's fine for transport."
1,can't close lid - bad design,I wouldn't waste money on this product. Lid doesn't close properly at all no matter how to try. It is very bad.
1,I hate it when I'm disappointed.,"Today was the first time I tried my new hot lunch bowl. I asked for one for Christmas so I could bring hot soup and leftovers to work for lunch - yum. Well, it didn't come with instructions but I figured I'd put some really hot water in the bowl to heat it up while the soup is warming up in the microwave. I put the hot soup in the thermos, put the thermos - along with the crackers, fruit, etc. in my insulated lunch tote and off to work I went. Well, lunch time came around and I got out my soup, crackers and spoon and couldn't wait to have my nice, hot (I would have settled for warm) soup. Boy, was I disappointed. Ice cold! What a bummer! Even my insullated Thermos lunch tote couldn't keep it warm. Now the problem is, when my grandchildren ask me how I like my hot lunch thermos, am I going to have to lie to them and tell them it's great? I don't want to break their little hearts. I don't give up easily so I am willing to give it another try.... we'll see what happens."
3,adaddin micro lunch bowl,This micro lunch bowl does not stay hot long. It only stays hot for about 2.5 hrs. The lid is hard to screw on straight. It is also hard to screw off. You have to watch the o ring to make sure it does not come off and get cought up in the threads when screwing it on.The good thing about it is that is does not leek if the o ring stays in place. It is dishwasher safe. It is also micro waveable. You do not have food running down the side of the container when you put the lid on.
1,aladdin thermos,"Nice size but this product is awful, does not keep food warm at all! Lid is hard to open. Do not buy! Waste of money!"
3,Something to buy later,"I am buying the Xbox and all the must-have accessories for my boyfriend this Christmas. Memory space is definatly important, but since the Xbox has its own hard drive, I don't really rank a memory card as an essential beginners accessory. This is something made more for people who have had the game system for a while and run out of hard drive space (unlikely to happen for a LONG time!) or those who are experienced players and want to share games with their friends."
3,"Convenient, but not crucial.","Absolutely essential if you need to move your save games, player profiles and controller setups to another Xbox, which happens more often then other user reviews would have you believe. It's especially helpful for games like Timesplitters 2, where levels and characters are unlocked that a friend may not have available yet.It's also nice insurance if the Xbox's hard drive fails, and don't kid yourself folks, they can fail just like any other hard drive-- A coworker's recently deceased, barely out-of-warranty Xbox is testement to that fact. It may be rare, but it's not unheard of. If that sort of thing worries you, then a memory card should be on your shopping list."
3,Great for friends,"I recently purchased the Xbox memory unit at my local game store and i was disappointed at the capacity, you can fit a halo saved game but not much else. i guess it would be good to take files to friends houses, but not for backing up my saved games"
4,"to buy, or not to buy?","the x box has a built in hard drive for mega tons of storage. the only time you need it is if you go over to a friends house that has the same system and same game to use your own file to play the game. so dont buy it if you dont have any friends that have x box and the same games. the memory card works perfect, i never had troubles with it but if you do have friends who have the same stuff you might want to reconsidder!!"
4,Do we really need a review for this?,"Yes...just as everyone else stated...only reason to buy one is for data transfer, or backup. Reviews for this type of item are funny. Your either going to buy it or your not. If you dont know what the purpose of this item is, then you should just sell your xbox and buy a Tonka Truck, because your an idiot. And as for the 8-Gig hard drive...I decided to install one of my old computer hard drives...so now my xbox has a 40 Gig, and I will be upgrading again to 100 Gig...yeah, most people wont need over 8, but I have my reasons >:)"
4,Save,"8 Megs might not seem like a lot, but i was able to fit all my Grand Theft Auto 3+ Vice City , Thief, Max Payne, Medal of Honour, Ghost Recon,Fifa 2004 and Euro 2004 games no prob. The reason i did this was that my x box laser for some reason stopped picking up the games on time, resulting in many games cutting off and a ""disc is dirty or damaged"" message. I couldnt bear playing GTA.VC for weeks to get where i was so i bought the card, booted my saved games then traded my x box in. When I got the new box, the games transferred without fail, i was very satisfied. So if any of you all are experiencing problems like above and your x box is still under warranty, you might want to try that."
3,Unnecessary,"Though this device will likely work great, you don't need it. You can save your games to the XBOX hard drive; XBOX is the only next-gen console which does not require a memory card. So, unless you plan to run back and forth between XBOXes, skip this one for now."
3,"Not neccessary, but useful if you have HALO","First, let me start by saying that if you're going to buy a memory unit, get a cheaper third party one. They're licensed by Microsoft and will save you (money).Next, if you're used to the Playstation and GameCube style of saving games on your memory card, this is not neccessary for the XBOX. You can use the hard drive. But, having said that, know that you will need the Memory Unit if you want to take saved files to a friends house.However, the best reason that I've found to have one of these is because of the game HALO. If you have progressed in a level, but have not finished it and you decide to show someone the beginning of the same level, you will erase all of your progress.With the memory card, you can save your progress on it and demo whatever you want without fear of losing it all. Some other games may have the same problems, so for these reasons, the memory unit is a smart buy."
3,You don't need this you know !,The Hard drive that comes with the xbox is all you actually need. The only reason to get the memory is if you want to backup your saves or if you want to use your Xbox saves on someone elses Xbox.
3,With the X360 not backward-compatible...,"I never really had a use for this, other than a portable save holder."
2,WHY?,"There's really no reason to buy a mu unless you're going to someone's house. It'd be smarter to just get a link cable and bring your XBox. Then, you don't just get your own saved games, but you get your own screen to play them on. And since the XBox has a 10 gig hard drive, thats about... a lot of memory units! Don't worry about running out of space. Has anyone ever used enough blocks so when it tells you how much memory you have left it shows 49,999 or less free blocks? I know I haven't. The XBox proves that its better than PS2 and GC with extra features like the hard drive, and if you're not going to use them, then why didn't you get a PS2 or GC instead of the XBox?(besides Halo) I gave it a two because if you've got cash to blow, then you could get one just to say you have it."
3,Xbox memory card is it compatible with Xbox 360,is the xbox memory card compatible with the 360? are the other memory cards backward compatible aswell?
2,Not the basics for learning the physical aspects of Tai Chi.,I thought this was a instructional tape on beginning Tai Chi to achieve personal harmony. It was a tape about the origin of Tai Chi. I will be sending it back.
5,PASTOR HSI BIOGRAPHY,PASTOR HSI WAS A GREAT BIOGRAPHY AND THE FIRST CHAPTER GRABS YOU WITH THE CLEVER LAST PARAGRAPH! GOTTA READ! LOVED IT AND LOVE SEEING GOD'S FINGERPRINTS IN HIS PEOPLE.
2,POS,"I don't know why, but Oster has let me down big time. None of the blades I get from them seem reliable. They quickly break, but even more then that, they slip off track, the screws never stay tight, and they're never aligned, so they never cut (period), even when sharpened. :( Andis is more reliable."
4,Perfect,"I am known for my salsa recipes and this one takes me to new ideas...wish it was bigger, but at least t gives me inspiration to create more! Nice book. Great color and explanation of everything....pictures!"
1,no show,Ordered this for my son-in-law for Christmas. Never came. I was very disappointed. Can't rate what you don't see.
2,Serious Challenge,"It's a bad omen when it takes you over an hour to put 20 edge pieces together (half of those have writing on them), the edges of the photo on the box don't exactly match the puzzle, AND you find FIVE *different* corners."
1,this company sucks,I bought a hoody from this company and they sent the wrong product to me and expect me to pay the shipping back on it.. I dont understand why they can not send a ups call tag to pick up an item they sent incorrectly.. PLS if you get a recomendation on ANY product from this company DO NOT BUY! they Dont stand by thier product the quality is awful and they expect you to pay the shipping back.. I have asked and asked if they can send a call tag and they will not. I am very dissapointed.. DO NOT buy from this company..Low quality and awful customer service.
4,Movie fine cover imperfect.,Service was great and the movie came in plenty of time before Christmas. The only problem is the cover of the DVD is out of registration; meaning it is out of focus and looks wierd.
2,Fullscreen Go Home!,"Why can't Disney get it right? I realize this is a not-so special comedy. But wouldn't it be nice to have some bonus features. Perhaps a couple of interviews. Maybe a trailer. How about the film in it's proper ration? Not the full screen mess they give us. Oh well, maybe the next release (if there's to be one)."
1,Do Not Buy,"I thought I would smooth out long trips with the kids by purchasing an inexpensive monitor to go with my Pioneer DVD head unit (AVH-P4200DVD. The Pyle monitor did not turn on at all. The LED ""dome lights"" turned on but I could not get the monitor to turn on under no circumstance. I used a digital multimeter and ensured that there was clean 12v power and a solid ground...both were fine. I was about to open the casing to see if there was a failed solder or something of the likes but decided against breaking the paper seals that void the warranty and opted to just return it for a full refund. Pyle (and Boss for that matter) make crappy car audio but I assumed the song would be different dealing with their video line. Wrong! Save up and buy another flip down or a headrest unit that isnt Pyle or Boss."
2,My opinion of the X-box controller,"I am not going to tell anyone that they are stupid if they like the X-box controller. Nor am I going to say something like: ""The Gamecube controller is better, thats just a fact!""I am just going to tell you why you may not like the X-box controller, and why you may prefer the Gamecube controller:First of all(and above all), in my opinion, it is too big. But I think my hands are kind of small(and as you all know, the Gamecube controllr is smaller).Second of all(and lastly): I think the buttons are kind of too close together(my thumbs might be rather big, but I don't think so). Were as with the gamecube controller, to me, they are placed quite wisely.Well, there you have it, my opinion."
1,worse piece of junk ever,"nothing against the seller, but the product is the worst piece of junk ever. i got nothing like what the picture showed. make sure u know what your getting the next time.the control sticks get stuck everytime you use them. product sucks! that's what happened when you buy something made in china!."
3,X_box controller,"This is an OK controller... but bad for such a sweeeeee system. I think Microsoft could have done better! The good thing about is that nothing is hard to get to-However, whats up with the huge logo in the center!...-. The bad things about it are that it is VERY uncomfortable to handle (for me)and it looks, sounds, and feels ""cheep, cheep, cheep"". Don't get me wrong the X-box rocks, but the controler is...well, if you buy it you will see.Note: The X-box controler-S is much better."
2,Too big for small hands...,"I bought the Buffy game for my wife and this controller is too big for her hands. I bought the S controller and she loves it. I think the smaller one is more comfortable too. If you're buying extra controllers for kids, don't get this one - get the S controller instead."
1,FREAKEN HUGE!,"It's too big, The button layout [stinks], and it looks really stupid. Better luck next time Micro$oft."
4,Best Controller That Ships With a Console,"Being a man with average sized hands, I do appreciate the size of the Xbox controller. It's actually made for adults to use! I've never found PS or Nintendo controllers comfortable -- they're simply too small and make my poor, average-sized hands cramp up. I love it.Xbox is certainly geared toward adults, and it's appropriate that the controller that ships with it is designed for adults to use. But if you have hands too small for the Xbox controller or have a child who has difficulty using it, I'm sure some ambitious third party will develope a smaller-sized control in due time."
3,Good... but not the best,"When I first got my XBOX my mom was nagging me not to set it up until my dad gets home (he's a doctor so he works long hours) so I took out the controller and held it. I thought it was big, clunky, and unattractive but very confortable. It is very similar to the Dreamcast controller except that it has two extra buttons and an extra analog stick (joystick type thing...not flat). When I got my first game, HALO (THE ABSOLUTE BEST XBOX GAME OUT!) I thought the controlles were somewhat annoyning because the buttons were too close together (the flashlight button was right next to the grenade button-an accidentent can blow the %^*! out of you!) but I got used to it quickly.Even if the controller isn't the best, you should still get XBOX, it;s well worth your $."
2,Kind of like restaurant pie.,"A good controller should just be an extension of your hand, usable with no concious thought. This thing is a joke. Notice that everybody who likes it says ""just spend some time with it, you'll get used to it."" How can you claim something is ergonomic if you have to get used to it? The control layout is horrible... awkward at best and virtually unusable at worst. Sure, you could get used to it, just like people learn to pick things up with a metal hook after they have their arm amputated. It is a shame that somebody thought this was a good layout for a controller, because the individual parts actually seem quite nice. The triggers feel good, the thumb joysticks feel good, the d-pad is alright, and the buttons, while the worst on the current console scene, are passable. Unfortuately, this is one case where the whole is much, much less than the sum of its parts."
1,What happened?,"I wnet to a Toys r' us by me and i saw the X-box there so i tried out the controller. I literally started laughing. I began thinking ""how could they make a controller this bad after 100's of hours of testing""? First of all the joy stick is too far down making it hard for people with larger hands to play. And if you have small hands the handles are huge making your hands feel as if they are defective. The buttons are so close to each other its hard to hit them without accidently hitting another one. My personal opinion and most others is that Microsoft should never have entered the gaming industry. Im not so sure they know what ergonomics is or what the differences between computer games and console games are. If you want a specialized computer that only plays certain PC games go ahead and pick up an XBOX, but if your a console gamer head on over to GameCube or even PS2..... avoid Dreamcast that failed."
1,Back to the drawing board.,"First the good. The analog triggers are great. They are well positioned and feel very good. Uh, well that's pretty much it for the good. On to the bad. The sticks aren't all that tight which can cause you to easily press them too far and for some games (especially sports games) they don't make movement feel realistic. The D-pad is good for using diagonals but not so good for ^,v,<, and >. The face buttons are angled differently than PS/snes pads which takes some getting used to and the black and white buttons are useless in most games becuase of their position. The start button is a pain to reach because the second stick is in the way which can cause dire seconds to run off the clock in sports games etc. The controller is broad, which is good but the handles are fat which is not good. Unless you have huge hands or like to waste money I'd suggest getting a 3rd party pad, they may not function quite as well but you'd be better off with a pad that is comfortable."
2,It makes NBA stars smaller in comparison,"Sure, the Xbox is tight, but did it really need a controller that could double as a coffee table? I dunno, maybe microsoft is trying to sell it's console to the big and tall people out who have hands, large hands. I'm almost certain now they dont want kids playing this machine. Those little tykes are gonna have to dance on it if they want to reach all the buttons. But that's not my problem, my problem is that my hands are the size of a kid's! Did microsoft ever consider that there are small people out there, or people that want a comfortable controller? My friend is 6'6"" and he was also pondering why they had such a huge controller. I was very displeased, but I'm still getting an xbox. But the controller made me seriously consider if I should purcahse an xbox or not. And (dollar amount) seems a little pricey for it. So make you sure you test drive the controller first before making any decisions."
1,It's way too big,"I just got X-Box recently. I bought a refurbished system that came with this larger size controller. Fortunately I had also bought an extra smaller controller with it. This one is just way too big. The buttons are difficult to reach and I had to keep looking down at the controller to see which one to press.I can't imagine anyone other than Paul Bunyon being able to use this. If you have very large hands then I suppose I could recommend this but for the average person or someone with small hands like myself, use the S controller."
4,Broke It,I have broken two of these controllers playing Madden NFL 2002 and 2003. All in a matter of a few days I broke two of these controllers. It feels great but the durability is ery low. Buttons stop responding and the controllers chip starts pushing buttons for you. Its crazy!
3,NOT good for big hands!,"I had heard that the standard XBOX controller was good for people with big hands, because it is large. I have big hands, and I want a controller that fits my rather large hands. I hate the GC controller 'cause it is so small, it hurts my hands.Do not be fooled. The XBOX controller is horrible if you have big hands. The problem isn't the size, it's the buttons. The buttons are so small and close together that I can't press just one at one time. It is horrible. I can't even play any games. I finally worked it out by buying a third party controller. I recommend that anyone with big hands do this."
3,Too big???,"Ok, we all seem to say that the controller is too big, even for the guy who is six feet tall.So I am gonna remind you that this is not the end of the world! MadCaztz makes sweet controllers that are 90% of the time better and will hopefully be smaller and will fit our hands.So I am telling you keep your standard controller and make your friend use it when you play(This will give you a better chance of beating him) and you take the(smaller)Madcatz controller...Now I cannot be sure that that MadCatz one will be smaller but hey I doubt they can make it worse than the one Microsoft is giving us. dang, Why is there no 2.5 rating........"
1,The Big Behemoth,"The X-Box controller is possibly the worst controller I've ever gotten my hands on. After playing with the Gamecube controller, and then playing with this giant, I decided that the Gamecube has definetly won this fight. First of all, the thing is way to big, considering I am fairly tall and big, I still find it hard to get a good grip. Talking about grip, the controller has none. The buttons are too smoothe and the analog stick has no type of grip like the Gamecube. I don't know why Microsoft made the controller so big, considering Japanese people have smaller hands. Also, it is so similar to the Dreamcast controller, I'm surprised Sega isn't sueing them. As you can tell, I'm not to fond of this controller and have not affectionately dubbed it the Behemuth or the dinner plate with two sausages."
4,Isnt THAT bad,"Only if you have tiny little hands, then you probably wont like it, but most people can get used to if it they give it a chance. Only thing wrong with it is the XYAB buttons, they are not arranged good (but the controller s they are) cuz if you are going for Y, somethins u will hit the clear/white button"
4,"While I like this better, consider the S-Controller","I really like this controller! Unless you are a pre-teen or have unusually small hands, this controller is comfortable and ergonomically designed. I like the slightly different button arrangement than the S-Controller (or PS2) diamond layout. The problem with this controller is that (1) there are too many gamers that are used to the PS2 controller, (2) there are plenty of children that play video game consoles, and (3) third party Xbox controllers (such as Mad Catz) and the new S-Controller use the diamond button configuration. The button configurations are different enough that you can get messed up switching between the two.I think more and more people will migrate to the S-Controller or other third party controllers, and that this controller style will slowly fade out. Unless you have tried these and really like them better than the others (and this happens to be the case for me), you should consider the S-Controller."
1,They messed up my order,"I specifically ordered the original Xbox controllers (like someone else who sent in a review) but I was sent 4 small, turbo controllers. I am hoping that they will replace these turbo controllers with the ones that I want and pay for the shipping because it was clearly their mistake."
1,"bulky, Bulky, BULKY","ok. I never liked the idea of Microsoft making a gaming console, but I gave it a chance anyways. I went down to the local game store, and took it for a spin. Well, the games weren't all that great; even boring at times. But one of the biggest complaints I have about the system is it's controller. If you have never held one, go in to your kitchen, grab a can of spam, and glue a trillion tiny buttons on it, and draw on an oversized X. What I'm tring to get at is this; DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. Buy a gamecube."
3,"Its a controller, not a game.","Like it. It is the original duke, aka its HUGE, like the Sega Dreamcast controller, but larger. The buttons are layed out differently that the s-controller. The Duke has a more slanted box fashion than the upright diamond of the s making it a strange adjustment."
5,best ever!!!!,hi I bought a xbox in the summer because i read good things about it until I came where they said about the controller that it was to big i decided that i'd buy a controller s when i got my xbox i satarted plaing halo the controller felt heavenly it took me i bit to get the buttons cause they were so close together but other then that it was great I don't get it i'm only 12 and the controller fells fine ...i tried the controller s and the triggers kept getting stuck and the start buttons were way on the way my opinion stick wit the original controller
4,Good for adult hands,"Personally I like the XBox controller quite a bit. Prior to getting an XBox I read the concerns regarding the size of the controller and found them to not be true, in my case. When I first held the controller it did seem large, but fit my hands nicely.Both of the analog sticks are nicely positioned and have a good feel to them. The left and right analog triggers are great. They have a long range of motion, enabling you to precisely control input. With these, the gas pedal of a driving game no longer needs to function like an on/off switch.On the downside, well, is the size. I can't imagine this controller fitting the hands of a child or even a young adult. Hopefully aftermarket controllers will be made for those markets. Also, the black and white buttons on the upper right of the controller are a bit difficult to reach. Fortunately the games I've come across don't rely on them for critical gameplay."
4,Overall the controller is pretty nice,The overall controller is pretty nice. I went to a local electronics store and played on the X-Box for about 20 min. The size didn't really bother me and it didn't hurt my hands. I personally like the controller and the only thing I had to get used to was the placement of the buttons.
5,WHAT'S WRONG WITH THIS???,"First of all, I went over to a (retail store) to play the long-awaited XBox and I thought the controller was disturbingly comfortable. I am 5'2"" and I think this controller is perfect :)"
5,Great controller,"I used to have Playstation. It was a completely different change in size. I hated it at first, but after about a day of playing, I got used to it. The rumble is very hard and real. Especially in games like Project:Gotham Racing."
1,Extremly awkward,"if you are buying an x-box, you definatly didn't pick up the controller. It is larger then the dreamcast, with buttons that are so far off that you must remove your entire hand from the controller to reach them, and they are used during gameplay. and ... dollars for this heavy, large controller doesn't make it an atrractive buy"
3,This controller is designed by guys and for guys...,"I do like Xbox a lot and did not mind the bigger controller. Yes, it fits comfortabley in my hands and plays most games well. But wait until you play Galaga and have to press the A button very quickly for the entire game, it can make the thumb feel quite tiring because this controller is bigger, heavier, and thicker. I also have Galaga game for GC. I do play better on GC and get higher scores. I wish there's a smaller Xbox controller that's designed with women and kids in mind."
5,Read this!!,"(...) The controller will take some time to get used to, but once you get used to it it is very comfortable. (...) You should consider buying an Xbox because it will have great sports games, action games, and much more. The sound is outstanding. (...) The Xbox controller is very good (...). Buy an Xbox. It is worth your money."
2,Could have been better...,"The Xbox conroller, in my opinion, is somewhat okay. However, I have many complaints about it. First off, is the size. You can call me a ""10 year old Nintendo fan girl"" if you want (even though I'm not), but it's annoying to try to hold this controller right. I think the two back buttons are blantly ripped off of Dreamcast. Also, there are too many buttons. A Directional pad, two joysticks, six buttons, and two back buttons? I don't own this system, however, I played the demo at a local Sam Goody. It was a hassle trying to hit some of the buttons in fast paced games, and sometimes it gets a bit too confusing with the number of things you have to press. I can see that Xbox is aimed towards adult gamers, however, Microsoft can't ignore the other, younger audiences."
4,"Pretty good for ""big"" people...",This controller is big; no doubt about it. For me it's perfect in size (I'm an adult male). I imagine females and kids will have a bit of a time getting used to it. I like the layout except for the four colored buttons are just a bit to close together. It's easy to get confused on fast games.
2,...,"THe controller is big, akward and a Dreamcast controller ...!Microsoft sayz that they spent hours testing the controller. ... The only good part about this is that it has a 10 foot chord and the L and R bottuns were easy to reach. Other than that, this is the controller ever! Even the original NES controller were better!"
4,"If youve played a dreamcast, this controllers no problem.","When I got this controller i thought ""Great, a controller thats crap."" I was verry surprised that it was verry similar to the dreamcast. All in all its pretty chuncky but one hell of a lot better than the other controllers for the XBox. Of course, I allways prefer a medium sized controler so that also effects my opinion. My freind hates it though because he likes the smaller controllers like the playstation or gamecube controllers. I would give this 4 1/4 stars if that was possible."
3,it's okay,"When you pick up this controller for the first time it seems way too big. I thought it was gigantic since I was used to the playstation controller. But when you are playing a game and you aren't thinking of the box in your hands, it's the perfect size. it's alot better than the ps2 controller for four reasons:1)it still feels comfortable after 5 continuous hours of play2)the joysticks are in a more usable place3)buttons don't hurt as much if your playing games like tony hawk4)better button layoutbut the downsides are:1)microsofts original controllers buttons hurt2)original con. buttons a,b,x,y are too close together, and are in a wierd shape3)hard to use d-pad since it's circular4)controller s has better layout.it kind of resembles playstations controller."
2,"So big, yet so little room......","This controller is the reason that it took me so long to finally purchase an xbox, well the lack of quality games was another reason. I consider myself an avid gamer and like to have my controllers playable. I found this one to be extremely too large, and despite its size the button configuration was terrible, very little room between buttons. I own all three systems and this controller by far is the least comfortable. I would even say that the old school NES controller was even better :). If you are gonna get an xbox get the controller type s. It is a huge improvement over this monster. Still bigger than other controllers but better than this thing"
3,"XBOX CONTROLLER FOR BIG KIDS,NOT FOR LITTLE KIDS.","This controller is big man! Microsoft design the big controller for there big console,did Microsoft like to make big size for us? heh! I think so.I try the controller at future shop,this thing is big alright,I can reach my thumb on the analog stick and the pad with no problem.""But why big for us Microsoft?"" what about the little kids,they like to play your console too,those little kids hand won't reach the pad.Hey Microsoft make xbox controller like PS2 & Gamecube,there controller is medium size and just right for our hands."
4,Great feel but a little too big,"This is a great controller, with a good feel and nice response from the buttons. However, it is just a little bit too big and I hear that Microsoft is/will comming out with a new smaller controller in the future."
2,A really big pad,"This pad is extremley uncomfortalbe. The analog sticks have too much give, the main 4 buttons are too close together and shaped strangley.I MUCH prefer the controller S. Which makes up for everything that is wrong with this pad."
1,"Really, really terrible.","I tried the X-box controller on one of the demo units in an electronics store. I plan to buy an X-box, but the first thing I intend to do is replace the controller. I have big hands, but I still found the Microsoft controller VERY uncomfortable to hold. Also, the black and white buttons are impossible to hit without changing your grip. Microsoft says that this controller is the result of hundreds of hours of playing testing. I just don't see how that can be true. Try the Gamecube for a controller with a perfect grip."
2,Could this thing need any more buttons...?,"I simply do not like this controller. It puts a very difficult strain on both of my wrists to move the thumbs and fingers around to reach these countless buttons, not to mention the controller itself is so incredibly thick.Its thickness is unbelieveably uncomfortable. Reminds me of the Dreamcast controller with its bizarre design. It's true that controllers do take a while to get used to, but with something like this, I don't think I'll ever want to get used to it.I'll stick with a console that doesn't have so many buttons and that fits perfectly in my hands. I'll take one of those cheap rip-off controllers over this thing..."
4,I thought that they didnt sell these anymore,I used to think that they didnt sell these kind of Xbox controllers anymore.I hate using those small controllers.These big ones actually are more comfortable and my hands are puny.
4,Big but comfortable,"I played with this controller the other day at Target and it is big but it is great to handle and fits your hands just right. Overall, i think this will offer a lot of control in the games . The buttons are positioned just right(except maybe the black and white ones). The controller has good response and has good movement controls(the 2 joysticks and the 1 D-pad)."
1,This thing is a big error on a stupid idea on Bill Gates,"Hey this controller is the worst. It's big, heavy, stupid, unconterble, and hard to use. Geez, it's basicly a runoff on the Sega DreamCast controller. Same buttons( Except the D-pad is a anolog on the lower right side of the gamepad) same L,R trigger buttons. It even has the X of a X'd off product. The thing is so freaking big. Who thought of a controller like that. I'm suprised it passed a test to be even made. Take my advice, get a PS2 or a GameCube. Those controllers mold with your hands and are not BIG. Who thought of it????? Really I want to know!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I want to tell this to BIG BILL GATES! The idoit who doesn't know how a person likes a game with a regular controller!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Large and Cumbersome ... stick with the Type S controller,"The original Xbox controller was large, awkward & cumbersome. The poor ergonomic design and the hard to reach positioning of its buttons made the original controller incredibly hard to get used to. Fortunately, there is an alternative - the Xbox type S controller, which I have found to be one of the most comfortable and easy to use gamepads out on the market."
2,Big and clumsy,This thing is a monster. The controls are awkward and it doesn't feel right. I bought the other controller which is smaller and the buttons are placed better. I try not to use this big monster controller. It makes playing games difficult.
4,Needs faster reaction tme,This controller has some strong points but it's a little slow for me. I play Halo everyday I've beat the game five times on legendary difficulty and I want to become faster this isn't meeting my needs but I guess I can't complane Technology isn't too fast. But on every othere occasion it's the best buy. If the controller was faster to react I would pay lots of money. This controller is best for all players. But faster reactions would determine between the Quick and the Dead.
5,The Xbox controller is perfect!,"I love this controller. This is the first game system controller I've every had, that does not make my hand or thumb sore after a couple of hours. As a matter of fact I've had many 6+ hours of non-stop HALO action and still no cramps! I have never held such a perfect controller in my life (30yrs old). This thing fits my hand like a glove!"
2,"good start, terrible finish","The first part of the book is excellent at describing the soul mate phenomena. This includes the various forms and helps provide an understanding on why people come into your life for whom there is an unmistakable connection beyond the apparent. My problem with the book is that at this point it is as if the publisher needed more pages to fill the book. The sections on finding and attracting a soul mate seem totally counter to the very idea that soul mates enter you life when they are destined to do so. The section on attracting your soul mate belongs on soulmates.com or some personals site. When the book digressed into ranting about how super models are overly thin and not the way ""real"" women look I found myself wondering if I dozed off and then picked up another book. What this is doing in there I have no idea. The first half gets 4 stars, the second zero. A caveat, several trusted friends have found this book to be very beneficial. I just cannot say the same."
3,Soul Mates,"I enjoyed this book..Ease read, and also more importantaly, because it now made me realize that ""soul mates"" can be anyone from our first loves, husbands, mothers, sons or daughters...Even friends...There are many meanings of soul mates and it can be found in anyone of those important people in our lives..."
3,im short on words but a vary fair movie,like i said im a man of few words but i think it was a all right movie and it was funny take my advise and check out this movieif your a laurel and hardy fan like me.
3,"Some interesting material, but too loosely organized.","This book is an extended essay on the proper role of pictures of suffering, and what constitutes a moral way to react to such pictures. Sontag touches on a number of other issues along the way, as well as providing an historical perspective. In fact, Sontag sees such pictures as in the tradition of religious paintings and sculptures which graphically have depicted suffering, in Christianity and in pagan myths. Sontag does not reach many definite conclusions, and those pretty much in the last 2 short chapters, but looks at each issue as objectively as she can. While there was much interesting material, the book, short as it is, is organized much too loosely for my taste, and is even repetitious, so that I often found myself skimming."
1,"Ambiguous, Flighty, and Very Difficult to Follow!","I really wanted to like this book, but it was so long-winded and unfocused. I felt that I was being pulled through the dark forest of the author's mind rather than the concrete experience of other people's pain. If she had written this as a journal it would have made more sense-maybe?"
1,meandering,"I found this a difficult book to read.The author uses long meandering sentences frequently enough to distract attention;and her thesis is unclear.The author also tends to make generalising statements,with no evidence to back the statements up.The book does not say anything new;I was disappointed overall."
5,ENHANCING YOUR QUALITY OF LIFE,"Once again Dr Bob has provided a road map to realizing ones full potential. While his previous work concentrated on diet and fitness ( ""..guide to turning back the clock"" and ""..revolutionary weight control program"")Dr bob's new book completes the picture by incorporating advice for creating and maintaining the positive mental attitude which is the foundation of success. His emmminently readable style and usefull personal examples make this book not only interesting but easy to use in your day to day life. after reading the section on using music to create a mental mood I have been using netradio.com to broadcast jazz through my office computer. I have lowered my level of stress and find it easier to focus on what is important. If you incorporate only one of the many recommendation into your daily life you will find that this book is an excelent investment in yourself."
1,Obvious and Insulting,"After reading a review of this book in a magazine, I bought it expecting information I could use in my daily life. Instead, the book runs the gamut from the obvious (music affects your mood) to the insulting (if you ever feel stuck or in a rut, just go helicopter skiing in the Canadian Rockies!!). Uh, gee, thanks Bob. Next time I have a year's salary to blow on a vacation I'll be able to take you up on that. Most of Dr. Bob's advice will be useful only to those with six-figure-plus salaries and lots of control over how they spend their time. If you're an ordinary working person, like me, earning an average salary and lacking control of the hours of her day, pass this one by."
2,Oster Fast Feed Clipper,This clipper is not quiet at all it is actually quite loud. Sounds like a coffee grinder. It is louder than my Conair clipper. I was hoping to get a quiet one to cut my kids hair so they would not be afraid of it but now I'm stuck with it cause my kids tore the box. If I could do it over I would probably go to my local Sally's and have them turn it on to see how loud it is. It it does cut more evenly than my Conair so I don't feel as bad being stuck with it.
3,Serie de Oro by Los Shakers,"This is the only mass-produced compilation by this group and it doesn't give them justice. Los Shakers were a south american band that not only followed in the Beatles footsteps, they were the ""Unofficial Other Fab Four"", yet they still had originality. They were music idols throughout South America, but ignored by the rest of the World. After all, why settle for a south american copy when you can have the ""veddy british original"". That doesn't mean oldies compilers like Rhino or Sundaze should ignore Los Shakers. There's more justified 32-track compilation called ""Por Favor"". When it comes to getting a copy of that cd, lets just say it might be easier to see the Stones Live."
5,verbatim is the best,"this blank media is the most relible product thus for. Maybe 2 (two) disc's out of 300 may fail, not 20-25 out of 50 like some blanks do. Very relible!!!!"
5,Reliable Media - Not a Bad One in the Bunch!,"I have heard about many other brands of media being riddled with unusable blanks (a.k.a. coasters, frisbees). This is not the case with Verbatim. No problems whatsoever in recording or playing. The DVD burner recognizes them instantly and since I have a 16X Writer, it automatically burns at 12X. One of the other reviews cautioned against this, but I have not had any playback problems with discs burned at that speed. The digital quality is great. Verbatim may cost a little more, but in my opinion it's worth it."
3,Oracle Application Server 10g Web Development (Oracle Press),"If you want to know how to use OAS 10g with your development tools, this book is cover it. But not too detail. I hope I can find a book with best practise suggestion how to use OAS10g with form and report or java tools."
4,good reference material - just wish for a little more on XP,so far quite good for explaining things simply and quickly. good reference book. too bad it did not have more on windows XP but lots on vista. Big book though and you will have to spend a little time reading same but enjoyable reading so no problem.
3,PC For Dummies,PC for Dummies is good but not enough for illiterate technical computer users like me. I like detailed information from A to Z in regards to how to fix my computer when it locks up and/or has a bad error.
1,I did not get what i sent for,"the book is a good book, but this is not what i ordered and had the church order 25 of them and they all came wrong. a day before the graduation of our computer class, i checked the box and it was nothing like we ordered. they said we would get the 8-in-1 with the new Vista information. we had to use the books as the gift anyway, because of me being so busy and trusting i was getting what i ask for, i didnt check the box until the night before graduation. what a fool i gave out 25 books and ordered one for me at home, all the wrong thing. the books went to st augustine's church and my home. even the book they are having me review is not the book i received. i received xp information. 256.00 from the chruch and 15.00 from me. WOW what a disappointment."
4,Start them on Blackford Oakes when they're young.,"I tend to not appreciate fiction. I read a lot of brain candy as a child, but one day in my early teens I picked up this book.1) I met William F. Buckley, Jr.2) I saw revolutionaries from a different angle.3) I developed a desire to read books with substance.4) I was innoculated against Steinbeck.It's engaging fiction that young people can enjoy. Let them get a little bit of this perspective before their pinko profs get them."
2,Solid Chuck but ....,Ok I bought this chuck to use with my new Jet Mini lathe. Fits great with little work. It came in a very simple box with a one page diagram of the lathe. There were no instructions of any sort about the dozen parts that came with it. It was covered in preservative oil to keep it from rusting ... thickly covered. (remove this because it will bleed into your wood)The reason this gets 2 stars is because when I use the breaking bars that tighten the chuck they bent pretty badly. I figure after about half a dozen uses they will be bent to the point that I will be forced to find new bars.Poor quality parts never impress me .... You get what you pay for with this one. Cheap price ... cheap piece.
1,No Beef,"This product has undersized screws to hold in jaws. One of them was over tightened at the factory and could not be loosened. I had to be drill it out. The tightening handles are inadequate and bent during the first few uses. Nice price,but not good quality."
2,psi Mini4 jaw Scroll chuck,"I received this chuck 3 weeks ago,delivered very quickly.However packaging was insufficient and the chuck had exited thru the side of the box on delivery.The Tommy bars are too soft for the action of the chuck.The threads in the chuck one inch 8tpi are too big for a small lathe and the insert is 3/4ins 14tpi, too fine a thread to fit most small lathes sold in Australia. Once we purchase a blank insert and have it threaded ,it is no longer a bargain!The action is good ,the jaws grip evenly and firm.The spare jaws are well made and fit well. Should have bought a Basic Nova at $45.00 and had it threaded!"
4,Military noir provides character study,"Lawrence Block wrote this military noir early in his writing career about Paul Kavanagh, an ex-Green Beret who retires from the trade. What's interesting is that Paul falls in love with his solitary, Crusoe-like life on a deserted Florida Keys island. George Dattner hunts up Paul and they plot to steal a shipment of nuclear weapons from the military in the Dakotas. Paul tells their caper in a low-keyed, conversational manner. He gets so far in, you're left wondering if he'll ever get back to his island paradise a million dollars richer. This novel is a brisk read, and one of the better retired-from-the-trade crime books. Don't expect flashy descriptions and over-the-top plotlines. Mr. Block is interested in his protagonist first."
3,Not his best,"My expectations were too high given Mr. Block's consistent quality of writing in every other work I've read. I thought this was a little to Clancy-esque a plotline (the writing was still character driven though), and the protagonist, an ex-Green Beret who's psyche is supposed to be interestingly off kilter, was maybe a bit too complex a character for Block to portray early in his writing career. Nevertheless, I'd recommend it for killing a few hours on a plane."
5,Bluesy Hard Rock...Great Solo Album!!!,"I'm not going to write a long review. I just want to say that every song on this album kicks butt!!! Some songs kind of remind me of Doug Aldridge's - Burning Rain.How can anyone listen to the song ""Angel"" and not feel afterwards...OH MY GOD???FIVE BIG STARS.....ALL THE WAY!!!!!!"
3,Was it worth waiting?,"I'm a fan of Allen's voice, but I would have really liked to hear less variety of styles. ""We will fly"" and ""Gaia"" are my favorite songs. Everything else is kinda ""I'm here but I didn't arrive yet"". Maybe his next effort will be more directed. Three stars is all I could give."
2,"Great singer, but not on this album","It's a crying shame, i've been waiting for this album for a long time.The musicians sound Ok, but Sir Russell? sounds better on the Symphony X albums. He was at his best on Ayreon's Flight of the migrator."
1,Scary,"This is a premier rock vocalist? Are you kidding me? One note, no talent screeching in a very limited register. There are at least 10 rock vocalists in your own town right now that could put this guy to shame. Besides that, his voice is incredibly irritating. Comparing this effort to rock legends is nothing short of blasphemy. Could come is handy in interrogating Al Queda terrorists but would be declared in violation of the Geneva Convention. And rightfully so. Just awful!"
3,Mediorcre at best,It had a good love story to it but the ending wasn't done the way it should have been. If the end was a cliff hanger then ok wheres the next one? Anyway the ending just wasn't right.
4,Perceptions,"This was a good story concerning ""expectations"" of being ones self. Each of the three characters was unable to show their true ""self"" even to their closest friends and family. It was an intricate balance that once exposed changed all lives concerned."
1,omg what happen here,Ok I have never asked for my time back.... in this case I WANT IT ALL BACK!!!I so wanted to like this movie i really did(WHY) THERE SOME GREAT NAMES..I THINKING IT HAS TO BE GOOD RIGHT (WRONG).. its just not GOOD at all!!!!A few cute guys thats about it.. the story line is so messed up.... and the end if you make it that far... STUPID and I dont use that word!!I thought THE Son &Father relationship was weird.. BEST FRIEND WAS SO CONFUSED .also the little girl in the flim didnt fit at times.... also a lot of racist talk..not cool!!!And thats your review from the review guy
3,Surely something better for the money is out there,"Purchased for our new nursery, picture quality isn't great and if you have wireless internet, cordless phones or use your cell phones alot it will interfere. We've tried changing the channels, moving equipment and it is grainy with alot of lines still. Not worth the money, but we're stuck."
3,very good,I like the product. It is what I was looking for and meets my requirements. Dell computers always are good.
2,Choo Choo Trains-close up and very personal,"I was disappointed with this video. The pictures were okay but there was no spoken information about what you were watching. My children like to learn about what they are watching and there was no explanation for what the train engineers were doing or what type of engine they were on. Also, most of the engines that they showed were very old and not what your child sees going down the tracks these days."
4,"A great ""second"" train video.","My son enjoys this video because its visually interesting. There is no narration , just train sounds. That's not necessarily a bad thing as long as you (the parents) have the answers every time your kid asks,""what's that?"" I recommend There Goes A Train as a companion to this video because Engineer Dave explains everything in an informative and entertaining way."
1,VERY disappointed!,"This craft is NOT worth buying! All of the puffy paint stuff falls off of it, immediately, when it is picked up. We even waited a few days before moving it just to make sure that the paint was try. I bought two of these for both of my daughter's birthdays. Now I don't know what to do with the other one. Not happy that I spent my money on this."
2,fit,liked the product but for someone who always wears a large the large was still too small and was forced to return and re-order.
2,Not size shown,"The teapot is sturdy, and very pretty. However it is NOT a two quart pot as stated. Very disappointed with sizing mistake."
5,A remarkable versatile tool.,"I purchased this reconditioned 18V Dewalt impact driver, can say that this tool is one of the most versatile and handy tools I have been fortunate to purchase. If I were to buy another one I think that I would purchase the 14V model as it is a little lighter, but this beast will drive a 3"" screw like hot butter, you just have to keep the head on the screw and let it do it's thing. GREAT!!!"
1,wrong item advertised,"The photo clearly shows the led model but upon arrival it is not that model and so will not fit my existing charger.Now, I have to by a separate charger. I would have been time and money ahead to buy it at the local store."
2,Needed more pictures,"Although the idea for this book is very good . Instead of staying on the subject and trying to explain to a novice what all this is about it goes on to other things like novelty edges etc which is not the reason I bought the book for. And they don't as usually make good use of the available pages for instance there are great big pictures of the finished project and tiny ones for the steps and very few for these. And then a whole page of a picture of materials which is completely useless like page 22, 86, 84, 72, 66 and of course page 58 which appears twice in this book. Such a waste of pages and photographs."
5,SIMPLY STUNNING!!!,"What a wonderful book! A feast for the senses. Full of delightful suggestions and techniques...from the very basic to simply sumptuous and decadent, rich in colors and textures and STYLE. In short, a must have book for anyone who loves to create!"
4,Sewing Edges and Corners,Great book with excellent examples. A definite recommendation for both the item and Seller.
4,Helpful book,I liked this book - it found it to be helpful in learning to make good corners and edges.Instructions with pictures were good.
3,missing chapter,"So disappointed, was reading book recently and discovered a whole chapter was missing. This book was spiral bound so missing pages were not easily noticed till you got to that chapter. This was a reference book for sewing. Buyers beware."
4,Sewing Edges & Corners,I enjoy making cushions and pillows for my home and was interested in this book after previewing some of the pages at Amazon.com. I felt it could be very helpful in creating different looks with the edges shown. The directions are easy to understand and follow.The price of this book is very reasonable for the content and I did receive the book in the time frame promised.
5,Wonderful Book!,"I wish I could give this book 10 stars! I first saw this book (along with Alphabet Mystery and Alphabet Rescue) in a school book order catalog, and we decided to check them out at the library to see if we'd like them. My 3 year old son loved them so much that we just ordered all 3 in hardcovers because they were only being sold in paperback from school. He LOVES them all, but Alphabet Adventure is both his and my favorite. This is such a cute book and my son is learning his lowercase letters from it.I would recommend this book to anyone with small children that are learning the alphabet, or learning to read and write."
5,Another Wonderful Book From the Woods,"As soon as I discovered that Alphabet Adventure was on the bookshelves, I rushed to purchase it. Being a Kindergarten teacher, I am always looking for quality books to use with the children in my classroom. Each page of Alphabet Adventure is filled with a wealth of extension activities for children learning their a b c's. Characterization of the letters will bring interest to the emergent reader as Little 'i' tries to find her dot. I plan to use this book as a springboard for my introduction at a staff development meeting next week. Thank you Audrey and Bruce for your contribution to the classroom by providing outstanding literature appropriate for the young child."
4,Alphabet Adventure,"The Woods do it again - beautiful illustrations that capture even the very young reader's imagination. My son who is 22 months old searches the page for details that he keeps discovering with each go round. I still like 'Quick as a Cricket' best and so does he. That book was a surprise with each turned page and had alot of variety in it, not to mention the short rhythmic text that captivates the younger toddlers. The variety is lacking in this one but it's still a hoot and worth every penny."

3,Incomplete information for conures just as pets,"This book is a good source for those who are looking for information on basic care and breeding of conures. However, it gives little information on keeping Conures as pets. There are almost no training tips given."
3,Not a great information source for keeping companion birds.,"This is not of great value to the average companion bird owner. It is geared mainly to the individual interested in breeding and setting up a breeding avaiary. There is very scant info on personality and characteristics. As most info is for breeding purposes,all cage and care requirements are written for at least 2 birds. Almost all info is provided concerning wild caught, or nearly adult-parent reared offspring. As it is so easy to locate a good breeder that hand rears young, this is of little use. This book did not meet my needs, but would be useful to a perspective breeder of Sun Conures."
3,My Review,"This book is great for those who have just purchased their new conure. There are beautiful illustrations and many colored photos. But the book is mostly about breeding and it contained words that weren't really clear. It should have had more tips on training the bird. But other than those, i would say that it would be a good book to buy."
2,"Conures: Everything about Purchasing, etc....",This book is to helpful in your curiosity about the kinds of conures there are & how to house them but hardly any info. is given on how to understand they're personality or on their habits & how to explore them further.
3,"good basic information, good starter book","User friendly, good photographs, simple text and easy to read. Not enough warning about how loud these birds are but other than that pretty comprehensive."
4,Not bad for what was covered,"Tried to cover many aspects with short information. I would have liked to read more on behavior. Foods to stay away from and training were not covered at all. Overall this book is more for the beginning breeder, less for the pet owner. Still I am glad to have it."
2,Smokey Joe's Cafe,"I was thrilled when I found a book my favorite author on a trip to England as his work is difficult to find in the States. Have to admit that it was not on par with any of his others that I've read, and I think I've read them all. Can't recommend this one. Try one of his others."
2,Bryce's Smokey Attempt,"I have read many of Bryce Courtenay's book and enjoyed all of them, except this one. This book had a good story line, a part of Australian history, like elsewhere in the world, which the majority of the community tried to forget. Only now are they starting to get the proper recognition that they deserve like the many Australian soldiers who have died before and after them in the service of their nation. This group is the Vietnam Vets.And maybe that is why I am critical of this book. The storyline is there and so much could have been done with it, but it feels that Bryce wrote this story because he felt that the plight of the Vets needed to be told but it appears that he did not put 100% effort into this book. I rate Bryce's work highly. I just wished that he fleshed this story out more instead of the light fluffy story which brushes over the issues without feeling."
5,This book isn't just for nurses,"I noticed the word ""humanizing"" in another reader's review, and I feel that is the perfect word to describe this book. Satterly gives us a glimpse into the world of healthcare and its many issues. She poses thought-provoking questions about the current healthcare crisis. It is an easy book to read even if you are, like me, completely unfamiliar with the terms used in the medical world. I will look at my nurse differently the next time I have to go to the ER."
3,Left wondering...?,"While I appreciate the efforts put into, ""Where Have All The Nurses Gone""?...I come away feeling a little empty handed. Satterly starts out with compelling stories of nurses struggling with their day to day, crippling workloads, describes some of the reasons for the errosion of healthcare, explains some of the importance of what it is nurses do and tells us something most nurses know about [but, ignore at great price] and that is, ""The patient most in need of attention is the nursing profession itself.""There was no clear picture on ideas of how to recruit & retain nurses, no explanation of accountability of the healthcare management/government...or suggestions on how to correct the undoing.Although preventative health (patients looking after their weight, blood pressure and so forth) is very important...all these stats and listings of groups/organizations just didn't ""solve"" anything for me."
5,"I admit it, I saw the name on the cover and picked it up...","...and after the first 50 pages I thought to myself, ""Uh-oh. He's done it again and screwed up for all of the world to see."" In case you were under a rock during the OJ trial - Darden was the male prosecutor. And, it first it did seem that this book was floundering and going to be another bust for Darden.However, what I mistook for floundering was actually the plot being carefully laid out - including intricate subplots, betrayals (lots of betrayals) and bizarre dead ends that mislead the reader to the very last page. When you finally get a handle on what the bad guys are up to you then wonder which guys are the bad guys, which are the good guys and who is just out for themselves. When this book finally played out, it was well worth the initial confusion.I'll be looking for his other books."
3,"Some quotes are funny, some are meh","This is a nice book to give to a doctor or med student. It'll bring a smile to their face, and some of the quotes are legitimately funny. But on the whole, it's not as funny as it could have been."
3,Good Intro Book For African Campaign,"This is a good read. The author is a journalist, not a soldier, so although its written well it lacks the accuracy that only a soldier could provide. For example - the author refers to just about any firearm except a rifle as a Tommy-Gun. Well the Germans, nor the Italians, used Tommy-Guns. Its not that important for the overall story, but it does tend to get a bit annoying.There are some great little stories here. Personal stories of tragedy. Moorehead does these best. This is a great book for those who want an Intro into the African Campaign. However, readers who know the background and overall history of this element of the Second World War will find it lacking. Could use some better maps as well, nothing more frustrating than references to places that are not on any maps in the book!Check out Brazen Chariots, by Bob Crisp, for a great little book on tank warfare in the desert."
4,Works well,"For a portable pump this is excellent. Small and light, with a convenient bracket it does just as advertised.The fold-out foot and folding T handle make it relatively easy to get a tire to a usable pressure. It also has a pressure gauge.I do not have the arm muscle strength needed for getting decent pressure with the pumps that attach directly to the tire valve. The Topeak pump attaches to the valve through a hose so you can use your whole upper body strength and weight to achieve a higher pressure.Its not a shop pump but if I had to have only one bicycle pump this would be my choice."
4,Great pump for the price,"This pump works pretty well and is great for the road if you don't mind mounting it to your frame or putting it in pannier bags. The mounting hardware is a nice touch and is pretty low profile if you have an extra set of water bottle holes to fasten it to, otherwise you have to use zip ties, which come in the package. For the moment, this is my only pump, but I recommend getting a floor pump with a gauge for convenience.Overall, I like the pump. Be careful with the hose and other moving parts. I haven't broken anything, but some people think these things should be indestructible. The pressure gauge is a nice touch, but realistically gives you a +/- 3 to 5 ballpark psi, but it's better than no gauge at all. It's pretty easy to pump too, especially if you keep one hand on the aluminum cylinder."
1,Instructions would help,"As noted by others, this pump has to be properly configured before using and specific steps for this pump need to be adhered to. It is the latter that was the undoing of my tire. It was not made clear you needed to loosen the outer ring of the pump prior to putting it on the valve and that the lever works OPPOSITE to what you expect (meaning you pulling up and away from the hose to engage it). The end result is that from fighting this pump I punctured the tube (I am assuming at the stem to the inner tube).I would not recommend this pump to others until Topeak puts more effort in documentation. It is lame they do not have any instructions online either..."
3,Nice directions - NOT!,"Because there are none! Oh don't get this thing expecting it to make your life easier. I'm gonna get something better most definitely but so long as this doesn't break, or break my hands (toooouuuuggggghhhhhh handle, horrid bad bad bad) then uh...... well, as long as I can go fill up my tire I'm probably gonna throw this out right after. People are too nice with reviews, this thing is alright but anyone who five stars this is beyond insane. Five means best. The tip fits on valve stems like putting a round peg in a square hole. This pump's amazon rating is a round peg in a square hole."
5,My 2 cents,"I'll keep it short so that I don't repeat much that has already been said.If you want a frame-mounted pump, I don't think it gets much better than this. The inline gauge works pretty well, and I can get it over 110 psi with a little sweat after it gets past 90.Came with screws (if replacing a water bottle holder) as well as straps to mount to the top tube instead, in addition to the velcro straps and plastic clips on the mount itself.Instructions were admittedly sparse, but I trust that most people will either figure it out, or use one of the above reviews for guidance where necessary."
5,Excellent pump. Only one I need!,"I have been cycling for about five months now and this is the pump for me. I realize I haven't tried that many different pumps, but I am incredibly happy with this pump. I am on a very strict budget (terrible for a cyclist), and as a result, this is the only pump I have. I don't have a floor pump for a presta valve, this pump does it every time, and i have yet to complain. The price is very competitive, it looks good, the quality of construction leaves nothing for want. the only problem is that there is no manual. i had to google the pump once i got it to figure out how to use it on my friend's schrader valve tube. still a great buy"
4,Bom produto,"O Gauge no funciona muito bem, marca menos do que realmente é.O apoio pra encher no é firme e vc termina fazendo mais fora no centro da palma da mo.Mas enche o pneu bem, aconselho a sempre ir ao máximo, pois estara mais proximo da presso final do pneu."
2,Difficult to use,"I could only get this pump to work with a Presta valve and a Schraeder adapter. The basic problem is getting a proper fit on the tire valve. With a plain Schraeder valve, the gasket is so tight that forcing it on the valve depresses the valve into the tire. The lock nut on the Presta valve keeps the valve firm, but I cannot get the pump hose tightly on the valve (I did reverse the pump gasket). When attached, the pump does work better than my old portable pump, and the gauge is nice."
5,Perfect little air pump,"This pump is EASY to use. Changing the valve setup takes under a minute. Shipped in presta configuration. I changed it to schraeder on first use on the side of the road in a minute. Unscrew the valve clamp cap, pull out the top two pieces (one plastic and one brass in my case) flip their orientation and replace in reverse order of extraction (brass, then plastic in my case) and screw the cap on! Now you have a single pump to use on any tire valve you own. You can even stop to help out a guy in need on the trail now.Happy riding!"
3,Older model works better,"This is a good sturdy pump that will last you years. The main problem is that the handle is too small and when you fold it out you apply force unevenly. The older model had the handle centered on the piston, which resulted in much easier operation. They attempted to make the pump smaller, and achieved that, but the older, larger model works better."
5,Works like a charm,"This is a pretty big pump as far as ""compact pumps"" go. It's a little too small to keep in the garage for your ""everyday pump"". The gauge is not super accurate, but perfect for on the road/trail pumping. If you want a good, durable, and powerful pump larger pump with a built in gauge... this is it."
2,Terrible,"I bought this specific pump thinking it was going to be great. I read the reviews, researched and even went to see it at a bike shop. After about a week I noticed how horrible it is compared to all my lezyne pumps. I would rather spend the extra 10 bucks and get a pump with an ACCURATE gauge. And the parts on this pump are just cheap. Invest in a Lezyne pump if you want a gauge."
5,"really quite nice, lightweight and easy","Well designed, feels sturdy, easily does higher pressure, and the gauge appears to be entirely adequate considering you don't have to carry another. Very lightweight. Pretty much exactly what I'd hoped for. To do it over again, I suppose I might go with one of the even tinier pumps this company offers; between my other frame mounted items...water bottle and lock, there was just barely enough room for this pump to coexist (I have a hybrid Trek) and still allow the water bottle to be removed. It made it, but just barely. I do like having just that little bit longer pump travel, though, in the longer length. Highly recommended, but I only just received it and can't speak for durability just yet."
1,The handle does not stay locked in place when I pump,"Since this is a travel pump the handle bar folds flat when not in use. Because of this design, when I pump to get my bike to 110 psi and it gets difficult to push down the pump near the end, the handle bar snaps down a lot instead of the actual pump. It hurts my hand and is frustrating because I end up having to pump a lot longer to make it to 110. I wish I thought to return this sooner, now it is too late.Gauge is not accurate, but it is good enough."
5,back up floor pump,"I have used this pump for five with my BikeFriday around the world. I needed a new pump when I sold the BikeFriday. This pump gives the high pressure you need for road bikes. It is great when people run out of cartridges. We have a lot of good riders in the group, but not so good mechanic. They have a lot of pinch flats because riders do not seat and check the beads after a flat. The Road Morph has become our group backup. It has the pressure, ease of use and reuse that cartridges don't have."
1,"Too small, no strenght","The pump is too small, if you want to reach more than 6 pressure, you'll have to put gloves and say welcome to backpain."
3,seems ok,"I have not had a flat tire since I brought this pump, but I have tried it out on a spare tube and it worked ok. The gauge did not seem to work."
1,Blackburn is better,"Bottom line this pump has too many bells and whistles that prevent it from functioning as designed!I have relied on Blackburn products for years and have toured throughout southeast asia via bike through areas known for some of the worst roads in the world with my trusty Blackburn Mountain Air pump. I foolishly gave my Blackburn pump to a friend thinking it would be easy to replace and thought I would try a Topeak product. Unfortunately I have been very unhappy with it.Bottom line stick with a simple no frills no gimmics pump, this one sucks, unfortunately not in the way you would want a pump to suck or blow!"
1,terrible worst pump ive ever seen or tried to use,horrible. Three people couldn't figure out how to get the pump to work. First off the pump didn't come up with a manual but terrible hard to follow steps on the back of package. Even after following the steps and trying everything possible the pump still wouldn't work right. I would have given this zero stars but amazon will only let it go down to one star. Waste of 30 dollars i would recommend buying a different pump all together. What a waste of 30 dollars this thing is crap.
1,Do not buy!,"First of all, as in the other reviews it was not easy to figure out but once I did, it would not fill air into my presta road bike. When I changed it to Schraeder, it did not fill air and then when I tried to take it out it was on so tight it ripped my valve off, ruining the tire. Waste of time and money!!"
1,The parts just fall off!,"Every time I try to use this stupid pump, the little lever that I flip up to secure the pump on my valve stem falls off and I have to search the ground for the little black pin that holds it all together. (It seems to be held together by the manufacturer's wishful thinking.) There was also a plastic part on the bottom (that is either a skid plate of sorts or just a useless decoration) that just fell off while I was riding, never to be seen again. The people who made this pump should have found a way to get the plastic bits to stay together."
1,Doesn't live up to it's potential.,"I ""had"" this pump for a year and a half and used it half a dozen times. I had similar problems to other reviewers. I had to use another manufacturer's mounting bracket and velcro strap to get it on my bike and the overall construction and parts are second-rate. My biggest gripe however is that the piston/pump arm just broke off the other day when I was repairing a flat that I got when riding to work. I was only able to get my tube inflated half way before this happened. Fortunately I was a couple of miles from a bike shop that was actually open at 7:30 in the morning and I was able to get some air and pick up a Lezyne pump from them (which also has a pressure gauge built in). I do a lot of long-distance riding on my own and can't take a chance that my pump is going to fail."
4,Good on the bike pump to get you home,"Bought this pump here on Amazon last month. Tight fit on the down tube of my Felt Z-80 (54) and have to mount the pump upside down. Bought it based on reviews here and it will surely test you if you try to use this as a cheap replacement for a floor pump (recently purchased the Super Pista for that purpose). Trying to go over 120 with the Road Morph G will be a chore, but if you have that flat on the road and need to get home, this pump is more than up to the task. Nice features include the small size, foot pedal to help you securely pump and the gauge. I gave it a four rating because I disagree that this unit will replace your floor pump. I need 130-145 psi with my Vittoria Zaffiros and the Topeak would either give out or give me a hernia!"
4,Perfect fit for moderate biker,I really liked this pump for its slim fit on my bike frame combined with the pressure gauge feature. This is a really great feature -- I do not know much about tire pressure and it makes me feel like I will be able to fix my own flats!
5,Best Pump I Have Ever Had,I have had my Topeak Road Morph pump for almost 10 years now and never had any problems with it at all. I have tried many different pumps before and can find nothing that even comes close to this one. Make sure you buy one of these- you'll be glad you did!!
4,It's cute and works,"Glad to have this item rather than the gas chargers. Saves you money on gas chargers but you will gain weight on your ride. I'm glad to have it though, always share the pump with people before my rides."
1,Disappointing,"This may be a good pump. It has some nice features and lots of positive reviews. When I ordered it, I'd planned to mount it under my water bottle cage. Oh no. If you don't have a spare set of mounts you can dedicate to this pump, you have to strap it on with cable ties and wait for the paint to get worn off your bike frame. C'mon! Avenir, Specialized, Bell, Schwinn, Blackburn, Hurricane, Planet Bike all make pumps with brackets that can be mounted under a water bottle cage. I passed on those pumps to get this highly regarded pump which I cannot use without rigging something with cable ties! If I wanted that, I could strap my good floor pump to my handlebars with duct tape. I guess I'll make the rounds of local bike shops to try to find someone else's bracket that will make this Topeak pump useable. Very frustrating and disappointing."
1,Not worth the risk or the aggravation!,"First try doesn't attach to valve. Reverse parts as seen on the video at the manufacturer's website, still won't attach to valve. I try every possible combination of parts in the head and one works. Pump up my tire, that's OK. Try to get the head off the valve and nearly rip the valve off the tube! You have to be really careful and hold onto the valve as you remove the head, or you will rip the valve off your tube as another reviewer experienced! This thing is going in the trash and I will try before I buy a new pump at the bike/toy store! Zero stars!"
4,Muy bueno,Tiene buenos elementos para adherir a la bicicleta y me ha respaldado en todos los recorrdiso hechos en largas distancias con la bicicleta
3,Topeak Morph G Bike Pump,"The pump inflates tires fine, but it is very difficult to release from the valve stem. Instuctions are non-existant for pump usage."
2,Locks onto valve stems,"I tried this out in my garage before heading out on a ride and the pump head locked onto my schraeder valve stem. I wiggled and wiggled, flipped the lever up and down, until eventually the stem tore off of my inner tube. My wife was convinced I did something wrong, so she tried it on her presta valve tube with a similar experience. We stopped before tearing the valve stem off of the tube, though, and unscrewed the collar that holds the head together. Once that was loosened a couple of turns the valve stem came right out.I still use this pump, but now I unscrew the collar every time I need to remove the pump from a valve stem."
1,Too bad you have to give it one star,"Bought the pump, attached it to the bike and used it once in the first 10 months. Then when I needed it, I found that the whole pump ""head"" (that attaches to the valve) had come unscrewed and fallen out. You would think that the parts would stay together. Called Todson (distributor of Topeak). Some customer service. ""Duh, well buy a new head kit."" Isn't the pump supposed to stay in one piece?There are many better pumps out there. Cateye has such great customer service. Too bad they don't make pumps"
3,Ok for low pressure tires,"This pump will work just fine for bikes with low pressure tires, but it gets very difficult to use above 90 psi. I have high pressure tires that need to be inflated to 100 - 140 psi. I am not a small guy at all, but my hands and arms were killing me by the time I got the tire pressure to about 120 psi. It felt like I had done a weightlifting workout! I will keep the pump in case I get a flat on the road, but I am going to buy another pump for home use only. The other problem with this pump is that it doesn't easily mount anywhere on the frame of the bike. There is no mounting kit included with the pump, so you'll have to jury rig something or stick it in a pannier or backpack."
2,Pump head falls off,"I have to give this product 1 star because I wasn't even able to use it when I needed. When I went to use it for the first time I found that the whole pump head had come unscrewed. I'm trying to get a replacement pump head, but I'm concerned the same thing will happen.1/11/12Update: I added a star because the customer service was very responsive. I told them about the issue and since my pump was still under warranty, they sent me the replacement parts for free. I got them in only a few days. I haven't increased my start rating more than that because I am watching to see if I have the same problem. I will be checking on the tightness of the connection prior to each ride."
2,"No Instruction on how to change valve, or how to use pump!","There were NO instructions included with the pump on how to change from the presta valve setup to the schrader valve setup that I needed! The pictures on the product packaging ARE NOT OF THE VALVE COMPONENTS that actually were in the pump! Only my neighbor's help kept me from returning the product. Even after the apparent correct setup it is still difficult to push the connector onto the valve of the tire tube, especially when the tube really needs some air. After 'locking' the thumb lever out, the connector would often just fly off, especially as the pressure in the tube increased.I just hope that this piece of junk will work should I ever need it on the road! In the meantime I'll just have to check the air in the tires before I leave the garage and fill them to pressure with my trustworthy Sears Compressor!Topeak should 'Morph' their G Bike Pump into one that really works!"
3,"works well, falls appart","this pump was awesome for getting back up and riding quickly, but after about 1.5 years of having this on my bike or in my bag, occaisionally dropping it, it has fallen appart in a number of ways. the little foot stand disappeared first, then the plastic top of the pump shatered, was super-glued and shattered again. finally the lever on the nozle lost its pin. I didn't treat this pump poorly... its just not durable at all.that all being said, for $30 im gonna buy another..."
4,"So Far, So Good","I got the Topeak Morph G before a gruelling 1000km tour, and came out at the other end quite pleased with the pump.As other reviewers have mentioned, it gets to ~90psi quite quickly, but gets to 120psi after a bit of huffing and puffing. (To be expected, can't get miracles from a small size pump)All in all, I am glad I got the pump, as it allowed me to get to my full tire pressure and to continue with my ride without worrying abt riding with reduced pressure in my wheels."
4,Must for high pressure road bike tires,"A little large and hard to mount. Must can only be on top tube and can interfere with brake cable. Most mini pump say they can go to 100+ lbs but only if you have patience or arm muscles like -- big. This pump, with its hose, will let put you back into pumping and not break valve stem, which I have done with pumps without hose attachments."
4,Functions Great -- Could Be Tougher,"Functionally, this does exactly what I want: it's small, has a hose, has a foot stand, and good volume for a small pump. But it feels cheap, and I'm not convinced the flip-up handle and flip-down foot stand can take much abuse. Still, seems to be the best bet for the price. I'd pay more for a more robust model."
3,Nice pump but wears you out,Bought this pump to use when I take my bike on long road trips by car. Wanted something smaller than a std pump that would fit in my tool bag but easier to use than a frame pump. It does the job but it is a workout to get to 120psi. Will have to use it some more to see if it will work for my application. Pump head is OK but not as good as Top Peak's std pump head.
1,Stupid and Frustrating,"Using a pump should not be this hard. The pump allegedly comes in the Presta valve setting and you can change the pump head to accommodate other valves. My tire valves were Presta so I was set to go. However I was not, for the pump head would not fit on the valve at all. All you are given is a stupid diagram on the back of the box showing you the anatomy of the pump head. I figured a piece was missing so I took the head apart and only two pieces were removable. I emailed the company and they said there should be three removable pieces not just two. The company offered to send me the missing piece but instead I opted to send the pump back. I really didn't think, from the size of the pump, it can do a good psi, but that is just from the feel of it."
1,Did not like this pump,"The clip to clip the hose to the pump is positioned wrong. The method for mounting to the frame doesn't work for a smaller frame bike (I'm only 5'6"" and ride both 50 and 52 frames).Although I've had other good Topeak pumps, I wouldn't recommend this pump to anyone."
2,"Great pump, terrible mounting bracket","This pump is awesome. It has obviously been thought through, as it is very easy to use and you can get very high PSI for a hand pump.The equipment that comes with it for mounting to your bike frame, however, is terrible. Basically, you pop the pump into a plastic bracket, and then secure with a piece of velcro. The velcro has maybe a 1/4"" by 1/2"" amount of contact area. Not surprisingly, after riding around like this for a while, the velcro starts to come loose and then it's just a matter of time before your pump comes flying off of your bike.If you absolutely want a frame pump, I'd recommend this one--but expect to have to buy your own mounting equipment. Personally, I've just started using cartridges."
2,Pump works well. Mount insecure.,"Gauge is pretty accurate. Pump works well. However, the mount is useless. Lost the pump on the first long ride - on PAVED roads."
1,Really a bad product. I the amount of air it pumps is really small,Really a bad product. I the amount of air it pumps is really small and the short length of the hose is also not convenient.The food rest tab at the bottom is also too freaking small.I would not recommend this product to anyone. I will return this product.
4,Great for a small carry on pump,"Really glad I chose this one, 4 stars because the gauge is hard to read but it pumps up my 75psi bicycle tires no problem."
3,Gets the job done.,"This is by no means a replacement for a floor pump. It is not easy to use above 100 pounds, so road bikers may have some trouble. I bought this purely out of need, and for the amount of time I need it, the pump is fine although I often wish I had my floor pump."
4,Fantastic pump with a slightly inaccurate gauge,"I bought this pump after damaging a stem with my old hand-pump, which didn't have a hose.This pump has been a near-perfect upgrade with its mini-stand and hose attachment making it easy to get my Gator Hardskin tires up to 90-100psi. The included mounting hardware is nice because it allows for either screwing it to your bike's usual mounts or for attaching to the frame with the included zipties.My only gripe is that the pressure gauge is about 10psi lower than my other gauges--maybe the other ones are in the wrong?"
3,Not Like My Father's Pump,"I dented the tube of my previous version of the Road Morph with built-guage (several years old) and had to replace it. The newest version, sadly, doesn't appear to be as large or as well made. Although I can't do a side-by-side comparison, the newest version seems to take longer to pump up a tire. Finally, the mounting hardware on the older version allowed you to easily transfer the pump from one bike to the next - it was housed in a cradle secured by Velcro straps that was designed well. I pitched the newest storage system in the bottom of a drawer. Hopefully, I won't have to use it."
4,Best mobile pump I've tried,"Great little pump. It works well enough that I decided not to buy a floor pump. This performs just as well and it doesn't require much more effort than a standard floor pump. Gauge seems to be pretty accurate.A note about the presta/schrader conversion: Don't screw down the ""collar"" too tight. When you unscrew the collar holding all the pieces down, flip the insides around, and screw it back again, if you screw the collar on too tight it becomes very hard to get the chuck off of the valve when you're done pumping. I actually ripped out a valve this way. Just be sure after you do the conversion process that you only screw it on until it's fairly snug. Don't overdo it."
5,True love!,"What a great read. We start out with a husband and wife, and they are raising Imogene's sister's daughter Lou and another adopted daughter, Jeanette. Jeanette is a 16 year old girl who can't find her place in this world and is sullen most of the time. Lou is a pleasant, easy going girl. When Imo's husband, Silas dies, Imo and the girls' worlds are torn apart.Imo takes the advice of other ladies, gets a makeover and goes to the grocery store to try and pick up a man. Hilarious times! She thinks she finds love in a few places, but you will have to read the book.When Imo thinks things can't get any worse, Jeanette has a surprise for her that will send her reeling! Will they all make it through life's troubles and times? Read and find out! I don't want to miss out on these wonderful books! You won't either!"
4,I want to move to Euharlee!,"Julie Cannon has captured the flavor of small town Georgia. Her characters are believable, and the story interesting. I fell in love with Ima, Silas and the two girls. The only problem I had with the book was that the beginning was poorly edited. The ending of the book has disappointed some reviewers, but to me it just begged a sequel which has been published by now. If the other two are as good as this one Ms. Cannon will have successfully given her readers the compulsion to go out and dig their frustrations down in red Georgia clay."
3,Close to Home,In many ways this book mirrored several of our family situations and on several occassions I questioned if my mom had written it. I had hoped it would have been a more laugh out loud book but nevertheless it brought many thought provoking grins to my face. By the end of the book I was glad there was a sequel and enjoyed it as well.
3,A cute story of finding healing through gardening,"The storyline was excellent; finding healing from intense pain and grief through hardwork in the garden and from reaping your own freshly grown produce as the fruit of your labor and love. I thought the characterizations were well-developed and the descriptive writing was beautifully detailed. The style of writing was a bit hard to follow (ex: awkwardly structured sentences) and the story was poorly edited. Still, this was definitely a worthwhile reading, and I related to Imo's feelings of despair in a very personal way so the story resonated deeply with me. The abrupt ending left me feeling quite empty."
5,a really good fishing simulator,I like it. Its really fun. I wish they would make a similar game for the next gen game console. It would really improve the realism if it would give a couple hard vibrations on your controller when you get a bite. Thats when the excitement starts.
1,Impossible to program!,"Granted I'm a newbie to the whole scanner thing, but found this item impossible to program. Instructions definitely far from adequate and no where to go for help. Not worth the trouble! Bought it for my dad for Christmas and because I'd had it more than 30 days only got refunded for 80%. If in doubt, I'd stay away from this one."
1,misses the mark.,I was really disappointed with this item. It looks great in the picture. The tuning was awkward and difficult. Keep looking in my opinion.
4,Good Value,This was a good value for the price. Program instructions are not as complete and I would like to see them.
1,Don't Buy It !,"I ordered 2 of these scanners. One for myself, and one for my Father. I know I'm an old man and maybe not too aquainted with the latest technology, but the whole Idea of a scanner is to be able to listen to police and emergency calls. When I recieved my scanner, I was having a tough time programing it, so I got on the phone and did some checking. I was informed by a manager at a local Radio Shack that these analog scanners are pretty much useless anymore because of the fact that all emergency calls now broadcast on digital frequency. To make a long story short, DON'T BUY THIS SCANNER !"
4,Easy to use,"I'm not quite sure where the confusion came from from some of the other folks who ordered this. The directions are easy to follow and the input of frequencies is similar to most every other scanner. The clock and alarm features are nice. The only thing that is a little disappointing is that the backlight won't stay on, which would be useful at night. Also the clock does not come up unless you select it with the switch. To me it just makes sense to have the clock visible even while the unit is scanning frequenies. For the price, this scanner is very easy to set up and use."
5,Can't Beat it for the money,"I live in a rural community where the towers for receiving are few and far between. After much research and speaking with emergency personel, I decided upon theUniden 100-Channel Clock Radio Scanner. I was happy to see it also had a battery back-up. (Batteries not included) As a first time owner of a scanner I found it very easy to program and the instruction manual user friendly. With 100 channels I can't imagine ever using all of them. For the money I can't see how you can go wrong with this scanner."
4,Uniden 100-Channel Clock Radio Scanner,I am mostly satisfied with this scanner. The only problem with it is it locks on the wrong frequency sometimes. I think this probably happens with all programable scanners. No other complaints.Frank
4,Clock radio scanner,Uniden BC340CRS 100-Channel Clock Radio ScannerI have been very pleased with this item. I receives from places over 30 miles away without additional antennas.I would recommend it to my friends.
4,Bear Cat 100 ch. Scanner,"Verry satisified with the quality, delivery and price. The clock radio feature is something I won't use. I had another brand scanner for 2 years and it went bad. I have a 50 channel hand held Bear Cat that I have used for at least 9 years and, it still works perfectly."
2,not user friendly,"This product can be very frustrating to use, whether to scan or program. The instructions are complicated and incomplete. I gave it to my parents but they gave it back because they could not use it. Its Ok for me, but I still have to refer back to the manual (with my own notes I had to add) if I don't use it for a week or so."
2,Difficult programming,"I bought this scanner in December for a Christmas gift. It was hooked up but we couldn't get it to work. It might be programmed incorrectly or ""user ignorance"" but it has not worked at all. It is just sitting there collecting dust.I wish this was a positive review because it might not be the radio's fault. We just haven't found anyone that knows how to program them and the instructions that came with it are very vague.Again, this may not be the scanner's fault and it's not fair to give it a bad rating. The scanner may be good and the review should probably be on the lack of instructions. Nevertheless, we can't use it and it cost too much to just be sitting around doing nothing."
1,Could Work,"I guess this item could work if I could get it to. I was unable to program the unit correctly. Therefore, it is of no use to me."
4,scanner,"If you are not gonna except my review as written, then dont ask me to write anymore reviews....... Thank youy very much!"
3,PROGRAMMING,THIS ITEM WORKED AWSOME IT WAS HARD TO GET PROGRAMMED TO OUR LOCAL CHANNELS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE ITEM
2,Scanner Operation,"We got one channel to work on our scanner, with a police officer trying to set channels. Not happy with it"
5,Fantastic Scanner,"It picks up all frequencies programmed and the alarm and radio work great too. The light works great too. Makes a nice radio for your nightstand and if when you hear sirens you can see what is going on in your neighborhood. Easy to program, easy to use. I highly recommend Uniden!"
1,Falsely advertised,"Bought this radio from West Coast Mall only to discover it can't receive TV audio per the item description; in fact it can't receive any digital broadcasts. I returned it to West Coast Mall and only got a partial refund. West Coast Mall would'nt refund the shipping and return shipping fees, plus they charged a 10% restocking fee! If the product description is false and you buy the product from West Coast Mall it's ""buyer beware"". ""Fool me once, shame on me""."
1,RIGHT NOW VERY DISSAPPOINTED,I NEED TO FIND OUT WHO CAN SET THIS UP FOR ME; I WAS UNABLE TO GET IT TO SCAN. IT WAS A GIFT FOR MY DAUGHTER AND SON N LAW--MY DAUGHTER JUST GRADUATED WITH A MASTERS DEGREE(ALREADY HAS HER BACHELORS); WE JUST CAN NOT GET IT TO SCAN. WHO CAN SET THIS UP FOR US OR HELP? IF WE CAN NOT GET IT TO SCAN WHAT IS THE RETURN POLICY??? SHE NO LONGER HAS THE BOX FOR IT--I HAVE ONE AND IT IS PROGRAMMED AND NEVER HAD ANY PROBLEMS WITH OURS. WE ARE NOT DEALING WITH UNEDUCATED PEOPLE--DIRECTIONS DON'T SEEM TO WORK! VERY DISSAPOINTED - PAID OVER $100 FOR AN ITEM WHICH ISN'T WORKING.
2,Be warned,"Don't bother buying this type of scanner, especially if you are intending to monitor police frequencies, as most agencies have moved to digital radio. This scanner will not pick up that type of signal, and is basically obsolete."
1,Big disappointment,"I bought this book because of the great reviews and I am very disappointed with it. I was particularly interested in the Pastry and Yeast Breads sections: I was expecting a lot of good tips and a few basic recipes. In the pastry section the author gives general descriptions of pastry types, choux, puff pastry and phyllo dough, information easily available on the internet, and offers only one recipe for Pear Baklava. The bread section is even worse: nothing new in the description of the breads and 2 recipes for white sandwich bread and whole grain wheat bread. She forgot all the other kinds, from french to focaccia or pizza. I am sorry to say that I found this book useless and highly overrated. Not recommended."
5,most used cookbook in my kitchen!,"As a frequent baker, I am always searching for recipes that create wonderful cakes with great ease. Sarah's book is a blessing! I can honestly say that I haven't had a failed recipe. Sarah makes sense of all those rules of baking, and it's much more fun and relaxing for me. My copy of her book is splashed with butter and chocolate and who knows what else..a sure sign of a well-loved cookbook. Thank you Sarah for the great book!Kelley Farrell"
2,ROCK MAN?,"Boston meets BulletBoys for UNICEF?,even in the 80's the Tom scholtz Rockman wasn't the coolest guitar sound. but, it has it's moments if you like that kinda bleach blond bimbo metal (see Inside picture) tooo funny! That being said , I Like Carmine Appice. Great Rock drummer. i'm glad he stopped this and went into Blue murder with John Sykes. so I give it 2 stars and one star for Carmine. but subtract a star for that damn Rockman!! GULP!"
1,They have GOT to be kidding,"The manufacturers (and most of the reviewers) have got to be kidding. This flimsy littly piece of material isn't absorbent at all. I washed my hair, wrung it out, then slipped on my hair turban. Kept it on as long as I would a regular towel, and.... NOTHING. Sopping wet hair. I got my sister to try it and she thought I was playing some sort of joke on her. Useless, useless, useless. I'd give it zero stars if I could."
5,Very great belt to help my toddler feel like a big boy,"5 Star Rating for this fire truck belt.The price is higher than I would have expected for a child belt but the design is amazing. My son can put it on and off himself which really boosts his self esteem. Not to mention since he is so thin keeps his pants from falling down.Also, the company is very user friendly and the attractive colors and images can't be beat."
5,Dog Show Crack,"Bought this at a dog show vendor. If I'd have known how much the dogs would love it, I'd have bought lots more than I did. And so, here I am, hunting it down...We used it for Nationals week and constantly went back to it for dog show bait. Super easy to break into very tiny pieces and the dogs can't resist it."
4,Sharp but tip broke off.,"I had the paring knife for over a year. The blade is high carbon and soft so its easy to sharpen. The handle has the poly... which provides a good grip. A few months ago the tip broke off, so I had to round it off with a 200 course sharpening stone. Would I recommend this knife? For those who do not care too much about knives, definitely. The knives are made in Japan, and the blade retains its edge. For those who must have a Global or high end knife, you know that one knife to pass to your grand kids, this is still a good buy, but doubt it will last that long. It still a handy knife to have if you need that extra one. With proper care, this knife should give several years of use."
4,Hot Potatoes!,Hot Potatoe syle! We used this for a Pirate themed birthday party game. It was a HUGE HIT!
4,"Wonderful little book, for when the 80's become vogue again.","This is a wrly insightful and funny book of anecdotes and wisdom about the market and investors strange ways, just before the Wall Street 80's 'Masters of the Universe' ethic grew and emerged. A re-read now shows how little investors and their advisors have learned."
2,Filter smells awful for 2 weeks,"I find it odd that Blueair goes through the trouble of making their machines all metal which is great for MCS sufferers yet their filters have an obvious chemical smell that takes 2 weeks to dissipate.In the meantime I have trouble breathing. I also see tons of dust in my room even though I leave the machine on 24 hrs a day.I do like the soothing noise it puts out so basically I have a great white noise machine!Come on, Blueair, make your filters nontoxic."
5,Blueair is great!!,They seem to do a good job at filtering the air--much less dust. They are a little expensive but I guess you get what you pay for!!!!!
5,excellent in all ways!,"this was a great deal! good price, sent quickly, and was perfect in all ways! can't get better than this!!!!"
3,it's a filter,"It's a filter. nothing special. 3 star because my phillips filter costs 1/3 of this and work just the same.Also the phillips one is truly inaudible at speed 1. and the description does not have things like ""Exceptional filtration - 99.97% at 0.1 micron on Speed One"" ...does it mean with blueair as soon as i move the speed to max it will blow all those 0.1m stuck in the filter while it was at speed 1 back into the air?...anyway, have to keep buying those otherwise my expensive filter became useless"
5,A great filter for a great air purifier,"We have owned the Blueair 205C for 6 months and just replaced the filter. This air purifier is fantastic. I only wish we could afford a bigger one. You can move this unit anywhere in the house, a bathroom, kitchen, bedroom, anywhere you need some fresh air and WOW! It really works. The filter traps dust, pet dander, odors, you name it.A product that really does what it says! The allergy doctor suggested this kind of air purifier and we love it."
4,Not a bad 2nd VCR,"This one really does rewind fast! I have not had any problems with this VCR at all. I own one myself, and I just bought one for my daughter for her birthday, and I'm sure she'll like being able to rewind it so fast. Now she doesn't have to wait as long to see her favorite video."
4,Why spend more,"I dont know what I'm missing but I have no idea why anyone would spend more money than this for a VCR. This does everything I could think of (well no VCR+ - but do you really need that?). It is small, plays great, is quiet and has nice sound. If you need a VCR just buy this one and be done with it."
4,Allright.,"We bought this VCR and have been using it since 2001, to add to the other comments, the feature I like the best, is you don't have to hit Power-off to get a program recorded, any VCR I owned previously would not do so unless it was turned off. This one, it goes as long as you're not playing a tape or already recording something. Good for living with people without a appreciation for electronics, or a basic understanding, basically it'll record as long as you have enough room on the tape. Believe me, this is important livingwith somebody who's scared of the Cd player."
4,Finbar Wright Opera Concert,"This video is a bit different than I expected from Finbar.I like him better on ligher material as on Irish Folk songs. However,he has a superb voice and can handle Opera with equal ease. He is the top Irish tenor singing today and we d,ont get enough of him. The sound recording on this video left something to be desired, as it kept fading in and out.Looking forward to more."
3,"Bland, But Acceptable",I bought this one on the recommendation of a friend. I am not too fired up about it as my friend was.
3,could use some improvements,"While its definitely a good protector for your beloved Q, it pretty much strips away the form factor. I'll probably get one of those silicon sleeves instead at some point.Also, while I can live with a homely case, Ive noticed that the opening for the keyboard and the usb port arent exactly thoughtfully designed. The usb plug just barely fits with the case on, and when you jam it in there, its a little crooked, which makes me worry about bending delicate pieces in the port. The hole for the keyboard itself should also be a little bigger, so that the top buttons are a bit more accessible.My final verdict is that its a livable, functional case, but not my first choice anymore."
4,A Great Alternative Compilation,"This is a great compilation of hits and misses and should have beens.At a low price,it's well worth buying for any even casual Hollies fan.Among the hits are ""I'm Alive"" and ""The Air that I Breathe"",but,it's the non-hits and album tracks that are the finds here.""Russian Roulette"" is a simply flawless stab at a harder-edged sound that they flirted with in the late 70's.""4th of July,Asbury Park""(Sandy) is a better version of his song than Springsteen ever was capable of recording.""I'm Down"" is a vocal masterpiece with the story of an adoptive child's emotions there for all to hear.Some of the early songs,""Too Much Monkey Business"",""It's In Her Kiss"" and ""Fortune Teller"",to name a few, are great Hollies versions of British Beat Band standards of the early to mid 60's.All in all it's a great collection,at a truly great price,of some songs that you don't hear every day coupled with some great hits from the most successful British Invasion band to come out of Manchester."
3,The Hollies: Finest,"Overall, the tracks from the 2 cd are okay. Has my favorites like Bus Stop, Carrie Anne and I'm a Rock. I guess I have to listen more to it to be familiarize with the other songs as well. It's more of ""quantity"" than ""quality"" songs that I really liked."
4,Strange,Excellent graphics!Way too cool moves.Did Ayane dye her hair purple?Bass Armstrong sure has some major arm mussel.Brian Wong has very strange moves.
3,Superb graphics but nothin else special,"I played DOA2 hardcore for my good ol PS2, and that was as good as PS2 graphics got, now the game moved to the most powerful System on the market the Xbox, and the graphics are ooh-myyy goodness the best, until Splinter Cell came out, but the only thing I find wrong is after you get past the graphics and beat the game with everyone, It's pretty much a Better graphics more characters version of DOA2 hardcore, and I don't like a seem-like port of a good game, but hey, I still like the game, it just don't seem like a true sequal, just like Tekken 4, but anyone with a Xbox, and never played DOA2, then this is the fighting game 2 git. If u have I suggest a rental, and that is something I didn't do, but it's one of the Xbox's best showpicies"
4,Dead or Alive 3 - not as great as i thought it would be,"this is game is great, don't get me wrong but i guess it just doesn't strike a fancy in me... true i have never been a fan of the fighting genre, but this game is just not all i thought it was gonna be. i recommend this game to anyone with an xbox, and who is a fan of fighting games, but for anyone else, this is probably just a renter."
2,Pretty but shallow,"This game became boring after two hours. The graphics are great the shallowness and laughable plot detract too much. The endings are visually impressive but again, are so absurd that I couldn't help but laugh (although ""Christy's"" ending was interesting). Two player was OK, but it doesn't get more involved than the usual button mashing.Rent it and don't waste your money (besides, Tecmo already sold a million copies, they don't need the business)."
1,What a single player bust,"I bought the game, never played Dead or Alive before and beat the game in story mode with difficulty of normal in twenty minutes.As a two player fighting game, nothing comes close."
2,wOw!!..another fighting game,"Yeah, the game looks tight..but fighting games get old once you beat them with all the fighters..what's new?"
2,A stupid button smasher,"DOA3 looks great, it's graphics are incredible...and if that was all it took to make a great game this would be one, however, that is NOT all it takes.There are a lot of moves to learn in this game; all of which are nearly useless: because by the time you've entered the button sequence your opponent has mashed you into the floor with stupid button smashing, rendering all your hard work useless. Eventually the player always comes back to simple punch and kick combos, making gameplay completly without depth.Then there's the story and endings...hardly any of which have a point or even make a little sense.The only reason I give this two stars instead of one is because it's enjoyable to change the female characters cloths and look up their dresses when their throwing high kicks.If your a more serious fighting gamer who enjoys utilizing a characters moves and combos, go somwhere else; DOA3 is almost a pure button smasher."
1,like watching a porno film,I mean really half naked woman and very sexy clothes. It's a video game for god sake. I really don't like it and if you like porn go ahead.
3,Only for the weak-minded,"This is a great looking game visually, but if you think this is the reason to buy a [pricey] system, then you are wrong. Gameplay-wise, this has nothing much to offer and people need to realize that they are being sucked in by the Microsoft-hype-machine."
1,Xbox should have let Gamecube take the third DEAD OR Alive!,WHy? the first 2 were AWSOME! This one (is just bad)!! I beat it at the (...)Store!! Gamecube is BETTER! XBOX (is bad). It looks like Dead or alive 3 is DEAD!
4,They nailed their target demographic,"I like the game, but admittedly it is not overly deep. They have a great graphics engine, and beautiful characters, but you can get away with a lot of button mashing. I believe most of the game designer's energy went into making sure (...) that the female characters underwear looks right from all angles. A good game for people that aren't good at fighting games, but probably a rental for most."
4,Lets get it on,"I've owned Dead or Alive 3 ever since it hit the markets awhile back. This game is fairly entertaining but too simple for a guy like me. I enjoy tough games that take awhile to beat, but this game is easy. You choose your character and go through and fight the same evil guys over and over, until you get to the last evil guy (which is like a fire guy or the devil) then you kill him and you have beaten the game with that character. Very repeatative and starts to get boring. I have beaten the game with all the characters on hard mode. There are some positive things as well. The movies you obtain after beating the game are awesome. The gameplay is smooth and can be very fun at times. You get a movie for every character and I also have to say the graphics or outstanding."
5,IF YOU DON'T OWN THIS GAME... YOU ARE NOT COMPLETE!,This is an absolute MUST HAVE Xbox game... The graphics are absolutly gorgeous and the movements are spot on...This simply cannot be beat... It is the ONLY fighting game worth owning on Xbox...I rate this 6 out of 5 its that good...
4,Tekken has met it's match,If you liked the tekken series you love this one even more.This is all about speed & power and the graphics are awesome!!!
3,Dead or Alive 3 for XBOX,"What up? Xbox is awesome and it definately displays its awesome graphics in this game. However, the controls are really hard, in my opinion; I liked it better for dreamcast..."
3,Ben- 20 Years Gaming Vet,"One of the best games, graphically, I have seen. I think you will have more fun playing this four player rather than against the computer. I would buy it again. Tecmo could have done better with the grab function on here. Sometimes it is a toss-up as to who gets the move; you or your opponent. If you like fighting games, cop this 100."
3,DOA3:OKAY NO REPLAY VALUE BY: Gamemaster Jason,"D0A3 was one of the first XBOX games I got. I already had GC, ps2 and gba, so I wanted to try the XBOX... With it, I got a couple of games, including DOA3 a few days later. It was really good at first, but after I had dominated the too short story mode with about every character, I started to get bored. After a while, I started only using DOA3 when freinds were over for multiplayer madness, but that did not work well either. ...All I have to say is that it is your choice to get DOA3, since some people have different but sometimes wrong veiwpoints..Graphics:4sound: 2Gameplay: 1 (XBOX CONTROLLER STINKS)Satisfaction: 2Overall score: 3 (Not averaged)-Gamemaster Jason"
3,Solid Fighting Game,"I really enjoyed DOA3, the fighting system is amazing, the graphics are outstanding! But I got the game yesterday, and I have already beaten the story mode with every character! The game is much too short. I know there are other game options besides the Story mode, but one would expect the story to be the bulk of the game, and well, it isn't."
2,Great graphics but...,"...how come none of the fighters can jump? I love fighting games along the lines of Mortal Kombat - doing flying jump-kicks and such. All the fighters in this game are stuck to the ground. It's a fine game otherwise, but I gave it only two stars because I never feel the desire to play it. Wait for Mortal Kombat coming out in the fall for a GREAT fighting game. At least, I hope it will be."
4,Great Graphics,The graphics in this game are incrediable. I played this game for hours. The movement of the characters is very good. Sometimes it looks like you hit the person but it doesn't do anything. Once you learn the controls. It is a good game to purchase.
4,Good game,This game has great graphics almost look like dead or alive for the 360 in fact the only problem with this game is I beat it in 10 mins its that easy on single player but good game for the most part ..
3,DOA 3 Somewhat dissapoiting,"When I first heard DOA 3 was coming out I had high expectations for the game since the previous game DOA had impressed me with gorgeous graphics, an amazing soundtrack and a smooth fighting system. When I first played DOA 3 it looked just like DOA alive 2 until you actually start fighting. The feeling is just not the same. Sure there are more characters and new locations, but it doesn't take away from the fact that the fighting system sucks"
4,Very nice for $20,"This game is a very nice fighing game for the Xbox. The nice crisp graphics make the characters come to life. Also the movements of the fighters look very realistic in every way you could think of a real martial artist moves like. The levels of the game aren't just a background, it is more interactive than you think in most fighting games. You can punch people out of walls of high buildings or off a cliff into another part of the level. You can also hit people into walls or other objects to make your blow more effective. This is the best fighting game there is on Xbox, it's only $20 because it's been over a year and DOA Online is coming out January 2004. This is the fighting game that can last you a long time."
3,eye want candy,"3.5 stars...very shiny, me likey shiny. ""show your muscle"" graphics make up for lack of character concepts (visual and fighting style) in this entertaining but a fighter is still a fighter launch. lacking the imagination of the tekken series or bushido blade leave this game mostly for the fighter @ heart and great for gaming with friends."
4,"Fun, but not great",The fighting is fun but it gets old after a while (this could be said about many fighting games) I prefer Tekken.
5,Awesome,"The game is awesome - a must have for any xbox owner1. The graphics are breathtaking, perhaps one of the very few games that does justice to xbox2. There's plenty of variety- you keep getting to know new features that keep you glued."
1,"Save Yourselves, wait for Tekken 4","Alright, that's enough people, wait for Tekken4 VF4, or even Soul Calibur2 no matter how long it takes. It's worth the wait."
4,Good Graphics but lots of errors,"I don't think that the playability was that great. If one fighter got an advantage then it is hard to make a comeback. Even though the characters look amazing, it still does not make up for the fact that it is hard to learn. Some characters are so lame, like Brad and OMega. Whats up with them? How about Donovan, who is he. The story mode is pretty cool and so r the graphics."
3,Not that big of a deal.,"This game is surely the best fighting game ever put out on a console...but after I bought it I realized something, how many fighter games do we need until it is enough? The game is a lot of fun if you have several friends over and you play tournament style, but otherwise it is just a really good fighting game with excellent graphics."
4,Great Showpiece But not much more than DOA2,"DOA is a visually beautiful game. The characters are almost too lifelike and the backgrounds are beautifully drawn. Unlike other games where the backgrounds are of little consequence, the backgrounds is this game can sometimes prove to be your greatest weapon. The fighting system is very much intact from DOA2 Hardcore for the PS2 but doesn't go beyond it. It plays exactly like DOA2, which isn't a bad thing but I would have like to see as much work done on the game engine as the graphics. I'm also dissapointed in the lack of costumes but according to Gamespot, Tecmo is releasing an add-on that will incorporate new outfits and features. I fully recommend DOA for fans of the series or those looking for a fighter on the XBox. Just don't look for more gameplay than had existed in DOA2."
3,Anxiously awaiting Tekken 4,"Well this is undoubtedly the best looking game I've seen. The attention to detail in the huge levels is astounding and the characters look great. Unfortunately it's not as good as it looks. The first thing I did was play in Story mode without looking at any of the moves in the manual. I was able to beat the game with the majority of the characters, simply by employing button-masher tactics. The last boss is extremely lame, and so patterned and predictable you just want to shut the machine off and watch TV for a challenge. Overall it's an incredible launch title, it leaves me excited about the future of the Xbox, but overall this game seems a bit hollow."
3,Where are the Dads?,"This book is thorough and clear, printed in a black and white coloring book format. The text is wordy, suitable for school-age kids with reasonable attention spans. Hyperactive children or those under about 5 would find it too long.I was concerned that there is no mention of fathers in the book at all. As such, it reinforces the idea that fathers do not matter, and that they have no responsibility toward their children."
2,Golf Pride DD2 grips,The golf grips are inconsistant between one another. Some have a softer feel and some have a harder feel. I am very disappointed with the feel.
5,Really pretty once completed,"This is a really pretty cross stitch. Just the right size too. Medium difficulty due to the variety of colors, but perseverance will pay off. It was a gift for a friend. Definitely worth the time investment to complete this."
2,ick.,"""Four erotic tales inspired by the sensational television series."" Eh. Definitely erotica, not romance.There's a bit of an ""oooh, look how very daring we are!"" feel to it, kind of like an adolescent boy with a Victoria's Secret catalog.Quite possibly my ""ick"" reaction to this one is that I didn't find any of the situations very sexy: Two-timing, adultery, causing a car crash... sorry, not my kink. At all.So I'll freely admit that YMMV, with the caveat that if I EVER read the phrase ""steaming gash"" again, the offending book will be hitting the wall."
5,The definitive book on the subject,I expected a superior book because the Knous's background is so impressive on the subject of railroadiana. But I was surprised to find that it was not only a superior book but also a beautiful book as well. The pictures make identification of valuable objects much easier than with just text alone. And they make the book such a pleasure to browse through. Definitely destined to become the definitive book on the subject. I recommend it highly.
1,This book has a volume number,"This book has a volume number - it is one of a series of monographs that have been published. I am looking volume 231, but since you don't mention the volume number I don't know if this is the volume I'm seeking. I will go elsewhere for my purchase."
5,Solid clipping performance,I used to clip a horse with Cushings disease with an Oster A5 - took me about 3 hours and it would wear out a titanium blade. Bought this one and can noe do it in less than an hour. Have clipped her three times with the same blade without any degradation in performance yet. Should have bought this long ago. It can be a bit difficult for the finer details on legs and head so you may want a smaller clipper as a supplement for that.
4,"Good Book, But I Wish It Was a Bit Bigger","Wide variety of London spaces from different designers in different locations. The photos are very good, but I wish there were a few more of each flat. (There are an average of about 7 pages per flat). And keep in mind that the pages aren't very big. Of course, you can tell that from the book's size description.All in all, good for getting a flavour of modern London design."
2,Misses the boat,I was surprised how often this book breezed by the important cultural aspects of island life. It read more like a promotional brochure rather than a personalized account of what you'll see. It needs more photograhs. The Oahu section was the one that I liked the best.
1,a typical hebrew messianic hommage and nothing else,"another typical hebrew book that proclaims their fanatical nature and egoism as the supreme nation of their true and only god yahve.pitty,that hebrew ""cosmotheory"" rules the world today!"
2,Be warned!!!!!,"This should never have been released. Two of the finest, most charismatic dancers in the world at the time this was taped, captured in some of the poorest lighting, fuzzy images and distorted sound imaginable! It looks like a pirated edition except it was shot from several different camera perspectives. Add to this, or rather subtract, minimalist, almost non-existent scenery and you get an idea of what you don't get. Too bad Ekaterina Maximova and Vladimir Vasiliev had not fled Russia with their compatriots! Truly, a disappointment. I had such high hopes for this!"
2,Prokofiev - Romeo & Juliet with Galina Ulanova,"I did not notice, pre-purchase, that this was produced several decades ago.The art of dance is there, obscured by the very poor music recording, bad video, and lack of editing."
3,Not what I was expecting but its ok,This towel is way smaller than I thought it was going to be. It does do a good job of soaking up excess water from my hair but it needs to be bigger. I like my microfiber turban better.
5,Fobus is a winner every time!,"Just got this Roto holster for my wife's Ruger KP95PR. It has been a pain to find a holster that will work with the ""with rails"" model of this handgun. We searched high and low trying to find this holster (there are 2 other holsters that show they fit the P95, but they only fit the without rails version).The holster performs great in all situations. I have a Fobus for my XD40 that I wear daily and can't believe how comfortable and low maintenance it is!. I love that I don't have the creaking noises of a leather holster!You can't go wrong with a Fobus holster. If its good enough for Mossad and the IDFI guess it's good enough for me!"
2,I guess it depends on what you want,"If you are a teacher or are homeschooling your kids, this is a good educational game. If you are just looking for a fun game, this 'aint it. My kids were pretty bored with it by the time we were about half way through. Actually, so was I."
4,"Streamlight quality, but could be brighter","This flashlight is built like a tank; it is MSHA certified for use in areas with methane in the air, so it's the perfect flashlight to keep around if you are a professional who often find him/herself in a dangerous location.The version I tested has a Xenon bulb, and produces a fairly bright yellow light. The light is nowhere near as bright as from most >1Watt LED lights out there, and Streamlight does make an LED version of this lamp.The clip is sturdy, and a ring is included to hook a lanyard to it.I only spent $12 on mine, and that is about the most I'd be willing to pay for a non LED flashlight, but if you need a flashlight with specifcations like this, then the usual price is certainly worth it."
4,3 cell light,Great flashlight. Use for firefighters. Need to check batteries often. Had some go bad an ruin flashlight. Had to throw them away and get these new ones.
2,"Looks nice, performs OK","I like that the flashlight seals well for dirty environments, but it's just not that bright. I expected the 10 LEDs to put out a super bright beam, but I compared it to a 3D cell Maglite and the Maglite is so bright it totally overpowers the Streamlight beam. I would not buy this one again... I'd just get another Maglite."
2,caution,I really liked this product until I found my 6 1/2 month old son ripping small pieces off the jigsaw-like edge. These pieces are small enough to be a choking hazard and I have had to get rid of this product because of this.
3,CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING,"This game has a very high potential,but refuses to use it. The violence,sex, and scandal used in today's bestselling video games is very unessesary. Of course,though,this game is a fine work of art which truly deserves five stars.Tis very complex,interesting,and entertaining. You at full comand.But the game is very unaproppiate. I reccomend it for sane, mature peoples. Just remember,it is rated 'M'for mature.Thank you,I hope this information was of help to your choices."
4,Grand Theft Auto 3,"This is a great game.. but the hurtin thing about it, is that there is no IMPORT car like HONDA PRELUDE and all those awsome car. It be even better if there's MAGS and BODYKIT on the car"
3,"Fun, but [...] sick..........","This game is very fun, but is just a little too........how should i say this.....er....well i suggest you should be abstolutely sure that your parents won't go crazy and ground you if they find what is in this game.(everyone under 17 that is). I also regret to inform you that GTA3 is not being made anymore. So eventually it will disappear from the shelfs. But seriously people, if you want to go low with a game (such as games with many adult themes, mild language, and animated blood gore etc...), this is pretty low, i mean very low. Its fun, but you walk away feeling dirty. To think this game is second in selling standings......."
5,Grand Theft Auto - What's better?,"I bought the game Grand Theft Auto 3 and I can't think of anything that I don't like! Well maybe one thing and that would have to be how your always trying to find Portland, Staunton Island, Shorside Vale, ect., ect. All I know is that this game is very violent, they have very foul language, and kids who are not mature should not have this game."
5,One of the best storylines in a video game to date!,"The storyline of this game is one of the best I've ever played. Its up there with FF7, FFX, and many other greats. It does take a while to get to other islands during missions, and makes missions with time limits very hard, but if you know your way around the cities, you shouldn't have any problems."
4,"Good, But Vice City Is Better.","Well when i first bought my PS2 this was the first game got the same day i got the PS2, and i liked it. But Then A few games later i got Vice City and that is way cooler. GTA3 does Have a good story line and a few good radio Stations, but over all i would have to say get VC insted. But i dont want to be totaly dissing GTA3 because it is a good game. So My Best Guess Is ready the reviews for this game and VC and decide for yourself. (Eventhough we all know what you will buy)"
4,why GTA 3 rules,"To really get the best side of GTA 3 is enter armor codes and weapon codes. Than just wonder around, not on a mission, and see how many wanted stars you can get. What could be more fun in a video game than standing on an overpass blowing up police cars, shooting pedestrians, and throwing granades at big crowds of people down below. And than there's 'borrowing' cars. There are so many different types of cars. You could get a cheetah, the fastest car in the game, a banshee, the second fastes car in the game, or a mule, a big heavy truck, the slowest vehical in the game. You can even listen to the radio when you're in the car. All in all, with all the things you can do, the weapons yo can get, the missions you go on . . . It rocks!!!!"
3,This game is ok,"Everything about this game is pretty fun, however it gets old pretty quick. Its no as good as everyone thinks it is."
5,One of the Greatest PS2 games out there,"Absolutely one of the greatest games of 2001. I am a total supporter of all Rockstar games. I own GTA3, Max Payne,Smuggler's Run, and can't wait for State of Emergency to come out. GTA3 may not offer the amount of graphics like Final Fantasy X or Metal Gear Solid 2 may have, but who the hell cares! The rumors that surronded GTA3 about how it was going to be taken off the shelf and reedited are a bunch of .... The only place taking it off the shelf is Australia so that means in America you can get the game raw and uncut. Summary: The game kicks butt and you should own it!"
4,"Awesome Game, But Watch Out For Used Discs.","Grand Theft Auto III is a great game, filled with action & cars, cars, cars. You just run around Liberty City & complete missions. If you like a more laid-back type of game, this is definitely for you. But, just be cautious when you buy a used disc. I bought GTA III used in ""lightly scratched"" condition & when I got it, the disc had very heavy lines on it, & I had to buy a used disc from a local gaming store because I couldn't play it because of the condition of it."
4,GTAIII,"This is like a much funner version of the MySpace game Mobsters. GTAIII you can drive fast cars, run over ppl with the cars lol, you can beat random ppl up on the streets, steal their money and weapons. Do special missions to get in good with the big dawgs of the game. It's cool!The further you go into it, the more difficult it gets. But who doesn't love a good challenge huh? Get dis game and go help Tony, badabing!!"
4,GTA III Rocks,I love GTA III. I just recently got a PlayStation 3 and even though this is a PS 2 game it plays fine. I'd recommened this game if you like a lot of action.
5,GTA3 is the game to play!,"This is probably the reason you're gonna want to buy a playstation. It has hours of gameplay, tons of cool glitches, fun missions, and so much more. If you explore the game enough you'll find hilarious glitches. The funniest (but gross) one is finding a guy by the stadium in a trench coat with a notebook. Kill him and look at his notebook and see what he drew. It's the funniest thing. Anyway, the only bad thing about the game is if you hit someone the cops are beating you up and if someone else hits you the cops are still beating you up. But the game is probably one of the best that I have played. The missions are fun and the graphics rock! There are a bunch of different people on the street and gangs to fight. There are 3 different cities to explore and the drive-bys are awesome. The sounds are hilarious when you run someone over too lol...PLAY THIS GAME!"
5,A New Era In Auto Games,"Grand Theft Auto III is by far one of the most exciting games I have ever played in my gaming life. There has never been another game before that can match up to GTA3. The game is just loaded with so many missions in which strategy and logical thinking is involved. Every mission has its well thought of plot and there's a different way of completing every mission. GTA3 is also loaded with excellent graphics I know you'll love. If your into fast cars and grand theft, then this game is definately for you. this game is totally tricked out...fast cars...fast guns...car chase...races...and a whole lot of action that keeps your adrenalin flowing. There's not much I can tell you about this game because its SO GOOD...you'll be speechless! Don't Just Take My Word 4 It...Try it Out Yourself...I Promise You Won't REGRET It!"
5,fun lovin criminal,"i played this game and as i expected it is the best game for playstation 2 yet, that is if you like pointless voilence in a game.the graphics were great, the dialogue of the citizens walking around the city is very funny, too.this is a must have for the ps2!"
5,cool game - but be careful...,"... if you like a good night sleep....I never played videogames in my life, and have not played a pc game in years - until i came across GTA3 -ultra-violent, not too difficult if you [stink] at viedogames like I do -keep it away from your kids and neighbors though - it's tough, but a lot of fun.If you are busy at work like me you might want to chose another activity on a sunday night - I was so hyper that I could not go to sleep after playing for a couple of hours....."
5,The Best Play Station 2 Game Ever!,"First thing you got to give them 5 stars for the enginuity and 5 for the gameplay. This game is so addictive you'll be playing for hours. In the game you get to shoot, steel, and cause chaos throughout the Liberty City."
1,This game ...,"This game is horrible with tons of unneccisary killing.Graphics:4/10: The guys are all blocky. Not nearly what it was made out to be.Sound:9/10. Okay. I have to give it props on it's more than great voice acting but that does not redeam this horrible game.Story:3/10: Go around and blow people up. This game focus's way more on killing than stealing cars.Replay:4/10. It's all the same. Steal, shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot shoot Steal shoot shoot etc.Characters:3/10. Brainless stupid, evil people.Pros:Great voice actingCons:Lots of evil mindless slaughter.Little story.bland graphics.An insult to your intellegenceOverall fun:2/10: Buy this game if you get pleasure from watching people die cruel painful deaths. If not play a good Action adventure game like Devil may cry or onimusha."
1,A reaction to the reviews,"The reviews for this game were very helpful in helping me decide that I will NEVER, EVER, buy this game. You've got to be a sadistic fool to want to play a game like this. We won't be buying it!"
1,Grand Theft Auto 3,"As a mother of a teenage son and a legal advocate to end violence against women, I am appalled at your decision to distribute and market this video as a,""game"". This video awards points for killing a prostitute although the the poor player loses some of his money. A woman is raped, beaten, and murdered in this country every three seconds!!!!! Your video is socially irresponsible and continues to perpetrate myths that violence of any kind is funny or acceptable. I sincerely do not believe that our founding fathers had this in mind when implimenting the First Amendment. You should be ashamed! I, nor my family, will purchase another Sony product again, or use your website. Saddened in PA."
2,grand theft auto,i didnt like it.. it was good quality.. perfectly good game.. i just didnt like it..
2,this game sort of sucks,"I wish I won the lottery, but that's for people with hope. I have hope. You'd have a better chance at....blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. That's the way it always is. PLUS YOU'D HAVE A BETTER CHANCE AT LIKING THIS!! IT IS SO BORING! I might never win the lottery just like all of those S.O.B.s who have all of it to themselves!!!!!!!!!!!! It makes me furious. Even though in the series, this game leads straight to Vice City, AT LEAST THE MAIN CHARACTER HAS A FRIGGIN' PERSONALITY IN THAT GAME!!!! I don't know yet how good San Andreas is either. The graphics for GTA 3 are just plain crappy, you don't have a code for weapons, and when you kill someone, it doesn't sound like you're trying to. Everything echoes for some reason when you go down hills of streets {shrug}. If you want a better game, play GTA VICE CITY, DRAGONBALL Z BUDOKAI, or MK DEADLY ALLIANCE. You will not only get blood, but a lot of good, fun violence."
3,GTA3 - Best Ever!,This edition of GTA is definitely the best ever. The level of detail is amazing.. each level has so much to explore. You can follow the missions or just have fun blowing things up. This game will keep your interest for a long time.
5,If you love video games BUY THIS GAME!,"Easily one of the best console games ever, GTA3 has some minor problems but it is just so FUN you can play for days straight.Yes the graphics mess up occasionaly but the gameplay is just tremendous. You can go almost everywhere and do almost everything you wish (about the only thing you cannot do is invade peoples homes to steal cash).Hopefully they will release an updated version for XBOX to fix up the minor graphical miscues, but who cares really?Five Stars A+++ Highest Recommendation!"
4,"Same old, but so bold","This game is pretty much the same as the old one, but it's just delivered in a way better format. For example, there's cut scenes that make it feel like there's more of a story instead of just random violence being played out. Also, the graphics are great and the sense of size is incredible. The city is so big and you can go anywhere. There's so many cars and when you steal cop cars, ambulances, fire trucks, taxis, etc, you can take on their jobs. It's definitely worth buying."
5,Amazing,"This game is possibly the best game that I have ever played. The detail of the city is absolutely amazing, and the missions are both fun, and intruiging. You really want this guy (do they ever say his name?) to get his revenge. The bosses are animated and often very funny, and the added part of the game where you can go and pick up people in a taxi, or put out fires. The missions are varied enough so it never gets monotonous, and this is definately the best game out now for PS2 (just don't play it in front of your 4-year old)."
5,BANNED IN AUSTRALIA,"Well, it looks like I won't get to play this game. The powers that be have just decreed it's too violent for sensitive Aussie gamers and banned it :-(The authorities out here still seem to believe that the only people who play games are 10 year old boys who have to be protected for their own good."
4,"Rich world, slow restarts","The game is a lot of fun to play. As other reviewers mentioned,it has an adolescent feel to it; costs for actions are light,and crimes literally fade away. Official missions are oftendifficult, and you can't save during them, which makes pullingoff the really tricky ones a tedious chore. Most of the missionscan be solved in multiple (sometimes unorthodox) ways, whichadds to the fun. The city is amazingly vast and detailed--justwhen you think you know it, you discover a simple tunnel or turnleads to a whole new section. Weapons use is often nonintuitive,and aiming is clunky at best. Why didn't they use the rightanalog controller or the D-pad for this? The game is extremelyviolent and realistic enough that it probably isn't suitable forkids, but it is a real treat for overage kids that just want totake out some agression after putting up with the real world."
4,I give it 4 almost 5 if i could a very good game.,"first off peaple who say this game is gorry and has hookers Well it say on the box. back to the game. This game is the best ever because you of course get to carry guns, like a 9mm-hand gun to a flame-thrower. You drive a car, and boats and more! Go on missions to earn money and respect from other mobsters. Highjack vehicles; kill enemies before they kill you, and if you like the Sopranos you will like Grand theft Auto 3 and Grand theft Auto Vice city. So will you Work for the mob, you better strew them before they strew you, And who knows you could be a criminal master mind and own your own a mob and own the city or citys. And There is so much more!!! For more information go put Grand theft Auto 3 in a search, or go to www.GrandtheftAuto.com"
3,Damn Good when it first came out.,"The night I purchased my PS2, I also purchased Max Payne, MGS2, and this. This was the first game I Played. I immediately turned up the sound on the TV, and got ready for a cool game. Thats exactly what I received. Definetely has the best storyline out of GTA 1,2, and 3. Now that Vice City is out. I recommend getting the double Pack. It includes both games for only $50 (at most stores)."
5,Great Game!,"When I first got this game it was great!! Then i got like half the game done. One day I went to play and I got my guy in that orange jump suit. On accident, I saved the game. Well you can't do any missions, at all, when wearing that suit. So, I had to start the whole game over. I kept playing that game every day, trying to get back to where I was. When I finally did, I was so happy. But then, one day I went to save the game and it froze. So, not knowing what to do, I took out the memory card and reset the PS2. That was not very smart. Because when I tried to start my saved game it wouldn't work. So, I went online to get help. I got help on how to fix the problem. A bunch of people said I would have to start over. Which was the last thing I wanted to do!! But I had to, because I love the game. And I think anyone who buys this game will love it. And no matter how many times they have to restart a game, they will stick to it to finish this great game!!"
5,The best game ever made...................................,This game kicks ___ and is really kool. Its really fun just to screw around and do the missions. its one of those games where u think its the best game ever but you can't expain.
5,best all around,"I think Grand Theft Auto 3 was an awesome game. I would highly recommend this game for a mature audience because of prostitutes and high gore. Two of my favorite cars are the hydrolic car called the Yardie Lobo and the dune buggy on the third Island. My favorite gun is the M-16.It also has radio stations, what other game has radio stations that you select by pressing a button? My favorite station is Game radio. I just beat this game and I would give it 5 stars! I have never played a game so exciting and hard. If I were you I would buy the game if you haven't already because it will most likely be sold out soon."
5,BEST GAME EVER,"This game is sweet. You get to kill bad guys, pedestrians and cops.You can also run from the police but you might get killed. They will send chopers tanks armies. Anything to kill you. The best thing you can also do is drive by shootings, being a taxi driver, policeman and a parimedic. You can drive tanks, firetrucks, sweet cars, police cars, boats and even an airplane. As I said BEST GAME EVER."
5,GTA3: Best Game Ever!,"Grand Theft Auto 3 is the best game I've ever played! The game is so original and fun, that you will be on it for hours. If your into mafia games and stuff, this is a must own. Although, this game uses very strong language, extremly violent, and a lot of sexually stuff, so parents be warned. But if your cool with that, you'll fall in love with this game. You should buy this game today."
5,Beautiful!,This game is addictive. You may very well find yourself with an impulse to play it at all times. The graphics are great and the atmosphere is vast and full of objectives. It is also a great way to relieve agression. Besides all of this it also beats the crap out of most car-based games including its predecessors.
5,Scary Good,I just got this game and was amazed by its graphic nature and subject matter. It's absolutely fantastic! You can cruise around doing whatever or earn some money doing jobs for organized crimes. There plenty of variety and this game just doesn't get boring. Must have for PS2.
1,Save your money,"Grand Theft Auto used to be such a fun game when the first title hit us a few years back, but it's become quite boring. I played with a copy of GTA 3 at a game show and was disappointed. Even though the graphics and speed have improved, I just couldn't feel excited about the gameplay. Spend your money wisely elsewhere."
1,one of the worst games ever made,"just kidding! i did that for your attention. this game should be considered a work of art. The best thing about this game is that you can do stuff that you would NEVER do. i mean, what other game can you pick up ""working girls"" in your car? that's what i thought: NONE. i rest my case, this the 2nd greatest game on the system(MGS2 is the best!)"
3,This games alrite,"Okay, the game is pretty good, but there are some things that i don't like. First, its the player models, look at them they seem like everybody has a small head and a huge body. Then there is the gameplay, the game is simple. All u do is steal cars and do favors for mob bosses. The game to me gets boring quikly and thats why i gave it 3 stars. If u like disobeying the laws and doing whatever you like, then this game's for you. But if your a true gamer that likes the story in a game rather than the flashy gameplay then stay away from this game. You'll probably just play for a little bit then let it catch dust."
1,one of the worst,"I can't belive how violent this game is, its so blah blah blah blah blah...Everybody should own this game, including children, its a fun game and funny too. I reccomend this to anyone with fingers. All the features of this game are amazing, i dont see what is so sick about it, its not REALITY, its pretend."
4,you cant do drive by's,this game is good but no drive by's now that sux but i can live with it.good game over all mindless killing.long game though.
4,[MESSED] UP BUT COOL,"IN THIS GAME YOU ACTULY GET TO WACK THE HECK OUT OF PEOPLE.NON STOP CUSING,AND REALLY VIOLENT.BUT IT IS REALLY COOL.YOU CAN NOT KILL THE PEOPLE WALKING BUT YOU CAN STILL WACK THE HECK OUT OF THEM.COOL MISSIONS,AND IT IS ALOT OF FUN TO INTRODUCE A BAT TO A GUYS FACE,THAT IS YOUR 3TH MISSION.GOOD CARS TO STELL.THE FIRST GAME I HEARD THEM SAY THE F WORD."
3,pros and cons,"This game is average. The cops in the game are only meant to take YOU down. There could be Osama Bin Laden in the street and a cop would walk right by him and say ""Was up Osama My Man!"" With you on the other hand you could be shot at and kill the guy that you shot at you and you'd get a wanted level... There could be a blown up car in the street and the drivers wouldn't know what the hell to do so they will just honk their horn! (which gets annoying!) So in other words the AI (stinks). When you first get the game IT IS AWESOME, but once you learn the songs word for word and memorize all the pedestrian sayings it gets old. On the other hand the game is fun! It has really fun missions, (my favorite is when you have assassinate the mob boss of the Leone family)Kickass guns, some really good snipers posts, some fairly good cars, and tons of pedestrians to take out your rage on."
5,Grand Theft Auto III: The Revenge,"GTA was a dissapointment. GTA 2 was a dissapointment. This was finally the best GTA and is one of the best PS2. You get to do missions for the Mafia, Yakuza, and more! You get many weapons! The only bad thing is that it influences violence. I highly recomend..."
5,wow!,This game is awsome I finally got it and it is good. The graphics are awsome and the cars are realistic.If you do not have this game you need it. But be warned this game has tons of blood and a whole lot of bad words.The missions are sorta easy except for the payphone ones. I do not see anything wrong with this game. The only thing that could be better is if it had motorcycles.I am glad Vice City is out because it has a lot of stuff GTA3 was missing.
5,There are missions? Goals?,"Hmmm... How does one write an Amazon review for this game that wouldn't be either rejected, or mutilated for content? I mean, the only way to earn points is to do illegal stuff... heck, you are working for the mob through most of the game! Most games might take away points for beating an old lady with a baseball bat... not this game, it gives you points.As you may have guessed, this game isn't for little kids... as a matter of fact, anyone with any problem differenciating reality from videogames or movies should probably stay far far away from this game. But for those of us with enough sense to realize that it is a videogame and nothing else will enjoy this game to no end."
5,Greatest game...EVVERRR!,If you are going to buy one game this year...this is the game! I spent two hours just walking around the 1st part of the city exploring. The game has incredible replay value. Just walking around and car jacking is fun.Try getting a sports car and pulling up next to a prostitute...after she gets in take her to a dark alley and see what happens.
4,Exciting game,"It is an exciting game for me, but the characters are often the same, boring duplicates, and pretty impersonal. I was hoping that the characters would be more realistic, for example, it would be even more exciting if a character was very physically expressive when talking to another( need physical facial expression like moving the mouth when talking or using facial expression physically when expressing emotions such as anger, happiness, interested, or just bored, etc.) It is not necessarily for the characters to be clones of one another. Face it, in the real world, unless we are twins or triplets, we are in fact, unique as an individual! Other than that, love the car chases, landscape and the sound!"
5,The best PS2 game I've ever played,"There's not a lot that can be said about this game that hasn't been said already. This game puts you in it's world like no other game I've played. You feel like you're really in Liberty City, as if it were a real place. A perfect example: When walking down the street, you will occasionally walk past a pedestrian singing the words from one of the many original songs from the multiple radio stations you can listen to while driving. It's little details like that which make this game truly amazing."
5,BUY IT!,This is a game that gamers in the mid-80's could only have wet dreams about as they ended their evening from playing Atari. And now that fantasy has come true and the best game ever is a reality. And it only took about 20 years.
5,"The Perfect ""Stress"" Reliever....","GTA 3 is what I call the perfect ""come home from work"" game. Example, Had a hard day at work? Pop this game in and beat people to a bloody pulp on the sidewalk. Mad at your boss? Car jack a big rig and run him or her down on the streets. Angry that a cop pulled you over coming home? Pretend that's him on the screen and make him road pizza. Better yet, steal his car and run him over with that. Feeling more constructive rather than DEstructive? Go get a job from a mob boss for some extra dough. That's the beauty of GTA 3. Do whatever you feel like doing. Not many games can offer that, but GTA 3 pulls it off perfectly with great graphics and gameplay to boot. This has to be considered one of the greatest games of the century. The police and politians won't agree, but Screw Em'!! Have fun!!"
5,Nothing But The Best!,"I almost lost my breathe when I started playing this game. Rockstar games understood how gamers felt about the first and second Grand Theft Auto so they have made the best improvement. Anything can happen in the streets of Liberty City. You can get jacked for your car also. Some people put up a fight with there car. The missions are fun to do. I play this game everyday and still havent beat it yet. I could play it forever. Not one mission gets boring. There are tons of bosses and hundreds of missions. The weapons are excellent, and the best for last, The Graphics are unbelievable. There are day and night weather and it also rains during the day. You can steal almost every vehicle in sight. I'm proud of Rockstar Gamers."
5,"Who Wanna Test This, GTA3 Rumblin and Gunnin","Alright everyone, if you have ever enjoyed anything in life you will love this game. It's packed with non stop shoot em up(including cops, pedestrians, Army men, mobsters...) action, for hours, and i mean HOURS, of game playing. You can choose to complete hundreds of kick (...)missions, or just rome the isainly large city and just rampage the town. This game is a must own for all PS2 owners. If this game was human, it would definately crush Van Damme with a lift of its finger. BUY THIS GAME."
1,youve got to be kidding me,"Youve got to be kidding me, im 14 and im against this game, how could they create such a violent thing, no wonder theres so much crime and death in the world, whats the point of wondering around shooting people you dont even know? are people that fascinated with blood and gore and death, if you play this you are a sick person and should stop playing it immediatly, any grand theft auto should be banned from every place and everwhere because if you havnt noticed, the killing percentage has FLOWN UP since this game came out, rockstar games, you are sick and the people that play this , you are a bunch of fools that are going to grow up to be nobodys, but whats there going to be after games like this destroy society , sad but true, your ruining this planet over your silly antics and ""gangster"" stupidity, would somebody somebody save me, feel free to email--dragon342@msn.com"
1,Awful,"This is a terrible game. With the recent sniper killings, I don't understand why anyone would buy this. Anyone who enjoys games like GTA 3 must be sick. I bet the sniper played these as a child. To anyone who defends this game: there is no denying that this game is violent, there is no excuse for games that promote violence, it has been proven that violent games increase the chances of someone acting violently by 24 percent. If you want to become a serial killer, this is the game for you. Somehow I don't think it is worth it."
1,SICK,"I was very excited to try this game... The reality is that this game is sick. What kind of a reflection on our society is it that we produce a game which glorifies beating old people with bats, running over cops, and shooting cops. I am not against violence per se, because we have all grown up playing cowboys and Indians, or cops and robbers, pretending to have guns and shooting each other. That has been going on since time immemorial, ever since it was cave dweller vs. bear. Many games involve shooting or death, but usually you are on some kind of quest to save the world. In this game, you are glorified for senseless acts of cruelty. I do not find this amusing or even ""funny."" After playing for a few hours, I felt dirty, as though I were committing evil. If you pretend to ...[commit crimes], that is not a good thing."
5,I think this will be the gratest game,"I just hope the developer/publisher not screw things up in the last minutes. This game has great prospect. If you like Grand Theft 2, you will like it. GTA is the ONLY game that still fun to be played while using cheat/gameshark."
5,Use proper judgement,"GTA3 is very violent. Under no circumstances should anyone under 15 play it. However, only individual parents can decide whether or not their teen has the maturity to play this game. It is a well-made and fun game capable of entertaining you. One must play the game with a firm belief that the acts being commited are evil. It's a game."
3,Is it good or bad?,"GTA3 is a pretty decent game. I don't own it, but I've played it extensivly. The graphics and the sounds are flawless. The 3D enviorment is a definate improvment from the brds-eye view of GTA and GTA2. The thing that marks it down on my rating is the general POINT of the game. Commit as much [trouble] as possible. Thats just a little, ummm...silly to me. The other thing that marked it down was the boringness. I played the game for aobut three hours. After two hours, the game got old...fast. Those are my only two complaints."
5,THE BEST,THIS IS A GREAT GAME ONLY FOR VERY X-CITE BOYS!IT'S GOT A GOOD GAMEPLAY AS WELL AS GRAPHICS!!
5,This is da best game since Super Mario but flat out violent.,"I mean,to be honest i don't have the game yet but when my cuzin brang it over i was hyped out about it. My cuz let me start myt own file and i luved the beginning when i went to a guy named Luigi. I went on my first mission and it was e-z. But things got harder. I had to hijack more cars, kill more gangsters, and pick up some important people.Here are some cons about da game:I have nuttin to sayhere are sum pros:EVERYTHING IS SO COOl.Hijack Millions of Cars.Rob innocent civiliians.Work for the mafia.And one thing that was weird was when i got to pick u the prostitutes. Whoa."
5,Get it... Now.,This is the illest game I have ever played. Do not miss the boat on this one or you will be kicking yourself for years. I'm buying it for X-mas for everyone I know who has a PS2 -- that's how good it is. No other game comes close.
4,No A.I.,"I just have one thing to say about this game that might not have been said before already: there is no A.I. When you have 3 or more police stars they can track you down anywhere, effortlessly following you through walls etc. The choppers can even follow you in the subway. Also, the traffic and pedestrians move and act in very simple patterns. Apart from that, it's a great game. Great characters, great game mechanics, great fun. The Chatterbox radio station is especially funny. ""Tony Tony Tony...."""
5,awesome game !!,"i bought this game a week ago and i really dont regret my decision ! it is an incredible game !! i've playing it the entire week and i found it amazing . the levels increase gradually their difficulty and the history is great . the graphics are pretty good, too . there are many weapons and i like the best the sniper rifle : its like silent scope , but you can move anywhere and shoot any one . excellent game .the only thing i dont like is that if you fail a mission u have to repeat all the steps , and this is especially bothering in long missions , as blow tha base"
4,i pretty good game( a 12 year olds review),i like it it is a pretty good game so i give it about a 4.3 outta 5
5,BEST game I've ever played,"WELL, I've had this game since Christmas, and I've never gotten sick of it to this day. That's all I have to say about that! = )"
4,why make games like this?,"OK this game is very ""original"" because never has a game before it reach such a high scale of violence and maturity. It is very entertaining for those who can play it as a game and not get influenced by it but unfortunately...people...will get influenced by it. Also it is not a game for kids period so adults dont buy this for your kids...It is fun to play for the rest of us...But even if i do recommend it, it is not a classic and only an entertaining game..."
5,Stress Reliever,Virtually running over people and busting out a AK-47 on a crowded street! What a great stress reliever after a hard day of work. (I meant as in the game for those of you who can't distinguish from virtually and reality) Beats using a stress ball!
4,Grand Theft Auto 3 Is Cool,"GTA 3 is cool, very fun game play, reduces lots of stress! whether your stealing some cars or sniper shooting people off of roofs this game rocks!"
5,Excellant Game!!!,This is obviosly one of the best games out for Playstation 2 right now. Nonlinear gameplay makes this a game you won't want to stop playing for months. The graphics are outstanding and the variety of cars and weapons is unbelievable.
5,What a game!,"After Mario 64 and hopefully Super Mario Sunshine, GTA3 is the best game ever. It is an action, adventure and driving game all rolled into 1. What more can you ask for? This is the kinda game that would make you buy PS2. Anyone who hasn't bought GTA3, get it now. Roll on GTA Seattle and GTA4."
2,great game ! but it glitchs alot,this would be the greatest game ever if it had not glitches .it glitches every 5 mins or sobuyer beware
4,It was good until I beat the game.,"At first when you start to play it was really fun. But after I beat the game it just seemed not that fun. There wasn't anything to do execpt ""kill"" people."
2,Overrated Game of the Year!,"I do not know about you but, I want the game to be fun and excting, not tedious and repetitive. GTA3 is just that!!! With so many missions and little sense of accomplishment, there is no real reason to play this game aside from the novelty of being mature and violent. There is some variety in gameplay and mechanics, but with horrid contols and poor camera angles, who cares!!!BreakdownVisual 4/5- Nice Looking gameAudio 3/5- Nice tunes, too repetitive thoughGameplay 1/5- Repetitive and BoringReplay Value 1/5- Yawn"
3,For Casual Gamers,"I'm not much of a Gamer. I don't play for the competitive part, but to simply have fun. GTA III is the perfect game for Gamers like myself. There's no competitive element to this game at all. I strongly recommend this game for those who play video games just to have a good time."
3,Ok game,This is an ok game but if you want a good gta game get gta San Andreas this game dosen't have the large selection of guns and it is just to easy to die on this game but it is ok and kinda fun. Thank you for reading this review and hope you found it helpful.
5,Fun but some errors...,"I don't really care for the gore because I LOVE IT!!! But the are a bunch of bad things after you do missions...Cops, they only go after you and like gangs try and kill you. Police will overrun you no matter if you have gameshark! They have tanks and the army at the last star (6th) that will run you car into ashes. Vice City has fixed some of these and you can also help police get criminals and get rewards! It's also funny to karate kick pedestrians off their motorcycles. If you like motorcycles, helicopters, boats and all that fancy stuff, then get Vice. If you like just being a killer then get GTA3. I'm 12 years old and I LOVE IT BABY!!!"
5,Best Game I ever played,"This is by far the best game I have ever played. It allows you to do everything you ever wanted in a game, pick up prostitutes, do drugs, steal cars, beat people up. On a serious note, I was in a used game store the other day and I was talking to the guy who owned the place told me a guy just came in and sold his playstation 2 with Grand Theft Auto because he was spending way to much time playing, and wasn't getting anything done."
5,The best game I've ever played.,"This game is just perfect, it combines the rpg style with a very realistic theme and history, you get involved immediatly, and it becomes harder and funnier, it is a must have game. you can drive a taxi and make bucks like that or being a fireman or a vigilante and kill criminals, or just doing favors to mob bosses or stealing prostitutes, or carjacking, hand robbing, etc. you can be as good or [bad] as you get entertained."
5,A 24 yr old woman,This game is the best. It is exciting and hours of fun. I have never been so addicted to a game.
3,A crowd pleaser that lacks depth,"At first it's really fun at first to drive around like a maniac and get into trouble, but after you've explored the city and goofed around a bit, it gets old fast. The main plot of the game is a lame and the missions are dull...GTA3 has the same idea but half the depth. It's more fun to drive around and raise heck than it was in Privateer, but gets old faster. When you make the cops mad in GTA3, they get over it when you ""die"" or bribe them off...There's times when I put the game in to just play ""Vigilante"" or run from the cops. But I'm glad I borrowed the game instead of buying it. That said I am looking forward to Vice City as apparently a lot my issues with this one are addressed in the next."
5,Finally an excuse to buy a PlayStation 2,"This game sucked me right in.The short animated movies that tell the story are visually pleasing, interesting and clever. The gameplay itself is easy enough to learn - it took just a few minutes to get the swing of it.The missions are entertaining. The 3D graphics are amazing.One of the best aspects of this game is the radio. You can switch radio stations at will, each of which plays a different style of music. I liked the reggae station best.This is indeed a violent, adult-themed game. No problem for an adult or older teen but definitely too adult for an under 12 year old (in my opinion)."
5,Coolest game ever. No question.,"I love this game and can't stop playing it. The fact that you can spend your time just causing mayhem in a completely unscripted manner is so awesome. What other game on earth could you open up with an M-16 in a crowded street, when the cops and ambulance comes you shoot them too and steal the ambulance. Of course then you end up in a running firefight with helicopters and tanks after you but that's fun too. I love the full city and how different parts open up throughout the game. The radio stations are great too. This is definately a game for mature minded people, I know kids play this but only get it for kids who understand reality vs. gameplay becuase it's pretty ""evil""."
4,"Violent, but Awesome","This game is one of the most violent and exciting games availible to the public. I couldn't stop playing this game until I beat it about 100 time's!It's option's are endless and there are over 50 vechicle's to cruise around the giant three islands in. There are so many cool weapons I actually spent two day's just shootin things at the random.It also keep's me occupied whenever I am bored. I do not request this game to anyone who is under the age of 18 because they might be influened into doing some of the stupid, but quite amusing thing's in this game."
3,Gets Boring After You Have Beaten It.,"I remember when I first played this game.I thought it was the greatest game ever made.I thought to myself ""WOW!!! I can play this game forever and never get tired of it!!!"".I was wrong.After only beating it twice,I was oficially tired of the game.The first time I played this game,I never knew what to expect.Now I know everything that happens.If I had written this review the first time I played this game,I would have given it five stars.But since I got tired of it,I only gave it three.Also,the game goes slightly downhill when the mafia missions end.If the whole game was nothing but mafia missions,I would have given this game a better rating.If you have never played this game,then you should play it because it is REALLY fun the first time.Peace Out."
3,Great game - Irresponsible polt,"I have to say GTA3 is one of the best games ever programmed. The graphics are a little cheesy but in full retrospect it was necessary to do this to achieve what Take 2 had to put on one DVD. However, I think the game is 'very' irresponsible to release to the main public, it shows images of beating people with baseball bats and stealing peoples cars. This is OK if you just play it as a game, but what about people who have bad parents and want to take their frustrations a little further. GTA3 is a bad influence (just like those kids a while back that tortured a little boy because they were inspired by the film Reservoir Dogs!!). This game is the sign of the times, I'm not a hippie or any type evangelist, but I strongly recommend to any who are thinking of purchasing this game, make sure you know yourself!!!"
5,A great way to release stress!!!,"The best way to play this game is to skip the missions and just start havoc in the city. Fight the gangs and police, attack the citizens and steal cars!! If you are able to find some of the cheat codes off the Internet, then this is where the fun really begins! These secrets can give you armor, weapons and even a tank (this is only listing a few)! As always parents, research a video game before you buy it for your 7 year old."
3,Pros and Cons of GTA3,The graphics are really good but they could have been better like in Final Fantasy X.The violence is realistic but unecessarily grose at times.Cars break into pieces very realistically.The missions are a lot of fun but can get so hard that you'll never want to play the game again.Game requires a lot of time and patience to beat.This is still probably one of the best games ever made.
