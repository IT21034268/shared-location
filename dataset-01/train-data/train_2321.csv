5,good stuff,it does exactly what i thought it would and hasn't broke and i like how you can buy this item in black
4,"Snug, But Fully Functional","Fits very snugly into the iphone, but charges ans syncs just as well as the original cable. I do not think the snugness will cause any problems, however I'm always certain to remove and insert the cable gingerly."
3,Doesn't charge when connected to my iPhone 5 in my 2010 Honda Fit,"Unfortunately, this cable will not charge my iPhone 5 (after the first 5-10 minutes) in my Honda Fit Sport (which comes with an integrated USB connection for the stereo system) while the Apple cables do. After being connected for about 5-10 minutes, I get the ""charging is not supported with this accessory"" message :(Other than that, this cable works fine with my car's audio system; I assume it will charge in with a regular outlet but I wanted the black cable for my car (interior is dark gray / black)."
5,Just as good as Apple,"I ordered the black which is awesome. I was actually surprised as how well this thing was made. You can not tell a difference between this cable and the OEM cable.The craftsmanship is really nice, and it fits my phone just like the OEM cable.You will not be sorry you purchased this cable."
4,Excellent value over OEM cables,The cables are of very good quality and are excellent value over standard Apple OEM cables. I am very pleased with the three cables I received.
5,Works for me,I ordered this as a charging cable only to be kept in my purse and used while I'm out and about. The cable does everything I expected it to. I even bought one for my mom.
4,Finally an alternative to expensive Apple cable,Works perfectly fine. It isn't built to Apple's high specs but it gets the job done. And that is what is important to me.
4,Great deal,"The lightning cable looks and feels like an original Apple cable. The only thing that is different is the plastic surrounding the actual lightning connector. It is just a little bit bigger, but not by much. It still doesn't interfere with my case on my iPhone 5. I still need to test how long it takes to charge my phone compare to the Apple Lightning cable. Usually third party manufactured charging cables do not charge as fast as the original. Then again it is only a back up. Overall, I am happy with my purchase and the price was definitely a super bargain. I should have bought two for the price."
5,Worked Perfrect,"I live in Tucson Arizona. I ordered them on a Monday got them on a Wednesday (I ordered two cables).Great quality, both charge and sync. Forget the other reviews.. these are $30 at target. Thank you."
4,Works,"Adequately works, no problems so far. I would buy it again. It cost less than half of what I would pay for the Apple version."
4,Seems to work...,"Just got this. Including shipping is was $12 vs $19 for the Apple cable, but it does seem to work. Connects in no mater which way that you flip it. Others talk about it not fitting well, seems to be OK on my iPhone 5S. It also seems to sync Ok to my MacBook Air. So a good lower cost option."
5,"Works well, great to keep at work.","I bought this as an extra, I have several USB connectors for all the previous APPLE products but when Apple came out with the iPhone 5 and the Mini iPad it has an 8 pin connector, NOT a 30 pin. This works great, arrived quickly and I keep it at work, and the original at home."
4,They work!,I bought three of these for my daughter and I. They work for charging but don't do audio. I read about the audio limitation before I purchased them so pleased to get three more chargers for a minimal price.
5,Works great,"Works just as well as my Apple brand cable, great price for a great product. I'd buy more in the future."
2,Worked great...for 2 weeks,"Cord was a little snug but worked well, nor two weeks later the internal parts if the wire are showing near the lightning connector end. Don't waste your money and just spend the extra few dollars on the apple one.."
5,Worked on my iPhone 5,The cable looks and feels like an Apple cable and works perfectly on my iPhone 5. I notice that the lighting cable that shipped with my phone fit VERY snug in both the phone and in the USB port of my computer & charger. This cable also fit the exact same way. The extra bonus is that this cable is a bit longer than the cables that Apple sells. Nice! I highly recommend.
1,very bad product,"I bought the cable a week ago, got it in the time they said today but the big problem was, when I try to connected to my pc, wall it doesn't charge at all. hope they give my refund, im shipping this back to them"
1,Missing parts and the cable is not functioning as a charger.,I got this item and when it was purchased it was a bundle package but I only got the cable. Also the cable is not charging my iPhone 5. Looks like the cable is not recognized by iPhone 5. Wasted a few hard earned money.
1,Waste of $,Do not buy this cableNot working at allHad to buy the original cableDo not waste your money
1,Awkward fit,"I purchased these looking to save money, but that was a mistake in this case. I am a big purchaser of refurbished and non OEM products to save money especially when is comes to something like cables which have a straight forward task. The two came in and one of them didn't work. So the cost savings was thrown out the window. The one that did work did not feel like it was made for the iPhone 5. What I mean is that I had to force the connector into the phone. The stock cable fits very well obviously, and this one felt like I was going to damage my charging port. I do not recommend these, not this early in the product life of the lightning connectors. I have purchased several OEM lightning connectors from apple and they all fit great."
1,Did not work...,Opened this today and it did not work at all. I tried it on several devices with USB ports and it didn't work on any of them. I am returning it as defective.
1,Not working at all!!,"This cable should be cheaper. It is too expensive for poor quality. It works only one way! I am disappointed.Update from 2 stars to 1 star!Only after a few days. It is not working at all. It shows like it is charging, but it doesn't. After some time it will pop up warning message on my iPhone 5: ""Charging is not supported with this accessory"".Don't waste your money."
1,SCAM - DO NOT PURCHASE!,"This thing was Dead On Arrival. No signs of life - won't work as a charger and won't work via USB to connect to the computer as well. The worst thing about this? When I went to return it, I (BOLD, UNDERLINED, HIGHLIGHTED) am expected to pay the shipping for it. I am HIGHLY disappointed in Amazon for allowing this. If 0 stars were a rating option, I'd choose that instead."
3,"Seems to Work, but Larger Than Apple","Received 2 of these today. While both work ok, both the actual plug part and the larger part you hold are larger than the ones supplied by Apple. Its very snug to connect to iOS devices, so one wonders if this is really OK."
3,works ok but construction is cheaper,"first, delivery was excellent and fast. The product is ok. I bought two cords, and they both feel delicate and as if they will break easily. After two days, the casing on one of the cords connecting to the charging unit already pulled away from the main cord. However, it still charges. The charging on this unit was not automatic, as the phone stated several times that charging was not supported with that device, but after i disconnected reconnected a couple of times, it was fine.I am happy anyway as it is 1/2 the price of the apple cord."
2,Not great,"I replaced it after one week with original cable from Apple. The connection just doesn't feel right when you plug it in and I was afraid I could damage the connection in my phone. It worked for charging, but it messed up my car USB connection to my car audio system. the original Apple cable works perfect. I for one am not happy with the purchase of the knock off."
4,Good as original cord,"Syncs and charges as good as Apple original. A little tight on insertion, but no issues. I like the black color cord!"
2,It works!... sometimes.,"Spotty performance for this budget cable. I received a black one and it's done everything from charge my iPad mini, to say ""not compatible with this accessory"", only to work again after re-plugging it in. It has also shown the fully-charged icon even though the battery level was at 60%, but then it continued to charge after powering the iPad on/off. Definitely a back-up cable at best, this one will be staying at home because it's not reliable enough."
1,Does not work,"I bought this cable to use it at my work place after reading the reviews, but once i received it and tried connecting it to the PC / wall charger, it does not work at all. On the PC it says, the USB device is not recognized. I'm not sure if this is just a bad one. But i would not recommend as it is a waste of time buying and trying it out."
5,Works perfectly so far.,Charges and sends data perfectl and I love that it's longer than the original Apple cable. The only complaints so far is the plastic part of the usb plugin is a little crooked and it is very tight on the iPhone 5. Would definitely buy again.
3,Seeems to work just fine.,The cable seems to work just fine. It's a bit snug but I don't think it will be any issues. I wish the cord were longer.
3,Okay acceptable item for less buck,"A lil oversize on my iPhone , snug plug in , charge slower than the OEM , okay item .."
4,"iphone side connector might be suspect, but overall pleased","Basically happy with the purchase. Delivery and service from the supplier was very good. The product is fairly close to OEM quality, but the iPhone side of the connector is not quite as smooth when plugging it into the device. Seems to be charging my phone as expected and my PC picked up my iPhone when I plugged it in."
2,Not the best charger,It worked ok in the beginning and then it stopped charging. Not sure why it stopped working. It seemed like a good thing in the beginning.
1,bummed,I looked at all the prices and decided to play it safe and not buy the cheapest one.I guess it didn't matter - this one didn't work at all.Had to return it
1,Flawed Lightning Connector,"This is the first review I have ever submitted for a product or vendor because I am so disappointed with my transaction here on Amazon all due to the response from Boxwave.This is a flawed product that should not be sold. The dimensions of the connector are too large to fit properly into the lightning port of the iPhone 5. It will fit into the port only by using excessive force. Repeated use of this cable will damage the iPhone port and cause the connection to loosen when used with the factory supplied cable. If you inspect the end of the connector and compare it with the Apple supplied cable, it is visually apparent that its size is too large. This cable should be re-engineered with the correct dimensions.I was also unhappy with the return process and for not receiving a full refund after purchasing such a defective product. So I cannot recommend this supplier or cable to anyone that cares to keep their iphone/ipad from being damaged."
2,Low Quality,I bought 2 a bit over a month ago. One of the cables already stopped charging or syncing my iPhone 5. Waiting to see what the seller will do about it.
2,"Half the price, half the quality","I purchased three of these cables, and the first one I tried did not work at all. I was scared that they would all be like this. The other two seemed fine. Some notes about the cable:* Build quality seems moderate. Sure, it's a white cable that resembles the Apple one, but it does feel, ""cheaper.""* On the 8-pin side, the plastic is thicker and wider, leading it to have some fit problems with some cases.* The 8-pin connector isn't a unibody like the Apple one (is it waterproof per the Apple requirements of this connector?). It also is slightly larger, leading it to take slightly more force to insert and remove the connector.Does anyone know if the Boxwave cable is officially allowed to make the Lightning cable? It did not come packaged with the ""Made for iPhone"" label, suggesting that these were not licensed to be made."
1,Did Not Work,Item took a long time to be delivered and when it did arrive it did not charge my iphone 5 or allow me to connect my phone to itunes.
5,"Excellent, lower priced alternative Lightning cable","I'm sure this is just the first of many Lightning cables that we will be seeing. The cable works, no problems. I've read some other reviews that it fits tightly, but I never would have noticed it -- I think it is a negligible difference.I have aIncipio Dual PRO for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - Charcoal Gray / Citron Yellowcase for my iPhone 5 and the cable works fine with it.I RARELY sync my iPhone with the computer using the cable... I do it with wifi. I primarily plan to use this cable as a car charger, used in conjunction withAmazonBasics 2-Port USB Car Charger with 2.1 Amp Output (Black)"
5,Good cable and fair price,"Get it! Don't be dissuaded by any bad reviews, it works just like my original cable and is a great backup cable!"
1,Doesn't Work,"Do not purchase this item as its not compatible w/ the IPhone and it will not charge the phone. I received the message, something in the nature of, it not being compatible/recognized by the phone."
5,"Used for almost 2 months, works just like the official Apple lightening cable","I've used this cable for almost 2 months with my iPhone 5 and it just works. Charges and syncs without issue. I use this cable (instead of the original) about 90% of the time and it hasn't caused any issues at all. My original cable that came with the iPhone continues to work after using the BoxWave lightening cable.Regarding what people say about the snugness, it is definitely more snug than the original but not alarmingly by any means. Its possible some people got bad cables. I have 3 of these and none of them are overly snug.The nice thing about this BoxWave lightening cable over the generic ones on Amazon is that the plastic around the lightning connector is roughly the same size as the original. It is a little bit thicker but nowhere as thick as a generic I bought off Amazon."
4,Good price for replacement cable,Pros:Works just like the Apple cableInexpensiveCons:The fit is a little snug (takes a little work to get it on and off)Overall it's a good cable for the price especially since Monoprice has not had any on their website yet.
4,"Works fine! Tight fit, though.","It works just fine, charging iPhone 5. The small end (that goes to the phone) is a bit of a snug fit, but does work. Be careful stuffing it in the phone, or one could possibly damage the jack on the phone, or the plug itself."
2,Product Works but USB Dongle broke off,The product works and charges eh iphone 5 well but the dongle broke off from normal use as my car charging cable.
1,Unreliable,"The lightning connector is too loose and does not maintain a connection (on the lightning end of cable). Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes my iPad 4th Gen says the accessory is not compatible and won't charge.This is a faulty/unreliable design. You can tell because the Apple lightning cable is completely snug when inserted, and there is no wiggle room. However, with this Boxwave cable, the lightning connector doesn't not fit completely snug, and there is a little wiggle room.If you examine the connectors closely you can see very subtle differences between the Apple and the Boxwave as far as the contact strips are concerned, as well as the dimensions. Apple designed this with extremely tight tolerances (compared to typical consumer electronics connectors), obviously to make it difficult to knock off."
1,Junk,"Came apart on the first use. I knew I was taking a risk buying this but I went for it because I have had good luck before with similar items, I guess my luck ran out."
1,Cable does not work. Avoid at all costs.,The cable simply does not work. It's a fake. Buyers beware. Avoid at all costs. Do not purchase. Don't waste your money.
1,"Worked at first, but quit right after the return period","Please don't waste your money on this cable. Buy one from Apple. Had I written this review right after I received the cable, I would have said it's great. Now that it's just past the 30-day return window, it doesn't work. When I plug my iPad Mini into it, it looks like it's charging, but when I check it a few hours later, it hasn't charged at all. The Apple cable works great, so it's not my iPad. I always used this cable at the same desk. I didn't carry it around. It had an easy life, so it had every chance possible to work well, but failed. I tried to give it zero stars, but it wouldn't let me."
3,???,"They work but it takes to long. Maybe I just got a bad set. If I had the chance to do this over again, i would not buy them."
1,Don't buy - quite working,Quite working after a month. Don't waste your money on this cable. I'm back to using the expensive Apple cables.
1,both broke within the first few uses,"These came in a set of 2. The first one, I plugged into a USB power adapter for the car, and after having to plug it in and out a few times after getting ""charging not supported with this accessory"", it would finally charge my iphone 5. That wasn't the main problem. What bothers me most, is that the cord broke already. The USB broke loose from the fitting. It seemed a bit loose when I got it, but now it is off. I honestly do not remember it happening, or having anything apply pressure to it, just normal use in a car console. I have had other cables that have lasted for years in the same car. The second one, I have the same problem, but this one is only bending in half at the USB connection rather than totally broken off. It's probably only a matter of time before that breaks too. Disappointed with this product."
1,Neither one will provide a charge to my mini.,"That almost fit well, but there is a bit too play between the plug and the mini. I tried to charge for two hours,Without any luck. When i hooked it up to the cord which came from Apple,the mini was completelycharged in under 2 hours. They are being returned and I will be at the Apple store in the morning."
2,Works sometimes,Sometimes it works but I have to wiggle it. It acts as if it has a short in it but someone else said the same thing so I guess it's just how it's made. I'd rather pay the $10 extra to get an Apple cord & feel confident that my phone will be able to charge.
2,Hit and Miss,"These cables are a mixed bag. Altogether I've purchased 5 in three different orders (2 white, then 1 black, then 2 white.) One order of the 2 white cables plus the 1 black cable are defective. They work for a while (sometimes and hour or more) then I get a message on the IPhone that the unit is incompatible with the phone. And, the cables seem to DRAW power from the IPhone instead of charging it. If I plug the cable into a USB power adapter WITHOUT plugging the power adapter into a power source, the power adapter's light indicates power is flowing thru it. This seems strange to me. My original apple cable does not do this, and, the 2 other BoxWave cables I received don't do this either nor do they create any errors on my IPhone. So, 2 out of 5 I don't consider good odds. Until Apple's competitors get it right, I'm sticking with original Apple cables."
1,Bad Contacts,Will not work with iPhone 5 but does work with Retinal Display iPad. I can't explain why but suggest you try another cord.
1,Won't securely charge..,I ordered this cable for my ipad mini as a spare. It will charge the mini as long as you don't move it or bump it. The connector pin does not securely attach to the mini. It jiggles when connected which of course stops the charging. I trusted box wave as quality seller so I don't know if this cable is a defect or just a poorly made product.
4,Works fine if you can get it to fit,"I bought two of these - one for me and one for my wife - for our iPhone 5's. We needed something we could take in our work bags to plug into our USB outlet in the cars and office. For me it works as advertised. Charges fast and is nearly identical to the OEM part. The thing is I do not have a restrictive case on my iPhone. My wife does. For her, since the end of the lightning plug is fatter than the original Apple plug, it does not plug in without taking off her case. Yes, a hassle but she says not a biggy. I would give it 5-stars, but she had that small problem so I knocked off a star."
5,Works as expected,"I have tried this cable with my iPhone and an Apple supplied wall brick, an Apple iPad brick and a third party USB car charger. They all function correctly. Cable also works syncing with my Windows 8 computer using iTunes 11. Took 9 days longer to arrive than seller specified."
1,Fake USB lightning cable. Does not always work with IPHONE 5 so beware!,Does not always work with IPHONE 5 so beware! Plugged it in a few times to make sure the cable works. It finally worked after the 5th or 6th time. I guess you get what you pay for!
2,"Only Works One Way. Unlike Apple Cable, This Can be Upside Down","For some reason, my cable only works one way. I have to confirm that it is charging. If it isn't, I have to flip it over, and it starts working. My Apple cable does not require this. I haven't tried it with a power cube, but the issue above occurrs with the USB port."
1,Does not work!,Bought two - did not work with any combination of iPhone and plugs that we had (2 of each). Not worth saving $10 to have to return it anyways.
4,Works Great....Most of the Time,"Quick delivery of product. Costs less than official Apple product. I've used it for 2 weeks and there's been a few times I found it wasn't charging but rather was draining. When I plugged the cable in, i waited for the audible signal that it was charging and even checked to see that the lightning bolt symbol was in the battery icon. However, when I returned later (i charged it before going to sleep), the battery was actually lower than when i plugged it in! I don't know if there's a right-side up way to plug it in or not like some other lightning cable reviews have stated but this has happened a few times. Like I said, most of the time, it has worked fine. So now, i just make sure i check to see that it is charging and the battery meter increases before leaving it alone."
1,These cables suck,"I got it late and it didn't work for my iphone 5. This product sucks, i don't suggest any one buy it."
1,Did not sync my iphone 5,I bought two of these cables and neither would allow my iPhone 5 to sync. A waste of time and effort!
2,Sometime works some time doesn't!,"Very picky when and where it want to works. I plug it in my car USB charger and it won't charge, showed ""unauthorized charger"". I then try to plug it in the house charger and it doesn't work at first but when I tried to flip it around then it works. I will try to see if it will consistently charge it with the house charger before sending it back."
2,Stamped connector,"The lightning connector is stamped, making the quality of the cable lower than that of the Apple cable. Given that I need to rely on my cable to charge my iPhone, I keep this one in the car where it will be used the least."
2,Not bad,"It works as advertised. I've only charged so I can't confirm if it also syncs. I give the product a 3 but knocked the rating down to a 2 because of Boxwave's service. I ordered 2 sets of the bundle that was supposed to come with with a car adapter, however they only sent me both cables without the adapter. These were separate orders and Boxwave messed up on both my orders. I've already communicated with them and they said they are looking into it. It has almost been 2 weeks and nothings happened. As others have mentioned, the casing on the lightening cable end is a bit larger than the OEM cable so those with a case that has a small opening may have issues."
4,Charges and syncs both ways,Slightly more snug when plugging it into the phone but charges and syncs in any orientation. So far so good.
3,mixed review,"ordered 2 cables and one worked great while the other ""fit"" very snug into the bottom of my device and periodically worked. boxwave is switching out for me though."
5,Works just as good as Apple's,I have had NO problems with this cable. Fits in phone perfect. I could not tell the difference from the OEM
2,"Works half the time, should have bought OEM","In summary, works for charging and sync, with few caveats:1- Items shipped later than promised2- I ordered 2, one of was DOA3- RMA for DOA item took 3 weeks to process, with no response from seller in the interim4- Replacement item cable only works for one sideLesson learned here is I should have gotten the OEM cable since with the hassle of the items not working, RMA and sub part quality (cable is brittle vs OEM which is softer and smaller), I spent nearly the same amount of money and 10 times the effort."
4,Works,"The connectors on each end are a kind of tight fitting but functionally it works for charging and for sync,"
4,AN ENCHANTING STORY,"Joe Delacamp couldn't believe his eyes.Louisa, the love of his life had made it to Erie, as they had talked about so many years ago.Was it fate that had finally brought him here? Louisa seemed to have made a life for her self in the place they had dreamed about coming to.But the bigger shock was the green-eyed little boy that called Louisa mama. When had she had a child. Just after leaving him?He didn't know about his interfering mother's plan to save him and his career. Yet Louisa had always rested in the back of his mind.Maybe he had a chance with her and their son if he took it slow. He had to gain Aaron's trust and Louisa's heart as he had never stopped loving her.This was a beautiful love and reunion story with dreams come true.Definitely Recommended --"
5,a wonderful compelling story.,"peter farrely has done it all, a great book (outside providence) three absolutely hilarious films, and a great thinker. i would reccomend this to any one. I have to agree this is as good as the comedy writer."
3,Interesting draft,"Peter Farrelly has already commented that this book was not his best work and that he had a obsession with death in the novel. This is very true, as many loose ends are tied up with gruesome deaths and odd plot switches. However what I have read of the screenplay version,directed by Michael Corrente of Federal Hill and American Buffalo fame,looked more promising. At least more logical and less immature (yes, it is safe to say that Peter Farrelly has matured)."
3,Too Much Schmaltz,"The trick with collections of some of the lesser swing bands is to filter out the commercially dictated pop music they were forced to record and concentrate on the essential and jazz-based sides. This has not been done here. So while this is some great jazz flavored pop music, I think one woiuld do better to hunt down a used copy ofStomp It Off, far better material and vastly superior remastered sound. Even some documentation. Currently many bargain-priced copies on Amazon."
3,Thought...,I'm kind of new to all this wicca 'stuff'. It just keeped turning up so i took it as a sign. From what i have read (i've done hours a day researching both on and off the internet)ture wicca it mostly of you own power and items are used to channel that power. So you could do most things without the items. I think this would be good for people who want to learn to channel that power if their a beginner.
1,You'll do better at an arts&crafts store.,"Tacky spell bag: $2.00 handmadeGold cord: $3.00 per spoolQuartz crystal: $1.00Pentacle pendant: $5.00Little silver bauble: ""Free"" (check your granny's jewelry box)Two cheap coins: ""Free"" (in your pocket)Sea Salt: ""Free"" (in your cabinet)Taking teens for total idiots: Priceless"
1,Utterly tasteless,"Silver Ravenwolf, for some reason, has decided to treat the seventh largest religion in the US as though it were a party game, playing off of the popular 'craft' image portrayed by the media.Teaching kids about the religion is one thing - but this is just tacky and utterly tasteless. Compare the concept to a ""Teen Communion Kit"" or some other trivialization of a religion.If Mrs. Ravenwolf wants to market a product like this as a 'Teen Magic Kit', more power to her, but she has become a well-known name (some would say 'infamous') to a serious religion. To take her party game and wrap it in the trappings of the religion is offensive and inappropriate."
2,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS ITEM,I purchased this kit last year thinking that it would have interesting things in it. I was wrong. The only thing that is interesting is the book that comes with it. It's basically a cheap kit that's fun for kids to play with but it's nothing like real wicca. When I was about to buy it my dad told me to read the reviews. All the reviews said that it was bad but I wanted it so much that I ignored them. I should have paid attention to them though because it was a waste of 20 dollars. I strongly reccomend that you talk with friends or family that may have it before you buy it.
1,not that great...,"I think that this kit would be great for someone that's serious about being a witch...but for all the little teens that run around wanting to cast hexes and curses, it's not that good. some teen will buy this kit, wear the pentacle and tell everyone they're a witch and that they're gonna hex them. they'll use this totally positive thing to scare other people and throw them further into the belief that witches are evil. silver sold out on this one."
4,Great for my 8yr old! WITH GUIDANCE!,"(Not so great for the older crowd) I have just recently started sharing my religion with my children. This kit was something my 8 year old son found easy to work with. He really likes it. AND...I think it is better suited for his age group anyway, with the ""cheap"" items it includes. I think an older ""teen"" would be insulted by the kits' contents--especially a studied member of the religion. It is definitely for beginners (with a parent's guidance, mind you!). Good start for smaller children. It helps my son feel like he is more a part of our monthly and daily rituals."
3,Mixed feelings,"I admit it, when I first heard that this kit was coming out, Iwas really bothered. Not for the reasons most people seem to be bothered by it, but I was concerned about the quality of the items in it, that they would be poor quality. I also had to question the whole 'Insta-Witch' idea of the kit. Last night I actually saw the pentacle from the kit. Ah, no, I didn't like it. But I also had a chance to look at the book that comes with the kit. That wasn't too bad. I think there would be an interesting market were the book to be sold on its own. Perhaps Silver's Spells for Teens. And about the comment of the spell involving Ma'at, yes I looked at that too. Considering it is meant to be used with the idea that justice truly is blind and Silver even cautions against using it if your hands are not clean, I found nothing at all 'bad' about it. Like I said, I hope that the book gets offered on its own. For the rest of the stuff...who knows..."
4,Aprentice Witch Kit,"If you are starting out or are just learning, this kit is good for you. Legalities will not permit a kit marketed to teenagers to be to intense, so don't expect an insta-witch kit. Try it, if this feels right, THEN move up into the harder stuff. Remember: Ever mind the rule of three, what ye sends out comes back to thee, Carry this in mind and heart, and Merry ye meet, and Merry ye Part."
4,Overall its good,"So the supplies are cheap, so the altar is made of paper..... who cares? Wicca is for the mind and spirit... it doesnt matter if ure using a 100 dollar crystal or a 1 dollar one. What matters is if you believe in it. This kit does not, contrary to popular belief, sell out commercially. Its just for kids, not adults. Children, (which it should be directed to, not teens)will get what they need out of this. I felt that Silver, with her book Teen Witch, gets the message across, and explains the religion well. She DOES put suggested reading with it, so you can go on further in witchcraft. For a beginner who is under 15, this is very recommended."
1,dissapointing,"although I am very interested and dedicated to Wicca and other pagan paths, I found this kit to be very childish, an not worth a single dollar. I am a teenager, but this kit had very cheap materials, a silly yes/no coin, as if I would put all my decisions on a coin, and a book filled with spells that instead of showing the spirituality of Wicca, say that if you set up this cardboard altar and throw a crystal around, all your problems will be solved. I have found most of Ravenwolfs books and kits to be lacking in substance, but this is certainly the worst"
1,"$ilver RavenPoof's degrading ""Witch-kit""","$ilver's ""Teen Witch Kit"" absolutely appalled me. The ""altar"" is plastic, the tools are cheap and the underlying theme that spirituality can be sold in a box is extremely unnerving. Teen witches please do yourself a favor and stay away from this one. Do not touch it with a ten foot pole. This is not what The Craft is about, not by a long shot. I was a ""teen witch"" not too long ago myself, so don't think this is a review coming from some angry 40 year old who has forgotten how to relate or the problems a young witch faces. Build yourself a solid foundation in the spirituality of Witchcraft and stay away from anything plasticy and instant. Use your intuition. My book recommendations are: Power of the Witch by Laurie Cabot and Good Magic by Marina Medici"
1,Pure Garbage To Make Money For Llewellyn,"Silver Ravenwolf and Llewellyn team up to rake in the cashfrom gullible teenagers who wan't to be a witch after seeingthe movie ""The Craft,"" or from watching ""Sabrina the Teenage Witch."" Ravenwolf should have her witch license revoked forproducing such garbage! Shame on her and shame on Llewelynfor even putting this on the market. It is indeed an insultto everything witchcraft is about and stands for. And shameon all of you who purchased this. Well, if you're that stupidyou deserve to be swindled."
1,Bad quality and in bad taste,"I bought this when I was tweleve: the items within the kit are cheap. The only thing that survived after a few weeks was the pentacle pendant.And now I read the discription and think a teen witch KIT?!Seriously, bad taste. If you REALLY want to be a witch or wiccan or pagan or whatever? Look around the internet, go to supply stores, ask around. Don't think a kit is going to lay it out for you and tomorrow morning you'll be Sabrina. This isn't a game it's a religion."
1,Instant Religion?!,"Making Wicca accessible is great. Dispelling the ridiculous myths surrounding it is great. But giving people the false idea that one can simply buy some props and be a Witch is misleading, to say the very least. You cannot become ""instantly Jewish"" or an ""instant Catholic"", nor can you become an ""instant Wiccan"".The Old Religion is a faith that one must embrace within their own heart. Through study and practicing, one learns to create their own traditions, rites and spellcraft.Their is nothing wrong with Silver Raven Wolf making a living. We all must do that.However, this type of ""product"" cheapens the reality and true beauty of Wicca. Spirituality is not a toy or a game to be sold, rather it is something that should be respected and cherished.Everything you need to make Magick is easily found within your own heart, your own mind and in the vastness of Mother Earth."
4,A double-eged sword,"The kit was good yet not. It would be good for teenage kids who were not raised in a family that followed the wiccan(what ever you prefere to call it) path. It is very good for those teens who chose to hide their choice of religion. It gives them what they need to learn with out being flashy and saying ""hello!!"".Those who raised in such a family may find it a little less like-able. The reason being they probaly already have the things they need for their chosen path."
1,I'm surprised her craft name isn't Gold Ravenwolf,"This kit is hilarious. Flimsy, cheap, fake, fluffy... shall I go on?I wish I could say that i'm surprised at this, but with her other (over-priced, incorrect) products, I'm not.I wonder why she doesn't change her name to ""gold,"" or even something like ""coin"""
3,no kit,when i got this i only got the book no kit i was ripped off if i could get this kit i would love it
3,Teen Witch Kit,"Although the kit appeared to look new when I first opened it, I found several pieces missing which cost me more money in the end as it was a gift for my daughter. This makes me wish to only make sure the future items I purchase are brand new as to avoid any futher problems."
1,And for $19.99! You too can be a WITCH!,"That was my initial impression on hearing this book was coming out. And... it hasn't changed. Everyone else has put it nicely the problems with this book and kit.You'd better going out and finding your own magical tools and materials to work with. The quartz crystal was sad. The pentagram... eh.. and so on and the spells... mmm... right.I personally only liked the Thunder Water Spell for making Holy Water. And it's been the only one to give me any worth while results.If you really want this kit, find it used, find it cheap."
2,Ummm! Why?,Good for beginners but made really cheap. The only thing worth it is the book and maybe the quartz but thats cutting it close.
2,Not quite...,"I wasn't entirely impressed with Silver's latest item: Teen Witch Kit. I bought it hoping it would have something to add to my knowledge of the Craft, as it was directed to TEENS which I am. But... being serious about my studies, I already have an extensive collection of books and magical paraphenalia. What I found in Silver's kit was extremely disappointing, and I wouldn't recommend it to anybody who already has Silver's Teen Witch book and understands it fine. The Teen Witch Kit should have been directed to a much younger level, and I feel slightly insulted that Silver thought the book and objects she included were suited for the age group it was advertised for."
3,Too costly,"Vintage or not, this black gold is over my chocolate budget.Sure, it's fantastic. I was treated to a taste from one of these bars not long ago by a friend who'd received it as a get-well gift. Oh my! It was heaven.But this chocolate is only 64% cocoa, compared with 75% cocoa for other Madagascar chocolate brands---and the shipping runs more than the cost of the 2.64 ounce bar. At that price, you could hang the stuff on your neck at a black tie party.Thanks, but I'm not in this market, no matter how good it tastes."
3,ZZZZZZ. . . .,"I was really excited when I opened up this Love Stories book and started reading. The plot seemed interesting and the characters were intriguing. Then by the middle of the book I wondered where the story had went. The supposed-to-be amazing ending turned out dull and tiresome. I Forced myself to finish this book. I will, however, give the author credit for their creativity with the plot and characters. It just didn't full fill my standardes being a love stories obsesive and having a wide range of books to compete with. If you're looking for a truly heartwarming love story try I Do by Elizabeth Chandler. Now that was a good book!"
4,His other Girlfriend,This book was ok. This girl named Erica always pushes her best friend Paul to get a girlfriend so when he finally does get a gf Erica gets all jelous.The ending was pretty good and sweet for a girl who doesnt like to make out in public
2,It's So Boring!,"This book is total sap. This girl falls in love with this guy, realizes that she really loves her best friend (a guy) and dumps the other guy which happened to be using her. Where have I heard taht story line before? And there's about tons of sap stuff, especially at the end. The ending was sweet but for a girl who hates PDA, she sure is a romantic. Try I Do (Elizabeth Chandler) or Never Tell Ben"
5,Sleek looking and fast,Shopping for Skim boards to fit a bunch of different aged kids can be tough.I was looking for something fast but durable and easy for all the kids to use.We have bought several of the the cheap boards from the boardwalk shops and wanted an upgrade. This one fits the bill it is made by Body Glove and is durable and still really fast.The kids play with it for hours and I get to relax on the beach.
3,Too Much Talk,"I purchased this item thinking that it was an African folktale that I used to read when I was a child. It was not, however, I did give it to one of my nieces."
5,Too Much Talk: A west African Folktale,"An excellent story to read, tell, dramatize, etc. with second through fourth graders. My students love it and want it read to them again and again!"
1,Copy protection stinks!!,"How can I write a review on the cd when I can't even play it on my computer? I'm sure the cd has some good songs on it, but it won't play and it won't transfer to my Dell Dj. Big waste of money. A few people are ruining it for the good honest people that are paying money for the cds. Booo!!!"
4,Cagle continues.,"There's nothing groundbreaking on this album, and it's not an improvement on Chris's first two. The second one remains his best. But this one has plenty of what he does well--sing with a hot-fudge baritone about things female fans in particular will likely care about. There are a number of downbeat love-is-over songs that sound heartfelt (Chris got a divorce since his second album). The best song on the album for me is ""You Still Do That to Me,"" the best slow-dancing country number by a man since Gene Watson's ""At Last"" (from the 1991 album of that name, sadly now deleted). I docked this a star because I was turned off by the first cut, an in-your-face political/religious song. Why do singers think they have to take a position on current issues?"
1,Anywhere But Here,"If you love music and like to be able to copy songs to your IPOD or make .mp3 mixes for your car's .mp3 player, then DON'T BUY THIS CD. You can't do either. In fact, you shouldn't buy ANY CD with copy protection on it that won't allow file conversion and compilation mixing. I like the CD, but I took it, Patty Loveless's new one and Ryan Shupe and the Rubber Band's CDs and sent them back to the manufacturer - they are not worth keeping, and therefore, not worth buying. I was going to simply toss them out, but by sending them back and not buying anymore they'll have no doubt about how stupid this ""protection"" plan is."
1,Don't even bother,"This CD is ok regarding country music but the ""Copy protection"" issue drove me crazy. That without mentioning neither my CD player or my computer at home (Linux system) play this CD. In this case, Chris Cagle and all singers out there should pay more attention to what ""the music industry"" tried to do. I can tell you I will NOT buy any more CDs if this means having that ""protection"" installed.... by the way, who is getting protected with this? Certainly not me!"
5,Best Country Artist by Far,I am a devoted Chris Cagle fan and I think by far this is his best cd yet. But there will only be bigger and better things happening for him in the future. My favorite song on the new cd is You Might Want to Think about That... It reminds us all that we are free to do as we want and we don't need people telling us what to do. And it also reminds us that people fought and died so that we could have this freedom. Chris is also a wonderful live performer and if you ever have a chance to see him don't miss out. You're sure to become a Caglehead too after listening to this new cd.
1,Useless,"Don't bother with this one. If there's a particular track you like, buy it for 99 cents online somewhere because the rest of the CD certainly isn't worth the other fourteen bucks. Plus with the incredibly aggravating copy protection it's just about useless...Amazon would be well advised to list which CDs have this protection, becuase I'm sure I'll never knowingly buy another CD that has it, and it makes for a very dissatisfying purchasing experience."
3,"DO NOT BUY !!! CD Made my computer re-boot, caused problems","Sorry Chris, your music is great but I can't buy another one of your CD's as your label insists on not allowing me to copy the songs on to my Dell DJ. The software that automatcally load on your PC when you play the CD made my computer re-boot for no reason at all when I put other CD's in to listen to them, wreaked havoc on my musicmatch software and also loads hidden almost impossible to remove software on your computer that also enables viruses from thers to hide on your computer UNDETECTED by virus software. NOTE to music industry, you are forcing customers who normally buy CD's to stop buying to protect our computers from your unwanted software! I buy from 4-6 CD's a month. NO MORE I'm done! NICE JOB!Music on the CD is not as good as Chris Cagles last two CD's, but still good."
4,I second Minnesota's comments,"Is it only middle-aged Midwestern guys who remember this talented woman? Anyway, all I can add to Minnesota's review is that I bought this CD for the bump-and-grind classic, ""The Nitty Gritty,"" which exudes sexuality and raunch while still managing to sound cool 35 years after it was played on Top 40 radio. (Believe it!) Of course, she is best known for ""The Name Game,"" but this selection of songs shows Ms. Ellis to be very, very good at delivering just about any style. The sound of these 10 tracks is first-rate. If the CD is reissued, you might consider getting it. I'm glad I did, before it was withdrawn from Amazon's shelves."
1,Dumb Game,This game ia so stupid. i don't get how these dumb games get on the shelf or in this case was on the shelf.
3,Big Dissapointment,"I bought this DVD, Watched a little bit, and the Returned it because even thought the technical information page says that it plays in english and japanese it only plays in japanese and english subtitles. I was very dissapointed."
2,Sub VS. Dub,I completely agree that they really messed this one up. I do enjoy the subs much better then most of the dubs. But my thoughts are that if we by the dubbed then they will make more subs. Reasoning...If people don't like the dubbed version what makes the big corps think that they can sell subbed. Usually I try to buy both when I'm able to but I do prefer the sub. My reason for the dubs are so that americans will see the animation and if they like the dubbed plot I sure they like the subbed one even better.
1,Sakura Everlasting Memoriers,"the dvd arrived on time and in good condition BUT, the movie is in Japaneese there is no way for my daughter to understand it. That should have been made CLEARER in the discription of the item. Now i feel that i have wasted my money."
5,Cardcaptor Sakura: an otake's dream!,"This DVD is just awesome! It can be watched with or without subtitles. It has the beginning and end songs at the end of each episode, and even has a bonus where Kero gives his commmentary about Sakura's clothes. It's neat to hear all of the character's voices (Kero has the cutest voice ever!) I recommend this DVD to anyone! For all you CCS fans, this DVD has it all!"
2,Dissapointed,"Looks great in the picture, but when it arrived, it was ugly. The outside of the piece was very unappealilng. I gave mine away."
1,HOW DO YOU USE THIS ON A KINDLE????,"I AGREE WITH THE OTHER REVIEWER, IF SOMEONE CAN TELL ME HOW TO USE THE STRONG'S ON MY KINDLE, PLEASE DO."
5,"A ""must have"" for every Christian.","Every person who studies the Bible needs a Concordance, I personally like Strong's and recommend and encourage every Christian to purchase one. My purchase was to replace our original Strong's Exhaustive Concordance that has been through 20 years worth of use. A must have for studying and finding scripture."
5,Strongs Exhaustive Concordance,This book has been the answer to my prayers for better understanding. I don't know why I waited so long to order this great reference book.
5,Strong's Exhaustive Concordance,Although this is a very old version it is certainly a great study tool. It came in good condition and in a very timely manner. I'm very pleased with this purchase.
2,"Bought as new item, recieved a used item.","The Strongs Exhaustive Concordance is a great study tool for those who are realy interested in bible study. I give the book an A++, I was just disappointed to receive a used item when I ordered a new item."
2,Strong's Exhaustive Concordance of the Bible,"This item was sent instead of the ISBN number that I punched in. It is much larger than what I ordered. I wanted the smaller version. I never gave it a thought that your system would bring other books up other than the number requested. I do appreciate the fact shipping was provided to send the item back, but am very hesitant to reorder."
5,Outstanding,The service I received was outstanding. The books arrived in outstanding condition. These books are very important when reading and studying the bible. Understand Hebrew and Greek are very instrumental when studying.
5,You cannot beat the original,"Although it has been twenty years since I have used my KVJ Bible, Strongs is still the best. It has been my number one Bible study tool for almost thirty years of ministry. I do not know what I would do without it. Over the years, I have tried to use contemporary concordances but have found them wanting. Nothing is as exhaustive of a resource as Strongs.For students who lack training in the original languages, the numbering system and Greek and Hebrew lexicons in the back or invaluable aids to Bible study. It gives the student non-technical access to the original languages. And for the most part, it does a pretty good job.Any weaknesses? Only a few. Occasionally I find a word that Strong overlooked, but they are few and far between. Considering that this massive research was done without the aid of a computer, this is really an amazing feat. I have tried them all and you cannot beat the original."
5,Should be on EVERY Witches bookshelf!,"An absolutely wonderful little book on witchcraft regarding some of its native roots written by a scholar with a Phd. in Germanic studies, this little book Edred has written is a treasure trove of information. My only ""complaint"" is that I wish it were bigger.It is witchcraft from a Germanic Heathen perspective and a refreshing view on such matters.If you feel called to the Elder Faiths of old, do NOT pass this up!"
5,Very Well Done!,"Corporate America would be 100 times a more pleasant arena if executives would live by this book.D.A. Benton outlines all the key characteristics that are necessary for effective communication in today's business environment.With increased numbers of firms moving towards a learning organization, personal accountability is in great demand. It would be a wise move during change efforts to utilize this material as a tool for executive development."
1,"The title is great, the content is lacking.",I could not make it through the book as it is so fragmented and repetitive in what it is trying to say. It appears that she is just trying to impress the reader with all the CEOs she has met as she is constantly referring and quoting them. There are better books out there.
2,Stretching Good Material,"Deborah Benton is a serious student of what makes successful business people successful, and her book 'How to Think Like a CEO"" reflects the seriousness and depth of her work there.This book, on the other hand, is a very long hike for a very small picnic. She has essentially re-worked very familiar ground for her into a book that simply doesn't have enough to say to fill its length.There are times, for example, when while reading, one realizes that the last paragraph has been nothing but semi-connected quotes from people in the large archive of Ms. Benton's interview files. It doesn't really go together and it doesn't really make any new points.I would strongly recommend 'How to Think Like a CEO' but I would definitely not recommend this book."
2,Too little valuable materials for a book,"This book is not worth buying, unfortunately.The 200+ pages can be easily and adequately illustrated in just one or two pages. The author was trying to beef up the book by sprinkling it with both relevant and irrelevant quotes. She keeps repeating herself and go on-and on even for a very simple point. And, those points were already covered in the previous books.Benton wrote a couple good books in the past. This is not one of them.My recommendation to the author is: please do more research and write a book with more ""meat"". Readers are sharp - they can tell whether the author has done his/her due-diligence in preparation."
4,Not their best,"The first release of one of underground's finest. Overall, this album doesn't have quite as much of the relentless chaos heard in their later EP and full-length. Though still retaining a degree of that trademark, jazz-on-... DEP sound, it's less complex, more refined, and holds more of a clear hardcore punk influence.Needless to say, though, it is still an excellent album. Ludicrous speeds, diminished chords, insane vocals, etc. The high point of this album is probably the bunus live tracks. ""Sugar Coated Sour"" sounds even more raw and agressive then the studio cut, and the priceless, extended version of ""Abe the Cop"" contains an ambient breakdown (the same from ""Weekend Sex-Change"") boasting Chris Pennie's mad drum skills.Easily worth the price. What else matters?"

What else matters?"
1,Violent book written by a troubled woman,"This is an extremely violent book written by a woman who clearly has issues with spanking from her own childhood. Hitting isn't from God, and if anyone looks deep into their heart, they will understand that intrinsically and without question. Just look at the cover on this book with an angry mother towering over her child. Who wants to create a home environment that looks like that? What an unloving dictatorship of a home, one ruled by the weaponry of angry hands and objects. Parents who raise children with this much violence are always the ones left wondering why their children don't call them later in life. This is why, people.If your spouse hits you all the time, you will either hate them secretly or divorce them. If you hit your kids all the time, they will either hate you secretly or, when they're old enough, divorce you from their lives. Hitting doesn't have different effects on children and adults. Hitting has the same effect on everyone."
1,Horrible!,"If it were possible to give a 0-star review, I would have. Plowman's suggestions on discipline border on child abuse. Her interpretation of the Bible is theologically flawed, and many scientific studies have proven that the methods she suggests do not work. I believe that parents who want the best for their children will not use her methods. I highly recommend Dr Sears and Crystal Lutton for better suggestions."
1,Too bad to be true,"If you approve of facist, and all of the other polytical ideology based on total submission from the government, then this book is for you. If you feel that people aren't allowed to have freedom then this book is for you too. Finally if you are doing some kind of research about how is it possible to exist so many cruelty in the world, then this book is also for you, since it teaches you how to create a feelingless cruel human. Otherwise don't waste your money and time."
1,Not interested,"Heard lots of great reviews for this book, through the TV & friends but had no idea it was so religious! Too out there to keep me interested in reading at all. I'm sure there are some good points & a lot of what i did read i was doing but without all the religious babble. I will not push religious views onto my child, if they chose to follow that path it will be of their own accord."
5,"Young hearts, Good Decisions","This book is very insightful and encouraging for all mothers, especially new moms. If your child/children are young, under five, it is the perfect start. Plowman leads you through her own experiences which aid in ideas of reaching your own child's heart. If you can help your child decide what choices demonstate love he/she will be in the right direction in making good choices. And if you start when they're young, hopefully they will choice to do the right things more and more often."
2,A Ted Tripp Knock-off,"If you are looking for a good book on biblical parenting, skip this one and go straight to Shepherding a Child's Heart, by Ted Tripp. All the best stuff in this book is from his book.This book promises concrete, practical guidance, but really it just consists of her recounting her own personal experiences - which do not translate to every family.Keep in mind that I dislike the style adopted by women writing for women, and I especially dislike the style adopted by Christian ""how-to"" writers. (I.e. Max Lucado: sentimental, anecdote-heavy, glad-to-know-ya, Scripture taken out of context, cheap, sloppy). If you do not share my distaste or opinion, you might find this book helpful."
3,"Helpful, but also a touch simplistic","This is a pretty good parenting book, but like many parenting books it lacks nuance. Read in conjunction with other books, it could be helpful, especially to moms--as long as it's read with discernment."
5,A must have for moms,"This is a great book that gives practical examples to follow. It is refreshing to read Godly advice on discipline that centers around the heart of the problem. This is not a quick fix, it is a positive change in your child's behavior. Our job as parents is to point them toward God. This book is a great tool to help us do that."
1,Just Horrible!!,This book goes against the teachings of Jesus. Jesus would NEVER hit a child! Jesus does NOT promote violence! THIS BOOK promotes violence and teaches kids to hit.
1,Ugh!! Not another bad parenting book!,"All I can say is ""Don't waste your money on this book!"" It is filled with examples of how to ""whip"" your child and why you should. Clearly Mrs. Plowman thinks ""whipping"" is the answer to all your parenting problems, and she even believes some adults should get a ""good old-fashioned whippin"". The tone of this book is very adversarial. It doesn't even sound like she likes children, but sees them as an intrusion in her life. Very sad! Do yourself and your precious children a favor and skip this book. Read something that encourages your to love your children and be a better mother, not a prison warden!"
1,Disappointing book,"I was disappointed to find that this book was nothing more than yet another ""Christian"" book filled with instructions on how to spank your children, including physical punishment of babies and toddlers. This is truly the very lowest form of parenting, and it's a shame that there aren't more Jesus-centric books being written in this genre about thoughtful, grace-filled, patient teaching and actual parenting.We will certainly not be implementing this book in our own family.Show me a book that involves acquiring actual parenting skills (rather than how to train your child like a bear), and I will be overjoyed to purchase it!"
1,This Is NOT God's Word But The Devil's,"If this woman knew anything about God, this book would never have been written. It is not the word of God and anyone who will ask HIM what the truth is, HE will tell you. How sad that children have to suffer because of people listening to the devil and the greed and abuse that he has put into this woman's heart. Know your Bible instead of abusing your children!Jeanne M Irons"
4,Very Good Book!,This is a very good/humorous book. The only thing negative was that it took so long to receive! I have ordered many items from Amazon and have always received my purchases in a timely manner from the various shippers but this particular shipper took 2-3 weeks longer and I needed it for a Bible Study Class.
1,never hit your children!,"How can this author consider spanking to be ""heart-oriented discipline""?!I am a child development specialist with an advanced degree in child development and I have been working with children for 12 years. Decades of research shows that spanking children is detrimental to their mental, emotional, and physical health. It is also damaging to the parent-child relationship. Children need and deserve parents who respect them and guide them, not parents who hurt them. Children are not born evil nor do they need to be ""trained"" to be ""good"". Jesus himself proclaimed that children should be treated with kindness. How can hitting an innocent child be kind?!"
5,Paige's parenting,Excellent biblical instruction for loving heart-oriented parenting. Highly recommended along with the Tripps books.
1,SAY WHAT?????,"If you are looking for a book that really teaches how to minister to or instruct the heart of a child, as a parent, or teacher or guardian.... the book I would strongly recommend in place of this one is ""Connection Parenting: Parenting Through Connection Instead of Coercion. Through Love Instead of Fear."" The book is absolutely phenomenal!! And unlike this book it not only leaves the child with his/her dignity in tact, by treating them with the same respect that God treats us with, but teaches the parent exactly how to form a very healthy intimate and mutually respectful bond (which yields to obedience by the way) that will last a lifetime between parent and child. Invaluable tools! Don't waste your money on Ms. Plowmans book. Children are too precious to hurt. There is a much better way, and your child will become a stronger, more self confident, happier individual...FOR LIFE !!"
1,1..2..3..Now I get to beat you,"Don't make me count to 3. How about just call the book, I like to beat my kids in the name of religion. My God is good and loving. He doesn't beat his children into submission, his little ""yes-people"". I don't like your god."
1,Child abuse is NOT discipline,"This book claims to advocate a heart-oriented philosophy, but in reality, she only promotes the use of violence and physical domination to create obedience. These methods have been proven to be dangerous and harmful, and should not be promoted in any way."
1,Let's hear from the experts,"This writer admits, ""I am not a parenting expert"". She also states, ""I wasn't always bordering on the brink of insanity."" I choose to take advice from sane experts, thank you."
1,Should Be MINUS One Star!!,"Simply put, this is just another child abuse manual! Perhaps I should count to three and give Ginger Plowman a dose of her own medicine! Imagine someone twice your size putting you over their knee and giving YOU a thrashing! This is indeed a very CRUEL book with the intention to HARM children! It makes me SICK!"
1,dont make me count to three,This book advocates child abuse and tries to make it a laughing matter. This author needs a view classes on child development. I am disappointed that amazon would carry this.
1,Advocates child abuse,"This book advocates child abuse. This author is an example of what happens to adults who have been hit in childhood. The anger and hate ferments in their hearts until they are adults and then they unleash all the hate and anger on their innocent children. That is really what this book is all about. This book has nothing to do with God and Christ. It has to do with a very sick woman who needs healing but instead of getting it, she chooses to abuse her children instead."
1,Never spank a child. Period.,You should not follow the advice of any parenting book that advocates spanking a child. It is not biblical or godly. God gives adults moral dilemmas daily. Teach your child to problem solve. It will serve them much better in iife.
1,A good review? Seriously?!?,"I find it hard to believe anyone would give a good review to a book that condones spanking a ten-month-old, let alone an author who provides a detailed description of ""baby whipping methods"" for readers.Sorry. Not my cup of tea."
5,Wonderful and Practical!,"This fast read by Ginger Plowman was excellent. Ginger is relatable and funny in her exposure of her own family and raising her children to be soldiers for Christ. She readily admits and helps the reader to identify errors in parenting that push our children away from us and then points us toward the remedy! This book is a good companion to Tedd Tripp's Shepherding a Child's Heart. The title says it all... ""a Mom's look at heart-oriented discipline."" Definitely worth the money!"
2,Spank to follow God,"While some of the ideas expressed in this book are good, I could not get beyond the fact that entire book talks about ""training"" your children. They are not animals to be trained. She also spends a chapter discussing using the ""rod"" for discipline and to stop short of that is disobeying God. I want to raise my children in the ways of God, but I don't think that involves spanking my children for every ""sin."" If I followed the advice of this book, my kids would be spanked many times a day."
1,Not Noteworthy,"This book is a restatement of Buffet style investing, offering no new ideas or concepts. I should have read the Intelligent Investor for the fourth time in lieu of reading this book."
3,Odd duplications,I'm now suspicious of this book based on the duplicate entries with 5 stars obviously written by the same people who didn't even bother to change their text in their reviews ...
2,Mediocre,"Her tone seemed condescending at times, and the book barely touched upon set up legalities, design, and customer retention.The message was lost in how the information was delivered in my opinion. It seems like the goodies were sprinkled between infomericals for her gift basket affiliate business.I found Shirley Frasier's 'How to start a home based gift basket business' (3rd ed.) a much better resource."
3,Disappointed,"To be honest I was disappointed in this book...I was looking for a book that would tell me how to create a gift basket instead I found a book that told mostly about marketing and general principals for running a business.It didn't even give the formula for how to price a basket, and very few resources were listed. I found How to Start a Home-Based Gift Basket Business, 2nd by Shirley George Frazier to be much more instructional and step-by-step.How to Start a Home-Based Gift Basket Business, 2nd"
4,Good Fundamentals,"I used this book as a psych resident starting out doing psychotherapy. It is great. Easy to read (mostly), easy to understand and gives basic fundamentals. The vignettes are great."
1,Doesn't come with a power adater,"The build quality looks good, and the disk is easy to install. But it doesn't ship with an AC power adapter so is totally useless for use with a laptop."
2,Hard to appreciate without prior knowledge of Rome's History,The Roman World is an overview of Roman art and history (alot to cover in one book). Without a solid background in Roman history it is very hard to keep up with this book. Lots of gaps that a scholar might be able to fill in but I had a very difficult time piecing everything together. Not for the casual reader.
2,not perfect,not all of the golf balls on the mold had very good raised spots to create the indentions so it would look like the golf ball. there were 3 that i was unable to use due to this. they created a smooth finish on the cake pops instead of the golf ball look
5,Eydie proves that she has the right to sing anything!,"This is one of Gorme's stellar discs. Her technical vocal skills and her incredible instinct with lyrics along with superb arrangements make this 5 stars. Gorme's versions of these classics make you forget Billie's, Barbra's & Lena's!"
5,Excellent 100% OK,"The first time that listened Portishead was 10 years ago. After time I saw Roseland NY and in theses days can bought the DVD. The productis 100% original, high quality and good price, It was very cheap. Now I can watch it all time that I like."
5,DELIRIOUS!!!,"The more I watch this video, the more it let me in complete ecstasy. All those uniques melodic patches only P can make - plus a complete orchestra - have the power to penetrate deep in your mind...so trippy! Like the great composers of the past centuries, if there's a band to be recognized in the future, this band is PORTISHEAD!!!"
5,Completely mind-blowing,"I have quickly gotten into Portishead in the past week, buying their two studio albums, this DVD and also the CD that was put out with 11 of the 15 tracks from the DVD. I watched this DVD last night and it was absolutely mind-blowing. It made me want to vomit it was so good. I can't believe I didn't know of Portishead before. While I watched it (and then the extras also), I couldn't believe that a band could be so good, so cool, so dark. There's not one happy song and every song is darker than black and just DIRTY. No modern band can touch this music. This DVD is insanely good. A must for anyone who knows good music."
5,Best coconut oil I have had in a long time,"I like the coconut fragrance and taste, plus the texture is great. It tastes good just eating a bit off of a spoon. Also use it in place of butter on my veggies.Purchased it locally for the first time yesterday. Much better product than the last jar of Tropical Traditions that I got. Will probably buy again when I gun out.If you want an oil with minimal taste and odor, get the Spectrum Refined oil that this same Amazon vendor sells."
2,SO-SO,"I've tried several brands of coconut oil and this one ranks at the bottom of the list. I eat coconut oil by the spoonful, and this brand is one of the few that didn't provide me with any noticeable results. Quality coconut provides me with the following benefits: energy, appetite suppresant, bowel movement, and just an overall feeling of well- being. This brand didn't do any of the aforementioned for me like other brands have done including Nutiva, tropical traditions, and vitacost. I would only use this as a moisturizer for my skin and hair. I wouldn't use it to reap the health benefits of coconut oil.I don't know if the nutrients were destroyed in the processing or what, but Spectrum Coconut oil only left me feeling so-so and hence the so-so rating."
3,"This one stands up to the others, but...","I've tried several brands of coconut oil, but this started out to be the best by far. It is creamy and less nutty tasting than the others, and was easier for me to consume than the others (I eat it right out of the jar). However, it caused me to have tickle in my throat...an annoying tickle that took an hour to go away. Granted, a coconut is a coconut is a coconut, and I know that other factors might play into the flavor of any of them. And granted, the next jar of Spectrum I buy might not have the same effect as the first, but for now, I'm rating this one in the mid range as far as how I like it, and that is simply because of that throat tickle thing. It's very annoying and distracting. Otherwise, initially, it has a smooth, creamy, fresh taste and I really do enjoy that part."
4,Wonderful for hair!,"EXTREMELY moisturizing for the hair. I have very thick, wavy, frizzy hair. And because i dye my hair alot it tends to get dry often. I use this right before i shampoo/condition and it is amazing! The only thing is its tastes kind of weird."
4,Great product,"I love this, clean fresh smells. I use it on everything, cooking, skin care as well as in the ""bedroom"". Amazing. I found this same product much cheaper in super market, paid 5.99. Amazon, lower the price please, some products price too high."
5,Love this product,"The coconut oil works much better than I had expected. My skin is so soft now, I use it right after showering and any other time I feel my skin needs more, no more flaking and itching dry skin. I developed my dry skin problem after having severe surgery, a long stay in the hospital and the loss of 30 lbs. from not being able to eat. The surgery was 18 months ago and I have been seaching for something to help my skin. I read about the wonders of coconut oil on the internet and decided to try it, I am so glad I did, I can definitely see and feel a difference. I will continue to use this brand of Virgin Coconut Oil forever. I researched coconut oil on Amazon, they had several options to chose from, I know I chose the right one for me, it is working miracles for my skin!"
3,More like a three and a half...,"OK, i dont know what you guys are smoking cause these guys aint better than underoath, especially if here their newest album, Define the Great Line. THis band aint bad, but personaly,most of their songs are a bit too short and i wish they would make them longer because most of them are like just at 3 minutes or a little less. Im hoping their next one(if they make a another CD) will be better than this one. Anyway, some of the stuff on this CD is a little unoriginal, but they aint bad, so buy this CD, because they are from my state, Georgia! Got to give the local band soem support, you know..."
1,Please enter a title for your review,"If you want a creativityless band incapable of writing a chord progression/riff/melody that deviates even slightly from conservative commercial formulas, pick this up. If you want another band jumping on the ""screamo"" trend without understanding it, and turning it into grungy commercial alt-rock, then pick this up. If you want watered down, processed, assembly line drivel passed off as creative self-expression then pick this up. Basically if you have contempt for everything punk, emo, hardcore, and metal are about and just wish it could all just be assimilated into basic thoughtless mainstream rock so you can understand and accept it better, then this band is what you've been looking for all your life. If you want good tunes, or any semblance of a honest, visceral edge, stay away from this band at all costs."
2,Not as good as the others,"The Ayurvedic incense is really good. These however, are not so great. I love flowers and their aroma, and I love smoky incense...but somehow these two do not combine well in these blends. They also have a tendency to smell alike.They're not terrible, but I won't be purchasing larger quantities of the flower/spice selections.I do, however, suggest the Ayurvedic 8 Fragrance Sampler Pack. (Not found on Amazon)."
2,If you want to be taken seriously - get an editor.,"Or at least a proofreader.It might make your book appear more credible.It's Hadrian's Wall - not Haiden's Wall, as the author referred to this historic structure repeatedly. This and other more routine typos made me wonder if such lack of attention to details carried over to any of the events described in the book.Her description of Chillingham Castle, especially, made me wonder if the castle is decorated in a creepy manner just to scare guests and she failed to pick up on this.Anyway, I hate to rate a book so low, but if the author doesn't take it seriously, I can't either."
3,"Its ok, for a start","I have been studying the world of the paranormal since I was roughly 9 years old growing up in my own ""haunted house"" I am now 36 years young, and have read allot on the subject and I cont. to collect books on the subjects...I find this book a bit more wordy on her were she went, her reactions, and little history. Its meat is not were you would expect it to be, in the stories which are short. I was left wanting more... maybe knowing that she is a gifted person, she didnt go into everything she knew I felt she kinda shorted the readers... it was like this in both works. Now you must understand that i have read this subject for years... so it maybe a good read for the beg. but not an advanced reader."
2,Mountainsmith Aurora II camera bag,"I had high expectations for this bag but ended up returning it immediately. The zippers would stick and the velco dividers on the interior did not hold very well. My 23 year old Lowepro bag is better made. However, the hip belt is well designed and hugs your body very well. In concept the bag is good but the assembly and sub-standard materials fail to make this product useful. I would stick with M-Rock, Lowepro or Tamrac, those bags are designed and used by the professionals. I believe Tamrac is still made in the USA. It would be a shame to miss a shot because your camera bag zipper got stuck. I can't recommend this product."
4,Very nice camera bag,"I chose this camera bag based on its measurements and shape, planning to use it with the shoulder strap rather than the hip belt. However, I discovered that folding the hip belt into the space provided made it too cumbersome, and I had to just cut it off. Other than that I like it very much. The zippered compartments work well for extra memory cards, batteries, lens cloth, etc. It is well padded, and the movable dividers allowed me to create a space to fit my Canon PowerShot SX20IS exactly. I also like the fact that it has a handle to use in place of the removable shoulder strap, if I wish to do so. I had to go to the Mountainsmith site to find the internal measurements to insure this bag would fulfill my needs. (Earlier, I had ordered another smaller model and incorrectly estimated the internal measurement based on the external measurements.)"
4,Barely Finished This One!,"While this book claimed to provide the inside story of the world's elite special forces, all it really did was highlite past missions. Between beraiding the US capabilities and predicting WWIII, Adams never really gives us any story that wasn't in the paper. Anyway, try the Commandos by Douglas Waller if you want a good account of US elite fighters."
3,"Nice album, but....","Ralph Blane did not write ""Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas."" Hugh Martin did. The song is legally credited to Martin/Blane, but Martin's biography details the songwriting process and Blane had very little to do with the song. Actually he only encouraged Martin to finish it. So to call the album the Ralph Blane Songbook really misrepresents the content of the album. A better title would be ""Plays the Hugh Martin and Ralph Blane Songbook."" The only track completely written by Blane was ""Buckle Down Winsaki,"" but even with that song I think Martin wrote down the music. I don't think Blane knew how to play an instrument or how to score a piece of music."
3,jewish heavy metal,"grinding metal guitar riffs. wobbly, off-kilter singing. awkward and confessional english lyrics with a smattering of hebrew all on the topic of becoming religious and getting in touch with one's jewish roots. and two tracks of dreamy new age music. it's and awkward kind of album, but it's metal enough to be metal and it's not written to be a novelty album and it comes from eth heart."
2,Boring slow wack,"never judge a book by its cover. I saw the cover and with all the high rating I figured cover looks fun, might have routines where your joints will be flexed, exercise will be applied repetition and strength will be obtain . Ohh was I wrong. It just scott sonnon in an empty room solo telling you and showing you some totally boring exercises . what a waste of money . Maybe if your an elderly , or middle age individual I'm sure it might work for you , but even then you should challenge yourself. The saying ""there's something for everyone "" surely didn't apply to me . There was nothing for me with this dvd."
5,Gorgeous!,"I don't usually buy actual CDs (prefer MP3 downloads), particularly ones that don't have samples available. Took a chance on this one and SO glad I did. This CD is soothing and gorgeous from start to finish, without being monotonous. Very grounding. Love it!"
5,Pure Magic,"This CD is just beyond words, you must hear it complete, it's soothing, it's calm, it's joyful, it's healing, it's serene, it's so beautiful, it's addictive-hypnotic, it's marvelous and uplifting, is like being surrounded by your mother's arms.If you want to make you a favor, PLEASE BUY IT !!!"
5,Amazing!,"this Cd is wonderful!!!! perfect to meditate! All recorded in the Hypogeum in Malta, a magic place to visit. Suggested to all Goddess loving people."
5,"Jennifer Berezan's ""Returning""","The first time I heard this album I was transported to another place between time. It was incredible! The combination of chanting and music that grows and builds upon one another is absolutely mesmerizing. I had to find out who this was and get the album. It really moved me, and continues to do so. I have shared it with friends who have had much the same response."
4,Good music/slight disappointment,"The music is wonderful, though I wasn't expecting the entire album to have the same phrase (less than 10 words) repeated throughout. I was disappointed that the CD case broke in several places once I opened it up for the first time."
4,Great atmosphere,"Great CD, helps creating a favorable atmosphere for relaxation and qi gong routines. Amazing sound, because it was recorded in one of the world's oldest temples, in a chamber created for sound (in Malta). A good CD to have in your collection!"
2,Not for beginners,"This book is not step by step to drawing, if anything its a study or reference guide. Giving you a few skeletons and a few pictures isnt a how to draw book. If you want to learn to draw animals, better to find another book. If your a skilled artist and looking to improve, you might enjoy this. Personally though, I only recommend it for children to look at prety pictures."
2,Not this one!!,"I have ordered several ""How-To-Draw"" books by Dover that were all great informative step-by-step instructions, this is NOT one of them. This is a small book of very small illustrations of animals. There is no step-by-step method, there is no written instruction. I could have just looked up various animals in a book about animals. Very disappointing but in all fairness, everything else I own from Dover has been exceptional quality. I don't know what happened when this one hit the presses, the boss must have been on vacation!"
3,"Beautiful artwork, but...","This ""how to draw"" book is packed with some awesome animals drawings, but there's not a lot of ""how to"" to it. No steps, no ideas or concepts, just a lot of simple (complete) drawings."
1,Picture Book,"This book claims to be a book on how to draw animals, however it is nothing more than drawn pictures of animals. There is no step by step, only images of animals in different posses. I would not recommend this book."
1,the 50's Decade Country Hits TFD67122,"This CD is an example of artists who have had previous gold or platinum recordings, and now have ruined their original master recording sales by putting out a product that if originally release in this capacity would have wound up in the radio stations trash basket. We are quite sorry to see artists like : Don Gibson and Mitchell Torok, who appear to have been desperate to participate in such a CD release as this one.The Music ReviewMusic EditorChanceworth Thomas"
2,Not the Originals,While these songs look good they are re-recordings.So take this into consideration when contemplating a purchase.
4,Deck of Cards makes a worthy purchase,Deck of Cards by Wink Martindale still moves me..an soldier's parallel of a deck of cards to a Bible/prayerbook/almanac...Gonna find me A Bluebird and Oh Lonesome Me are a bonus on this inexpensive cd collection..definitely a good buy for $5.00
2,Good for farm/outdoor work!,The boots were very heavy duty and way to big. I would suggest sizing down. The would be a great outdoor work boot. Not just for the 'city'.
3,Okay...,"Keeps my feet dry, but I bought men's boots thinking there would be a large calf circumference to fit my legs plus whatever kind of pants I wear. The calf opening is actually on the slender side and fits much like women's rain boots. There is no lining inside the boot either so when I put my foot in the boot my socks get tugged upwards and feel really tight and awkward on my feet."
3,Not like the picture,"The boots are indeed black, but the picture makes the leg of the boot look slender and stylish. The boot is actually quite bulky and unflattering. It also has a horrid industrial smell the took over my bedroom. I have to leave the boots on the balcony due to the smell."
3,Unsure,"I gave these as a gift to my dad who sometimes has to work in the mud. He said the boots were nice but showed me how difficult they are to get off after just slipping them on, he advised me that after working in them and your feet sweating unless you have someone to pull them off- you cant get them off yourself. So i was a bit disappointed. But they are very well made and nice this is the only draw back. Also was disappointed that after i purchased them, i was researching them on another website and found them for half the cost- that did not make me happy at all."
1,Size is larger than standard size,"I am a male and normally ware shoes of size 8. However, when I order this one, it is substantially larger than it should be. My feet measures 9.5 inches and the websites says 10 inches for size 8. But when it arrives, it measures more than 11 inches. So big that I need to return it right away. My field trip comes in one week and this put me in a bad situation. Buyers be aware and it is generally not a good thing for online buying with a non-standard size info."
3,Sized for Men,These arrived promptly and looked just as they do in the pictures but I was highly disappointed to find that these are in men's sizes. Please be aware of that before you buy them. The other comments seem to imply they are in women's sizes. Not so.
2,Blisters,"I know i starred them low, but they are no that bad of boots. They are ridged black PVC boots that smell like the devil when they get to you (plasticy smell). they are tough thus far. A little narrow in mens 11s. The only draw back is because they are tough, they are pretty ridged, this has cut blisters in my feet. I figure i will callus up, so whatever, but i really do not look forward to putting on these boots right now. Tough goes both ways boys and girls."
4,Size info correction,"The Tingley men's black 15"" tall economy PVC boots are plain, sturdy work boots with a decent tread. I ordered a men's size 6 hoping to approximate a women's size 8. The boot is about a size longer than I need and wider than medium width. I can compensate by wearing thick socks and / or adding an insole. The shaft is quite generous and wide so these are not close fitting ""fashion boots."" Overall, useful boots and budget friendly price."
4,They'll do the job. Sturdy enough,"They're about as basic a rubber boot as I can think of, but definitely the cheapest I could find and they are thick. I at least don't imagine them wearing out or forming a hole any time soon. I read someone else's review about them being flimsy. I bought them anticipating this, but mine are pretty sturdy. Perhaps they bend a bit. I definitely would order one size smaller than daily shoes. I wear shoe size 11 and the 10's are nearly right on... maybe could have even ordered a 9.5 had they'd been offered."
2,You get what you paid for.,"These keep out water and such fine enough. However, the inside is not completely smooth, and there were points in the inside that stuck inward, giving my legs small scabs in extended walks. They were uncomfortable in general. I looked for a particularly cheap pair of boots, and these do suffice for that. They're good for short walks through high rain or snow, but you get what you pay for."
4,rain boots,I bought these boots for my husband and he said they run a bit narrow but he likes them and they were a good purchase for the price.
4,Order them two sizes smaller,I went with half a size smaller and they're big. Still wearable though and as an unknown at purchase added bonus the boots are steeltoed.
4,rainboots,"other than being incredibly foul smelling, of fuel of somesort. These boots seem awesome. My son needs them for boarding school and I bought a pair to grow into as well."
4,Well Made,I purchased this product to use in acid washing my pool. They fit great and have a knee high length to keep the splashes off my clothing. Good Quality and slip resistant.
5,great boots,"Great boots. My husband loves them. Fit well, keep the rain out. Wish his raincoat came down to the boots so his knees wouldn't get wet. He can get his pants over them as well, so when he's inside, he doesn't need to change right away and you can't tell he's wearing boots."
3,Run really big!,"These run big - I do have slender feet though.I typically wear a size 10, but the 10s are pretty big. Ordered a size 9 to see which fits better.One of them will go back.They're a great buy for the price! Can't wait to take them fishing."
3,Gets Predictable,It doesn`t take long to see the predictable turns in this movie. Hanzo the Snare shows some cruel parts that may be very hard to watch for Western Audiences. This movie is not the worst but is definitely not the best either. The only thing genius about it is the torture.
5,Really great toy,"The handle tends to come off, but that's the only bad thing i can say about it. I bought it for my 15 month old and she LOVES it! She is young for it but she loves to put all the figures in the shoe and then take them all out again. If you child likes little people then this toy would be great for them. The figures are really cute. She'll grow into the pretend part...but for now she is learning how to open and close the does and different parts of the shoe. She love the little fairy noise it makes. I may get the iplay cottage down the road to add to her village...but having to pick just one I recommend this one."
1,The new edition is a lot worse than the earlier editions,"I have found the book very difficult to follow. The book reads more like a research paper than a textbook, in both style and content (for example, there are too many references, most of which are completely unnecesary). Many symbols are left undefined. There are many gaps in the derivations. Many concepts (e.g. the Maragoni effect) are introduced out of proper context. I would not recommend it to anybody. Get an earlier edition if you can."
1,Physical Chemistry of Surfaces,"I used this book as a text in my class 'Physical Chemistry of Liquids, Interfaces, and Colloids'. This book is not a textbook. My students are complaining all the time about the presentation of topics as well as the extent of derivations, interpretations, and lack of examples. I must admit that I have made a mistake for choosing this text for my course. If you are planing to use it as a text, please go through a few of the derivations and you will notice that the book offers very little to a student."
1,Compilation of Journal Articles,"The Author often mentions different proteins/chemicals were used in an experiment (site ref. [1,3,6]) and doesn't mention what the proteins are how they affected the experiment simply states, ""An experiment involving this protein was performed to determine ____________ as shown in ref [6,23,76]"" Do not recommend the book for learning purposes but as an index for jounal articles in this field."
1,Makes me want to rip my hair out,"I couldn't agree more with previous reviews of this book. For the average student, it is very difficult to follow. The derivations are not clear and many terms are not clearly defined, leaving you flipping back through the textbook to find where the term was first referenced. There are no example problems either, leaving the reader wondering how and if the numerous equations are actually used. It is worse than reading the appendix of a calculus textbook. I would not recommend this book to anyone."
3,Way overpriced for a piece of history,"Why pay over $100 for a movie that you can watch on Netflix? I love Black history but someone trying to gain this much of a profeit over a simple $10 dvd should be ashamed of themselves. Not worth that much, read a book."
5,TIME TO REPRINT THIS ESSENTIAL DVD!!!!!,"Yo, I've seen this on VHS several times and it never ceases to touch me. Sure, it takes some liberties in simplifying things but people don't seem to make that criticism when it supports their political views ... such are the realities of the narrative form necessary to movies, novels, etc. This isn't a dry, academic account. It asks you to identify with the Black characters in this film, and not with the FBI oreo or the white pigs. There are some elements here of the blaxploitation genre, of which Melvin Van Peebles (with his ""Sweet Sweetback's Baaadaaassss Song"") was an, or should I say THE, originator. No one would accuse ""Sweetback"" of being an ""objective"" account but it does grasp something real in the experience of Blacks in Amerikkka. The soundtrack CD to this movie, and the CD ""Pump Ya Fist"" (co-produced by Mario Van Peebles) are also essential!!!"
4,fear of a black planet,"this just goes to show you that whenever my folks speak about something other then what was taught to them to say, america gets nervous. the black panters was one of the greatest things to happen to the ""real"" upliftment"" of africans. this movie is just as good as andy kaufman, hoffa, the patriot, and any other good ole' ""american"" movie. but it just so happens that this movies teaches blacks that together as one we can control our destiny. and that my friends scares amerikkka."
3,$200 for a movie that is 13 years old!!!!,"Who is charging that much for Panther, a very good movie but there are better movies that are MUCH cheaper on Amazon! I wanted to order this movie from amazon, but it's way too high, it's got to be a mistake. My grocery bill is way cheaper that that!"
1,Will Give Away For Free,"If I ever find a copy of this DVD, I will give it away for free!! The price for this is ridiculous."
1,not good.,"First the dvd would not play in my player. Instead of it being in english like I wanted, it was in German. I would seriouslly review the outfits you do business with."
2,very average,i'm a big fan of the Van Pebbles.Melvin the Father is a Ground-breaker for African-American films.Mario is challenging.i've read many books on the Panthers the good&the Bad on them.i wish this film had done the same.i Respect what The Panthers were trying to Establish but it's important to show both sides to the story.still it's better than nothing.this is American History.
5,The film does what it is supposed to do..,"This film does not tell the entire story of the Black Panther Party. No film could realistically scrape the surface of the party's vast history. What this film does do is peak curiosity. It causes one to think. It causes one to explore how history (black history in particular) has been portrayed in America. Simply put, Panther is one of the top 5 most powerful films I have ever seen (the other four are Rosewood, Malcolm X, Amistad, and Roots, in no particular order)."
3,Could have been a lot better,"No, I'm obviously not THAT Huey. I use this TAG out of repsect. This movie could have been and should have been a lot better. It's based more on Mario's book than on what really happened. The real Panthers were a lot more organized and a lot more diciplined than they are portrayed in this movie. The movie it self is a good vehicle for giving some indication about where the Panthers were coming from, but in final analysis it only scratched the surface and never got to the nitty or the gritty. Too Holywood. I highly recommend ""Public Enemy"". It's a documentary which is fully endorsed by Bobby Seale and made available on his website. Real Deal, sho nuff. X"
2,A Bummer,"I bought a PSAP1 because Paul Stanley is the best! I thought if he endorses it, then it must be a decent guitar. I played it for a while, but I really don't like the shape of the neck. The frets are barely even and the neck is slightly bowed so the strings buzz. When I plugged it in my amp, it sure didn't sound like Stanley's. At least it looks good."
4,cat stuffed animal as companion for little one,"This stuffed animal is cute for a pet or small child to cuddle with or look at. They're a pretty stuffed animal. But if the child or pet is too playful, after a while the beans can fall out. So far my little one has just looked at this stuffed animal. But there was another one that fell apart from use, and the beans started falling out."
3,Book purchase,"The seller that I purchased this item from sent it out quickly, as I received it promptly after I purchased it. I appreciate the quick response.And it is the title that I was looking for regarding family history.My mistake was not thoroughly reading the information about the book on the website page.The book is complete and in fairly good condition for it's age, but it is a former library book with library markings and I didn't want a former library book.But that is my mistake for not emailing the seller with questions about the title before purchasing it. I also was lax on thoroughly searchingthe sale page for further condition information.Because it is a book on family history, I decided to keep this copy.I will be more careful next time."
4,Too little of a good thing,"If you want great music, get this group. HOWEVER, there are other CDs by this group that have more tracks. I bought mine in the late 90s and it only has 10 songs. Now I see that there is one which has 25 tracks AND costs less.Great brassy music. It'll have you singing along, guaranteed."
1,Not worth it,"I bought this to continue using Mini DV tapes and, for the first year it worked fine. Then abruptly, just after the warranty crumped out, the cassette door will not close. Quotes for repair equal or exceed the original cost. That's it for me with lightweight Sony products. However, I do need to accept some blame for not checking out the forums and complaints first on the Internet -- there are MANY people with this same problem and no solutions for this specific model."
1,Obsolete,"I bought this Camcorder a few years ago, just before losing my job. I used the USB streaming to transfer lower quality video to my computer for those years, and just purchased a nice Win7 64-bit computer with iLink (aka FireWire). The computer won't recognize the camera over iLink, and USB streaming isn't supported in Win7 at all, (and never has been for any 64-bit operating systems). Of course, their warranty is only for 90-days. After spending three days searching for solutions, I find I'm sitting on a bunch of miniDV tapes with only the potential of youTube quality videos from my old computer. This is not what I expected from an expensive, brand-name Camcorder. My regular, inexpensive point-and-shoot digital camera does better at getting video on my computer than the HandyCam does."
1,Junk,"First I kept getting re-insert the tape messages, now it won't even load the tape. Also, it now keeps giving me re-attach power source messages. Have been very careful with it, it worked OK for about a year. This is my second Sony camcorder, it will be the last."
2,bad experience,"I had a bad experience with this camera. The mini dv ""tape"" got stuck in the camcorder and would not eject rendering it useless and too expensive to repair. I also found it cumbersome and extremely difficult to use with my Mac. I just purchased a Flip Mino HD which is much better suited to my needs..."
4,Sony minicam,"The Sony minicam that we ordered work very well. We use it to capture video for sports analysis. To do this we need a minicam that has a FireWire port. The camera that we ordered was shown with the port and came properly packed and in good working order. It included a note from the vendor that if we had any problem with it, return it within 30 days. The unit is working well and we are very pleased with our purchase."
4,Great Camera for the price,"I brought this camera to film moments of me and my buddies playing sports. The quality, sound and picture of each came out excellent. The stablization is amazing and the color jumps off the screen. I really love the touch screen controls on the camera. It doesn't give you the HD quality you expect from most of the cameras out today but the picture is almost as good. It's great for small events and its light weight and small. It has a very nice battery life. It's easy to edit and change the video using the software provided. It uses mini Dv tapes, which from what i researched seem to be the best and most popular type for a camcorder at the time."
2,Lacking,"I had owned a SonyDCR-HC20, which was stolen. I assumed this would be a step up from that. In some ways, I suppose it is, but in many ways it is not.It feels like a cheap camera, with its clunky plastic case. Recording in low light situations is a particular challenge. And I was startled to find that this camcorder, unlike many of its rivals, has no remote control! For that reason alone I'll be returning this little disappointment ASAP."
1,I returned it immediately,The product was so cheaply built that I thought for a minute I'd accidentally ordered a child's play camera. I returned it immediately.
4,Definitely worth the price!,"The Sony DCR-HC38 camcorder is a great little video camera. I have used it quite often since the purchase and even for someone who is not very adept working electronic equipment, it is easy to operate yet takes great videos! I highly recommend this camera, it's certainly worth the cost!"
1,Wrong item description,"Scotch-Brite Sponge RefillThe Scotch-Brite Sponge Refill listed on this page does NOT appear to be the ""SPONGE"" refill (3M#481-7-RSC)sold for this product, but rather the ""SCRUBBER"" refill (3M#482-7-RSC). The scrubber refill scratches teflon and other delicate surfaces, so I want the sponge refill - but you don't seem to carry it. The part number should be listed with the product to eliminate confusion.Scotch-Brite Sponge Refill"
3,not as good as the 1st 1,"There was very little action and I remember thinking ""that's it?"". I was a little disappointed, but I guess. That's as good as sequels go."
1,Big Problem,"I am an active woodworker and use dado blades all the time. I purchased this dado set to replace an identical older CMT set which worked fine for many years. After wondering why my dados weren't working out, I measured the core blade and tooth thickness and discovered that they were wrong. For example, two blades plus four chippers will not cut a 3/4-inch dado. I called CMT about this, and they acknowledged that something was wrong (they had received similar calls)but they did not offer any help in resolving the problem. I will never buy another CMT blade..."
2,Not great quality,"I don't know what to say about this dvd. It has episodes, but these weird real person and puppet skits in between that my kids hate. The quality of the video is not that great. It is almost not clear. My kids like Caillou, but this dvd is not press play and leave it. I have to skip past all the skits, etc. There are puppets!!!!"
1,Pass on this one!,"This is one of the Caillou's where he is whining and half of the DVD is puppets. My grandson hates the puppets and had I realized this, I would not have purchased it."
5,I can't believe this didn't become a series!,"Screw-on Head is one of the funniest TV pilots ever made. Fantastic cast, wonderful script, charming art - an all-around lovely experience. We laugh every time we watch it."
3,Any last words before I spark it?,"This is one funny cartoon. It's some great Mignola. The only downside is there's only one episode on the disc (hence only three stars), but there does seem to be some promise of more in the future... I can only hope. Anyways, I thought it was worth it. I also got the Hellboy Sword of Storms at the same time. It's also good, but not quite as entertaining.If you're gonna get one, get them both. It helps to justify the expense.""And who says smoking people is bad for you?"" - Emperor Zombie"
4,Results are variable,"I have irritable bowel syndrome (which, I think, means they don't know what's wrong).Doctor told me that if I got plugged up for more than 4 days, I should ""do somethingabout it."" He didn't say what.So I tried Kroger bisocodyl. TAAA DAAA. It worked. No cramps, no problems.However the results are quite variable. It may do nothing, or it may really work.Never had any pain from it. Just a lot of rumbling down there.I asked the doctor about it, and he looked pained, and finally said that it probablywouldn't hurt me any.End of saga.Jerry ODell"
1,"Great Blender, horrific Jar, no replacement parts available","Love the Blender. The jar handle broke within the first couple months. The jar has continued a collection of micro cracks until now, when is simple leaks like a sieve. No replacement parts available. I'm desperate, if your motor died, and you have a jar, I would love to get my hands on it. I'll try some appoxy solutions."
1,POS,Powerful motor but the canister cracks and you cannot get a replacement part for love or money. Don't buy this Piece of S.
2,Great Blender-- BAD Canister!,"Purchased this blender, loved it, but after about 6 months, the poly canister cracked. I had been both placing it in the dishwasher (which it says is fine) and even hand washing it at times. After searching online, I found this is a common design flaw with this blender--many others have had the canister crack too. Too bad...I really liked how it worked otherwise. Now what do I do? Buy another? yuck."
2,similar story,"Bought this at Costco, after 2 months the jar cracked and leaked. It was never used to process ice, some frozen berries and well-soaked almonds was as tough as it got. Pity, the base is solid, the unit is quiet, and the blending was all we needed."
4,Simply Bewitching,"The Witch's Handbook is a wonderfully fantastic fictitious piece, assembling bits and pieces of witchcraft-related information in the forms of illustrations, activities, recipees, and magic-know how indexes. Though it was written to appeal to children, its jovial approach of mock sincerity will be appreciated by readers of all ages. A truly fabulous book."
2,Just plain blah,If you don't already own a collection of Elmo DVDs don't make this one the first one you get. There are much better ones out there. Out of the 7 or 8 we own this is by far the most boring.
5,massage natures touch,"this cd is very relaxing and soothing.you hear the sound of water running from a stream nearby ,with bird sounds and the music playing with an oriental flare.when you close your eyes while listening , you feel like you are somewhere in a fairy tale place, with the greenest trees and the sun shinning so soft and bright. we use this tape to practice tai chi."
4,Unflinching exploration of gender in Francophone West Africa,"Calixthe Beyala has an unflinching, raw way of exploring gender and exploitation of women by family and men. I admired this rawness but I felt that as the story progressed the scenes of abuse, of sex, of scatological references, became so frequent that they lost their power. Instead of moving me, they merely irritated me. Characters often read as if the writer could not resist having them be the worst they could possibly be.The writing was interesting, with nice turns of phrase, although there were too many one-word sentences. Above all, there was that unapologetically angry sense underlying the story that impressed me very much. It is as if Beyala, in this book, refuses to make nice, chooses her own honesty above anything else, and for this she gets my respect."
4,"Unique, Moving Portrait of the Holocaust","A Book of Songs by Merritt Linn is a marvelous book. It is the story of survival in all senses of that word; physical, emotional, but especially spiritual. It traces the story of Jews in a forced labour camp and the small child playing the violin who appears to them. The originality in the characters and the vivid details of the situation sets this book apart from others covering similar material. It goes beyond merely the sheer horror of the situation and finds the novel's life in the individual characters trapped within that situation. The story finds its universal message not through a grand design but through finding the uniqueness of the individuals in small, personal ways. A truly touching work."
3,Review for Yang The Third And Her Impossible Family,"I thought this book was a great way to describe what it feels like to try to fit in. This book was very funny, and I think that young readers will enjoy it. This book is about a girl from China who has 3 siblings who are all trying to fit in with Americans. The girl named Mary adopts a cat, and her parents don't know about it."
4,Yang The Third,"Yang The Third And Her Impossible Family is a really good book. It has a lot of cool stuff that tells you how Chinese families are and aren't like American families. There are also some problems that happen during the book, like how she keeps the cat a secret. Also, how to make friends with Holly."
1,Worst CD I Ever Purchased,"I would rate the ""Banana Boat Song"" as the best cut on the album and would only give it a 2 Star rating. I am surprised that the CD even got to market, and more surprised that someone with SteveLawrence's talent would let it be released. I doubt that of the 15 titles recorded on the CD that any one of them ever made the top 500 list (if there is such a thing). A really bad CD."
2,Not the SNES game,"I bought this thinking it would be similar at least to the Super Nintendo version I played through dozens of times as a kid.It is NOT the same game.Overall a fair side-scrolling Game Boy game, but it doesn't recreate the magic of the movie while still adding elements & characters/bosses unique to the game like the SNES version did.Quite disappointing but still an okay game.For the Super Nintendo version, click here:Hook"
3,Very good,"I thought this movie was pretty realistic. I happen to be nearly 26 years old myself, jewish, and yes a virgin. This movie gives me some hope of finding someone. There are older virgins out there in today's world.The ending could have been better, however. She decides she loves someone (I won't give away who) for no apparent reason for this ephifany. She tells him, and that's pretty much the end- another twenty minutes of them together, and some real showing of her love for him would have been nice.Further, in a conversation with one of her friends she berats him for keeping his women friends seperate from his lovers. But, this is hypocritical- she's doing the exact same thing. This annoys me."
4,I don't think of you that way!,"Rarely is there a movie that comes along that has the message that this movie has. Want you want is what you need, just because everyone else is doing it, that does not mean you must participate in what everyone else is doing. Seeing behind the outward appearence, we see a woman who is conflicted about her feelings and how she wants to react to them. This movie shows that sometimes when you want something so much, you will overlook the most obvious solutions to you probelms and your happines can elude you due to your narrow focus on the prize."
1,Not satisfied,DVD set is ok if you don't mind the English accent. Honestly there's better DVDs out there. Just my opinion.
1,Shouldn't have been published,"Perhaps the single worst authored textbook I have come across. No doubt the author is bright, but he is no instructor and hasn't the skill set to convey topics clearly or effectively. If you are trying to learn microe' - do yourself a favor and search elsewhere."
4,Track Listing:,Track Listing:1. Yours - tobyMac2. Tonight - PAX2173. Say It Loud - Sanctus Real4. Up and At 'Em - John Reuben5. Amazing - Andy Hunter6. I Don't Care (Pointing Fingers) - Justifide7.

2,Not Hall & Oates,"Like many Hall & Oates fans, I have been fooled by John Madara's marketing of these tracks. The truth is Daryl & John never wanted this collection of mostly rough demos to be released but Madara owned the rights. The songs ""A Lot Of Changes Comin'"" & ""The Reason Why"" are unreleased Gulliver tracks NOT Hall & Oates. ""The Provider"" is a Daryl Hall solo song written by Andy Robinson. The song ""Angelina is technically a demo cover of the Gulliver track in which Tim Moore wrote and sings lead - this demo version Daryl Hall sings."
2,Finally out on Cd!,"the early years of Hall and oates, there is a Great track here ""past times behind"", wonderful song!, the rest of the material sounds like unfocused folk music, also poor production."
1,A ripoff,"Add this to the list of sleazy attempts to separate baby-boomers from their money by selling a recording with the names and song titles of the records we remember so well, but which bear little or no resemblance to the original performances. I think a couple of these tracks might be the originals, for example Johnny and the Hurricanes' ""Red River Rock."" But the two Danny and the Juniors tracks, ""At the Hop"" and ""Rock and Roll is Here to Stay,"" sound very much as if they were performed by Danny and the Seniors - Seniors who have lost every ounce of the spirit and energy they had back in 1958. And for anyone who remembers the original ""Yakety-Yak,"" this recording might make you physically retch.Stay away!"
2,Good for a laugh watching my cat tear it apart,We have two cats. They cry at the bedroom door every morning at 5AM. This feeding system stopped them from crying by gaining their attention and contemplation of how to open this new puzzle. The slammed it around and pried it open. I would have been mad but it was really funny . The machine was contorted and pulled apart all sorts of way. If you buy this and your cat is a fat pig then you will need to use two sided tape to secure the device to the ground and face the opening snug against the wall. This is the only hope you have. By the way cat is psycho ! Lord please save us.
2,Clumsy,"The timer, not being digital, cannot be set for the exact time. That's OK once you get used to it, but replacing the battery every 2 weeks is not acceptable. The literature said the battery would last for about a year with continuous use. With just 1 month of use, the battery had to be replaced twice. If you can't count on the device working, it's of no use."
2,size suggestion,"I ordered this product and measured my waist as instructed. Well i couldn't even pull it together to fasten it! I suggest you get yourself at least one size larger than recommneded. I say this b/c now I have to send it back, (excuse me..pay to send it back), wait on a credit back to my card, then RE-ORDER, then wait on it to arrive all over again. Not to mention..you better do it within 15 SHORT DAYS OF PURCHASE, otherwise you will not be getting a refund!!! If I knew that I would have never ordered..that tells me the manufacture doesn't have much faith in it's product!"
4,Great product,"I ordered these after trying a cheaper alternative. The alternative didn't fit properly and looked terrible. The Bushwackers defintely follow the body lines of the truck. Great look. The only negative is the price. They cost at least twice as much they should. In the end though, the fact that they are on an expensive truck, they provide some additional protection and look awesome somewhat offsets the price. Bottom line; I would, reluctantly buy them again because there is no alternative worth even half the money."
4,Bizarrely enough this 1948 version of The Three Musketeers reminds me a bit of . . .,"KILL BILL Vol. 1 & 2. Both heroes and villains alike in this film are killers. Lana Turner as Milady, and Vincent Price as Richelieu are deliciously fun as villains. Gene Kelly's D'Artagnan sword fight scenes are truly awesome! They honestly hold up against anything excellent that's being done in action sequences today, seriously bordering on ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" type fight scenes.Unfortunately, it's not quite long enough for us to truly invest in D'Artagnan's Beatrix Kiddo like character. Only Van Heflin's portrayal of Athos imparts true emotional substance as one of the alleged heroes in this film. Athos is forever tormented by his love for cold blooded killer/assassin Milady, a bit like Beatrix and Bill in ""KILL BILL"" as well. Meanwhile, D'Artagnan barely has time to flinch when his beloved newlywed wife Constance is murdered at the hands of Milady."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"Although it appears that this CD is a compilation of hits by the original artists, it is actually a brand new recording with music that tries to sound like the original hits. If you're looking for the real thing, look elsewhere. If you're looking for some sound-alike elevator music, this is the CD for you!"
4,Children love to peek and find,"I am a reading teacher. Finding reading materials for young readers is often dificult. Pop-up books are typically enticing to pre-school, and low level primary school readers. The ""Peek and Find"" books combine enticement with a good reading lesson. Readers are confronted with clues to the identity of the hidden characters. When the reader opens the flap, his guesses are confirmed.Bright colors, simple text, clear dialogue and an easy to follow plot make reading the books fun for early readers. ""An Adventure with Winnie the Wolf"", is an excellent book for parents to read to their children as early as six months of age. Large type, and primary school level vocabulary makes this book a good book for teaching young readers to enjoy reading."
3,false advertising,"they say on the package this brush will make your hair more shiny and will reduce static. in fact, it increased the static in my hair. if i brush it a couple times, i will actually get shocked when i touch the brush.it's not a huge problem, and i'm not going to buy another brush, but i did expect more from all the fantastic claims made on the package."
1,Don't waste your time with Newman,"Anyone interested in Newman's books should take a look at what Jim Quinn says about him in _American Tongue and Cheek: A Populist's Guide to Our Language_ (1980, and unfortunately out of print). Quinn shows that Newman doesn't check his facts. Newman claims, for example, that the word ""rhetoric"" to mean ""empty or dishonest language"" is a recent use among politicians and journalists, a use which threatens the rhetoric's true meaning as ""effective use of language and the study of that use."" Quinn, however, shows that Newman is wrong that ""rhetoric"" has only recently been used to refer to false or misleading language, since the OED records that the word has been used in that way since 1562. Quinn shows that Newman's books are full of these kinds of mistakes. Newman shouldn't be taken seriously as an expert about usage and grammar."
3,cannoli,"Nice music. It's what I remembered growing up. Very calm elevator music. If you want to hear a trumpet player with great technique, don't buy this CD."
2,Sonic snoredom.,"As a fan of pop instrumental slush, I expected to enjoy this CD, but it nearly put me to sleep. Kaempfert's sound is reprocessed big band music, with reluctant choirs straining not to crack a dynamic while corny, Dixieland-style bass charts thunk away. You get the feeling that if someone clunked, whispered, or root-tooted out of order, that something very, very bad would happen--something more drastic than a retake. Punishment, perhaps. It's just the feeling I get when I listen to this stuff.But maybe it takes supreme discipline to create ""happy"" music. I'm frankly surprised that such spirited trumpet work and snappy rhythms can have such a soporific impact, but I snorely--er, sorely--needed some caffeine therapy after listening to this. Kaempfert makes The Ray Conniff Singers sound like Aerosmith."
5,Another distinctive Big Band sound!,"This is another outstanding arranger that rivals the initial fresh sound of the Glen Miller, Sammy Kaye, etc., big bands of the '40's. His soft brass instruments and choral group makes this band easy to listen to."
5,Best of Bert Kaempfert,A distinctive approach to easy listening. Surprisingly good together with Glen Miller and Tijuana brass. Upbeat but mellow. Great listening.
5,Bert Kaempfert,This is the best of his hits and I love the album. I was amazed at some of the tunes that became TV staples.
5,Bert as only he could play,"As far as I am concerned, Bert Kaempfert had the greatest orchestra of the 60's and early 70's. ANY album of his is great!"
5,Great Sounds,"If you like soft sounds from the 60's and 70's, this is THE album for you. Memories flooded over me in wondrous waves when I listened to this CD."
4,it means africa,"african beat; it's the music i have been searching for since years and found it thanks to amazon.I needed it as a background to the film i shot in tanzania.""African beat"" and ""swinging safari"" both take me directly back to the immense serengeti plains and i feel like being there again."
5,Great Gift,Gave this CD to my Mother for Mothers day. She loves it! When the first song came on she and my Dad starting dancing. She's 76 and he's 82. It's a great CD for anyone but a great gift for seniors as well.
4,Memories of Special Dances of Youth,"This music was played at special dances during holidays when I was a teenager. It had special memories for me. It will be enjoyed at a special occasion this winter. It is refreshing to hear good music without singing once in awhile. Anyone that grew up in the 60's probably remembers. Great music to dance to, I plan to purchase others."
2,Object Lessons for Shallow Sermons,"This book might be useful to touchy-feely groups or those who merely skim the surface of Scripture. There is little here for the indepth Bible-oriented preacher.Although object lessons can be useful in holding attention or making points, the material here involves volunteers coming forward for this or a brief skit on that. This is for the attention deficit crowd.I would suggest the object lesson series published by Baker, such as, ""Simple Object Lessons for Children."" These make simple and brief points and keep the sermon interesting without turning it into a game show."
2,Fabricating Printed Circuit Boards,This is a 236 page book. The first 106 pages describe the author's preferred method of making PCB's using photo sensitized boards. Other DIY methods are mentioned in passing and rejected as being flawed. The next 118 pages describe the workings and construction of a data logger that the author's company makes. The final 12 pages are the glossary and index. If you're into building the author's data logger you've got the right book but for reading a thorough description of PCB methods (as the title and ed. review would lead you to believe) I believe you'll be disappointed. Bait and switch.
3,Ordinary,All the info in this book can be found for free on the internet. OK to have if you want a bound volume on the subject matter.
2,Limited information on latest PCB fabrication,This book only describes the basic of PCB fabrication. Does not update to current and latest technology. Only recommend this book if you are looking to build PCB from home.
2,"Not easy to read, not simple to use","These dip sticks to test pool/spa chemical levels are not simple to use: must be swirled around 3X at specific water depth, lifted out of water, not shaken, held perfectly level, and read immediately. The five pads are hard to read after dipping: individual pad colors often are uneven, that is, will show two colors at once, not uniform enough to identify a specific color/result. Results are not consistent, such if doing a second test after the first. Also, pads don't seem to be very absorbent - colored water bleeds from one pad into adjacent pads, I'm sure affecting results."
1,pointless gimmick,"Colors bleed and to judge the quality of water by shade of a color is ridiculous. For some reason I thought there would be better logic to this test kit like black if something is wrong and white if it's good. In this test, you go by shades of the same color. There is no way this would ever be possible due to color bleeding. How in the world can it be accurate to compare light orange as bad to light medium orange as good? This is junk."
2,"These weren't very good now, were they?","Yes, these are not very good. While the Alkalinity, pH and Calcium Hardness seemed to work ok, the colors are too difficult to match and a given color can include a large range of readings, and give you no way to figure out what amount of chemical(s) would correctly balance your pool water.The Free and Total Chlorine squares are way off - told me I had absolutely none of either, whereas my regular pool test kit (as well as the local pool store) showed my chlorine levels to be in the correct range.Better to go with a standard liquid drops test kit, with demand reagents, so you know how much of whatever chemical to put in.I cannot recommend these for pool maintenance."
2,just ok,"These test strips do the job. However they run really quickly giving you very little time to read the results. I probably wouldn't buy them again, but I will use them before purchasing more."
5,Carlene at her best,"I have only recently discovered Carlene but have found that her music is very much to my liking,she has a style that is very easy to listen to and do like a singer who can also write the songs,this is a CD that i play often and i think she should appeal to many people.I wish there was a DVD of her."
4,Fall in Love with This,"I Fell in Love by Carlene Carter is a strong 4 star album; straddles the line between 4 and 5 but not quite there. One flaw is that a lot of the songs sound rather the same, at least the rhythm and music do. Here are some songs:I Fell in Love - this title track is very good, a rollicking rhythmCome on Back - very good energetic song, rocking rhythm with a strong drum beat. Great lyrics. Example: ""like a chain of heartaches, round your neck. Give em enough rope and they'll hang you yet.""My Dixie Darlin - has a flavor of traditional and bluegrassMe and the Wildwood Rose - a reminiscense back on making music as a child. A tribute to her music-making family.Overall a strong album"
1,The Doyle Estate must be broke to let this be published...,"Alan Vanneman's first Sherlock Holmes novel was a weak try at suspence and mystery. I was disappointed by his unrealistic view of what a Holmes mystery should be. But, that book could win awards compare to the trash that this one turned out to be. A seven year chase from here to there in Paris, Austria, Turkey and England with Watson and his adopted daughter in tow, never solving anything and bad mouthing Winston Churchill throughout the story. Watson spends more time in an intimate affair with a countess (a suspected murderess) than being the wise old companion that Holmes needs. Holmes puts Watson's daughter into danger every chance he get and those are too many. Keep your money or buy an Nero Wolf Novel instead."
1,"If you enjoy Doyle's Holmes, don't read this book.","If you are a fan of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes mysteries, do not waste your time with this book. The timeless characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are completely unrecognizeable and have been twisted to fit the modern idea of a mystery novel. The book also makes a vain attempt to fit these fictional characters into the real-world events of pre-WWI in a manner that leaves much to be desired. Do not waste your time with this book. I only gave this book one star because it won't allow you to assign zero."
2,Very disappointing,"Well, what can I say that hasn't already been written here. This is truly the bottom of the pastiche barrel.However, to say that Vanneman's effort ranks second only to Mitch Cullin's Slight Trick of the Mind as the WORST pastiche is an utterly laughable suggestion. Most Sherlockians, myself included, place Cullin's book rather high up on the list of excellent non-Doyle Sherlock novels (on par with A Study in Terror and Nick Meyer's Seven Percent Solution), especially in terms of the fine writing and Cullin's obvious knowledge and appreciation of the Canon.Vanneman, on the other hand, has displayed neither the writing skill nor scholarly detail required to make his second Holmes effort viable. Less informed readers, however, might find something to enjoy here, although I couldn't say what that would be."
1,A disappointment,"I have enjoyed many of the Sherlock Holmes spinoff novels, but I did not like this one. Quite frankly, I did not recognize the Dr. Watson whom I enjoyed in the Doyle stories. Here he is a rake who indulges in sexual romps with a countess. If that were in character for him, that would be fine, but he isn't really that way in Doyle. Sherlock Holmes is clever, but doesn't quite seem the cool reasoner whom we know in other incarnations, even by other authors."
1,Another book you can avoid reading,"This was one of the poorest pastiches it has been my misfortune to read. The story is disjointed and spread chronologically over too great a time span. Sadly, the author felt compelled to have Dr. Watson involved in a steamy love affair that really had no place in the story. Please don't waste money or time on this book."
2,"Bad, bad, bad.","A really bad attempt at a Sherlock Holmes story, as others have noted here. But it's not the worst. If you want the absolute WORST Sherlock Holmes book yet written, check out Mitch Cullin's A Slight Trick of the Mind."
3,STICKERS,"The book was perfectly fine. It even arrived on time. The issue was the giant sticker on the front cover that was nearly impossible to get off. Not to mention the same sized sticker on the inside front cover, as well as another one on the first page... Oh, and there was a slightly smaller sticker on the back cover as well.All these stickers were adverstising textbooksrus.com. My 'new' book was in great condition, aside from all the stickers that are now permanently stuck to it. In the item description it said this book 'may have some stickers on it.' Yeah.If you intend to buy this book for college and then sell it back, be forwarned. There are at least four stickers on it."
2,beware: compounded with WHEAT :(,"Please be aware that while this is a hard to find ingredient, and this might seem an affordable source, the ingredients are different on the actual container than on the website. Mine contained rice flour, gum arabic, asafoetida, tumeric and wheat flour.This is a real deal breaker for anyone with a wheat problem/ celiac!!I gave a low rating for the misinformation, and also that asafoetida is the third ingredient which is disappointing."
3,Not for the GF,This product is not 100% asafeotida--there is a binding agent(wheat)in there that I cannot eat due to allergy. I wish they would have shown the ingredients on the page.
3,"perhaps, not a valid review","I say that perhaps this isn't a valid review because in all honesty, I didn't eat any of it. I bought this product because I had read about some health benefits of Hing. However, when it arrived, I found the smell of it so offensive that I couldn't bring myself to add it to any foods. So I ended up tossing it away. I gave it 3 stars because I honestly don't know if it is excellent Hing or a not so good Hing. Sorry."
5,Good ole music,I so enjoyed receiving this album..... was in great shape and it brought back my Frosh year of college... thanks
4,Overlooked and underrated,"Despite only having two top 40 hits (Younger Girl & Mr. Dieingly Sad), the Critters were a talented (multiple lead singers, songwriters) band with a gift for melodic songs and pleasant harmonies. There isn't a bad track on this CD and several tracks could have given the Critters at least another top 40 hit if they'd survived the ravages of the draft and poor promotion. It may be out of print, but still shows up here and there and definitely worth picking up."
4,Good for a bunch of guys from Jersey suburbs.,"Excellent compilation of the Critters' Kapp recordings. Wish the original sequencing of the LP had been kept intact - I'd rather hear Don's smooth voice up front than Jimmy's whine. But it's great to have ""Bad Misunderstanding"","" Marryin' Kind of Love"" & ""Don't Let the Rain Fall Down On Me"" gathered together, along with a few obscurities & alternate mixes. Some of the songwriting is pretty weak & the band can't decide if they want to be the Lovin' Spoonful, The Byrds or the Beatles, but maybe that's part of their charm. I hope their later recordings for Enoch Light's Project 3 label are rereleased.Bob Rixon, WFMU"
5,"Sundazed Music, we need your help.","How careless of me to pass this excellent collection by! I do have the L.P., abreviated though it may be. Besides sporting overlooked gems such as ""Children and Flowers"", Gone For Awhile"" and ""Bad Misunderstanding"", this collection includes an excellent cover version of John Sebastian's ""Younger Girl"" and their seminal hit ""Mr. Dieingly Sad"". The latter has a lyric comperable to ""Cherish"" and an arrangement that touches the deepths of the soul. Here are two major staples of the mid-sixties shaping one of the finest moments of musical history. Regretably, this collection is no longer available, so I would like to personally commission the help of Sundazed Music or Hip-O Universal(Kapp was a subsidiary of MCA) in making this available once more."
5,How absolutely yummy!,"This is by far the best Indian cookery book I have ever come across. It is a pleasure to use - I am delighted by it. The recipes are easy to follow and only require easily found ingredients. Everytime I cook from it my husband says ""I feel like we've just eaten at a restaurant"" we are so impressed! There is plenty for the vegan too.Our favourites so far are the Whole Eggplant Curry (page 75), Hyderabadi Chili Curry (page 69) and the Pink Lentil Curry (page 112). There are so many wonders awaiting us - we haven't even tried any of the soups or apetizers yet.My only criticism is the lack of photographs - it is nice to see photographs for reassurance if nothing else!If you like delicious, authentic Indian food you'll love these recipes!"
4,Spicy!,"I bought this years ago and found it to be a good all-purpose intro to Indian cooking, though I have to admit, I pretty much stick to the vegetable, dal and rice recipes. Once you get the hang of at least those, it's easy to tweak and improvise and come up with similar style dishes with other ingredients.One thing to note: As an American, I found the dishes to be about twice too spicy. Following the recipes as is leaves most with a harsh, often too hot flavor, at least to my palate, and I enjoy all types of hot and spicy foods. If the spice amounts look overly large to your eye, or if you aren't positive you'll love extremely heavily spiced foods, start with half the stated amounts and follow your taste buds from there. Halving the spices always turns out just right for me."
4,Fair weather floor mats...,"I purchased these to replace the utterly destroyed factory mats. They are great for protecting your carpet from mud, grime, and to a degree melting snow. In fact, snow was the only thing that made a mess with these installed. It flows over the shortest edge near the door and allowed a grungy line to form in the carpet. Guess I should have expected that one. I can recommend these enthusiastically, as well as the back seat liners and the cargo area liner. If you are trying to keep a new vehicle looking new, or covering up some nasty old carpet these things are great. They clean off with a hose, and a bit of dressing makes them look new again but quite slippery. When I ordered they were a great price for a great item with fast shipping."
3,Routine Oldie,Not as good as some of the other old mystery movies. Guessed the bad guy half way through. Good for a rainy afternoon
4,Good dirty fun!,"The target audience for a record like this might be on the slim side, given the constant foul language and the irreverent Biblical jokes. For those who aren't upset by dirty words and hilarious pokes at ranting preachers, this record can be damned funny - although LaWanda seems to run out of steam halfway through the disc."
5,A Keeper!!,"This is a fantastic book. Lively characters, fast-paced plot, and plenty of conflict -- all the things a keeper book should have. I fully recommend this to anyone looking for a special romance."
4,Great fun..,I really liked this book. Sinclair falling out the window and into Jeff's arm was too funny. I would definatly recommnd this book to any western romance reader.
4,"good, but could be better","This is an excellent way to computerize a retail store. I wish there were a few more features available to basic. I'd like to be able to edit the bar code stickers, but that feature is only available when you spend more money. I don't need the other higher end features..so I'll just make due with what I've got."
1,BEWARE OF INTUIT QUICK BOOKS POS,"Long time user of Intuit Quick Books software but beware of them.When you ask for support they would connect you with a guy in India who besides stealing and American of a job don't know nothing and you will not understand a word of what he is saying.If you buy an older version, which are sufficient for any normal, small or regular business this company will reject you when you ask for support.Tip of the Iceberg Reason: They do not support older versions.Real Titanic Reason: They want to twist your arm in order that you buy the new ones which are more expensive and with lots of useless features.DO NOT BUY FROM INTUIT"
2,Not sharp enough,Not sharp enough for mine.Barely any hairs will trim off. You have to make alot more effort to thin them.
3,"A dramatic, embellished retelling of the Christmas story","play time: 23 min. Decent 3-D animation. Only the narrator and angels use the actual biblical text. The rest is the retelling of the Christmas story, the slaughter of the innocents (not scary) and flight into Egypt, with some (unobjectionable) dramatic embellishments. E.g. Mary has a feisty personality, tells of her relationship with her parents and with Joseph, sinister King Herod and entertaining Magi, the people hoping for the Savior to deliver them from Roman occupation. (I was very distracted by Mary's mother calling her husband Eli instead of Joachim...but I'm a nerd and sucker for tradition.) The more compelling story makes for a broader audience. Suggested age: 3-10 but adults would be somewhat more entertained with this story. Not any songs, just dramatic music throughout. Feels more like a cinema movie (Mary almost reminded me of a Disney heroine)."
2,prince of peace,This is not the original movie Prince of Peace seen in the early l950's. Please help me find it. It made a lasting impression on me as a young lad. It was about the life of Christ from birth to crucifixion. It was a great movie and should be shown again.
5,The Foundations Best Of CD Review,"Don't judge a group and/or artist who only had 2 hits or none for that matter. If you liked The Foundations 2 big hits, get this CD and explore their other material that never gets any airplay on the radio. I was lucky to find this CD last Sept. at a thrift shop and got to hear it for the first time this past Sun. evening. Must of played this 4 times in a row. Great stuff on it."
1,beware!,"I expected the same version of ""Build Me Up Buttercup"" that was on the Very Best of the Foundations album (i.e., the familiar radio version), but this download was a different version even though I got here via a link from the Very Best."
3,Okay deal,"Main complaint: runs exceptionally hot. More than once I've followed the cooking time in a slow cooker recipe and had it turn out extra-crispy around the edges. On the plus side, it has a keep warm setting, so you could probably use that instead of low and low instead of high and have things turn out right; or just scale back the cooking time as I usually do."
2,If its an ex library copy then say so in the description,"The book arrived in a fairly timely manner, but I was completely surprised that it is an ex library copy, as I have no way at all of telling how the seller came into possession of this book. It is not stamped ""discard"" or anything similar. I feel very uncomfortable buying from sellers who misrepresent such material facts about their product. The book itself looks very useful, but I will never do business with this seller again....omission is as bad as comission."
2,Elvis's Jewish Ancestry,I found this book to be done in a frivolous manner even though it certainly is based on facts. Elvis and his Jewish ancestry certainly deserve to be treated with more honor and respect than I found in this lighthearted book.
1,Disappointing,"I expected more from the author, as he has proven himself to be an excellent essayist on This American Life. Maybe I would have liked it more if I hadn't already heard some of his better material."
4,An eerie tone-mystery very much in the Vine style,"That Ruth Rendell writes a certain type of book -- very different from Rendell mysteries -- under the name and voice of another writer is astute. This is a dark, psychological mystery in the completely in the Vine style, dependent more on the twists of the mind (and there are some wonderfully twisted minds here) than on plot. Her books are particularly tasty in that they have no particular protagonist; I'm not sure who I was ""rooting for"" in this one. But Vine comes up with some unusual characters whose behavior is quite unpredictable. Not top of the Vine, but very satisfying"
1,Typical,"Incredibly tired of portrayals of ""bi-sexual"" men whose relationship with a homosexual men they are involved with are abusive and portrayed as demons in the flesh and suddenly a heterosexual woman walks into the picture and is represented as the shining light for all that is true passion and love, in spite of the fact that this woman knowingly sleeps with her brother's boyfriend. So many negative reinforced stereotypes and ""melotrauma"". The gay relationship was ""the traumatic experimentation"" and the woman, ""the cure"". Why all the vitriol???"
5,Very intriguing!,"I loved the book but did not have sympathy for any of the characters. The story was so tightly woven that just when you thought you had everything figured out, it changed. It was my first time reading anything by Barbara Vine. I'm hooked!!!"
4,Solid release,"I wanted to write a quick review on this one. The song again shows Stevie's ability to blend catchy and true lyrics, with modern Freestyle sounds. The Planet Hype mix is the highlight in this collection. Glenn Gutierrez delivers again, making Stevie really shine. The only downfall I think with this track is it is standard Planet Rock beat, which is not totally original."
2,Couldn't really see a difference,Screwed it on my camera. Turned the the filter while photographing water with sun glinting off it and couldn't see any difference no matter how I turned the filter (I turned it 360 degrees). Could be operator error and if it is I'm happy to change my review but I don't think it's worth anything to me. I've put polarized sunglasses in front of my point and shoot and gotten better results.
5,Great ideas for Christmas!,"I truly loved this book because of the variety of information presented. Decorating, gifts, and entertaining are covered, with great ""how-to"" instructions for the crafts presented. Although I am a faithful reader of Southern Living magazine, this was my first book in this series and it did not disappoint. I will definitely use this for years to come."
3,"Good, but very similar to other years. Good breakfast ideas","Very nice pictures and excellent decorating ideas for the home. The food part is very well done and gives complete menus for meals. I woudl recommmend this book, if you do have any of the other years."
2,Haynes diesel engine repair manual,"This manual only covers very basic, simple repair, mostly common sense stuff. Seems like every time I get to a section where I really need a manual, I run into the phrase ""this service is best left to a professional diesel mechanic"", instead of any constructive information."
1,Haynes Diesel Repair Manual Review,"While this manual says that it covers both GM and Ford Diesel Engines, it's readily apparent within the first few pages that this book is written mostly for the GM guys. I bought this book in hopes finding good usable repair information for my '92 F350 7.3 IDI and found it extremely lacking. Sure it has information on tear-down and re-build, however, basic maintenance, repair, and trouble shooting was minimal, at best, for the early IDI Ford Diesels.Haynes Manuals have been notoriously lacking on content for years (I should have known better), so don't be surprised for frustrated if you can't find the detaild information you're looking for."
4,In a Nutshell,"Great reference for the warehouse manager or project manger. Provides an excellent explanation of the various warehouse activities and equipment. Very useful for project management with good walk-throughs for many warehouse / distribution projects; especially racking, WMS and RF. Also is a good reference for project management in general; provides many examples of project documentation and checklists. Detailed yet information is easy to find. I hope future editions take a closer look at scalability and tecnology that integrates the WMS with the Enterprise system. Overall a great resource for any Ops department..."
5,Richard Dreyfuss at his usual best,"This film is about 24 hours in the life of a fallen Hollywood producer who was on top in the silent film era, and due to the ""talkies"" is now living in his deteriorated mansion drinking four bottles of wine a day and making porn films for a living. Veronica Cartwright is the catalyst of transformation in the film, but this is an unconventional plot, not trite, and can be ambiguous. The acting and script is dynamic, and quite an emotional range, involving the viewer they way any brilliant, overlooked film can."
4,Steve's Early Years 1959-1960,"Songs on this CD were recorded from 1959 to 1960 (according to the CD insert). Steve seems to have been at a transition period here. About four of the songs are in the pop rock category, like ""Pretty Blue Eyes"" and ""Footsteps"". The other songs are more like your mom and dad would listen to. Steve eventually sang more for the adult crowd when he teamed up with Eydie Gorme. Sound quality is excellent. All songs are in true stereo. The following statement is contained in the CD insert: ""This compilation was made from the best original stereo 2-track master tapes available at MCA Records. Documentation shows that the multi-track session tapes were destroyed in the 1970's"". Final note: noticeably missing on this CD (in my opinion) is ""Poor Little Rich Girl"", a great pop rock song from this same time frame."
2,Best of Steve Lawrence,Where is his hit song..Go Away Little Girl...of all the songs he has recorded..this is the one that should have been included in one of his albums...
1,Short on hits,"Thankfully I now have found a best of that truly has all of his and Eydie's hits on it, all on one disc. This Taragon disc has no value for the money."
2,"Too much muzak, and not enough good music...","The problem with this is Steve Lawrence's hits are his worst songs, his hits are very forgetteable, however it is the standards with jazz big band arrangements or lush string arrangements that sound the best with Lawrences style. The stinkeroos on this CD are ""Pretty Brown Eyes"" ""Loving Is A Way Of Living"" and others in the just plain bad supersquare Andy Williams/Johnny Mathis muzak style. If you compare those tacky hits with the standards like ""I Hear A Rhapsody"" ""There'll be Some Changes Made"" ""Somebody Else Is Taking My Place"" you will hear a hip singer more influenced by Frank Sinatra. This CD has it's good and bad moments."
2,Not worth the price,"There are a few problems with this alarm clock that make it not worth the money. First, it is very lightweight and incredibly easy to knock over when you reach over to turn off the alarm in the morning. It has a button to light the background so you can read the time, but when you try to read it, the numbers disappear. The snooze function only gives you 4 minutes, without the ability to change the setting. I think this would be fine as a temporary fix or for travelling, but only if the price was a lot lower."
5,So insightful,"I was introduced to dr Wayne dyer through a video of his called ""The Shift"". He is so insightful. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for more direction and purpose to their life. Awesome book!"
3,a bit disappointed,"I bought this for a friend, however, there was no mention that the previous owner had written his name in the front of the book and had highlighted passages in the book. Rather disappointing."
4,The power of intention,"Wayne Dyer is very interesting to listen to. You already know this stuff, but he motivates you to change your negative thinking. I have shared it with most of my family and even the most cynical have enjoyed the premise."
5,Wayne's Best Book!,"I have read five Wayne Dyer books, and this one hasset a new standard for clearly liberating writing.Gone is the Wayne telling you things, and in itsplace is a wonderful, accepting, empowering spiritthat is enlightening and down-to-earth at the sametime. I have given this book away four times, andsince I am down to one copy, it's time to buy somemore! (ps-Since Wayne's journey is not over, I can'treally say BEST, but rather: BEST YET!!) Readingthis book is a continuous joy."
1,"Same old, same old","A repetition of virtually every other ""think and it shall come to you"" book on the market, and not very well done. The author has an unfortunate stream-of-consciousness approach to writing this book. Instead of taking things a step at a time, he jumps around like a monkey in the trees. Don't bother buying - check it out from the library."
5,Excellent book,"This book has had a great/positive impact in my life. When reading the book, please apply common sense. I have sent this books to several people I have never met in person, but spoke to on the phone."
5,Fabulous Writer & Book,I cannot ever say enough about Dr. Dyer's work. There's not a boring page in the book. I read something in every single chapter that I needed to learn.
5,The Power of Intention-By Wayne W. Dyer,"I came accross this CD via a friend. Soon after another friend was talking about the same CD. Very interested in what they have learned, I purchaed it for myself. Needless to say after listening to it more than a few times, I haven't been able to stop thinking of some amazing points that Wayne Dyer makes. He is simple yet deeply rooted, soft yet bold. I have been able to apply much of what he talks about in ways that are already benefiting my life, I find myself letting go of silly hang-ups and getting closer to what I am really here to do! The Power of Intenetion is a wonderful life tool."
4,The Poweer of Intention,"As usual, I have enjoyed Wayne Dyer's enthusiastic wisdom. He really wants his readers to secceed, to heal,to prosper and thrive and he does his best to give us ways to best practice. I find his book generous and genuine and would recommend it to all!"
5,amazing..,"This book truly changed my life. I started reading it when I was going through a very hard time in my life, where I just wanted to give up on everything. Dr. Dyer has really made me come to appreciate everything in my life, even the little things, immensely. I suggest this book to anyone who is trying to find their divine purpose, or to anyone who is just going through a funk. The words within these pages are incredibly inspiring."
3,even though i have not read this book..............,"But, i agree that if you think the positive way with respect to others, you will get what you've desire, i'm a buddhist, and for all these years, i pratice,inside my soul and learn and gain a lot of things that i ask to be given.......But, believe or not, if you asking something that you want, you have to think of GIVE too, this universe will received your message and arrange it. For instant, you try to plant a watermelon seed, with all the watering and time, you'll have water melon tree, it will not turn into a tomato, ""what"" you plant is ""what"" you get, and apply this thinking to your mind and start asking from your heart what you need, start of how toGIVE them back if you received what you want, then you will start to receive what you asked for, if you do not believe it, just pratice them, you'll be amazed of this theory...."
4,Interesting read,"Nice read, deliberately vague at the beginning, need to read on to understand his meaning. interesting premise, good read, but could be more engaging."
1,Sound and fury,"Fortunately, I've known one of Wayne Dyer's wives (out of 4?), who he treated as a posession --- no leaving the hotel while he's working, no socializing without him, no learning to drive, and other emotional abuse.Just wanted you'all to know what a phoney he is.If someone gets some help out of his messages, it's in spite of him. Kindness is great, but know that you can be kind/generous/peaceful/etc without Wayne's inspiration --- aka guru complex. I think hi$ Hawaii e$tate $um$ it up -- it's a great gig if you can get it.Skip Wayne, and go straight for the Dalai Lama, Geri Larkin's 'Stumbling Toward Enlightenment', or any of the 'regular folks' who make a more honest living."
2,Out with God and in with the force.,"""Caveat-Emptor"" or Buyer Beware!! There is both good and bad in Dr. Dyer's book. First, if you have a solid faith in Judeo-Christianity then you'll find this book a wealth of information that explains the laws God gave us to be healthy and prosperous. By knowing God is a supreme being and not a force, like electricity, then one can benefit immensely by applying these timeless concepts back into the framework that God is supreme and we are His children. Be cautious and know that Dr. Dyer stripped these concepts from their source. One must understand the context that these universal principles were meant for. Jesus said it best when he explained that we are the branches, Jesus is the vine, and God is the vine dresser. In this context we can become one with God, but not be god. When we are connected to God he will feed us. In this framework we are to do God's will and not ours. Otherwise, this book is just another positive thinking book."
1,Pentecostalism run amuck,"If you are really into the church scene and believe you'll be blessed once you become 'good enough' then this is the book for you. If you feel and have been taught that you are not blessed because you just didn't 'do it right' then this is the book for you.The book is beautiful as far as the cover and pictures and layout. But, it's so churchy it really turned me off. After reading many books on ""your imagination creates reality"" I have to say this is, by far, the worst one I have ever read. To me it was not inspiring at all, it was just constant drivel about doing the right thing and you'll have all your dreams come true. It took me several days to get half way through the book and I doubt I can force myself to read the rest of it.This book is just old church crap formed into new words. It's also very boring."
1,Don't even bother to glance at this piece of crap!,"When I read the title of this book, ""The Power of Intention"", I assumed a psychological self-help book with some anecdotes and tips.After reading a few sentences, I was confused because I thought I was reading a book about Christianity.The author has this vague intention to preach how mighty the god is and he is the one who can make us happy and peaceful.Author's writing is so contrived, artificially shallow and wannabe-abstract; I couldn't even summarize what the author wrote about.Give me a break!"
5,Dr. Dyer's Best Work to Date,"This book is a one of a kind masterpiece. Dr. Dyer hits it right on the head and sums up what many other authors and speakers try to convey. Change your thoughts, it's that simple. I firmly believe in the Power of Intention and have actually witnessed this power in my daily life. If you could only read one book, make it this one, you won't regret it!"
1,banal and old-guy lecturing,"I agree with a lot of readers this is some wanna-manifest-$ guy rewording other people's great thoughts. I have another work by Dyer and have never cared for his old-white-guy-type lecturing ""what you need to do..."". I also bought a book for which he had written a snippet review for ('end of the universe...'? by Renard) where he predicted it would be one of most spiritually revolutionary books...blah blah blah. But it's not true - in the least - and I would be surprised if Dyer even read the book. I feel instead he participates in that ugly Hay House nepotistic-marketing where they force their authors to promote all Hay House authors regardless of quality. There's so much good work out there that is engaging and not so lecturing - get those!"
1,I found it metaphysical.,"Based on the good reviews I read about this book, I thought that it worth to be read, however I has a difficult time to understand what he means, it has nothing to do with other self-improvement books like the seven habits by Stephen Covey, Life Strategies by Phillip C. McGraw, or Optimal Thinking by Rosalene Glickman.Anyway Mr Wayne Dyer has disillusioned me after reading one of his books for the first time."
1,A load of Crap...lifted from 'the secret' or Fritzlof Capra...in the 1970's,"Need I say more? This information is not new. It is lifted from that other book ""the secret' Imho both are a load of crap.Study quantum physics. Do the math. The suffering in the world is not due to improper manifestaions of innate capabilities to manifest material well being.what a load of crap. He is an old wind bag and most of his books and seminars are 'lifted' and synthesized from topical urban myths....give me a break. this stuff sells? I am thinking of the p.t. barnum famous phrases...."
2,"So, SO","It has some good sound bites to keep in mind. But, the reviewers below have a point when they say that Dr. Dyer has borrowed much from other sources. I would wait until this book comes out in paperback before buying - if at all. Another note for those who have read this book - I have an intent for 100 million dollars and a Learjet 45 for the last 10 years. It hasn't come yet! Then again, if I had a book with MY FACE ON IT, then maybe I COULD GET SPECIAL TREATMENT FROM AN AIRLINE! It has NOTHING to do with THE POWER OF INTENT, it's celebrity worship! Thank you very little Dr. Dyer!!!!"
1,Needed Better Gounding,"I like Dr. Phil's common sense advice, and that is why I'm surprised Dr. Dyer says negative things. Like this book, his criticism is hard to pin down. Perhaps overcoming obstacles is something Dr. Dyer doesn't like to discuss in concrete terms.In the Sonoma press, Dr. Dyer talked about his addictions, including cocaine which affected his current marriage (his first ended in divorce. His challenges with alchohol and drugs and specifically how he coped would have given this book some grounding.This book has abstract Emersonion philosophy. Frankly, Dr. Phil is more practical and fun to read.Overall, Dyer's message is a positive one. If he could only write directly to the point, this book would have merited more stars."
2,co-creating your world,"I loved watching Wayne Dyer on PBS, so I purchased this CD set. Unfortunately, the material was a repeat of his tv special. I thought there would be a little more meat to it. I was disappointed and I'm suffering from buyers remorse!"
5,Best Yet,"When they say ""the best is yet to come"" I must say it has arrived in Wayne Dyer's new book The Power of Intention. If everyone read this book and took it to heart, it would be a beautiful world. I want to comment on a couple of reviews. Two or three people commented on the alleged cocaine addiction of Wayne Dyer. Those comments reek of stupidity. How can anyone cast aspersions unless they sat right down next to Dr. Dyer and snorted with him. Obviously, the people who made those comments received NOTHING from his book. But, they are not afraid to sit in judgment."
3,Abstract and over-simplified,"the word source is quite abstract... it could be another word that is more concrete. don't say ""turn the illumination on"" when you can say ""turn the light on"".also, this description of the ""perfect world"" is over-simplified without much justification."
2,Yes I agree- Mediocre like Dyer Himself,"I think peter07 said it perfectly with ""Mediocre, Like Dyer Himself"". I'm reading this book right now and I've seen this guy on TV and I'm quite unimpressed. I love to be enlightened by hearing highly educated enlightened people like Allan Watts, possibly Ekhart Tolle and others speak. But to me this guy is a poser, a charlitan who learned a the elementary phases of some spiritual/practical concepts and is trying to capitalize on it by pretending to really know what he's talking about. He's a rather poor writer as well."
5,Dyer,Wayne Dyers books have been a mainstay for me all these years. His books help one to clarify fuzzy thinkin and make positive changes. Along with Deepak Chopra and Esther Hicks and of course The One Command by Asara Lovejoy.
3,Dr. Dyer is close... but David Icke is closer...,"If you want to get even closer, read David Icke's ""tales from the time loop"" and Tolle's ""the power of NOW.""Icke's book will change your life as will Tolle's if given the chance...Dyer is a very close but the two books above will take you further..."
3,It's a COURSE IN MIRACLES !,"Basically this is straight from A COURSE IN MIRACLES. I just watched the PBS special, and am pretty amazed that he makes such negative references to Dr. Phil. If he's without judgement and so ""connected"" - seems like he's needing a little more connection. Not that he doesn't have great things to say. However, I've never seen the products and the pledges so HIGH. Must be trying to support that cocaine habit."
3,"Read Dyer's ""Sources"" First","This theory and associated book are just restatements of many a great thinker from the past. Dyer says early on that he picked up this philosophy from Castaneda, or at least the concept of ""intention"". Read the early Castaneda books, then check out Napolean Hill's classic, ""Think and Grow Rich"" published in the 1920's. In short, this book is nothing new, doesn't provide a framework for implementing this philosophy, and the concepts can be better learnt at your local library."
5,A Work of Art ... full of Powerful Insights!,"Typical of Wayne Dyer - his new book on Intention is both elegant and eloquent - yet practical and easy to apply. It is the ultimate ""owner's manual"" on how to be a co-creator with the field of Intention. Solomon once said that there's nothing new under the sun - and it would be easy to think that all this has been said before. Maybe, in some ways, that's true. But it's never been said this way, or in this context, or presented in such a beautiful package. I am a long-time fan of all things written or produced by Wayne Dyer and might have missed this one - thinking my bookshelves are already filled with his writings. I'm so happy that I trusted my intuition! I will be gifting this to family and friends for a long time to come. I love this book. Thank you, Wayne Dyer!"
5,Power of Intention,"This was a great tape. Very positive, I could listen to him everyday. This is the 3rd Wayne Dr. book I have had and I have found them all useful."
5,"Open your mind, read this book, and prepare to be lifted","Dr. Dyer is a man possessed with the mission of lifting humanity to it's highest potential, one person at a time.This book helped me get a grip on my spiritual path.The fundamental premiss of the book is that you are connected to all thing. The book helps you understand and embrace that connection.Must read."
4,Dr. Wayne Dwyer Power of Intention,I can highly recommend this to anyone has wondered why do these things happen to me. This is the type of book that will get you thinking and get the juices flowing and help you turn you mind back on.
5,Inspiring and Uplifting Piece of Motivation,"I pride myself on consistently working to improve myself mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually. Having said that I read this book and proclaim it to be the MOST INSPIRATIONAL, UPLIFTING AND MOTIVATIONAL piece of literature I have ever read. I purchased a copy for a friend because there is no greater gift than the one I received from reading this book."
5,The ball is in play....,"This book is fantastic. It is insightful and instructive. Although the book is inherently complex and profound, its advice is kept simple. Wayne includes lists of things to be aware of and directions/decisions you can make for the better. He offers a framework or point of view from which to proceed which can be used by everyone no matter which level of trueth one currently operates at.Book Review Done, Advice Below:If you want to change your life...you can begin simply and immediately by surrendering yourself to god/the absolute/universe/whole....whatever....meditate and radiate/offer from your heart peace, harmony, laughter and love (thank you Deepak Chopra). Do it slowly, quietly, annonomously and purposefully....and oh my god! I guarenteeeeee, it will change your life and is a great companion to Wayne's book.Best wishes...."
5,Wayne Dyer's best book yet!,"If you are a fan of Wayne Dyer and his powerful message of love and transformation, you will want to read this book! If you are new to Dyer's work, this is where to start, as this book contains nuggets of all of his best work to date, and actually transcends where he had gone before. I finished the book this morning, and I plan to read it again, as it is so full of tips to change your life for the better, as well as beautiful spiritual messages, affirmations and stories, all woven together to support one another, and to support the reader's understanding. You will feel blessed to read to these words!"
3,"A good read, albiet a bit long winded.","I respect Wayne Dyer, he has done amazing good in his lifetime. This will be the first book I have read of his and found it a bit average in general. Manifestation of intent is am amazing gift to humanity, but this book merely scratches the service of it, doesn't get into the mechanics of the law surrounding it, and is a bit too preachy and feel goody for me.I already understood the Law of Attraction, and wanted more mechanics and brass tacks of the operating principles of it, and I didn't find that in this book. You'll find that in Seth or Hicks books instead. What I found in this book was overall a fairly inspiration read that I would rate for beginning spiritual seekers only. Anyone already in the advanced vibration won't find much of anything new here.Recommended with reservation for beginner spiritual seekers or those very new to manifesting intent."
5,"I loved it so much, I ran out and bought the book!","I consider personal development a hobby. I have done EST, Landmark Education courses; been to countless John Bradshaw seminars, Caroline Myss seminars, studied Tai Chi, meditation, . . the list goes on. That said, I found ""The Power of Intention"" to be advanced in its' ability to convey an impactful experience on the audience(me). Now I get that, ""it's all subjective"", but I cannot recommend this disc series enough. It doesn't just offer words, it offers transforming the way you view yourself and the world. None of the info is ""necessarily"" new but it is put together in a way that had a powerful impact on me. ON THE OTHER HAND, it could just be what I needed to hear right now."
2,Did not give credit to source of information,"I have read all of Wayne Dyer's books and I have seen him speak in person. His message is always inspirational and I've enjoyed seeing the evolution of his work over the years. I would give this book 5 stars except that the material in Chapter 11 is taken from someone else's work and no credit is given for it. I'm disappointed that Dr. Dyer did not acknowledge the copyrighted work of Jerry and Esther Hicks which makes me wonder if he has borrowed from others without credit as well. While his message is good, it would have been more powerful had he fully acknowledged the source of all of his material instead of pretending these are all his own thoughts and words."
5,Excellent book,"I found Dr. Dyer's book very well-written and something I can apply to my own life. I was struggling with many facets of my life when I saw Dr. Dyer's PBS special. I was so taken with it that I went out and bought his book. This was the first book of his I have read. I found his style of writing very easy, and something I could follow. The book has helped boost my confidence in my own abilities. I definitely recommend it. Thank you so much Dr. Dyer!"
1,More like The Power of Deception,"Dyer talks about supressing ego and yet his blankets this book. I bought the ""whole enchalada"" via PBS fund raiser. Thank God for tax deductitions. What turned me off the most was his treatment of the poor. It is as if because they haven't ""connected to"" the ""source"" they were responsible for their own situation. I wish he would go to the Sudan, or maybe the 150,000 lives lost in Asia is because they couldn't manifest themselves from disaster. This book is so bad.It has no scientific or spiritual basis to it. It is Dyer's way of manifesting his own wealth. Do not waste your time or $."
3,Dr.Dyer Repeats Himself Again,"Although I enjoyed listening to The Power Of Intention it is basically the same philosophy that Dr.Dyer has sold his followers for the past 20 years.What I dont get is how Dyer and other new-age gurus express that emotions such as jealousy and anger are ""low energy"" emotions when Christ and other spiritual leaders they quote from poseesed these energies also as documented in the Bible,etc.etc."
4,More Power To You!,"Whether you call it Intention, Desire, or even Prayer, we all have a remarkable power to manifest whatever it is we want to have, do, or be in life. The trick is learning how to align ourselves with the Source of Manifestation itself. And in this book, Dr. Dyer shows us how to do exactly that. Thank you, Dr. Dyer, for helping us understand more about this remarkably responsive universe we live in!Steven Lane Taylor, author of Row, Row, Row Your Boat: A Guide for Living Life in the Divine Flow"
1,Power of Intention,This book has made a huge impact on my life. I view my life and its purpose from a completely new perspective. Amazingly his basic premise was echoed at a retreat that my wife attended recently. We are Catholic and it just all fits- the retreat focused on teaching of Fr Thomas Merton. Enjoy the book- I could not put it down.
4,Connecting with Dyer,"Wayne Dyer's ability to connect with his audience-whether they are at one of his seminars or sitting at home reading his books-is fascinating. He has always had the ability to make complex concepts seem simple. If you like Wayne Dyer, this book will not disappoint. James Green,, author of ""If There's One Thing I've Learned."""
1,sloppy,"The author spends a lot of time talking about himself. The philosophy in it has deep flaws that can border on victim blaming. Positive thoughts go a long way, but much of the philosophy in the book is not well thought out, and omits important qualifiers. For example, tell a child in an abusive home that her destiny is mainly determined by her spiritual thoughts? She brought this on herself? I think not.The book has not really thought through many sides of the issues it presents. Victims, those with disabilities, those who are dependent on others -and how all of that would be related to karma and intention, is all omitted. In terms of being a term paper in philosophy it is very poor. Other thinkers and texts are mentioned rarely and fleetingly. Most of it is invented, de novo, from a comfortable position."
5,Isaiah 54:17 - Powerful!,"When I saw the title of this book, I knew I had to read it. This is the scripture that has saved me throughout my walk with Christ. This is an excellent book. You will cry, laugh, and feel the pain and spirit of the Blackmans as they live. Rebecca Nails-Pierce is an excellent storyteller. Read this book and you won't be disappointed. You will be reminded of someone with every character in this books. They are real. I especially related to Zaria, the woman minister. God Bless you, Rebecca and I look forward to your next book."
4,Bravo!,"This is an excellent way to reach the lost. Jesus said he came to seek those that are lost. If you are in good health, then you don't need a physician. But if you are sick, then you do. Jesus came to heal the sick (especially the sin sick soul). Using profanity, sexual language is the way of the lost. You have to be wise to win them over. Beating them with scriptures will not conquer. There's a huge difference between writing profanity and speaking it. I believe the author of Beyond Jordan owes Ms. Pierce an apology. A Saint understands how to reach the lost and how to comfort other Saints, but a Christian has yet to learn and never coming into the knowledge of the truth. Hats off to ""NWFAM."""
3,"Great for the Novelty, But..","Bought this as a gift for my comic-loving boyfriend. He loves it for the novelty, but it doesn't smell that great."
3,The Discs Are Defective,"If you are planning on purchasing this dvd, be warned-the audio on the interview segment is defective, to the point where at least half the interview is silent. I know the audio for this interview exists, because I have an old vhs copy with most of this interview on it, so it must have just been carelessness on the part of Flipside, or whoever made this dvd. As far as I know, all the discs have this same defect, and I don't think Flipside has done anything to fix it. The music footage is very good, however."
3,"Nice size, sturdy, portable, but opening too small for a hand","I recommend this with reservations.PRO:- Nice size. Holds about 1 cup of salt.- Matches other Le Creuset items you may have. Elegant appearance.- Easy to carry around given the knob on top.CON:- Glazed interior...some people may find the salt clumps. Many salt pigs have an unglazed interior for this reason.- The opening is too small to allow a medium or large hand to reach in and grab salt easily. A med- or large hand could pinch up some salt, but if you intend to use your hand to get salt, and you have medium to large hands, I would get a salt pig with a larger opening such as the Emile Henry. If you plan to always use a spoon this would not be a problem."
1,Poor design!,I was extremely disappointed in the design of this product. I love my cookwear and wanted a salt crock to go along with it. Very inconvient to use. Adult fingers do not fit into it. Salt winds up all over my counter! UGH! I went back to my old one even though it has a cover I have to remove every time I use it. Waste of money!!!!!
4,"Nice, but shallow","Love the color and the wide mouth. Only drawback is that the opening is rather low. We are not salt-aholics, but we do enough cooking at home that we like to have ingredients near the cooking area. Because of this, we need a deeper salt pig.Still, 4 stars as it may be perfect for others."
1,MP3 version is k-tel re-recordings,"The MP3 version is k-tel. They are all re-recordings. Amazon has attached them to the wrong CD. The MP3 tracks are not the same as the CD. Buy the CD with the picture of the band on the cover, if you can find it, and not the k-tel version with the cheesy 3-d lettering on the cover."
3,The Best of the Fortunes,"One thing I've learned about assessing ""oldies"" is that there are several versions of songs thought to be the ""orginal song by original artist."" The collection under review is done well, but I'm not quite as convinced as my fellow critics that these are the same as the versions that aired on U.S. radio / Top 40 during the era(s) of their popularity. I pulled up the 45 rpm versions from the closet to compare and was struck by some clear differences in ""You've Got Your Troubles"" as it is found in this compilation and that found on ""British Invasion Gold,"" which is seemingly identical to the 45 rpm version on Press Records. ""Here Comes that Rainy Day Feeling"" is, again, done well, but seems at variance a bit from the Capitol version on 45 rpm. I can't speak to the remainder of the songs as I have less familiarity with these."
3,Lasted a little over a year--company honored warranty,This door lasted for about 18 months when my chihuahua charged through it one time too many and the door broke. The product has a three year warranty so I contacted the manufacturer and they sent me a replacement door.
2,Door broke and I can't find a replacement,"Our cat broke the hinge part of the plastic flap going through the door. I super glued it, but a week later she broke it again. Small cat, small door, small pain in the rear now that I've cut a whole through my solid core entry door."
3,cat - door....,"Works great, the cats love it and so do we, no more waking up in the middle of the night to let them in lolI would most likely buy from this seller again if needed."
5,Fab music...,"I love this cd...great songs...great writing. Buy it! Unfortunately, Parsons died way too young. What a loss. He had a lot more to give."
5,awesome,this cd was awesome it came in a day earlier than expected so it was a surprise for me when I got the mail that day stuck it in my truck cd player and has been their eversense cool cd.
4,"Be Honest, Is Country Rock For Real Men?","On this 2 albums on 1 CD, the answer is yes.GP was released in January 1973 and Grievous Angel in January 1974.Taken together that's 75 minutes of early country rock, although Gram had more or less started the genre with his strong influence on The Byrds 1968 Sweetheart Of The Rodeo.For these recordings Gram enlisted some heavyweight musicans including Rich Grech, James Burton, Buddy Emmons, Byron Berline, Glen D. Hardin and also put Emmylou Harris into the spotlight for the first time.The songs alternate from medium to slower paced, my prefernces are for The New Soft Shoe, Hickory Wind and Love Hurts.Gram did not live a long life, but his music certainly passes the test of time."
4,Breakthrough Stuff,"Parsons music built the bridge between classic country and rock. Before Parsons the links had either been with the old folk/hootenany crowd, English guys learning from real blues men, or rockabilly. Parsons was the first to firmly plant a country flag on rock's territory.The results aren't perfect. Parson's singing is uneven (thank god for EmmyLou) and not every song is a standout. But taken as a whole it's hard not to appreciate what he did. Bands like the Eagles and too many singers to name would have lost their way if it weren't for Parsons showing them the path. Kris Kristofferson is the only other real trailblazer of note.Interestingly, while Parsons was building links to mainstream country, Willie and Waylon were teaming up to form a new country sound that was accessible to the rock world.Too bad tragedy struck. Imagine an album with Gram, Willie, and Waylon."
4,Sweet Value,"You can't go wrong with this package: two complete Gram Parsons albums on one CD. I only knew Gram from his association with Keith Richards, and bought this on the strength of the tune ""In My Hour of Darkness"". The tracks here do not disappoint, with great harmonies and songwriting, backed by talented musicians. It made me want to discover more about the man & his music. It's a lot more old-school country than rock, to my ears. My CD came in a thin postal wrapper offering no protection, so the jewel case was completely broken. I did return it and was promptly sent another (in the same type of wrapper). This time, the CD case was merely cracked and I decided to live with it. The CD itself plays fine."
4,A Country Romantic,"The first time I listened to this CD (or more accurately, these 2 albums) I was not too enthusiastic--mostly because I had been hearing the name Gram Parsons permanently linked with ""country rock."" Well, as other reviewers have pointed out, not much rock in here. But the misnomer is not Parsons fault, and I really don't care too much for such labels anyway. Upon further listening, I found myself thoroughly enchanted. Yep, the blue-eyed soulfulness is apparent, even among the twangier tunes. And I can't argue with the notion that Parsons, clearly a romantic for country music, conveys a distinctively ""rock 'n' roll"" attitude throughout. All of it blends together magnificently. And the kicker, for me at least, is the presence of guitar legend James Burton--his contributions alone make the CD worthwhile."
5,the consumation of traditional country & modern times,"What a masterpiece! From the moment Gram's nicotine enriched tenor plead's with Annie Rich to scratch his itch, I was hooked. A few lines later, Emmylou adds gorgeous harmony and the spell is cast. Not a speck of cereal, folks. This disc should send the listener to honky-tonk heaven, and on the way, Gram points to the pioneers of true cosmic country, Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Jack Clement, Buck Owens, Charlie & Ira Louvin, The Everly Brothers, Rose Maddox, Jimmy Martin, et al..New Sofshu indeed.................."
3,talent..raw,"I just received this cd yesterday. I was so interested in it...as i am a real fan of Emmylou,and am aware of her relationship with Gram.It is fascinating, as it just brings to light how very talented both were, and how raw the talent.On this CD, they just ""belt it out"" for the most part, without the cadence and nuances that Emmylou now has.The cut of green silk and silver slippers by Gram is emotional, an d does show he would have grown into his/their music.It is a pity Gram was so haunted, as to die from the usual artist way: OD.Emmylou, on her Heartaches and Highways breaks your heart as you listen to her: ""Boulder to Birmingham"". She is mature ( actually a high priestess of here genre now), and that song is her love for Gram.One can only imagine if he had not away with himself.....they would have become fine-tuned, and wondrous."
3,I listen to this once in a while,"The music on this isn't realy my kind of country, but still worth having in your country collection"
5,Classic,"The version of ""Hickory Wind"" here makes the version from the Byrds' ""Sweetheart of the Rodeo"" sound stiff and wooden, and is in and of itself worth the price of admission. There is more to savor here: Rollicking versions of ""I Can't Dance"" and ""Cash on the Barrelhead"", and the almost painfully tender songs ""The Return of the Grevious Angel"" and ""In My Hour of Darkness"". Parsons didn't exactly turn his back on the rock music he made in younger days, but grew out of it into a purer, stronger country and western sound."
4,"So far so good, but flammable?","Very comfortable topper for our extra firm bed, but the package came with a warning that memory foam is highly flammable. I don't smoke; Nor I plan on lighting fires in bed, but wish I had known this before."
4,Good Key Box,I failed to note the measurements and could have used one a bit bigger but it is serving its purpose!
3,It's ok,Pro:Filters airCon:Doesn't fit in the unit as well as OEM filters or other 3rd party filters that I've used in the past.
2,Inaccurate,"I bought this product last month and after comparing with fluke, the reading are off by as much as 5 volts on 120 volt ac. The temperature is also off by at least 4 degrees. Not recommended."
4,Innovatively Fresh,A great CD with a sound that reminds me of the Beatles in their later years; great harmonies and innovative style. An older sound that has been modernized for these newer times. It is refreshing to hear a band that isn't trying to sound like every other band that is currently trying to make a name for themselves.
4,Decent Album,"I'm not much on buying CDs without knowing the artist first. I had heard thier one song on Run Fat Boy Run, but other than that the band was unknown to me. I must say I was impressed. The songs are catchy and have more of an up-beat swing to them. This is definately worth the money."
5,The best debut album since Definitely Maybe by Oasis!,"I am a huge fan of the British music scene. I'm a die hard Oasis fan and also i'm a huge Kasabian fan. I love british music. I was reading in an article in NME magazine and it said that this new band The Fratellis debut album Costello Music could be one of the biggest albums ever. When I read this I literally laughed and said no way!After listening to this album I was so wrong! This album is pure genious! Every song from top to bottom is amazing. I can't tell you how many times I have listened to this album, because frankly I've lost count! This album is so amazing I couldn't believe how good every song was when I listened to it.All the lyrics and music is so catchy and the band just has the attitude that it takes! If your a fan of the British music scene like myself do your self a favor and pick up this album! IT WILL BLOW YOUR MIND!"
5,YEAH!,"This a great CD!!! Definitely way above a one-note band. Multi-layered songs with great vocals that work with the music. To be honest, I don't really understand the lyrics BUT I really don't care as the music is sooo good."
3,a little wild,"I like several songs on this CD--some are a bit ""wild"" or ""overdone"" for my taste. It took over a year since I first heard ""Whistle For the Choir"" before I was able to find it."
1,DRIVEL,"You people are all nuts... I am selling this to SPUN if they'll even have it. This band takes a good song base and destroys it everytime with either a la,la la la or a change that just doesn't go anywhere. I don't doubt they can play their instruments, I just think that perhaps they should change places and try again."
5,A Great New Band,"This truly is an outstanding debut album. The writing is first rate; the best pop tunes are always hook-laden and fun and that's what is here. This is the most refreshing and exciting pop album in a very long time, in fact. If you like the energy of the early Beatles and the catchiness they had, this is for you. Every song is a lively, exciting pop confection. The band sounds like a cross between the Beatles, the Kinks and the Who and I say this as one who grew up with these bands. Bravo!"
4,"fun, refreshing music","Since discovering the Fratellis, I have been trying to get all my friends to listen. Theirs is a new, fun, exciting, and catchy sound and I want to share the musical joy with everyone.More than anything else, the songs are catchy; try not to sing or at least hum along with 'For the Girl' or tap your foot to 'Henrietta' or 'Creeping up the Backstairs'. I bet you can't do it.There is a lot of crappy catchy music out there (My Humps, Sexyback, anything they play on the radio nowadays) but the Fratellis are actually good. You should buy their CD. Or if you know me and live nearby, I could put it on a flash drive for you. Whatever.Kudos to you, Fratellis for being awesome. I await the release of your next album."
3,Costello Music,"Costello Music is a great example of catchy, get up and sing guitar music. Choruses are meant to be sung en mass; verses are brief and don't get in the way of the choruses. It's fast, it's effective, it gets the job done. Think of it as a musical pick-me-up. It fades as it goes, and I think the later songs could have done with turning down the guitar a few notches, but it's a good album. Not great, but good. The best moment, it should be noted, is ""Whistle for the Choir,"" the album's one moment of rest."
2,Needs more cooking,"I bought this phone through Skype store and then returned it. It would automatically disconnect from the network. I could not hear the other person every other call. It reacts very slow to the keypad. The few available ringers are awful and not loud enough. It's a nice toy, but it cannot replace the land line. I instead bought Philips VOIP8411B and it works nicely."
1,Buy something else,This phone worked for a while but then some of the keys started malfunctioning and was very hard to make calls out of it. I got an IPEVO and it has worked 100% better than this one so far.
2,"Functional, but with a very short range","Right out of the box, the phone would not connect to my Linksys access point with WPA encryption. I had to upgrade the firmware on the phone to the latest version before it would properly connect. Could only place clear calls if I was in the same room as the access point. I have a D-Link DPH-50U USB-to-telephone adapter which works 100x better, for much less money. If you need on-the-road skype service, I think that the Nokia internet tablet is a better choice. I returned my SMC Skype phone."
2,Not ready yet,"This phone has promise, and does work. It shipped with a software bug that made it look like no connection was made, when it really did connect wirelessly. I had to research it, download, and update the phone with almost no tech support. Fortunately I do this sort of thing for a living.This is currently a geek item, not for regular users. Next generation may be more user friendly. On the plus side, it does work, does call anywhere just like my laptop, and with the headphone jack has good sound. That means the built-in ear port is too hard to hear, btw."
4,skype every where!,"This small phone device is pretty cool, I like it,you can take it with you any where! you don't need to have a pc or a laptop to use the skype service, you can connect easily to the wireless network even if it is not an open network you can enter the password, unlike the other devices which only permit access to the open networks."
3,A-Ok,These boots last 5-6 years.I used them mostly for winter atving. I also studded the tred with hex head screws for traction on ice.
2,Okay video,This is a stretching video that is low beginner at best. It has more light toning work in it then stretches. I was wanting a video that would have relaxing stretches to increase flexiblity and this wasn't it. I would recommend Autonomy Stretch or Karen Voight's Pure and Simple Stretch or even a yoga tape.
4,Buns of steel.,"Ranma is attacked by little men who look like pork buns! It turns out that Ranma's pig tail is not what it seems. It is tied with the Dragon Whisker, which if removed, make his hair grow out of control. This movie is not bad and is pretty funny, but not the best I've seen. I give it four stars."
5,Can't stop listening.,Derek's earlier CD was great but this one is truly outstanding. I recommend this CD for anyone who likes Blues style Rock. I'm pretty sure non-natives will like this too.
5,Must have,"An absolute must for a raft trip down the river. The book provides some worthwhile facts, photos and images to provide even the youngest traveler with a certain base of information prior to making the trip.The waterproof pages make the book even more useful, as I witnessed a number of people reviewing it throughout the day on the river without concern for damage."
2,Belknaps Grand Canyon Guide - Not the best,"This guide does not list camping sites. I bought this before I realized the lack of camping. I ended up buying the RiverMaps Guide by Martin & Whittis. It is much much better than the Belknaps. (twice the size, better and more information)"
1,Another bad deal,"Again Taragon presents us with half of a CD [12 tracks] for full price.Hunt around hard and find the really good best of that's out there by both Eydie & Steve, it is out there if you look."
1,Missing!,The purchasing process through Amazon went well. Unfortunately I never received the two items and when contacting the vendor directly through email they blamed my postal company and never received a refund etc. I purchased directly from another website item was cheaper and received within 4 days! Don't purchase from Confectionary House
1,Broke in the first 60 seconds,"My mother was excited to find this for my son, who is a big Dora and Diego fan. We blew up the various chambers, attached the hose, turned on the water, and it ruptured, sending water and pink plastic everywhere. Took more time get set up than he got to play with it.Too bad. It looked really cute on the box, but the plastic was a thin as a beach ball, and could not handle the water."
4,What's philosophy?,"Seriously, I'm not into philosophy and I only read this book for one of my generals. I'm a senior in Computer Science and I thought this would maybe give me a different view on technology. Not exactly, really there is nothing technical at all and it's a really hard to read. After you start to understand his language (yeah feels like a whole new language), you start to understand his meaning. I find his dense sentences to be necessary though, after you start to understand what he's saying it gets pretty entertaining.Thing is you can get everything in this book online somewhere, and some guides that will help you through it. I read better with a hard copy, which is the only reason I bought the book. Turns out this guy is pretty big in the philosophy world, so it's a good read if that stuff intrigues you. Personally, I'm going to stick to programming and stay ""enframed""."
2,Red BayONET Filter.,"Probably works very well on whatever lens it fits. Item description said 39mm BAY red filter. I skipped over the BAY thing and was expecting a 39mm red filter for a Leica lens. Not so; I returned it. When I re-read the original listing I found bayonet in the fine print below in the description. My bad; still think the seller should spell out BAYONET in the title. For an under $10 item, who's going to read the fine print?I really thought BAY RED was some sort of dark red filter, or whatever. Already own a couple of 25 red filters in 39mm thread.."
3,Neutral thoughts...,"I play this game on a gameboy website online, and I have neutral opinions on this game.The good:- Nice 3D graphics- Cars go at a good speed for a gameThe Bad:- Only takes one hit to arrest a criminal on level 1- When you hit a sunday driver and there are cactuses or telephone poles on the roadside, you hitting the obstacles is a guarantee.My ratings: Detail: 9/10, Graphics: 9.9/10, Fun: 8/10, Overall: 8.9/10So I give it 3 stars. Nothing awesome, nothing horrible."
2,Shortest Game boy game ever!!!,"I got this game in high hopes that it was really fun. As it turns out, On my first try I beat this game in 20 minutes without even getting a game over! I almost lost on the 7th level which IS the last level and you have to chase an armored car. And would you believe I never fired a single bullet at any of the cars you were supposed to chase??? I didn't know how!!! All I did was ram them many times.The graphic for this game boy game had pretty good graphics, sort of 3-D.You could even tell if you were going up or down a hill.All in all, I do not recommend this game to anyone but little kids who have had not much expirience with the game boy."
3,Prince of Tennis - music live is not as good as music anime,"I found this to be a very entertaining listen at times, but the voice qualities are not the best. I liked the songs and the dialogue. I laughed a lot, but for the music itself, I will continue my search for a set of songs from the anime itself. I think the voice actors in Prince of Tennis, the anime, have much higher quality voices."
1,This book is just plain stupid,"This one of the most riduculous excuses for a book I have ever read. Yes, the CD included is full of great music, but the book is a complete waste of time. Buy a rock and roll cd collection somewhere and save yourself the agony of having the book to read.It's amazing what can get published these days."
2,why mince words?,"Con: un-scientific treatment of scientific jargon, ill-defined theoriesPro: lots of interesting pictures"
4,"Lacking ""a"" visual appeal","Although there are several interesting concepts there lacks a visual presention of workshops and the architects' present works and ideas. You become curious about the mention of the ""Research Institute for Experimental Architecture"", but it leaves the student wondering if such a school ""a reallity"" or a concept. I recomend this title if you are looking for a deeper meaning of architecture in regard to architectural space and are willing to except a new vision on life as we knew it."
3,Graco SnugRide Infant Car Seat Base - OK,"I bought this for my Graco Stylus travel system.Pros:- Relatively easy to install- Light weightCons:- I never feel like the car seat is sitting SNUG on the seat. Even after I tighten the belt as much as I can, the car seat moves a bit (not a whole lot). This concerns me as I thought that the car seat is to sit very snug."
3,YOU DON'T NEED THIS!,I thought i needed to buy the base separately when I bought my GRACO Snuggleride car seat - but you don't. The same base comes with the car seat. You only need this you have two cars with the latch system and don't want to move the base (which is not hard to do) from car to car. I should also say that you don't need to use any base at all with the carseat - the carseat comes with instructions on how to seatbelt in just the carseat carrier part without the base (which is what lost of people do in non latch cars anyway - althoug the base can be seatbelted into not latch cars too). If you have a latch car it is safer to use the latch system and the base - but the carseat can also be seatbelted in just like in the nonlatch cars. Latch cars are cars built after 2002.
1,does not work with all snugride car seats,"The description is deceiving. The price was attractive which is why we went with it, and there was no indication that it would not work with any snugride infant seat. However, we realized that we were wrong. We have a Graco Chadwick infant car seat and this base does not work. I wish I had done more research before purchasing. Please update the description so other people don't make this same mistake."
1,Does not fit SnugRide 30,We ordered this base as an extra for the SnugRide 30. It does not latch properly. We returned it after three days of trying.
1,For Infant model seat only,"I thought I was getting a good deal on an extra base. Turns out that this base is compatible with the Snugride Infant (4-22 lbs) seat ONLY. It will not fit any other Snugride seat. The product description doesn't make this clear, nor does the packaging or instructions. Check the Graco website to see which base you need for your seat- it looks like all of the other bases and seats are interchangeable, but not this one."
3,BE CAREFUL!!,"All graco bases are not the same. When you get your seat in the car, check it to be sure that it dosnt rock around a lot. If it does, return it for a new base. some of these bases have an extra hump of plastic in the bottom that keeps the seat more secure in it and others do not. We opened and tried out 6 bases before we found one that we were comfortable with."
3,Make sure it's the right one,This car seat base does not work with Graco SnugRide 32/35 seats. Just make sure you order the correct one.
1,Incompatible with most Snugride carseats,"All Snugride carseats with numbers (e.g., Snugride 30) work with all Snugride bases with numbers (e.g., Snugride 35). The Snugride (without a number) base only works with the Snugride (without a number) seat. The product naming/numbering system that Graco uses fails to convey this information."
1,Does not fit Snugride 30 base,"If you are buying a base for the snugride 30, this one does not fit! Go to diaper.com and buy the base for snugride 30 carseat only, it is a little more expensive but it is the exact same base as the one that comes with the carseat."
5,Hard to find in stores,The base for the snug ride was very difficult to find in the store and that is why I used them and it worked out. Great price too
4,Great for second vehicle,"We have a Graco Snugride that came with a base. We purchased this base so that we can have one in each car. The seat snaps directly into the base and in order to remove the seat you must press one button. It is that easy! My only complaint is that when placed in the middle seat of my car, it is difficult to fasten the seat belts of the two side seat, especially on the driver's side."
2,BEWARE!!!!,Be Careful!!! I have a Snugride 35 car seat and this base does not work!!!! It has a 22lbs limit listed on the sticker. Do not order this base if you have Snugride 35!
3,Not Secure,"The manufacturer recommends use of the base up to 20 lbs. I would strongly disagree with this recommendation. I would not use this base for any baby that weighs 15 lbs or more. I purchased the Snug Ride Infant Car Seat with base and matching stroller. Using the base made it easier to get the car seat in and out of the back seat of our two-door car. However, once my child reached about 15 lbs it started to tip over when turning corners, so I had to stop using it. I had it fastened using an shoulder belt, and could not figure out the use of the latches."
3,It's a must have but diffiuclt...,"This base is a must have if you are using an infant carrier in two cars. We have the latch system in both and it took us awhile to install the bases and have a secure fit. I couldn't imagine having to go through that everytime we wanted to switch cars. In fact now that they are in I won't remove them. I wish it was easier so we could go in our in-laws's cars,etc."
1,should say 5-22lbs in title,You have to read very closely to know this is not compatible with the snugride 30. Even the box it comes in does not say it is for the 5-22lb carseat.
1,Pay attention to compatability comments,This base is not compatable with all the Graco units (including some with which it may claim to be) so buyer beware and read the reviews.
5,Great for 2 car families,We have 2 cars and this was perfect so that we didn't have to keep taking the base out and putting it in the other vehicle.
5,Graco infant carrier base,I ordered a second base for our second car and it was the best idea ever!! Now we don't have to keep moving the original base that came with the infant carrier.
5,Needed an extra,Needed an extra car seat holder for my husband's car. This worked great and was very affordable. Thank you very much.
1,Scary instability with 3 point seatbelt,"We purchased this because of the safety ratings. If you're fortunate enough to not be forced to use a 3 point seatbelt with the base, then maybe it's fine.With the 3 point restraint, with a towel under the base, and my husbands 230lbs pushing into it, and the clip on the belt (that the instructions say to use), and the belt locked for a child seat (pulled all the way out and then retracted with all of my weight on the base), you can easily flip the base towards the back rest of the seat. It actually seems like the tighter you make it, the more unsecured it is.I don't see how, in a rear end collision, your infant wouldn't be face planted into the seat, and that scares the crap out of me."
4,Graco carseat base,"This base and the Graco system in whole are great, however we did have to put a blanket under the base to get it to level up in both of our vehilce (a 2004 VW Jetta, and a 2002 Dodge Dakota).Over all I would recomend it to friends and family."
3,This does not work with the Snugride 32,I accidentally got this car seat instead of the one for my Snugride 32. It does not fit! Being called the Snugride I thought they were all the same. There is no info in the description that would point you otherwise. Other than that there was no way for me to really test it out because it didn't work with my car seat.
1,Not secure without latch system,"We have an older Lexus without the latch system. The Snugride 22 base seems secure at first, but after a few minutes or if you pull on it, it gets super loose. One day we got it in as tightly as we could only to find the car seat tipped completely on its side after a short ride in the car. Scary!This is our second child and we have put in car seats many a time, and even had our first one checked my a specialist. How in the world do you people get this base in securely (up to regulation) without using the latch system? I'm not convinced it's possible.I don't think there is another base you can use with the Snugride 22 other than this one: http://www.amazon.com/Graco-SnugRide-Infant-Metallic-Silver/dp/B004B7KJR2 anyone know otherwise?"
5,Great for Grandparents,We bought this base so that our daughter and son-in-law would not have to bring their base on the plane when traveling to visit us with our little grandson. Works perfectly with their Graco Snug rider infant seat!
5,Great product,"I purchased this product for my hubby's vehicle and we LOVE not have to transfer the carseat back and forth all the time. It works great, highly recommended."
4,Just as described,This extra base works perfectly with the Graco Snugride car seats. We got an extra one for my husbands car so we could take either car when we go out and it is the same as the one that came with my car seat.
5,Graco Snugride Infant car seat base,"I had already purchased the car seat for my son and his wife, and then realized that we needed extra bases so everyone had one in their car. It is far easier to just put the car seat in the base which has already been properly secured in the car. I keep this one in my car so I have it ready when I watch my grandson, and I also have it in case anyone else needs to use it. The car seat fits perfectly, and the price was fantastic. However, I would highly recommend for the safety of the baby that both parents and grandparents or any care giver have their own base secured in their car."
5,It is what it says it is,"It is what it says it is. It is the infant car seat base for specific Graco infant carriers. Not much to say, it works."
5,Great for second car or grandmother,Love being able to take baby in my car when babysitting. Easy to install and carseat snaps right in.
3,SnugRide,"Slips around in the back seat.I used some shelf liner, (rubbery kind), underneath and it did help to keep in place. Not just my car it moves around in my mom's also."
2,Not what the picture shows.,"Ordered this because the picture matched my other car seat base. When it was received it was not brown and tan but ALL tan. This base as pictured was priced $12.00 more then the all tan base because I assumed it was two toned like I wanted to match the base we had for our other vehicle. If I had wanted all tan, I would have ordered it at the lower price."
1,Not Safe,My mother-in-law purchased us the SnugRide Infant Car Seat w/ the Silver base and Jogger Stroller. I must say the base is horrible. It slides all of the time and the majority of the time my daughter is tipped sideways while I am driving down the road. I cannot tell you the amount of times I have had to pull over and buckle that base in again. Thank goodness for her 7 year old brother who can sit beside her and hold onto the seat when it is connected into the base. The infant seat is much more secure when used without this base.
1,Graco SnugRide Infant Car Seat Base,base tilts the more you tighten it using a three point seat belt!
5,Love it!,I have three of these bases. One on my truck one in my hubbys and one in grandmas truck. It was super easy and a time saver not having to take one base out and move it each time we switched what truck or person had my son. Its a great thing and I just wish his new seat had bases like this now that he grew out of that style seat.
4,excellent intro book,"There are full-scale reviews listed here so I won't re-hash.Mr. Mosley appears to be a very sincere and authentic individual who seeks to help others. His case histories and anectdotes are both educational and entertaining. Also humility is present here as the author reveals a deal that fell through because the other side had a personal dislike for him. I don't in any way construe this as Mr. Mosley being a bad guy; quite the opposite--this is a big and diverse world and certain people, for reasons out of their control, will clash.I would highly recommend this book as a starting point, then if one is interested in pursuing an invention, acquire FROM PATENT TO PROFIT by Bob DeMatteis. The latter is a very in-depth college course-type textbook that would work optimally in a classroom setting, or for those who can dedicate time to set up a homework schedule."
2,How to be a boring individual,"The first 1 or 2 chapters of this book do indeed give you some good pointers on how to build rapport and to look for common threads, all very important parts of a conversation. However the latter chapters really get dull and tend to advice the reader to shy away from responding openly to real life situations such as when a friend approaches you with a problem, the author advices that you shy away from really putting yourself in their shoes and offering help, rather it gives you advice on how to decline offering help to someone in need. It also advices the reader not to tell jokes in any situation or to shy away from tellign detailed stories. Whilst for a social lepper this maybe sound advice most of us want to live in a world full of excitement and have conversations that are fullfilling for everyone, not just being a bore and trying to ""fit in"". Perhaps as an Brit this book is very American centric, but I'm sure even Americans are not even so boring!"
4,The Art of Talking to Anyone,"The author provides savvy, helpful ideas on improving communication in all situations. Very good."
2,The Only Need For This Book Is Female Influence In The Workplace,"It's not that this isn't good book as you have to have it in today's society, its that its really written so men can know how to work with women or men with no male hormones. The points are vaid, but if you have ever worked in an al male environment then you would never need this. Men don't say, ""You sure could have done a better job on that eyeliner."" The say, ""Hay, racoon, if you screwed that up any worse someone might be tempted to call animal control on you!"" Another good example would start with, ""Are you an idiot?"" Ofcourse you can't talk to women this way as it would be rude and hurt their delicate feelings. So if you work for a women or in an office with a bunch of them, this would be a good reference. On the otherhand if you work with men of any stature, this would be just plain foolish."
2,Not for me.,"I've seen very little improvement since I began using this product. I wouldn't recommend it. In comparrison to perscription meds, this doesn't really seem to do much to improve my abilities to be more attentive or remember things, which the ""Extress"" also doesn't seem to do much to help with either. Unless I change my mind and decide to order it one last time, this one didn't seem to do much to help me."
5,You Spin Me Round...,I had to call up KBIG (104.3 in Los Angeles) to get the Title and Artist for this song. Thanks KBIG!! It's a great CD single. Get yourself a copy and enjoy it!
3,Clock big ben dual bells,"Clock was much too expensive and not too durable. It is already dead, unusable."
2,Excitement turns to Sadness,"I was initially happy that I had found this classic clock. I always keep a wind up clock next to my alarm and use it anytime the weather indicates the possibility of high winds or inclement weather so I know I have a working alarm clock. The generous size and strength of the bells was certain to wake me. Unfortunately, when it arrived, the hour hand was broken and would not keep time. I looked at it to see if I could fix it but it was sealed and I could not see the inner workings. I contacted the shipper via Amazon and let them know of the condition it arrived in. They were accommodating and processed a refund in a timely fashion. I was disappointed that I could not get a replacement clock and my only option was a refund, but they were timely in that. In the future I will continue to look for a similar clock, but that will be another review"
1,It was broken & returned,"The item was broken, I returned it, you gave me credit, then you charged me again. I have not reordered.I did not pay for it when I paid my bill. Please correct this mistake. Thank you.Euna G. Rugg"
1,didn't work for me-No Mac support,was supposed to work with Mac but didn't and horrible support. Buyer beware!
3,Interesting but arcane,"I found the premis interesting, especially the ideas expressed in the first chapter. However, some of the alchemical ideas in later chapters seemed totally irrelevant to the act of painting. Nevertheless, it is a book with ideas you won't find anywhere else."
2,What Alchemy Is,"I think the title of this book is misleading. It should be, ""What Alchemy Is"". Most of the book is devoted to an overview of alchemy, with a few relatively modest observations about the nature of paint and how the artist relates to it and to the experience of painting. The book might have been more worthwhile if the author had at least been successful in demonstrating more clearly his point, which was to show the relationship between alchemy and painting, but the connection here between the two is not very convincing. I almost never write any of these reviews, but be forewarned if you think you are getting a book about painting, because this isn't it."
4,A most unique explanation of the painters experience.,"This book closely describes the chemically creative experience of an artist, most specifically a painter, in the studio enviroment. Where paint, pigment, brush, canvas, and the mind come together."
5,Excellent,"I am not a painter, nor an artist. I am interested in the creative processes in life. I found this book entertaining and enlightning on many levels."
5,Better than I even expected.,Was in better condition than I even expected. I'm very pleased and would definitely purchase from this seller again.
2,Disappointng,"I was so eager to get this book! Finally my high school Latin might pay off! I wanted it to truly be a useful reference guide. But so far, after trying to find a dozen terms from plants in my own garden, I came up 0 for 12.And the lookup can be annoying because the publisher made an artistic decision to leave the right edge of the book untrimmed so the pages are all a little different width. Because of this, it's not really possible to fan the pages one at a time - they flop 20 pages as a time. So to locate a term, you must turn each page."
3,Gardener's Latin: A Lexicon,I eally wanted something that was more helpful than basically a listing of latin plant names.
4,Enjoyable fun reference book...,"This book has helped me to understand the stages of development my new kitten, Princess Elizabeth Talker Mischief Wafer Fritter Gremlin Peekaboo, has just gone through, is going through and has yet to face. The author details everything from the various kinds of cat foods and litters to the minutiae of grooming (a soft toothbrush is helpful for the face and around the eyes) as well as body posture meanings and socialization requirements. There is a lot of good information, and I am sure I will refer to it again. Though I think some of the information, on dental care for example, could have been more in depth."
4,Plato Reincarnated,"Clifford provides the only known (by me, I admit) Platonic writings of the last several hundred - or maybe two thousand - years! Plato himself wrote dramatic dialogues in which believable characters discussed and debated issues relevant to not only their own times but to all time. Since then, philosophers and other scholars have written innumerable dry treatises and analyses of Plato's dialogues, but hardly any have written dialogues in the Platonic style, and those who have tried (Hume, Abelard, Berkeley . . .) have fallen 'way short of Plato's verve, wit, and wisdom. Until Clifford, anyway. His are truly dialogues in the Platonic manner. Witty, relevant, provocative, Platonic, and philosophy that relates to ""the real world."" Kudos!"
5,great music!,If you enjoy Classical music and Christian music you'll love the beautiful way this lady and the orchestra weave classics of both styles of music together!
3,Die Cast Z3,"I own a navy blue Z3 which is why I purchased this product and this happened to be the only one that I could find online. After I received the car, I was a little disappointed in the detail/quality of the car. Especially, since the total cost was over $20 including shipping. It is not as nice as the die cast cars produced by Burago."
2,NOT ALL FACTS dont purchase for beginner,These cards are well made however all facts are not included. I wish I had read the review before purchasing. This is ill suited to the purpose I need them for but okay for someone that already knows 0-12.
4,Good,"I liek the cards, they are very useful. I just wish you didn't have to share cards from other numbers to make a complete set."
1,TERRIBLE HYDYRO TOOL,"Although the packing was convenient and the price was reasonable, the product was awful and a complete waste of time and money. Once I place the chemical on the patch, the patch immediately began to curl up and became stuck on itself and I was unable to get it to straighten out so that I could apply it to the surface. Clearly the material was to thin and of poor quality. I would never use this product again nor will I recommend it to anyone else"
4,Worked great.,Excellent service. Fast shipping! Product worked well for the small hole we had in our pool liner. Even under water.
2,Not satisfied!,It might would have worked on dry material but it advertised being able to apply underwater. I was not able to ever get a good underwater seal.
4,"Glue is good, just use a piece of Your own liner","Had a hole about 1.5"" in diameter in Our 11 old 25 gauge liner. after ready some of the reviews I decided to try something different. went to home deposit and picked up there best vinyl repair glue. cut a few inches of My liner off a side of the pool under the deck. glued up both of them and let them sit over night. the HD product pulled apart with no effort at all. the Hydro Tool glue did not come apart no matter how hard I pulled. Now I now My test was outta the water. drained the pool and cut a new piece of liner and put it over the hole. let it sit for 5 hours in the sun and it wont come off. warning do not drain you pool as its impossible to get the liner to go back to its original shape. but the glue should work the same under water. just use a piece of You own liner and put something heavy on it for a few hours.... Just had to order a new liner because I drained it........"
1,Pool Liner Repair Kit,When applying the glue to the vinyl it starts crinkling and shrinking up before you are able to finish. For repairs made under water I gave up. It would not stick.
2,Not a Great Book,There are so many better books out there. This book does no subject justice. Too general.
1,Very disappointing. I would have expected better,"It's unfortunate that the American Academy of Pediatrics would use this book to push their political agendas about gun control. On page 394 it says ""The American Academy of Pediatrics strongly supports gun control legislation. We believe that handguns, deadly air guns, and assault weapons should be banned. Until handguns are banned, we recommend that handgun ammunition be regulateed, that restrictions be placed on handgun ownership, and the the number of privately owned handguns be reduced.""People who are buying this book are looking for baby advice, not political garbage. It's sad that AAP would stoop so low to include comments such as this.We received this book as a gift, and I'm sorry that anyone spent money on it."
5,One of the best books I have,"Of the small library of child-rearing books that I started collectin before my daughter was born, I believe this one has to be one of the best.""Caring for Your Baby and Young Child"" has great tips, much reassuring information, and a very straight-forward presentation of information that is easy to understand.I've found this book invaluable mostly for health issues (what's that rash, do I need to worry about this thing she's doing, etc). It also has excellent information on behavior and temperament, particularly if used in conjunction with a book like Brazelton's ""Touchpoints.""this is definitely a book I'll be holding on to throughout the 5 years!"
4,Great reference book,"I really like this book. It's a great reference tool and is a great place to start when you want more information on your child. It could be written better, and since it lumps kids ages together (i.e. 4-7 months) then sometimes it might be hard to find info on a specific age. Otherwise I think it's great if you like to be informed. Also, it gives the recs from the American Academy of Pediatrics which is nice to have on had. I think it's a really great book to have around the house if you have kids."
4,Solid reference book but not exactly a page-turner,"This book is filled with good, scientifically-researched advice on your baby's health. It does, however, read like a reference book, and it is often as exciting as reading a dictionary.My personal preference was to read Baby 411 as sort of an overall guide, then refer to this book as issues pop up. In other words, use it just like a dictionary!"
5,Really useful,"My nanny and I refer to this as we have questions related to my 1 1/2 year old son. I continue to be surprised by how consistent are my son's behaviors with the patterns described in this book. The toy and game suggestions are helpful, as are the meal time suggestions and approaches for teaching safe and unsafe, good and bad behaviors."
4,Child care,This book is very good in helping to find information about babies and toddlers up to the through the age of 5. If covers child development and helps the new mother understand the needs of the infant and child.
5,I ;ove this book,"Great condition I bought it for my Brother, My wife and i used this book with our twins and it was beyond insightful and practical."
4,Good reference,"I've had a lot of different books about pregnancy and raising babies, and this one has been an all-around handy reference. Good to have on hand, and I look something up in it every once in a while, but at least for me too long to actually read cover to cover. But since it's quite comprehensive I still recommend it to new moms to have on hand!"
4,Caring for your Baby,Bought this book to have while babysitting my grandchildren as to what should be normal growth and development. So far it has been informative as an reference book for me.
4,Great long term resource,This was a wise purchase made after several books were reviewed from the library. We wanted to have a resource handy and this made sense since it covers the first five years and not just one. We like that it is objective and not full of opinions like some books. Sometimes things are hard to find in a pinch (hence only 4 stars) but overall there is a great deal of useful information and the book is organized well. I'd have given 4.5 stars if I could.
5,One of if not the best,"I bought this as a rookie parent 12 years ago. We have many of the other popular baby books and this is the most informative and useful you will find. I have been buying it as baby shower gifts for other rookie parents. When asked a few months after receiving the gift, both mothers and fathers agree it is the one they use when they have questions."
3,NO Ice Pack,"I ordered this thinking it was the same as the C20, but with just one dish. I have used the C20 before, and it worked great. However, this model does not have an ice pack, which I was not aware of when I bought it. If you are feeding dry food, it should work just fine. But I do not want to leave canned food out to spoil, so I returned it and bought a C20 instead. Just make sure you are aware that this does not have an ice pack or a place to put one. If you are okay with that, then you will probably like this feeder."
2,Very hard to latch and opened easily by dogs,"I did a lot of research on Amazon trying to find a one meal feeder for my dog who needs to eat 3x/day due to inflammatory bowel disease. This was not only hard to use, but she could get it open right away, which negated my attempt to space out meals while I'm at work."
1,Skip this one!,I was very disappointed in the quality of this product. We left our cat overnight only to find the feeder had never opened because our cat was able to easily knock the battery loose. I don't know if there is supposed to be a battery cover but this did not have one. I am returning this item as it was useless.
4,Works as advertised,"I was tired of kitty cries at 5:00 am. He would sit at the end of my bed a cry as loudly as he could until I got up, even if it was 2 hours! This has stoppped the crying. I set it for 5 am and actually got to sleep in. The only thing I wish it had was a ice pack for canned food. But for the price, its well worth a -finally- good nights rest."
5,"Happy cat,happy cat owner","I bought this feeder a few months ago and couldn't be happier with the results.My cat used to constantly beg for food waking me up early in the morning and driving me crazy all day. At first he tried batting the feeder around but stopped when he couldn't get it to open.Now he sits by it when its near his feeding time and will occassionally get it open when the dial is almost ready to open anyway. No big deal. He no longer associates me with food even though he watches me fill it and close the lid. Once fed he is content knowing his ""magic box"" will open again the next day. I plan to buy a second one for back-up. I never want to be without this feeder again! Happy cat,happy cat owner. Pat in CT"
2,Save your money,"Simple review...this is a poorly designed product that my daughter's cat easily broke into the first day she had it. We followed the recommendations in the instructions, but the feeder is light weight and poor quality. It is not worth the approximately $30 I paid for it. I cannot recommend this product."
3,Not really up to the task for dogs,Our new dog (a pug) has to spend some evenings alone and this seemed like a great solution to her dinner feeding time issue. She's only about 18 pounds and as far as she was concered this was just another hide the food toy and she thrashed it for about 10 min until it popped open. I then mounted it to a slab of 3/4 in ply-wood about 15in square thinking this would give enough ballast that she could not get it open. WRONG. It only egged her on and it took about 15 min to get it open then. It is now sitting in my garage waiting for a garage sales next spring so I can get some of my money back. That said it worked as advertised and if you had a cat or much smaller dog this might work out ok.
5,"Good product, happy cat!","Have enjoyed this product thus far! My cat can get his breakfast when he wants it, and is much happier (as am I) in the mornings. I gave the product 5 stars, but one thing to consider is that it is very quiet when it opens. My cat sleeps upstairs and his food is downstairs, so he doesn't hear it open, but I think after a few weeks of using it he has started to figure the timing out.So overall, happy cat = happy owner!!"
3,Simple product but material could be better,"It got its job done. It's a very simple product, and the timer is really easy to use. However, the material used to assemble the feeder is rather cheap and could have been of better quality for the price I paid. The cover is very flimsy, and if you try to push the cover down when the knob is not exactly aligned, the cover snaps off the entire unit and is very difficult to put back. I know that doesn't make sense unless you actually see it happen. I almost returned this product but was not unhappy enough with it to go through the troubles. Some reviews said it's so flimsy the cat can paw the cover off. My cat hasn't figured that out yet, but when that happens, I suppose it would be time to look for a new one. If you have a young cat, or one who's not too bright, I guess this would be great."
4,More Than This Review,"Jesse hates living with his father, stepmother and stepsister. When his mother comes to visit, he jumps at the chance to go back to California, since everything is miserable at Clearwater Crossing; including things with Melanie. When Brittany, his stepsister, runs away, he has second thoughts and the two try to patch things up.Nicole and her cousin Gail are in BIG trouble when Mr. Roarke catches them giving food away. Gail has to date Mr. Roarke or else they are fired. Will Nicole have the courage to tell anyone about this?Melanie goes to Iowa to visit her aunt Gwen. Gwen is her mother's sister. She keeps thinking that since she broke up with Jesse, things were never going to be the same. A friend of Melanie's mother gives Melanie a present before she returns to Clearwater Crossing. It turns out to be a book--that belongs to her mother."
5,Good book,Laurie Halse Anderson is a wonderful writer!This book is so good along with the whole series!
4,Great!,I love how Laura Peyton Roberts leaves you on edge every book! I'm eager to find out what will happen with the gang. I hope everyone will survive their relationships and 8 Prime. Not one of her best romance novels but it still drew me in. I finshed it in a day so that tells you something! I recommend this series and this book! Happy reading!
5,Great!,"I have not yet read this book, but I can only assume that it will be great! I'm dying to know what happened to Caitlin and David, and Melanie and Jesse! What does the cover mean? Is Melanie mad at Jesse now? Hopefuly by the title that she isn't. Great job to Mrs. Roberts for making this great series!!"
2,This thing gives me a headache,"This has got to be the most complicated and convoluted meter I have ever used. I think you must need an engineering degree or have some background in electronics just to get this to tell you whether an AC outlet is hot or not. Almost every time I use this I have to refer to the manual and then when I do get it to read I'm afraid to trust it. I haven't replaced it yet just for the sheer fact that I shelled out $90 for this thing.I wouldn't wish this meter on anyone and I certainly wouldn't buy it again.There are plenty other meters out there that are easier to use.The only plus to this is that it really will do just about anything you could want, you just have to figure out how to set it up."
1,Rotary Cutter Blades,"Poor quality, had lots of nicks in blades leaving them unusable.Someone at the company should inspect these before sending out."
4,it cuts,Does what it supposed to do. Wish they weren't so expensive. If you are cutting fleece it doesn't last very long. Wish there was a way to sharpen them. Not much to say other than when they are sharp it makes a nice cut. Buy them when they are on sale!
1,Rotary cutter,Cheap plastic construction. Button to retract blade gets tripped during cutting definitely suggest a better quality one!!!
5,Blades are Exactly as Expected,"These blades were exactly what I expected and work fine. They are high enough quality for the price, especially getting a 5-pack. I have on complaints but I only do occasional cutting. If you cut daily, you may want to spend money on some of the supposedly super sharp and equally super expensive blades."
3,"Sharp, but scarred Olfa cutting mat","These blades fit my rotary cutter (KAI RS-45) and made nice smooth cuts through the fabric. BUT, they scar my Olfa ""self-healing"" cutting mat. So, I would not recommend them if you plan to use them on a cutting mat. In contrast, I recently purchased replacement blades made by Olfa (45MM also fit my cutter) and no scarring."
4,Great Product as described,"These blades are just as described, just like the stores and at a wonderful price if you do much quilt cutting they save lots of time. Thanks for the quick service."
5,They don't write like this anymore,"Harold Acton is all but forgotten today. But he was the center of the Bright Young Things of London, and before that a Brideshead-like entourage at Oxford. All of which he writes about in an engaging and witty memoir. This should be better known today than it is."
5,Filter for my camera,"This is a pretty cool filter. If you spin it around it will totally change the depth of color in the picture. Very happy, you should get a case to protect it."
3,Hoya Filter Evaluation,I was unaware that this Hoya filter was single coated instead of multicoated.It is for this reason that I gave only 3 stars.
2,"Good overview, very boring.","This was one of our main texts for a class on the Ancient Rome I just took this semester. The information in here is solid, but in many (most) parts of the book I was bored to tears...something I've rarely said about any history book. A very dry read. Truely devoted students of Ancient Rome or Classics may find this book useful, casual readers or general history buffs I suggest look elsewhere."
1,Really Bad...,"What is the appeal of this textbook? I am enrolled in a HIST 334 class at the University of North Dakota and we are required to read this book for lectures. The students have told the teacher that this text is very dense and exceedingly difficult to read. The teacher admits it, and told us just to read every first sentence of each paragraph... This book is a headache to read. It is fact piled upon fact without any unifying narrative. Also the text lacks primary sources. Like every 15th page is a small excerpt from Livy or Cicero. I dont understand how this text is so popular among scholars, I love history but hate this book...."
4,GREAT SHORT BOOK,This book was great for a basic understanding of the rise and pinnacle of the Romans. It explained customes and archetict very well. It also does a great job at explaining the different cities and villages.
5,A Great Camera for Paranormal Research,"I have been using this camera over the course of about a year and have produced amazing clear shots, even in the dead of night. I belong to a local paranormal research group and I can highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good camera for that type of research. The only slightly negative aspect to this camera that I can think of is the flash recharge rate between shots. You have to wait a little more between shots when using the flash. Don't let this issue put you off of owning this camera. You won't be sorry."
4,Olympus C-770 review,The size of this camera is very good. It fits comfortably in the hand and is not too bulky to carry around sightseeing. The clarity of the pictures is very good and even when I think I may be shaking the pictures come out sharp and clear. The only complaint I have found so far is that the dial for setting the shooting mode switches too easily so the next time you get your camera out it may not be in the same mode you left it in. It would be better if the dial clicked and stayed in a little more snugly. Mostly I like the camera alot and the price is better than the competitors.
2,Hip/Hop Rap tempo that I did not like as worship music.,"This has a definate Hip-Hop/Rap tempo. Many of the songs are difficult to understand and worship the Lord to. These brothers put out great music, this just wasn't one of their best. They have smooth mellow voices that do not fit the Hip-Hop/Rap style."
5,This Album changed me,"When I first heard this album in 90 - 91, I was going through a rough time (worst in my life). The album's lyrics ministered to my hurting soul. I think it is one of the best gospel albums I have ever heard. It's upbeat and contemporary sound can reach out to both old and new. It shouts JESUS and His love for us. The Winans are true luminaries. This album is must give gift to anyone struggling or going through things."
4,A must have for me!,I remember my mom playing this CD when I was a kid in the early 90s and had to get it for my own gospel music collection. A Friend and When You Cry are two of my favorites! Highly recommend this one!
2,Nice little parts but the most is s***,The parts with the octospiders are interesting and also the ending part about the cosmic philosophy. But there is too much soap opera again...Bulls*** again! Read the first Rama book!
5,Limited Edition Book - TARC,Rre book - rare project - a singular pro bono project by young architect working with communities within San Francisco and the wider AIDS communities.Actually the credits should read Mark Kessler and Katherine Lambert - Architects/ Collaborators / Authors
2,Cailou's Train Trip,There are too many commercial in between the movie. The children don't understand commercials they just want the movie other than that it was a good movie.
1,Love the series -- puppets are disappointing!,"My 19-month -old daughter and I have recently fallen in love with this sweet series. I was looking forward to adding to our budding collection, but was sorely disappointed in this (as well as another) DVD.The puppets are horrid. I can't imagine what the producers of this show were thinking. There is a tremendous discrepancy between the wholesome and sweet tone of the cartoon and these awful (sarcastic) puppets. It's so disappointing, I want to send it back."
3,Puppets and skits need to go,My 20 month old daughter is totally in love with Caillou and we have a bunch of DVDs which are great. This one I did not like that much because of the time wasted on puppets and skits in between. My daughter keeps asking for Caillou back every time they come on. Other than that it's ok.
2,Where's Caillou??,"Santa brought this DVD for our near-3 year old as she loves to watch Caillou on PBS. Now, I understand that it is a Canadian production - I used to live in Canada, and I'm well attuned to the differences between American and Canadian programming.However, I have to honestly say that I have never seen, nor never wish to see again, the multiple silly (read: idiotic) segments that take place between Caillou episodes. Dancing children with someone singing (sounds like the person who voices Caillou), a little girl going on a car ride with her mother, etc.My daughter kept coming over to me and asking ""Where's Caillou? I wanted to watch Caillou?""I wanted to say ""Well, honey, Santa obviously messed up big time with this one...""If you want all Caillou, which I'm guessing all Caillou fans want, this is not the video for you. We are/were very disappointed, and this will sadly make it onto either eBay or into the back of our media cabinet."
2,A little disappointed...,"I was a little disappointed for this video because instead of recieving pure cartoons, it contains few of them. The majority of the video is just a bunch of animals talking..MY KIDS HATED IT!!"
3,All of Them,"My grandson who I care for 24/7, will be 2 yrs. old on Aug 10th has been watching Caillou since he was 1 1/2. He loves Caillou and stops whats he's doing just to sit and watch him. He humms to the song and can say his name too. He likes all of them but especially loves the Train Trip and Christmas one because he loves trains and santa HOHOHO. There is just something about that sweet boy's voice,bald head that captivates my grandson's heart. ..........He loses interest in the puppets. Why did they have to insert that puppet show in every DVD? Thats a waste of space.HEREFORD,TX"
3,Caillou DVD,We bought this DVD for our two-year old grandson. In between each Caillou story is a section with puppets. Our grandson didn't like the puppet sections. We have to FF through these. Would prefer just Caillou stories.
3,"Love Caillou, hate the puppets","I bought this for my 2 year old because it's his favorite show on PBS. I had no idea about the puppet segments in between episodes. They take up half the dvd. He hates the puppets. If I had read the reviews before hand I wouldn't have bought this one. Other than that, it's good."
5,Caiilou's Train Trip,My 20 month old grandaughter absolutely loves this video and would watch it as many times as allowed!
4,The Caillou stories are great for preschoolers!,"My 3.5 year old daughter absolutely adores Caillou -there is something about this little bald-headed 4 year old boy with an unusual name and a boisterous personality that just captivates her. The DVD here contains the following episodes: We All Love to Travel, Caillou the Explorer, Caillou's Sailboat, Caillou's Train Trip, Exploring the Neighborhood, New House, New Neighbors, Garage Sale, and Supper with Sarah.The stories themselves are interesting and educational. My only grouse is the puppet segment where we have Caillou's stuffed dino, and pet cat Gilbert among others doing their own thing. It is quite annoying, and my daughter doesn't care much for them. I think they've cut those segments out in the more recent Caillou stories on PBS [thank goodness!], but this DVD still has those segments. Yet, it's nothing a fast forward button can't help, and I would still recommend the Caillou series for young children, especially the 2-4 age group."
3,Caillous Extras,"My 2 year old daughter loves Caillou, but wasn't very interested in the puppets that take up at least 1/2 of this video time. Still satisfied the Caillou fix, though!"
1,"Not familiar with this ""Caillou""","Caillou is whiny and there are these puppets that disrupt the flow of the episodes. My 22 month old gets upset with the whiny/crying Caillou and the puppets. I am sticking with the episodes made from around 2006 and later. When I figure out which ones they are, I'm gonna create a list of these DVDs so that no one makes the same mistake of buying this one."
1,Not what we were expecting....,"We bought this dvd for our 3 year old. While she loves Caillou, she did not like the puppet shows at all. Plus, what is the point of showing Caillou having a temper tantrum during the opening credits. (Thankfully, I found a few reviews on here letting me know what dvd's don't have the ridiculous puppet shows.) Since, our daughter won't give this dvd the time of day, it was definitely a waste of money."
1,caillou train trip and other adventures,"I purchased 3 Caillou DVDs for my grandson and this one just stopped working in the middle of the story. I originally thought it was my DVD player, but the other DVDs play fine. I will be returning this item for either a replacement or full refund."
2,Rude little boy,"Caillou frequently talks to his parents and others in a rude, bossy tone, and they let him get away with it.There's usually a moral to each story, but I'm afraid it gets lost in the bad behavior."
1,yuckity yuck,jumpin jupiters i can't believe people like these this is a piece of trash caillou is extremely cheesy and i can't stand caillou 1st in don't go away i'll be right back was yuck i can't stand my kids watching this and threw it in the trash veggietales rolie polie olie digger and friends dale earnhardt inc adventures little bug and friends robots are all highly better pbs kids johnny fry and caillou much be ashamed
5,Sad but TRUE,hey umm i come from family with this... It is true and very much still around and DEFINATLLY NOT outdated.
3,"I like it, but...","It's a nice mold I really like it, but I think for the price I spect more. I found lollipops mold the half of the price here in Puerto Rico, but the only thing is there's weren't any one of buttons. But, if you decreased the price will be going to be nice."
4,Works great,"The only real gripe is that the top and bottom sleeves can get stuck given the hamburger shape of the wallet, so it can get somewhat annoying trying to pry them out every time. Aside from that, it's a great price, a little retro looking (not a bad thing), with enough disc space to handle any road trip."
2,Mistake,"The fit is too tight, the zip gets caught every time. And if you have filled up all the pockets, the disks get stuck in that tight space. I should have bought a square one, I have another that is square and that works great. A mistake to buy this!"
2,?,LOVED the music. Love the Singer. The CD Scratched right thought the song I Needed. Disappointment. Even though the price was cheap. (without shipping of course) Need to find another Brooks Geenen's CD.
3,Not for the new commer.,"The book is simply a time line of the major, and some minor, events that defined the early Baader-Meinhof/RAF. The book is written in a manner that implies you already have at least some knowledge of the RAF. The book is not about the groups politics but simply its actions. Short sweet and helps put everything in chronological order.On the downside, no time is spent investigating individual events in great detail. The plane touches down then takes right off again. You are given a paragraph or two of info. then next topic. The cover is deciving because it says ""1963-1993"" but the book only really speaks about the first generation of the RAF. With their deaths in prison a very slim amount of book is left to talk about the actions of the later generations.A good timeline for someone who already knows about the RAF. Not enough info. for someone new to the topic."
2,A book with a hard-to-define style...,"Was this meant to be a chronology? Or did Vague intend to write in clipped, newsreader style, much as the RAF itself was reported on the TV news? In any case, the book is difficult to follow for anyone who is not familiar with Baader-Meinhof and the Red Army Fraktion, and if you ARE familiar the information is presented in so many snippets that it would seem to me to be annoying.I was in Germany during the tail-end of the RAF (a period scarcely mentioned in the book) and found myself learning very little more of any relevence than what I had already found out."
2,Nothing we haven't heard before.,"There is nothing new here. If you're new to the subject of theBaader-Meinhof gang, you'll get better value from ""Hitler'sChildren"", even with its innacuracies. This book reads as an almost edited version of that."
3,Not the best thing you can find,"This is a short chronic of the German terrorist group Red Army Fraction - not very detailed but quite accurate. One weak spot however - the author seems to have some understanding for this band of mad murderers, which is itself hard to understand - at least for me."
5,"Saved my life, she did!","I heard Beth perform ""Life Holds On"" at a Farm Aid concert and it saved my life I think. I've bought this CD about five times now. I keep giving my copy away to folks that NEED to hear that song!"
5,Wonderfully upbeat- the best prize I ever won!,"I was the 12 th caller on our New Age Jazz station and was sent this true jewel of a CD. Beth has a magical voice and her ballads have such special meaning, you can't help falling in love with them . I would highly reccomend this to anyone. My 12 year old daughter knows all the words and we share this special music together. Treat yourself to this diamond, it is a very special collection of music"
4,"Functional, but not much to look at","I like the tray underneath - good for holding pens and whatnot. But this thing is cheap plastic through and through. Gets the job done, but nothing sexy about it."
1,Kindle version unreadable,"I wish I could have worked my way through this book. The other reviews rave about the story and it has great potential. I just couldn't get through the version on my Kindle as it was unreadable. Strange line breaks, missing words, odd punctuation. Is there an updated, better version?"
4,Nice set very usefull,"I bought this set when I got a tractor to play around with. I realized I could no longer use manual tools very well anymore and I soon wished I had bought this a long time ago. It's not the absolute best set you could buy, but for the price it is very good. I would recommend that you purchase a wider range socket set than what comes with it, although they encompass most sizes the average job would need."
1,drags on and on...,"After the first four pages of this book you'll be wishing for Tina to find plumber Mr. Pettifog and the story to be over! The Illustrations are catchy and beautiful but the story is a bore. My daughter likes to just look at the pictures, she to, gets bored after about four pages!"
4,Let Go!,"CD contains some great covers and early versions of their own compositions, most destined to become latter hits. The sound is in mono as recorded for TV broadcast. The Wild Pair sessions (the last five selections on the CD) are mono as well, I own the stereo LP and would have liked the stereo versions included on the CD instead. Unfortunately I understand that those master tapes are unavailable or no longer exist; too bad those songs are all great and are produced by Jack Richardson as well! Thanks to Marv Polanski for preserving the tapes, he had much more forethought than the CBC!"
3,Where is Burton Cummings?,"This CD is all sung by Randy Bachman. A bit of a misnomer to call it The Guess Who without Burton Cummings. Still, a fun CD to listen to."
4,Matches everything,"Love these. After buying the yoga mat sanuks, I was expecting these to be a little more cushy. While they do have some arch support, its not alot. Quality materials, they will last a long time, which is good because I wear them with everything!"
4,It's a truly enjoyable Christmas album,"I have always been a huge Frankie Avalon fan and think this CD is very good. I was actually hoping this CD was done more recently as Frankie's voice at the present is even more enjoyable as can be witnessed in Grease and his more recent CD, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which by the way, in my opinion is great. I am very glad I purchased this Christmas CD and beleive it would enhance anyones Christmas musical collection."
5,Definitely a Must-Have,"This CD is a wonderful, truly timeless collection of new Christmas songs infused with several familiar Holiday favorites. Each song stirs it's own Christmas magic with a beautiful score, which sounded to be performed by a full orchestra. The amazing score, plus Frankie's tender, heart-felt renditions of each song make this CD a Christmas must-have. My only regret is that there are only 12 tracks - can we lobby for a sequel?The track list includes:1. A Merry Christmas 2:142. Blue Christmas 2:573. Christmas Magic 3:134. White Christmas 3:205. You're All I Want For Christmas 3:126. Christmas Holiday 2:097. Christmas and You 3:048. Dear Gesu Bambino 2:429. The Christmas Song 2:0610. Christmas Medley 4:2411. I'll Be Home For Christmas 3:1512. Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas"
5,Transformational!,"I discovered Designing Powerful Training in 1999 in a graduate program on instructional design. I was a good designer before I began using this book...and it totally transformed my design ability for the better. In fact, it gave me the confidence to become a full-time instructional designer, which I have been doing ever since, and an instructional design coach.The book focuses, in great detail, on HOW to think about design. It gives a step-by-step process for doing this. Instructional design requires discipline and this book hands it to you on a silver platter. It does NOT address in any detail how to conduct a needs assessment, how to evaluate training, how to work with graphic design, or how to create learning materials. What it focuses on, though, is superb and it has been one of the primary influences on my career today."
4,Designing Powerful Training Has Impact,This book is exactly what I was looking for to design a more impactful training. I reccomend it if you are looking for a step-by-step approach to get you started.
4,IF you Like Bert...,"In the re-issue world NO COMPANY does better than Taragon...take it from an oldies collector. This beautifully mastered CD sounds fabulous. I actually bought it for one song...Toy Parade (different tune that the ""Leave It To Beaver"" theme of the same basic name). I heard it for the first time this holiday season, and it was love at first sound. If you are a fan of Bert's sound, and even probably if you're not, then this one song is worth the price of admission alone...all the other tracks are gravy. Note: The Instrumental ""That Happy Feeling"" is his best...pick up that song too if you get a chance. ENJOY!"
5,Christmas glee from a master!,"I have proudly taken this gem out every Christmas since I got it way back when. The arrangements here are superb, classic Bert. All arrangements are wonderul, and this album, along with the Christmas Album from the Hollyridge Strings, are forever to be played at that special time of year, as long as I'm around!!!!"
5,It was a new approach to Christmas music.,I enjoyed the music in this CD. It was very relaxing and enjoyable. It added a very different approach to our Christmas collection. We are now ordering more of Bert Kaempfert's music.
2,It Stinks,"It literally stinks. I've been airing it out for over a week now, but this thing offgasses a smell that reminds me and my classmates of skunk. You can smell it from meters away and it will give you a headache. It also does not lay completely flat by itself because of the folding feature, but as a cutting mat it works. A year ago I bought a different cutting mat (same size but not foldable)from carpe diem store online for $25 plus shipping. I think that was a better deal, since the mat did not stink, it cost less, and it is thicker than fiskar's so it will probably last longer."
5,Essential for the science writer,"The dictionary that's used by many patent attorneys, and should be used by every science writer/editor."
3,Revisited,"Don't know it this is that original. I expected ""An Evening (wasted)..."" The mix of talking and music was such that I kept having to turn up the talking part and turn down the music part. Still, it is Tom Lehrer..."
3,Clever but dated,"Lehrer was the sophisticate's song writer when I was growing up in the '50s and '60s, I was suprised at how many of the lyrics I recalled. Few of the songs are really worth listening to now, other than for nostalgia sake. ""Be Prepared"", however is a classic."
5,Comedy collectors must have,"College students in late fifties sang these songs everywhere. They are still as funny as ever. The only one missing is the Yachting Song that he sang at a performance in a small club in LA ""Let's go out and sail together! Let's hang over the rail together...""I hope he is alive and well and still composing. Rickety tickety tin, with gin! (Julie Guenther)"
3,Too stuffy for my taste,"Though I am highly educated, I found the book's tone to be too formal and academic to make it an enjoyable read. It might be difficult to digest if you are not used to reading texts full of big words and complex sentences. I also did not like the author's point of view in that it seemed a little too one-sided in its anti-advertiser stance. I only made it through the first chapter because I found these aspects of the book to be a turnoff. Though the book does contain interesting information, I think that there are a lot of more enjoyable reads out there on the same or similar topics."
4,Packed with Practical Tips..,"When reading business books you are often faced with three choices: 300 pages to describe one diagram ; 300 pages to describe one ego (why I fixed the world/corporation) ; or 300 pages on clever theory with no idea how to make it happen.Thankfully this book is different. It has a range of practical ideas to turn strategy into reality. It has some novel insights into making BPO work, and uses theory about blueprints to help make decisions.The style of the text is quite wordy for me (bullet points are about all I can handle) - but there's good sections at the end of each chapter about what does the thinking mean for me - and that's really helpful. It answers the 'so what' question."
3,very good rice cooker at a modest price; the warming feature is valuable,"On the positive side, the warming feature allows you to increase the cooking time for brown rice, by turning the cooker down to warm once the water boils and then finishing the rice on the cook setting. This takes a little experience. On the minus side, the non-stick coating of the pan seems a little thin."
1,Avoid this cheap rice cooker,"I've never had great luck with Elite products, but this was cheap and small and I just needed something basic. After using it a half dozen times, it started switching off mid-way through, so I'd cruise back into the kitchen a half hour later ready to prep dinner and find it still full of water. After another five or six uses, it won't switch from warm to cook at all anymore. I should have bought a slightly better Aroma rice cooker instead of contributing this one to our landfill so quickly."
5,Great,"I really enjoyed adding ""A Song will Rise"" to my collection. This had many selections that I did not have by them and found this a really positive addition."
5,Happy Music,"I always loved Peter Paul and Mary when I was young and had all their records. I was happy to find that I could get their music on CD and have listened to the CDs I purchased every few days.In the 60's, you could actually understand the lyrics of music."
5,"A Song Will Rise by Peter, Paul & Mary",I purchased this CD for a friend that had the orginal album many years ago and could no longer play it do to damage. He was thrilled to get the CD and said it was just as good as he remembered it.
5,Love Them,"""For Lovin' Me"" is probably the best track on this album. I have all the PP&M albums. No one can ever replace Mary Travers"
4,Great product for specific lens. Expensive.,Purchased this for my Nikon 200-400 zoom. Works great but is VERY expensive for what you get.
5,Nikon C-PL1L Slip-in polarising filter for 400mm f/2.8 lens,"Product works as expected (well, it is made by Nikon, after all.)Vendor was problem-free - I would happily deal with them again."
4,Does the job,"Does what a CP filter is supposed to do. I typically haven't used it much, but when needed, it's available! Having to turn a thumb wheel to rotate the filter isn't as handy as just spinning one around with your fingers at the end of an open lens. But having a LARGE one at the ""end"" of an f2.8 300 mm prime lens would be a lot more expensive!"
4,Great!,"My daughter loved this from about 4 mos. to 9-10 mos. She kicked away at it. The music is very pleasant (classical!) , has volume control, and 3 different settings.Like some people have said, it would be nice, maybe in future versions, to have alternative ways to mount it, or a stand of some sort for playing on the floor or something. My daugher also played with it when she was a little older, by holding it on her lap and pressing the keys. Since, as with most baby toys, it's still in great shape, I'm passing it along at a baby shower this weekend. I just hope my daughter, now 14 mos. doesn't pitch a fit when the mother-to-be opens it! We'll both be sad to see it go. It's one of those things.Deinitely recommended!"
2,Not versatile enough to be worth the money,"This is a kick piano, not a hand piano and as such it needs to be mounted in a baby's crib. We thought it would be useable if we just held the piano in place for our daughter to kick, or for her to use her hands on the keys - it isn't. As we use her crib for sleeping, not playing, this has been a total waste of money.At 10 months my daughter is now able to sit and press the keys on the piano with her hands, but the response of the keys isn't instant and the noise is so soft that she doesn't recognise that she's making it work. Her sister's toy xylophone with twice the number of keys, an obvious sound and an instant response to her touch is far easier and far more satisfying for her to use."
2,Not what I expected,"I BOUGHT IT TODAY FOR MY 3 MONTH OLD AND, I'M NOT HAPPY WITH IT. IT'S TOO BULKY AND HEAVY. SCARED IT MIGHT FALL ON MY LIL GIRL IF NOT TIED TIGHTLY ON THE CRIB, I PREFER THE ORIGINAL KICK AND PLAY PIANO. IT'S THINNER AND LIGHTER THEN THE PEEK A BOO. THE PEEK A BOO PIANO KEYS SEEM HARDER TO MAKE SOUNDS. MY DAUGHTER REALLY NEEDS TO KICK IT IN ORDER FOR IT TO MAKE MUSIC. THE ORIGINAL ONE WORKED WAY BETTER!! MY OLDEST CHILD USED TO KICK IT SOFTLEY AND IT STILL MADE SOUNDS. MOST LIKELY WILL RETURN TOMORROW."
3,Nice Shirt.....but,"The shirt itself is very nice, however, there was a quirk. I don't know if the issue was particular to the item I received only. I order size 17 36/37. Lol, the neck sizing was correct, but the sleeve length literally stopped halfway between my wrist and elbow. It was at most a 32/33. I can usually get away with 34/35 so there is no way this shirt was even in the ballpark of 36/37 (as the tag and order stated).Like I said, I really liked the shirt. Just not sure if I had a mis-cut or not. Darned Sri Lanka manufacturing!I am giving it 3 stars under the assumption this was an isolated error. If not for the sleeve length, I would give it a solid 4 stars as the shirt is nice.Amazon has a solid return policy so no problems here. I am 99% satisfied with Amazon most of the time."
3,Not bad for 1927,"Written about 50 years after the battle, Reedstrom included a remarkable number of photos and illustrations in his book. He injects wit and insight between lots of mater of fact technical material as he led us up to the battle by the middle of the book. The second half, catalogs uniforms, tactic manuals, horsemanship, and weapons. He concludes a rather objective view of the ""Red Man"" including a lesson in Indian sign language for over 150 words. This book is worth having on your Custer shelf."
1,RUST?!,This product rusted after the first use. Clearly a piece of JUNK! Are you sure it was intended to hold REAL water?
4,Interesting but occasionally opaque,"Greeley is a fascinating author. Thusfar, I've only read his sociology. This is a collection of his columns for syndication in which he attempts (with varying success) to be an ordained Mike Royko.It's tough to tell exactly what Greeley thinks on a lot of subjects because his writing tends towards self-contradiction, sometimes even in the same column. In general, though, it seems that he espouses the sort of comfortable suburban Catholicism that I've come to reject myself (it was only in reading this book, the first Greeley I've read in two years, that I realized how radically my views have changed in that time and to what extent I continue down my path towards a much more radical form of Catholicism than even what I hold now)."
1,A Major Disappointment,"This book has very little specific information about the Aussie and a lot of general dog information better presented in other books. For example, I was looking for grooming information on stripping and was told to ask a breeder. The issue of bathing a hard coated dog was given the answer, bathe the dog as you like."
2,"so,so",Did not give me the help I needed :( my dog is headstrong. The book did not give me any insight as to how to solve her bathroom problems. I tried everything already that was in the book. Nothing New :(
3,Some interesting info. Some boilerplate content,This book reads like a standard text about dogs with some specific content about Aus Terriers added. Good enough.
1,This Game sucks,"This Is a terrebile game to play, it stinks and i wouldn't buy it for nothing, i wouldn't even take it if it was free. it was boring and the characters attack moves sucked. It was a little bit challengeing. but it was a crappy game.If you liked this game then check out all of the rock & bullwinkle's games, movies, cds & books."
4,Works well,My husband has been having trouble with his wrist and this product was recommended.He had been applying it now for about a month and has seen a marked improvement.I use it as well and love that it really absorbs in nicely!
2,Hardly any Characters,I have played the N64 mario tennis and it is awesome! But this game is nothing like the N64 version. This game is boring and only has a few characters from the Mario series. The graphics are okay. I really hope they come out with a Mario Tennis For the GameBoy Advance that is more realistic. I am also very Happy they are coming out with mario Golf Advance Tour.
2,Second service,"This is not a bad game, but it definitely leaves you wanting more. It's cute but it's not a winner, the controls are not quite there, after a couple of hours of play you start to get frustrated with it.The horrid graphics and sound is a big turnoff.As the title implies this isn't the king of tennisgames on the GBC I'd go for Snoopy any day in the week."
4,TOO EASY!!,"Mario Golf is my all time favourite game, so when Mario Tennis came out i thought it would be really good. I was a bit dissapointed. This game is so well designed and so much fun to play. The only problem is that it's so incredebly easy. There are about 2530 matches you play throughout the whole game in singles and doubles, and not only did i not lose a single match, but out of the 100 plus games (6 games to a set, 13 sets to a match), i lost about 58 games all up. Even when playing in the final tournament and when i played Mario, i didn't lose a single game. It's actually possible that if i started playing the whole game again, i could win 95% of all points. Really fun gameplay earns this game points."
4,fun but not enough mario characters,"I am obsessed with this awsome tennis game! There are alot of people to choose from . But sadly, there are only three mario characters and two to unlock. In addition to mario tennis there is a RPG mode ! It took me 15 hours to beat it! Now i need to get the n64 version to tranfer some mario characters to the game boy color version with a transfer pak! Get this but don't expect alot of mario characters!"
3,Good game,"dont get me wrong this is a great game, but it took me 2 hours to beat it. ther is only 1 tournament when you make the varsity and then you play mario and then you win. it is also way too easy. i never lost a match. heck, i never came close! unless you have the N64 transfer pak dont get this game. (the n64 transfer pak gets you a lot more characters and stuff)"
4,Worked great,It worked fine and I have been running on it for a few weeks. Hopefully it will keep running fo some time.
5,I'm a fan of this fan,"I bought this to replace the ""warrantied"" one that failed in my 1 year old Trane gas furnace. A Trane dealer wanted $200 to replace this fan and take care of the warranty claim for the ""no cost part."" It's a bit absurd that the no cost under warranty part would cost more to have replaced than what it would cost me to buy the part and replace it myself, which took me all of 10 minutes to do, and I've never worked on a gas furnace in my life. Incidently, I contacted Trane to see if I could get reimbursed for the part. No deal. They only replace it if their authorized dealer installs. Quite a racket. Basically, after 1 year, unless something major goes, the warranty is useless. Next time I'm buying a Carrier."
3,Only time will tell,"six weeks and still waiting on pond to fully clear up, though slight clearing has occurred, so only time will tell."
5,Great to Maintain Pond Quality,Pond quality was maintained all winter without any other additives or water changes. I will always keep a bag in the pond.
2,I stopped ready after 33 pgs. & found reviews and summaries,"The concept is good. But the marriage details that surround it were TOO MUCH. The points could have been given in overview format and much more concisely stated.I got tired of this fast, because I don't have time to read it all. I read about 2 books a weeks, but not when I have to sit through a bunch of boring details.Intead, I like the setup of ""Mastering the Rockefeller Habits."" The first chapter was designed for executives who won't spend the time reading the whole thing, but instead want an overview to quickly grasp the point of the book. These busy readers are then instructed to find the chapters that they are interested in and read up as needed. I recommend reading the whole book, ""Mastering the Rockefeller Habits"" but I like the option to read or just review!Unfortunately, I didn't have this option with ""The Goal."""
5,A Special Album That Stands the Test of Time,"It was in the mid-1960's that I was first introduced to this album by a neighborhood friend. I was fascinated by the electric bassist and the way Kaempfert used voice and orchestra to create his unique sound. I later ordered this album while serving my country at Fort Hood, Tx. I'm greatful to Amazon.com because you will soon find a recording you thought never available. 2 Websites gave me Bruno Walter and this Kaempfert recording that probably no other current music store can offer. I took Amazon's advise, and if you are patient enough, you will find that rare recording at the price you are looking for!"
1,Features are not good.,"This interface is only worth it if you are going to charge your ipod. I find it very inconvenient to change albums or change playlists since you can't do that using your car stereo. It only allows you to go to next song, previous song, pause, random, repeat, etc. It doesn't even allow you to forward or rewind a part of a song. I will be selling mine and getting the one where you just plug it into the headset jack, since the sound quality is the same. I advise you, don't get it, it's not worth it. iPods have good battery life and if you are afraid your battery will run out get a $20 car charger which you will probably use for 30 minutes max to charge your battry full again. I regret getting this product since it completely disables the ipod interface for me to use."
2,"""Where's the beef?""","Bought this as I'm planning to float Westwater and need a River Map i.e. descriptions of rapids, what to look out for, where/what to scout, etc. While it has lots of detail on geologic formations, there are no details on any rapids. None, zero, zip, zilch. It shows them on the maps but leaves it to you to know if it's Class III, Class V, how best to run, characterisitcs at high/low water, etc. Will look for something with more substance."
4,BEFORE YOU BUY,"I found this to be a great mile-by-mile breakdown of the Green River. I hope that future editions list camping areas. If you're in the Moab area, Tex's Riverways sells them for $20."
2,Belknap Grand Canyon Map,There are better maps for the Grand Canyon. This maps doesn't have camps marked on it and no rapid descriptions and limited side hike info.
3,Review,I am a Churchill scholar having read everything he wrote. Some of the quotes and attributions I don't think are accurate or well provenanced
5,Inspiring and Witty,This book acts for me almost like a self-help book to inspire and keep me calm during a stressful day.
5,A Delightful Book About A Great Man........,"Winston Churchill is one of the greatest men of our or any other time. His intelligence, wit, humor and clarity of thought is well captured in this great little book. It's broken down into several sections and it's a quick read. It's a book that I keep going back to!"
3,A thoroughly enjoyable read,"Humes has compiled a marvellous collection of quotations and exceprts from the great man's speeches. Unfortunately, he rarely cites his quotations, making it difficult to put them in proper context."
2,wisdom/philosophy,"I am very disappointed. I obviously ordered The Wit and Wisdom of WINSTON CHURCHILL, but instead received The Wit and Wisdom of BENJAMIN FRANKLIN. Could be a minor error, but it did specify on the order confirmation my original request. I would like to exchange the purchase."
4,Great Collection,"This book makes it a lot of fun to learn about one of the greatest leaders the world has ever known. Delightful quotations and anecdotes! The only downside is that it doesn't give sources for many of the quotations, so it's a bit hard to put them in context. I also highly recommend a book of wisdom by Taro Gold titled ""Open Your Mind, Open Your Life."" Excellent."
4,Its a coffee pot,"My last carafe broke, this one is identical and works the same. Good price, fast shipping, why not? If you don't like coffee, don't buy this."
1,Measurements Don't Reflect Actual Carafe,"I read the reviews that warned about the measurements. I measured my old carafe and selected this one as it has the right height. Unfortunately, the one they sent was an inch shorter. I cannot offer any advice that could stop this from happening to you -- sorry about that. I have sent it back to Amazon. I order from AMZN a few times a month and this is the first time I have experienced this type of error."
5,Just what I ordered!!,I was very happy to be able to replace my carafe when I found a crack in it. I have had my Cuisinart Coffeemaker for many years and I was overjoyed to see the carafe could still be replaced. The most important thing is to verify the exact carafe for your coffeemaker. I still had the guide so I was able to match up the correct replacement carafe number for the correct coffeemaker. I received just what I ordered!!
2,not the item I needed The listing showed this pot matched,Not the item I needed. The listing showed this pot matched my coffee maker by model number. Of course there where two to pick from that would have or should have worked.But of course its not worth the trouble of boxing the pot back up and harrasing the supplier to fix the problem.The on screen info should be fixed thoe.Good service on purchase and shipping
2,Not what you think,"This is supposed to be 12 cups, but it is more like 10 1/2. I got this for my 10-cup Grind and Brew maker. Cuisinart said this would work, & it does if you use the dome-style lid, not the flat one that comes with this pot. Don't waste your money if all you want is a bigger pot--this is NOT a 12-cup pot (I know because I filled up the 10-cup pot and poured it into this pot) At Costco they had both a 10-cup and 12-cup Grind and brew maker. The insides are the same except for the gray strip which shows the water level. So I mistakenly thought I could upgrade to a bigger pot to make a little more coffee when I need to. Wrong! The maker can hold the extra water, but the pot doesn't."
2,So tough to choose!,"My 12 cup Cuisinart coffee maker is the best I have ever owned. Imagine my dismay when the carafe broke and I could not find a replacement in any local store. It appears there are many choices on line, but it is impossible to determine which 12 cup Cuisinart carafe matches my model machine. In spite of typing in the coffee maker model number, the carafe sent did not fit. It would be much easier if the carafe's would be matched with the coffee maker model numbers."
1,does not fit DCC-1000 coffee maker,This coffee pot does not fit the DCC-1000 series coffee maker contrary to what is listed under the description. The pot is too high and does not fit into the coffee maker model DCC-1000.
2,wrong pot for my coffee maker,The carafe was the wrong size for my coffee maker. I had to return and pay postage and reorder direct from the Small Appliance dealer.
5,EOM Replacement,What else can I say - it was exactly what I ordered. This is the original replacement carafe so not much I can say
1,not what I expected,"In the editorial review it says ""he provides detailed advice on buying, storing and germinating, sterilizing soil, indoor to outdoor transplanting---even building cold frames.In the book on page 204 it says ""a cold frame---- consist of a small garden area that is roofed over with glass----""That's it. The detailed advice.I thumbed through the book, and I have not found any plant mentioned with how en when to sow.This book has nothing to do with growing anything from seed.The book was a disapointment for me. Mailing it back to the USA was to expensive, so I'll have to keep it."
2,"Lots of minutae, not much theory","Very comprehensive in terms of actor and crew bios and production trivia, but very thin on theory and discussions about the social/thematic/character underpinnings of the genre and the films that made it so great. I was hoping for more of the author's thoughts on those sorts of things than lists of little known facts about cast and crew and so on."
3,Sadly disappointed,"I had heard that this book would be 'life changing' and so I read the reviews, and went out and got the book. I was really disappointed. The dialogue between Ruth and her email friends was pretty day to day, nothing special. Also, prior to starting the book, I was unaware that Ruth was British, so at times, it was difficult to completely understand some of the slang (reminded me of an Absolutely Fabulous episode). I did enjoy the articles that Ruth wrote that were included in the book. My advice would be to save your money, and watch an episode of ER."
2,not what I had expected,"This book was not the book I had hoped to have bought. I enjoyed some of her emails, the writings by her family, or from readers. However, for anyone who can identify with this statement, it was not an edifying book for me. I expected her to die, of course. That was obvious from the title. I did not expect to find that she was an atheist, as was many of her friends and spouse. Death is difficult, but as a Christian, I know that when our objectives on Earth are fullfilled then our time here is done. I would be totally devastated if I didn't have the hope, the peace of knowing I have a heavenly Father who loves me, hears my prayers, and never allows me to walk thru this journey alone. How sad to find she most likely left Earth without knowing this peace. For me, this book had many positives but sadly, dieing an atheist was not what I had anticipated. Maybe I needed to read it, if for nothing else, but to appreciate what a blessing and comfort my Christianity is for me."
5,Kirby ROCKS!,"Kirby's Dream LandWell, I could get this for free, but it would be easier to play and beat. I found a way you can make it harder. Here's what to do. First, hold the select,B, and up on the control pad. Then, go and click left until you get to 1 bar of life and 1 life. If you have one hit you wil get a game over"
2,"I, a Kirby fan, was disappointed.","There are 5 levels in this game. On my first try I beat 4 levels. It is easy and short! You also can't save the game. If your, let's say, on level 4 and you lose all your lives. Then you have to start at the begining again. ( Kind of like Mario. ) This is the really bad thing. If you turn off your gameboy and turn it on again, you start at level 1 again. It is not fun to keep playing the same levels over and over. I would say this is for little kids that do not get frustiated easly. ( If there is any little kids like that. ) I say pass this up, Kirby fans, and try another game."
3,Uhh...,"It wasn't in very good condition , but i don't know if its my gameboy or this.Graphics aren't very good and i cant see the enemys so its pretty hard.there are black lines all over the place so i cant see ANYTHING"
4,"A great arcade classic, now on Game Boy","When it comes to talking about Pac-Man for the Game Boy, there's nothing I can actually say that isn't already said by other reviewers. It's classic arcade Pac-Man on the go, wherever you are. It's certainly not a bad deal at all.One problem, however, is...well....There's another release of this version of the game for the Game Boy, but with an added game: Super Nintendo puzzle game Pac-Attack. Not only that, but that release also has both games played in full color when playing it on a Game Boy Color or Game Boy Advance.http://www.amazon.com/Pac-Man-Special-Color-Game-Boy/dp/B00000K1XF/ref=cm_cr_pr_pb_tSo I can't really say I wholly recommend this one, considering there's that other release for the same system."
5,"Vachss takes us into a world that Hammett, Chandler, and Spillane never dreamed of.","This is the 2nd time I've read STREGA, first time being several years ago.I don't believe I would want to live in his world, but I do have a morbid fascination with it. I don't think I would want to have characters like Mama, Michelle, Mole, Prof, and Burke himself in my world. Heck, I wouldn't even want a dog like Pansy. Yet, I love visiting them in these novels.Nor do I believe I would honestly want to know Flood or Strega, much less have intimate encounters with them, and yet I find myself dreaming of them.The plot has Burke again on the track of a child pornographer and even on the 2nd living, I lived and breathed for the final encounter. This is a world of sleaze, but it also is a deep insight into the world we are a part of.Read this, do read this, but only if you are prepared to stomach a few hours in this world."
5,"First Book by Vachhs I had ever read, and I was HOOKED!","I picked this book up, intriqued by the cover, and title...After just the first few pages, I was hooked on Andrew Vachhs's styleof writing!! His Burke books give the average ""citizen"" a peek into the seamier side of life... The things that John Q. Public never notices, or Chooses not to notice, yet Should be noticed, if only to make us aware of the horrors that exist, that NEED to be made right! He let's us see the beauty of an ugly thing, the genious in a madman, the warmth that exists in a streewalker, and the hope that lies in a childs eyes.... Mike Hammer, step aside... there's a NEW killer on the side of right.. his name is ""BURKE"""
4,Burke is hard boiled mix of Doc Savage and George Smiley,"Set in New York City in the 8o's, in this hard-boiled plot about Child Pornography, we get a good sense of the realism behind the criminal mind and behavior as well as a realistic graphic depiction of the darker side of New York City.I guess my big problem with the main character Burke is that he is such a self-righteous goodie two-shoes as are his dysfunctioanl band of cohorts cut from the pages of Doc Savage and Smiley's People. His heart of gold meshed with his criminal background doesn't seem to cut real for me.The ending too, was a bit dissappointing and not completely shocking since there are plenty of precursors to let you know there is something wrong with Strega. I think alot more could have been done with it."
4,The 2nd book in the Burke series,"Ex-con Burke is hired by a mob princess for vengeance againstperverted day-care workers who scarred her friend's young son;soon he finds himself under her spell, and ultimatelylearning what made her the witch-- or ""strega""-- that she is."
3,"Beautiful book, but no intros for the recipes","I collect cookbooks (and own about 2,000), and three of my all-time favorite authors are Edna Lewis, Vertamae, and the Darden sisters -- all of whom are African Americans. Their books are written with incredible warmth, and introduce each recipe so you'll know what to expect, and why it is special to them. Although Cleora Butler appears to have been a singularly gifted and accomplished cook, I didn't get the ""warm fuzzies"" derived from other African American authors. I had bought the hardcover edition, but ended up giving it away ... as a Northeastern WASPwho knew little about either African American or southern cooking, I really missed not having warm intros or descriptions of the recipes. This is a real shame, since Ms. Butler appears to have accomplished wonders in that environment during that period, and I really wanted to love her book."
5,Almost There...,"I enjoyed all the selections except one. I am one that does not like to hear syrupy violin additives to my jazz standards. You will find disk 2, number 10 ""Here's That Rainy Day"" with that style. I gave it 5 stars anyway."
3,Musically entertaining film for any Glenn Miller fan.,"In the 2nd (and final) motion picture appearance of Glenn Miller and his Orchestra, the 1st being the 1941 film ""Sun Valley Serenade"", the music overcomes a somewhat hokey plot. To see as well as hear Glenn Miller, Ray Eberle, Marion Hutton, Tex Beneke, and the Modernaires performing their hit tunes of ""People Like You And Me"", ""At Last"", ""Serenade In Blue"", and ""I've Got A Gal In Kalamazoo"", plus the dancing of the Nicholas Brothers, is more than worth the ""price of admission"". Another ""must have"" video complement to any Glenn Miller audio collection."
3,Note on DVD vs VHS audio,"This film rates a 4/5 for the music. I own the DVD and VHS versions, and just want to confirm what some others have posted here:DVD 'Mono' is 100% monoDVD 'Stereo' is 100% fake stereo (and it sounds lousy)VHS is mono in the dialogue and what appears to be the original stereo in the musical numbers plus some of the bridging dialogueI can't speak for the Laserdisc, but the musical numbers on the VHS version sound MUCH better than either track on the DVD. If you like this movie's music enough to listen to it on its own, you owe it to yourself to find a copy. Quite an amazing blunder (cost decision?) that the original stereo is not on the DVD."
4,"Above par, musically...","As would be expected, the music is wonderul. Glenn Miller pegged the ""sound"" of that generation and with his untimely death, his is the sound that will forever be identified with the WW2 era.If you listen to ""Serenade in Blue,"" there is a haunting quality that lingers with that particular number, but the arrangement is classic Glenn Miller. The movie is worth having just for the soundtrack; a great catalogue of Glenn Miller music when it was fresh and new, and the incredible voice of Pat Friday, the singer used to dub over Lynn Bari's vocals. What a shame they couldn't have used Ms. Friday's eyebrows, as well! There is more action in Lynn Bari's eyebrows when she ""sings"" then in any other aspect of this film! No wonder she never had an ""A"" movie career. But still, beyond her overactive ""emoting"" during her vocals, the film is worth having for the musical numbers; each a slice of life from that time in our country's history."
2,Disappointing,"I had completely forgotten about this singer until I heard a snippet from her during the movie L. A. CONFIDENTIAL. I ordered this CD and was disappointed at how everything just seems to blend together into the same orchestral schmaltz, with little variation of dynamics or tone color. It was nice to hear again Joni's voice, but she doesn't do much with it. Peggy Lee, Jo Stafford, and June Christy released classic albums during the '50s, but this CD doesn't belong in the classic category. Lovely cover art."
1,"Not for serious cooks, or anyone needing accuracy","If I could give this product zero stars, I would have.You can't measure the spices from the carousel, you have to pick up each individual spice container, flip open a door, and then turn the knob.This might not be a problem for casual use, but the so called 1/4 teaspoon measurement can vary up to an extra 1/4 teaspoon. I checked it ten times in a row and got a different measurement every time.Also, do not try to use spices that are in anything but powder form. Minced onions, doesn't work. Thyme leaves, doesn't work. Rosemary, dill weed, basil, oregano, none of them work.If you are just looking for something to organize spices and really don't care how your food tastes you might consider buying this.And if you just need organization, regular spice racks have been doing a fine job for years and are cheaper."
5,Excellent - makes history come alive,"The invasion of Canada is one of the most engrossing books on history I have ever read. Ms Berton brings to life the characters, events and atmosphere of a continet on the brink of war. This is achieved by Ms Bertons skillfull blend of historical research and artistic licence, which give even the most uninspred reader of history something to get thier ""teeth into"". I found it avid reading and look forward to sampling more of Ms Bertons work."
5,Simply great!,I wish that my history books back when I was a kid had been written like this wonderful book. It'd been easier to remember forever...

3,it's ok,"nothing about his childhood.alot of ""play by play"" of all episodes of ""Dobie"" and ""Gilligan""but i enjoyed it. will read it again."
3,"Too much Gilligan,too little Bob.Maynard was fine.","I was a big fan of Dobie Gillis,and I loved seeing what Bob Denver's favorite episodes were.Some of them were my favorites too,like when Dobie and Maynard discussed their future after graduation from High school.Maynard was a great character that Bob Denver had the chance to add real depth to.On the other hand,I ODd on Gilligan reruns and had little interest in the Island show.I'm sure those sections about Gilligan's Island would be great for superfans of the series,and there appear to be many...but I'm only marginal.Bob Denver told little about his own personal life in the book-his upbringing,previous jobs and the like-but that was his choice and I'm sure he wrote the book more for fans of Gilligan and Maynard than those who wondered about Bob Denver himself. If there had been more about him I just might have bought the book instead of just skimming through it at a library."
2,Bit of a Denver Disappointment,"Ok,Bio of Bob Denver but I expected more.Nevertheless for all fan's this book gives some insight into Bob and his career."
3,SUPERWINCH MOUNT KIT,THE MOUNT KIT IS DESIGNED WELL AND IS A GOOD FIT FOR THE ATV IT WAS ORDERED FOR. IT DOES TAKE SOME TIME TO MOUNT ON THE ATV AS IT IS A CLOSE FIT IN A HARD TO GET TO SPOT. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT IN THE PRODUCT FEATURES IT STATES THAT IT COMES WITH A ROLLER FAIRLEAD FOR SMOOTH CABLE PULLING AND IT DID NOT COME WITH ONE.
4,Mounted,"Mount is very well made & holds the winch quite firmly.However, the install is no mean feat. It requires considerable disassembly of the front frame components. Plus, lifting of the fender.Also, the mount would not clear the frame with the roller assembly attached. It lacked about 1/2"" clearance.To accommodate this I attached the roller to the front bumper down tubes. Strong, but required the drilling of 2 holes.All in all, given that the ATV is a 1996 model & I was happy to find a mount that worked at all, it went very well.But, this is not a 1 hour task. Nor one for those who are challenged by tools."
5,Buzzing,This a a great dvd...I've been interested in bees and someday hope to have a hive.... Very informative.... This is for the inquisitive and curious... you won't regret it..
1,Useless,"Product does not play ""in my region"". Totally useless! Product came from Germany. This was not indicated in ordering information! Waste of hard earned dollars!"
4,This is simply a collection of videos,"There are some weird images between each video but they don't mean anything. The videos are awesome: Drive, Man On The Moon, Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight, What's The Frequency Kenneth, Crush With Eyeliner, Nightswimming, and Strange Currencies. It's fun to watch just to try to understand what the videos are about. There are no other features besides the videos."
1,Pass it on,"This camera was a big disappointment for me. The pics are really grainy and low budget looking. The camera does not respond well at all to low lighting and the flash discolors everything. The body is really cheap and the lense is hard to clean. I've used the Canon 60 and Nikon Coolpix 2100 and the pic quality was soooo much better.I did not purchase it from Amazon, but I will be returning this camera and getting something here instead."
5,A Great beginning digital camera....,"Easy to use, a great first time camera......if you are an experienced digital user, this may not be the one for you...go up to the 5 series.....batteries don't last in this bad boy, therefore consider nicad out the door....also, a larger storage bucket....gave this one to a friend who was non tech plus and she loves it......."
1,Eats up batteries,I've had this camera for 2 years now and rarely use it. I went skiing this past week and used up 8 batteries for 13 pictures. They were only the regular energizer batteries but this was ridiculous.
4,Good Starter Camera,A good camera for what it offers. I got this camera for less than $50.00. It does eat regular batteries but I started using Lithium and have used the same set for several months now.Other than that it is impossible to find memory cards since this is an older camera. Stores about 30 pics at the highest level. Not recommended if you don't have somewhere to download your pics. Although my friends are glad they don't have to look at hundreds of pics from my travels ;)This is the only digital camera I've had and I think the pictures are acceptable for a 3mp camera. I don't have the problems that others describe. I've taken this camera on two once in a life time trips and caught breath taking photos. However I'm realistic and know that it's not a high end camera that will show you the hairs on a dog from 50ft away. You will take pics similar to a disposable 35mm.
1,horrible at best,"The Simpsons are great.......but not in fairy tale form. The gameplay is very slow and gets old fast. The tunes are catchy, but the story lacks the quality of the show. Overall its a game that no one should purchase."
5,"Classic games... some get em, others don't","Classic Simpsons, Classic Gameplay. If you like the good old days of video games you can't go wrong with this Simpson's title, it is a must have for any fan."
1,worst! WORST!,"This game is terrible. Besides, it's old.Who would want to play a game that already expired by now??!!I can't believe ANYONE would try to sell this trash! Its from 1992, people! This game probably wouldn't even work on your gameboy's, its so old! I can't belive you reviewers are selling this! You sold your brain! That's why it isn't working any more!I don't mean to offend you, but this game is like staring at a wall for 8 hours!"
1,unusable program - save your money,"I waited until now to review, hoping to hear back from Activision, but 3 emails and 2 1/2 weeks later we have heard nothing. Within a couple of minutes of beginning the program it crashes on both our XP computers, blue screen of death, have to reboot. Must be an error in the program.My child has been very disappointed, and I guess we're out $20 too."
3,Not long enough the online game on Nickjr is better,My son (4 years old) loves backyardigans and so do I ... I could not wait to purchase this item for his Christmas. He played the whole game in one sitting... he took longer playing the Nickjr free game on line which was more challenging..there was also a fault in the game and in one section where Pablo has to fit pieces of the puzzle together the last piece would not fit in even though it was the right shape. Besides that however he likes the blasting of the rocks and the whole idea of Backyardigans in space. I hope the designers will make a longer game and include some of the fun stuff that is within the Nickjr online Mission to Mars game.
1,Does NOT work with Windows XP Media Edition,"I gave this game to my daughter for Christmas because she loves the Backyardigans. She had a great time with it until it blew up the computer (blue screen of death). It does this fairly consistently. I have upgraded and/or reinstalled the video drivers and system patches, uninstalled and reinstalled the game, and everything else I can think of. I wrote to Activision tech support right after we noticed the problem, and have never received any reply at all from them. We have completely removed it from our computer. Apparently, I'm out the $20. Don't waste your money!"
5,Quality service,I love classical music and in fact I wanted this for Handel's Water Music. All the pieces are great! The service was also excellent and the CD received on time. Thanks!
2,Screen not as good as Sony's XBRITE,"I bought this laptop under the impression that the new Color Enhanced Crystal View LCD display would blow away the competition. However, when I placed the Fujitsu N3510 next to the new Sony FS550 I couldn't believe the difference - Sony's screen is at least 30% brighter, much sharper, and overall the Sony seems to better built. In addition, the reception on the Fujitsu's built-in wireless receiver was terrible. My Toshiba and Sony laptops were about 5x as fast as the Fujitsu on typical web downloads. I sent my Fujitsu back and I'm not sure I'll buy one again."
4,One of the best house albums of 2006,"A nice change of pace, CHELONIS doesn't push it or rush it, - he does it own thang. Very much in the vein of his GET PHYSICAL label, most tracks here are deep tech-house with addictive choruses and rich vocals - reminds me of ROMANTHONY but more lush production, especially on peak-hour underground house faves like ONE ON ONE, I DON'T KNOW, and more - check out DEER IN THE HEADLIGHTS and LE BATEAU to point the way where house music 2007 might be headed. A nice, varied debut that warrants attention."
2,"looks nice, but inflexible and possible bad design","It is strong leather, but the strap and buckle are not very strong. I believe my APBT could break loose from this fairly easy, but it never came to that because the muzzle is a little big and he pulls it right off with a couple paw swipes. I think the paw swipes could probably break the strap though if the muzzle stayed in place. There is no flexibility to the muzzle so if it is not a perfectly snug fit from the start the dog will slip out easily."
2,"Some nice work, but a disappointing recording","Mr. Galbraith is an accomplished musician and displays some fine work on this CD, but the over all product is not as satisfying as I had hoped. One reason, as touched upon by other reviewers, is that this is a collection of 52 short songs, most of which are less than a minute long. The result, from a listener's position, is that one does not have time to get in to a song, to enjoy what it has to offer, before it is over and the mood shifts again. The second problem, at least on my recording, is the presence of distracting noise artifacts in the background. To me they sound like the rustling of Mr. Galbraith's clothing, or maybe his breathing. It's hard to say, but it is definitley there in the quiet moments between notes - of which there are many on this unaccompanied guitar album. To reduce the distraction from this noise, I need to play the CD at low volume, like background music."
4,Dusty Springfield Taragon Two/Fer,"The sound quality really is great and the tracks are fine. It is a bargain that any lover of 60's r&b, soul and rock could enjoy.Dusty Springfield is truly one of the best singers of our times."
5,"Review by Pennsylvania Game News, October, 1999","""This book is geared to the bowhunter after that trophy Whitetail buck. The text offers tips for concealment and elimination of human scent; methods for selecting effective camouflage;secrets for keeping warm while on stand; and a host of other useful tidbits to enhance hunting success. A must book for every serious bowhunter."" Pennsylvania Game News magazine October, 1999"
4,"Good book, bad title","I read the entire book, save the chapter ""Ladies of Archery Hunting"" or whatever. Good book, but it is for archers hunting whitetail deer, which one would never infer from the title."
3,Pokemon value guide...,"This guide was good, however, none of the U.S. Fossil cards are priced. Only the Japanese Fossil cards are priced.Good value guide if you have a lot of Basic and Jungle cards. The guide also has prices for figures. Includes some nice charts for tracking the value of your collection.You might be surprised what some of your cards are worth!"
4,Pokemon Collector's Value Guide: Secondary Market Price,I was so happy to find this book. My step-son has wanted it for a good while and I couldn't find it. Thank you for such a large selection of books.
2,Doesn't ratchet,"Not a bad phone pouch, but one of the reasons I bought it was for the ratcheting clip, which it does not have."
1,good - but truly dissatisfied,"The quality of the product is OK. Unfortunately I was replacing a glove type case that had worn out with a pouch type case... and... well... it just doesn't work. As good as it is, it is terrible for me."
1,Bait and Switch,"The item sent was not as pictured. The Amazon photo shows a case with a full ""squared"" flap. The one sent has one of the corners ""45 degreed"" as if designed for an external antenna. The RAZR of course has no external antenna. Support could not help ... "" ... too many items to keep track of ... .""But for only 10 bucks ... I kept it anyway while trying to find a proper one for my RAZR."
5,leather pouch,"the item was in excellent condition, fit the purpose, was quickly despatched. i would recommend for any phone users."
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!,"First the negatives--Advertised with a ratcheting clip. Mine has a spring clip which became ""sprung"" after a week of wear. This caused it (along with my new phone) to fall off of my belt several times. Also the felt lining on the inside is coming off.Now the positives--The leather, stitching and magnetic flap.Spend the extra cash and buy the Motorola brand pouch. Your Razor will thank you!!"
2,Nothing innovative here,"I just received this book and now know why it was so cheap. Almost half the book is ""how to knit"" (yeah, I know, should have read the whole title and not just the large print) and NOBODY should learn to knit with novelty yarns. It's just too difficult to see the stitches.Also, there are no projects that haven't been published elsewhere dozens of times. Pretty much just take any pattern and use a novelty yarn. For myself, I use 1 strand regular yarn and one strand novelty. The regular yarn gives it strength and shape; the novelty gives it texture. I was hoping there were new ideas here but there aren't.Only thing I hadn't see before is the jelly yarn, although I can't imagine using it for anything as it would look cheap.Oh well, got what I paid for, I guess."
3,Could be a lot more detailed.,"These are written for mechanics, not DIY'rs, so if you lack mechanical knowledge don't expect to be able to start fixing your vehicle with the help of this book. I like these books as it is generally car specific and is much better than nothing, but it could be more detailed."
2,A little too generic for what I was looking for.,Found that it was not nearly comprehensive enough. I'll continue looking for a more comprehensive one. Not helpfull for the average guy.
4,Works!,"This works fairly well.... it does make it easier then mixing in a wheelbarrel. I've mixed 9 bags of cement... the method that works best... add 1/2 the water then 1/2 the cement, roll it 2 or 3 times and then add the rest. I was using 80lbs bags with cement tint and it was just not working too well for me doing it all at one time.Con:... maybe? The opening was a little too small for my shovel."
3,ehhhh...,"I attempted to use this mixer with 80lb bags of cement to use with Quikcrete walk maker molds. 80 lbs is really just too much for it to handle. It did eventually mix it, but after all the work to roll it and the need to clean the mixer periodically, I found it more effective to just go back to the wheelbarrow and hoe.I wont be getting rid f it just yet though. It is a great idea and effective for smaller batches, just not what I needed it for,"
4,Odjob Concrete Mixer,"This is a great buy relating the low cost to the consistent quality that can be obtained with this mixer. It is fast to use. Although it may be used for a full 80 lb. bag of concrete, I fully agree with the manufacturer's instructions to not exceed 60 lbs. because of the weight factor. I found that splitting an 80 lb. bag for two batches worked well and can be handled with a reasonable amount of strength/effort. The only point of caution that I have is to be sure to completely rinse off the lid and the threads on the mixer container before closing or the grit left there will hinder opening the lid after mixing. Slight tapping all around the lid helps to loosen the lid in this situation."
2,2 stars for the idea,"I like the idea of this mixer, but after I rolled around my first batch and it was still dry in spots, I went and bought myself a wheelbarrow. The lid was hard to get off, the concrete wasn't completely mixed and if you are over 5'3"", rolling this thing around is a pain in the back. A wheelbarrow was much easier and faster. I didn't have to spray it off after every batch. Save your money!"
2,Concrete mixer does not mix,"We wanted to make dyed concrete pavers for our back yard patio, so we thought the mixer would help us make quick work of it. Put in the recommended amount of water and dye in the bottom, then 60 lbs. of concrete on top, rolled it around for a minute or so (which by the way is not that easy), opened the lid and...it looked about the same as it did when we started. We ended up dumping it all out in our wheelbarrow and mixing it with a shovel. It's such a great idea, but the product does not deliver."
3,"Odjob cement mixer, ehh, maybe next time.","My first attempt was a failure hence the 3-stars. I'll update this review once it warms up and I can try again. Overall I like the concept, hopefully it will deliver next time.I guess my advice would be to read as many reviews as possible and make sure you know exactly what you're getting. I'd used both a rented mixer and a standard wheel barrow to mix and pour concrete in the past so I kind of knew what I was doing. This time however the concrete never really mixed in the recommended time and even when I altered the process the result was powdery and unacceptable. I ended up tossing the walkway I'd started and admitting failure. I will try again however."

3,No question & answer at the end of each chapter,I'm preparing for my FPGEE as I am a foreign Pharmacist graduate & licensed. Pharmacy Management was one of the areas on FPGEE blueprint. This book gives you a detailed knowledge on how pharmacy operation on US. But sad to say no question & answer at the end if eachchapter which I needed the most for my exam as challenge on the subject matter. Although at the end of each chapter there is a question for further discussions so it ask you what is your answer to think about. The book gives you a real scenario what was going on on the real world of pharmacy settings. I have the book 2005 copyright I thought I'm buying the latest edition but it's not so but with the price of $8.00 something includes tax & shipping it's a good bargain & it's said used book but looks so brandnew.
5,Pharmacy MAnagement by Desselle,"Got the book within a week, great job with the shipping. As the label said, it was brand new (still is =))...."
3,Sleeve savers,"After a few bib mishaps, this looked like a good alternative. Although great for saving sleeves, it takes a while to dry. I currently happily use the Bibbity and Crumb Chum. If I put my son in long sleeves, I may try this again, but not for every meal like the other combo. But even if I did use this because of sleeves, I'd still use the other two bibs. You can see my reviews on them.For the mean time, I'll hang these up for rare use."
5,Horses love these,"These treats smell very nice - like fresh apples - and even very picky horses seem to love them. I have to admit when I tried one it didn't really taste like much to me, but the horses keep asking for more. I like that they're just apples, with no added sugars, grains, etc."
1,"Spend Your Money on ""22 Immutable Laws of Marketing"" Instead","""The New Positioning"" is one of the biggest disappointments I have ever encountered. I had previously purchased ""The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing"" by Trout & Ries and found it *extremely* valuable. Took many notes and refer to it often. I did not take one single note on ""The New Positioning,"" which is just a tired, uninspired rehash of Trout's original work, and not nearly as solid or concise. Before tossing it in the wastebasket, I want to alert others: Save your time and money for ""The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing."" You'll be glad you did. Trout is, in effect, failing to take his own very good advice: He is engaging in a sort of ""line extension"" that will ultimately dilute his credibility with regard to anything else he ever writes."
3,"What's ""New""?","For someone who has not read any of the authors' (especially Trout's) other books, this has some value. For that reason, I rate it higher than do many other reviewers. However, it is inferior to the original Positioning (by Ries and Trout) and adds very little (if anything) that is ""new"" to the concepts and comments provided in that important book. The value of the original is increased substantially when read in combination with other works such as Levitt's The Marketing Imagination and Barker's Paradigms. Because effective positioning is (literally) a moving target, those involved must be both willing and able to modify that positioning in response to rapid, sometimes major changes in the competitive marketplace. That is to say, new positioning may be necessary. The authors of this book already have an excellent title. Now all they need is a text which is worthy of it."
1,Dissapointing. Cheap tricks.,"It is dissapointing to see one of the founders of the Positioning concept writing such a poor book. There six repositioning example cases worked [...], which don't show any reliable method or conceptual backbone behind. All seem to be whimsy improvisations of ""what might work"" for these companies.Repositioning is shown as a melange of company strategy, branding strategy, business modelling and so on.Worse of all, repositioning is designed after poor and unreliable market research data.Still too much emphasis on communication to change perceptions, and little emphasis on company delivery as the true proof of company intention.The market is not that dumb!Claudio Saavedra, MBA., PhDProfessor of Industrial MarketingSantiago - Chile[...]"
2,Thin and dated,"At 166 page the book is on the thin side, but the it's even thinner contents wise. Mostly a series of anecdotal look at positioning of different large companies with large advertising budgets."
5,You can't lose...,"The Texas Tornados are like the reverse of the old big-box-containing-a-smaller-box-containg-a-smaller-box joke that your sister pulled on you when you opened your Christmas present. The band presents you with a brightly-colored package (graphically and musically) that seems somewhat modest at first but over time grows into a dear treasure. The songs unashamedly pluck at all the heartstrings with no apologies and you have to laugh at their brazen chutzpah. The musicians' credentials are voluminous and undeniable. The melding of Sahm-Meyers, Fender and Jimenez is a classic case of the whole being more that the sum of the parts. This Tex-Mex album is the AM-radio soundtrack for a sunny spring day driving south on Interstate 25 with the top down and a couple of shots of tequila just starting to warm your gut. Only the most pretentious or dour of listeners will fail to get a spiritual lift from this little gem. Don't cheat yourself-add Texas Tornados to your road collection."
4,Texas style fun,"There's that game show on TV where comedians try to make the contestants laugh. If the contestants can keep a straight face they win a toaster-oven or some such. With that in mind I defy you to listen to this albumn without smiling, It's harder than times in twenty-nine. This is fun tex-mex style of the highest order. Flaco Jimenez is a god to me. Doug Sahm is a true classic. Augie Meyers still belts out the cheesiest roller rink organ tones on the planet.(But I mean that in a good way.) Freddy Fender, yes that Freddy Fender, rounds out a steller cast of characters on this jumping albiet short offering."
3,"Educational, but a real pain.","I have been reading this book for school. This book might be for you if: you are very interested in Latin philosophers. you have background in Medieval and Rennisance history. You are well read and have a large vocabulary. you are interested in ""wonder"".I've found that this a very boring and difficult book to read because I don't have enough background and I know next to nothing about ancient philosophers. This book is post-college or college level for someone specialyzing in Medieval and Renn history."
1,Bad Design,I purchased this watch because it was cheap and I already have a roka wear watch the I love. I kept this watch because of the low price. The time is hard to see because of the black face design. I have another watch with black face design but it is easy to read.
2,Save your money,"Its ok, but its very short, you will get through it in a couple of hours. It seems like Marty Bergens short paper backs are just churned out without much substance. When you peel away the table of contents and advertising the book is about 48 pages long.I do not think I got my monies worth."
2,Not at all what was described.,"The package shows two bags of wood *chunks*. What came was more like small wood pieces, not at all chunks like I prefer to use. These pieces don't provide nearly as much smoke, and I have to use a lot more to get the flavor I wanted. I'm also not sure what this picture is of, because the actual product came in just one 10lb unlabeled bag."
5,well trained artist,"This is a wonderful compilation of arias that do an excellent job of demonstrating Marina Domashenko's vocal talent. The works are not only beautiful, but they show how Domashenko's voice is very well developed and evenly full throughout the registers. This shows wonderfully on the first track and on all the Russian arias. I wish there were more solo recordings of hers available. Until then, this will do, and I highly recommend it."
2,Not Comprehensive,"This is a useful starting book, especially if you want to use the forms and templates provided in and with the book. However for understanding of the contractual agreements, I felt this book was lacking for its completeness."
4,Returning to the play list,"This album first made it's way into my collection in the vinyl format in the mid-80's. It's a witty and funny cabaret style performance. Ms. Gulch is a device for the show, she was actually played by Margaret Hamilton, a professional in the truest sense of the word. But in the hands of Mr. Barton she becomes a cynical but humorous character I love to spend time with.It was such a joy to find this available on CD and be able to return this to my playlist."
4,Underappreciated,"This was the first career overview I ever got of Dusty Springfield, and the first time I (a fan since '99) saw the woman herself on-screen. A lot of people don't take it as seriously because it has spoof elements (with Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders present, which Dusty asked for herself). But it's a good overview of Dusty's career to that point (up to 1994-95, when A Very Fine Love was being recorded) and hey, you get Dusty herself talking all about it. Which is appreciated after so many of the subsequent biographical accounts of her life tend to be downers that lean more towards the controversies rather than balancing that with the music and ""good"" times. And lots of delightful archive clips can be seen as well! Well worth seeking!"
1,Missed chance to honor a Diva,"This video misses a chance to pay tribute to Dusty Springfield. Instead of giving us a substantative view of her famous songs and talent over her golden years, it squandered the opportunity by including a silly cameo by 2 even-sillier UK girls who ""interviewed"" Dusty for the occasion, making fun of her trademark beehive hairdo and heavy eye makeup.Consider this video a disparate collage of Dusty's songs put together hastely to get money out of us. Not a single full song but bits and pieces everywhere. A disgrace to a famous Diva. Save your $ to buy Dusty's CD."
5,I miss Dusty!,"I miss Dusty Springfield. I bought the VHS version of this interview with the wonderful Dawn French and Jennifer Saunders as the hosts of a Full Circle. There were some interesting clips from Dusty's musical career. They shyed away from her sexual orientation which was a good thing because Dusty was part of this show and it had really nothing to do with her musical career. She should have been treated better even after her death. Dusty was too shy to talk about her personal life but she wasn't shy to talk about her music, fame, and pitfalls of being sucessful. This program was never meant to do anything to tarnish her wonderful image as one of Britain's greatest female singers. Even now, we miss her still. I'm grateful to the Pet Shop Boys for bringing her back in the 1980s. This video is a must for Dusty fans whether vhs or dvd. It doesn't matter."
3,A short and general introduction to the topic,"This book is nicely designed and has some interesting examples in it. It may be useful to those looking for some possible applications of QTVR, but the book is very light on the ""how to"" aspect of the software itself. If you're expecting in-depth coverage of Apple's QTVR Authoring Studio software, you will probably be disapointed. On the other hand, there are few (if any) other books available about QTVR, so in that regard, this book is worth having for what information it does provide."
1,Don't be fooled by this book,"This book is a travesty in many respects. While some of the conclusions were warranted, most (including the overall points) were based on faulty analyses by an academic who had no training in the area upon which he expounds. Indeed, much of the ""research"" was performed by similarly untrained students. Numerous factual errors were manifest in the book in scientific and regulatory areas. A very biased look at issues that need a more sober approach."
4,Performance,Hoya produces good clear filters. I have been satisfied with the quality and durability of all Hoya filters used to date.
5,Nice club skirt !!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Very good quality cotton, more beautifull when you wear it .You are going to like wearing on. Just to go out at saturday night . Everybody look at you !!!!!"
3,Locker decorating,"This book gives clever ideas for decorating your locker but doesn't give the actual supplies for doing it, aside from several sheets of magnetic peel and stick pages. I love Klutz products, have never been disapointed but this fell a little short and my daughter was somewhat let down."
2,For beginners only!,"This is a very easy workout and I would recommend it for beginners only. It did help using leg and arm weights, but it's very boring and the music stinks."
4,Nice stories,"The movie was made back in the '80, no wide screen picture. The presentations are nice, with useful information and even jokes. Too bad about the picture."
4,Nice,"I must admit that I originally bought this CD for the song ""Voices"" which I've been wanting. After listening to the whole thing, I can say that there are many good tracks here. At times you feel a sense of classic Journey, other times you get a hint of Foreigner or Asia. Very diversified with even a Spanish guitar solo on one track. A good purchase for those interested in late 70's/early 80's rock."
1,One Good Song,Sorry but it is the worst (or at least the second worst) CD I have ever purchased. Even tho it was cheap -- still not worth the money.
5,Megaman V Classic Gameboy,I got Megaman V for my friends birthday and he is loving it.I waited a year to get the best price for him.
4,"Timely, well-written, and chilling.","In light of the 12 year old Ohio boy who'd recently held his classmates and teacher at gunpoint with a fully ,oaded 9 mm semiautomatic, this book almost seems like a prophecy. Kennett has written an engrossing, ultimately terrifying story that bids fair to re-sharpen the blunted sensibilities of we who have been treated to an almost weekly dose of school vilence.CHAMELEON is a disturbing book that, while it doesn't even begin to promise a solution to schoolyard violence, stills presents a chilling, well-written account of the consequences of parents and teachers not reading the signs."
5,Shirley Kennett writes again!,"3rd fantastic book in a row! Don't miss her 4th in the series written under the name of Avery Morgan titled Act of Betrayal! Also, check out her Web site for more about Kennett."
3,It was alright.,"I've read some of Shirley Kennett's other works, and found them enjoyable, but I really had to suspend some disbelief for Chameleon. Two grown adults go up against a 12-year-old child and almost don't take him down? I've seen the same plot except the killer was an older adult, more plausable for thwarting police. It was still a good read, but I didn't really go for the child-as-a-killer plot. Might have worked well with an adult, and the killer certainly did have the proper childhood to become a killer later on in life. But at his age, it just didn't gel with me.I'm not saying don't read it, because it's not bad. Suspend your skepticism and go for it."
2,I Almost Didn't Bother To Finish This!,"Even though PJ Gray describes herself as ""fiercely protective"" of her son, she leaves him alone in the house at night with someone she's sure is a psychotic killer because ""so far Columbus has only killed adults."" So that's okay, I guess. Columbus manages to murder someone by starting a rumor that the person is a drug runner: He starts the rumor, then sits back knowing, somehow, that car-jackers are bound to attack and kill that person; he even somehow knows what night this will happen. I think there were a couple pages of explanation missing here. I got the feeling at times that during editing big blocks of information or background got cut out. Sorry to be so negative! I did like the characters of PJ and Schultz. I liked the way PJ bluntly acknowledges to herself that she wouldn't mind getting some sex. She's no priss. However, I was getting so fed up with the plot holes that I had to force myself to finish it."
1,Sucks,"I could not rate this any lower, ordered this DVD and received it promptly. When I attempted to play it my player kept telling me no disk. I have tried it on various machines with the same results. I can only say that I was sold a blank disk. Save your money"
3,"Good price, medium quaality","This is a goog Finger Goniometer, but the quality could be better... but for the price, it's a good buy. Shipping o.k."
1,"Wow. This is really, really BAD.","This book can be summarized in about 3 sentences: 1. Don't be egocentric. 2. Don't be mean. 3. Don't be dumb.I'm very sorry I wasted the money on this, and even more sorry that some of the money will go to Ben Stein."
2,Not so good for Mojitos,"Pros: Great Rosle construction, great looks, and the plastic end that comes in contact with the fruit has a diamond cut pattern that helps grip the limes...a feature I now look for in my muddlers, as it really aids in extracting the oils and juices from the fruit.Cons: It's about 3 inches too short. Even in a small 8 oz. shaker tin, I have to be cautious not to scrape my nuckles on the edge of the tin. Forget about using it in a standard 16 oz. shaker tin. So if you only do your muddling in a small rocks glass, then this is a good choice."
5,Great Product,"When I building my bar, I wanted quality prducts. When I saw this muddler, I knew I had to have it. Who wants wood when you can get stainless steel and nylon? Besides, this is dishwasher safe.This tool fits nicely in my hand. It does a good job of bruising and crushing ingredients inside the glass. It works well in my tall and old fashioned glases; I like it better in the shorter glasses because it's easier to maneuver. I highly recommend this to all my fellow mojito lovers!"
2,FYI Made in China,"Pretty pricey considering it's MADE IN CHINA. I was under the impression that Rosle products are German made, thus justifying the premium price; NOT SO. Comparable (imho) products (Swissmar) are 1/3 the price."
5,Excellent '60's Laine retrospective.,"Almost everything's here from Frankie Laine's mid-60's ABC/Paramount recordings. You'll find yourself singing along with song after song. If I had one wish though it would have been the inclusion of ""Every Street's A Boulevard (In Old New York)"" a true Laine classic recording nearly impossible to locate. It would be difficult to find a better representation of American pop vocalist during the British music invasion than this Frankie Laine collection."
2,Muzzle for dogs - poor,"I am a dog groomer of 12 years. Unfortunately, I found this muzzle not to work well. The leather stretches and looses shape and leaves way too much room for the dog's mouth to open. Dog would surely still be able to bite you, even while wearing this muzzle.Disappointing."
4,Great film for a variety of conditions,This is a good all-purpose film for the amateur photographer. I've been very pleased with the results in most areas; a little lacking in low-light situations but I may be lacking in photographic skills. Can be developed anywhere.
2,"low contrast, dark colors.","strongly disliked this film. blues and greens came out ok. skin tones and reds came out very dark. not terrible, but i was disappointed to say the least."
5,KEEP FILM ALIVE!,"I have used this film in my new(!) F100 Nikon with a good 24MM AF lens.I am very impressed with the range, depth and color rendition.I shot some extreme colors, California poppies, iceplant, and gold spray paint graffiti. Incredible color accuracy and resolution. Lens quality all the more important with this film. I had Ritz scan the images at 1.5 MB average per image, very good. I will now try higher res scans of ~10 MB but expect good results.Top rated."
2,Please retire Him,"I have been a loyal house head for over 15 years and for the first time since Richard has pumped out intense mixes, this is the first time I am dissapointed. It sounds more like electro-pop-rock-digital boring crap. I didnt bob my head or feel like dancing. Is he even trying anymore. If his next album is this bad he will be cutt of from being in my vinyl and cd collection."
5,The Radio is off now. Welcome into our house!,"Wow - are you kidding me. This album is insane. Some great mixes and beats.Its just absolutely amazing.You have to love ""Rock'n'ROll"". I mean. I can listen to that one till my ears bleed.This is the sound of a revolution...(pause)This is the sound of a revolution...(pause)This is the sound of ROCK 'n ROLL!!!OMG I love it!"
2,hmph...,"I have enjoyed Richard's mixes for a long time now. I didn't really enjoy this one.The track selection is pretty lame. Gone are the days of thumping, pounding, make you wanna get off of the couch or dance in the car tracks. This is pretty run of the mill house with some funky beats. The selection is weak, and at times, the mix doesn't seem to flow seamlessly. Trancy-type tracks are thrown in the middle of the set and throw off whatever vibe he was trying to create.I put down the DJ Dan double cd for this one. I'm regretting this decision.If you want a cd that is remiscent of Richard's style, buy his old albums and stay away from this one!"
2,Bummer dude,"I have been buying Richard since I first heard of him post ""Jump"" days... I was a little dissapointed with this album. Some really nice singles on it, but if you like Damn that DJ and expect something to back it up (assuming you didn't buy Big Floor Funk) this won't deliver."
4,While the Banshee Cried,"I found the book,""While the Banshee Cried"" to be a very compelling read. Very hard to put down once you start. The author weaves fiction around facts and little known details of era. It details the fortunes and misfortunes of an immigrant Irish family during our Civil War - while following the Irish Brigade's conception and development.I highly recommend this for any civil war buff or those looking for a great read!"
3,An Adequate Account?,"Barely an adequate account. John Killen's book is obviously written by an admirer of of the RFC and the RAF. For me, this came across more strongly than the stated objective of a history of the German airforces of WW1 and WW2. The title is misleading in that it is very much an account of the air conflict in European skies during WW1 and WW2, though barely an history of the Luftwaffe."
2,some 40 year old books simply are not worth reprinting...,"..exhaustive ..?! sorry, I would have chosen adjectives like skimpy, patchy, incomplete, superficial. A forty year old text that didn't merit a nice reprint like this...I could have done better from memory .."

1,Was not what I expected,"I sent it back, I watched it for five minutes, didn;t like what I saw. Can't compete with Ken Burns. I was looking for more of a documentry type tape."
4,The very best Lou Monte,"The very best of Lou Monte is great, I grew up in a Italian family and I remember hearing a lot of his songs,brings back a lot of memories"
1,The very best of Lou Monte,I had ordered a few tapes which were fine. However this one was shipped and received w/ a broken plastic jacket....
4,funny guy,This is my standard music recording review. Just because they ask for 20 words.This is a good recording and enjoyable to listen too. It is worth buying this item. See my star rating for how much I enjoyed it.
3,Inner Seal Leaking...,"One washing and inner seal has filled with water/moisture on two of our tumblers... Expected better quality... they are a nice ""look"" but may want to find a more reliable manufacterer..."
3,INSULATED GLASSES,I like these type glasses that keep the condensation off tables when the weather is warm. I wish the glasses were a little narrower so they were easier to hold for small hands or hands with arthritis.
4,"For Flavored Condoms, these taste pretty good","Of the three flavors in here (Vanilla, Bannana and Strawberry) I like Vanilla the best. I've used them for oral sex and vaginal sex, never broken on me either. They could taste better, but for flavored they taste damn good."
5,This is my fave Morrissey CD....,"I have owned this album for approximately two years now and it's one of my most treasured albums from my entire collection. When I first purchased it the songs took getting used to, but after a couple of listens I was completely hooked. This album has a great mix of upbeat music with ""piccadilly palare"" and ""suedehead"" and beautiful, meaningful slow songs like ""yes, I am blind"" and ""he knows I'd love to see him"". This music is not only meaningful, but the lyrics are brilliantly written.A lot of people complain that Morrissey could never be as good as the Smiths, I actually feel that Morrissey is just as good as the Smiths, if not better. Since I've purchased this album I've been listening to it more than I listen to all my Smiths Albums. So for all you skeptical Smiths fans, don't let you love and devotion for the Smiths deter you from purchasing this amazing album."
4,post-Smiths Morrissey strikes again,"""Bona Drag"" is simply a singles album, as stated in the reviews above. For some odd reason, ""Quija Board, Quija Board"" was released as a single, and it's the sole reason the album does not recieve five stars. Okay, I lied. This album does not recieve five stars because of it's inability to pull me into every song as the Smiths and later Morrissey albums do. Don't get me wrong, it's still genius.My three favorite tracks:""November Spawned a Monster""""Suedehead""""Disappointed"""
5,Another phenomenal compilation,"In his grand tradition of releasing song after perfect song in the form of compilation discs, Morrissey once again hits the proverbial nail right on the head with Bona Drag. Beginning with the melodic Picadilly Palare, Bona Drag manages to do what most albums dream of: maintain tremendously well-crafted songs from start to finish. Familiar gems such as Hairdresser on Fire and Everyday is Like Sunday are matched by equally intelligent, though lesser known, companions such as Lucky Lisp and Will Never Marry. A very enjoyable disc indeed."
5,yes I am blind,"Why did I need the thoughts and sentiments of my amazonian friends to convince me? Because 'I' was there... I felt blessed w/ a debut album, which was more than anyone could have anticipated or hoped for (Viva Hate): But then - what is this - Three singles and the B-sides that I've already bought + the singles from the debut. No, No, No - I want brillent new material that I've previously not been exposed to. But, the majority say shut up and listen - so maybe that's what I'm forgetting to do. ""...and in my sorry way I loved you"" - WELL is there any other way to love - dose ANYONE else even try to speak the truth...?"
3,Get a new Oija board!,"This album is really a series of singles. I like that. Each strack is strong, independant, and vibrant. With so many concept albulms, it is nicve to hear this type of anthlogy. It remidns me of reading a collection fo short sotries. Each one is a mini-symphomy.However, the parts do not exceed the whole. This album is vibrant in parts, but not as an organism. Like the saying goes, ""Penny wise, but pound foolish.""I think the symbol of this album's problem is the Ouija Board song. What is that about? I personaly do not use one to get dates, and certaibnly do not recommend it to anyone for anything.It is a meatphore? What point is trying to be made. Even the Beach Boys on ""Smiley Smile"" did not get as werid as this one song. Musically, it is fine, but the subject matter belongs more to Ozzy."
4,Bona Drag,I choose this cd because I want have every cds of Morrissey in Studio and because the low price. I received the product in time and it's ok.
4,"Still no charger hole but,,!","Better than the logo'd one I got at the Cingular store. Best feature, other than it is soft and supple is the magnetic cover as opposed to the snap on the cingular sold version. Also, V3 doesn't go crazy beeping when you drop the phone in ( again, unlike the one with the Cingular logo )Also slides on your belt easir than ( again ) the other one!"
2,Worked for exactly 1 year,"Got this last August. It felt nice and sturdy... Or so I thought. The other day it got worn out and the clip detached from the main unit, and its near impossible to reattach it(especially when its worn down). I got lucky it fell of in the car, and not in the amusement park 10 minutes earlier."
3,OK for occasional use,"I'm on my second one of these. I wear it on my belt a few hours a day and on weekends, otherwise it stays in my laptop bag. About two months in, the first's clip came apart from the case and stayed on my belt while I was taking it off... but to be fair I wear my belts kind of tight.For $5, it's a nice little case for a Razr, but I wouldn't work construction with it."
5,Perfect,"I was glad that I ordered this Leather Pouch, because even though onecame with my phone this is a much nicer case."
5,good item,"the pouch works great, I bought a total of 3 and gave some to my friends and they love them."
1,My Dolce & Gabbana phone had problems after using this pouch,"Hi All,I got D&G; phone as a gift from India. I bought this holder and a bluetooth headset from Amazon. The phone was working fine for past few months and also worked ok after I used the holder for some time. But lately since past few weeks, the phone was going out of service mode or ""Insert SIM"" mode all of a sudden. This happened every single day since a week or so.I stopped using this leather holder (after visiting Cingular and finding that they can't help resolve my issue with the phone) and now since couple of days the phone fine. I am thinking that the magnets in the leather pouch is causing some interference with the phone.Also, I didn't like the holder that much anyway, as it's belt holder is too stiff and doesn't slide smoothly on to the belt.My 2 cents.Thanks."
3,"Stylish, but hard clip","This is a great case in many respects, but not perfect. A Razr fits nicely and the magnetic cover is both stylish and easy to use. The clip is a very rigid piece of metal that doesn't have much spring in it. This makes it hard to attach to thicker belts or the waist of some pants and shorts. I'm happy with it overall, but the clip is hard to use."
1,Junk,Total Junk! I purchased two of these for my Razr in June. One for work and one for good. Sept 5th and both pouches are now broke. The belt clips have torn loose from the pouchs. Luckly I was able to find my phone both times.
2,Did even last 24 hours,"I had to return this, the clip fell of on my first day of use, dropping my cell phone and the rest of the case on the ground."
3,Not a good buy,I rate it low because it makes it way to difficult to get the phone out of the case which leads to a lot of missed calls. Otherwise its good quality. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Look for a Vertical pouch instead.
5,Don't know how it could be better...,"This pouch is awesome... it fits my Samsung A-900 perfectly and I don't have to worry about it falling of my waistband or belt. I also don't have to worry about my phone falling out, or it getting opened accidentally, since the two magnets that keep it closed are plenty strong."
3,Pouch,"I would rate this for a pouch more so than a phone case. Usually I like to have my phone in a case that protects it, yet leaves it easy to make or answer the phone. With this pouch, it is protected, however you have to take it out of the case to make a call. That is the only downside of it.The strap that keeps this phone in, is made really well. With a magnetic force that keeps the phone in snug. I would get another one like this. It may just not be what I was looking for, but it was definatly a good surprise."
2,This product is not worth a peny!!,It look cute at the begining but less than 2 months later it all falls apart. It was a very bad experience.
5,Great Case,"Great quality, I realy like the horizontal profile. Better made than some I have paid twice as much for. Great buy."
1,Premium Leather Pouch for the Razr,I did not like it at all. This pouch is not suited for the Razr because of the location of the buttons on the phone. Putting the phone in and out of the pouch has become an agrivating struggle. It is to the point where I won't use it. They make a simlar pouch for the model prior to the Razr and it works much better. I would not buy that one instead.
5,leather case,I bought this for my razor but use it for my nano ipod and it has great magnet closing and works great
4,Perfectly Fine,What is there to say about a $10 black leather case. It fits my Samsung T809 perfectly and the case seems very well made. It is a snug fit but the phone is easilly removed by pushing it out from the hole in the bottom of the case. The magnetic closure is secure and the case does a good job of protecting the phone. If you want a leather case that looks more expensive... buy a more expensive case.
1,Do Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807,"For Samsung D807 users: In my opinion, you shall not think of buying this pouch as this pouch is not meant for D807. It is wrongly advertised over here. I also request amazon not to advertise this pouch for D807.I bought this pouch few days back for my Samsung D807 cingular. When I received it, I tried my D807. First of all, it was difficult to put the phone inside it. And secondly, it was more difficult to remove the phone out of pouch. Think of situation when your phone is ringing and you are not able to take it out from the pouch :-(Additionally, this pouch is difficult to fit in men's belt, as it's clip is too tight. I expected to have slot for belt instead of a clip.Finally, I had to return the pouch to amazon.com."
1,Not good for Samsung T809,I ordered this case after reading the good reviews. But I am very disappointed because my T809 does not fit in it. I have to put lot of efforts to push the phone in and out. What's the use if it is going to take more than a minute to take out the phone when you need to answer the call. obviusly the call will be missed. It may be good for RAZR V3 (as the box says) but certailnly not for T809. They should not advertize it for Samsung T809.
1,Not a good case for Samsung D807,"I ordered this case to go with the Samsung D807 phone I recently purchased, but was disappointed. It fits very snugly - as in you have to exert some effort to get the phone in the case. In the process of putting the phone in, the phone often gets turned back on because that's how tight of a fit it is. Maybe this case is good for Razr V3 but they should not advertise it for D807 as it is a very poor case for this phone. Although the D807 maybe should have a better key locking mechanism, it's ridiculous that, by pushing the phone into the case (and pushing kind of hard), the phone should get turned back on..."
1,Unsatisfied!,"This case was cheap in price. Unfortunately it also looks cheap and feels cheap. I can not recommend that you purchase this item unless you want your sharp looking RAZR to have a real flea market look about it. Poor leather. Poor workmanship. Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look. Mine went straight in the closet. MONACO makes a much better looking case that is much more functional, and they are available on eBay for about the same price."
3,Good buy...,"When I first got the case, I was a little worried that my LG CU500 would not fit. I put it in the pouch and literally had to force it. I was a little upset, but after I finished stretching it and taking the phone in and out, it eventually stretched out and accommodates my phone with no problem. I love my leather pouch. The only small downside is the tight clip on the back. Sometimes it is hard to get off my belt but i guess that's good so that your phone won't ever slip off. Definitely recommend this to everyone who has a razor."
1,I would hate to see what the non-premium pouch is like,"Its what you get for these odd made in China phone cases. Granted the ones you buy from your carriers store (AT&T;, Verizon, Sprint) are also made in China, they are far better... and cost much more. But the case that I got was not the one pictured or fit the description given. So beware!I was looking for a case with a wide belt clip (narrow clips don't hold when I bump something or get in and out of the car) and a good fit for the RAZR V3. The case I got has a narrow clip and too large for the RAZR so the phone flopped around."
3,Doesn't quite fit my Razor.,"The case is a bit large all the way around. Ten more tiny words are required, so here they are."
3,Not what I ordered,"The case pictured here is not the case that I received, but I am still using the flimsier looking one. What I liked about this one shown was the outside stitching, and it looked like a very sturdy case or pouch, the one I received was very soft, but does the job so I've kept it. But who ever handles your inventory should be a little more careful about what they are sending out."
1,Useless for a Motorola RAZR V3,"The pouch I received looks nothing like the picture. It's about 1/4"" wider than the V3 thickness and 3/4"" longer than the V3 length. When I reported this to BlueMall, they replied immediately and gave me a full refund. For great customer service, I give BlueMall 5 stars, but this product deserves less than 1. I'm not sure why it's still on the Amazon Web site unless they're selling something different than what I received."
2,Does Not Fit RAZR - To Tight,"I found that this is too small for the RAZR V3, whenever you place your phone in the holder, it pushes the side buttons, and if you did not program your phone otherwise, it will call the last person you talked to and they will get to here all of your conversations. I am sure there is a better holder out there, I have just not found it yet."
2,Metal Clip Not Strong Enough,"When I got this case, Initially the phone was difficult to remove. Shortly, however, the material softened and it worked just fine. The problems with this began three weeks ago when sitting down in an airline seat, apparently the arm of the seat pushed it off my belt. Luckily the flight attendent found it and returned it to me. Two days later, a similar event happened in a taxi. Again, I was lucky and the next rider was able to contact me and return the phone to me. After this last event, I inspected the case and found that the belt clip had bent out, making it useless. Threw it away. I urge caution for anyone considering this case. Other than the clip, other materials are of good quality."
1,Terrible quality,Bought this for my wife's Motorola Razor phone. The belt clip separated from the pouch after two uses. The clip is attached to the pouch only with glue - the supidest construction idea. Returned to Amazon and got my refund. These types of products should not even be sold. The pictures are very deceiving. I would have given it a negative rating if allowed.
2,Good case - Bad Belt Clip,"Like several other reviewers here, I think this is a very nice case, but after 2 weeks the belt clip tore loose. The clip is very poorly made and attached in a very flimsy manner. Therefore, I recommend that you do not buy this item."
3,"Nice, inexpensive, but not durable","The case fits the RAZR perfectly and offers good protection. The belt clip was very tight and difficult to get on and off my belt or to adjust to a comfortable position when getting into my vehicle. The clip eventually tore loose from the case. It appears it is only glued in place and the strain of everyday wear was too much for it. A loose loop would have worked much better than the tight spring steel clip. Fortunately, the case protected the phone from damage when the clip gave way."
2,Didn't last long,"I bought this pouch for a RAZR and was pleased upon arrival. The fit was nice for the phone and seemed sturdy enough. But the belt clip in the back was very tight and I had trouble fitting the case over my belt. Within two months the clip had torn away from the pouch and was unusable for my needs. Thought I had a great price too, but found one very similar at a large discount store locally for the even less money."
2,A version of Battleship,All this game is basically is a version of Battleship that was desgined by Ninendo. It is alright for a quick waste of an hour or two. The other game included with this is a game where you are in command of a sub and trying the sink the enemy's fleet or other sub. Again a way to waste an hour or two. Not much beyond that.
1,Didn't work out for me,"I ended up reselling this on Amazon Marketplace for a loss. Maybe it's just me, but I couldn't get this to work properly, so I went back to the crimping style which always works.Paladin is a quailty company, so maybe I just wasn't doing something correctly."
1,Where are the unreleased episodes?,"Anyone who has the 3 box sets knows this one is a waste of time. All the episodes here are on those other sets.That being said, where are the episodes that are NOT on those three sets? Classics such as Way Down Mexico Way (parts I & II) and Stewart's House (the infamous episode that got the show in trouble). I'd pay good money to see THOSE episodes in a box set. And more music videos, like the Overkill one with the flying skull.I guess this is a good set for casuals, though."
1,buyer beware nothing new,"just a heads up, all these episodes are available on the collections mostly vol 2. There is NOTHING new here.I would like to see Tornado, Way Down Mexico Way parts 1 and 2,Stewarts house etc. released on dvd and blu ray. Mike Judge should really smarten up, us fans are the ones that buy the products. Who cares what episodes he thinks are good? We want Every episode uncut."
3,I enjoyed it!,"Yes, I confess, I love these guys! So, even though, I already had the 3 volume set, being a collector any chance I can get of Beavis & Butt-Head, I had to have this. Having all 3 parts of ""Taint Of Greatness"" together for the first time, was a treat. Seeing key points of ""Holy Cornholio"" was, uh, like awesome or sumthin.' Uh, huh, huh, huh."
5,All Laughs,I love Beavis and Butthead and this DVD has some of the best! Nosebleed is always funny. This is definitely something I was happy to add to my collection!
4,A definite page turner,"While reading this book I found myself unable to put it down. The characters were well defined and when I finished I wanted to find out more-what happened after the last page. Ms. Orloff's style of writing is very conversational and allows you to feel as if you become part of the characterhs lives. Overall, I truly enjoyed this book."
5,Hello Freud,"This is not a children's book, nor is it for family-abuse survivors. This is an autobiographical therapeutical photomontage which is deeply disturbing. A must-read for all those who wish to understand why and why people punish children through deep psychological manipulation, and how children use art to recover from their families."
4,works as mentioned.,"Installed it into windows (glass) and a metallic door. Worked fine.On the metallic door didn't use the template, just cut hole for the door, and drill for the two bolts.Only wish it could be thinner. :-)"
5,Works perfectly,"This is a Neutral Clear lens designed for keeping your lens intact.Most people should know that DSLR lens have a protective coating which wears away slightly every time you clean the lens. As such, most people usually buy a UV filter to cover the lens.This lens is as clear as invisible. I place it on a sheet of white paper and see no discolorations at all. If there wasn't a black ring and simply the glass, I'm pretty sure I wouldn't notice it.I recommend this for everyone who's looking to protect their lens. Lens are more expensive than camera bodies most of the time, so preserving them would be in the best interest of anyone who is interested in doing photography with DSLR cameras.I've purchased this in 52mm and 67mm, and both are very much crystal clear, multi-coated. If you don't want a UV filter, you can get this one instead."
3,Green lens flare artifacts from light sources,"I bought this instead of the much less expensive Tiffen filter because of the great review of this product and the poor reviews of the Tiffen filter complaining of green artifacts from light sources.I am pleased with the quality of the filter. It even comes with a nice hard plastic protective case for storage when not in use. I became disappointed when I began taking some test shots with the new filter on. I could immediately see green lens flare artifacts in about 50% of the photos I was taking that included a bright point light source.If the picture includes a lighting fixture, lamp pole, car headlight, etc, in my experience there is about a 50% chance of the picture being compromised with annoying green artifacts. I am disappointed because I intentionally paid more for this filter with the expectation it would be free from this effect. I'll probably return the filter and shoot with the lens naked and just be careful."
5,Arrived exactly as expected!,Clear filter was purchased as protection for a new 50mm 1.8 AF-D Nikon lens. Arrived ontime and in perfect condition!
5,STURDY & RELIABLE,"I chose this over the Best Buy ""NO NAME"" brands.BEST CHOICE EVER!The quality of this filter is much better than the ROCKET FISH filters.Recommended For Sure!"
5,Expect nothing less then perfect quality from Nikon.,"Expect nothing less then perfect quality from Nikon. Just like most people, I use a UV filter as a lens protector. This was a perfect first defense add on for my Nikon Lens. The filter has no imperfections and is made with precision quality."
5,Exactly what it says,"We bought this filter to protect the kit lens for the Nikon D3100. So far, it's been great - hasn't affected our photo quality at all, fits perfectly (we leave it on all the time), and does exactly what it says - protects."
5,Essential Accessory,If you sometimes bump or mishandle your lens this is a great way to minimize possible damage.
5,Get Assertive!,"If found the sections on increasing your self-confidence to be invaluable. There are many, many pieces of advice in this section that hadn't occurred to me before. What a concept - to be able to increase your self-confidence. I really thought that people were pretty much born with it our without it. This book convinced me otherwise."
2,Weak Tea,"Jeff Davidson is the author of more than a dozen self-help books, and frankly, it shows. This book is a bit of a hack job, with enough real substance for a magazine article, not a book.The book is marred by dozens of errors, which detract from the author's credibility.(""Martin Luther King, Jr. delivered his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech but, of equal note, endured many years in jail and discrimination for what he believed in"" [p35]. Incorrect. Over the course of his life, King spent perhaps several months in jail, most famously for eleven days in 1963, when he wrote Letter from Birmingham Jail.""Mozart's music was considered too innovative and too radical for its day; whereas his rival, Solare, was hailed as an accomplished composer"" [p40]. Incorrect. The author must mean Mozart's rival Antonio Salieri. The Argentian composer Juan Maria Solare was born about 70 years after Mozart died.)"
1,Disappointing!!,"From all the reviews i thought this book would be helpful, but i was overly disappointed. The author mostly talked about what assertiveness is and isn't, which i already know. There were very few suggestions on how to actually become an assertive person. And i could have done without reading about the author's 6'3"" athletic build 3 different times. He listed a bunch of organizations that you could join to help build public speaking skills, but a phone directory could have told me that. I found no useful hints. He threw in statements that one could use when needing to be assertive, but they were so archaic that even my grandmother would laugh at me if i used them (""i don't mean to tip the apple cart...""). Utterly disappointing."
3,Plus and minus.,"This book is about twice as long as it needs to be. The biggest plus is aquiring perspective. The minus is too much arbitrary filler. Like any presentation of this type, it is only an outline. The user must fill in the blanks."
3,Thorough read,"As Mr. McGivern stated in an earlier comment, this book is a little heavy for the casual reader. However, if the reader is able to plow through the multitude of dates and names, he/she will have a good understanding of what transpired and why."
3,the IRA,"If you are looking to seriously educate yourself on the topic, this is a must read. Coogan has done his research and shows off every single bit of it. This book will chronical the IRA in it's entire entirity, every bit of it beginning to end, up and down and sideways. If you are board reading my review already, don't bother with this book. The details are amazing, and the characters too numerous to count. The author jumps characters often, and unless you really study this book you will more than likely be lost."
1,Extemely biased!!,I read this book many years ago. It is incredibly one-sided. Reading this book is akin to reading a book about the vietnam war by HO chi minh! The book romanticises the IRA and demonises the Brits and unionists. According to Coogan the bad guys in relation to the warrington bomb were the british not the IRA. Avoid like the plague!
3,Biased,"I enjoyed the book and its detailed treatment of the events and history of the IRA....However, am I the only reader to offended by the way in which Coogan would describe for example, the death of an IRA man whose own bomb blew up in his face as a tragic event, yet would seemingly gloss over events like the Birmingham Pub Bombings, were many innocent civilians lost their lives?"
5,Try not. Buy. Or buy not,"This is by far one of the best Yodas made to date. Much more paint detail then the Attack of the Clones line. This figure has a lot of fun poses with his ball jointed neck, articulated wrists and elbows. Have yoda move an x wing or just have him stand there training luke. The only downside to this figure is he can't sit like most of his other figures. But there's a good reason. He detatch's at the waist to fit in a backpack for the dagobah luke.Overall a great looking figure. Beats the Vintage one by far."
1,"""How they get so rich making toys of this kind?""","I am a HUGE Yoda fan and I have a collection of many different Yoda figures and other character items, but I couldn't disagree more with the first reviewer: I think this is one of the ugliest Yoda figures I've ever seen! I much prefer the vintage Yoda, and even some of the more recent ESB and AOTC figures to this newest model. The eyes are all wrong, and the color looks ""off"". He doesn't even look like the photo on the packaging! You want some really cool Yodas? Find the Hallmark ornaments that have come out in the past few years. I will not be purchasing this new action figure."
4,"Visually stunning, beautifully acted","I will admit I am a huge fan of Altman, but I love this film on its own. Visually it is stunning: the photograhy and lighting are a wonder. The film itself is like a canvas for some beautiful art. The perfomances are excellent - watching the love and great conflict between the brothers is riveting. This is one of Altman's unsung gems. Highly recommended."
4,Realistic portrait,"This movie about Vincent and Theo gives a more realistic account of the artist life. Also shows the difficult and often antagonistic relationship between the brothers. It coudn't be any other way, Theo economically supported his brother while the world couldn't recognize his amazing style. I enjoyed every minute of the movie, if you want to know more about Vincent, this movie is a must see."
3,The Painter Story-Tale,"A story of two Vincent brothers is interesting for not much knowing the issue especially.Vincent, an older one, was a mentally-disturbed painter while a younger offspring late Theo, an art dealer selling his brother's works, suffered from syphilis.Probably, such a historic drama could usually be presented with a great degree of producers' imagination-their personal vision of the data historical, of which ear-catting is, as proven recently, a deed of despair same gender attracted Vincent was involved in, not a self-mutilation during a mind-blackout.From this viewpoint, all surrounding the affair between a painter and a prostitute-cum-model is not so dramatically-substantial for erection-affected Vincent as a movie attempted stressing on.Two hour screening is too long anyway."
1,Altman's Worst,"It seems all the reviewers of this film are big fans of Van Gogh, and who isn't? But it remains a bizarre shame that Robert and Vincent didn't mix well at all. Between a silly script, mediocre acting and absolutely dull photography, this picture is one that neither could sell."
1,Aimless,"This movie is highly overrated. The only real drama occurs at the very beginning when one of the Sunflower paintings is being auctioned at Christie's in London. It is downhill after that.LUST FOR LIFE is an old movie but at least there are competent actors, there is character development and it is visually interesting."
1,2 came ordered one,I ordered one got two and was charged for two - keep it for a giftTook over 2 week to get it- them
4,Five Pennies featuring Jimmy Dorsey and Pee Wee Russel,"This CD fits my favourite of the jazz at 1920 to 1940th, but unfortunately, the part of Pee Wee Russel were too short. Now I am purchasing next CD of Rassel."
1,Maybe good for business aliens,This book has no insight and the content is obvious. Seems like a collection of easy to read magazine business articles. May be interesting for people looking for an introduction to marketing.
2,Nothing new,"Quite disappointed. Nothing new. Recommend ""How customers think"" and ""clued in"" instead of this one."
5,Love this salt,"I used to buy this salt locally for years and years and then it just disappeared. On a whim, I checked Amazon and, of course, there it was. It is just the best salt mixture...quite unique. I use it on everything but the very best is on a fresh sliced tomato. Wonderful!"
2,flimsy jewellery,"I had ordered this chain 5 months ago (Dec 06, and already heavily discounted)It came in and I shipped it right back. It was so flimsy and light that I didn't want to wear it, it looked very cheap. The links between the stones are paper thin, and what looks ""hammered"" on the photos is just well photographed.At least with Amazon, you get your money back.."
3,5 Star Designs with 2 Star Instructions,"This book has lovely arty pictures of beautiful designs, but the photos are not always clear enough to make the design clear. The instructions are in the back of the book in tiny print and black and white graphs. In several cases the thread paths are hard to follow; in at least one diagram the arrows appear to show the thread running clockwise and counterclockwise simultaneously. An experienced beader could probably work the patterns out, and many of the designs would be well worth the effort."
2,"Pretty pictures, but otherwise disappointing","This book contains virtually nothing BUT pretty pictures. The captions for the pictures are minimalist, and there is no discussion at all of the considerations which went into the color selection and design of the pieces. If you are looking for ""inspiration"", this book may satisfy you. If you are looking for information, you will most likely be seriously disappointed."
4,Great book!,"This book has beautiful designs and ideas for your own jewelry creations. I have only tried one pattern so far, which was an easy one itself, with nice pictures to follow. The instructions can get a little confusing just by the way the designer states/words the directions. But overall I am satisfied with the book because I have the same taste in design."
5,"Fun, Elegant Designs","Sweet! Stuffed full of fun, elegant designs - amazing what's crammed into 80 pages. Inspiring photos, complete lists of materials and tools, clear diagrams. Some U.S. beaders unfamiliar with two-needle beadwork may find the diagrams confusing (a previous reviewer, for instance), but they're actually quite concise and thorough. A genuine little treasure trove of beautiful bead designs."
4,beautiful book......,"This is a great book for beaders to have, though I am a fan of all Japanese inspired designs. Being a seasoned beader, I did not have trouble following the patterns, but definitely not recommended if you are a beginner beader."
5,Fun and easy,This is another fun and easy to follow directions on learning how to make jewelry... try it you will love it too!
2,Great toy but broke quickly,I bought this for my 2 yr old and we loved it but it quickly broke- very flimsy- plastic bits snapped off and the dowels weren't glued in... too bad. Kind of expensive for a toy that doesn't last.
2,breaks easily,"I was disappointed in the quality of this toy after two minutes the propellor was broken. I would have expected it to be a bit more durable, if the propeller was wooden like I thought it was from the picture, I think it would improve the helicopters overall quality."
4,Blades kind of flimsy.,"My son loves this, it seems fairly well made. The only thing I would change would be to make the helicopter's blades a little sturdier. Every time we take it out of the toy box, they're bent into a new shape."
3,Okay but could be sturdier,"I bought this for my 3 year old son along with the plan toys parking garage. He loves the parking garage. He plays with the helicopter sometimes but I wouldn't say it is a big hit. Also, the propeller comes off pretty easily so I have had to find it and put it back on several times."
4,"Works great, hard to get items centered.","I love these frames! They look great and hang well.Con: Like most floating frames, it is incredibly hard to get an item centered.The result is well worth it though!"
5,great affordable frame high quality,"This frame was much better than expected. Very solid construction with the main frame, two panes of glass, and rear border paneling fitting snugly. Can accommodate either a floating document as it suggests, or even a matted print as I did. Really affordable and the only non-custom frame I could find in this size."
5,kherberth,"My son earned the rank of Eagle Scout and received a certificate from our State Representative. I wanted to display it, but not spend a fortune. The frame was perfect. Looks good, came well wrapped ,in perfect condition, and didn't break the budget."
5,These are the best frames!,I have purchased about 20 of these frames for our family photo gallary. These are great frames. Great quality!!
4,Looks great but...,"Bought this frame for my diploma, 11""x14"". It floats nicely in the frame and the simple black frame and double pane glass looks great.But the wood used is very light and does not hold itself straight. When hung in landscape, the weight of the glass caused the side with the hangers to bow revealing the the square frame backing.This is probably because of the inadequate amount of glue used to hold the front glass pane to the frame. The other 3 sides are held in strong, but the important side with the hangers did not have as much glue and the glass is not glued to the frame. A bit of superglue fixed that issue, but would have liked to have gotten a perfect frame in the first place.I think I just got a bad one, but overall a very nice frame for the price."
5,Great quality & price,"Very well constructed and aesthetic for the price. Be aware that the frame does not have solid backing; the contents are held between two panes of glass and unless the contents cover the entire interior, you will see behind the frame. Also, because of the glass sandwich design, matting may be problematic."
2,Broke as soon as I opened it,"It looked like a fine frame when I opened the package, but as soon as I tried to remove the back plate to put a picture in, the front glass pane broke."
1,"Terribble, not worth bothering","I bought this battery when my original one failed to hold a charge. This was almost useless as a replacement. It was good for about a month and now lasts for fewer than 10 pictures, without flash. Even my old Canon Lithium battery works better. Definitely look elsewhere."
2,"Extremely well written, but with a rambling plot and dislikable characters","This book was very disappointing. The actual writing style is really good, but the plot is meandering, has no conclusion, and there is basically zero character development, or in fact any characters of any interest at all."
4,Not Free SF Reader,"This is definitely a weird book, in the New Weird sense.A story about a gunslinger rebel officer of a defeated army, and a doctor acquaintance and fellow soldier of his.Wanted people, they decided to head for another country, and this involves a camel chase, of all things, with some sneakiness.Their new destination and home is a place financed by the slave trades, with competing gang lords vying for control. This is where our protagonist finds work, being really good at killing people.As well as your usual sordid gangland slayings, he becomes involved with a supernatural woman, and the revenant of a man his employer has wronged comes looking for them.A good, well-written book, although it sags a bit in the middle, so could have been a bit shorter.Almost a supernatural urban western, if considering the technology level and activity."
3,A little too slow for my taste,"I really wanted to like this book a lot with its strange and enticing main character and wonderful background story... But the plot was very slow in developing and I started to lose my concentration in some parts... However, I could not put the book down until I found out the conclusion of Gwynn's and Raule's lives (too bad that the ""good"" doctor played such a small role overall in this book after the stirring beginning)Overall, it was a good read (very well written) but pacing was off in some parts... Nonetheless, I would recommend this book heartily..."
2,Not as Advertised,"From Publisher's review ""Combine equal parts of Stephen King's Dark Tower series and China Mieville's Perdido Street Station, throw in a dash of Aubrey Beardsley and J.K. Huysmans, and you'll get some idea of this disturbing, decadent first novel from Australian author Bishop.""Wonder if they read Bishop's book? Stephen King has likely shredded better material and Mieville's characters, situations, and descriptions are far more vivid, engaging, and rich. Bishop has written a really good first novel, but it's not in the league of the authors listed above. I read several user reviews and allowed myself the benefit of the doubt, which cost me $15 or so. You pays your money and takes your chances.If this genre feeds part of your appetite, then my advice - go with other authors. Bishop offers nice appetizers, but the mains disappoint. Perhaps her second work will be better."
2,BORING!!!!!! and more of a western than a fantasy novel,"This book is boring. Yes the author writes well and uses an expansive vocabulary, but the story suffers. It is 400 pages long and it could have been only 50 pages. The character development could best be described as meandering and the author has each character speak withthe authors vocabulary. Every individual in this book uses very eloquent words to express themselves, that includes...ummm, everybody!!! Even drunken gangsters. If the author had not specified on each line who was speaking then one would never know the difference between the characters. The action is few and far between and I wish half as many words were used on describing the action as on the relationships and the characters philosophical whimsies. If I were a judge of a vocabulary aptitude test then I would rate this book very high. However the authors fails to entertain, enough said."
2,Hard to get through,"I began reading this book with high expectations, having seen so many great reviews on this site. The story begins well enough, and keeps the interest of the reader, but soon after it seems to become a lifeless excercise in how not to finish a story or keep the reader's attention. After a while, I didn't care what happened. I was bored. I've tried several times to finish the book, as I hate not finishing one after I begin it, but it's just plain hard! If you're looking for something to draw you in the way Mieville or Van derMeer can, I would suggest looking elsewhere."
2,Disappointing,"I read the blurbs from other writers, some I really enjoy, like Jeff Vandermeer, and was excited about this book. I was extremely disappointed. A lot of the writing is very good, but a lot of it is just terribly over-written. The opening was strong, with the two main characters fleeing across a desert, but once they reach the city of Ashamoil, things deteriorate. There is only really one sympathetic character, and I expected her to be the main character; she isn't. Instead, it's the other of the two from the opening. He is gradually revealed to be a vile person, and frankly, just not very interesting. There are echoes of China Mieville and Jeff Vandermeer and M. John Harrison...maybe even a little Fritz Leiber. But while I would love to visit cities like New Crobuzon or Ambergris or Viriconium or Lankhmar, I have no desire to visit (or revisit) Ashamoil, despite its vivid depiction."
4,24 Bit remasters are the best.,"Regardless of what music you like, the 24 Bit remastering available sounds brilliant. Especially on Jarre's albums."
5,GREAT CD,"The CD arrived within one day and the CD was everything it was advertised to be. GREAT songs, good music!"
5,Best Helmut Lotti CD Ever!,"This is his best by far. The first CD is strange to listen to only because I'm so used to the songs being sung by Dean Martin, Louis Armstrong and others. I have to say the second CD with his songs is my favorite. I can't stop listening to it, and it seems to end all too soon. A must have for any Helmut Lotti fan!"
3,Buyer Beware!!,"The monitor out jacks on this TV do not output audio signals when the video inputs are high quality (HDMI or component video). Therefore you must buy an additional audio receiver to use external speakers with this TV, if you want HDTV. This is not explained in their product literature, nor is it well known by their distributors. This info appears near the end of their trouble shooting guide, so beware this will be a shock if you're used to hooking up standard TVs."
5,A Real Gem - one of the best management books I read in years.,"Powerful Conversations is a perfect book for those with the drive to become a separate superb leader -- and not an average one.Wish I would have read this years ago, I have read at least five similar books but none of them even approached the model of conversation described here. I now see very clearly why organizations like Starbucks and GE have managed to maintain such a clear vision - this idea is pure genius!Highly recommend -- only for those with the drive to take this into practice. Not something average managers can use without hard work."
5,an easy way to get to know the eternal city...,"folks, this is the best idea for a tourbook/map that i have stumbled across yet. i'm not prone to raving, but this will garner praise from me until the cows come home (bearing foot & mouth) no doubt.so, why is this so great? first of all, it's simple and well designed. the city is broken down into sections. you turn to those pages and there is a brief description of places to eat, shop, etc. the pages then open up into a map of the section with a description of major sites in the area.brilliant! no fumbling around a big map trying to find your street. no squinting to figure out where you are. it's easy to find landmarks, metro stops, etc.the card stock is nice and heavy and has lasted well even in my back pocket. the descriptions have been helpful without being too lengthy. and at this price, it's quite competitive with other maps while providing much more."
5,Fantastic,One review above describes the second half of this album as weak. The second half is the best thing that Van has done other than Astral Weeks.The day I met my wife I played her the second half. It is still a religious experience.
5,Really Really INTO THE MUSIC . . . .,"From the start of BRIGHT SIDE OF THE ROAD to the climax of YOU KNOW WHAT THEIR WRITING ABOUT, Its all about LOVE baby love! When he's on his game this man speaks to the heart of life like no other. This is soul music that doesnt just come from a very deep place. He is in the music, like his own language. We who know are lucky enough to listen and be there too. Van is in the ZONE on this entire record, hard to ever find anything this good from anyone. My favorite artist of all time and this is his VERY BEST work! Wait did I just call it work? It cant be work making something this good. This is a JOY like Snoopy dancing on his dog house or being a child and waking up to find a snow day!!!!"
3,"If you like Van Morrison, you should own this album","Not his best, but the first five or six songs are worth the money. Like most Morrison albums, the last half somehow leaves something to be desired. But the first half of the album is well worth the money, making you wonder why you never wrote this stuff yourself..."
5,One of my favorites,"I own ten Van Morrison albums and this one gets the most play-time in my car, at home, at work. Whenever I need a pick-me-up."
5,A new beginning and the end of an era.,"What an excellent remaster. This was the Cd that came during a time of tranformation for Van. He was searching deeper into his spiritual ideals both personally and lyrically. He was finding changes in his voice and rising to the challenge. This is a classic Van Morrison CD. Also, one that has been underrated in the collective consciousness of his fans both casual and avid. The band is in top form and his gospel soul is pouring full on. I think this is a better CD than ""Wavelength"" from 1978. But, only a year later in 1980 with ""Common One"", His music had progressed even further. This is the bridge that linked those changes and it is a wonderful and fulfilling experience to listen to. The bridge from 1970's Into the Mystic from Moondance. To 1979's Into The Music."
5,Another soulful contribution,Van Morrison is one of the greats. Into the Music is another testament to his versatility. Another classic.
2,Liked it while it lasted!,"Only had this product for a little over one month. When we first received it, it had a little knock during operation which wasn't bad. After about one and a half months, the unit ground to a halt and quit working. This is why I gave it a poor rating.While it was working, my wife and I loved it and it performed as expected, even with that little knock. We bought the higher amp one so it would last longer but the motor was not the problem, something mechanical failed.We will shop around for another brand that will hopefully last for a very long time. Sent the unit back hoping to get a refund for it. We will see how this company handles refunds."
5,Jaclean USJ-106 (Made In Taiwan),"Purchased my Chi Vitalizer from eBay seller helpyougetinshape (California). Positioned the unit at the foot end of a talalay latex mattress on a 13""x34"" Masonite board (dimensions are not critical). The variable speed controller is very useful in this application since the best pulsations are at a mid-range setting. It does shut itself off after 15 minutes, and requires setting the controller dial to the off position to restart. The Chi unit is a nice supplement to other type massagers, but my personal preference priority would be a foot massager such as the Thumper Versa Pro (betterhealthinnovations.com may have used units)."
4,Love My Chi Energizer,I have Lymphedema in both legs. I had been told that the Chi would help stimulate the Lymph system. I use it twice a day - sometimes 3 times for no more than 20 minutes each time. I worked up to that from the 3 minutes each time the product recommended when you begin. (follow the instructions). It helps keep the swelling down in my feet. I have also noticed shapelier legs & bottom. If you do not lay completely straight out in front of the Chi I have noticed it gives me a backache or side ache. Again... follow the instructions. I have a very firm mattress so I put it at the bottom of my bed when in use then set it under when I am finished. I will keep using it and only time will tell the net result.
2,Bruised ankles no fun!,"I loved the idea of this product, but the reality is not so great. Even though the product description says the ankle rest is padded, it is certainly not SOFT padding. After only two uses, my ankles started to bruise and continued use only made it worse. I have now tried thick padded socks as well as bubble wrap to try to protect my ankles, but it is not enough. My next attempt will be to try to tape sponges to my ankles to cushion them. And this is on the lowest setting! If that doesn't work, I don't think I can continue to use this product, which would make it an expensive white elephant in my closet. What a shame!"
5,Chi Machine,I tried this product while on vacation. I was taking 6-12 ibubrofen a day for back pain. After 2 weeks of using this I haven't needed to take any.
5,Recommend the Chi for overall wellness,"I have hip joint pain from arthritis. I purchased the Chi Machine with the hope that it would help with hip joint pain, and it does. I feel like the movement helps to decompress the joint after a long day. I feel relaxed after using the Chi Machine, and I think it is helping me to manage my pain. An added bonus is that I have always wanted to start meditating for relaxation and stress relief, but I never seem to find the time. Now that I use the Chi Machine 15 min in the am and the pm, I turn down the lights, turn on soft music, and meditate while using the machine. It is awesome!"
4,A study in Independent Horror,"Three short stories made on a shoe-string budget. The first story reminds me of J-Horror, the second has kind of a DePalma feel to it, and the final short actually reminds me of a Tale From The Crypt episode. Not a bad watch; creepy at times and amusing at others. You can really sense the passion the director and performers have for their work. Recommended for those who want to see how an independent horror movie should be made and produced for little or no backing."
5,Renewing Singing in the Church,"Wren is one of the most accomplished living hymn-writers in the English language. Who better then to remind us of the importance of strong singing for Christian worship? I have cherished this book myself since it appeared, but this year I have also made it required reading for the seminarians I teach in my Introduction to Worship course. It is an ideal source for anyone who wishes an engaging treatment of the history of singing in worship and a fair-minded discussions of the issues such as the use of contemporary music and inclusive language."
5,Attitude is Critical,This book has helped me in both my personal life and in my teachings to the church in which I pastor. This is not a theological piece filled with the depth of doctrine. It was not written to be that - it is howevever a look at biblical perspective to having a healthy heart - the type God can really use. Don't waste so much energy on the negative and on your past - look to all that Jesus provides for you and the power for you to live a heart-healthy successful life.I love this book and I love Wayne! He is the real deal and New Hope and more imporatantly his heart to serve the body of Christ is proof of this.
5,Excellent Book,Excellent book by Pastor Wayne Cordeiro. Pastor Wayne is a gifted writer and I have bought several copies of this book for friends.
1,Con artist,Know what else attracts success? Duping gullible people. Wayne Cordeiro runs ads in other countries that strongly imply that only if you send WC your money JC will reward you with great wealth. He is conning poor people out of money they cannot afford to give away. He lives the high life by ripping off others. What makes it even more appalling is that those ads depict little children dressed up in adult clothes acting out the scene of rags-to-WC-to-riches. Shame on him!
5,Music to Relax By,"With the new year upon us, why don't you give yourself a real break after the hectic Christmas season. Turn the lights down low; pull the drapes; light some candles or sit by the fireplace; drink a favorite beverage; cuddle up with someone special and put this CD on.Bert Kaempfert is unparalleled for good listening and dance music; his undeniable style and sound is at its peak on this collection. Who cares if the mood stays the same? The songs definitely DO NOT sound alike, nor are they BLAND. What more could a listener want from a superb artist like Mr. Kaempfert.""Three O'Clock in the Morning,"" ""Rose of Washington Square,"" all the songs are classics that have never sounded better!So, stretch that holiday glow into the new year and have a wonderful evening with truly exceptional company!!"
3,Bland Bert charts good selections,"Bert Kaemfpfert's sound is distinct and there's no denying that. Though sometimes all his tunes tend to sound the same and that's what happens to this album, ""Three O'Clock in the Morning"" There are 16 selections on this so it's a good deal music-wise and the four bonus tracks provide the best Bert on this selection."
3,Dissapointing,"Bert went through a phase for a few years in the mid 60's making mellow romance style music - like this one - a follow up to Blue Midnight.You'll like it at first, but after a few numbers....well:Every number is virtually the same - the same beat - not enough brass - lots of wooing from the chorus section.You can sense the potential - of things to come in the next few years, making it interesting as a curio.I actually listened to this at 3 oclock in the morning once - no difference"
4,Good for Seasoned Programmer Learning C++,"I've programmed in several languages, and use programming regularly in my research (mostly artificial life simuations, statistical programming, and the like). I resisted learning C++ because (a) the implementations have been really awful, as compare with Visual Basic and Delphi, and (b) it's a complicated language. But this summer I bit the bullet, and I've started using C++ in my work. What changed my mind was the Borland C++ Builder compiler, which makes it easy to write applications. I found that C++ was as complex as I expected, but quite fast and versatile. This book really helped me understand the design philosophy of C++, so I feel much more at home with the language than I did just a few days ago. I can't imagine that this book would be good for a beginner at programming, though, since it throws around computer science terminology quite freely (early binding, late binding, for instance), and without much explanation."
3,For the Novice C++ Programmer,I was taking a graduate class for beginning C++ students. The book gave a wonderful history of C++. I would recommend for students who have not taken C or C+ to understand the scope of how powerful C++ is. This is also a good book for the introduction to object-oriented programming.
5,What a great book!,"If you're a serious C++ programmer, and love to read about interesting technical stuff, this book is great. You won't learn C++, and you probably won't become a better C++ programmer, but you'll have a much greater appreciation for why C++ is the way it is. Why the features that is has were added, and why the features that it doesn't have were rejected, and why certain details came out the way they did."
2,"Decent story, but lacked passion","I agree with the other reviewers that the story was well researched and the heroine was well written. Dena's feelings and motivations were constructed in a such a way that the reader could feel for and with her. However, as a romance novel this was very much lacking. There was some longing, but very very little passion. With all of the books out there I admit that I read historical romance novels for the steamy passion and emotion. I want the scenes of gazing into her beautiful green eyes, and the descriptions of the hero aching to touch the heroine. I am not saying that I am looking for erotica, but I enjoy a well constructed romance which includes passionate scenes, not just a quick romp in the barn. Literally gals, one scene. The rest is the descriptions of longing and the dismay at the separation of our hero and heroine. It was a really good first book and was definately written from the heart."
2,Not well made,This brush is just not well made- it's almost imposible to get the soap in the dispenser and it doesn't fit our Dr. Brown's bottles very well.
4,Good fun,"A little easier than it's predecessors due to the ability to charge the mega buster, but a very fun game with very different levels to shoot your way through. It makes me wonder why they ever stopped making Mega Man games this way. (Thanks Mega Man 9)"
3,"This is the US only adapter, not the universal one","Despite the photo showing adapter plugs for international travel, the product number is the same as the US only one for sale on Creative's web site."
5,Good to have....,Very good product to have for faster charging and when a computer is not available for usb charging.
1,Creative has a production problem,"I'm in the same boat as Iris (below). My adaptor came with a Chinese plug. I exchanged it, and the second one also came with a Chinese plug."
3,Sounded great till it Malfunctioned,"The sound is great on this speaker, however, the system after 30 days will not work on batteries and the unit gets extremely hot. Will be notifying the manufacturer."
5,Power Adapter,This is SOOO much better than plugging it into the computer with the short USB connector and now I can take it with my anywhere and not have to worry about running out of battery.
3,Wonderful While It Lasted,"This was a great charger while it lasted. It would charge my Zen very quickly like you would expect from a good charger. I also liked that you could listen to your Zen while it charged. Sadly, this product is very fragile. It fell onto a hard wood floor from about waist height and broke on contact and was not reparable. I expected this thing to last longer than it did. That sad story out of the way, this is a great charger if you can be gentle with it. Do not drop it or throw it around or you will easily break this great charger."
5,"Great Prduct!!!, Quick Charge","Charge very quick, and I know that my battery will last longer, with this product"
4,Zen V+ Power Adapter,A must have for the Zen V+. Works very well and much faster than the usb charger. SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED WITH THE ZEN V+. You should not have to buy this separate.
4,Haunting and Beautiful,"Like most Westerners, I am both horrified and fascinated by the Chinese tradition of footbinding. I found this book to be an excellent source of images and history, and cultural context of this rite of passage for Chinese girls. I appreciated that this book is written in a neutral voice, allowing the reader to explore the many meanings of footbinding, rather than simply condemning it as an abhorrant practice."
5,Splendid Slippers,"This book was absolutely wonderful. Before reading this book my knowledge of the ancient tradition of footbinding was very limited. In fact, what I thought I knew about the subject was woefully wrong. The pictures along with the literature were truly educational and now I feel I have a good understanding of the subject. I also bought a book (novel) called Snowflower and The Secret Fan. This novel was an excellent book that complimented the Splendid Slipper book. Thanks for recommending it!"
3,personally grandmammy,"great pictures.my grandmother and great grandmother were golden lotus girls. and as far as i can remember, my grandmother told me that only very selected few people who were wealthy could afford to have their daughters crippled. she did mention that girls with golden lotus feet fetched a higher dowry."
3,Bound to Please,"I think one needs to appreciate the philosophy and visual appeal of the art of foot binding and not focus on the pain which distracts from the goal of the binder afficiando. Small female feet--when in right proportion of heel, arch and toes--are indeed God's supreme work of erotic beauty. A woman's foot, if it is sculpted to near perfection naturally or artifically, is an object far more sexual than female genitalia or breasts. While time may has passed by this wise and ancient custom, as practiced by Asians, there are some very intelligent, cultured contemporary foot-fetish devotees who enjoy their fetish dominas binding their feet, albeit temporarily, for visual enjoyment. So please--we must not rush to judgement on this ancient and divinely inspired erotic art."
4,It is a comprehensive overview of the subject.,"I started to read this book with some apprehension due to its subject matter, however, once I started, I couldn't put it down. Ms. Jackson's in-depth research is evident in each chapter, and it educated me as to a mysterious custom which is difficult for Occidentals to comprehend. What a great book!"
5,This is a lovely book,"This is my favorite book on Chinese footbinding and Lotus shoes. It is very well written, and the author doesn't get into any emotional rants on the ""evil men forcing women to suffer"". She does a great job of explaining the cultural issues of footbinding. The photos of the shoes are fantastic. This is a must read book if you're interested in footbinding or shoes."
3,VERY best of the VIDELS,"this cd contains the most well known videl songs.the reviewer calling them 1 hit wonders should consider 2 things;1,their songs didn't get the promotion needed to push them along & 2,anders,poncia,marzano & cilittri went on to be the tradewinds.the same as the videl lineup(minus herb ritchie).the 1st half of this album represents the true (white itlo) doo wop sound of the late 50's - early 60's.if you like that era,you'll truly enjoy the 1st.half of this cd.my personal opinion is 4 stars,but i'm an anders/poncia fan anyway.so in fairness to those who aren't as familier with them.i think you'll agree that 3 stars is fair."
3,didn't even open it,i bought this DVD to compare it with another one that i had ordered at the same time. i decided that it wouldn't suit my needs and i sent it back for a refund.
3,It's okay.,"This is a poetry book by Felice Holman. The poems in this book are about children's experiences and are told from the first person point of view. This makes it easy to emphasize with the author on such topics as being scared of things outside the window when it is dark outside. Some of the titles of the poems include ""Who Am I?,"" ""Bedtime,"" ""The City Dump,"" and ""The Lullaby."" The poems are not written in traditional forms like limerick, haiku or sonnet. They appear to be mostly free form. The book includes a number of sketches in black and white. These sketches are simple and generally small. The pictures relate to the poems on the page."
4,Great Book,"This book is a great book to buy, whether for your own personal collection or for auditions...I bought it for an audition and it worked wonderfully!To those who say that this book is not complete, I humbly suggest they change the words to ""Pharoh's Story"" to creat the ""Prologue"" and also, not all versions of the show featured the ""Any Dream Will Do"" at the beginning. Some shows only did it at the end...but it's still the same song (minus the narrator's part)This is a great book and I'm really happy with my purchase!"
2,Not the one you think!,"No, this score does not include every song. For those of us that were entralled with the recordings featuring Jason Donovan, Michael Damian, or Donny Osmond, this score is a disappointment. It does not open with the narrator introduction and the prologue that excerpts Any Dream Will Do. Rather it opens cold with Jacob and Sons. Perhaps that is the way Webber and Rice expanded it in the early 1970's, but if you have only recently fallen in love with this show, this is not the score you think it is! Granted, it is a complete vocal score including solos and chorus parts, which makes it lightyears above the Piano/Vocal/Guitar ( ) that one usually finds for these shows, but please don't buy this thinking that you are getting everything on the CD or video."
4,unconquered spirit CD review,"this cd contains song and music of native americans of the plains and southwest in local indigenous styles along with tracks of more modern styles and interpretations, providing strong examples of before- and after-contact types of expression."
5,"Above average collection of BONNIE, BONNIE, BONNIE","No one is ever totally satisfied with ""Best of"" collections, but this one is definately on the mark as having a very well thought-out selection representing a fairly wide sampling of Bonnie. I'm happy to see many selections of what, IMHO, Bonnie Raitt does best: sing the blues.What's interesting, are the inclusion of some duets, with songwriter/singers of some classics: Women Be Wise with the incomparable Sippy Wallace comes to mind. The duet with John Prine on Angel From Montgomery gives you the feel of a live concert when ""surprise"" guests would stroll on-stage for a jam.For those of you who wondered all those years, ""What's the fuss?"" THIS IS IT! Together, in one CD, Under the Falling Sky, I Feel the Same and My First Night Alone Without You. Ear candy of the finest kind!"
4,fine watch,"I think this was less than $20, so how could I complain? Well, OK, let give a mild complaint: button controls are a bit complicated."
2,Not for men,"Definitely it is too small for a man. It would be suitable for a teenager or women. Nice looking and interesting features. Don't know how to turn off the beep, so it can not be used for students during tests."
2,Disappointed,This watch does not suit a man as the face is far too small. Would be fine for a woman.
4,Great product,I bought for my hubby as valentine gift and he loves it. Is not too bulky and serve the purpose.
2,Broken Band Holder,After daily use for abut one month the portion of the watch that retained the band broke off. It is impossible to keep any band on the watch as the metal pin to hold the band has nothing in which to sit.The electronic portion of the watch itself still functions normally but a wristwatch that cannot stay on your wrist is not very practical.
5,"Bought for fiancee for the gym, she loves it!","I bought this as a gift for my fiancee when she is at the gym and she loves it. This watch is rugged, easy to use, has a nice backlight, and will run for 10 years on the factory battery.Perfect for the gym or other situations where you want a watch but might end up giving the watch a beating."
4,runner's watch,the only disappointment is that the passer tone only works for 30 seconds and then you have to reset it every 30 seconds if you want to keep it going very good value for price
4,"Plenty of features, not gigantic",This watch is a nice size. Most men's watches are utterly gigantic and ostentatious. This watch is large enough to read and stays out of the way.I bought this watch to time my runs and splits and it does that very well. It also has lap memory and a countdown timer and a bunch of other features that are useless.Overall I am happy with my purchase.
4,"Just the basics, but a solid running watch","I bought this for my son, a cross-country runner, and it records laps and splits and is easy to use. I've offered him my Garmin Forerunner watch, but he prefers the simplicity of this watch."
3,Casio STR300C-1V,"The most important function for me in a running watch is the ability to have at least two countdown timers that count in seconds. The countdown feature on this watch will only count down in round minutes. If that is not important to you, this watch should be plenty adequate for your needs."
4,What a Chair !,"It arrived well-balanced (no uneven legs and all in one piece which is great that I didn't need to put it together). It's in the sun room. It has a look of quality and is very well constructed. The cushion is nice, but when that one wears down in the future, I will replace it with a fatter one. For extra comfort to my back, I put a nice palm tree toss cushion that I got the idea from a Florida Design magazine. My cat really loves this chair too !"
4,"""The Office"" Meets ""The Classroom""","""Chalk"" is a faux documentary that may generate more than a few faux laughs. It humorously portrays the challenges of public school teachers and administrators. The situations are often farcical and remind you that, for all its similarity, ""Chalk"" is a send-up of a documentary rather than a genuine documentary. The characters, despite their quirks or perhaps because of them, I found appealing.The scene with the ""Spelling Hornet,"" where the teachers compete in a spelling-bee type contest to spell the students' street-slang is a riotous hoot and by itself makes the movie worth watching.A real good soundtrack as well. A pleasant way to spend 80 minutes ..."
4,Really funny.,"It's just a funny movie. Like mockumentary's like ""The Office"" each character has his/her own quirks that are pretty entertaining. But the characters and themes aren't so off the wall it's unbelievable. Most of the time you know someone like the characters. I recommend it."
3,Never gets over that hump,"I think 3 stars perfectly sums this movie up. It's not bad, not good, it's just kinda there. It has it's funny moments and the children behave very realistically, but, it feels like they could have done so much more with the material. If anything, this should be listed under dramas because you wind up doing more empathizing than laughing. ""Office Space"" this is certainly not, but it will make you reconsider if you've ever wanted to teach. I think it's worth a glance but it's hardly the kind of thing you'll be forcing your friends/family to watch."
2,Funny parts - but it sure isn't as funny as some reviewed here,"No I'm not a teacher or engineer as someone else here stated - as if this would help the movie be more funny. Yes in the first half of the movie it tries to convey ""teachers are people too"", but once you get that picture the movie is coasting down hill without gaining momentum. You can only laugh at a dim-wit teacher who is as un-comfortable being a teacher as he is being a man so often. The the a-typical female gym teacher who is NOT gay but has issues too is also thrown in. But for me if the movie took each teachers personality and gave it more depth as the movie went forward there would be reason to finish watching it. Overall once you get the first couple laughs it just vomits the same thing up over and over again leaving that kind of acid taste in your mouth - like one more time is one more time too many. At least it was only 99 cents and 45 min spent on this movie that had way more potential than it delivered."
3,I thought this was a real documentary,"I actually thought this was a real documentary by the guy who filmed Super Size Me about the struggles of novice teachers until a goofy dream sequence, which made it obvious that none of it was real. I realized this was actually a mockumentary in the style of the TV show The Office. I think the filmmakers should have left this fantasy sequence out, because, while funny, it took me out of the movie. The film felt very authentic until that sequence. It felt like a warts and all portrait of teaching, not something all glossy like Mr. Holland's Opus or Mr. Chips. The actors are very natural in their roles and look like ordinary people, not movie stars. A good film, but it should have cut out the dream sequence and the other few scenes (like one with a teacher throwing a desk) that ruined the real-life feel of the film. I would definitely recommend this to teachers or those thinking of becoming teachers."
3,"Much like ""The Office""","Much like the show ""The Office"", this mockumentary features the teachers of Harrison High School. The mockumentary was pretty good and funny at times. If you like shows like ""The Office"", this shows has the same format. The funniest parts of the film are the Teacher of the Year Debate (when the teacher says that he is a product of corporal punishment and what he has learned it that ""if you can't beat them, join them"") and the Spelling Hornet (where the teachers are the ones on the spelling contest trying to spell out slang words). This film is pretty funny.As another reviewer mentioned, the acting was very natural and although I knew this was a mockumentary, I found myself wondering at times if it was indeed real and I was mistaken."
2,skip this one,"Morgan Spurlock has given us so many great movies. Can't believe he has anything to do with this one, since it's so bad. The concept is hilarious, but it goes on, and on, and on...and ON. Seems like it never ends. The characters have a seed of interest and potential, but nothing that is interesting to watch for a full movie.Got this because I saw the preview and thought it was a real documentary. It's not. It's a mockumentary, much like Spinal Tap. That would be great, if it was funny. It's not.Good concept, but not well done. My advice is to skip that one."
1,Lame-o-rama,"This movie was pretty horrible. When I rented it, I thought it'd be a true documentary (especially with Morgan Suprlock's name on it). In fact, it was a mostly un-funny scripted ""mocumentary"". Don't waste your time or money on this one."
5,"The Best Relaxation, Yoga, Meditation CD","I have owned three CDs, given to me for Yoga, by Steven Halpern, for 10 years. Of the three (higher ground and dawn), Comfort Suite is my absolute favorite. I have used it as a ""high energy"" uplifting yet consistent background accompaniment to hundreds of meditations and before sleep slow-down sessions. It is by far my absolute favorite and is a must have for your collection. Thanks to Steven Halpern."
1,WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?,"So every time I hear about the Ramones it's always about how much they have influenced my favorite bands. Green Day, Rancid, Jimmy Eat World, Good Charlotte, ya know PUNK! But every time I looked at their CD at Walmart I was like god who are these hippies. With their stupid long hair and dirty clothes. Eventually I was like what the hell I'll check it out. I was pretty surprised cause it is pretty PUNK sounding but really not that great. All I gotta say is if they were still around and played a concert with Blink 182 - Blink 182 would blow them off the stage!"
4,The Ramones are Punk,"To the kid who likes B182 and buys his CDs at walmart. Your review speaks for itself. You ain't a punk if you like all those light weight bands and if you buy your CDs at walmart. The Ramones along with the Pistols invented punk nearly 30 years ago. When they first came out they were revolting against the radio, not trying to fit nicely between Britney Spears and Sting like B182 and the rest of those phaux-punks"
3,disappointed,"I bought this DVD because one of the same title was on Netflix. It also had 3 other stories that I really, really liked.So I bought this, thinking it was the same. It wasn't. It has 4 stories, but only 2 are the same as the Netflix one. I didfind the DVD which was on Netflix on another website and bought 2 copies. All is well that ends well."
1,WHAT IN THE WORLD?,This album deserves -10 because I didn't here most of the music that was played in the movie. If its a YOU GOT SERVED soundtrack wouldnt you think they would put the music that was playing the movie? Some of the songs on the soundtrack I never heard in the movie. Anyway don't buy it if you're expected to hear the battle songs because there isn't any in the CD.
3,BATTLE SONGS,"Hey if anyone knows anythin about that battle song that goes something like ""If you dont know now then you gonna find out"" please email the information to me.Thank You!"
3,songs,I just saw the movie and i was hopin that the soundtrack would have all the battle songs but it doesnt so if any1 knows them can they please email me at Rimrocka0834@yahoo.com
1,this cd aint good at all,"This cd sucks the two songs i was looking for were in the trailer and i dont even what there called except for the one drop by timbaland and magoo. "" If you dont know now you going to find out"" if anyone knows what that is. PLZ.!!!!! TELL ME! or e-mail me at da_jatt_outlaw@hotmail.com!!! I NEED TO WHO SINGS IT AND THE TITLE!!!"
2,The Good Dance beats in the movie,"Anyone know anymore of the sweet songs that were in all the break scenes of the movie?Timbaland & Magoo feat Fat Man Scoop - Dropis one.. looking for others.. the one DMX one was pretty bad ass, thanks!"
3,ANSWER!!,"All right, as I have been reading through these reviews I saw about a million people asking about the song that goes something like ""you don't know now but you gon find out, party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled.."" It's played during the trailor, but anwyays, it's actually De La Soul ft. Redman and the song is called ""Oooh."" Look for a remix-it's cooler that way."
2,What Happened,The movie was awsome! I went to buy the soundtrack expecting to hear some of the battle music. That's not what I got. Most of the songs were by B2K. NOW don't get me wrong I love B2K but make another soundtrack with at least 5 battle songs.
2,Movie song....,"There's a song in the movie and on the trailer to the movie, it goes, ""you don't know now but you gon find out, party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled, get out yo seats and let's get ill."" Does anyone know who's song this is? I know the lyric is taken from Jam Master Jay from way back but I don't know who sings this song! This soundtrack blows....."
2,"Umm, bad!","I LOVE B2K 2 DEATH, but the soundtrack was TRASH, TRASH, TRASH... the songs on that album was so stale! The only songs I liked on the album was 'Take it to the Floor', 'Out the Hood' 'Fizzo Got Flow' and 'Happy'. You could tell the group was about to split when this soundtrack appeared. I still got madd love for them, but Chris Stokes, T.Scott, and Marques Houston should be ashamed of making these guys look like dumbies on this soundtrack."
2,B2K HAS BROKEN UP,i hate B2K but the guest appearences on this album give it 2 stars...B2K HAS BROKEN UP!!!! it is almost official a press release is coming out soon
1,Way too many slow songs,"They picked a pretty lousy selection of tunes for a movie with such great music (and dancing). Very disappointing. I wish I would have looked more closely at the tracks before purchasing. Most of the songs are slow, no good for dancing. Only great track: Ante Up (#13)"
1,Sucks ass,"I thought this would be the sound track of the entire movie. Not just some sucky b2k. The only cool song on here was the last Track ""Ante up"". Im extremely dissapointed."
5,DROP THA MONEY ON THERE TABEL AND BUT NOW,BRILLIANT QUALITY BRAND NEW AMAZING PRICESWHO NEEDS EBAY!!!XXX:-P
3,You Got Served is Only Good for B2K Music,This movie soundtrack is only good for the B2K music. I all of B2K's songs is great but the other songs are stupid and not moving.
3,I Agree,"I agree with the reviews on here, there is a lot of music on the film which is missing on the cd.The song at the final battle is DMX Get It On The Floor and the song at the opening battle is Drop by Fatman Scoop and Crooklyn Clan If that helps at all."
3,no battle songs???,i streamed this cd at walmart..it wasn't worth buying...no battle songs..thats what i was expecting to be on the cd.... here some of the tite songs on the cd:*Drop-Timbaland ft. fatman scoop*Find Out- Aceyalone ft. Riddlore*Lets get it on(get it on the floor)-DMX*Ante Up- M.O.P.*Take it to the floor-B2K*Anxiety-Black Eyed Peas*Fizzo Got Flo- B2K*Its Over-Run DMCif any of yall breakers/dancers got any tite songs with some good beats hit me up...
3,not bad,"the songs in the soundtrack are not bad, but all the serious hiphop rap tracks weren't included. its more like an ad for b2k"
2,soundtrack,the cd is good if u like b2k but there are only some dance beats and some slow jams...by the way the song played in the last battle is pump it up by joe budden i think
2,you got served the album,"i like the cd they are a lot of great tracks on there, these guys put a lot of effort into making this album a good one. my personal favorite on this disc has gotta be the song happy by jhene. i think this song really draws your attention it the type of song you must have. but overall the disc is good and i encourge anyone to buy it"
2,Its ok,I loved the you got served movie. But in reality the soundtrack wasn't good at all. I am looking for the nas song that was playing when marcus houston was getting beat up. If anyone knows the name of the song please tell.
1,Other songs...,"I found some of the songs that weren't on the soundtrack.""Heaven"" by Nas ft. Jully Blackand the song that everybody has been looking for...""you don't know me but you going to find out"" thats ""It's Over"" by Run DMC and JD but it's a different remix."
3,song title?,"does anybody know the song title and singer of that song they play when ""david"" walks ""liyah"" to work?..it goes..""i'll be down for you............"""
4,songs in the movie,"when david walks liyah to work, the song playing is either ""Down 4 U"" by Jhene featuring Naskar, or ""Down 4 u pt 2"" by jhene feat lil fizz of b2kThey should release another version of this soundtrack with all the songs NOT on there, cuz i thought the songs in the movie were a lot better than some of the others. They just couldnt afford to pay for the copyrights"
3,"""Find Out"" is Aceyalone on the album, ""Love and Hate""","You don't know now but you go'n' find out...the song from the trailer is ""Find Out"" by Aceyalone feat. Riddlore. It's on the album, ""Love and Hate"" (sold on Amazon). Peep more about Aceyalone at www.projectblowed.com. The entire album is dope. ""Find Out"" is not even the best song on it. Check out Acey's full catalog and get your coat pulled to one of the tightest MC's that so many of y'all are truly sleepin' on."
1,What's the deal?,"I was disappointed to see that the soundtrack was missing the battle songs. Someone asked about the old school jams. One is called Choice is Yours, and it's by Black Sheep. That song came out in 1991 or so...i was ten and remember singing it on the playground, etc. The chorus goes...""you can get with this or you can get with that...i think i'll get with this, cause this is where it's at"". The bridge goes...""engine engine number nine on the new york transit line, if that train falls off the track...pick it up, pick it up, pick it up."" I was hoping the soundtrack would have songs such as this...but oh well."
1,cd is just aiite,man this b2k cd sucks theres only 2 good songs on the cd badaboom and take it to the floor. what songs i really want is all the songs they played while they battled in the movie. i listend to that run dmc song its over and thats not the song they played in the movie. run dmc said it but thats not the song in the second battle when b2k guys battled the girls. can anyone hook everyone up with all the battle songs?? cuz those are the only tight songs i everyone wants.
1,SOMEONE POST THE BATTLE SONGS PLEEEEASE,"EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT THE BATTLE SONGS ARE, GUY WHO WORKS IN A MOVIE THEATER, YEA WE KNOW ITS SHOWN AT THE END OF THE MOVIE CREDITS BUT WE DIDN'T SIT THERE WITH A NOTEPAD AND WRITE THEM DOWN OR STAY THAT LATE SO COULD YOU PLEASE POST THE TITLES? THANKS!"
3,It's Great.,"The CD is good, but most people buy the soundtrack to listen to the music from the movie. I bought it before the movie came out, so I though it was good. Though when I watched the movie, I thought ""I want that song, why isn't it in the CD."" I also remember someone sitting next to me asking his friend, why all the songs on the album are mostly B2K and not all the mixes heard on the movie.I recommend this CD if you just want to hear some good dance beats, but if you want to hear the songs from the movie I suggest find out the songs and looking for the single."
3,You Got Served,"HY im looking for a song on the movie You Got Served the song is not on the sountrack the song is played on the movie in the second battle, plese is someone now the title and the artist,send me and @mail to amdsony@hotmail.com thaks for helpme."

5,BATTLE SONG....,the song where they first battle wade's crew and lose is *flipside* by freeway ft. peedi crakk...its on the bad boys 2 soundtrack....song is off tha hook!! holla!
3,this is a B2K album not a movie soundtrack,"Okay if your a B2k fan and enjoy their music than you will love this cd. However, if your looking for the music from the movie this is not itAND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THE SONG AT THE END OF THE MOVIE IS DMX- GET IT ON THE FLOOR"
2,To: A music fan,"The song that you are looking for with the lyrics ""Breathe In, Breathe Out"" is called Drop by Timbaland and Magoo feat. Fatman Scoop. You're right, it's not on the soundtrack. That's what I was going to buy the cd for but it's not on there."
3,Last battle song,"The track for the very last deciding battle is by Joe Budden and is titled ""pump it up"". I thought this was one of the best tracks in the movie and was annoyed that it was'nt featured on the soundtrack. I'm sure im not the only one who searched hight and low to find the name and the artist of that specific song, so i thought i'd post here to save others some time and just incase anyone else was wandering."
