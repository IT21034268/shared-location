5,LuvAlwayz Is Awesome!,"J. Daniels and Shonell Bacon did a wonderful job with this novel.I was very moved by the friendship shared by the characters. That sort of bond is nothing short of necessary. When love steps in, nothing can go wrong. Well...sometimes, but love always finds a way of working itself out when it's destined to be. I found the individual stories of the LuvAlwayz characters refreshing and sensual. The love scenes will leave you BREATHLESS AND HOT! The positive portrayals of the men in this book gave hope to women all over the world. I've heard some people say these kind of love is fiction only. I don't believe that. READERS, PLEASE PICK UP THIS NOVEL!! I guarantee you will be left with love in your heart, a smile on your face and joy in yuor spirit. CONGRATULATIONS J. DANIELS AND SHONELL BACON. YOU HAVE A WINNER HERE!..."
3,Anecdotal but eye opening.,"Sometimes it's a challenge to take a step back and observe, especially where our children are concerned. My natural response to my son's curiosity has always been to get involved and to interject my own knowledge into his little discoveries. This book is worth reading if for nothing else than a fresh perspective. It is highly anecdotal, but this encourages a more apprising view of the educational system and our children. Having read this book I am noticing things about my son that I had not originally made the intellectual space for. For many of us, homeschooling our children begins by altering our own view of the world."
2,Wiping and wiping wax,"I too bought this Eagle One Nano wax after watching the infomercial. It looked so easy and the shine was fantastic on TV. Maybe I am not doing it right but I'm telling you be prepared to extend some serious elbow grease trying to wipe this wax off without leaving smudges and swirls. Over and over harder and harder and still the smudges. That was on dark blue, new paint. Yes, the spray on was easy but the removal was a bear. I couldn't recommend this wax."
4,inventive & unpredictable,"Heard Kris Delmhorst being interviewed and singing on NPR, and what an interesting project this is! It appealed to me on both literary merits and for the snappy songwriting. The e e cummings poem ""Pretty How Town"" is not done the way one would expect -- sad or romantic -- but is a perky cowgirl-type song."
1,Save your money!!!,"You won't learn anything from this video. It just shows a couple of tricks and gives no sound explanation when one should use them. Funny facts:1. When they show a formula car, the driver doesn't heel-and-toe!2. When they drive a ""Porsche GT3,"" they only show the windshield. The car doesn't really seem to be a Porsche, it looks more like a replica.3. The video literally repeats itself; at first you may think that something went wrong, but that is, in fact, a 'feature.'If you ignore my warning, you'll waste your time finding other flaws, and your money."
1,dont bother,its too old to play with current computers It looked like it could have been a great product when it did work
1,Caution on THIS edition!,"G.K. Chesterton's classic Epic Poem is a masterpiece and gets a 5 Star Rating by every English professor on earth. But this particular edition, the paperback printed by Quiet Vision Publishing, is worthless! As soon as you turn the page, each and every one, it comes out of the binding and falls on the floor! Somebody needs to report that company to the BBB."
4,A great rollicking poem,"Thank God there is an free-standing edition of this poem in print. I was afraid it would only be available in a large collection. It would be better still if it was pocket sized, paper-back, and had a figure of a white horse on the front!"
5,Cheaper than surgery!,"This will certainly achieve the desired result. Just keep in mind that the silicone will get a little uncomfortable when your body temperature rises (like if you go out dancing, for example) because there's no cloth to absorb your perspiration."
3,Limited Usefullness,"The flora is doubtlessly competent and nearly complete though somewhat dated. Additionally, there are comments regarding habitat. You will not find pictures or discriptions, however."
2,"Primitive, rough, malleable, and cheap","Bends quite easily, and has rough edges. It even arrived bent, and I had to bend it back with my hands to (approximately) straight.The GreatNeck 11059 Aluminum Rafter Angle Square may be low cost, but that's all it's worth."
5,Very Suspensful,I really enjoyed this book. It was hard to put down. It grabs your attention from the beginning and doesn't let go..
1,Great descriptions but horrible read!,"I was on a book kick, and while looking for something appealing to read, I saw ""summer"" by Edith Wharton looking like something interesting to read. Well it was not! I did't like ""Ethan Frome"" but I thought of giving Wharton another chance but now I know I won't be reading her work anymore. The descriptions of new england are fascinating, lovely and wonderful. The descriptions of ribbons, fourth of july events, fireworks, and wonderful dresses is just awesome. The story, about Charity Royall who works in a library, lives with an old man whose her guardian and wants to marry her, falling in love with lucius harney, man about town, was horrible! sure, it glides you through, romanticizing you but the end leaves you with a thud!do not read this book!"
2,Strange Story,"This book is free on Kindle, so you can't really kick, but it's one of the oddest books I've ever read. I didn't find any of the characters likeable (not even the apparent ""heroine""), Wharton depicts rural New Englanders as a cruel, dogmatic, and ignorant lot, and the ending is pretty creepy. I did read to the end for the historical value (it's set in the late 19th century) but I kinda want those hours of my life back."
4,"Edith Wharton's ""hot Ethan Frome""","As in Ethan Frome, the protagonist--in this case, a young woman--is naive, uneducated, unsophisticated and can easily be taken advantage of. A visiting architectural researcher is attracted to her, and they embark on a sweet romance. He neglects to tell her that he is already engaged to another woman in town and when the implications of this catch up with him, he becomes dubious about what action he should take and goes away ""for awhile."" She, having learned the truth, urges him to keep his word and marry his fiancee although she finds she is pregnant. The book is lovely in its earlier parts but ends sadly, and for some it may be a downer. I thought it was very poignant."
5,Love this!,Great seller! Package arrived promptly and product was in great condition! Definitely would purchase from this seller again! Thank you!
3,You need to read between the lines...,"This is a great novel for its time (1917). I am sure it caused quite a stir when it was first published. I think it has lost much of its impact over the years. You really have to read between the lines to figure out what is going on. Maybe that is part of the beauty of this literature or maybe I have been out of AP English for too long. The plot of the novel, however, is timeless. A woman coming of age, falling in love, dealing with consequences, choosing paths."
5,Best Wharton Novel,"I'm doing my honors thesis on women authors of the early 20th century (Wharton, Cather, Chopin, Glasgow, etc)and began my reading with Edith Wharton's vast amount of novels. I slowly worked my way through House of Mirth, Ethan Frome, and the Age of Innocence because I had trouble involving myself with those novels. When I began Summer however, I was involved. The others I read because I had to. Summer... well, I took it with me to work, to the beach, and stayed up forever one night because I had to find out if Lucius would come back. This novel was written in 1917, but its themes and characters still involve the reader in the 21st century."
3,i hate the ending!!!,"when you begin summer you are enchanted with the small town atmosphere and the main character, charity. then when lucius harney arrives you adore their love story, but when you get to the end and you know charity is about to spend a life of unhappiness it makes you want to scream."
2,Just couldn't get into it,"Okay,I fully admit to not being a reader of the classics but every once in a while I have to give one a try (I usually pick a small one). I gave this one a try four times and could never get past chapter two. Took it to work to loan to co-workers. It would leave and then come back quickly, each time abandoned. I found Wharton's storytelling lifeless. Maybe it's just this particular book and possibly I'll give her another try but certainly not in the near future."
4,A modern-day soap opera written 80 years ago.,"This book has it all---intrigue, debauchery, sex and small town mindedness. The protaganist, Charity, lives a secluded life in a small northern town. Her life becomes fulfilled when a stranger arrives in town and changes her life forever."
1,horrible,I was so into this book. It was good and then I got to the end and was horribly disappointed. Could have went a little further with the ending. I really that it was unfinished but then read the reviews and realized it just had a stupid ending.
1,and a half stars -- kitchen utensil sounds,"Imagine letting loose a bunch of monkeys that had just smoked pot and had 6 shots of tequila inside a kitchen full of stainless steel utensils. If you record it, how would it sound?I'll bet it would be better than Halber Mensch. I tried to keep a straight face while listening to this CD. When I heard the lead singer emit a shriek that sounded like a Victorian lady who just found out that she had been violated by an orang utan, I couldn't control myself. I was giggling for the rest of the CD.After hearing this CD, I had an uncontrollable urge to record the sounds of flushing my toilet, mopping my kitchen floor and scrubbing my bath tub. Who knows! It would become a hit!!!The 1 and 1/2 stars are for Adrian Sherwood's remix."
3,"Nice concept, but....","I like the cocept of the book, but it just looks like someone copied the pages on a copier. Anyone could take the book out of the rings that bind it and copy it for another child."
1,Typo's and Errors.,"This book was a complete waste of money. There is nothing in this book that you shouldn't have already learned in high school and talking with girlfriends. This may be helpful if you were a displaced Victorian. I would not recommend this book to anyone; there are far too many books out there that tackle this subject better and more thoroughly.The thing that really irked me was all the typos and miss spelled words. There are pages were right in the middle of the sentence the text moves to the next page, leaving half of the other page blank. Oh, I almost forget, the pages started falling out. This is a very poorly written and edited book and they rushed this to press before they even proof read it. I am sorry but I do not see how others could rate this book higher than one star. = )"
3,Something light for your big screen,"I enjoyed this movie but i kept getting thrown off by the fact that it was set in england, but of course eveyone spoke french.the story is fun, it is a farce style comedy, both bardot and perkins are good in their roles. no heavy message here, just a nice diversion"
1,you send smaller than I bought,"When we received the boots we saw that you send the boots smaller than I bought, I bought size 9.5 M and you send 8,5 M, I can not return the boots because we live in other country"
3,nice looking day watch,"this watch is fine if you use it on day light since it does not have a light for nigh use and the background is black and the numbers are clear greyit has a elastic metal band and the numbers are big even for near sighed people they should be abel to read it, as i mentioned in day light"
1,junk,"I had been using Vermont American blades, and since Delta products USED TO BE quality, I tried them. The first blade broke within five minutes of installation, the second blade won't stay on the tires. I trekked out and bought a Vermont American that cuts much faster, turns easier, and is tracking straight on the saw. The VA blades are made under Bosch supervision in the US, the Delta blades are made in Mexico. Save money and buy VA. Three thumbs down on this one."
5,THE GREATEST EXOTIC DANCERS,THIS FILM WAS VERY NOSTALIGACE TO ME I HAD SEEN MANY OF THESEDANCERS IN MY YOUNGER DAYS
3,Some historical value,"Some good footage of bad dancers. Filmed in a 'documentary' style so fairly clean, could even be shown on late night tv. I enjoyed the info. as the dance progressed thru the ages, legal matters and ways around them but the dancing itself was poor for the most part. Good to all to an overall collection but doesn't stand alone."
4,Striptease,"Good historic review when people with average bodies rocked the audience with style, panache and for some grace. Simpler times and less access to the public allowed for variety, and a lot of artists to be engaged."
3,A valuable study aid.,"Although this documentary only takes in the American perspective, it is quite a good history from pre 1900 till the late 50s. I recommend this as a valuable study aid to students who are studying this subject for whatever reason, but it is not a film to get your rocks off or be titillated to."
2,Innocent Olden Days of Exotica,"If your younger than 70, you will consider this pretty stupid stuff to see. It used to be exciting back in the old days."
4,Fun but may not be worth the money,I bought this for my son who seems to enjoy the activities but as we all know with in a couple of weeks they grow old. My main complaint is that for the price there are really only five stations on this. In order to add or switch out a toy you need to remove one of their toys or activities. I guess my feeling is that the design could be better. It is fun for him at this point and that is what is important.
4,Good Toy,"This toy is actually pretty decent. It keeps my 4 month busy and all. As for the age recommendation, I believe it is a mistake on Amazon or Toysrus's Part because if you go to the Leap Frog website, it states that the recommended age is 4 months and up for this item. So please do not use this on a child who can not hold their head up. My recommended age would probably 5 months because we put cushion in the saucer(where she sits) so my 4th won't hit her head because she can hold her head up, but not that well yet."
3,"Great toy, when it works","My four month old son loves to sit in this toy and spin around. Mainly he uses the toy attachments as assistants in this movement. He likes the music, if it plays. I have to beat the jukebox pretty hard to get any response from it, and then once any music starts, it shuts off after 5-10 seconds. Is this normal, or do I just have a defective toy?I haven't had any problems with the toys being harmful, or my son hurting himself by leaning too far forward. I would really love it, and I think my son would actually learn if the cause and effect aspect worked properly."
3,Not that great - no surprise from this brand,"I'm not fond of LeapFrog's overemphasis on electronics and sound, and this gift hasn't changed my mind. It's well-built, and thank god there's a volume control, but there is only ONE non-electronic activity on it. I'd much rather have had a Fisher-Price saucer but my sister-in-law asked for this one for her baby so that's what we both got (I know, poor me!) If you are sold on LeapFrog's dumb premise that electronic music will make your child an advancement superstar, go ahead and spend $80 for 5 minutes of non-educational entertainment at a time.Oh and let's not forget safety -- fingers get pinched under the turntable arm, and that awful microphone ""teether"" is on such a stiff arm that once my son finally wrestles it to his mouth, he's out of steam, lets go, and gets thwacked in the head for his pains. I'm liking this toy less and less the more I write about it."
3,"Good idea, not so good words","I recently bought this for my 3 month old son. At first I was very excited about the product, then I realized not only could he not play with it (toys are stiff and difficult), but it teaches a child to say ""no"". Now, being a preschool teacher I know that one of the first words a baby learns is ""no"". So, out of all the words this would not have been my first choice, especially considering it is the first word actually said on the program. Decided to return product and exchange for something else."
2,THIS EXERSAUCER SWEARS AT MY CHILD!!,"I bought this item for my 4 month old son for christmas. I thought it was nice for about a month until he kept leaning on the purple number 5 button. He leaned on it very fast, and the ""F"" word is what it came out!! I am so mad that they didn't do the testing on this. Children don't press buttons, then let go. If this is one of his first words, I'll be suing"
2,Annoying and dangerous.,This exersaucer does not adjust high enough and my almost 10 month old launched himself out of it headfirst. Also the music is annoying and the microphone makes noise if you walk by it.
5,Worth every penny,"I bought the leapfrog activity station before I gave birth to my daughter and she'd used it since she was 5 months. It is worth every single penny and the best purchase I made in terms of baby things. She's only used it for a few weeks now but the difference in the way she relates to her environment, her sitting skills and her general awareness is amazing and I believe it has a lot to do with this piece of equipment."
4,My son enjoys it...,My son seems to enjoy this toy very much. It's pretty cute too. He gets very excited and smiles when the different music plays. I am planning on using it for my future children. I can sit my son in there for an easy 30 minutes and not hear a cry from his mouth.. The only con in my book is I wish it had more toys..
3,better off with the BABY EINSTEIN activity center,"I did quite a bit of research when buying a new one for my 4th child. Unfortunatley the previous one I had didn't last through my 6,4 & 2 year old boys. I was initially drawn to the Leap Frog name/brand, but after an examination of the product the BABY EINSTEIN stood out. The Leap Frog tray is flat with no rim, watch out for rolling cheerios if your little one is snacking in it, not to mention any other toys that could roll off. The Leap Frog doesn't offer much more than the music motif. In comparison the BABY EINSTEIN besides being $10 less, has numerous DIFFERENT toys introducing not only music, but animals, sounds, shapes, colors and fruits. Boy number 4 doesn't want out! Play leap frog and go straight for the BABY EINSTEIN."
1,Two Serious Defects,"Our 6-month-old son has loved this activity station (especially the microphone) for over a month, but he discovered two serious defects during this past week. First, two of his fingers got stuck under the record player (another reviewer identified the same problem). Second, while turning the book page he got one of his fingers caught behind it. We were right there both times and so were able to remove his fingers before he hurt them too badly (e.g., by twisting in the seat while his fingers were still caught), but he got really scared both times. We will not use this station again, which is a shame because he really did like it."
3,"New mom of ""Jasmine""","Me and my husband recently purchased this activity center for my 4 month old daughter. I was not impressed with it,She will only sit in it maybe 10 minutes before she is crying to get out. My main complaints is not many toys for the money you spend and second as soon as we put my daughter in it, my two year old niece came over, pulled back the mic and let go it hit my daughter square in the face and caused a bump on her forhead!"
1,WAY OUTDATED,"SAVE YOUR MONEY! The business aspecs may still work but highly unlikly,The technical parts are way outdated unless your only doing older machines."
4,Good Bang for Buck,Have been using it for around 2 months now. The scale measurements are pretty stable and don't vary more than 0.4 lbs at max. The only problem is the tapping interface which takes some time to get used to. A nice & stylish addition to your bath.Highly recommended if you don't want to spend alot of money and don't need any advanced features.
3,"Pretty, but a pain","This scale looks really nice and the display is very easy to read. However, I hate how you have to tap it really hard and in just the right place to get it to turn on. It is a huge pain."
1,Low Quality - Only worked twice,This item only worked for me twice. I even tried changing the batteries. What a disappointment. I'm sending it back.
5,ROGUE:SLAVE,"Well written. Lots of twists and turns. Just when you think you know whats going to happen, he pitches you a ""curve ball"" and off you go in a direction you hadn't concidered. Couldn't put the book down once I got started. Got to the point if my phone rang I just kept on reading and let the answering machine pick up. Great book by an author with a lot of talent. Just hope he puts out a sequel to it...there's a lot more story to tell I'm sure."
1,Cheesy cover should have warned me!,I felt this books lacked content. Mr. Pierce seems to have run out of words since repetition of phrases started to grind on my nerves.No interesting plot and the some of the story did not seem cohesive to me.I was disappointed since the synopsis seemed to interesting.
2,Only read it if you need convincing RE investment is worthy,"the book mainly points out that investing in income generating property is the best investment there is. I did NOT need to be convinced of that... if you do, then buy and read the book. If you already agree with that premise, then just go to his web site and spend [money] to join his club and start investing. If you want a HOW-TO on buying, owning, operating, or anything else that has to do with Income generating properties don't expect to get it from here. This is indeed a sales pitch for #1, the value of investing in income properties, and #2 for Al's Tortoise club."
3,Not Quite Uncle Vanya,"Chekhov's play Uncle Vanya is herein indirectly translated to the big screen and its setting is altered to that of post-World War One Australia in this moderately successful tale of unrequited love, carnal attraction, off-center politics, and the bored desperation that roils behind even the most outwardly contended of lives. While Michael Blakemore's film grabs freely at will a number of lines from Chekhov's play, the overall effect is one of imitation of the Russian master rather than direct tribute to him. Sam Neill plays his role well, as he always does, and the cast meshes nicely, it's just that Country Life might've possessed more gravitas had it been a stand-alone production without the tenuous connections to the Chekhov play."
2,Not a Comedy at All,"I expected something light and romantic, but with the substance the Australians are known for (Strictly Ballroom, Murial's Wedding, for instance). Tedious, boring, depressing, and in no way funny. Barely watchable despite big stars and good acting."
4,Adventure Romance,An excellent adventure romantic light comedy. Very fine acting by all. I'm not sure the characters are match to the actors as well as in Camilla or O Brother where art thou! But still I recommend it especially if you don't mind the accents (Australian-type).
2,A Major disappointment,"This version of a famous Russian work is described in the production notes as a ""delightful comedy."" According to the DVD box, the Chicago Tribune critic called it ""Great Fun!"" In fact, this is a very sick, sad, nasty piece of drama filled with frustrated passions and alcoholic ravings. The best it can be called is soap opera. Yes, the acting is good, and the photography is, at times, attractive. (The setting is central Australia.) But don't expect to laugh, or even smile. The bitter taste left by this film may last for days."
5,We can't get rid of this book!,I am finally purchasing a copy of this book after my son brought it home from his school library for the fifth time in a row. He's 3 1/2 and I thought it might scare him but I think it actually comforts him. It makes the bogeyman seem funny and harmless and gives kids a magical defense strategy (dirty socks). My son particularly appreciates that the bogeyman runs away to the sister's room at the end.
1,RIP-OFF SELLER,"How in the world could you dare ask this kind of price? I am trying to rebuild an underfunded school's library and this book is a favorite with the younger kids and ours has been taped and retaped. Now I understand the nasty remarks about money hungry IGNORANT, SELFISH idiots on Amazon. This is so disgusting. NOBODY should buy from you!!!!"
3,short changed,CD has only 3 songs - then included is a video of the first song. I expected a full CD.
4,Very Fine,"Bellow's esteemed novella is a marvel of immanently crafted, modern realism. Situated within the course of a day, Bellow brings us into the life of Tommy Wilhelm, a middle-aged failure who is looked down upon by his father, his ex-wife, and just about everybody else. When he is propositioned with an opportunity by a true snake-oil-salesman to play in the stock market, Tommy's fortunes fall even farther into disrepair. Bellow's prose is beautifully ornamented with a textured sense of detail-and there is genuine pathos to be found here-but I can't help but feel unmoved by the self-conscious sense of the epiphanic structure Bellow imposes. A fine work nevertheless."
2,"Dull, with a huge D.","This is a novel about boring things happening to boring people. The most boring hour of my day has more life in it than this novel. It's sad because i love the Adventures of Augie March (see my famous review); but unlike that book, the main character remains flat throughout, and nothing but nothing happens! I am getting bored even writing this review about it. Prescription: Lots of Nabokov."
2,VERY PADDED,"I've never gotten the whole Saul Bellow thing, but this one is very padded; very much a short story expanded to novella length"
3,Bradley's Book Review...,"Seize the Day is a fiction novel about a man in his early forties, named Wilhelm Adler. Constantly reminded of his past and his mistakes, he strives to do right, but has the worst of luck.Wilhelm continues to recieve advice from people close to him. He thn gets betrayed by someone he trusted. Will his proble goes unsolved at the end? This book is intersting to a certain degree, but that only my opinion."
2,Seize the day? Yes! Buy this book ? No!,"It took me longer to read this boring novella than it did to complete ""Gone With the Wind!"" I know, I know, Bellow is a Nobel prize winner, but just because his work has merit doesn't make me like this tedious book any better. This book is for you if the thought of endless talk about the price of soybeans and lard on the stock market, spoken by essentially dull characters, makes your heart beat faster and your pulse start racing. Thankfully, this book was not my introduction to Bellow; I started with his first two novels, ""Dangling Man,"" and ""The Victim,"" and I liked them. Then I read ""Herzog"" and ""Mr. Sammler's Planet"" and I LOVED them. I will never give up on this author -- he's a masterful writer, and his ""The Adventures of Augie March"" and ""Humboldt's Gift"" are waiting for me on my bookshelf. (Books are so patient.) But ""Seize"" was definitely a disappointing dud."
2,My Book Review,"In my opinion, this book is pretty boring. However the moral of the book is really good. As the reader learns one mans struggles in the world and how he trys to overcome them. But in the end... Read the book!!"
4,Very good,"This thin novel is a joy to read because it is a bright study of a man who is vaguely tortured by his own circumstances of the ""now."" The past haunts him. The future terrifies him. There is no wiggle room for this sorry fellow because the whole of the book takes place in one day's time. I could not help but see it as an ingenious story that dwelled insistently on the strength of palpable context and bare emotion."
5,A sensitive chronicle of a crumbling life,"A late Bellow, 'Sieze the Day' is a beautifully written story of a failed, luckless man in the last days before yet another unlucky decision sends him over the brink into financial and mental ruin. Bellow is penetrating yet characteristically compassionate in his telling of the tale. One of the great Bellow novels."
3,Father vs. son,"It hurt to read this book. Once a son, now a father, it is painful to see how poor this relationship can be. Who is correct here: father or son? What is clear here? Hatred."
2,A disappointing book -- I expected better from Saul Bellow.,"This slender novel -- really just an extended character sketch -- presents a morose, self-pitying loser gazing into his navel. There is almost nothing else worth reading here. I give it two stars rather than one only because Bellow is obviously a serious writer."
5,an agony to read about a loser losing,"This is Bellow's paean to failure, the slow slide of a good-hearted though dumb and self-destructive man. He is heading to his doom, and is a sucker the whole way. Reading this is hard, much like the inexorable decline of people in a Balzac novel, but it is a peculiarly American brand of failure with the post-war culture and Hollywood dreams in tow. It is a masterpiece.Recommended, but keep the valium handy."
2,I don't recommend this book.,"This book has a lot of information on the piano and keyboard, but it does very little to actually teach one how to play either of them. It does a decent job of teaching the individual notes, but the section on chords is not very good at all. The book also does not contain nearly enough practice pieces. Most of the book is just about the history of pianos and stuff like that. Buy this book only if you want to learn all about the piano and keyboard but not how to actually play them."
1,Totally Useless,"I must agree with the negative criticisms other reviewers have made of this book, but I would rate it even lower. The eager beginner will want to get his/her fingers on the instrument as soon as possibly, not sit around reading all day! (reading text, not even music at that) The information that is covered in this book is not particularly essential to the beginner. Worse, most of the book feels like padded-out fluff, with the many different kinds of sidebars cumbersome distractions.Don't be fooled by the complete idiot's ploy. This book is just a cash-in on the Idiot's/Dummies market with no real substance. Instead, get in touch with a piano teacher, and see what books he/she recommends, even if you don't want or can't afford to take lessons (Although lessons would be the most sure-fire way to obtain results.)"
2,Ack!,"Yes, I'm a complete idiot. And when I started reading this book, I had just gotten a keyboard. After a year of having a keyboard and this book, I could not read music, could not play piano, and worse, was really kind of scared of even re-trying to learn. This book is full of dull music and music notation, which if you don't know anything about music, you won't know what they're talking about. It all makes for a rather lame book.What finally turned it around for me was a combination of more user-friendly books and watching tutorials on youtube. I still can't read music, but I can play some good stuff on the piano now. Maybe one day I'll find the magic bullet that helps me take care of that first part."
1,NONE OF THEM WORKED!!!DO NOT BUY!,"I purchased a pack for the laser pointer for our dog( which needs 3 batteries)..none of them worked longer than 3 MINUTES!!!!Beware do not buy!!Thanks god I only bought one package to try them out, before I bought like 5 of these packs!!!"
4,NOT JUST A LOVER'S ROCK ARTIST,"Most likely you'll find the extended version of this fine album these days but either one will work. The main thing here is the album deals with more serious subject matter than what Gregory's known for. Fans of the film ROCKERS will know 'slave master' but there are other commentaries to listen to as well. I consider this record a wolf in sheep's clothing. Gregory still sings the songs in that mellow way we know and love, but there're stinging jabs waiting to be unleashed on the unsuspecting. Not every song is a social statement however, as there's a cover of The Temptations 'get ready'. Real reggae from one of reggae's finest."
3,NUFF RESPECT MISA ISAACS,I don't think that there is a Jamaican alive that doesn't remember his parents playing Gregory Isaacs at their Basement parties or hearing his voice on a sound system. You couldn't help but wonder how such a man could have such a distinct but beautiful voice. This album is geating harder and harder to find and although it doesn't have the passion of his Night Nurse album it still showcases his talent. It is this talent that has virtually every Reggae Singer in the world in awe of his singing ability.
1,1 star for packaging BUT 5 star for GREAT Service,"I was very disppointed when Amazon advised me that my order for this Prada bag is lost in transit. Therefore, I am not able to provide feed back on the product but rather on the after-sales service.I am a customer residing outside America and had paid a hefty sum for shipping charges of this light weight bag which was packed in a 30 lbs volumtric weight carton. This is my second order for Prada bag which led to non receipt at my end.However, I was thankful that the purchases were made through Amazon and they had resolved the issues amicably.I made online purchases rather frequently and must comment that among all merchants, I must grade Amazon as one of the best. Keep up Amazon!!!"
4,Entertaining Children's anthology,"With poems grouped winsomely into categories of animals and a great selection of works by Christina Rossetti, Lewis Carroll, Rudyard Kipling, Kenneth Grahame, Emily Dickinson, Hilaire Belloc and other notable poets, I find it a shame that this little paperback is out of print. It is wonderful for early elementary aged children, who can find many different moods and descriptions for amusement and appreciation. Dover please bring it back!"
5,Delta 28-074 Band Saw Blade for use with Craftsman Bandsaw,The saw blade arrived quickly and in good shape; The saw blade is of excellent quality
5,Perfect companion book,"This book is small enough to fit in your white coat pocket for those down times on the ward. It is much more concise than Microbiology Made Ridiculously Easy and a much better study tool for Step 1 and Step 2. Microbiology is one of those very important areas of medicine that comes up again and again, regardless of what field you decide to go into. Mastering it is key and you'll get a good grip on it with this book. Very useful."
5,"A wonderful, wonderful book","This book is as true as the day it was first published. Men truly need women, as the author writes, to ""socialize and civilize"" them. Without the influence of women, men are left to their own devices, and become slaves to their passions, which generally results in what would be termed ""anti-social"" behavior. ""Radical feminism"" is not good for this country, or any other. Rather than trying to make the sexes ""equal"", we should appreciate the differences. The author notes it is these differences that make society ""work"". This book is a great little gem, and definitely worth your time."
3,Review of marriage stats,"The reviewer before me mentioned some interesting statistics about married versus single men. The writer of the book used his statistics to sugest that for men's success getting married may be more important than college.I would like to say that correlation does not mean causation. Is it that married men get so much support from women when they are married that they are more likely to succeed? Or could it be that many women only want to marry successful men? My guess is that it is more the latter than the former. Men who are successful are more likely to find women that want to marry them. I have met many women who will blatenlly tell you that they hope to one day mary a rich and successful man. Most men desire to eventually get married. By this reasoning most men that are not married are not married because women thought they were not successful enough, or had to many emotional problems. Did getting married cause success, or did the probability of success cause marriage?"
4,"not bad, not bad at all","I just finished George Gilder's Men & Mariage, and I have to say that he makes a lot of good points. Since this is an updated version of his earlier Sexual Suicide, I would be interested in how much the statistics still need updating.Gilder highlights some of the elements that would substatiate the fact that gender roles and the traditional family are the key to a healthy culture. I agree to some extent, but I feel that it is better stated that the health of a society is gauged on fidelity to Scripture... gender roles and the traditional family being but an aspect of that larger issue.I enjoyed his style. He was just irreverent enough for me to laugh on occassion. All in all, I would have to recommend his book to others. Well done, George!"
5,Gladyce with a C,"This is the second book that I have read by this author. The first book was titled ""The Second Kiss"" and was truly wonderful. I have been patiently waiting for more books by Gayle Rogers. Finally Gladyce with a C is here. I have given it a definite 5 star rating on the entire content. I was especially impressed with the historical facts and dates. It seemed as though I was there participating in the action. The romance kept me so engrossed that I stayed up to 2:00 AM to finish it. The ending was perfect. Let's hear a lot more from Gayle Rogers. Lee Bielinski"
2,Lacked something,"The CD I had years ago seemed smoother and more ethereal and Celtic. Maybe my memory fails me but this recent CD seemed harsher with too much saxophone, too jazzy."
4,Iona - Impressive Debut,"Iona made their debut on to the world stage with this their first album in 1990. The original band was a trio comprised of Dave Bainbridge, Joanna Hogg, and Dave Fitzgerald. The three were augmented on this album by about a half dozen session players, one of whom, Troy Donnockley would eventually become a member of the band as well. The album contains several tracks that are still a part of the band's live show 20 years later including the killer instrumental ""Flight Of The Wild Goose"". Iona albums tend to have some filler to go along with the meat, but this one seems to be pretty lean all the way through. Hogg's vocals are pristine and Bainbridge's guitar soars on the rocking stuff like ""Trilogy"" and caress on the acoustic selections like ""Beijing"". I really like this album a lot and would rank it right near the top of the Iona catalogue."
2,Not the one...,"This is no ""Check it"". The instrumentals, with the syntheziers in there, are a bit grating. And Muta's delivery is not as interesting, the topics more insipid."
2,hard to press and hold 'on' button,You have to hold the button down and it is odd shaped and small. Not user friendly. I would not recommend to a friend.
4,Good buy,"I purchased this game for one of my nephews. he seems to be enoying it. I liked the appearance of it when it arrived and it seems like a good game to develop skills. I'm only guessing at the durability aspect but it seems sturdy enough to last as long as used appropiately. It is however not sturdy enough to withstand a more aggressive user. Given the age group it's targetted at, I'm guessing it won't be a toy to pass on to younger siblings."
3,They'll do.,"They're nice. We knew the quality to expect when getting a pair of earrings for less than $20 off the internet. We didn't expect them to be top-notch quality. While they are slightly different from each other, one is set a little higher than the other one, they are still pretty. They were meant as a just an extra Christmas present, so I'd rather keep them than go to the trouble of returning them. They arrived fast though. I'm rating this experience with 3 stars because they're good quality, just not exactly the same."
2,Delta band saw blade,had trouble with this blade as it didnit have blade set. Returned it once for a replacement and the second blade was in the same condition as the first. It appears th;at this was a bad manufacture that got through quality control.Handling of the returns was good.
1,Reader beware - this book is not what you might think it is.,"In recent years Matt Braun's westerns have been of top notch quality, but back in the early 1980s, he wrote a series of ""adult"" westerns under the pseudonym of Tom Lord. This is one of them. It is filled with page after page of explicit sex scenes that are both deviant and disgusting. The violence is also explicit. If you don't mind descriptions of brain matter being splattered left and right, you might be able to tolerate this book, but if you are a fan of the traditional kind of westerns the author has published under his own name before now, I think you will be shocked, to put it mildly. I do not believe I will ever read another book by Matt Braun."
3,good but not worth the price,The coffee was good. Worked fine in the Krups machine I have. It was just too expensive to make it worth while.
2,Sweatshirt,Item barely fit when I got it and then I washed it to take out the wrinkles and it SHRUNK REALLY BAD! Even in the arms where something doesn't normally shrink!
3,Forgotten history,This is a mostly true tale of black airmen who played an important role in WWII. Worth knowing about. Entertaining story too.
3,Very good TV movie,"Although it is very stagey and theatrical, and more than a little over-the-top in places, this is a first-rate tv drama with a great cast, a generally strong script, and passable period detail. What's missing are the aerial battles, which the budget didn't allow. It makes a good counterpoint to the feature film ""Red Tails"" (which has the battles) and the documentary ""Double Victory."" Definitely worth a watch."
5,History,"Again history rears its head, this is a keeper and the all star cast in this is outstanding. The couldn't have picked better actors that this."
5,Well worth it,"My father was one of the men who were depicted in this movie. I thought it was well worth watching, it will be a legacy to pass on to my children, thanks to the well acted script."
4,"""Red Tails"" it is not, but this movie still has good history in it","I took my Dad an Air Corps WW II Vet to see ""Red Tails"" at the show. I told him about this movie and he had not seen it so I got it for him. We made notes on how this movie spent more time on the flight school then jumped over their early days in the war where Red Tails spent more time. It is worth seeing both movies again with a Vet to get their war stories before they are gone."
4,Excellent male role models!,"I used this movie for a Citizenship Group for adolescent boys with serious conduct and self-esteem issues. They not only watched it, but they were excited about the fact that the movie was based on real-life. Several have asked to have it shown again soon. I highly recommend it, especially for minority kids and adults."
4,Black pilots fly in WWll!,"This fictional movie related to the true historical contributions by the 1st WWll fighter pilots and the obstaclesthey conquered in the air. Their superior actions led to the end of racial discrimination in the U.S. Military.A story that needed to be told, and a fun movie to watch. Very entertaining. Applause to Amazon for making this film available."
4,Good story,HBO's telling of the trials and triumphs of the Tuskegee airmen is far superior to the Red Tails one that was in theaters. This one has a much more rounded out plot and while I like the actors in both the ones in this version give it more heart. I will say that the dogfight scenes in Red Tails were better but this is overall a better film.
1,Tastes Like Dirt,I know Ginseng teas can have an earthy flavor and I have tried a few different brands but this one just tastes like dirt. Not a good flavor and it gets stronger the longer is sits.
2,Default Review Title of Spam,"The shows are cool (because the special effects and plot lines are ultra-cheesy and because they demonstrate a complete lack of knowledge of even the most basic concepts of astronomy), but there are only four of them, and, worst of all, the last one is the first half of a to-be-continued episode. In other words, not a very good collection."
1,Not What I wanted,I didn't see where it was described as all instrumental - no lyrics - except for one song - in Spanish.I never would have purchased this - I wanted Maria Elena - with words - - in Enlish.
5,Music hath charm to soothe the savage breast,"I have listened to guitar all my life and heard a lot of great music. However, the music of Los Indios Tabajaras is ,unquestionably, the most exqusite I have ever heard.I don't know anything about the composition of music butI like what I hear. There are only a few who have the gift of being able to talk to many through their music.Los Indios are among that favored few.Thank God for C.D.s so that this genius will not be lost to future generations."
5,thrilled,"All of the sudden, after years of obscurity and neglect, there's a buzz about Grant Tracy Saxon. As a veteran (now retired) swinger, I can tell you that his books were once considered gospel in certain circles. No one was more disappointed than I when AIDS and the '80s swept in, and dozens of important books like ""Making Love"" went out of print. So I was obviously surprised when, looking his book up on a whim, I found that other Amazon customers remember GTS, and are still finding his books as useful and life-changing as I did in the early '70s. Clearly, someone should be thinking about a new edition - maybe even a Grant Tracy Saxon omnibus - I think he still has a lot to teach us."
4,miss the snaps!,Loved the cap as it worked well but I really miss the snaps! The velcro always pulls my hair no matter how careful I am!
5,Great novel!,"This novel has it all - history, romance, deeds of daring, and dastardly villains. This is definitely one of my all-time favorites - this is the sort of book you'll want to re-read over and over again. It covers the period when the Turks were running rampant in Hungary, which is seldom described in English-language history books, so the setting itself is exotic for that very reason; an American reader will be biting his/her nails till the last page to see how it all turns out. I give it five stars without any hesitation."
1,A Book to Avoid!!,The author makes a cottage industry of WW I East Front books it appears. None of any quality or scholarship. This is a book - like his others - to avoid.
5,oh dad poor dad mamma's hung you in the closet,"I really love this movie. It's a true cult movie, if you enjoy dark humor, black comedies, and have and off-beat sense what's funny, you too will find this a good choice to add to your library."
4,This is a good concert.,"If you love 70`s Soul music, you will love this concert. It contains some of my favorite groups from out of the past."
5,SOUL,"OMG... TAKES YOU BACK IN TIME. I'VE WATCHED IT OVER AND OVER AND MY FRIENDS REALLY ENJOYED IT WHEN THEY CAME OVER. IN FACT, THEY ARE GETTING THEIR OWN!!!"
3,dis-satisified,"I received this item in a timely manner and in good condition, but the scale was lost in the vast box in which it was packaged.I live in the carribbean and i ordered the scale through a sky box address. To receive the package,you have to pay duties on the cost of the package and the freight(from Maimi to my country) which can either be weight or dimensional shipping, whichever one is larger.I payed three times the value of the scale in duties, due to the incredible package."
1,Don't buy this scale,"This scale is extremely inaccurate--it fluctuates wildly. I always stand in the same place on the scale. I can weigh myself three consecutive times in the exact same place on the scale and get three different readings.I bought this scale because other users gave it a great review. If you are looking for accuracy, buy something else."
2,Wanted to keep track of weight and water readings!! It wasn't possible!,"I had a completely dissapointing experience with TANITA. The feature to register your current age, height, and sex is only to calculate the IMC, fat and water percentage, but this scale doesn't store anything. You've got to register manually in a workbook using Excel or something like that to keep track and follow your improvement. My wife was angry because she could not retrived her last reading at all. Therefore I was convinced that it was't a good idea after all."
1,very inaccurate,"Reads a different percentage every time you step on it. No consistency at all. I havent used it since the first week. You can weigh yourself, step off, and weigh yourself again, and it may vary by as much as 9 percennt.Dont waste your money on this scale."
4,until the end,"Subject is very well covered and gave you the feel of what the charactors had to live with during this war. Because the book covers brothers on both side of the war you get the feeling that neither side is going to win, which in fact is what really happened."
3,The real Peter & Gordon,"First off, I really do love Peter & Gordon. I just think it's a shame that they never had a hit with one of their own songs. As I was listening to this cd, whenever a track sounded extra good I'd look to see what the title was and saw it was one they wrote themselves. Peter & Gordon never needed to sing anyone elses songs because it was their own that really shined in my opinion. That bothers me, mainly because there are so few. On this cd out of 23 songs, 7 were theirs. Pay attention to ""Don't Pity Me"" and ""Hurtin' Is Lovin'"" and you'll see what I mean. The harmonies and string arrangment on Hurtin' are so haunting, I've been hearing it for days.Overall this is still a great album."
1,Parts do not fit together.,"A very lowsy product. Instructions fail to explain how the pieces fit together. A sturdy tabletop, but the legs can't be attached to it. Another lousy Chinese made product."
2,Have Heard Better,"I was disappointed with the quality of the recording on this CD. I used to have just about every record by this artist and honestly I think the records had better sound than some of these transferred to CD. His music is good, but I expected a better sound now that they have it on disc. I have other CDs I have bought to replace albums that have been fantastic, this wasn't one of them."
2,"Mediocre, at best","This is mediocre at best. A few bright spots, but mostly flat pop and effluent. I should have simply downloaded the songs I wanted."
5,B.J. Thomas Greatest Hits,We went to see B. J. in Renfro Valley Ky and it refreshed our memory of him and his great mmusic so ordered this and we are delighted by the songs and music. Sounds great and has really great songs on it. We recommend this to any folks of the over the hill type who remember this type of music and for the younger generation who have never experienced the greart music we had growing up.
5,Yummy Yummy Yummy Yummy! Packed well & shipped fast ~,"I will definately be ordering from them again very soon. I love the fact that I can use my Amazon Gift Certificates to buy them. Reminds me of when I was little and my father would by bushels for the hwole family and wed all sit outside and pig out. -Sincerely, MJ Hinderliter"
4,more than a title,"L'Infinitamente Piccolo is more than a title, it is a personal investment of the author to share with the audience the celebration of the Christianism in the world. With the theme of St Franscis the author shares the jurney of St Francis within europa. He also brings aditional voices such like the onces from I Muvrini (Corsica) and Madredeus (Portugal) but also has included a composition from Ennio Morricone (the of Mission). The author is the one who becomes the 'infinitamente picolo' to share a monent of reflexion on live, faith and beauty."
3,It's all about colour and there isn't any...,"I don't care that this is an exact reproduction of the pre-1923 book and not optically character recognized. The 4th word in the title is Colour. I get the Nomenclature part (2nd word) but where's the colour? If it's text only, the description should say so.The concept is delicious-- a uniform way of naming colours and then giving examples of the colour in the animal, vegetable and mineral worlds. #64 Wax yellow is the color of the larvae of large water beetle (animal), the greenish parts of nonpareil apple (vegetable), the colour of a semi opal (mineral).So this is for scholars I guess and people who really know color or for poets looking for odd mentions (anthers of saffron crocus; wings of goldfinch canary bird) Probably I can't afford a repro (or an OCR) of whatever edition has the colours but I'll keep an eye out for it."
5,Can't Wait to Find the Time to Read it!,"Since I am by nature a curious person and love input and intellection the INTERNET is my ""Knowledge/Info PIMP"". I wonder how it is altering me and this book seems like it examines these and other issues from a philosophical viewpoint, which is how I need my paradigms challenged. However, walking the talk (unplugging even with purpose) will be a challenge!!!"
1,Dead On Arrival,"Installed the batteries, set it up, selected my ""personal key"" and stepped on the scale. It cycled through the settings then read ""Error"", as if it was stuck in set-up mode. Never worked once. This product has serious quality problems as well as the accuracy issues raised by other reviewers. Buy something else."
4,I love this scale but the body fat function is a little shoddy,"This scale is accurate when it comes to weight. Although, my body fat seems to fluctuate a lot throughout the day. Some days its 19% others it 23% I'm not sure how accurate that is, but I mean, I guess my body fat is pretty low? Besides that the scale is great. I love that I can see when I've gained a few ounces so that I can get myself back on track before I gain a pound or two."
2,Quality Price should mean a product that lasts,"I bought the Tanita BC-534 less than 3 years ago. Now, it won't even turn on, with new batteries and everything. They are charging a premium price for a cheap scale. I would not buy another scale from them."
1,not to happy,"puchased the scale on Saturday night, Monday morning only the weight part works, the other features indicate error. Called the factory and a rep called me with some useless checking information. Followed the instructions and it still does not work. The rep tells me I have to package the scale and send back to factory at my cost. I am not very happy when you buy a high-end scale and two days later you have to send back for repairs and pay for the freight. Last time I purchase any products of this brand"
1,Don't waste your money,"This scale does not measure body fat accurately, period! What a waste of my time and money. I am a personal trainer and have access to $2000 body fat analyzer and state of the art skin fold calipers. This... whatever you want to call it... is junk.I am 44 years of age, highly athletic, and measure anywhere from 9%-10% body fat depending on who does the testing and what device is used. Today, after purchasing this... whatever you want to call it... I magically turned obese, weighing in at 26% body fat.Male, Female, athletic, standard, mode 1-3, doesn't make a bit of difference... this scale gets it wrong. Total junk."
1,I am sad with this purchase.,"When I received the product came with problems since I calculate of corporal fat does not visualize it, does not work. Try to obtain aid and they never could solve them. I am sad with this purchase. And desire my money or a good product."
2,Pretty useless,"I thought from the title of this one that I was going to get 73 specific ideas for employee communications. Instead I got squishy and obvious advice like ""know your audience,"" ""avoid typos,"" ""listen to NRP,"" and ""read 'Elements of Style.'"" Duh! This book might help someone straight out of school, though I doubt it. The author keeps saying we should write as if our audience were a 12 year old kid. Well, that's how this book is written, which doesn't do me a lot of good."
4,This book's a ... (that's a good thing),"... Its small size, spiral binding, plain vanilla typography, and crude drawings said this was a silly, lightweight, even childish work. WRONG. It's filled with lots of good pointers -- succinctly put & engagingly written. Shannon blends hard info & clear opinions with easy commentary & light humor. But, the mustard yellow & black color scheme doesn't do it justice, and the illustrations detract. As one interested in communications generally, I found this book surprisingly helpful."
5,"Clear, practical and most of all helpful","It is always nice when a book delivers against its title, and this one does. The advice is simple, straight-foward and most important easy to implement immediately."
5,Delta 50-345 Universal Mobile Base,"I have two, one for my 14"" bandsaw and one for my 6"" jointner. Each took about two hours to assemble not counting prepping the wood. I glued up and biscuit joined 3/4"" hard wood scraps and then planed to the 1"" square. I like the three wheel design on the relatively light machines as it makes it easier to navigate in my small workshop. I find the bases sturdy and provide a very stable base for working. While total prep and assembly may take longer because of the wood, finale result and lower cost offset the inconvenience."
4,Nice Product,"I just assembled this base for use with an 18"" Jet band saw. I was attracted to the product for a number of reasons:1)Price: to me, $100 to $200 for a mobile base, for the amount I am going to move this saw is too much. Maybe if I rolled it out every time I was going to use it I would feel differently.2)Customized size: Given that the rails are made from the wood of my choosing, I new that the final size would be perfect. I was not sure that this would be the result of other universal mobile bases not specific to the tool being used.I concluded a couple of things now that I have used the product:1) It takes longer than you think to put it together.2) The instructions are a little vague, but not bad. The order of assembly was not to my choosing.3) My band saw is very tall. The third wheel design makes for a pretty unstable object when raised onto the wheel. Be careful!4) Oak is moderately expensive. I spent about $15.00 on wood for the rails. Factor this into your cost."
3,Some assembly required.,"The directions are pretty bad, the photos almost useless. Leveling feet will probably need to be counterbored (not mentioned in the directions). For my contractor style table saw it works pretty well, but for my 6"" jointer it doesn't stay up in the rolling position when you try to move it. The milling of parts (stamping, actually) is pretty weak too. The holes in the wood needed to be reamed out several times to get the bolts through, because the holes in the metal brackets don't line up square. They're useable now, but they took much more time to assemble than I had anticipated. A few simple fixes and a new set of directions are all that are needed drastically improve the quality of this product. I'm disappointed."
4,A nice solution....,"I have most of my shop on wheels now. On this base I have a Delta 14"" bandsaw with riser block, a router cabinet, a drill press and I'm planning to put a Powermatic 60B 8"" jointer on one. I used galvanized square extruded steel stock instead of wood. It was cheaper but just a little too wide for the bolts to fully thread through the mobile base and the struts. So I have bought new bolts that were a little longer than what Delta supplied. The bandsaw is pretty stable in motion. I was concerned that it would be likely to tip over but its fine. The drill press is a benchtop model on a cabinet so its fine in motion as well. Not sure yet if the base can handle the weight of the jointer but I think it should be ok. Anyway - these bases are a nice solution to a crowded shop."
5,A great product.,"I am a BEGINNING woodworker, and it only took about two pain free hours to put this base together flawlessly. A stop at Lowes (the hardware superchain with the blue and white logo, in case the name is removed), and I had the 2 x 2 x 36 inch oak struts (finished size 1 1/2 x 1 1/2 x 36) that I needed right off the shelf for about half of the cost of the base itself. The unit levels perfectly and rolls effeortlessly. It stays where it belongs even though my shop calls for the base's movement to be in the same direction as my cuts. It will move if you push real hard, but this is more due to the fact that it is presently on polished floors than anything else. On a concrete floor I do not believe it would budge. The base is absolutely steady. And, if you ever need to use it for another machine, all you'll need is to either recut the existing wood, or get new wood. As I stated, a great product."
2,No minimum size listed,"I purchased this for my jointer, but after setting all the pieces together on my bench, I realized the smallest width it could be was 16"". My jointer measures 12"". I had to put a plywood base into the finished framework to set the jointer on. I have the HTC mobil base and for now on thats what I will purchace. As with the other reviewers, It's sloppy with the 1 1/2"" boards. The back roller run on the outside edges because of the slop. They tell you to drill 7/16"" holes and that is way to big. For those of you that don't have a drill press, you need to mark both sides of the boards and drill from both sides. This will give you a more accurate hole. I am verry dissapointed with this mobil base."
4,Very good........But,This Mobile Base does a fine job of moving equipment. The only drawback is letting the base down to the floor after use. There is not enough length on the foot lever forward of the hinge point. The base drops rather abruptly to the floor. I extended the lever with a length of hardwood and can now lower the base smoothly and softly.
5,The Single Foot Pedal Makes This A Winner,"I like the design of the single foot pedal which makes this mabile base easier to use than the HTC 2000 model. The HTC design requires two foot pedals to operate while the Delta has only one. The foot pedal is also larger on the Delta while the HTC design has rather thin ones. The single wheel also seems to make the Delta model easier to pivot with.If you want a mobile base that's ready to go out of the box, the HTC model will serve your needs well enough. If you can or don't mind making the rails yourself, get the Delta model since its easier to raise and lower with its larger foot pedal, and the single wheel design also makes it easier to pivot with."
2,Annoying,"I have two of these mobile bases and an HTC mobile base. I prefer the HTC because the foot lever on the Delta protrudes into the shop walking area and causes a tripping hazard. I've tripped over them many times and tehy get in the way when I use the tools. The foot actuated operation is nice(although it tips the tool at angle uncomfortably far from vertical) but in my small shop, I need all the real estate I can get. I plan to replace the Deltas with HTCs when I can afford it. The HTC base uses two locking knobs to keep the wheels from moving while the tool is in use. It's less convenient than a foot lever, but it works well."
2,Great idea but......,"I think these would be great for lighter homeowner type tools or tools that are somewhat light to start with such as drill presses and band saws. I actually purchased it for a Rockwell cabinet saw. The saw is simply to heavy for the light weight metal these are made out of. However, I like the concept so well that one of these days I might just go to the metal yard and get some steel tubing and weld up something a bit more stout for the saw. I will probably take this and use it on some other machine. So my recommendation would be it is OK for a contractor type table saw but not a light industrial iron table saw, jointer, or planer."
4,Great Option,"This mobile base makes moving my Delta saw so easy it should be outlawed. Seriously, all you have to do is step on the pedal to lift the saw & push or pull it anywhere you want it to be. As long as your floor is smooth you can move the saw with one hand. I have a Delta tablesaw with a cast iron top and wings and without this little jewel, I would need two men to wrestle it around my shop."
4,Mobile stand works great.,"I am using this under a Old Delta Bandsaw (they really do last forever) that is sitting on a homemade base. The base is plenty solid, but needed wheels to be more convienient.I spent a about three hours cutting the oak pieces and assembling this. When done, the end product is a custom fit base that works very well. It rolls easily, yet is rock solid when set down for use. Delta has a great three wheel design, same as on their made to fit bases, simple and works a treat."
3,Good but could be a lot better!,"Should copy the one offered by Rockler. It has an easily removable jack wheel that can be removed in about 10-15 seconds to get it out of the way and/or used on another mobile base. This could reduce the overall cost if one needs more than one base. There could be a little more attention paid to the manufacture so that the holes line up better, and there is a small problem with the bends not allowing it to all be at 90 degrees to the bottom and consequently the when the lumber is inserted, it is not square and plumb to the adjacent piece. The instructions SUCK, but they shouldn't be needed for any intelligent person. If you can't put it together without the instructions, you probably should not plug in any of your power tools."
5,Alternative for cross members,"Some people have suggested using common fir studs, ripped to 1 1/2 by 1 1/2 in lieu of the recommended hardwood to save money. Another suggested reinforcing the cross piece that supports the stepped caster with angle iron.I haven't been able to find 1 1/2 square hardwood in the home depot, but 1 1/2 by 3/4 finished oak is about 79 cents per foot. Why not glue two strips together? This should be just as strong, and somewhat less expensive."
2,Delta Mobile Base,"the product was made in China, which explains it's quality control problem. The design is good, but Delta is not watching it's suppliers close enough. The main problem was the assembly hardware was a mix of Standard bolts and metric nuts. In a couple of cases a specific bolt would be standard and its matching nut would be metric. I would probably not buy this product again."
4,Delta Mobile Base,It is a great unit but would even be better if you supplied four pieces of steel tubing. ( 36 in.)?
3,WAY too much trouble,"I have to say that this product actually works fine once you get it together, but boy what a lot of difficulty. The pieces are bent steel, but the bends aren't ninety degrees, really, and this complicates assembly needlessly. I had to grind sloppy welds in a couple places just to get the pieces of wood in place. I bought them because I feel the three wheel design is the best for ease of use, but I wouldn't buy them again. Hopefully, some other company will make a three wheeled base (one foot operation and easier pivoting) without the necessity of drilling so much (20 holes per base and a lot of marking etc.)"
3,Okay but not great!,"I do not have experience with the other universal unit but it certainly has to be a better deal. First,Delta did not supply enough nuts and bolts. Disappointing because ... they certainly could afford it! Second, adding the ... cost of the oak for the rails this is a very expensive unit! Quality is fine. But quality control i.e. missing bolts is poor."
4,too short screws,i have several of these bases for my machinery. this most recent base has shorter bolts that do not leave enough thread to draw in the nut over the wood cross pieces. you will have to use a clamp to squeeze the channel shut in order to get enough nut threaded to tighten it up. . not using the clamp will likely result in stripping the bolt. another 1/4 inch longer on the bolts and it would be like it used to be: easy.
3,good grief bolts too short,"This product will be fine in the long run but good grief. Someone's not paying attention to the details. The carriage bolts which are used to mount the user supplied frame pieces must span 1-11/16 inches which is the O.D. on the metal corner frames. The supplied bolts, which were advertised as 2"" in the assembly instructions were actually 1-7/8"". These very soft nuts and bolts stripped out threads because I could only get a bite on a little over an eighth of an inch of the bolt. As you can imagine, this made for a maddening assembly process and a trip to the hardware store"
3,50-345 Universal mobile base,"Reading other reviews I decided to use 1.5"" angle iron instead of wood. I had heard that the wood was not strong enough. The only problem I have had is getting the pivot bracket to work correctly. The rest of the base is just fine. I'm having trouble with the Pivot bracket to lock in place. It's probable something I'm doing wrong. Other than that it's a good product. I am using the mobile base for my Delta 10"" contractors table saw, it's a heavy saw that's another reason way I used angle iron instead of wood."
4,Shop on wheels !!,"The Delta mobile kit does the job. Just a push of the lever, and your are moving 300 pounds across the floor. Can easily rearrange the shop in seconds. A drill press is must to put the base together. Did not bother to use hard wood for smaller equipment...ripped some pt for the the rails. Instructions for assembly need improvement....don't drill the extra hole in the ends of the rails!! Careful with the clip the secures the hinge for the foot lever..it will fly across the room if it slips out of your pliers during installation...tough little bugger to find."
4,An interim publication,"The Collected Poems has superseded this edition, which was put together in those early days when Ted and Olwyn Hughes were figuring out how to present Plath's work. The slim volume itself, however, in hard cover format, is wonderful to hold--at least for those who still value that kind of experience. Plath scholar Judith Kroll explains in the latest edition of her landmark book, CHAPTERS IN A MYTHOLOGY, the drama of editing and publishing Plath after her death."
3,The Calm Before the Storm,Crossing the Water seems very much like the calm before the storm of Ms. Plath's Ariel. I enjoyed seeing where Sylvia was just prior to Ariel and her path Crossing the Water over to something much more startling. Like all her poetry I am still reading and trying to understand but I'm glad I purchased it if only to see her step over into the next phase.
1,"Read the description, don't look at the picture!","I am very unhappy with this purchase and returned it. The picture shows the black and color cartridges, beware you will only receive the black cartidge. Amazon needs to get them to update the photo to only show one black cartridge."
2,too small for pro's!,"Good looks, but not the bag for a pro. Not padded well, comfortable or ready for production elements. Better ti use for a day bag with your single body cam and a trip to Disneyland. Take this thing international and your in trouble!"
3,GREAT SONG SELECTION,"I am a big fan of Dalene's and was pleased to find this. The song selection is great. It's a very short CD with only 10 songs.I had never heard of Lani Groves before but she has a good voice and does well (especially on Turn Back The Hands of Time)but up against Darlene's power and emotion it's hard not notice the difference. Darlene singing ""I'll Be There"" is really great. Lani does a nice job on ""Rescue Me' but I was hopeing this would be a song that Darlene covered. It's perfect for her.A nice addition to my Darlene Love collection but for the uninitiated start with the Darlene Love Antholgy or Best of stuff that she did with Spector."
4,Volume 2 of the 3 volume set,"This is the second in a three set history of the Civil War, well written by Shelby Foote. The coverage is from the horrific Union defeat at Fredericksburg in late 1862 to Sherman's raid on Meridian, ending with Ulysses Grant's accession to Lieutenant General.The following major battles and events are covered here: Fredericksburg, Vicksburg, Gettysburg, Chancellorsville, Brandy Station, Meridian, Murfreesboro (Stone's River), Chickamauga, Chattanooga, and so on. The warfare became even bloodier than the combat covered in the first volume.All in all, another successful venture by Foote into Civil War history, made accessible to a general public."
3,Bad mechanics,"While providing a complete history, Foote's prose is unnecessarily dense and his run-on sentences and over-use of parenthetical phrases makes the narrative exceedingly difficult to follow."
3,pillows okay,Very nice pillows -only the colour is really bright (a lot brighter than photo shows). I was expecting a soft green and got an almost flourescent green so I am not thrilled with the colour. I wish the less brighter colours were in stock. Navy/beige would be my preference. Get more stock in AMAZON!
3,Disappointed,"I'm a huge chocolate fan, and I've eaten lots of different brands, ranging from the lower-end Lindt and Ghirardelli to the higher-end Valrhona and Neuhaus. I was frankly disappointed by the taste of this bar, which ended up being extremely dull for a very high cacao content bar. Even Ghirardelli's 100% cacao baking bar had a more exciting fruity flavor. The only redeeming quality of this bar is that it melts extremely smoothly and makes a really thick melting chocolate, which is good for those bakers and candy-makers out there. Not really great for tasting alone."
5,A breath of fresh air,"Container Gardening is a breath of fresh air. Paul Williams enthusiastic and energetic writing style,when combined with such fantastic photographs is truly inspiring. Having read all of his books, you understand Paul Williams is a man who really loves plants and understands how to make a garden work. He has an amazing ability to pass on his knowledge in an informative and motivating style. As a young gardener, Container Gardening is one of the best purchases i have ever made and is a cracking book."
5,Loved the story,This doesn't seem like the old Stephen King novels to me. I really loved the story though. It's slow in places but he develops the story. You truly feel the struggle of this woman who lost her husband - someone she was very much in love with. I like the ordinary life turned extraordinary twist. It's wonderful and uplifting. I truly was entertained by the book.
2,I just can't get into it,"I have been waiting to read this book for a while and I was so excited when I got it in the mail. I eagerly opened the book and read page one, then I read page one, then I read page one. I kid you not, I read page one 3 times. I have made it to about page 50 and I can't get past the smucking, as someone else has mentioned.I am a HUGE King fan and always have been but I put this one down in favor of Blaze. I just started it tonight and have already read more of it in one evening than I did of Lisey in 3 days combined.Please someone tell me it will get better and that there is a reason for me to pick it up again!I love his books like Thinner, Desperation, Insomnia, Gerald's Game, but there are a few that are just slow and leave me terribly disappointed in my favorite author!"
5,ONE WORD: MAGNIFICENT,"You will have to read the book before this review will make any sense, but for those who have read the book and enjoyed it, you'll know exactly what I'm saying. Reading this book was in and of itself a bool hunt, and each chapter a station of the bool. And the reward at the end of the bool hunt? Why, it's the beauty of the book itself and the amazing experience of having read it. Every time I picked up the book I felt as if I had been transported to Boo'ya Moon. It is no exaggeration that this book has affected me like no other, written by Stephen King or otherwise. Its magic has lingered long after finishing it (which sadly I had to do)."
4,Holler Me Home,"I picked this one up when it first came out in paperback. After Cell, I was ready for another crazy ride. Unlike Cell however, I found it very hard to get into this one when I first started it in April. I put it down and moved on to other things. I came back to Lisey's Story in the days before the release of Duma Key, and it was like reading a different book from the first attempt. I thought this was a really great story and enjoyable read."
2,Should have stopped,"Stephen King, who has been one of my favorite authors since ""Carrie,"" should have kept his promise to write no more books. This was incredibly boring. His son's book (Joe Hill's ""The Heart-Shaped Box"") was marginally more interesting."
1,The King of junk,"I used to love King's books, but lately I do not even recognize these books as King ones. They are the most rehashed and drab pieces of junk on the planet. Steven King obviously has run out of new ideas, and is just trying to make more money. What a total joke. Anyone who likes this book is just kidding themselves, because they do not want to admit that King sucks now. I am at least willing to be honest with myself and deal with it. Its time to go find a new author to read."
1,Disappointing and boring,I wish I had never purchased this book. I always buy every new book that he writes as soon as it comes out. I wish I hadn't this time. I am so disappointed.
3,Agree With Others - NOT his best,"I'll be blunt and brief, since I've got better things to do. King wrote a good love story here, not a horror story. The last good horror he wrote was way before his accident (thoughCellcomes close). It could have been much shorter and it really bothered me having to read ""smucking"" every page or so. Who really talks like that? Not that it would have been better for Lisey to curse, but smucking? Come on!A good book by a great author, but certainly not his best. His earlier work seems better (with the exception of hisThe Dark Towerseries), more scary. Not that King is slipping in telling a story, but he should just quit tagging everything with ""horror"" on it, especially if it only has a few scares in it."
4,great book,"I was so glad this turned out to be a good book. Since I was disappointed by the Cell, I was really looking forward to a good old fashioned King spookfest, and I got it with this book. It is also a love story which is part of what makes it so spooky. But the story is mostly about the relationships that people develop after spending many years with each other. Not just married people, but family too. It makes you think about how people take each other for granted. This is an awesome book, one I'm sure I will read again because I enjoyed the story so much."
4,I'm back on the King bandwagon,"I've been reading Stephen King books for over 20 years and I've been relatively disappointed by his more recent works (other than his finally finished ""Dark Tower"" series). With ""Lisey's Story"", I've fallen back in love with King's incredible story-telling. This is a can't-put-down book; you'll race to the end and then be sorry when you get there because you want the story to keep going. The characters are rich andwell-developed and mostly likeable (which is something that's been lacking in some of King's other recent novels). If you're a long time fan or just like a good story, read this one."
1,BOR-ING,"What a snooze of a book. I am all for branching out into new things, but Christ, this story had no point. If it hadn't had King's name on it, this novel would have flunked the 100 page test. Put this next to Eyes of the Dragon in the sell bin and try to forget about it."
4,"Abide, there is a reward","There is a level of work here. Frustrating,detailed, step by step. But the man is a master. He has things to say. And we have learned to listen. And some of us have seen the monster herein described. And have had no escape. And there is a prize."
3,A Big Smucking Review,"I bought this book on a whim because I needed something to read.I wish I hadn't.Lisey's Story is all about The Widow Landon as she sorts through her husband's crap after his death.I can't really remember what causes her to start her journey to Boo'Ya Moon, her husband's other world.What really annoyed me was her and Scott's inner language, such as ""bool"" ""Smucking"" ""puffickly hoo-yuge"" etc...That's always annoyed me about King's work; the way he inserts weird little sayings like that into his work.Other than that, It was alright."
3,What's Up With Stephen?,"Like so many others, I am a longtime Stephen King fan, although I have to say up front that I liked the early ones better than the later ones.This is a readable book that engages you with its storyline. However, this seems to be written by a peculiarly angry and misogynistic King. Yes, his main character is a woman, but the language of the book and the treatment of this woman is harsher than I have previously encountered (maybe he got this way with his characters after I strayed from his books?). I am not referring to character behavior (he can make his characters as unlikeable as he pleases) but the narrative and plot as written by King. Maybe he is not interested in female readership? I almost came back, but...no thanks. I require a little more respect for my gender from my authors."
5,grabbed my imagination all the way through,"I was entranced by the book ... not wanting to put it down to attend to other matters (oh like eating a meal.) As to the negative comments about having phrases that a family would use that mean nothing to others... like YEAH. My family does... I thought all families did.... guess not..I wonder if the readers who found this book lacking in some ways, have some amazingly different approach to reading than I do? Yeah... I am sure of that. I enjoyed this book and it grabbed my imagination all the way through."
2,Big disappointment,"As a true fan of Stephen King I look forward to every new publication. I think he he truly one of the greatest writers of all time, but this story was really slow and boring. Instead of reading the book I listened to the audio version on CD. I was not impressed with Mare Willingham's reading (I kept visualizing Ms. Willingham instead of Lisey telling the story). King can write stories that are both endearing and chilling...this was neither."
2,So far I had to force myself to get to page 140.,"This book is incessantly repetitious without a forward thrust. The language is geared to a ten year old. (Bool, anybody?) Add a few dashes of misogyny (e.g. Lisey gets a phone call warning her she'll be cut up in a very delicate place) and you have a miserable reading experience. At one time, Mr. King was underrated by the critics. Now it is the other way around. This whole opening section (the 140 pages) could have been cut down to 20 without any character or plot loss. Lisey's Endless Story is only a necessity for die-hard King fans."
1,Dreadful,"I am a King apologist. I have defended him for years, even after the cop out ending of the Dark Tower series.This however is the only book i've started but not finished. The whole 'smucking' thing made my flesh crawl, it was emotion by numbers.I sincerely hope this was a one off but there seems to be a trend occurring. 'Cell' was readable, just.What happened to the boy who wrote The Stand?Sobriety killed the muse?Wouldn't be the first time."
3,Lisey's a bit slow,"Of course it's well written. It's King. BUT if you are an avid King reader as I am, you well know that some of his books are a bit slow and you just have to bear with them. Lisey's Story is a good book but if you want your eyes to stay riveted to the pages, go read The Dark Tower Series."
3,Stephen King- Lisey's story,This was NOT Mr. king's best book- the story dragged and didn't have that 'invisible yarn' that keeps a story flowing. The deceased character was very interesting- too bad his wife isn't.
2,We love ya Steve but.......,"Like many others, I've read all of Mr. Kings books and will continue to do so but, I sure wish I'd of gotten this one at a discount instead of paying full price. This book is just plain uninteresting. The Stand and most of his other stories leave the reader in awe at the way Mr. King can turn a phrase and/or weave a tale but this one feels like the ""Anti-King"" must of taken over! The wordplay is childish and the plot is....well what plot? Sorry Mr. King, as a fellow Mainer I promise to keep the faith though!"
1,I agree with Flying Vee,"Thanks to Flying Vee for her (1 star) review which says it more eloquently than I could.What happened, Stephen????"
1,You've got to be kidding!,"I'm sorry, guys, but this is the WORST Stephen King book I have ever read, and I have read all of them. Some I liked, some I didn't, but I truly disliked this one! I totally agree with all the readers who say this book was a chore to get through. I really think King's accident affected him more than he realizes. This book is filled with meaningless words - and SO MANY OF THEM! It was like he was paid by the word, and when he ran out of real words, he made some up! I want the old Stephen King back...the guy who could chill you and thrill you with each page. THAT Stephen King did not write this book...an imposter did. We've been ""booled!"" Don't waste your money."
2,Sloooooow!!!,I just never could get into this as hard as I tried. It was slow and Lisey is more than a little irritating.
2,love and horror,"Well, the least you can say is that this book is different from the other books that Stephen King has written so far.The story of Lisey Landon, wife of author Scott Landon, is a kind of a horror and love story in one. A strange combination, but that's just the way it is. I have no other words to describe it. Two years after her husband died, Lisey wants to get rid of Scott's possessions and that's what it's all about. A lot of flashbacks show that there marriage has been successfull, but also scary at times, and so on, and so on, ...It takes way too long before something happens and when you finally get interested, the story is over. I'm a big fan of Stephen King, but this is clearly not what I want to read from him. Too long and too much of the same. Chance wasted !"
2,Thank GOD !!!! I am done with it !,"Yes folks! I've done it! I have read every single page of Lisey's Story by Stephen King, one of my favorite author... If you go through the reviews about this book, you will see that I'm not the only one who had a hard time finishing Lisey's Story. The book seems ENDLESS! The story is weird although the main idea of a writer's widow on a psychological quest about his husband demons is not completely silly. The first hundred pages are horrible, boring and hard to follow. Numerous flashbacks and a secret language between Lisey and her husband brings the reading to a high level of subtility. If this is your first ""King"" please do not rate the author on the basis of your appreciation of this book! Check for his early era writings, most of them are great reads and page-turners.If the book would have been 300 pages shorter, maybe I would have given it 3-4 stars for writing quality and originality. But obiously King was taken away in a weird autobiographical phase !"
5,stay with it,"I had a hard time at first staying with this story I put it down 3 times (not a good sign)I like books that grab me from the first few pages at least an most S.K. novels do,not so this story but I had it so stuck with it and I can say I am glad I did!!By page 200 he had me and I didn`t stop reading until I was done not his very best but I `m not sorry I bought it"
5,I smucking love it!,"I am going to make this simple. This book is about love. If you did not like Bag of Bones you most likely not like this book. Lisley is struggling to cope with the unexpected death of her husband. In her struggle to cope she dealt a few hard knocks. Lisley often flashes back to earlier times in her marriage. There is a lot of depth in this novel. I know there are some avid fans who really did not like or get this book. If your married or in a long term relationship this book is not hard to understand. I found this book to be one of Sai King's finest works and I could not put it down. My suggestion if you loved Insomnia,Blaze or Bag of Bones then you will adore this book. This is not a romance novel, it is about unconditional love and loss. Bool ! The End!"
3,"Good, but not among the best!","In this book we get to know Lisey. A woman who`s mind wanders in thoughts of her deceased husband. Stephen King does a superb job of letting us get to know their long lost relationship; thoughts and everyday gestures between a couple deeply in love. As the story travels forward, her memories and the world of her husbands meanstreak comes back to her.This escalates into something beyond this world...I was a little disappointed when I finished reading this book. Mainly because I wanted more of King`s bad- gunky (for those who have read the book!) fantasies. But as a combination between love, horror and fantasy stories; it ain`t bad."
3,Potential to be a good one,"I nearly put down and gave up on this novel several times.Any other author, I would have but I slogged through this one.If King and his editor cut out about 1/3 of the pages,you would have the makings of a typical great King story.Even though the story was a good one and at times enjoyable,""Lisey's Story"" was a burden to read."
3,Disappointed,"All I can say is that I was very disappointed. I struggle with this question the last couple of his books. Is it because he is Stephen King and I know his past books are fantastic that I go into expecting a lot? If it was a unknown author would I have liked it more? Or does it just plan stink? I have come to the realization that it is all. I think gone are the days of The Stand and The Shining. It is now a different Stephen King. Now are the deadlines and just wanting to pump the next book out. But, I still read them hoping for that one gem."
3,Ok,"I had read every book by King up to the 2002. His offerings after that didn't excite me anymore. Was on vacation, the only book available, gave it a shot. It was ok, nothing like his early work. Entertaining but doesn't stick with you."
5,Compelling Character and Vivid Settings Make this a Memorable King Novel,"Lisey, a woman who was married to a best-selling author, finds she is widowed. Two years after her husband's death, she still needs to figure out how to deal with her loneliness and with the reality of the nightmarish aspects of her life with Scott. As she goes through her husband's belongings to discover the truths of their married life, a deranged stalker complicates the situation. The plot entwines around the story of her discoveries, her mentally ill sister, and a magical place to where she discovers that her husband often escaped.Although there are many scenes of violence and of abuse, the book is filled with comprehensively developed characters and vivid setting descriptions, both of which make this a remarkably memorable and fascinating book, one that will stay with the reader for many, many haunting months."
4,Another winner for King,"Perhaps I'm a bit biased. I've always been a Stephen King fan, but this one covers all bases. A story of true love and the bond of family, with his signature touch of violence and the obscure. Not as lurid as his previous, Cell, this is easily recommended even for those who find King's books ""too morbid"". Certainly not a lite read. The many layers of this story coupled with the beautiful, almost poetic writing, has you hanging on every word. The only reason this one keeps you up at night is because it's just so darn good."
1,Virtually unreadable,"I'm somewhat amazed at the number of excellent reviews of this book. It's about as exciting and suspenseful as Virginia Woolfe's ""Mrs. Dalloway"". I have always been a fan of Mr. King's and have usually devoured his books. Unfortunately, that has not been the case since the late 90s. And this one is no better. There is obviously something in it the critics like--it's gotten very good reviews. And I kept reading it, to a certain degree, with that in mind--certain that it would eventually start to ""talk to me"". It never did. I found his incessant word creation disruptive and tiring. There has usually been a little of that in previous books--and a little went a long way. But it was constant in ""Lisey's Story"". Based upon reviews and opinions I have read thus far, this book will do very well; however, to those who are more of a fan of King's pre accident writing (and it has changed considerably over the past few years), this one is likely to disappoint."
2,dissapointed,"First off I'm a big S.K. fan but for me this story ...well,it just didn't grab me like his stories usually do. I very rarely give up on a book, but this one was close. It seemed like there was no flow to the story and the characters weren't interesting. I think most KIng fans will be dissapointed.Still, I'll buy his next novel."
1,The first book I may have to put down,I usually read a book a week and usuually read two Stephen King books a year (I began reading him with the Dead Zone). I read Cell earlier this year and breezed through it (although I was disappointed with the ending). Unfortunately Lisey's Story is the total opposite. I've been reading this book for two weeks now and I'm only on page 150. I have no interest in returning to this book at all. I'm finding it very boring.I have a library consisting of over 1000 books and I have a policy of once I start a book I have to finish it. I'm reevaluating that policy now.
2,my least favorite of all his books,"This is in my opinion Stephen King's weakest effort, and I have read and thoroughly enjoyed much of his work. I consider him to be one of the greatest living authors and story tellers of our time with unparalleled talent. This novel comes off as a solid short story, stretched out into 500 pages. There just isn't a lot there. The tale of Lisey and her now deceased husband is compelling, but it is so sparsely planted throughout the novel that it was like watching 10 minutes of a good movie every month until it is completely viewed. I was unable to become engaged either to the story or the characters. Rare for me, I put this book down at some point a hundred pages or so in, and read another book then came back to it weeks later and only continued because it was a King novel. I was able to stick faithfully to the Dark Tower series, which must be 5000+ pages, easier than I could to 100 pages of this book. I did not find compelling characters or story in this book."
2,Ehhhh,"I am a HUG Stephen king fan....I have read every novel at least once, and several 2 or 3 times...I read the Dark Tower series from book one to book 7 straight thru twice. The only book of his I have ever less than enjoyed was The Tommyknockers, which I felt was bland. So, suffice to say, I was psyched by the release of Lisey's Story. Wrongly so. One of what I feel to be Steve's greatest traits as a writer is his creation of character. They become very real to me, almost like old friends and new strangers. They take life in my mind, living and breathing there even when I am not in the book. Not so Lisey Debusher. She is a vapid, boring character. I call her character, not person, because character is all the life she has earned. The stroy is ok, and I have found myself enticed at times, but all in all a very dull book. If Lisey was a bit more alive, maybe this book would work. Unfortunately, for me at least, it does not. Maybe we constant readers will have better luck with Blaze."
1,Hated it and may never read another King book in my life.,This was the worst King novel I have ever read. I thought I would never be done reading it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It was padded with all kinds of dribble that didn't help the book at all except to make it longer. There was too much of what a character was thinking and not enough action. The plot was totally unbelievable. It was difficult to follow. I just couldn't wait to finish it so I could throw it in the trash where it belonged.
3,Not quite right,"I've been reading SK's books for 20 years now and was almost always impressed by his way with words. Somewhere along the way I did encounter a couple of books which I found disappointing, but with King's productivity level it's a very small ratio. Sadly this is one of those books.While it's definitely King's writing style, it is overloaded with invented words, which make the reading difficult and instead of adding to the plot they seem to only take from it. The plot itself is quite interesting, but the deliverance is tiresome as the story keeps jumping between different time-lines and events, some of which seem to be pointless to the story.I wouldn't call Lisey's story a bad book, but it's not a masterpiece for sure. Quite average for SK and thus - disappointing."
4,A POETIC UNUSUAL JOURNEY,"I have to say that I really enjoyed this book. I listened to it on tape so I wasn't as confused by the private language that husband and wife shared as many seemed to be and though the book itself jumped around a lot, in the end, everything tied together in a neat little bundle. Expect to get through the first 100 pagees in utter confusion before you settle into the rhythm of the book and understand what is truely happening. As usual with King books, he introduces subplots that aren't relevant to the main plot, but for a change most of these forays off the beaten track eventually thread back into the main storyline.The book is beautifully written and the characters are nicely developed. If you have trouble reading it, try listening to it.....the narrators voice only adds to the story."
3,"It's a good book, but not a great one...","This one just doesn't measure up to the other King novels, a pale comparison to the Dark Tower, in my opinion. It took me a while to get through it and while it is well written, the story never really grabbed me or made a horrific impression on me. I have been truly scared by several of King's novels, It, Pet Sematary, and Duma Key, and inspired and drawn in by others, The Stand, The Dark Tower Series. But this one just didn't do it for me like those other's did."
3,Lisey's Story,"When I first started reading this book, I found it somewhat confusing. It probably took me one-fourth of the book to really get into the plot and the unusual language.By the time I was half-way through the book, I was hooked! It is very different from anything else I have ever read and very different from previous Stephen King books that I had read years ago. But, all in all it was an enjoyable read and I am glad that I waded through the first part of the book to the point that I could follow what was going on.Although part of this book might be considered horror, it is primarily what I would consider fantasy. Like all of King's book it is quite long, but hey, I like a good, long book.Larry E. Matthews"
1,What a letdown!,"I've been an avid fan of King's work from the start, but it seems to me that he may be running out of creative inspiration. His last books have been less masterful than the earlier ones and this one is just awful. It's the only Stephen King book that went straight to the Goodwill box instead of being lined up with all the others on their own special bookshelf. Let's hope he gets himself together before the next one comes out."
1,"If I could give this book 0 stars, I would.","This book is just plain boring. It drags and has not substance. King creates his own language (blood bools?) that I just plain do not want to understand.The interesting thing about King is that he always has a good concept. However, he tends to destroy it with his writing style - which is just too convoluted. He needs to write succinctly or just give us all a rest.Uggh - dont bother with this one. I actually would love my $$$ back."
2,Smucking Long!!!,"Yes, Im yet another avid S.K fan, who will never give up on the master, despite being horribly dissappointedin his two lastest offerings, firstly the mediocre 'Cell', and now the neverending Liseys story.Why has King become so damn long winded?? His best novels have always been huge, but without a word to spare within an un-put-downable epic (eg Tommyknockers, IT, The Stand etc, etc)Liseys story dragged on like a long, boring movie full of dull characters. There were the odd moments of vintage King, but they were few and far between. I almost gave up halfway through, as the use of the ridiculous word 'smuck' made me want to throw the book away! I also found it irritating that Boo ya Moon was merely a poor replica of 'The Territories' within the brilliant 'Tallisman' (co written with Peter Straub)I still have faith in King and will continue to read everything that he offers us.. fingers crossed he has another great novel in him to rival his spectacular back catalogue."
2,Will the real Stephen King please stand up...,"How can it be that the person who wrote 'Salem's Lot and The Stand cranked out this boring, repetitive and annoying book. There have always been clunkers in Mr. King's repertoire. Lisey's Story, however, is the bottom of the clunker barrel. Even when Stephen King is off the mark, his writing can take lyrical turns that just enmesh and enchant the reader, and carry us along for page after page. Not so in this book. I have read all of Mr. Kings books, fiction and non-fiction and have come to a conclusion. The pod people have obviously made their own version of Stephen King, and this Pod-Stephen is the one who wrote Insomnia, Dream Catchers, Bag of Bones, From a Buick 8 and the rest of that ilk. Cell might have been a collaboration between the real thing and the clone. Anyway, if you love Stephen King, reread the old books. Lisey's Story is definitely the work of the Pod King."
2,Hard to get into,"I finally finished this book, based on other reviews I was hoping itwas going to get a lot better, it got a little better. There is no ""error"" on the answering machine as mentioned in another review, there were two answering machines and the policeman called the other one.So he's not insulting our intelligence (unless of course you count buying this book in the first place).It's a little like reading Dr.Seuss for adults with all his made upwords. The repetition of said words is absolutely maddening, doesthis man not have an editor to tell him this? I'm a bit of a King fanso this has been a very disappointing experience. I readthe other reviews and think maybe the problem is mine but nonethelessI found this to be a very difficult read which is not what I've come toexpect from Stephen King."
3,Not one of SK's best,"I'm a huge Stephen King fan and I have to be honest, this wasn't as good as I though it would be. A bit on the boring, long drawn-out side. Unfortunate that I couldn't wait and bought it in hard cover... :("
1,Boring!,"When I get a new Stephen King book, I check out of the world for a while... I just read, read, read from the opening paragraph until the last word. I am spellbound by his books. An electric connection. I LOVE Stephen King. Can't put one down.I took this one back to the library without finishing it. I kept TRYING to read it. I kept hoping it would get better.I don't think he wrote this one."
2,Ugh!,I pushed to get through this. By the end I was glad it was over. Didn't like it at all. The story was slow and complicated with all the made up language. Not my favorite book!!
2,Almost unreadable,"A couple of times I've been ready to just put this thing down and walk away, it's that painful. But as a long-time SK fan, I feel obliged to at least finish it.It's been a while since I read a SK novel, gone are the days of a new one coming out each year, so perhaps I've changed and no longer have the patience for his style. But I just find the constant ""smuckings"" and little internal ""stop that thought Lisey!"" bits irritating, and, perhaps more importantly, unrealistic.He manages to keep my attention for some time because of the whole ""what's going on?"" question -- I need to keep reading to find out the mysterious bit (NOT the scary bit). But information needs to be doled out regularly or I grow impatient, just as I have with ""Lost"" on TV.Anyway, to summarize: irritating, not scary, don't bother."
2,Not worth it,"The best I can say is - tedious. I'm 3/4 of the way through, and still hoping it will get interesting. I don't care if I finish or not. Not one of his better ones."
1,Poor effort from King,"I have read most of his books and this one one of the dullest. Dealing with a widow and her constant interceptions in her head from her dead husband gets to be quite a bore. Even down to the predictable big monster King like to end his books with, this book was dull and disjointed from beginning to end.Cell - that now was interesting, with his standard gore. This was really really ordinary and boring"
1,King reaches new low...,"And I thought SK had reached a low spot with ""Song for Susanna"" Lisey's story was the biggest piece of literary feces I have ever sifted through. I was actually embarrassed for SK for writing such nonsense. All the goo-goo ga-ga baby talk made it almost impossible to read and comprehend what the plot development was, which by the way NEVER occured. I remember the Stephen King days where if you read the book your hair stood up on your neck...the suspense in Liseys Story made me P.O'd to even be wasting my time reading it. Has SK been reduced to can-openers as his weapon of choice?The only reason(s) I finished this 500 page paperweight is it was a Xmas gift from my wife and she had already seen me start reading it and for pure curiosity of seeing how pathetic the story was going to get by the end.SK needs to stick with what works, good gut wrenching horror. I am just hoping that the last couple books are not an indication of the demise of a great suspense / horror writer.BTB"
2,Not my favorite,"Not your typical King read, in fact, I started to have a feeling that the beginning was written by his wife and that he finished it off. I felt like I was reading material written by a woman in the first half...then suddenly, it became a fast pace pretty good read. I am prejudice, I do seem to enjoy the male authors' more (with a few exceptions.) If you are looking for a good scare, this is not the book. If you are looking for a so-so read because you are bored with your life, then this is the book you want. Sorry to all of the King fans out there, this one just didn't do the trick for me."
3,This is just for the first few chapters!!! I'll update,"Everything I've been reading here by the readers has made me feel tremendous relief! I thought I was going crazy or getting Alzheimers or worse. This is the first time I ever started a King novel and ... just sort of got lost. On the PLUS side, a little voice recently told me to re-read ""The Dark Half,"" the only book by King I thought I never liked. The second time was MUCH better. A lot of what Lisey thinks about in the first few chapters certainly EVOKE George Stark, but that would be a spoiler! I'm REALLY having a hard time with this one, but I'll keep plugging away. Some things I've come to think about King: He reveres women and mothers; he hated his biological father; he really IS scared of some things; he is one of the very few male writers. living or dead, who can write in a male AND ""female"" voice, and be truly believable."
2,Couldn't finish,"If I see Steve at a Red Sox game, I'm asking for my money back. 150 pages of gaga-goo-goo talk and this book was on it's way to a library donation. Now I feel guilty because some other SOB's going to waste time on this mess."
2,Still trying to get through it,"I've been a King fan since I was in highschool, indeed I own around 30 of his paperbacks. Some have been amazing (The Stand, Pet Semetary, The Dark Tower, The Shining, IT etc.) others really great as well (Salem's Lot, Needful Things, The Dark Half, Cell etc.) and then others I just couldn't get into (Bag of Bones comes to mind). Lisey's story falls into the latter category for me.I've been reading it on and off for a couple months now. I keep getting frustrated and reading something else (just finished reading ""1984"" again). The book's sitting right there on my nightstand looking at me, daring me to read it.The problem is that I keep zoning out while reading it. Lisey's internal thoughts and the back and forth is just getting plain annoying. Enough of the smucking and bools already. It gets old. Fast.I'm not sure if I'll finish reading it. I might just pop it on my shelf and read Nightmares and Dreamscapes again. Now THAT is a great collection!"
3,Definitely not classic King,"For such a simplistic plot and an un-horror like story, I found myself drawn in to the saga of Lisey's life. Weird. I give this a 7 out of 10.-- review from the author of The Shadow God and Spiritual Sorrow."
5,As good as it gets,"I haven't finished it. In fact, I'm not a quarter through it; but Stephen has not written better - Salem's Lot, Dark Tower I, Shining, Misery. For a person who was going to quit, he reached deep inside and grabbed something truely special.Gary"
1,LISSY STORY,"As a long time reader of King novels this is one of worest books i have ever tried to read, I never did get finished, and by the time I put it down, didn't even care that I don't know how it ends."
1,Tired of his horrors,"I really love King's work but the reason always was, because of how much he knew what scared us all. It seems that now he has put out too many books about authors and their horrors, that these must be the things that scare him. I really would like a book from him again, that scares me. This one isn't it."
1,Doesn't King Have an EDITOR?,"I tried. I pushed on just past 100 pages. What happened to the Stephen King who grabbed his readers on the first page and never let go? Is there no editor who will dare to take a red pencil to The King? ""Lisey's Story"" drags, meanders and disappoints. Maybe it gets GREAT after pave 114...I couldn't spare the time to find out."
3,Too Long,"Let me start by saying that I am a Stephen King fan. He has always written well and has great command of language. The scary parts are scary and the alternate world he creates is interesting. Having said that, if any book could have used some editing it's this one. The book is way longer than it needs to be and contains too much material that does not move the story forward.Another thing, you know how the pet names other people have for each other are annoying to you? Same thing here; I was continuously distracted by Lisey's/Scott's little lovey-dovey names and mannerisms. We get it, they loved each other but as in real life, pet names are nice between you and your partner but nauseating to others.Not his best work."
3,Old King is in there in places.,"There are moments in this book, like when the husband dies, when Lisey's confronted in the study, and also in the flashback scenes, where the old King seems to be writing and its thrilling to read because he puts you right there in the moment...3 stars for those pieces.But then there are moments when the story just treads water and it seems like he's trying to stretch the book and is stopping to smell the roses and describe thunderstorms...very romantic. Its a far cry from the books he wrote in the past where things pick up about a 1/4 of the way through and the story just picks up speed and its all guts, death, gore and glory by the end. Love in those old stories was a tool used to conquer evil in the most desperate moments.Lets face it King is writing for a different audience now, some who wouldn't like the rawness of IT or Tommyknockers, and they seem to like it.Hey, SOWISA Stephen, good luck."
3,Lisey's Story,I've read nearly everyone of King's books and this is one of my least favorites. Too slow and not scary at all. At least it's still better than most horror writers out there.
1,The king is dead.,"Another let down by $tephen.This book is not horror, it's horrible. Between the made up words/language (sorry steveo, you are not Tolkin, not even in the ballpark. Your made up vocabulary sounds more like baby-talk.) and the droning on and on and on of the tale this book is not worth ""Constant Reader""'s time.Gone are the days of Great Stephen King tales. $teve, take what bit of dignity you have left and retire. Fade into the sunset like a pro. Do not keep taking the field only to fumble, stumble, and embarrass yourself."
1,Stopped Reading Out of Sheer Boredom.,"I got about 175 pages into this book, when I just stopped out of sheer boredom and brought it back to the library. The fact that I didn't want to spend money on it should've told me something. And the one star I gave wasn't actually for the book. It was for me for holding on till page 175 and not throwing it out the window.I just couldn't get interested in any of these characters from page one and things didn't improve as the story went along. It may have gotten better further on into the book, but the way King was writing up to that point, I just didn't have the patience to hold on.What is wrong with King? He's done some good stuff here and there over the last few years, like ""From a Buick 8"", but by and large his work has been lacking some vital elements needed to pull you into the story. I don't what they are, but I know that they're missing."
1,Baby Talk,"I must say, I was disappointed by King's latest work. One of my favorite things about his novels is the way he delves deep into the minds of his characters. For example, in ""IT"", he brought all of the intricate members of the Losers' Club to life.I found Lisey as a character surprisingly flat; Lisey herself didn't actually have a story, as the novel was centered around her late husband. I also found the 'secret language' between Scott and Lisey infuriatingly annoying and cutsy sounding, bordering on baby talk. It actually made me a bit embarrassed. A lot of the story was far fetched and unneccesarily disgusting (I know, I know, it IS Stephen King, but I mean in terms of this particular story and setting, a lot of it just seemed unnecessary and tacked in for impact).I'm happy for those of you who liked it, but this book wasn't for me. I'm going to go re-read ""IT"" now. ;)"
2,Lisey's Story,I have been an avid fan of Stephen King's books but this book was a disappointment. I was expecting intrigue and more but didn't get it. It seemed too sappy relating to the death of her husband. It was running on and on. I normally love his writing style of telling the story but not this time.
4,Good book,"I'm not completely finished yet but, it is good so far. I am not even to the halfway point yet though."
3,Goid but could have been better,"The story held my interest, but I found its use of its own special vocabulary off-putting. I also found its central male character to be a King variant, and he was much too heroic for my taste. Still, as I suggested initially, I CARED about these characters, especially Lisey."
2,I really gave it a chance,"I really gave this novel a chance... over 250 pages. Then, I had to put it down. I didn't like the main character nor the words King uses over and over. I just found it to be juvenile and disjointed. Not to mention uninteresting and poorly written-- as an English prof. in my spare time. Read old school King if you want to see better writing; this book is not on par with any of the better King books."
5,To the pool.......,"This book I will admit, was very slow to get started for me. It just hung there. Could be me, could be the mood I was in, I don't know. But, WHAT a good book once it began to flow. This is one of those books that stays with one after the final page is copleted. It is a love story, yes with a bit of suspense involved. But it is more than the story of love between a man and a woman, it's the story of the love of words. There were a few passages that brought me to tears but the overall atmosphere is what remains with me. The atmosphere of the forest with the sign pointing the way 'to the pool'.Mr. King your favorite english teacher must be so very proud of you. I envy you having had that type of influence in your life, and I'm also grateful you DID have that ... we are all reaping the benefits of him.Eagerly awaiting your next book. Let me go with Dicken's here: Please sir, may I have some more?"
2,Disappointment,"I was excited to see that Steven King had a new novel out. I began the book full of anticipation, eager to enter into King's world. However, as I began to read I became more and more unable to sustain interest in Lisey's world. I was bored, and I gave up. Perhaps I will try again some time; the book is still weighing down the shelf."
2,Baby Talk,"Rarely if ever does King disappoint his readers. I read 200 pages of this novel until I finally couldn't take anymore of the eternally repetitous cutesy baby talk of Lisey's dead husband. It's just too drawn out and there is very little to grab this reader 200 pages into the book.I think this is only Stephen King book I did not want to finish. He still remains my favorite writer however. It is also too much of a Romance novel for me. Give me chills and blood, not sappy sentimentalism. Your time will be better spent reading instead his (Richard Bachman)book ""Blaze"", which is as good as King gets(and that's pretty damn good). Blaze is a page-turner that will keep you up at night, in the grand King tradition."
2,"King sent me on a ""bool"", ad I didn't even get an RC at the end!!","What can I say that hasn't been said? Meandering smucking book! I wasn't sure what was happening some of the time, it was WAY too long for the story...could have been told in less than half the pages! The only thing I can say is that it offered a nice diversion and helped me go to sleep at night! Not a real plus for a suspense writer. Pick one of the Dark Tower books, and you will be glad you did!! Leave thison the shelf as a last choice read.....That being said, Stepehn King is one of the greatest writers of all time, and my opinion of this books doesn't change my opinion about him!"
2,Disjointed,"Didn't like this book much. Kept waiting to like it. Didn't. SK's books don't have to be scary, gory thrillers for me to like them. They do however need to be coherent. Glad I got this one at the library instead of buying it.."
3,"Not bad. Not what I'd hoped, but not bad, either.","Lisey's Story, unfortunately, reads to me like a poor man's Bag Of Bones. The plots are similar: widow/widower grieving beloved spouse, who is attempting contact from beyond the grave, with some unresolved issues that are, of course, supernatural in nature. But as is usually the case, it's King's writing that saves the day. His characters are especially vibrant here, and though the plot will seem rehashed to Constant Readers, it's entertaining enough to keep you in the game. I don't regret this read. Even though it feels very familiar, it's like a great stretch of road in a different season - sometimes you notice different things in a different light."
4,Good Read,"I like King, and this is one of his better ones. Not quite as good as The Stand or Hearts in Atlantis, but close. When it boils right down to it, it's a love story, and one that has a smidge of Nicholas Sparks. There was only one part I had some trouble with and that was believing the whole world of Boo ya Moon, an imaginary world that author Scott Landon often visits. If you can buy into this supernatural world, the story is perfect. Once I forced myself to care about it, I enjoyed it. Even if you don't, the story of Scott and Lisey's marriage makes it all worth it. By the time you finish with the book, you'll feel as if you know these two people, and you'll care very much about them."
3,Pretty Weak,"I hate to disparage, because I love most of what SK has written. However, this book very strongly reminded me of a combination of two of King's other books: ""Rose Madder,"" and ""The Dark Half."" And sadly, those were two of his weaker works."
2,Excruciatingly L O N G and overwritten,"I'm a fan of old King from the 80's, but he's really gone overboard with this new book. Good writing doesn't mean you can tell a good story. There were a few fleeting moments of suspense, but for the most part, it's just nonstop rambling for hundreds of pages. I didn't like any of the characters in this and thought it was terribly overwritten. It takes him entire paragraphs to describe the most ordinary of acts, and by the time he finishes, all tension has fizzled into nothingness. I can only assume he keeps selling books because of public loyality. The fact that this won the Bram Stoker award last year for best novel tells me people voted for him by default, not having read the other finalists. It's a shame, and frankly, embarrassing. Don't waste your time with this stinker."
2,A severe miss!,"It amazes me what Stephen King can get away with some times. Make no mistake, King is an amazing writer and has written some of America's best horror novels. Here however, he buries a possible good story under four hundred pages of near indecipherable time/reality jumps with newly created words that do nothing for the reader or story. I was so disappointed by this novel. The usual King creepiness is there only sporadically the general plot was all over the place. Overall, this is just a minor speed bump for King but should be skipped unless you are King fanatic."
1,Coup de Jarnac,"From this day on I swear that1) I will never eavesdrop the couples and try to understand their private language2) I will never be curious about the thoughts of a recently widowed wife.3) I will finish all the books that I have started reading (If I can finish Lisey's Story, I can do it with any reading material)For this moment of enlightenment let me express my gratitude to Mr. King. Thank you for taking back with Insomnia and Lisey's Story what you had given me with It and The Stand."
1,Still Working On It...,"I thought it was ME. I have tried to ""get into"" this book about four or five times and just keep giving up. Usually I get lost in Stephen King's novels; can't put them down. But this one goes ON and ON and ON. It's confusing to say the least. I don't even like Lisey anymore. Me thinks she thinks too much. I still have about 80% of the book to finish."
3,Lisey's Story by Stephen King,"Pretty good book, a little hard to follow in the beginning. Not scary, but a pretty good read."
1,TEDIOUS,"I got one-quarter in and kept telling myself it would get better.... halfway thru I simply felt commited to finishing it. Tedious is the best description I can give. It just ... went on... forEVER.... there was no ""horror"", no suspense, no nothing. Just a lot of pages of whatEVER."
1,Didn't sound like King!,"I found it very hard to get through, laborious in fact, but I kept going because it's King, and I love his books! Unfortunately it didn't get better for me. I prefer King's faster-paced and larger-world stories."
2,"We enjoy your books! Particularly the early, scary ones.","Woody Allen had a great true moment of self-criticism in his film ""Stardust Memories"" (1980) where he comes upon a couple of aliens who tell him:""We enjoy your films! Particularly the early, funny ones.""The same is with Stephen King who got lost in himself somewhere in the early 1990s.Lisey's Story is neither Christine nor The Shining. It's neither Pet Sematary nor Salem's Lot. Bluntly, it's more like a lot of blah blah blah tucked into 600 pages. Sometimes, you may get the creepy feeling that King let his comupter do most of the job by itself.It won't hurt King to take a long break, relax and search for the roots of good writing. I think he can afford that."
1,Gerald's Game crossed with Misery--really dull,"300 pages into this 500 page novel, I set it aside. Really boring and no narrative drive, which is usually King's strength.For years, I'd heard how bad this was, how it was simply a mash-up of Gerald's Game and Misery--with a little Bag of Bones added--and sadly, it was."
5,WOW,"This is one of the best books I've ever read! It's like the most perfect math equation, this book is magic, a masterpiece truly."
1,Bool-spit,"I would think the man who wrote THE SHINING and THE STAND would be ashamed to use phrases such as ""Shut the smuck up"" and ""all the bad-gucky."" When did Stephen King get cutesy?Like many of his fans, I adore the early King works. He is one of the best writers ever--for me not because of his penchant for horror but because of his canny grasp of human psychology. He's been one of my gods for a long time. Which makes it all the more sad to see him stooping to this drool. I agree with the reviewer who said King should heed his own excellent advice from ON WRITING and cut out the bad-gucky stuff. Come on, Mr. King. Please."
2,(sigh),"I have never not finished a book. Until now. This book sucked.The worse part is, is that I'm a King apolagetic. There is always something to be gotten out of his work. With this book, I'm not so sure. Maybe if I would have finished it, I might have found something. But I couldn't.I'm sorry sai King."
3,A different kind of King book,"I just finished reading Lisey's story a few days back and have to say I was pleased with this book in the end. Unlike some of the other readers, I wasn't leary of buying Lisey's story because this was a love story or a romantic novel. I enjoy romance as much as suspense or fantasy so I was ready for any of the above as can and often does happen in King's novels.Sure there was the strong love connection between Lisey and her late husband Scott but saying this is a love story is like saying the Shinning is a story about a family going on a vacation to watch over an abandoned hotel It is, but there's a little more to the story than that.Lisey's Story is an intriguing tale filled with the elements of horror and the supernatural. Some of Kings ideas are a little 'Out there' but that is why I enjoy Stephen King. He can spark our imagination and bring a chill to our spine. If you are a King fan or not, I think you will enjoy this book as much as I did."
1,Boring and a bit silly.,"Liseys Story is not the best of King. It is the tale of a widow of a famous writer who had a bizarre sense of humor. It was long, had extended parts of irrelevant banter, and had an inordinate amount of made up words. Lisey and her dead husband practically had their own language of stupid words, and King makes the reader learn each and every one of them throughout the course of the book. The book does start to get interesting about 300 pages in, when a madman pulls out all the stops in order to acquire the dead authors unpublished manuscripts. However, by the time this occurs in the book I actually hated the main character and was cheering for the villain. This book would have been a decent novella or short story, all he had to do was cut out 400 pages of the silly talk and get down to the action.Even the biggest fan should ignore Lisey's Story...Relic113"
2,A Disappointment,"I've read everything that Stephen King has written and have enjoyed most, if not all, of his books. This book, however, is the first and only one that I've actually put down and considered never picking up again. It was truly grueling, but I did force myself through it -- reading just a few pages at a time before dozing off! If you manage to get through the first half of the book, you finally get a sense of where the story is going and it starts to move along and become a little more interesting. Although King seems to have fun making up words and phrases, it is so excessive in this book that it becomes extremely annoying. I was relieved when I finally finished the book and didn't have to pick it up again. I kept wondering if King was having a good laugh thinking about all of the fools that would buy this book simply because he wrote it! He had to have some idea what his readers would think, but I guess he didn't care."
3,not one of stephens better ones,"while I enjoyed the basic story, it could have done without the first 200 pages and it would have been just as goo. It has been a long time since I had to SUFFER through such drivel.It was almost as though the person he paid to write for him took great pains to write like him.I do not understand why this book got such good reviews? Maybe his readers were more loyal than they should have been,Allen"
1,Major Disapointment,"I'm A SK fan from way back, and have been off fiction for about 5 years.I got back on with some SK novels that I missed recently, and they were all pretty enjoyable, until I hit a wall with 'Lisey's Story'...The only reason I am commenting is because I couldn't believe that what I was reading was as boring as I thought it was. I got to page 332 and hung it up. Honestly, this is the first SK book I was bored enough with to put down. Major plot hole; if 'Lisey"" has 20 million bucks, and doesn't trust the police, why doesn't she hire a body guard?I guess I'll never find out , because I can't get through this. I have slogged thru many, many of SK's minor(and less bloated) works, and this is the worst by far."
1,Painful,"I don't think I am giving away any plotline to say this is one of the most irritating of the hundred plus books I have listened to. You know those annoying couples who have cute little inside words for things? This is an entire book of that. Smucking, Gunkie, SOWIESA, Boule, Bouja Moon, African (for a afghan)... they keep bringing them up incessantly as if to remind you how tight a couple they are. I think it made more irritating by the reader trying to lend a new voice to every character. I'd probably give the book two stars if I read it but it get another star knocked off for the grating audio presentation."
2,"If His Name wasn't on it as author, I would have tossed it after the first several pages","I bought Lisey's Story because I have been reading King since Carrie was first published. Maybe I have outgrown him - outgrown the genre, but really, this was a snore right from the start. Because 'The King' wrote it, I gave it try after try, but just could not get interested in the main character - could care about her (ongoing...and ongoing...) inner conflict or ramblings. Pass this one up or get it for your collection maybe. He's done much better work and I am hoping he does so again, but I haven't been happy with the latest offerings. I actually thought he was lending his name to some student writer - it was that bad."
1,Pathetic,"Steven King has not written anything of value in years. I used to thoroughly enjoy his earlier work. Over the years he has had the ability to begin with an initial provocative idea. However, his recent novels wind up going NOWHERE. The details are unendingly boring and go on and on ad nauseum...I tried Cell and at times ,I found myself laughing at the inanity of it. I vowed never to read another of his novels, only any short stories - if he could limit his excruciatingly wandering prose.I picked up Lisey's Story based upon some good reviews by publications that I have valued( Hah! ) with the thought that it might be a gem ...unlike his recent work. However, after a hundred pages or so I found myself enjoying it as much as I would having to walk through waist-high mud. I tried in vain to finish it but alas, could not - it was so BORING !I would think that if his name hadn't been on this novel it would've been sent back postage owed .Goodbye Mr. King, your run is over ..."
3,"boring story, nice characters","Unlike the last reviewer, I really like King's internal dialogue. In fact, that is my favorite thing about his stories. His characters feel real to me even if the plot is lacking. I liked Lisey, even liked her sisters, but the plot left something to be desired. I liked the insights into the past she and scott shared, but the whole stalker aspect was farfetched."
3,An enjoyable read,"Not my favorite SK nor my least favorite. I confess I have caught myself saying ""smuck"" a few times.The sisters are the most intriguing part of the book and I would love to read more about them. How about ""Amanda's Story"" and ""Darla's Story""...."
3,If Lisey tells another story she should learn to hire a good editor,"I am surprised at the fact that apparently Simon and Schuster/Doubleday/Macmillan/Scribner doesn't feel that they have to actually do any editing of such a master writer as Stephen King. They should reconsider that thought.A full 35% of this book could have been edited out without effecting the story one bit, although then I wouldn't have slept so much.I hope with the next novel Mr. King will stick to a cohesive story and not drive off into the back-country looking for more pages to fill just for the sake of making his book longer.I have loved all of his books (except Gerald's Game which was also similarly overly wordy/boring for a good portion). I was hoping that this might turn out to be another Rose Madder, but the only similarity I found was that the more I read, the madder I rose.Better luck next time."
2,Rose Madder Revisited,This book is a revisit of Rose Madder with a touch of Gerald's Game.I think that Mr. King is running out of ideas.I'm glad that I didn't pay a lot for this book.
5,One of King's best.,"No need to ramble on: this, indeed, is one of King's best books. He wrote some stinkers during his time, but some great ones. The Stand, It, The Dark Tower series. But this novel here, we get to see directly into his mind.I point you to page 212. About halfway down the page: ""He is eating a dirt sandwich. (It's a big one I caught in the pool where we all go down to drink and fish.)"" By that he means the language pool, and in that quote is one of the only 1st person lines in the book. King's talking.He makes me and, I'm sure, many others out there want to continue writing. He's passing the torch!Give it a read."
1,King has lost his touch,"It is time for Stephen King to retire. Worst story ever! If you want a good Stephen King book, pick up Carrie or the Dark Tower Series. Dont bother to pick anything up from his last few years."
3,It was OK,"Lisey's Story reminded me a lot of Rose Madder and Stationary Bike. It was slow-going for first couple of hundred pages and while it did get interesting it wasn't ""gripping"" or ""page-turning."" King tries to get the reader involved in the character, Lisey, by using words and phrases that I've never heard anyone use and they do get awfully tiring after a while. ""Smucking,"" as one reviewer mentioned, is a case in point."
2,Two Star Rating is Generous,"I won't write a long review complete with quotations from the book....I'll just say that overall it was very disappointing. I literally had to force myself to finish it, hoping there would be some reward at the end. There wasn't!The book simply didn't engage my imagination all and it didn't provide any type of connection with the characters. Even the piebald creature seemed one dimensional.Disappointed....but still a big King fan."
1,Irritatingly overwritten,"Many reviewers have already expressed their dislike of the ""private language"" used by Lisey and her late husband, but few have mentioned King's tendency to blabber on at great length about something that could have been handled with many fewer words. His writing in this book is the opposite of economical. Extravagant? Seems too polite a term for his running on at the mouth.As irritating at the ""private language"" is the way King has Lisey run through lists of worn-out cliches, followed by ""As the saying goes."" He piles on several cliches about dying (kicking the bucket, buying the farm, cashing your checks, etc.) as well as vomiting (tossing cookies, etc.)and lots of other examples. To what end? To place such cliches in the mouth (or mind) of a character is no excuse for bloating your novel with them.When he's good (as in his short stories for The New Yorker magazine, and some novels), he's very good. When he's bad, he's terrible. This book is one of the terrible ones."
2,Good Narrator..But Get To The Point Already,"Lisey's Story (AUDIOBOOK) (CD)I enjoyed the narrator in this audio book version.But I couldnt keep going on.I kept waiting for something interesting to happen but it took so long I gave up.The funky words(smucking,strap it on)ect. didnt bother me like it did other reviewers(although blood bool still confuses me) I think that made it a little bit more interesting. We all have our made up words in our family's and lives.I also couldn't keep up with the jumping back and forth between her memories and actual time.I WANTED so badly to enjoy this book,but nope.Duma Key was wonderful...go read that! lol"
2,"Sorry, I can't get past the smucking","Two attempts and I made it to page 59. I wouldn't have made it that far but for King's name on the cover. I've always found something to like in everything he's written. I've enjoyed the sparse use of made-up language in his other books, but this is too much.It demeans Lisey. It comes off as childish and affected. The reviews attempt to justify it as showing the deep, loving bond between Lisey and Scott. Well, so does a healthy sex life, but that doesn't mean we need to see it on every page.There may be a hell of a story buried in this book, but this is one Constant Reader who's taking a pass this time."
3,Steve is losing it,"I'm just about through this book, and so far, it's a disappointment. It seems as if Steven K. is trying too hard, and has gotten way too introspective in this story.In the earlier King books, there were gems on every page. Single sentences that were observations about life. Plain and simple philosophy that starkly illustrated the human condition. In ""Lisey's Story,"" I have found only three ""keepers,"" worthy of mention. That is a sad commentary for an author that has given me so many years of pleasurable reading.I have read every book by Steve, and I will beg, borrow, or buy used every new book he writes, because historically.......just when I give up on him, the old magic reappears. The ""Dark Tower Epic,"" is a case in point. Some of those chapter were the best ever written. Some of them were boring as hell, and a waste of time to sit down with. Taken overall, I wouldn't have missed ""The Dark Tower,"" for the world. In summary, ""Lisey's Story,"" is no ""Rose Madder."""
2,Please spare yourself,"I finished this book only because I was on a long flight and had nothing else to read - the airline magazine puzzles were completed already:( In hindsight, jumping out of the plane would have been less painful. It was a struggle finish this book. I think this could have been a great short story, but 600+ pages was too much (of nothing). I'm giving this book two stars based on King's reputation more than anything else."
5,What a Treat!,"Whether you are already a Pollni fan or you are just strating to be one, this CD is a real treat. The collection of Pollini performances contained here so vividly illustrates the formidable pianistic artistry of this giant italian Maestro. Not surprising, when you know that the compilations were selected by the artist himself: they range from his early D.G. recordings (e.g. Stravesky's Petrushka) to more recent ones, and include a wide range of genres.As usual, Pollini's interpretations are full of subtle yet profound nuances, breathtaking yet without the slightest hint of show-manship. Bravo Maestro."
3,Review of English Translation,"This book has been translated into English, but I don't think that he translates as best as he could. He translates into modern/slang English, and not the English that would French would directly translate to. If you would like to get a general gist of Chrétien de Troyes' book, then this translation would be the best to read. Unfortunately, the lines of this book are only in English; there is no Old French to compare his English to. That does make it harder to read if you're into die-hard French Translation. For the average reader, this book would be a good buy."
1,Who Cares? Skip it.,"A long, LONG book about being single from a married mother of two? Who are we kidding?I found this book so boring and so unsurprising that I quit after about 150 pages. (And the only reason I stuck it out that long was that I'd paid full-price at the bookstore.)It's like a sociology text written by someone who's not a professional sociologist. Skip it."
4,The single woman in the 20th century,"I really enjoyed her analysis of the cultural icons of the various decades. Her screenwriting background shows in her delightful analysis of a variety of films from the silent era all the way up through the recent television sitcoms. I think her final chapter is the weakest, but it's hard to analyize something while living in the middle of it.I stayed up until one in the morning to finish the book which is a testiment to how well written it is."
5,a must read!,This book is a must read for every single person. I so appreciated learning the history of other women who have paved the way and struggled with similar issues. So validating to the single's experience! :) I highly recommend this book.
2,"Sorry, Says the Single Girl","I guess if I'd wanted a research paper this would have been the perfect book. I was looking forward to an easier read, a little more upbeat style like cover suggests (don't judge a book by the cover is right). Maybe some more factoids, too. I did enjoy the part about where the definition of ""spinster"" came from, but I think I could've found that through the power of Google. The random quotes at the beginning of each chapter were confusing, too. Bachelor Girl has prematurely found its place on my bookshelf, waiting until I have read everything else...ever...for its turn to get read cover-to-cover."
3,none,I was very disappointed in this book...there just was not much there!I wish I had just ordered 2 of the previous purchase!
3,Not the best guidebook,"I was disappointed with this guidebook- it was poorly laid out and skimmed over areas. Basic information and historical notes were okay. I mainly used the guidebook in Amsterdam, and found it too bulky and time-consuming to use efficiently. If you are going to Amsterdam, I would recommend Lonely Planet's Best of Amsterdam (see my other review). This guidebook was simply okay. While it was accurate, I would suggest looking for another book."
5,The Best Book on Writing I've Found,"There are many of us who would like to improve our writing skills or even write for a living. Good writing is power, and it is one of the most valuable skills a person can develop. Most books about writing are really about style or structure or grammar or about writer's block or someone's personal experiences as a writer or how to develp a novel. This book is the best in its class to address basic writing, sheer and simple. I have been a copywriter for more than 20 years, and currently teach writing at a major university. This book is gold. Some examples of student writing will bring tears to your eyes, but more than anything, the book gets to the absolute heart of what makes good writing. Buy it and you won't regret it. (P.S., I am not related to the author.)"
2,Was Good - Bad Support,I purchased FlashTrax two years ago and it worked great until I bought a new CF card. No where in the manual does it specify that the system is limited to 1GB and smaller cards. My 2GB card (common size now days) is not compatible according to support. Their failure to support larger card sizes is a major disappointment.
1,Constant blue screen problems.,"I have own it for almost 2 years. This products deserves 4-5 stars when it works. My main use for it is to copy photos from digital cameras when I travel. Copying process is a bit slow but acceptable.But I constantly have Blue Screen issues (turn on and get blue screen only). At that point the only way to fix it is boot firmware update from CF card. Regardless of every latest firmware updates which all claim to have fix the problem, it still remains a constant problem. And if you are traveling to out of the way places & w/out internet access, then you better have a copy of the re-boot firmware with you.I just had the blue screen problem again. This time re-booting from latest firmware no longer fixes the problem. I called tech support. It will cost me $155+shipping to fix it and they guarantee the replacement part for $90 days. I asked if the Blue Screen issue will remain? He replied, ""That will always remains an issue."""
1,Perhaps the worst support on Planet Earth,"I can't speak to other Smart Disk products, but I find it hard to believe their support is any better.My first unit lasted almost a year, and was deemed ""unrepairable"" by Smart Disk when I returned from an overseas journey 13 months after purchase. I'd acquired another one while my first was out of commission, which was defective on initial use. The screen was erratic, sometime my computer would recognize it (Windows XP), sometimes not. After a lengthy conversation with customer support, I learned this ""new to me"" unit was out of warranty because it had been manufactured 18 months earlier. This is the only company I know, apart from our local dairy, that bases their warranty on their date of manufacture, in addition to date of purchase. How is a consumer to know how long a product has been the pipeline?If you choose to purchase one of these units, I suggest the ""date of manufacture"" be guaranteed by the seller, as it's not visible on the box."
1,Dead as a Door Nail,"I purchased the 30 gig version from Amazon. It appears to be the same as the 40 gig, except for the drive size. I loved this thing. It worked great. Unfortunately, I left it alone for about 4 months, and when I went to use it the other day, I got the opening screen, and it went nowhere from there. Dead, dead, dead. And on its 13 month anniversary, to boot...or I guess, not to boot. I guess I'll have to pay for any repair now."
1,Don't Buy This Item,"I purchased this item in 2004 for hundreds of dollars just prior to an overseas trip, and used it again in 2005 and 2006 for two other trips - 3 times total. It has not been used since. It takes a long time to transfer photos and viewing them takes forever. I think the buttons are difficult to manipulate. It also takes hours and hours to charge if the battery is completely dead. I recently got it out and charged the battery, but the screen is so dim I can barely see anything on it. I have many photos stored in it and can't see them or figure out how to delete them so I can dispose of this useless piece of junk. Don't waste your money on this item. I would never trust it with my photos. Buy another brand."
3,Software Could be Better,"Pros: The concept of this device is great. While traveling and taking photos, I definitely need someplace to dump files off my flash cards without having to lug around a laptop. The size is very portable and just right. The easy dumping acting with the one buttom ""copy"" function is perfect.Cons: The device gets pretty hot when in use. The software in this device surprised me. I thought it would be a little more sophisticated than it is. It's a little tedious going through the programs/menus etc.Wishful thinking: I really wished the screen was better...wouldn't it be great if it could have had a plasma screen? :)"
5,a happy camper!,"Though I had my doubts about ordering this book, I was very happy with the results. It arrived quickly and was in much better condition than I expected. I highly recomment ""onceuponatime"" and amazon, too!"
5,"Here, Thirteen Is Lucky","I know that Welty has several editions out of her stories. I know that these stories have been anthologized a lot (""A Worn Path,"" ""A Wide Net,"" and ""The Hitch-Hikers""). So it doesn't matter to me what edition of her stories that you buy, as long as you read them.This edition is my first exposure to her collected stories (after I first read her autobiographical book, ""One Writer's Beginnings"") and I must admit that I am fascinated. She includes an incredible about in the settings, in the agile characterizations, and in her own unique, point of view. She is a master storyteller.My personal favorites include ""A Wide Net,"" ""A Worn Path,"" and ""Why I Sleep At The P.O."""
2,Was worse then expected.,"Do not read this book unless you like short stories or are required to do so. Each story is like reading the exposition of a novel, which is the most uninteresting part. Here are some of what the stories are about: 1) A woman who lives at the post office and has male relatives who wear dresses 2) A man who's wife said she drowned herself because he came home late, so the man went to look for here body in the river AND 3) Two mentally challenged people who want to get married and one is a xylophone player If these sound interesting to you get the book. They certainly weren't for me. Yet everyone's taste is different."
2,Disappointed,"I saw this book and it's companion book were by Max Lucado, so immediately purchased 2 sets to give to grandkids. They stories are okay, but the artwork was on the creepy side. I thought maybe it was just me, but as soon as my daughters saw them, they both commented on the graphics. I wouldn't think this look would be very appealing for little kids. Am sending the creepy books back!"
1,You Don't Have to Be Mine,"Helen Gurley Brown once said that no good girl ever turned bad because of a book, and I maintain the reverse is probably true as well: no bad child ever turned good because of a book, either. So while Mr. Lucado's aim of teaching children that material possessions don't make us valuable in the eyes of our Creator is an admirable one, buying the child a book that says so is probably not the most effective means of teaching it. Borrow the book from your public library, and have your child donate the $15.99 to a local charity instead."
1,Would you buy poison if it came in candy wrapper?,"Don't trust labels. Just because it says ""Child Safe"" or""Christian"" doesn't mean it is.This is apparently a ""Christian"" book, however, I wasdisturbed by the text near the end...when his maker pointsand says, ""Did I create Wemmicks to act like that.""I won't type the offending material here but I would urgeyou to read this book CAREFULLY before giving it to your child.DO NOT GIVE THIS BOOK TO SOMEONE AS A GIFTUNTIL YOU HAVE READ THE OFFENDING MATERIAL"
5,Magnifico,"An amorous, charming film that shows a little more of the already awesome life of Pablo Neruda, plus a tender touch of my beloved Sicilian land. A real poem!"
5,French Letter,What a delightful film. all about the language of beauty and the beauty that is language. The poetry oozes from every frame. and how sad that the actor was dying as he was making this film. I can still see him sitting at his fisherman father's table eating his dinner gruel while his nose runs. They would never allow such human touches in Hollywood. A perfect A+.
1,Big dissapointment,"I bought the movie based on many good reviews on this site. Wow, what a mistake! The movie is extremely slow and the central character dull & boring. I've bought and enjoyed many foreign movies from Amazon (Belle Epoque, Malena, Life is beautiful among others); but do yourself a favor and stay away from this one..."
5,A delight!,"This is a wonderful film. It has romance, poetry, beautiful photography, a lovely score, and a great story. I so enjoyed the rented version that I immediately had to buy it. I will enjoy watching it over and over."
5,A wonderful film for all adults,"Even if you're the type of viewer who doesn't like subtitles, give il Postino a chance. The characters are seeking to discover the meaning of their lives. By the end of the film you will be pondering the meaning of your own. This movie is superior to almost every other. If you enjoy it you should also try to find a copy of the American film, Trip to Bountiful which covers some of the same themes and is also very well done."
5,wonderful film-don't miss,"If you're a fan of quality foreign films, make sure you see Il Postino.I hadn't seen it until recently, and it was just wonderful. Since then,I've talked to a number of friends who have it on their favorites list.One sweet, delightful, sad, well-done story on film."
5,The lead actor died 12 hours after the filming was completed for IL POSTINO,"I watched Massimo Troissi as the lead character in IL POSTINO and was transfixed by the depth of his performance Mario, the Postman become poet.His eyes and expressions are some of the finest that I have ever seen.To my chagrin, when I researched him after viewing the film,I discovered that he literally gave his all to make this film because he was so aware of his imminent death.He dies in the film and in real life Massimo Troissi died 12 hours after the cameras stopped rolling.You need to know little about this sweet,sweet film IL POSTINO,THE POSTMAN.See this film for an acting tour-de-force.The film and the performances are literally to die for!"
2,Il Postino,"This adaptation of Skarmeta's El cartero de Neruda is horrendous. It fails to incorporate the full depth of Mario's story and brings it out of its true-to-life context. Still, it retains enough to stand as a poignant story. Read the book if you liked the movie."
2,You will be disappointed if you listened to the hype,"This is a pleasant, easy-paced small film. One attempts to identify with young Mario, but the character fails to develop, except as a kind of political hero for Italian communists. The Pablo Neruda character wasn't developed at all. There was very little plot (no, I wasn't looking for ""car-chases"" or violence or sex). If you are tired when you begin watching, you might fall asleep. It was engaging enough to keep my attention, but I was well-rested. The best part of the film was the English translation of the Pablo Neruda poem shown at the end. I am glad to have seen Il Postino because (1) it was a pleasant way to spend a boring Saturday afternoon, and (2) I learned of the beautiful, haunting poetry of Neruda. In short, it was nice, but over-hyped by Miramax. And it became a sort of ""must-see"" for self-styled intellectuals and the otherwise pretentious."
2,I really tried to like this movie...,"but I ended up turning it off minutes before the end, out of sheer and desperate boredom. I really did not like the main ""common man"" character guy--he annoyed me. The story dragged on and on until I feared it would never end."
2,Boring,"This movie wasn't as good as all the reviews I had read. Infact, it was pretty boring. The story is underdeveloped and not verybelievable. The scenery is absolutely breathtaking however, as isMaria Grazia Cucinotta.In the midst of a pre-WW2 economicdepression, Mario Ruoppolo (Massimo Troisi) takes on a part-time jobdelivering mail to the remote cliff-side home of the famous poet PabloNeruda (Philippe Noiret). Poor and lonely, Mario becomes infatuatedwith the wealth, fame, and sex-appeal of Pablo. Trying to imitatehim, he tries his own hand at poetry while courting the beautifulBeatrice (Cucinotta).The movie becomes very annoying with itspro-communism sub-theme, and the DVD desperately needs Englishdubbing. Sub-titles get old fast."
2,Wanted to like this movie,"I really wanted to like this movie. I mean, romance and scenic vistas are two things I typically really like in a movie. However, I just found the movie too slow. I really couldn't nurse up much identification /sympathy with the main characters. Maybe if I would have grown up in a small town? There were some redeeming qualities to this movie. Some of the scenes between the two men were really touching. I thought the movie improved greatly after the poet left and the main character (I can't remember his name) experienced some self discovery. However, it took to long, in my opinion, for the movie to get to this point.Overall, I would say this movie is worth suffering through for the last 20 minutes or so of self realization, but just barely."
1,Very disappointed!,"After reading the reviews for this film, I had high hopes for an enjoyable evening--with popcorn and cokes at the ready. However, this move fails in many ways. It is not about Mario's romance (as described) but about his relationship with the famed poet. When Mario speaks, he mumbles, slurs his words, and often does not face the person listening to him. In addition, he speaks so slowly that all sympathy for him is lost. No one watching the film with me found anything funny in the film, yet it is described as a ""romantic comedy."" Other parts of the film are predictable and boring. One person with me fell asleep watching it. Another spent time petting the dog. As for myself, I was continually angry at the advertising deception used to market this film. Compared to U.S. films, it rates an 8 on a 10 scale. The plot is good, and of course the scenery is nice. As a watchable film, however, it rates about a 2, or perhaps 1.5 on a 10 scale compared to international films."
2,Right Movie Wrong Format,I was very disappointed when it was discovered that the DVD that I had ordered from Amazon would take over two weeks to arrive because it was coming from a supplier in Italy (understandable given the origin of the movie)I was doubly disappointed when it became apparent that my new Sony DVD player did not recognize the format of the disc and could not play it. My assumption is the DVD sent is only playable on European players. Why they would send such a DVD to the U.S.is a mystery. I remain dissatisfied.
4,Did a good job,The book was in good condition and I was very impressed with the wrapping. The wrapping was from a German Magazine which made my day :)
1,Not Actually Lost in the Amazon,"I reviewed ""Lost in the Amazon,"" which was released last summer. Now, I find that ""Lost in the Amazon"" is just a re-titled version of ""Extreme Exposure."" ""Lost in the Amazon"" was at best improperly titled since the expedition remains on course for the duration of the trip. It is indeed an adventureless story that the author has attempted to refashion into a life threatening ordeal. In short, the book about Kilpatrick's plodding through the jungle and he's bothered by bugs, the heat and the rain. If that's not bad enough, Kilpatrick is a Christian fundementalist and if I had a choice between enduring his religious diatribes and being bitten by the voracious bugs I'd choose the bugs every time."
3,Book for a plane or doctor's office,Book is on par with John Grisham. Suitable for an airplane or a doctor's office or the subway. Decently written with a predictable plot-line but an interesting perspective for those who find Japan an interesting culture. I will buy his next offering and keep it handy for my next flight.
2,"Only ""sort of"" a thriller...","Well, it started out as an exciting book. And the author does have writing talent. But after the initial killings take place, the book enters a slooooooowwww period that goes on and on and on, until the blatantly predictable ending. I'm the kind of person who never sees the ""twist"" in movies coming, but the ending of this book was waving a yellow flag from three miles away.As a wimpy white belt who just started karate a month ago, I did enjoy reading the bits concerning the dojo and different Japanese ideas. But the idea that this adjunct college professor (we are never given an explanation of how he is able to read Japanese-- did they teach that in kempo?) who has trained in martial arts in his spare time is able to rise to the level that he does... it certainly stretches the plausibility factor more than a Jackie Chan movie. At the end I was just waiting for this book to be over."
1,Lack Luster at best,"I found this book to be a very Unreal, the combat was writen as if by someone who has never been in a real fight in there life. only trained in the world of make believe. the author also likes to keep his characters in a tight stereotype, the japanes masters who do not like whites, the white student trying to be more like his japanes master, the master who is above all.if you want to read a very good seires martial arts books that are more basied in reality try the Rain books by Barry Eisler."
3,"kinda hokey, but fun","Mr. Donohue touched on a subject that is sacred to many martial artists. That is, the inner sanctum of the dojo, its sensei and the relationship between sensei (lit. one who came before--teacher) and deshi (student). The author did a fantastic job of describing the attitude of a Japanese teacher toward his students, especially gaijin. He also introduced many readers to some Japanese terms that are endeared within the dojo walls.The characters, though, are somewhat flat. I believe Mr. Donohue could have developed his characters a little more, offering more insight into the lives, the training and interpersonal relationships between each.All in all, the reader should enjoy this book if he/she enjoys the traditional Japanese ways. I'll definately purchase the author's next book due out some time in the fall, with the hopes and expectations that he pursues growth in his characters."
1,Ridiculous,I suppose martial artists might find it interesting and there are some interesting thoughts concerning sensei but wow! this is just a terrible story. The unlikely and unbelievable hero is a black-belt ignoramus. Over and over again when faced with simplistic obvious evidence he responds with utter disbelief until it actually gets funny. His stupidity leads us into the final battle which smacks of adolescent heroic dreams.
2,Spanish DVD,This DVD is in Spanish! The listing is not very clear about that except in small print under DVD language.
4,Thank you Oscar!,"My husband is from Brownsville and we both loved this book. We are still laughing about Chango. Great stories, wonderful characters. I am not much of a writer myself, so I will leave my review at that!"
5,Kept me reading...,"I loved how easily Casares expressed the thoughts of his characters. I felt like I was there in many of the stories, feeling all of the character's emotions. Regardless of culture, many of the emotions exhibitied in the book can be felt and are relateable. There was a story about an annoying dog, I laughed so hard because I've been there. And what about the annoying salesman (worse being a family member), been there too.It was a quick, fun read and was left ready for more Oscar Casares."
5,A must-have for Kinks fans,"Far more than a simple listing of where and what the Kinks played over the years, this book provides a detailed look at the lives of the Davies brothers in particular, as well as some of the other members of the band. Some of the songs have even more meaning when you learn of the stories and details behind them. And it's a tremendous benefit to have a US/UK discography so that there's no doubt what may be missing (if anything) from your Kinks kollection.What leaps out at me from all of the details is a portrait of tremendously-talented songwriter Ray Davies as a reluctant rock star who may have been happier working in film or the musical theater, and a portrait of tremendously-talented guitar player Dave Davies as a man who wrestled with depression back in the days before anyone took that seriously. It's no wonder they fought a lot.If you love the best of the British Invasion bands, buy this book. You will be glad you did."
2,Smells like lemon pledge...,"I really like the smell of lemon pledge but in my mind, I have it associated with polishing wooden furniture. The first time I used this shampoo, the smell really bothered me. I haven't gotten used to the smell since my first use. I don't feel like it cleans particularly well either. And for the price that's being charged, it should do SOMETHING well..."
1,Junk!,"Total junk. I would not own it had this purchase not been made with a gift coupon and this was the only 105"" 3TPI blade I could find for sale by Amazon. The weld is crooked, I had to set the thrust bearings a good 1/8"" behind the blade, otherwise the weld would contact the bearing as it passed by.Save your money and buy a Timberwolf, Lennox, or Starrett. If you have one, use it for cutting cruddy stuff like MDF & particle board that you don't want to use a good blade on."
1,What a deal! Do you have any bridges for sale?,"Quick go out and get one, it was $3550, and not it's only 1/2 that. Such a deal, but you better hurry, there are only 2 left in stock! They must be going fast!Or if you have a brain, you can get an OCZ or another brand with lifetime warranty and water proof for around $139.00!Now, which would you rather have?If you want this one, call me, I have a bridge for sale. Maybe I'll throw in an aircraft carrier too!"
4,A Great Help For Any Werewolf:Wild West Storyteller,"The Storyteller screen conveniently puts most of the frequently referenced charts and tables at the ST's fingertips, while providing plenty of room to hide dice rolls and ST notes. Frontier Secrets gives additional gifts, ideas about antagonists (information about Wild West Fomori), and plenty of other surprises for both players and storytellers. All in all, a great ""supplement"" for anyone running (or even playing) in a Werewolf Wild West game... even more so for the book than for the screen."
4,"Not great, but pretty good.","Not one of Kim Delaney's greatest, but it's still an interesting variation on the locked room mystery. In this case, the lock is our heroine's paralysis, and consequent confinement to a wheelchair, as well as her fear of leaving the ""security"" of her home. When a serial killer adopts the persona of her best-known villain, and begins killing others while stalking her, a suspenseful damsel in distress story develops. Despite her fierce independence, her disability forces her to turn to others for help in this crisis, while trying to find out who the killer is. He targets her with recorded threats over the internet, and the fear factor rises nicely till the villain is revealed. Sadly, the ending, not so dramatic, but pretty good nonetheless."
1,Closer and closer,"This movie was much better the first time I saw it, when it was called Copycat with Sigourney Weaver, Holly Hunter and Harry Connick Jr.Horrible acting by all the supporting characters, too many half-baked and poorly explained threads all over the place, incompetant police and FBI agents/procedure, and not really that hard to figure out who the killer is.Bringing a degree of disbelief suspension to movies is one thing, but to think that if the FBI and Police from 9 states were so unable to find any suspect, that they wouldn't have run the backgrounds thru on everyone involved with the case is just stupid.Police aren't that dumb.And it was kinda funny seeing Kim Delaney who is obsessively paranoid and over-protective of herself all movie long to instantly drop all her wards the moment the movie is about to end and you/we know the killer is about to show up.Yea that would be the killer who gave himself away halfway thru the movie with his [crummy] acting."
4,Closer and Closer,"Police suspect that a brutal serial killer has patterned the murders of three women on a series of novels written by Kate Saunders (Kim Delaney), whose writings focus on similar crimes -- and whose paraplegia is the result of a vicious attack by the same killer years earlier. With a new novel about to be published, Kate finds herself at the murderer's mercy as his attacks begin again.VERY GOOD Suspense movie! I was lucky enough to get this one for $1.00 and LOVED IT!!"
5,Lynton Rules,"Lynton is just so awake.This CD is older so songs that made commentary, then, are sharp history lesson now."
5,terrific first pasta cookbook,"wonderful intoduction to Italian pasta; worlds beyond just tomato and meat sauce, good though that may be. Highly, highly recommended: unusual, inventive sauces, many inexpensive and quick, but also several luxurious ones for special occasions or just to try. Thank God it's still in print."
4,"Not their best, but gems reside","I had put down this album for a few years and recently picked it up again and was surprised at how much I had slept on this!!I have to disagree with ""Sean"" on this one. This album is certainly not unbearable - far from it. At its worst, the lyrics are banal and the music edges dangerously close to outright cheesy (see ""Mr. Music""). My theory on this is that the rhythms have moved from the drum kit into the drum machine.But a few of the songs on this album would deserve consideration on a ""Best of"" disc. ""Selector"" hops along with Joseph Hill and an unknown guest celebrating the joy of the sound system. ""Life"", ""Sufferer"", and ""Still Rest My Heart"" all manage to touch on themes discussed in reggae music with freshness.So even though there are better Culture albums out there, please don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Geez!"
4,A shocking but moving film experience,"In this Barbet Schroeder film, Olivier (Depardieu) burglarizes the apartment of a dominatrix named Ariane (Ogier). After Ariane catches him in the act, the two fall in love and Olivier struggles to accept his girlfriend's bizarre profession. In the uncut Criterion version, some of the torture scenes (which were purportedly filmed using real-life ""slaves"" of a real-life dominatrix) are truly painful to watch, and are undoubtedly some of the most shocking ever to appear in a non-pornographic movie. Which leads one to ask: Is Matresse an artsy exploitation flick disguised as a love story, or simply a love story that makes legitimate use of graphic (and violent) sexual imagery? Either way, the film is moving, provocative, and impossible to forget. Highly recommended.Four stars out of five."
4,Sit. Stay. Buy...,"I've had the Sport Dog training collar for 2 weeks now. It was a replacement for a ""cheap"" ($100) one from W.Mart that used watch batteries on the collar and a 9V on the transmitter. After buying more batteries than I care to admit, I finally bought this one. Both the receiver and transmitter batteries recharge by a wall plug (at the same time) and the unit is waterproof - which is great. The dog responds well to one of the low settings and has quickly gotten used to the tone to avoid the zap. The only reason I didn't give this a 5 star rating was that the batteries need to be recharged every other day if you leave it on. It's not an issue, I would just prefer to have larger capicity batteries. Add that to the lifetime warranty and it has been a good deal so far."
3,Not what I thought,"I was looking for a training collar for my large dogs. I bought this along with the Add-a-dog collar because I had been told good things about this brand. When I received the product, however, I was disappointed to find that there was only one mode available when you had two collars attached. In this mode, I could only shock each dog- I could not warn them with a pager or tone. While I think this product would work great with just one dog, (there are a lot of different settings), it is not a great two dog system. Also, to switch back and forth between one dog use and two dog use, you have to insert a sharp point in the back of the transmitter to reset the whole unit. I decided to go with something better."
1,Transmitter Range Tapers Off,"My brother and I have each purchased this product for our dogs. The range starts out excellent (several hundred yards) but after 6 months or so both of our remotes saw a huge decrease in both battery life and range. I am going to purchase a replacement battery for the remote, but this is the second sportdog product I've owned and they have both had serious issues with battery life and remote range."
5,great product,Highly recommend this item. Waterproof. Batteries and dual charger included so you don't have to constantly replace batteries. I use it for my dog because I do not have a fenced yard and I also like to take her to a beach and let her off leash. She loves to run and this way she can!
5,A must have,"This product is by far the best one out there. I have never had an issue with it working. I honestly don't even shock my dog, I just use the beep button. A must have for any dog. If you can't walk your dog on a leash or just don't want to, buy this collar and in no time you be walking down the block with your dog at your side and no leash"
1,Can only shock dog if you have more than one dog?!?,"I just got this and the Add-A-Collar since I have two dogs, and if I'm reading the manual right, all three buttons on the transmitter do the same thing, shock the dog. I want to be able to train them with the tone and use the shock as a last resort, so if I want to do that, I have to buy another transmitter? How stupid is that?!?"
2,Sportdog Sporthunter SD 800,I initially thought this trainer was a good buy. However after about 6 months I noticed (nearly too late) thatthe trainer was failing at distances over 30 ft. It was originally good for around a half mile. It was completely chargedbut just not working.At the price this is just not acceptable.I have contacted the company but have not received a response as yet.A big disappointment.
1,defective,"I purchased this item for my 5 month lab, and it worked great for 2 days. I read the manual and followed the directions and it was exactly what we wanted to further train our puppy. Yesterday while in the kitchen my dog yelped, and then several seconds later another yelp. then it was constant panic and yelping. I went into shock trying to get the collar off my dog because i realized that the collar was shocking my dog for no reason. It was on tight and in order to get the collar off i had to grab some scissors to get it off. He is now spooked and won't even go back into the kitchen. So what I was trying to establish, has now went into the wrong direction and I'm extremely upset for this. I kept the remote on top of a counter with nothing around it to set if out. I thought this was a great collar but it only takes one mistake to ruin everything. Please use with caution, because it could have happened in the water or somewhere you couldn't get to him fast enough."
4,Really effective in training,"This collar really works. My dog responds really well to it. Some times it won't work, even at short distances, probably due to low battery thought, which would be user error. Not sure. Still, a great product."
3,great product if you do not loose it,The unit does everything it claims. Worked great training and hunting with my German shorthair. However the controller easily comes of the lanyard in the field. Lost the first one and got another only because other brands that have locater tones on the transmitter did not have the ability to be configured the way I had already trained my dog. I made my own backup for the lanyard and it has save my transmitter at least 2 times. Start out with a unit that has a lost receiver locater if you will use it in tall grass!
1,Martha Stewart on Bad Drugs,"The premise of this show holds great potential: a drag queen hosting a Martha Stewart-style show. However, Brini Maxwell is the ""unfunniest"" drag queen that I've ever seen and she walks and talks like she's popped a few downers."
4,Nuzzling with the Noozles,The video was good however it only have two episodes in the vhs but it was still good to watch.
4,Easy to use,We bought this as a requirement for our homestudy. I am not a creative person and this book is perfect for me. It helped me to better understand the purpose of lifebooks. This book is so easy to read and contains lots of templates to help you make a lifebook for your new child.
4,"Great, but best for fost-adopt families","This book has great instructions on how to make this a real, honest memory book for your child and not a scrapbook. If your child is older, has been in foster care, or has issues to work out, this book is a MUST. For infant adoption, it needs a little tweaking. In our case, we'll be making the book include more info on the birthmom, her likes and dislikes, her childhood, etc so our child feels more of a child-centered knowing-ness of her."
5,Great Book,"Making a lifebook seemed like such an overwhelming task - especially since we also kept a journal and made a scrapbook of the trips. But this book was a great help in organizing the thoughts, words and ideas for my daughters lifebook. Although every situation is unique, this book was almost a how-to manual with step-by-step instructions for each page/section. Although it worked well for international adoption, the book also had ideas and sections for foster children, older children and domestic adoptions. In additiona, Beth includes sample pages and helps with wording for tough situations like abuse, neglect, and lack of information on birth parents.Overall a great book, easy to read, full of ideas, and worth every penny!"
2,Disapointing collection from a great singer,"Alas, I was very disapointed with Marc's collection of songs by Bruel. He's a great singer and i love his work, but for some reason, he misses in this case. Looks like you need to stick to the musical and to the excellent Scott Walker."
4,Would have given it 5 stars but..,"It's not as attractive as I'd like a clock to be! It's not ugly, I guess, it's just not a very blendable piece. It's definitely not something you would use for decor! That being said, it works wonderfully. We've had it for quite a few months now and have not had a single problem with it. We have another one (different brand, not the same clock) that no longer works with the outside monitor. I'm hoping this one does better. You do have to be careful where you mount the outside monitor. If you put it in certain areas (like next to metal, or in direct sunlight), it will register as much hotter than it really is. Our house has vinyl siding, and even that puts off enough heat to affect the reading significantly. Also, be warned that this is a rather large clock. You definitely won't have any trouble reading it. Even the information below the time is very easily seen! I really love that this one displays the indoor humidity in addition to the temperature."
3,Plot goes beyond the tired and tried,"The movie is the latest in the the Hollywood bank-kruptcy intellectual captiat development art, using a comic hero for mass appeal. Well Batman has been around for a while. The plot is sensible and does provide plausible explanation for the devices used in Batman. This meant it was more realistic for those who analyze movies. The roof top car chase seen was a stretch. The acting was O.K but not great. A nice flick for adventure, better than most of the canned mass production C rated movie Hollywood has been dishing out.I have an HD 1080P Samsung and the picture was not astonishing, definitely better than standard DVD picture quality of 420P but I have seen better quality (Planet Earth, or Bourne)."
2,Horrible customer service,"In shipping one of my cups broke. I called to have it replaced and they said they would ship it out. I called again and they said ""oops"" and said they would take care of it. They never did. I still use these and they are ok, but they don't keep all of the leaves, etc. from what you are drinking. I'd recommend a tea straw."
2,Liberate the audience,"Department of War films are collected together detailing the First and Ninth Armies' march toward Germany. Interesting documentaries are not packaged together well, as the viewer is overwhelmed with names, dates, and duplicate footage."
3,The actors do well,Why isn't Keaton doing more? He is controlled and mesmerizing. Surely there must be roles for this guy. A watchable entertaining little movie.
4,The Tao of Christianity,"If you are a fundamentalist prepare to have your world rocked. This is a book about being willing to discover what forgiveness is (it isn't what your ego thinks it is) and the faith to hang out in really tough situations until it becomes clear. If you want a three step process to forgiveness, this isn't the book for you. However, if you'd classify yourself as more Zen/Christian---hang on. This is the ""big picture"" forgiveness process. If you've pinned it down it isn't it. What is stressed is our part in removing the emotional blocks to seeing the ever evolving process of forgiveness. Brizee, a shrink and theologian, sees forgiveness (and God) as bigger than us or the situation we're in. He writes some of the most radical Christian stuff going and yet does it in such a gentle style that it's almost crazy. Go for it."
5,Where did this author come form?,Let me just say.....WOW!!! This has got to be the best Star Trek themed book I have read in at least 2 years probably more. Here for the first time in a long while we get to see a novel designed for Klingons and about Klingons facilitated by the use of previously introduced characters from TNG and DS9 episodes. The author has succeeded in creating a universe all his own wonderful story I can't wait to read others in this series
5,A fantastic adventure piece,"As I mentioned in my review for Book 1, this book has repeat value. I can read it a second time and find a level of enjoyment that I can find in very few books.The higher story line is quite straight forward. We could all probably make a good guess at it. But I can bet very few (or none) of us would have been able to write a novel which will grip the reader as much, even though we know or think we know how the story will move.Because of Diplomatic Implausibility and the IKS Gorkon books, Keith R.A. DeCandido is now one of my favourite authors."
4,Continues a compelling story.,Easy read. Good characters. I could have used a bit more tactical detail in the space battles and large scale ground conflicts. It seemed to read at times like a good script for a TV show instead of a novel.This is a great little series though. Kind of like the Wraith Squadron books. Good use of quirky and memorable minor characters to the franchize who become stars in their own right. I'm looking forward to a third book.I'd like to see Klag and the crew of the Gorkon get sent to the Mirror Universe.
3,a good effort,"From 1988, this lp by Culture, while having some great tracks on it, such as ""Jah Rastafari,"" and ""Revolution Time,"" sounds somewhat tired to me. It could be the fact that Joseph Hill, who had left his two partners, was in the midst of a dry spell in his career (which is still going strong despite Culture's continuing isolation from current ragga trends).Whatever the case, this is not a terribly strong Culture effort, and would best be avoided by all but the most devout fans."
1,Summer Infant Tub,"I DO NOT recommend this tub for squirmy babies! My 1 month old had his foot stuck in the side of this tub and screamed until he was purple! It may work for those of you who have calm babies. But if you have a baby who doesn't like bath time, you should probably invest in a different tub."
4,baby bath tub,I ordered this for my grandchild to be.....it'sa great size (room for growing) and the price was great!!
4,Psychic Development for Beginners: An Easy Guide to Releasing and Developing Your Psychic Abilities,"It is what it is, a basic technique/tool for beginners to use. He gives you examples of ""how to"". How to do psychometry(touching an item to reveal a situation), divination (using a string attached to a bolt to determine yes/no answers), using a deck of cards, clairvoyance, different psychic abilities/levels, etc, etc. It covers all areas and a great starter for anyone. For me, I should of used a ""next level"". However, for beginners, this is a good book, clear in understanding to help you seek your psychic abilities."
4,Reading is Entertaining,"The book describes only that, Psychic Development for beginners. This is the first book I have ever read on Psychic Development and have managed to accomplish a few task of the 44 exercises given. I am very pleased Mr. Hewitt did mention in his book about Psychic's not to play doctor and not advising someone to do something against's doctors orders. As I am learning more about Psychic Development I can see why Mr. Hewitt would mention this phrase in his book. Too many Psychic's are pretending to heal the sick with negative results, I can say this with authority because I am in the medical field. I personally feel I can use Psychic abilities in my practice but with limitations. I have seen more than my share of very ill patients who would be alive today, if only Psychic healers knew their true limitations of practice. I will purchase other books by William W Hewitt."
5,Must Have,Anyone interested in developing their psychic abilites need this book. Don't wast time on all the other ones on the market. Save your money and purchase this book and this book only. Then if you feel the need to continue with your abilites you can search for more but this will get you started and on your way.
4,It's okay,"It's an okay book. I did not finish it of course, because it got to boring the author puts too much personal experience instead of actual exercise. But the exercise he does put in is just great. But like I said the only problem with it is that it gets to boring with his own personal stories. I suggest if you want to buy this book then buy it because after all it's a good book. because you always could skip over the personal stories when it gets boring."
4,A Good First Book,This was my first book on the subject of psychic development. I enjoyed it very much and the author displayed a personal touch. The exercises were useful and fun. I would highly recommend this as a first book for everyone.
4,For the absolute beginner only,"A book that anybody can follow with exercises that are easy and practical enough, but not very inspirational. For a complete beginner, who may need to sort out ideas of what it means to be psychic, clairvoyant, clairaudient, or otherwise, this is a good starting point. This is also a good place to start for someone who does not practice meditation or visualization, or someone who needs to be introduced to getting in tune with his senses. For those who understand the basic concepts, but would like to sharpen skill and technique with exercises that will further enhance their psychic senses, something a little more advanced is needed."
1,Waste of precious $$$$,"I bought this book about two years ago and remember waiting excitedly for its arrival. I could not wait to do the exercises and took particular care not to rush through them. To cut to the chase, in spite of my commitment to these exercises, my psychic abilities are still at point zero. This is not a book for the serious wannabe psychic. If you are a psychic junkie like me, learn to spend your dollars wisely. Preview the chapters of the displayed book and use the ""surprise me"" option to get a feel if you connect with the writer and/or the content. Doing this has helped me immensely in giving me an idea of a book's worth. Glowing reviews do not necessarily mean the book is going to be a winner with you. You have to draw your own conclusions."
2,Half could be cut,"Much of this book could be cut out. Too much commentary, too little information. Somewhat boring. You'll be skipping over large sections. The ""case histories"" are hardly relevant. In fact, they're a bit cliche. Much of this book is just repetitive, opinionated filler ""If you ever..."". Well,go ahead and make your lists now - your ""deja vu"" experiences, correct intuition experiences, little voices telling you otherwise. Then do the pendulum and playing card challenges. And the dictionary -this one sounds vague. Definitely for beginners. But if you have even a bit of common sense, interest or insight into the topic, you already know the information in this book."
3,Okay Book!,"This was a nice and fast reading book, it's not book about big mobo jumbo words who mean nothing, it's a easy reading and not a mental torture to read but I found some of the cases he said kind of hard to believe but it can be true. Read this book with an open mind."
1,Common Garden Variety PSI Book,The book is full of the author's anecdotal experiences with no independant verifications cited. The exercises are typical of hypnotic scripts used in guided imagery sessions. In regards to the recreational vehicle problem cited; the author needs to be aware that an engine does not quit running because it has a bad starter?
1,For those who need help with their mistaken belief they have phychic powers,"If you want to make believe you have psychic powers, but are having a hard time culturing or maintaining this mistaken belief, because no one does, this is the book for you. Without wasting much of your time, which is already being wasted on this delusion, you can fill your confused brain with ideas, procedures, practices, etc. which can distract you from actual measurement of your clairvoyant powers, which, of course, would result in blatant proof that none exist. In this way, your self-deception is not only affirmed, but enhanced."
2,"Easy and pleasant read, but not very deep","This is surely a book for beginners. After a few basic mental exercises to easily and quickly go to 'your basic psychic level', the rest of the book is mostly a long list of pleasant case stories intermixed with very short and easy descriptions on how to do something similar - just by asking your higher mind and/or guide/angle for it.I see the value of the book as an appetizer to a potentially wonderful and very pleasant life with just about any power and knowledge one could imagine. But it will probably not make you a psychic unless you are already VERY close. Perhaps one should keep in mind that the author has a background in hypnotherapy and builds somewhat on (self-) suggestion.I bought the book because of some exercises mentioned in a review, and indeed some of them might show up to be beneficial over time. As usual, this will depend more on the student than the teacher. But again, more depth would have been nice."
4,A great beginner's guide!,"If you are looking for some quick and easy exercises to bring out or enhance your innate psychic ability, this is your book. I consider it a ""must-have"" for anyone. I actually read it pretty much in one sitting! The book contains many exercises and meditation techniques which in many cases can be done almost anywhere, anytime. With just a little practice and perserverance, they really do pay off!I did however drop a star because I didn't care for the exercises on getting your own parking space and moving traffic. To me that just seems like inappropriate and unnecessary utilization of your gifts. But that's just my opinion and if I could've just dropped only half a star for it I would've. Anyhoo...Bottom line: I highly recommend buying this book if you are looking for simple psychic development techniques that don't wreak of ""new-agey"" terminology. It's truly a book for the layman...or lay-woman for that matter :)"
3,Psychic Development Insides,"It is a well written book describing how to get access in the inner audience of the mind. Because many people who will read the book do not have the visualization skills explained, the writer should describe where the reader will be after practicing all the exercises mentioned in the book.In general it is a nice book touching the basic levels of psychic development.I would recommend it for the people who would like a trigger of introduction into the psychic nature of human beings."
5,great overall explanation of the subject!,"I am just entering the world of cake decorating and this happened to be the 1st book I skimmed/read! It is wonderful. I was looking for details and that is what I got! Merehurst Ltd even gives a brief history on the subject- which was very interesting! There are lots of different cakes you can make yourself and also detailed pictures and explanations! I just borrowed this book from the library, so I have to return it...but I'll definately be buying it. I think it's a must-have for cake decorators everywhere!"
4,A basic book,"The Essential Guide to Cake Decorating provides beautiful colour illustrated pictures on common sugarcraft flowers and cakes.It also provides the basic requirements for cake decoration e.g. types of equipments used, covering cake using marzipan, royal icing, sugarpaste etc. The book is so well design and has useful step by step instructions to cake deco.Plus the cake pictures makes me keep looking at the book over and over again!"
3,Good Movie - Lame DVD,"I'll keep this short and non-pretentious.I find this film very enjoyable. Although Woody Allen isn't in this film, blatent aspects of his own neurotic behavior leak through John Cusak, and very well. The acting is superb. Jennifer Tilly's Olive must, must, must be an homage to Jeane Hagen's Lina Lamont in ""Singin' in the Rain."" In general, the characters are all hysterical, although the plot is very predictable, especially anything mob-related.As far as the DVD goes, where're all the features that DVDs are loved for most? I looked at the back of the damn thing, at the bright blue ""Special Features"" box, and sighed as I read ""Widescreen."" Wow. Isn't that expected anyway? It might as well have read, ""In Color.""Ah, I'm too harsh. I did enjoy this movie on DVD, but I was definitely let down by the lack of features. Oh, and the sound is really ..., too. 2-Channel! This must be the future!I'm outta here."
2,"DVD lacks features; Situations funny, but dialogue not.","The plot situations are humorous, but the dialogue itself is only ho-hum funny. The truly funny parts are sparse, though the last scene is excellent. The violence is too random and shocking for a ""black comedy"", and only diffuses the plot's focus. Last, the DVD itself has virtually no special features."
2,Enormoulsy funny movie undercut by Allen's preaching,"Bullets Over Broadway has some of the funniest moments in recent cinema. Tracey Ullman, Diane Wiest, and Jennifer Tilly are all outstanding.The problem is Woody Allen's sanctimony and prechiness that slowly infultrates the movie with all it's talk about ""the artist creates his own moral universe.""Sorry Woody. You can't have it both ways. If you don't want your personal life criticized, quit trying to justify it in your movies."
3,Filmed in 1994 Released in 1995 IN MONAURAL?????,"Miramax and Woody Allen did a big dis-service to everyone who bought a ticket or a Laser Disc or a DVD of this film by not filming or releasing it in STEREO sound.I realize some of the music featured in the period of the movie was not recorded in STEREO, however for the rest of the film, and the fact that it was filmed in 1994, and major films from the 50's on have been filmed in STEREO, not recording, or releasing this one in STEREO is a big injustice.How about another release, you could call it ""Special Edition"" or ""Ultimate Edition"", where you provide 5.1 STEREO sound, like many other movie releases have done with movies previously released in monaural or just 2.0 STEREO?Woody......are you listening?????Miramax....are you listening?????Think of the extra money you could rake in with only enhancing the sound!"
5,Very Entertaining Comedy,"I purchased this movie because it is directed by Woody Allen and stars Jennifer Tilly. It is a comedy that takes a light-hearted look at Broadway and the mafia. Being as though my favorite movie genres are comedies and gangster movies, you can imagine how much I enjoyed this one. It's not a hilarious movie, but it is very clever. I'd recommend it to anyone"
1,challanging cut,"I bought this blade along with a higher priced blade Delta 28-964 to find out if it would be usable in my business. I installed the blade and was disapointed at how poor the quality was. The set on the teeth made me skew the work piece about 20 degrees to the side in order to get the blade to cut a straight line. I surely would not want to make a curved cut that required any accuracy. Unfortunatly, I didn't need the blade till after the return period expired or it would have went back. The better blade was installed and it cut just fine without any adjustments to the saw."
1,Bad blades.,"I ordered several Delta band saw blades when I got my new band saw. I thought, how bad can they be? Well, really bad is the answer. All of them. Cutting 3/4"" hard wood was like cutting steel. I got some blades from another vender and it made a world of difference. Don't waste money on Delta blades. Zero would be a better rating."
2,Not as good as the others,"These are mostly all very slow songs and not the type to pump you up for the Christmas season, rather put you to sleep."
2,Christmas Music,"I was very very disappointed with this album would not suggest this one at all for anyone. Not for this house,"
4,Great variety,A collection of 25 songs from all different artists and styles from traditional carols to rock and roll. Great for long car rides or background at a holiday gathering.
2,Meh..,"I'm a fan of Victorinox/Swiss Gear/Wegner products. I don't know why, really. They aren't particularly more durable I find, maybe it's because of the Red T. Anyway, like the other reviewer, bought this bag for $25 at my local Marshalls.I agree that the compartments aren't padded, but the bag's meant to be as thin as possible. My major problem is the Velcro. I feel like they went out of their way to find the loudest Velcro there was on earth. The only reason I've taken note is because I've been in class many times, needing to get something out of the bag, and the loud *crrrrrrip* is disruptive. If I leave the bag open, the Velcro stick to the carpet, which is a softer, but still audible sound.It barely holds more than my laptop and one text book before it becomes noticeable bulky.All in all...I kinda feel like it's a waste of money."
1,Come on EA get with the program,Come on EA get with the program!! Xbox and PS2 is yesterday's technology you need to come out with this game for today's systems Xbox 360 or PS3. What's even worse is you made this game so it is not capatible with the 360 I think that stinks...why not release it for Atari too as I am sure there are some of those systems still around.
4,Good Item,"I purchased this item as a gift to my daughter. The only complaint she had was the size. She previously had one from 1991 or there about, and it was much smaller and easier to carry in her purse. Other than that, she is very happy with it."
4,It's Cool!!!,"My son in whom I got this for says ""it's cool And I like it!"" It works well, A bit larger than I thought."
5,Yellowman's 1983 classic.,"This 1983 release (reissued on CD by Shanachie Records in 1989) was the album that truly made Yellowman a superstar. The all-time classics ""11+11"", ""Shorties"", ""Them a Mad Over Me"", ""Operation Eradication"" and the mellow ""Lover's Corner"" all make this CD a must-have for any true Yellowman fan. As is well-documented, Yellowman influenced such superstar 1980s Hip-Hop legends as RUN-D.M.C., Kurtis Blow and others and this album proves just why this was so."
3,Not what I was expecting!!,"I was very disappointed! The music was easy listening and balad type, not fast paced, boom boom, ""raz a ma taz"", and interesting like I'm thinking circus sounds should be!! Yes, the sounds are very good, just not what I was expecting!!! Probably will not listen to it a second time!!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this cd after watching several Cirque du Soleil performances on the Bravo channel. I was taken with the artistry and beauty and felt that a significant part of the allure of these shows was the music that the action was set to. However, I was sad to find out that the music truly can not stand on its own. It is bland and without energy when you don't have a lively show with energietic performers to watch at the same time. My favorite of the songs and the only one that is really worth mentioning is Alegria, however, the singer voice is rough and doesn't have the fancifull sound that I remembered from the performance.Overall- a disappointing purchase."
3,Expirations,Rented this movie only got to watch half of it. My last rental didn't expire for a week so I thought I had the same amount of time to watch this movie. It expired in only one day. Waste of money amazon. Had to take care of an emergency. Would be nice to know up front when you purchase how long the movie expires in huge pop up text.
4,it was a fun ride,"I recommend this movie. Good acting, good story. Good acting, good story.Good acting, good story. Good acting, good story."
2,The Lingerie Was The Star,"About the only worthwhile thing about this incredibly bad movie was the short scene that involved red lingerie. Fast forward to that, watch it in slow motion a few times, eject movie, you're done. You didn't miss anything. Best laugh? Female negotiator jumps out onto the ledge-- yeah, right...Improbable plot. Wooden acting. Impossible stunts. Crappy direction. Incompetent editing. Great body under lingerie. I will say that the Blu-ray had a great picture quality.Third rate TV movie."
4,MOVIE FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS,If you'd like seeing someone stick it to rich thieving p???ks that greedily hold all the money in this country - this movie is for you!Good edge of seat entertainment. The good guys (working people) get one in the win column.
2,"OK Movie, Terrible streaming experience","The movie itself was OK (worthy of a 3 out of 5 rating), but the Amazon Instant Video experience from my PS3 was terrible. The movie stopped to buffer every 15 minutes. This is not a bandwidth issue, as I tested the connection on other devices and did a speed test (25 MBPS download). Won't be using this service any time soon."
3,Somewhat predictable and pretty unbelievable,"I am not sure what I expected from this movie, and it was ""ok"", but certainly not an action movie that would make my top 10 list. It is certainly not unwatchable, and is worth a rental if there is nothing else that you feel like seeing."
4,Very good,"I was surprised how good this movie was, I would recommend people seeing this.Very entertaining. I would see it again."
2,The man was on a ledge for most of the movie,"This movie was interesting for about the first 10 minutes or so. After that, it was mostly a monologue from a man who crawled on to the ledge of a building. Periodically, the camera would flash to other scenes that were no more interesting than the man on the ledge. Halfway thru the movie I was kind of hoping the man on the ledge would fall off the ledge and put an end to my boredom. The movie preview was sooooo much better than the movie. I recommended skipping this one."
2,Did not hold my interest,"As a lover of the suspense and thriller genre ""Man on a Ledge"" looked like a good Saturday, popcorn, late night movie. It was more of a Lifetime Movie Channel kind of show, very amature. The plot was predictible and trite. The skyscrapper scene, ""I'm gonna jump - here I go..."" crowd gasping...nevermind, just give a cigarette from the gorgeous, I-can-toss-my-hair New York negotiator played by Elizabeth Banks was comical. After watching excellent productions such as ""Breaking Bad"" made this difficult to continue. The movie was stopped midway through. I was very glad I only wasted $3.99 and not more."
2,man on a ledge,I thought it was boring and the plot was just another remake of a similar movie...comon Hollywood....where is your originality??
5,Very well-done and entertaining!,"I enjoyed very much seeing this thriller. It's about a man, Sam Worthington, who wants to clear his name after having been convicted of a crime that he did not commit. He stands on the ledge of a building in order to fulfill a very well-studied plan. I liked very much that the ledge of the building was the ledge of a luxury hotel.The intensity was very good and there was place for romance as well."
3,"Nothing new, but well-done just the same.","There wasn't a lot in this movie that I haven't seen before in other, better films. That said, I was surprised at how engaging it was. The cast and director were really on their game, and I found myself engrossed in this film even when I knew what was going to happen and why. I suppose that speaks extra for the cast and the director: it's one thing to make you intrigued when you don't know what's going to happen; it's an entirely different feat to make you care when you already know.Kudos to them, and well worth a watch!"
4,"Good action flic,",The action and the plot twists will keep your interest. intelligent characters trying to out smart each other through twists and flashbacks.
4,Action thriller,This movie is terrific. Great plot and well-acted at times. Entertaining from start to finish. Genesis Rodriguez is a real beauty. Would highly recommend this movie.
4,Great story twists. Dont watch previews. Just watch the flick.,"Great story twists. Dont watch previews. Just watch the flick. The previews, even the description are filled with spoilers. Trust me. This one is cool!"
4,Really good for a bunch of first-timers!,"A revenge pic also disguised as a heist flick? Count me in! For a movie with a ho-hum title, the story certainly delivers. There are plenty of famous actors and the plot is always one step ahead -- as most heist pics need to be. Newcomer writer Pablo Fenjves wows for a first-time screenwriter, and first-time director Asger Leth keeps the action and suspense tight. Looking for a nice, new original heist pic? Look no further!"
4,Entertaining movie,"Okay, so it is not the best movie I have watched and I doubt it will win any awards, but I enjoyed the experience and was kept interested enough to watch it all the way through.Give it a tree and you just might be surprised."
4,Good,"Good quality streaming. This is an entertaining show. If you like shows like ""The Fugitive,"" you would probably like this show."
3,Lots of action,"This was an action filled drama, but I didn't find I was sitting on the edge of my seat or experiencing sweaty palms. The story line reminded me of 'The Italian Job' and some of it was unlikely, but I would recommend it."
4,Good rental!,"I didn't have a chance to see this at the movies, but as a rental it was very good and entertaining."
3,Man on a Ledge,The packaging was intact but I had difficulty takiog the movie from the packaging and the movie broke so I ordered another one;a used one this time.
1,The acting - ugh,Lots of action and suspense but some of the worst acting I have seen in a long while. The script could have worked with better acting.
1,Man on a Ledge,"I rented 3 movies over a week. All 3 stalled mid movie numerous times. After following Amazon's instructions for a streaming the movie,the problem still occurred. I'm not sure I will use this service again."
4,Pretty good action flick.,"From some published reviews this was supposed to have been a dog. Susprise! It's actually a decent heist flick. It does kind of telegraph the plots twists and turns, but it still holds your intrest."
4,Very well done!,"You will really enjoy this one, especially if you live or work in New York City. The DVD that I rented had a ""making of"" bonus extra which must be viewed also. You will want to watch the movie a second time. Sam Worthington and Jamie Bell have really perfected the American accent. You hear them talking in their natural voices in the bonus extra. Some of the scenes were actually fimed on a ledge at the Roosevelt Hotel. Highly recommended."
3,"Nothing special in this, TV Show-like, action movie","Rented on favorable reviews and yes, it was OK but felt to me like it was a TV movie as it had the same pacing and everything tied up into a nice bow in the last 5 minutes for so. Action is OK, characters OK, plot?? not so much. I liked ""Safe House"" much better as an action movie or ""Salt"". Holds one's attention but just barely. If you can not find anything else to rent, this will do in a pinch."
3,afternoon fluff,"I saw the original trailer and thought....naw. The movie came around as a ""deal"" so I ventured. Way too much backstory that was supposed to bring tension? In the end, you already knew.......it was just a matter of waiting it out. Afternoon movie...and not ""movie night"" fare..."
4,An okay plot,I was hesitant to watch it at first. I like the plot and numerous twists. I enjoyed watching this movie.
4,Great for Home Viewing,"The 4 stars is based on viewing this film on Amazon Prime at home- I would not have wanted to pay traditional movie prices - but it was certainly enjoyable enough for an at home evening viewing.The beginning was a little slow -but it definitely started to pick up at the end - of course, you have to wonder how the characters got all those 'special forces like' skills, but if you don't think to much about the details - it's worth watching."
3,Man on a Ledge,Not the best but somewhat entertaining. Had a lot of big name actors so we thought it would be a bit better.
5,Man on a ledge,I am pleased with my purchase Man on a Ledge . My whole family enjoyed viewing the movie and we have watched it again since we purchased it .
4,Man on a Ledge,"This is a great action movie and would recommend it for older teens and adults - no small children. It was well played, not knowing exactly what was going to happen from one moment to the next. I would recomment it and would rent it but not buy it. Good movie for entertainment!"
5,Surprisingly great movie!,"Man on a Ledge was underrated at the box office.Thrilling concept!! The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering if he will jump!!Classic bank robbery movie now!"
5,Awesome movie!!!,Movie started slow. . . but ended with a bang! The relationships in the movie did not become apparent until close to the end. You have to watch this movie to know what I'm talking about. Highly recommended movie.
5,Wow movie,This is one of the very best movies I have viewed. It was intense and the acting was excellent. I recommend
5,Terrific plot!,Loved the suspenseful plot which kept you guessing at the nature of the crime and its ultimate resolution. The characters were great and played out a well done production in New York.
5,Great plot,"I was a little surprised by this movie. The story was very well written, it had great twists from begining to end. If you are looking for a edge if your seat thriller then this movies for you."
3,An Entertaining Movie,"This movie was pretty good. I liked the story line, but the ending was a bit predictable, at least for me. Even so it kept me on the edge of my seat and the acting was well done."
3,man on a ledge,This was a filme that turned out to be much more exciting than my expectation based on the title of the film. It is worthy of a rental and will provide worthwhile entertainment.
3,Good -- not great movie,Interesting premise for an apparent suicide attempt. The action generally moves swiftly but some aspects of the storyline stretch believability. Great watch for minimal cost -- certainly not worthy of full price at theater.
4,We liked it.,"We thought that it was a great thriller, not knowing where it was headed, but when we could see what was being done, then it became a race for time for us to see how it would end. I thought the actors were great and they supported each other very well."
3,Wait till on Cable,I saw this movie 2 months ago. Here's how good it is. I don't remember. But I don't remember it being bad either.
3,It made me think of Phonebooth.,"Remember phonebooth? Although it was different, it made me feel like I was watching it all over again. Worth a rent, not a buy."
4,Man on a Ledge,Good Movie. Kept me wondering how the story line was developing. Not predictable and liked Sam Worthington in the lead role.
2,Stream of consciousness to the Nth degree,"This book is just ""ok."" As far as the topic goes, many other books have been written about it, including and especially Your Money or Your Life, by Dominguez and Robin. This book covers the same concept, but is lean on facts, heavy on personal anecdotes, and the stream of consciousness writing seems to go on and on. I barely finished the book."
2,not recommended,"Has a high annoying sound when you open the water, I thought that the brass part would look nice, but it didn't, since it's kind of hidden in the back and you don't really see it."
5,Faucet Talk,"No defects noted for both units. One installed yesterday, the other being installed today. First-installed works well. The handle is much easier to use than the acrylic knob on the former Delta faucet."
5,Bible for Architects,"This book is the most comprehensive reference that addresses some of the most important concepts that are fundamental to architectural design. All the issues are dealt with in considerable detail. An awesome design reference, this book never leaves my desk. Combining the experience and lessons from ancient architecture to the most modern technologies, this book teaches good, effective and environment friendly design with solid reasoning and examples. There is often a quantitative base to the theory as well, which makes the measurement of benefits clear and defined."
4,Good tool to have,"I used the hook end to seat the parking brake retaining springs on my car. It is a very tight fit in the limited space behind the rear wheel hubs inside the brake shoes. I'm glad to have this tool on hand. Tried using vice grip, etc and fought with it for 30min, the right tool makes all the difference."
1,useless garbage,"If it was only so easy.. Don't waste your time with this proven huckster. If you want more in depth advice check out his earlier book: 'Think Astrology & Grow Rich: With the New ""Money Astrology""'. Yes he really wrote that"
3,An decent introduction. Read Carlson instead.,"A decent introduction if you can't get a hold of Carlson's ""Eight Steps to Seven Figures."" I think Carlson's book was better and more inspirational. But this did introduce me to Dilbert's Anti-Weasel Defense Portfolio, and that should count for something.Personally I would just read Carlson instead, then Dilbert's Anti-Weasel Defense Portfolio, and know that this book just reinforces those methods with the advice of 50-75% no-load index stock funds and 25%-50% bonds in a 401k or IRA every month.Josh Sowinfireandknowledge.org"
3,"amusing, fluffy, not essential","I agree with reviewer ""mthoran"" on substance, although the book didn't raise my ire quite so much. It's an amusing, fluffy-light book, repetitious to a fault perhaps, but it does point the reader in the right directions.Maybe the best recommendation is: don't buy the book, borrow it from the library or a friend, read it quickly (skimming a lot) and then move on to books with more substance.At least it won't hurt you. There are many investing books that will."
1,"If you're new to investing, avoid!!!","What is he talking about?! He assumes we all understand these ""terms"" already, without starting from the beginning. He starts off the intro telling us to sit and relax, enjoy this and that... 4 TIMES in a few pages. Then, he rips apart others who build up hype, which is exactly what he does. I'm glad this came from the library. This book was meant to be simple. It, like so many others, makes the reader feel stupid."
3,so-so book,"Was looking for a quick way to make a buck, Book was somewhat helpful in giving some ideas. Figured a few bucks for a used book I couldn't loose."
2,Good beginner advice. Lack of details frustrating.,"The advice is very standard - buy index funds and diversify. Not enough data to evaluate which portfollio to pursue - relative rates of return, relative volativity, relative tax liability. Needs more data on how to follow a portfollio if you already have one, and more data needed on how to best re-balance.Instead get the data free at Paul's web site: ""Three 'lazy' portfolios still big winners Keeping it simple doesn't mean returns have to lag"" By Paul B. Farrell, CBS.MarketWatch.comLast Update: 8:00 PM ET Jan 28, 2004Or http://www.coffeehouseinvestor.com/Or http://www.dallasnews.com/business/scottburns/Sorry I spent money on the book, as I heard all of this on his web pages."
4,A Unique Blend of Aural Slush and Desert Mirage,"Yeah, definitely not your father's Tex-Mex... sort of what you might expect to find if you walked into a sleazy piano lounge in the middle of the desert. Townes Van Zandt meets Tom Waits meets Yo La Tengo, in an ""emo"" sort of vein. Not all slow, dreamy stuff though -- good for that drive through your favorite wasteland, be it natural or industrial.For guys who like Lisa Germano's stuff, you'll love this. Makes me want to ride off into the sunset and find more recordings by all the artists who met on the astral plane for this one..."
4,all of you listen state of grace you like it(hardest),t's a good album. advice you state of grace track. t is a real hardcore.now download t
2,NOT the same media as 25 pack or 100 pack!,"I just received a 50 pack of the 4x Ridata +R media and checked the description in DVDINFOPRO. As ""Crappiest Media Made"" noted, these are not the RICOHJPN but instead RITEK-R03. I have had 2 coasters out of the first 25 disks. Not acceptable considering I had a 100% success rate with the 'older' RICOHJPN. I have to assume that in fact these are reject 8x media. Who can you trust anymore?"
2,Great Cost Gets Your Attention BUT...Product didn't Work,I bought the 50 pack definitely for the price and the specs seemed to be ok. I got them and had them on reserve for when my current supply of a different brand runs out. Finally I went to use a disk out of the 50 pack in this years model of the Panaonic Home DVD Recorder. Not one single disk out of the top five was detected by the recorder. Now I am stuck with useless disks since my return date is passed with Amazon and I can't get a refund. Now I am glad I paid so little for them.
3,Anyone else not get this to burn at 4X,I bought these thinking that I could use them in my Dell PC with a NEC 2100AD 8X DVD +R/+RW writer. For some reason in NERO 6.0 the will only show up at 2.4X. I don't know if these are defective or packaged improperly but I can't get it to work.
5,This book has my vote for the Hugo Award this year!,"I wish this book would come true! Sawyer's depiction of a loving family, torn apart from within, is packed with emotion. But the trip through the emotional minefield is worth the ride! The ""sense of wonder"" uplifting ending is just incredible! And somehow, Sawyer gets the science in there too. The story of Cheetah, the AI who wants to be human, touched me more than I expected. This is the best book of 1998!"
4,An Unexpected Delight -- well worth reading,"Sawyer has a way of taking a standard science fiction topic and handling it in a totally unexpected manner. This book has so much in it: first contact, Gaia, Jungian psychology, solid characters you care about, recovered memory theory, and much more. Yet he manages to weave a coherent story that pulls you in and keeps you interested and reading.The failing of the book as in several others by this author is that the end sort of fizzles. While the ending fits it's usally a quick pulling together of the plot threads that leaves the reader sort of feeling let down after the richness of the rest of the story."
5,The first memorable bit of sci fi in years,So many ideas crammed into so little space. This is a really thought-provoking read and one of the few positive future scenarios that comes across as genuinely gripping.
2,"Good concepts, flawed by unenjoyable execution","A thoroughly unenjoyable book. The premise is fairly interesting (cryptic alien messages arriving on Earth suddenly stop one day) but is brought (very) low by painfully unbelievable plot advancement (lots of crazy ""whoa, wait - what?"" eureka moments), psycho-new-age mumbo-jumbo meets math nerdiness, all wrapped up in a ham-handed happy bow (spoiler: everything works out)! The least enjoyable aspect, however, was the unreadable characters...it was as if they were written by one of the aliens in the book (a ""Centaur"") - who had researched hum-man-be-ings from the ""overmind"" but had never actually witnessed one."
3,Interesting story more new age that sci fi,I was somewhat disappointed with this book when I began reading it. There is some science here but in the end it turns into a new age book. I will say that its refreshing to see a positive view of the future.
2,At best average,"I found the book too clever by half. Heather's remarkable grasp of N-dimensional math didn't ring true, nor did Kyle's agony over the possiblity that it was his own memories that were repressed. There is plenty of plot, but woefully inadequate character development."
2,Not to plausible,"Sawyer paints the fourth dimension as something easily experienced like some kind of fractal screen saver program where you can view peoples memories like so many VCR tapes. The protagonists are able to pop in and out of 4D with no lasting effect. The heroine is supposedly ""experiencing"" other peoples minds, yet she simply reacts to their thoughts as though she were reading their minds. She doesn't actually become that person and feel what they feel. If she did she would be totally sympathetic to each of them while she was ""in their heads."" The""overmind"" is presented with out causality. Why should it exist at all? Why would it ""back up"" peoples minds after they died if there is no existence after death? Apparently the entire structure of the universe formed itself in a particular way just so one of the characters could be cleared of incest allegations."
3,"interesting idea, poor execution","The basic premise of the book is interesting: a signal comes to us from space, and we have no idea what it means. One day, the signal stops. One scientist, a psychologist named Heather Davis, figures it out, and we explore the implications.Great idea. The execution, however, is lacking. The subplot about the accusations of sexual abuse is so poorly-done to make my skin crawl. Heather's use of her discovery, and her revelations surrounding it, are either entirely too simplistic or so far-fetched to be unreadable.Although disappointing, the book is certainly readable. Consider it light fare to get you through a cross-country air journey, or perhaps something to read while sitting in a doctor's waiting room."
3,Read In Paperback,This is my least liked book by Mr. Sawyer. The general story line was a good one and I enjoyed the physics involved. I thought the husband and wife team was to contrived for the story and wished the two characters had not been married. I felt the abuse part of the story not even germane to the over all story and felt it was added as filler. The book is worth reading but not at the hard back price!
1,A sorry book from a writer who has lost his edge,"Bob Sawyer has apparently his edge since he's gone from some fairly interesting -- if derivative -- dinosaur-mystery style books to this kind of false-science book dealing with ""overminds"" and other pop-pysch stuff like induced memories. His characters in early books didn't need to carry so much of the load because the plotting was tight; in Factoring Humanity the plot has holes you could drive a truck through and the wimpy, angst-driven, self-indulgent characters seem a missed try for the best-seller fluffpile. Worse, even the language level seems to have fallen to that of your average TV commercial, a real disappointment after the relatively literate writing he began with. Perhaps Mr. S should slow down and take his time with his books, because this was a very disappointing read, especially the attempt at a heart-wringing close."
4,Contact Again?,"This Sawyer book could have been the result of a writing contest. I have a mental image of him pulling two pieces of paper out of a bag, and he must write a novel about these two things. One paper says [Man unjustly accused of molesting his daughters] and the other says [Earth receives message from outer space]. I found the novel very enjoyable, a quick read, but not dumbed-down like a lot of fiction these days. I couldn't help but notice the similarities to Carl Sagan's CONTACT: a message from an extraterrestrial civilization with instructions for a machine to be built. In fact, this is the fourth or fifth Sawyer book I've read and I dimly recall him mentioning Sagan several times. I must agree with other reviewers that the characters were flat and cliched. Sitting here now the only character I can remember with any distinction is Cheetah, the artificial intelligence computer."
2,"Great New Age Book, Bad Sci-Fi Book","The entire time I was reading this book I kept wondering when the Sci-Fi would kick in. I was still waiting when I finsihed the last page. This can only be described as sience fiction in the most liberal sense -this is new age, mysticism, et al. If I were intertested in those topics perhaps I wouldn't feel cheated out of my purchase price."
4,Science fiction with the emphasis placed on Science,"This is my fourth Sawyer book in the past month. I stumbled on 'Hominids,' having not read any science fiction in years, and was sold. The reason I sought out more Sawyer is that he uses real science to spin his tales. And he's a good storyteller, too. His characters are a little cardboard but a heckuva lot better than those of some writers I remember.This one is a riff on the notion of aliens contacting us via coded digitized messages from a planet circling Alpha Centauri. So there is cryptography, psychology, engineering, computer science - all written about credibly - brought into play. It makes for a fast-moving read that requires the reader to pause occasionally and really THINK about the possibility of it all.Sawyer deserves credit for writing stories that go beyond current science in a way that remains credible and, perhaps as important, serious.Scott Morrison"
3,CONTACT meets BEAUTIFUL ?,"I tought I was reading Science-Fiction,and I felt plunged in a Barbara Cartland plot.The scientific part,aside from the family dysfunction story,is good,though. But the human interest part is implausible,to say the least. And how could a family doctor and friend counsel such a deranged psychiatrist to a person in his care ? Please,Robert,stick to science."
4,An excellent inspiration for the black man. Freedom Train,"An excellent inspiration for the black man in search of freedom, first and foremost, from his own mind! This is the mind that doesn't aspire for the higher level, the mind that holds us back! Freedom, cry freedom ..... down with Tyranny, down with Moi, down with Mobutu, down with Hitler"
5,Unrestricted energy,"Bo Sullivan and the Turnpike are bundles of unrestricted energy. The New Jersey Turnpike shapes the state. The road is a triumph of function over form. It is the busiest toll road in the nation.New Jersey is a machine in the garden. The nickname, the Garden State, is, in some respects, bizarre.On the New Jersey Turnpike the patrons are treated like vagrants. The message is keep moving. The Turnpike was profitable from the beginning. It sold time and convenience.The Pulaski Skyway has been dubbed America's first cosmic road.To any student of culture, this book is a marvel."
5,Fun!,"This five-song gem is a delight! The lyrics will put a smile on your face, and the nifty guitar and sax solos with put a jig in your hips. It's only 14 minutes long, but while it lasts it's pretty much perfect. Years ago I gave it to a friend who told me recently he still listens to it because ""It's just plain good."""
3,Not essential even for hardcore Westerberg fans,"This isn't a bad little collection of songs but I could've done without them and I'm as big a Westerberg fan as there is. These tunes just seem a little half-hearted to me. Not bad, though, just not in the same league as this genius's best or better work."
3,Young Elvis Clips With Poor Video & Sound Quality,"I received the Amvest Video version of Young Elvis. The Amvest version has poor quality sound and video. It is enjoyable to see Elvis early in his career. However, be advised that at least in terms of the Advest Version that I received the quality of the sound and video is almost unwatchable. Perhaps there are other versions of Young Elvis available with a higher quality presentation."
5,Great but gone,"This is the longest wearing, true to color, fantastic lip product I've ever used. (I'm over 50, I've used A LOT!) I have used it for years! Of course what was once a $5.00 product is now $13, because THEY'RE NOT MAKING IT ANYMORE!! Another case of finding a wonderful product only to have the manufacturer kill it. I admit to hoarding this stuff, even buying it at 3 times the original price just to have the last few remaining."
3,Good if you plan to start a decent size business,"This book really focuses on larger, more franchise like coffee shops. If you have dreams of opening a small coffee bar in your town it's possible this book goes above and beyond what you need."
4,Great Info,"This book was great source for info. Not just on coffee biz but in general. I really liked it. Thanks,"
5,Really helpful,"Organized in a simple to comprehend and use manner, this book is likely to be beneficial to anyone who is thinking about opening a coffee or tea shop. It starts by helping to clarify the all important business plan. Chapters follow a logical sequence which helps someone who is new to the business to fully understand everything that is involved.This book helps the reader prioritize all of the different steps that are needed in order to begin a thriving business. It covers the basics of buying the product, equipments, and how to figure out pricing of the items. CD-ROM is choked full of many different forms which are needed in order to run the business smoothly.The book also completely covers the basics which are needed in any business, including employees, customers, marketing strategies, bookkeeping, and laws and regulations. Easy to read and simple to follow, this book will help anyone who wants to start a coffee or teas shop."
4,"Pat's review of ""How to open a Successful Coffee, Expresso...""","A good book. Lots of good information for a first time business owner. Gave me information on things I would not have thought of, given I've never run a business before."
5,"Short, Sweet & to the point w/ handy practical advice.","This is a great book chock full of ""to the point"" advice.I like the fact that you can use it not only as a ""reading"" book but also a ""reference"" book."
3,Difficult read,"This was difficult to read because the author skips around in Kiplings life so It was difficult to follow the sequence of events. Kipling was such an interesting person, I am looking for his official biography written by Carrington."
2,good start... fades in middle,"Mr. Ricketts begins well. Kipling's ancestors are well drawn. His first years in India are well done. The years back in England when he was 7-17(roughly) are very well written. The first years as a journalist back in India, when Kipling had great success with poems and stories, is well doen too. So, the first 140 pages are useful. Then the book gets really boring. Kipling leaves India, circles the world and lives in Englamnd then the US. It's really boring. Mr Ricketts seemed to run out of energy. So read the first part and skip the last."
5,Great Fish oil,"Now foods omega-3 fish oil has a very good mild lemony fish oil flavor and noticed the benefits after taking this product a few months. I had 1-2 burps, which did not bother me at all and only lasted about 15 minutes, due to the great lemon flavor added to the fish oil. Burping lemon flavor is a whole lot better than just burping plan ol fish oil.. I will continue to purchase this fish oil from NOW Foods Company. :)"
3,"Ni chicha, ni limonada","Soy un admirador de Agatha Christie, y particularmente de Hércules Poirot. Sin embargo, creo que el encanto de las obras de Christie reside en la profusa caracterización de sus personajes y sendas descripciones de las situaciones. De este modo, nos sumergimos en el universo creado por Christie y nos empapamos de la situación. Nos hacemos partícipes de la labor de resolver el crimen. En los relatos cortos, este encanto se pierde. La brevedad no es definitamente un aliado de las obras de Agatha Christie. Sin embargo, si uno desea una introducción a Hércules Poirot y al mundo de Agatha Christie, y no tiene paciencia para leer un libro más extenso, creo que puede ser una opción muy interesante."
3,THIS DADO SET IS NOT FOR ME,"I BOUGHT THIS DADO BLADE BACK IN JULY AND IT CUTS A LITTLE ROUGH. THE BIGGEST PROBLEM I HAVE WITH THIS BLADE IS THE BOTTOM OF THE CUT. IT LOOKS LIKE THE NEW YORK SKY-LINE. I SENT IT BACK TO DELTA AND THEY REPLACED IT WITH A NEW. GUESS WHAT? SAME PROBLEM. AT... . THIS IS A GOOD PRICE, BUT I'M GOING TO SPEND ... MORE AND PURCHASE A FREUD 8"" SUPER DADO SET. YOU REALLY DO GET WHAT YOU PAID FOR. HOPE THIS HELPS ANYONE."
1,Get the Freud instead,I bought this blade a little over a year ago and it's one of the biggest wastes of money that I've ever seen. Cuts through solid wood are only fair but the cuts through plywood leave a lot of tear out and the bottom is uneven and very rough. If you look closely at the picture you will see that there is a small plate attached to the inside of both the outter blades. I though these were a machined on integral part of the blade. NOT!! They are simply glued on as I discovered when one fell off. The quality of construction on this dado is way below par. Spend the extra money and get a Freud or Forrest(if you really have the extra dough). You will not regret it as I now do.
4,good dado for the money,"i've had this dado set for over a year.i read all the other reviews,boy do some poeple knock it.the first few cuts i made were terrible too. but what i decided to do was buy a real shim kit & throw away that cardboard junk that came with it.shim kits are cheap.since then all the dado's are great.hard wood,soft wood,laminates,ect.also use your head & align the cutters equaly in the gullets of the outer blades,if they are not equally aligned around the blade & the 2 outer blades are not ligned up to each other,you will also have a poor cut.if i had the money to buy the freud super dado i probably would have,but after using this set why bother!!it is just fine.it has produced some beautiful stained cabinets out of oak & cherry.so save your money & get this set!! just remember to toss the cardboard shims!!"
1,Not worth the money.,"The 8"" Delta stacked dado is dismal. I set it up to make a 1/4"" box joint. Could probably have done better with a chisel. One of the outer blades is a larger diameter than the other, making a ragged bottom in the groove. Tried the same thing set at 3/8"". Joint wouldn't fit right. Turns out the dado is really about .42"" wide. Further setups revealed the chippers are not a uniform diameter. Don't waste your money on this. Spend it on a good one, like maybe a Freud or a Jesada. You pay for what you get. I wasted (my money) on this. I'm going back to my old Craftsman 7"" wobble-head dado. The Delta may become an anchor for my boat. Maybe it can do that right!"
2,Won't Stay in Place,"Disappointed that the sleeve won't stay in place--slips down to the knee (or below). I measured for size as directed, and ordered the medium. Guess I needed the small."
2,Doesn't stay in position,Tends to drift down your thigh when doing faster workouts. The Chinese made inner lining doesn't breathe but it is warm on cold days.
5,Great Product!!,"I bought this product for my grandfather because he had hip surgery and needed a thigh sleeve to help support his leg. He enjoys wearing it because it puts just the right amount of tension for his leg. He says it was the best thing that he could have gotten to help him. He wears it everyday, for about 8 hours or everytime he goes out, ""which pretty much is everyday""Highly recommend for people that need a little support on their thigh."
2,Too old and too strained.,"Being a long time fan of Ronnie James Dio this performance was very difficult to watch. I realize he is in his early sixties now but the voice is strained and the performance shabby. Just to be sure I went back and listened to ""Live Evil"" from the early eighties. He was so powerful then. Fortuitiously for me, I saw Dio several times in this period, solo and with Black Sabbath. This performance was an embarrasment (like watching a train wreck). It truly saddened me. Save your money."
2,HEAVY METAL IDOL,"A great DVD, great performance from all the band, great drum solo, great sound, I saw them live in july, it was the same show, the best live show I ever seen in Bolivia. Long live rock n`roll...."
3,Holy Mud,"Not what I was expecting. Didn't do my homework. Who are these guys? Where is Vivian Campbell, etc? This is the worst sound on Blu-ray I have heard to date. Muddy in the extreme. The balance is way off to the right. Rear channels are just a whisper. Keyboards are totally buried in the mix. It's still Dio but not the band I would have wanted to see or hear for my money. A pale imitation."
3,Rainbow rising?,"I purchased this DVD at the same time I bought the new Rainbow Live in Munich 1977 DVD, which is awesome. But seeing that Rainbow DVD first ruined this one for me. Granted, you have to admire Ronnie for still belting out the songs and touring at his age, but his voice is definitely worn out. After seeing the incredible ""music video"" version of Gates of Babylon on the Rainbow DVD, the version here just didn't come close. I would recommend Rainbow DVD and the the Philly '84 concert DVD over this one for someone who wants to get a glimpse of Dio at his peak. What I'm really waiting for is a DVD of Black Sabbath's Mob Rules tour. Long Live Rock and Roll!"
3,Blu-ray quality average at best,Obviously the performance is outstanding. If you are a DIO fan - you'll not be disappointed. If you are looking for high quality audio and video...don't bother. It's average at best. Seriously.
3,worth a look,"While this DVD is pretty enjoyable and it's cool to finally hear songs like ""Caught in the Middle"" live, the toughest part to listen to is actually Dio's voice. Granted, he sings better than most other senior citizens, but some of the real vocal highlights from the Holy Diver album (basically the higher range stuff)just aren't there. Ah well. Definitely still worth 13 bucks."
5,Excellent presentation,"This is the first BluRay concert I've seen and I am well impressed with the image quality over a regular DVD. I was also really impressed with how this is a modern rock show and yet the lighting rig was made up mostly of polished aluminum par cans. This was a rare treat since most productions of this type have all switched to LEDs, moving lights, and lame video screens. Its a pitty this man isn't around to make future bluray concerts. On the bright side this is one of the best I've seen. I think this disc eclipses the ""Sacred Heart"" DVD even though the event production isn't as over the top here."
5,Master teaching to sing! Unforgettable!,Fantastic record of the master DIO. The heavy metal singer who imposed his voice to the world and showed how to make real rock and roll. Rest in peace.
1,"Mick Wall, you suck......","The book is okay, it gives a little background to the members of Maiden. Other then that it blows major chunks. I am like the other reviewer, get a couple cds, let the music speak for it self, warning stay away from Dance Of Death, Virtual XI, X Factor, Fear Of The Dark, and No Prayer for the Dying!!"
4,Calling all trekies,This is a wonderful cd. The songs made me feel like I was at a thundercon convention. Spock and Captain Kirk were flying on my 3D chess board. Cul De Sac transported me onto the deck of the starship Enterprise. If you love Star Trek like I do this album is a can't miss.
3,I Know my Hot Dog,"This is the only CD by Foetus that I own on which he goes by a name other than ""Scraping Foetus off the Wheel"". I think the music is all really good, and the songs are rather lengthy which I always enjoy, but this Lydia Lunch character is rather annoying. I know she is someone famous apparently but I'm not familiar with anything else she's done. Her voice doesn't mix well with the orchestration. She sounds like an old woman droning on and on about nothing. Thirlwell contributes some vocals of his own but they're little more than background moans and growls. This would have worked a lot better as an instrumental. It's like bad Throbbing Gristle."
1,"Please, spare me...","Undramatic, unexciting, unfunny, unentertaining, unbearable... Matt and Ed, what is the problem here? From ""Saving Private Ryan"" to this Damon? And Mr. Norton, winning a Golden Globe and Oscar nom for ""Primal Fear"" didn't teach you better. Oh well... As for John Dahl, ""The Last Seduction"" was your last great movie. If you want to make more movies like ""Rounders"" go work with Jean Claude at his 'straight to video' studio. And Miramax! Have you no shame! Leave these corny cliche flicks to the big studios. Give us more ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Sling Blade"" and (yes, even more) trendy teen horror flicks. Please, don't insult us with good looking guys hustling poker games...""I've seen better film on teeth."" (Delroy Lindo, ""Get Shorty"")"
4,Classic movie for people who love poker,"Rounders is a great movie for those people who love the game of poker. This classic tale of an underdog has a little bit of everything in it. Drama, romance and an interesting plot line. The Blu-ray version is great for high-def viewing. A great movie to have in your collection."
2,Maybe it would help if I was a bigger fan of poker...,"Another Ed Norton movie, this one also starring Matt Damon. And John Malkovich, although I almost didn't recognize him at first. Problem is, I'm not a fan of poker or gambling, and none of the characters are particularly likable, so this did little for me."
5,Excellent Movie.,"This is an excellent movie with great performances by the actors. It is not the dirty gambling that everybody knows, it is a movie of the clean way of gambling. Honesty and friendship are two messages conveyed by the director in a very clever way. Look specificaly in the scene where John Malkovich pays him all the money Matt made just because he won playing clean with no cheats, this is honesty. One could not beleive that a mafia man could pay after that incredible gambling night! You can see friendship expressed clearly when Matt always helped Edward with his problems. This is a movie that deservers two thumbs up (I wished I had more)."
4,Realist portrayal of the underground poker scene.,I was amazed to find such a realistic view of poker players and their lifestyles. The tech people on this movie must be commended.
4,Great Poker Movie,Rounders is a great movie about the underground poker clubs in NY.I do what it at least once a year.
4,DEUCES ARE WILD?,"Return with us now to the good old days, when Matt Damon was cast in a realistic, well acted,entertaining movie. I even detected a tinge of the 1961 classic,""The Hustler"", as Damon casts aside all around him, including his girlfriend, to try to make it big as a poker hero. No Law School for this young gamblerholic,despite constant pressure, both pro and con. He's young, he's aware of the dangers involved, and in the end he's taking 44 grand to Las Vegas to test himself against the pros out west, after nearly losing his life to Russian mobsters in New York. There's something to be said for risk taking at a young age, especially here where drugs and drinking seem not to be a problem. He's doing what he wants to do, he's not tied down romantically, he's just approaching his prime, gamblerholics anonymous be damned; Matt's going for it while he still can. I suspect that many viewers wish they were also in his shoes, for better or worse."
3,"Quite good fun, overall","Edward Norton is always welcome even if he does go AWOL leaving us with Mr Charisma bye-pass and Mr Ham and poached doing a Russkie (I've got the moves, chief!)There's a lot of chin wag in this film, much of which I suspect will leave even the 5 card stud brigade scratching their heads."
2,Forget about Matt Damon,"He's not a great actor. In fact, he pretty much sucks and ruined Rounders for me. John Turturro should be receiving all the praise for this film. He is always excellent and saved a good story from Damon's acting."
5,Just a big smile?,"I hope you are not reading this to find out my opinion about Rounders because I'm sorry-I've never seen the movie. I just wanted to see what others thought of it to see if it was worth watching. Then it happened.. I read someones review and they said and I quote,""Matt Damon belongs in no more movies"" or something like that. He is nothing but a big smile???Two words for ya... Bourne Identity! He is excellent in that movie nd we know its not his big beautiful smile that carries the movie cuz he only smiles twice. Hey, my dad actually liked it! Now thats sayin' alot. I'm sorry I haven't seen Rounders and so therefore I have nothing to say about it-actually I do, forget Rounders! Watch Bourne Identity!Ps. I gave 5 stars because 5 is the best and Damon is the best."
5,Love this movie!,"It's one of my favorite movies in the last ten years (another is ""Suicide Kings""). Great acting by all. Well cast.Mostly wanted to comment about Malkovich as a few commented on his ""poor"" Russian accent while another said, ""Malkovich invents his own odd version of the Russian accent . . .""Having spent months in Ukraine, Russia, and Belarus, one of the things I like BEST about this movie is Malkovich' *exceptional* portrayal of a Russian immigrant ""connected all the way to the top"". I've never seen it done better.Russians don't say ""okay""; they say ""ahkyey"". It's not ""to the bettor""; it's ""to the byettor"". Etc.To those who don't buy Malkovich in this role, I'll simply quote what he said: ""Yeb tvaiu mat!""."
4,How Hard Core Gambling is Really Done.....,"Good flick. I learned a lot about how the big time card players play... And why...Card Counting, Shuffling, Cheating.....It's all there. Matt Damon was superb as the gambling addict trying to kick the habit. His close friend talks him into one more round. The risks are high, both money and personal.Interesting flick. Not a lot a real action, but an intelligent film. You really have to pay attention to keep up."
4,Interesting,"Great movie, with a good cast. Teddy KGB is a riot and if you're not playing Texas Hold-em after watching this, you must be a vegitable."
4,An artistic view on a popular sin,"Rounders is an amazing movie that delves into the deep life of a smart street poker player. For those who actually know how to play poker, this movie will be very exciting even without all of the non-poker scenes. For those who do not know how to play poker, Matt Damon's struggle to be something he's not will enthrall you. The only problem that I have with this movie is how annoying Edward Norton's character can be. Every 5 minutes he does something wrong and then apologizes, i feel like grabbing him and saying, why dont u stop apologizing and just stop being an idiot. But the movie is still excellent and should be a treat for many."
3,Just okay.,"I've seen this flick yesterday with my bro.My friends told me to never watch this movie.They told me it was realy borring.But the answer was yes.Rounders was an alright movie.It has a few technical words,but it was okay.It wasn't that entertaining,and I liked the style of this movie.(Except acting)But before you see this flick,I think you'll have to learn about poker."
3,Christmas present,Bought the movie as a Christmas present. It arrived in good time and the person who recieved it said it works great. No problems.
4,Nice Return,"The first one sent was broken, but I selected return and even before I sent the broken one back I had the new one. Very nice service, and nicely done. I sent back the old one the broken one that same day I received the new one and it was super easy, just slap on the label and drop it in the UPS drop. Very efficient. I like Amazon service."
5,this movie is a must have,This movie is very entertaining and a good watch. If your into poker this movie needs to be part of your collection.
4,SURPRISINGLY EFFECTIVE,"I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie, which at first smelled like too much of a Hollywood ""let's get two hot actors-du-jour and put them in a movie targeted to cool people in their 20's"" type-deal. However, Ed Norton gives what I consider to be his best performance ever and Matt Damon delivers too. Also, I have to say the girl who plays Matt Damon's girlfriend, Gretchen Mol, is unbelievably sexy. If any of you guys (or gay girls) have a thing for the spoiled rich girl type, she is your dream girl. The other great thing about the movie is that it celebrates the freedom of the individual - Damon's character ultimately chooses to risk it all, and that's an exciting thing to leave the theater with. The movie has an uncanny knack of making you feel free - and how can you beat that?"
5,Poker Players Only?,"There seems to be mixed reviews about this movie. One either likes it or has very little if any response. I'm a poker player and I loved the story and the cast is excellent. If you like poker as well as suspense, I believe this film will be very satisfying to you. If you don't fit that description, it's still worth a look."
5,"Creative, Innovative, Fun Music!",Listen to the album a few times - you'll find yourself a Spider Nick fan in no time!
3,The Wisest Man That Ever Lived?,"Yul Brynner's role reminds me quickly of his role in The Ten Commandments as he and a half-brother are rivals for the throne. He pulls off the part quite nicely and the scene in which he judges which of two women is the true mother of a child is well done. The rivalry makes sense, but the involvement of the Pharaoh of Egypt seems contrived and gimmicky. There is suspense building up steadily and it is easy to like Solomon and to sympathize with his dilemma. This Bible movie does not have as much scriptural content upon which to base a plot and therefore has more of a challenge in production than a story of King David or of Samson might have; nevertheless, a believable plot is offered and the work is admirable. On the negative side, I thought the Prophet Nathan was too young and that the beauty of the temple was greatly minimized."
2,"Not a great film, not a great DVD","A big spectacle movie with cartoon-like acting. I wish MGM or whatever corporation did the DVD production had pulled out some more of the Tyrone Power footage (shot before his death 2/3 of the way through filming) and added it to the bonuses. Since the film itself does not have the greatest reputation, I would think that the addition of some cinematic history would really make this DVD more worthwhile. Too bad. If there is more footage other than the bits you can see spliced into the film in long shots (look for puffier hair), it would be great to see it someday."
4,On DVD at last!,SOLOMON AND SHEBA finally gets a U.S. DVD release and the wait was worth it! The movie hasn't looked or sounded this good since the day it was released back in 1959. Gina Lollobrigida at her most beautiful and Yul Brynner with hair...plus a cast of thousands. Who could ask for more? Great entertainment in the DeMille tradition.
1,I'm Bummed,"It wasn't clear that this is a PAL version. I bot it, but can't watch it and I can't get my money back. :-("
4,Classics,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The DVD is great. The color, picture and sound is great. The cast and their clothing is beautifull."
2,Absolutely terrible picture quality.,"None of the Amazon reviewers noted any problems with the picture quality on this DVD version of Solomon And Sheba, so I decided to take a chance. Big mistake. This DVD was made in Taiwan, probably dubbed off a crummy VHS copy in somebody's garage. I ordered this from an Amazon Merchant. I won't do that again. Some of these ""Merchants"" have no idea what they are selling. Some internet DVD review sites gave this movie a favorable review for picture quality so maybe there is more than version available, but don't order this DVD from Amazon."
2,I long to see the original footage.......,"I have watched this film three times hoping to get a glimpse of Tyrone Power --- just a glimpse would have sparked it up a bit. In my opinion, had Power been able to finish filming it would have been a true epic. But...it was not meant to be so we are left with a mediocre film. I would think that after 50 plus years, the original footage could be released as a documentary. I will go on hoping whoever owns it will make it available to the public."
3,Fun and Funny,"This movie has very little historical value to it. It loosely based on the Bible and that you have to remember.Yul Brynner plays Solomon and Gina Lollobrigida plays the Queen of Sheba, who's never directly given a name. She starts out trying to destroy Solomon, but ends up falling in love with him.The sets are outlandish, the dialogue is too. The acting which is OK seems completely, and is, out of date. But for all of that it's still a watchable movie. The ending could have used a little work though, as could the action scenes, but still a watchable movie."
1,Spongebob going downhill...,"These are possibly the worst spongebob episodes ever. The Vikings and Ditchin' are currently my least favorite episodes in the whole series and I am a huge spongebob fan. Please, don't buy this."
4,Sounding just like they should,"Another in an excellent series of concertos and chamber works by Telemann, melodic inventor extraodinaire. Performances on period instruments are smooth and perhaps a bit more laid back than the average period ensemble, kind of steady-as-she-goes. Certainly very fine players. Recordings are on the warm side but detail is good. And for what it's worth CDs are gold."
1,Forget this One,"When I received my copy it wouldn't play in the DVD player saying ""This video cannot be played outside the United States"". I returned it but have yet to receive credit for it. It may be just as well because after I ordered it I read some reviews which trashed it saying it was just the usual Hollywood garbage replete with irrelevant love storieslWhat is the advantage of buying things through Amazon ?"
4,Return,I received the movie in PAL format and could noty play it so I rented it from nexflix. I like flying movies this one is one of the greatest.
3,Mosquito fans,Bought this for the aircraft not the acting although in all fairness was the problem the actors or the script?
2,Disappointing 70s world war 2 flick.,Bad special effects as far as the model work goes. Stupid love story that you have to fast forward through. 60s hairdos on what are supposed to be 1940s women. It's just low budget and lame.
3,I Need To Learn To Read The Reviews First!,"I bought this on the fly (no pun intended)at a local store, then watched it , then ran to Amazon.com to read the reviews. Yup, it's all been said before. This is a clone of 633 Squadron, even down to the plane crash and the hook-handed pilot.The two-pilots-love-same-woman reminded me of Pearl Harbor.Still, some good acting and good flying footage. Worth a view if you can buy it cheap."
2,Mediocre Mosquito,"I loved 633 Squadron so much I decided to give this movie a shot. You can imagine my disappointment when I saw many of the same flying scenes borrowed from 633 squadron. I am a fan of David McCallum but this movie has trouble redeeming itself amongst good war movies.It is a decent movie but if you are an avid fan of movies like 633 Squadron, Battle of Britain, and Memphis Belle, you probably will be disappointed. I'm afraid after one viewing I donated my DVD to the library.The DVD quality is good and picture and sound quality are solid. I just wish that MGM had not tried to make the original movie so cheaply and borrowed so much from 633 Squadron and they had added some more well known actors and actresses to make it stand out."
2,Terrible movie,"Being a huge fan of the De Havilland Mosquito, when I saw this on Netflix, I immediately ordered it. I mean, Mossies, and Ilya Kuryakin(David McCallum)? Gotta do it.One of the opening scenes portrayed ""London"", but as a V-1 Doodle Bug flying bomb nears the end of its flight, there's a nuclear cooling tower....and the movie didn't improve. Surprisingly, the romance aspect of the film was one of the highlights....not a good sign. At least the makers of this film had the sense to borrow copious footage from the far superior ""633 Squadron"".By the way, when in England, be sure to visit the De Havilland Museum at Lincoln Colney, just outside St. Albans, Herts. It's well worth the visit."
3,Mosquitoes revisited,"Mosquito Squadron is a take-off on the 633 Squadron film. After viewing the movie, many sequences were taken from 633. The same landing pattern segment was used and the same crash landing and firefighting sequence. The saving grace was a better storyline and better acting. However, Sixties special effects were still inadequate. George Lucas has spoiled us or at least me. Again, my motivation in purchasing this DVD was to see the flying abilities of the De Havilland Mosquito in low altitude attack mode. This aircraft was famous for it."
3,An okay RAF movie WWII ...,"This is an entertaining story, but at times a little confused...Few of the flying sequences are new but any flying sequence involving the Mosquito are never boring."
5,Excellent mouthpiece.,"This mouthpiece is remarkable. I recently reintroduced myself to trumpeting with this mouthpiece, as well as a few others. Between the 7c, the 5c, and this 5x, the 5x is undoubtedly my most favored. I have no issues projecting the lower register with this piece, unlike reports I have heard elsewhere to the contrary. And furthermore, it brings the upper register with exceptional ease. Being gold-plated it is alleged to have a darker sound. I haven't noticed this precisely, but I have noticed a sound 'purity' difference between my other mouthpieces. It is smooth, and very easy to handle/manipulate to my aim.I was lucky enough to purchase this around 1 o'clock a.m. on a Friday morning through Amazon, and at this particular time, it seems that they greatly lowered the price of the item. Which means I paid about $100 less than it's original retail value. Best deal on this Gold Plated mouthpiece PERIOD."
2,Terrible blades,"As with most of Delta's band saw blades - these are terrible. They do not track well and dull easily. If you are a cheapskate like I am and don't want to spend more money for several blades, then give up and buy one premium blade such as a ""Timber Wolf"" instead. You'll be glad you did. They track extremely well on much lower tension settings. You won't believe the positive difference they make."
1,"The ""politically correct"" Mediterranean Diet","Underlying the book is a strong current of political correctness. For example, it talks about buying locally, (page 22), which is fine but says that buying New York state apples and shipping them to California ""...causes unnecessary pollution due to the fossil fuel emission..."". What does that have to do with the Mediterranean Diet? If you live in the Northeast, the season for apples is very short as is the season for many others fruits and vegetable. Produce from California and Florida provide us with a nutritious and varied diet. Using a book about diet to argue against fossil fuel emissions dramatically reduces the effectiveness of the book."
2,Everything Mediterranean Cookbook,I wish the marketing had been clearer that this is mainly a diet book. The inclusion of such recipes as the one for steamed broccoli was so disappointing. I have a repertoire of stocks that goes far beyond what this book offers and am used to having them on hand all the time. I am a fairly accomplished cook and was looking to branch into traditional Mediterranean cuisine which I have never tried before. This book does not take you there. It's going to the library sale.
4,Very good book,"Yes, these recipes take time because you have to do some homemade stock, but that is why they taste so much better. I am a Chef and I write recipes and have written several cookbooks myself. I can tell you this book and recipes are very good and a much healthier way about cooking. I already make my own stock and sauces, because it is much healthier (taste better) then buying store bought high sodium and full of MSG stocks and sauces. I have learned in Italy how to cook Italian food and this book is pretty close to the real thing. If you love to cook and want to make healthy dinners for your family then I recommend this book. If you are wanting a quick meal then this is not the book for you, although they do have some quick recipes too. Mediterranean cooking is all about Fresh, Fresh, Fresh Ingredients and that is why it taste so good.Enjoy Life and Happy Cooking,Chef LindaThe Art of Cuisine"
4,Need $$ to be on this diet,This diet is really great! However the only down fall I found is that it is very costly. Eating fresh and organic is most certainly way to go but we were spending way too much on food to be on this diet. Recipes are wonderful and you feel really good after you eat a lot of these foods for awhile. This diet is not for someone on a budget.
5,Great Diego DVD,"I bought this DVD because my son loves Diego. I bought this DVD without knowing what was on it, so here is a list of the specific episodes it has. I don't recall seeing many of these on tv, so they must be new episodes;- Welcome home lion cub- Diego's Ringed Seal Rescue- Diego reunites hippopotamus & oxpecker- Diego's orangutan rescueEnjoy!"
3,not for the experienced,"simplistic, for beginnersI didnt realize that when I ordered it and will be passing the book on to my neighbor who wants to get a horse and has no experience with them."
4,horse book,This is a very useful book for a beginning horse owner or a person evaluating the idea of horse ownership.
5,"compelling , disturbing, and unforgetable","I read this book in a single all day sitting. Only once before have I been so engrossed. It was a kidless Saturday and this book took ahold of me immediately. The characters seemed so human, so frail and yet amazinly potent. As the mother of sons it stirred up emotion in such a way that although it seemed my heart would break I couldn't put it down. Card knows good and evil in a way I just can't explain. I've now read his Ender series and am quite a fan of his Alvin Maker series but this book will leave you contemplating life for a good while after you close the book."
3,A different book,"I enjoyed this book. It held my attention because of the details of the family and the Mormon religion. However, I found myself waiting and waiting for the story of the lost children and how Stevie was involved. I felt a bond to the characters in the story but was impatient for the rest. The ending was very surprising and not at all what I expected. This is the first book of Orson Scott Card's I have ever read and I found it different and interesting."
2,Should have left it as a short story,"It is quite obvious that this was originally a short story. It should have stayed one. Instead, Card added 400 pages of side stories that never tied into the main plot line. Read the last 50 pages and skip the rest. I understand that there are many people who praised this book and I can only assume that they share Card's faith and enjoyed the detailed description of life as a Mormon. But if you pick up the book, read the synopsis on the back and buy it based on that you'll be fooled as 90% of the pages are unrelated to the ""main"" story. I kept getting angry as the story went no where until the last few pages. Skip it."
2,Waste of Time,"So I really liked this book up until the last few pages. I loved the family dynamic and the story of the father's crap job and their son's imaginary friends. What I didn't like is how most of this book is a mystery type book only 20 pages of this book is sci-fi, and even sci-fi is questionable. I guess I don't want to ruin it for anyone reading this who hasn't read it yet, but I got to the ending and just thought, are you kidding me. You have such a great story buildup and the thing with the list and it's connections and this is how he ends it? Did OSC just need to finish the book quickly so he could make some dough? There could have been so much more to the ending which was abrupt and lame. I wanted something good after reading 500 or so pages and all I got was disappointment.If you want a good OSC book go read Ender's Game."
2,***Yawn***,"Two stars may be unfair, as I did not finish the book. But two stars may be more than fair because I COULDN'T finish the book. I'm a fan of Orson Scott Card and Ender's Game remains one of my all-time favorites. But this one never took off. Quite frankly I just got bored. I understand writing about the common man, but these people were just too common, dull, vanilla, Mormon, whatever. I'll read scenes about mundane activity all day long if the writer gives me something to latch onto, but there was nothing here. I gave it about 80 pages, which is more than I normally give a boring read. It may have turned out to be a fine story (Mr. Card is an old pro) but I have too many books beckoning from my shelves. Best of luck with this one, I hope you all fare better."
1,"Card's Folley: ""The Lost Boys"" should have remained lost...","A constant loving fan of OS Card's work, I was disgusted at this work. This piece feels like his first attempt in high school at a manuscript. This would be the one he threw away, not the one he turned in. It concerns a family which has moved to a new place; Father has a new job, son starts acting strange, playing with kids who arent there, Children start turning up missing, etc. Card tries to twist and turn the plot to point at different characters: a overly strict school teacher, a strange neighborhood boy with a twisted sense of religion, etc, but these plots are cheap and not well thought out; I was almost insulted and kept returning to look at the cover to make sure the author was not some one else. The ending was the best, but only because it was the ending. I rated the book a '2', only because I saw the original manuscript to ""Plan 9 from outer space"". It got the '1'. - Bob Meads"
5,A great book for a parent,I understand reviews that scored this book low. It is a boring book for a non-involved person. Only a parent or a truly sensitive person can be involved enough to appreciate this book. I recommend this book.
1,"Though the writing was good, I found this novel disturbing","This novel should not be available for children or teenagers to read. It tells of things children should not know about as well as producing images children would find horrifying. Of the OSC books I have read, this was the most disturbing."
2,Borring and weird,"It seems like Orson are not quite sure how he want to write this book - a little suspense in the beginning and the end. You think something will happen most of the time, but all you get is a teaching about how the mormons live and how their community works.After 14 hours of the family getting into all kind of weird situations (for a very loving family to get so many enymies is just weird) you finally have about 45 minutes of ""terror/suspense"". But that is mostly because you can't wait for the book to finally get to the end.If he had come to this end after 6 hours it would have been better..."
4,Slow Start But Powerful Finish,"I finished reading this book two days ago and I still can't stop thinking about it. I, like other reviewers, kept wondering when things were going to get moving in the beginning of the novel. Card could have knocked off some pages here or not made things so mundane. However, I'm glad I stuck it out. The ending was THE BEST. Tears were streaming down my cheeks, and I don't cry easily when I read. I don't think that I will EVER forget this book. This is the only review I have ever written here for any book, because no book has ever had this much of an effect on me. And I am ALWAYS reading."
2,Over-toots the horn of Mormonism,"This book isn't poorly written or anything, but it's not at all comparable to the Ender's Game series or the other Orson Scott Card I am familiar with. I certainly wouldn't call it an ""absorbing thriller"". The indications of creepy/supernatural content given by the cover art, title, and plot synopses are all misleading. The whole story of the 'lost boys' is just background material, just a vehicle for a story which is really about a Mormon family trying to be good people... which is kind of interesting, I mean, you don't read too many books where the main characters are Mormons. Card, though, he really hits you over the head with the religious values stuff. And anyway, I felt kind of wronged, as I was expecting both a ghost story and something at least HALF as exciting as Ender's Game and its progeny.For a better book about both family AND supernatural stuff, I recommend ""Firestarter"" by Stephen King."
5,"Amazing, simply amazing!!!!","I don't read often, I've never heard of Orson Scott Card, but I absolutely LOVE this book and will recommend it to everyone, and I just WISH that it would be made into a movie. This would totally put Sixth Sense to shame! I do admit it was a little drawn out at first, but once it started going, I couldn't put it down. I think that the twist at the end was amazing and I never saw that coming. Great book! And if you don't cry, then you don't have a heart!"
4,A good book that needs some patience,"This is a good book, but many people didnt like it because it wasnt focused. When you buy this book, dont expect it to be exactly like the summaries, it mainly is a family tale. But it is a good book and I reccomend it."
4,"An excellent, but sad story. Intersting sidelights...","Although I loved the writing and was completely entranced throughout the entire book, it was too sad at the end to rate a 10. Being a PC buff, I was delighted to hear his description of the early days of PC programming, even though that part was relatively minor."
2,*sigh,"I read Lost Boys while on my break from college. I had heard marvelous things about it, and being a big fan of Orson Scott Card, I had high expectations. I found that the book was about 300 pages too long with many useless details. In fact, there were entire chapters dedicated to these useless details. The plotline was dragged out so thinly that there were times when I would forget that there even was a plot. In fact, the tension didn't even begin to build up until the second to last chapter. I must say, I thought Enchantment to be a masterpiece while Lost Boys did not satisfy me."
2,Don't buy the audio tape version....,"I just picked up an audio tape version of this book in a bargain bin, and was held as its prisoner during a long drive. I don't have any doubt that Card spun a good tale in the book version, but if there were some holes left in the print version (as another reviewer pointed out) they came across as craters on tape. Unlike the print version, which I believe may have carried the subplots more effectively, I revealed the end of the book (out loud) to any empty car a good hour before it ended... the tape version was that transparent. It wasn't the worst way to spend 3 hours, but I have to think I may have cheated myself out of a good book by taking it in this way."
3,Mixed feelings,"First of all, I must admit, the pages were turning. So that's a plus. But occasionally, even often, I found myself gaping in disbelief at the reactions of the characters to events happening around them. The newspaper comes and shows pictures and names of 7 boys who have been murdered and (get ready...or, if you haven't read the book yet, tune out) they match those that the 8-year-old semi-protagonist has invented as playmates: this is slightly shocking news for a parent to digest. Yet they barely react. Just as they barely react to the same son's death. I don't know, this book troubled me and not in the probing way that thoughtful novels do. Maybe with more thought I'll see what Card was trying to do. I couldn't tell if it was a thriller, a chiller, or an allegory."
3,"Good narration, bad plot...","Its hard to give this book either a good or bad review... Card's writing technique is, as usual, outstanding. He is an author that is very easy to read. However, there is one question to be brought up... what is the point of this book? To say that ghosts exist? To show what Mormonism is about? to show what faults people may have? (i.e. obsessive, stalking teacher, mean classmates, A pedophiliac teenage programmer, a misguided mormon zealot, etc...)I mean, whe I was done with the book, I was like, ""Is that IT?""Well, I give it a ""10"" for Card's awesome style of narration... a ""1"" for the material of the story...P.S.: The movie ""Lost Boys"" (the vampire flic) is just as pointless... :-) If you like the book anyway, DON'T rent it or watch it on TV. They are totally different stories..."
2,Not up to his standard,"Orson Scott Card has written some enthralling novels and some very interesting short stories. He should not try to combine the two, apparently. This novel, originally a short story but now a commercial for Card's religion, just seems to scream for an editor with a shard red pencil. The father's trials with his job might have been interesting if they had anything to do with the story. Otherwise, the meat of the story seemed to fall in the last few pages. If I wanted to read a novel-length advertisement for the Mormon religion, I suppose this might be an interesting way to go about it. Very disappointing."
1,Aaargh! The ending!!,"No spoiler, just this:I read the whole, dragging book, only to choke on the ending. Not much else I can say without giving away the ending, but after it was over, I thought, ""I really hate this book."""
5,one of my favorite books!,"This was orson scott card's first book i read by him and i think his best. this book has everything suspense, horror, romance, and even a little comedy.Its about a new family with several children that moves into a small town. one of the younger sons tells hisparents about his friends who they think are imaginative. but the story is much more then that. i dont want to give anything away. all i have to say is i am a horror book fan and i loved this book. and this is the only book that has made me choked up and teary at the end.i have recommended this book to my friends and family and evry person who has read it has loved it! do yourself a favor and read this book. you wont regret it. my only question is why hasnt this been made into a movie yet?"
1,Nice ending doesn't make up for boring book,"This could have been a good book, but it's too boring. Secondary characters exist only as weak suspects for the killer. The Mormon angle had nothing to do with the plot. The main plot is hardly mentioned in the first 450 pages. It's all fluff and drivel. The end is nice, but Card should have concentrated on the main story and cut the extra stuff."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I am a major Orson Scott Card fan, having read or listened to about ten of this books. This was by far the worst. While the end was certainly intriquing, the journey to get there was not worth it. I had no interest in the family or their struggles, and it seemed irrelevant to the book's climax. Plus, the blatant ""commercial"" for Mormonism was pretty self-serving. Don't waste your time."
1,Unbelievably bad,"If you're thinking about reading this book because you love Orson Scott Card's science fiction stories you can stop right now. The other-worldly computer game is a very, very minor part of the book. If you're thinking about reading this book because you love the moral and idealogical dilemmas Orson Scott Card weaves into his novels, you can stop right now. There are no ambiguities to contemplate here: the Fletchers are good and practically everyone else is evil. I can't believe the same person who wrote this also wrote ""Pastwatch""."
2,Expect to be Disappointed,"This book starts off at a fast pace and after the first couple of chapters you will be hooked. It is about a family who moves to NC (so that the father may work for a small software company) and the stress and changes that affect all of them. Card sets a creepy tone for the book from the beginning and this is further enhanced by the environments he creates for Step at work, DeAnne at home, and Stevie at school. But it seems that Card either didn't know where the book was going or got tired of writing it, because the last 50 pages bring the story to an abrupt end and do nothing to address many of the sub-plots in the book. If you are fan of Card's you will buy this book despite a bad review, but when you are finished, don't say you weren't warned that you would be disappointed."
4,Benson is a Beast.,"This audio book version of Card's novel has two main flaws:First, it was not condensed by Card. It couldn't have been, because it mixed up some information, especially about Mormon doctrine (the main character, Step Fletcher, is Mormon).Also the narrator, Robby Benson, (known as the voice of the beast in the Disney movie) reads everything with dramatic whispers, neccesarry or not, and it's annoying.It's a wonderful story, though, and if you're not going to read the book, don't pass up the audio version."
2,Too dark for a Card's book,"I read this book looking for the light-hearted prose of Orson Scott Card, like in ""Songmaster"" or ""Ender's game"", and it is not at all like those books. The story is too terrible, too dark. This book left me a sour-sweet feeling that I didn't like at all."
2,"Well written, but no story to be found","This was a tough book to review. For 4/5 of the book, NOTHING HAPPENS. Yet it is so well-written, that I wanted to keep reading to find out how the characters deal with things. Primarily, the father (Skip) gets a job at a computer programming company and is surrounded by jerks. You want to see how he deals with them and gets by. Secondarily is young Stephen, who is shy and relies on imaginary friends. He is supposed to be the crux of the tale, but he is basically treated as an afterthought. Third is the Mormon religion. There is a LOT of info about how Mormons handle religion, how they deal with each other, etc. Kind of hits you over the head.Only until the end does the book really get into the horror genre, but by then it's too late for me to recommend this book to anyone other than hardcore fans of Orson Scott Card."
1,card's worst,"First off, Card is my favorite author period.I read an essay of his where he states that Lost Boys is his best work. Sorry, but I couldn't even finish it...it bored me to tears. He should have left well enough alone with the short story (which was absolutely perfect)."
2,Another sad Card tale is empty at heart,"Yes, the book is harrowingly sad, the ultimate fate of the characters utterly heart-breaking, the portrait of their lives drawn with poignant care. But the book is meaningless. I fail to understand the point of a story whose sole intent is to relay a message of bottomless sorrow. And there are other, darker implications beneath the text that speak of Card's ongoing exploration of certain aspects of human behaviour, making me feel very much lectured at. But the book is highly readable, and the history lesson about the early days of computer software is very engaging. It'd rate higher with me if it weren't for the fact that it seems to have been written with the single-minded purpose of manipulating readers into feeling heartbreak and sorrow. I'm even supposed to boo at the obvious villains"
3,depends what you want,"If you are looking for a quality universal remote to command your entire electronic empire, keep looking and expect to pay more money. This remote has a tiny table with multiple codes within each brand that take forever to go through. It wasn't made for DVD players and so while theoretically it can be used for it, I doubt it would function well.If however you want a remote to replace your TV remote, or use with your VCR and that's it, then it functions adequately. I just got it to replace the one on my old TV, and it does well enough."
1,Doesn't work with my tv.,"I checked the manual, only two codes, and both don't work. I tried the other ways to connect, still doesn't work."
3,Not bad...,"Not bad, can't beat the price. Took a sec to set up my surround sound. I couldn't set it up for the new LCD tv but I do have a remote for that so it wasn't bought for that reason. Looks and feels like it was bought from the dollar store."
1,did not work,"I followed the instructions to a T, and could not get it to work - was supposed to be a match to my particular make/model TV"
1,"Cheap, awful earrings and hideous customer service!","The earrings are dollar-bin quality, and one of them had a big black fleck in it. Despite the fact that this was their fault, Sabrina Silver did not refund the cost of returning the earrings to them (they did refund the purchase price and original shipping.) Now they have increased the price from $8.95 to $17.95? Ridiculous. Save your time and money."
5,Present for mom,I LOVE these earrings. They are really pretty and go with several outfits. They are so delicate and elegant looking!
1,It's just fiction,"Trying to justify a work of fiction by writing another book to try to prove it's true - doesn't make it true. There is a reason there are respected Christian theologians writing books that explain how the Left Behind series doesn't parallel what is in the Bible. The Bible is true, Left Behind is fiction."
4,Someone should sing these on American Idol!!,"Look, I'm a guy and I think David Cassidy is COOL! I know, I know. I can't stand ""today's"" music. Can you? If anyone on American Idol sang these songs, they would win regardless of how talented they are.Blind Hope, Could it Be Forever, I Lost My Chance are great songs."
3,"Well, it was OK","This book had its good points, but wasn't the environmental/evolution disaster novel I quite expected. I don't think I'll ruin anything by saying that the book is basically about a huge bug picking off Navy SEALs one by one. Yep, a big bug. Lots of bug descriptions if your into that sort of thing.Cool thing about this book is that ANYBODY CAN DIE AT ANYTIME! Very few books do that. You get attached to these people and then chomp, chomp, chomp. It's great.Overall, a pretty good book to turn your brain off and enjoy, but not a real edge of your seat kind of thriller."
3,Think Alien crossed with Predator,"If you purchase this book consider if you will the original movie Alien with a few premises from the movie Predator included.We have a strong protagonist lead in Cameron who is married to Justin. (All while reading the book I pictured Cameron Diaz and Justin Timerlake but they couldn't make the book happen.)You can read from the content the other reviews. It was an enjoyable book, but I kept waiting for the book to get to the conclusion and find out who made it out alive.The book could easily be made into a movie."
3,MINUTES TO BURN HAD TOO MUCH TIME!,"The beginning of this novel was the best since it introduced an assortment of interesting characters, but after that, it seemed to bog down and bore me.Now, ususally I love these types of books and movies, but after about 100 pages, I found myself losing interest due to lack of movement and great action sequences.This is where the book fell flat for me. If you could combine this authors ideas and add some great action-type writing such as Matthew Reilly, then you would have a blockbuster on your hands. These two writers need to meet and collaborate!"
1,Not accurate depiction of product in photos.,"The pictures for this item are misleading! I looked and looked to find auto bingo for my family of 4 and was very happy with this product, however, when it arrived there were only 3 bingo cards in the case. Both pictures posted on Amazon show 4 cards each so this was upsetting. The pictures on amazon are just like the picture on the product itself except someone added an additional card on the Amazon pictures...please change the pictures to accurately depict this item."
2,travel bingo,"This was way too hard. You have to continuously look out of the window for people ,places,or things. Some of the bingo spaces were for things you are NEVER going to see out of the window! My 6 year old and 9 year old gave up after 15 minutes. Poorly designed."
1,Do yourselves a favour....,"... and read the book. I think those of us who have experienced the rich dialogue, wonderful descriptions and the complete story will probably agree that the film falls short of a decent portrayal of the book. Not that the film was terrible, but such a disappointment after the power and feeling in the novel itself.The book on tape version incidentally is most excellent!"
1,"Dazzling, Beautiful, Believable??? I think not!!!","Dazzling, Beautiful, Believable??? I think not!!! I found this film to be boring, slow, and painful to watch. I picked it up thinking it would be a great Sunday afternoon flick. Boy was I wrong!!! Nicholas Cage as an Italian soldier??? Please!!! It is an insult to those of us who are indeed of Italian heritage to see such an actor portray this role. His performance was not believable nor was his dialect. Cage could and should have been better prepared for this role. As for Penelope Cruz, I think having been supported by a lead actor who was more suited for this role would have made this a phenomenal picture. Overall, I was bored with this picture and would not recommend to anyone. It's definetly a sleeper."
1,Don't Plan to watch this on your computer...,"Unless you download their anti-theft software. This software also gets info from your computer (spy bots) and sends it to heaven knows where. You cannot watch the DVD on your computer unless you agree to load the software. I resent that I have to load spy software to watch a movie. This is a Universal Studios DVD. If all of them start doing this, and they may, my computer would be full of otherwise useless software. Also, there is no notice on the cover telling you this, so you aren't given the option not to buy."
1,how to make a terrible film from a great book,"on the plus side, the book of captain corellis madolin was a very original and enchanting book. it would have been possible to make many good screenplays from the material, unfortunately, the film is very very weak.Cage in possibly his worst role, seems to be hamming it up with a terrible comedy accent, and just doesnt seem beleivable with the not terribly talented Cruz, one would guess she only gets jobs as there is some misconception she will pull in a male audience, an appeal lost on me through her terrible acting.the scenery is nice.John Hurt is competent but he just cant save this disastor.The chnages in the plot to make the film more PC and not offend anyone, diluted the story to a pathetically weak love story between the two weakest players.please do not put Cruz and Cage in another movie together.Actually theres so many flaws im gonna cut this short, but just to mention that the action scenes in the A-tema were more credible."
1,Couldn't view the movie,Received the DVD and got about 20 minutes into the movie and the DVD stopped working; had to send it back to Amazon for a refund.
1,This movie could not be worse if it had zombies in it.,"Mama Mia I no hear-a such a bad-a Italian movie accent since da original 1932 Scar Face. Nicholas Cage accent is-a so bad I almost-a pee myself laughing.Dis a movie a really really suck.Dis a movie coulda not be worse if it had zombies in it.Dis a movie is a subtle like a Al Capone with a base-a-ball bat.Dis a movie so bad I surprised that a director no call a Jack Kevorkian before it was a released.Dis a movie so bad it maybe have entertainment value as da worst movie ever made.I feel-a sorry for the other actors that have-a to listen to a Cage with-a straight-a face-a.Now that a acting!Too bad-a that Gilda Radner is-a dead, her Rossana Rosana Dana character could-a played Penelope Cruz's part and a give-a balance to Cage."
2,could have been a good movie with a different set of actors,"I can't stand either Nicolas Cage or Penelope Cruz so I was prepared to hate it. It wasn't as bad as I anticipated but it wasn't great either. Nicolas Cage is a terrible actor and his fake Italian accent was getting on my nerves in a major way. All the Italians in the movie joke around and sing-that all they do. I also couldn't see how they(N and P) fell in love. One day they just were. Yeah, right. I have to add one more thing and its about Penelope's looks. I think with right clothes and makeup she can look decent but in this movie she looks downright horrid. Her hair is done in the most unflattering hairdo on the planet and her clothes look as if she robbed the scarecrow. Whether the look was intentional or accidental is a mystery. The ending was incredibly stupid. He leaves Penelope until the war is over and then doesn't come back until two years later because he feels guilty about coming between her and her fiancé. Give me a break"
2,Not at ALL as expected!,"Having seen the previews for this film, I expected a romance set against the backdrop of WWII on a beautiful island. NOT! It is a romance, and the island is beautiful, but this is first and foremost a war movie, and a brutal one at that. This movie is not for the faint of heart.Aside from that, this movie still doesn't have much going for it besides the beautiful scenery. I am a Nicholas Cage fan, but this is definitely not his best work. The accent is inconsistent and poorly done, and Cage himself doesn't seem to feel comfortable in this role.Did I mention this movie is brutal?I won't be watching it again."
1,No wonder the Italians lost the war....,"OK..I am not a Nicholas Cage fan(8mm was good in it own disturbing way..)but other than that I think the man is WAY overrated. this movie is just another testamonial of how bad his acting is. He is not a fluid actor, everything he does seems forced. A Singing Artillery Battery? No wonder the Italians lost the war......One of the best parts of the whole movie was the actual surrender of the village...to the Germans.(Oh, and the singing arty men facing the German firing squad.)Penelope Cruz was very good...too bad she had to play opposite Cage."
1,Waste of time,"I stopped it half way thru - why waste yet more time. Was told the book is excellent - haven't read it. I'm male and not a prude at all, but the sex scene with Cage taking off her clothes made my skin crawl."
2,Waste of time,"This film was crap! if penelope cruz wasn't in it i would have walked out of the cinema ages ago. There was absolutely NO chemistry between the lead characters. and Nicholas Cage's acting was HORRIBLE! he couldn't put up an accent if his life depended on it! The only amazing thing about the film was the scenery and the music.. Loved ""Pelagia's Song""."
4,VERY GOOD,"this movie wants me want to cry because it is about the universal theme.. love.I love penelope cruz and I think she's like the best actress to come out of europe since liv ullmann.Speaking of which, this movie remind me of bergman, the music and the close-shots.I just want to cry.buy the DVD when it comes out.you'll want to cry too."
1,This Chick-Flck ...,"First, this is a definite chick flick. Second, this film ... rocks. Cage's corny accent is somewhere between an Italian with Down's Syndrome and Marlee Matlin doing an Italian accent. The film drags, has non-interesting characters, and is corny. The only thing that could hold a guy's interests is Cruz... and she has hairy pits... this movie is the pits!"
2,Great Scenery and Nothing More,"Somewhat of a mixed bag, this lush but lopsided film adaptation of Louis de Bernieres' 1994 wartime novel is best observed for its breathtaking views of Cephalonia (I'd fly there tomorrow if I could). That plus Christian Bale's convincing portrayal of a jilted Greek fisherman (his Greek accent is perfect) make this overlong film somwwhat bearable.On the downside, you get Penelope Crus completely miscast and wooden as a dewey-eyed Greek woman who falls in love with an Italian soldier played by Nicolas Cage. O.K., Cage tries to redeem himself. But his Italian accent is as phoney as the screenplay. In short, laughs comes in all the wrong places, especially when Cruz and Cage try to act sexy. UGH!"
3,Nicolas Cage was a poor choice,"This could have been a very good movie, but casting Nicolas Cage as an Italian officer was a very poor choice. Penelope Cruz was good, and John Hurt, as usual, did an excellent job, perhaps because he didn't work so hard at his accent.However, Nicolas Cage's Captain Corelli was more of a caricature than a three-dimensional character. Nothing fit--not his mannerisms, not his accent, and especially not his singing voice. Consequently I had trouble taking the whole thing seriously.It's unfortunate that American films can't rake in the big bucks unless they have a big name star. This film would have benefited immensely had they used a real Italian actor in the main roll."
3,Captain's Corelli Mandolin,"The item delivered by Amazon is very fine. The film is a bit of a ""soft drink"" with respect to the reality.Captain Corelli was still alive a couple of years ago, he was in Florence (Tuscany). I guess he was wondering around with a mandolin on his shoulders (especially along military parades). In that event, about 8500-9500 Italian troops were executed by Germans/Nazis because they refused to surrend, and in the end they run out of ammonitions.If I remember rigth, officers (many were young guys) were shoot one by one. This is remembered as the ""Massacre of Cephalonia"". I wish that such a tragedy would have been represented by a more highly profiled film."
4,Mascara?,"This is supposed to be a conditioner but you can definately wear it instead of mascara. I have used it both ways and it works well either way. It does tint your lashes so they aren't ""fake"" colored. I would buy again."
4,Nice lightweight mascara,"I'm not a big fan of most mascaras available, but the Natural Lash Builder Tint and Conditioner is a really good product for those women who want their lashes to look dark and natural. There is absolutely no clumping or build-up with this product. I haven't noticed any smudging and no irritation. So glad I went on Amazon and found a product that's exactly what I wanted for my lashes."
4,Natural Looking dark lashes,"I like this lash tint because it makes my lashes that are blond on the tips look longer and darker without looking like I'm wearing mascara. There's no clumping and it doesn't flake or smudge off (a problem I have with regular mascara, even the ones that say they don't flake or smudge.) The tint lasts a long time, I often find my lashes still look dark the next morning, but it washes off easily enough. It also seems to make my lashes curl slightly. The only problem I have found, it takes a little longer to dry. One other note the mascara tube is not as pictured, but does seem to be the same product."
2,Average coverage and Odd smell,"This mascara provided average coverage on my lashes that was neither lengthening nor volume enhancing. The smell of the product was off and slightly unpleasant. I doubt I will buy this product again, and may be hesitant to buy this Lamas brand again."
3,not worth the money,"This book is only for people who are really bored and need something to do. Most of it is really stupid. The Beavis and Buttheads"" Chicken Soup for the Butt"" was much better!"
5,The Encyclopedia of Colored Pencil Techniques,"Excellent, excellent, excellent Judy Martin. This book is a great help to beginning art students, for architects, and retired professionals who take up art seriously. It gives you not only an overall view on the many techniques in drawing, but you develop a feeling for each technique. Drawing is easy at different levels, but expressions of feelings in drawings are the challenges in art. Thankyou."
3,Just O.K.,"This didn't have as many photos in it as I'd hoped for, however, it does have some great tips in it!!"
2,Funk Brothers CD,I was disappointed on this one. Not enough of their great hits on here. Loved the video/movie of these amazing musicians - wish the CD did them justice!
2,Disappointed First Time Buyer of the Funk Brothers,After seeing the show (Standing in the Shadows of Motown) on television here in Australia and realising how little I knew of the Funk Brothers I bought the DVD of the show immediately. I also bought some CD's and this collection (the Millennium Collection) does not represent them well (in my very humble opinion). Great musicians they may well be but the songs are lifeless without lyrics. That some of the tunes are listed on the cover as Instrumental lends lie to the fact that they are all (with the exception of a couple of the songs that have some minimum vocal inclusion) instrumental.This is NOT a CD I would recommend to anyone buying the Funk Brothers for the first time unless it was someone who loved groovy organ playing (and I do NOT!). As for the collection that features renowned artists singing the songs; go for it. The DVD is still well worth getting but this CD can stay on the rack.
2,OK but!!!,Not bad CD but it is all instrumental and becomes quite monotonous. Would have been better if some vocals could have been added. This would have made the production more interesting
3,Disappointing,"The background music for some great tunes is okay, but the lack of vocals is a disappointment. We expected a collection of classic hits and were let down by a CD of only instrumentals."
5,impressive scholarship & inspiring historical art,"This is an oversized scholarly volume containing more than 350 black-and-white illustrations, as well as 40 tipped-in color plates. Translated from the German in 1968, the book covers the history of collage before World War II. While its 400+ pages contain serious and comprehensive historical research, it can also inspire modern-day collage artists with its discussions of artistic innovation and the use of art for political commentary. Each art movement warrants its own chapter -- Cubism, Futurism, the German Expressionist period, Russian collage, Dada, Surrealism, and Constructivism and propaganda. Sadly, the author died before the planned second volume covering post-war collage art could be written. Collage-makers will appreciate learning the roots and context of their art and browsing the works of their artistic ancestors."
2,What a piece of crap,I really love Fahey > I have seen him perform on 5 occaisons and have two on tape that I recorded.I have most of all of his albums and the liner notes ... This recording was a piece of crap there are few moments I enjoyed but the dialog was a bore and a complete waste of time... for them to have recorded it and then release it as a finished work is an insult. Listen I like avant garde concepts and have enjoyed dissonces and understood the tongue in cheek pokes at the art community...but this collection is really pretty hard to take The band is actually pretty good in other situations as is Fahey but whatever the dynamics were this did not amuse me Take a pass or buy it cheap if you are a compleatist and need to have it
4,interesting,Not my favorite John Fahey...but I like the experimental aspect of this recording and overall is very good...some of the spoken word parts while the concept is good just doesn't fly...it almost seemed like Fahey was not really into that part and could have been left out.
3,"Useful, uncomplicated manual","I purchased this as a gift for the owner of a new G4 imac. I was looking for a book that would really go through the basics of file and folder management, saving documents, setting preferences etc. I also wanted a book that would be easy to reference from the index and the TOC.The writing is clear and straightforward, and each chapter starts with a thorough explanation of what follows. The book's visuals are screen shots and somewhat small. I found the TOC superior to the index for finding topics. The book is a useful reference for system and application features. It fills the gap between Apple's ""Welcome to Mac OS X"" pamphlet and an advanced technical manual that dives into Applescript, Terminal, Unix, etc.The book is not a beginner's tutorial. However, it is simple enough to answer the questions a novice or intermediate user would have about Apple's new operating system and the applications that are installed on it."
3,Standard General Purpose Blade,"This is a good standard general purpose blade that can be used for almost any type of cutting. The 1/2"" blade can also be used for light-duty resawing, if you don't want to take the time to change to a 3/4"" 3 tooth blade. With 14 tpi, it is suitable for cutting metals.If this is going to be a repeatitive, high volume use blade, and you want accurate precision cuts, I would recommend either the Timberwolf or Lennox bandsaw blades. They seem to be a few grades better when it comes to high usage and precision.Overall, this is a good standard use blade to keep in the bandsaw for various type projects that tend to pop up on the weekends."
5,The cat's mieow--but very far from twee,"My kids love this book: The story is great, the illustrations are funny, and the hero Crispin is simply charming. What else has this great illustrator done??? As an adult (so what do I know), it strikes _me_ as a highly sophisticated book that is directed towards urbane city children--or their parents. I don't think it's coincidental that the book is set in New York City. The characters/plot/tone couldn't ring so true anywhere else... could they?"
5,An inspiring and informative guide to hiking the Winds,"Finis Mitchell is the real thing; a true nature lover who hiked the Wind River Range so many times, that he can actually give you landmark by landmark directions to hikes, fishing and scaling peaks. He has a no-nonsense wisdom paired with a poetic nature. The story of how he stocked many of the lakes with trout is fascinating. Very clear routes to Gannet and Dinwoody Pass."
4,Listen more and you will hear,"I thought this cd was very strange and dark at first,then listened again at low volume while doing my taxes and it just seemed to really work on some deep level somewhere. It's actually quite beautiful and haunting. He never ceases to amaze me."
3,One of the hardest Eno recordings to appreciate.,"I can completely understand the low ratings on this album from some of the respondents. It has taken me a long time to appreciate this one, and I am an Eno fanatic. The first couple of times I listened to it, it made absolutely no impression on me--but like a lot of Eno, its charms come slowly. Still not amongst his best work--I think it may be somewhat hampered by his current fascination with generative music and the Koan product--but it does have some interesting songs, including ""Hazard,"" ""Boomcubist,"" and ""Iced World."" It *is* strangely Casio-like. I would say, ""buy only if you have patience and appreciate Eno's other instrumental recordings."""
2,A VERY SMALL SOUNDING ALBUM,BRIAN ENO PREVIOUS WORKS WITH BANDS LIKE U2 WORKS VERY WELL.IN ENOS ATTEMPT AT THIS ALBUM THERE SEEMS TO BE NO PUNCH.THE SOUNGS START POTENIALY IMPRESSIVE ATMOSHPERIC SOUNDS OF SYNTH PIANO.BUT FAIL TO GROW TO THE STATUS OF GREATNESS.ENO SHOULD STICK TO WORKING WITH BANDS.
1,"Lame, but...""Iced World""!","This album is fantastically, fabulously, ridiculously, BOOORING!!!!!!! The pieces go nowhere, and they all sound like MIDI files, which are ALWAYS awful!! I have listened to this record once, about two years ago. Afterwards I promised myself I would never listen to it again.But here's the audacity: the first 16 pieces on this album are around two or so minutes in length. If the last one, ""Iced World"", was about the same length, this would have been a decently-sized album. But no, ""Iced World"" goes on for HALF AN HOUR!!!!!!!!! Eno puls a supremely weird joke on us all.However, I do have one positive thing to say: This album seems to spark some very interesting, well-written reviews, something that one is sometimes hard pressed to find on amazon. I especially admire the insights of ""Filho"" and the music fan from New Haven, Connecticut. Give these people good votes."
3,odd little ditties,"The Drop was released without any hype whatsoever, and there are no credits(and no booklet either- just some card)on it at all as to who played what- I assume ol' domehead did it all himself. 'The Drop'is a collection of quirky little snippets of instrumentals which often fade in and out, giving the impression to the listener that each track is really minutes, hours, even days longer than presented here- like these short pieces are actually edits of longer cuts, faded in and out to present a soundbite of each. Also, some of the cuts are a bit light, even cute. Could this be Eno's 'cutest' ambient album? Get it and see for yourself. Though not another 'Nerve Net'(when oh when will he do another upbeat technotronic mindblaster like that one again?), the Drop does grow on you, especially at semi-low levels. Great for reading or, as the above reviewer mentioned, doing your taxes and stuff. My one complaint is that the last track drags on a bit too long."
2,Sketches of Nothingness,"Hmmm... perhaps my least favorite Eno album, this one. It almost seems like someone decided to release a series of his sound-sketches for a never-released Talking Heads album. Not much happening, almost like all of Eno's most endearing quirks done by an obsessive yet hopelessly second-rate Eno cover band. A disappointment, but admittedly the only one so far in an otherwise sterling discography."
2,Thud,"Eno noodling on a keyboard. Somewhat aimlessly at that. Agreeable at times. A waste of the listener's musical concentration, though. There simply isn't much here to latch onto - on any level. Maybe in a few years I'll find the obscure genius that may be hiding in this CD. There just doesn't seem to much musical terrain here in which such genius could be hidden."
2,Where did Eno go?,"I am a big Eno fan, collecting most of his Ambient and Eno-rock. I couldn't help but be dissapointed by ""The Drop"". The recordings lack the discipline and layered structure of Eno's earlier Ambient work. Another reviewer put it best by stating that this album seems like Eno simply ""noodling"" at the keyboard. I don't even think it qualifies as thoughtful noodling, but rather a collection of poor a-tonal improvisation that reminds me more of John Cage than it did Brian Eno.I recommend that listeners new to Eno check out his earlier work, such as his collaboration with Harold Budd on ""The Pearl"", any of the ""Ambient 1-4"" series, Eno's excellent collaborations with Hassel, or his ""Music for Films"" series. Any of those examples show Eno as an innovator and disciplined musician.""The Drop"" is at best a improptu sketch of a weak idea. I wish I had not spent the money on this one."
1,A hoax.,"I generally like Eno's work, but this sounds like he wanted to make some quick money from devoted fans. Hey, someone give me a Casio and I'll pull out stuff like this too (actually, I like to think that I can do better than this). A far cry from stuff like ""On Land"". Avoid unless you're a collector who's willing to collect everything."
1,SUCKS!,I just hate it. It looks really bad and has a very rough finish. Not at all looks like what you see in the photos! DON'T BUY!
4,My every day on the go pack.,"I have had this backpack for several years now and overall I have been very happy with it. It began as a simple daypack for short hikes. Since then it has served as a weekend bag, and now more recently it accompanies me into the city each day for my commute to work. It's not perfect, but for the price I think it's a great option for when you're on the go. Side pockets hold 2 Camelbak water bottles comfortably. Lots of loops on the front to hook small carabiners and tools. Straps and support are adequate for a few hours with a full bag. I agree that the zippers are solid but tend to put up a fight when you're looking to close the bag quickly. Space is adequate with a main compartment and smaller front compartment that includes a mesh separator. It has room for an H2O bladder, but I have never used it for that purpose. It's showing no sign of wear and is quite durable."
4,Almost the perfect daypack,"Bought it in August and used it in Nepal for 8 days of hard trekking, as well as my carry-on for the flights there and back. It's very suitable and has ample space for water, a change of clothes and a book or two. During the trek itself I always carried 4 litres of water - two 1 litre Nalgenes in the mesh side pockets and a 2 litre Camelbak bladder inside the pack itself. This pack did everything I wanted it to.So why 4 stars and not 5? Two things. The first is that the shoulder straps would loosen when I jarred them - if I took a sudden step while climbing or descending. Not critical, but annoying. This ties into the second reason. I'm 6'4"" tall and this pack may not be ideal for someone of my height. I couldn't find a good adjustment where the load really rested on my hips and wasn't pulling at my shoulders. We trekked 6-7 hours of hard trekking everyday and it was never a burden, just an annoyance. Outside of the height issue I have no problems recommending this pack."
4,Very comfortable and versitile.,"From the picture and the description, I was expecting a little bit of a bigger pack.It is extremely comfortable, the waist and chest straps see to that well. Do not get me wrongwhen I say i was expecting it to be bigger, its big for a day pack. It would even be okay on longerand over night trips. So far I have used it for everything from hiking, snowboarding and camera hauling.If youre in the market for a reliable and inexpensive pack, go for this one."
4,"Nice sturdy backpack, but terrible space allocation","I got this backpack for my Alaska trip. Its a nice sturdy backpack capable of handling a lot of weight with good support for the back.Its quite roomy too....the only complaint is that it does not have enough compartments. I had jam everything into the same space, which of course made it very difficult for me to separate items easily.Otherwise, its a nice pack for a good price."
4,muy buen producto,excelente mochila la sigo usando aunque cuando la compre la descripcion decia que tenia una estructura interna y en realidad este modelo no lo trae por lo demas la calidad es muy buena aunque desearia que tubiera mas divisiones en las bolsas
3,High Sierra,"Overall Good day pack. This lacked a little extra for me because i also wanted it to serve as a camera bag on hiking trips. It failed there,,,,,but if your looking for a great day pack, this is it"
3,Great product,I never heard of this brand before. I brought this product and are pretty happy with it. But there are not too many pockets to hold all the stuff. There are only one main pocket in the front. If you are a neat freak this is not the product for you.
4,Good all around bag,"I am not a camper or a hiker, but use this bag often for traveling. The web side pouches are great for all types of water bottles. I do find the little accessory pouch on the should strap to be useless for any of the cell phones that my family or I own, but it is good for those little odds and ends. The pine coloring of the bag are a little brighter than in the picture but it is still a nice color. The pack has been stuffed full and still closes well. Overall I am happy with my purchase and would buy this brand again."
3,"Day pack only, possible one night pack","As a day pack this back is great, I also use it for long motorcycle rides to carry a bit of stuff like a change of clothes. My previous 30 litre pack could easily fit my sleeping bag, a solo tent, change of clothes, some food and addition gear, for some reason the design of this pack prevents it form achieving a full 30 litre capacity. I can barely fit my tent and bag in it and get the zipper closed, no room for extras. The straps are perfect and comfortable with the padded waist strap, and the dual water bottle pockets plus hydration bladder ready makes it great for day hiking, but nothing more."
3,Not very interesting,"This book does have useful medical information, but, it really just covers the basics. If you aren't new to Dobermans and get this, get a Doberman book with more in depth info. along with it."
3,getting into the mindset is a slog,will update as I finally get into the book. ordered for inspiration for a narrative visual art project.
3,got smiles,this was a gift to a friend . I have not heard of any problems so I assume it's a good product as she seems happy.
2,Picture is deceiving,The actual item was not as pictured exactly. There was hardly any space between the last bump and the base.
4,Jeo Higgs did write Stepping Razor,"Patrick L. Kelly, Sr. is right about one thing, he has very little knowlege. Joe Higgs is clearly credited with writing Stepping Razor on Peter Tosh's Equal Rights album. Maybe you should check your facts."
4,Gr8 Review!!,"THis is a wonderfull album. Its passionate, soulfull and true. Although this album is short it is fantastic. A MUST HAVE FOR ALL Mr.Loaf fans."
2,Not one of Sowell's best,"I'm a big Sowell fan, but this book is bor-ing. Almost anything by him is much better. Try one of the other Sowell titles."
1,Pompous and unreadable!,"If you like phrases like ""one-way causation"" and ""political super-structure,"" if you want to be impressed with Dr. Sowell's knowledge of Marxism -- and Philosophy and Economics in general -- then by all means buy this book. If you actually want to understand Marxism, then keep looking.To prove that it is possible to write clearly about a complex subject, read Complexity by M. Mitchell Waldrop.Dr. Sowell needs to drop his next six courses in Philosophy and take Basic Writing for Freshman."
5,Watercolor Wow!,"Where else can you listen to Jazz and learn the basics of watercolor? Julie Cohn's CD is an uplifting, easy to learn and follow instructional DVD. In no time, you can learn techniques and apply them and create a beautiful, one-of-a-kind landscape painting. I also found the ""extra"" drawing tips, exercises and quick reference so valueable and helpful. My daughter (age 6) was learning along with me. We really enjoyed the slide show during dinner too! I have been painting watercolor for 10 years and learned more from this DVD and Julie Cohn than I have in any other class I have taken. This DVD is a must own!"
4,"Excellent for Beginners, Good Enough for Pros","A good video, especially as an introduction. I've taught watercolor at Fullerton College for about 16 semesters and even though this is aimed at beginners, I still enjoyed watching it and look forward to watching it again. Julie has some unique approaches that simplify the learning curve. I wish I'd found it years ago. I also wish it had been longer, but what she has on here is well worth the time and money."
5,Nice!,"Julie portrays a quirky, lively patience on screen. Though I am fairy very new to watercolor, I have read numerous books and Web sites about the subject, and this DVD is the first to give much time to doing a color study before you begin your painting, and I found that very useful. Good luck in your studies!"
5,The Dance of Watercolor,"The Dance of Watercolor-Beginners and Beyond by Julie Cohn is excellent. I have completed one semester of Watercolor and was having some problems but after viewing this DVD, my paintings have shown tremendously improvement. The watercolor methods are clearly demonstrated and explained. Also, this DVD explains how to finish off painted areas. I truly benefited from this DVD."
3,Just wasn't impressed.,I watched the first several lessons on this DVD and gave up. She had some basic valuable info but was just a little to 'cutesy' for me. That coupled with her choosing the most expensive brushes on the planet put me off. Just a little bit to boring for me. I switched over to Watercolor Essentials by O'Connor and was much happier.
2,it shows promise,"Test Department's Beating a Retreat is a fair album. The first three tracks are good, especially ""Fall From Light."" I also think ""Cold Witness"" is a good track; it is the least musical one out of the nine. The latter two tracks (""Compulsion"" and ""Total State Machine"") are videos and I do not think they work as well with images. The other problem is this recording sounds a little short for the price of paying over $14.00. The best album to get from Test Department is The Unacceptable Face of Freedom (a masterpiece)."
5,Wonderfully Fresh!,"Although the kickoff song on this CD is called One Hit Wonder, to which the band refers to themselves in the lyrics. This CD shows off very brilliantly, that they are truly a terrific 60's band that has been able to bridge the decades. Their sound today remains vibrant and powerful, with some new and remade tracks on this CD. Hits such as, You Wouldn't Listen, L.A. Goodbye and Vehicle are a pure joy to listen to. The other tracks are very diverse and quite enjoyable. Jim Peterik has proven over the years that he is a wonderfully gifted singer, song writer and musician, and the rest of The Ides are equally impressive on this CD, the brass is hot! I highly recommend it to their many fans, old and new!"
5,A thoroughly good read.,"Books like these ought to be on everyones book shelf. 'The Forest Keepers' is a very good novel that cleverly blends story with social themes. The characters are real flesh and blood that exist in the real world, and not sterotypes. The plot is original with clever twists at every corner and you can't help but be curious as to the outcomes, most of which will surprise you. It's only after you've finished turning all the pages do you realise how well the author had you hooked."
2,people over 50 need not apply,"I just got my scale and tried it out, and I have to say it really makes me mad that the designers of this scale see no reason to give anyone over 50 a metabolic age rating. To them, I guess a 50-year-old and a 90-year-old are both over the hill, so why bother making distinctions?I spent the extra money primarily because this scale has been reported as being very accurate (repeatable) in the weight measurement, but since I spent so much money on the other features, I expect to receive them. I'm 60. As far as I can tell, I could be 10 years healthier than average, or 10 years less healthy than average, and I was looking forward to seeing what the scale said. But now I'll never know. I'm not sure if I'm more unhappy because I didn't get the information I expected, or because I feel that I've been treated with contempt because I'm at an age where they feel we can just all be lumped together. Either way, I'm disappointed."
1,Not A Good Information Source,Everyone reviewed this product in a very positive manner. I purchased this and compared the results vs my Body Fat Test at the Dr Office - and this device was off considerably ! I also purchased a Taylor Branded Body Fat Analyzer that apparently offers the same technology to measure body fat - and it was extremely close to the results that I received from my Dr.Even though Tanita was the first to offer Body Fat Monitors...I would say first is not best !
5,"Out with the old, in with the new","I saw the Innerscan Body Composition Monitor on ""I Want That"". I was very impressed and I purchase one for my daughter also. I gave my old scale away."
3,The scale is great - shipping was terrible,"The scale is fine. However, from the day I ordered the product, it took 21 days to arrive. Amazon stated that the product would ship in 24 hours. Considering I was charged for shipping, I should have gone with the supersaver free shipping - at least I would have received it sooner."
4,nice product,I really like my glass innerscan. I don't use all the functions very often but I am hoping to be able to monitor more than just weight loss.
5,Tanita scale,"Tanita BC533 Glass Innerscan body composition monitor is a wonderful product. It not only gives your weight, but tells you visceral fat % and much more. Very important for those who are diabetic."
4,Great for the athletic person,Got this scale for my athletic teenage son and he loves it. I think seeing a change in body fat rating helped him to lose those extra pounds and keep them off. Now if it would just encourage me...
5,Happy Customer,The scale was delivered in a timely manner. I found the instructions to set up the scale was easy. I like that multiple individuals can have their own personal setting. The look of the scale is very nice as well. Because of the glass and brushed nickle it blends in to the bathroom decor well.
3,Nice but unconfortable,Work well but it is unconfortable to operate. On the other side it is very nice looking.
2,MISSING MANUAL,"I am sure once i figure out how it works, it will be fine. the problem the items ships with out a maunual. emails to yahoo resulted in them telling me to look in the manual for the manufacture to then ask for the maunual. maybe it was the night shift."
4,Good scale but with some manufacturing flaws..!,I bought this scale for very basic purpose just to measure weight. And it seems to be very accurate so far. One thing I would complain about is the metal plate that is used to scan the body fat is coming off. For such an advance machine I think it is advisable to manufacturer to put a better glue..:-) Other than that it is a good machine.
5,Works great,"Really like this scale. Though there are a bunch of options on this scale, we use it mostly for basic weight use and once in a while for the body fat % measure. I would suggest that one read the manual that comes with the scale to understand how the various measurements are calculated, what they mean, etc....I found it very well written and detailed. Before I purchased the scale, I went to the manufacturers website and viewed the manual on their website. The accuracy seems spot on for weight. The 2/10 scale increment for weight is great. The scale also has a cool look that we like in the bathroom."
2,Works great,"Just recevied my Body Composition Monitor. Accurate weight and fat composition, the instructions aren't too clear about how to get other ratings. If you buy this item, you must step off the scale before obtaining additional measures. Found this out by going to the website. I would give this product 4 stars, but could not change the rating once submitted incorrectly!"
3,Tanita BC533,"Scale is aesthetically pleasing but not 100% accurate. The weight measurement is about 1.5 pounds off. A 50 pound weight weighed 51.5 pounds. Also, the body fat percentage will go up or down as you input different physical characteristics (i.e. height, weight, athletic activity, etc). If you have 20% fat, it should not change because you indicate that you never workout or workout 7 days a week. You can use this scale as a baseline to determine if you are losing fat but if you want accurate numbers, you really need a caliper or stop in at a gym and have them take the measurements."
3,It's OK,"Not very easy to use. Difficult to dicipher the readouts when standing up. If you get off to read, you can only get a couple of readings. Moving changes the readings. You really have to get off and on a couple of times and be ready to take the readings on the spot and then weigh in again. Then the manual tells you that some of the readings may not be valid. Looks nice; gives your weight. Don't expect a whole lot more."
4,So far so good,"My husband & I have had the scale for about a month now. It seems very accurate & we like it a lot, but I am uncertain as to the other features of the scale. The body fat percentages, for example, are questionable, yet we do not often utilize those ""extra"" features. I am very happy with the scale itself. Finally a scale with an accurate and consistent measurement."
4,Innerscan Success,"The Innerscan Body Composition Monitor does everything it says it does. I especially like the personalized settings. This makes it convenient for my daughter and myself to use the monitor and retain our personal information. The only problem I have is in reading the display screen. The numbers are large enough, however, not dark enough for me to read easily."
4,a different kind of tuning in,"I find the use of this scale for maintaining health and wellness useful and fun. How refreshing to think in terms of muscle mass, bone density, sufficient hydration, how many calories I could eat to maintain my current weight. I smile to see that my metabolic age is half of my chronological age, and when it isn't, I can evaluate the foods that I have eaten or activities that I have, or not, done. If the scale could make me breakfast, I would have given it 5 stars."
1,I am surprised they can sell this (false advertising),I am in the process of loosing wieght and bought the BC533 as it is a nice looking scale with a body fat measurement. The problem is the body fat measurement is no where near accurate. After reading 34% body fat after 3 weeks of exercise I went to the gym to get a checkup and I was 17% body fat. The guy at the gym recommended skin fold calipers. I have been using them for the last month.
1,Pretty but difficult,The Tanita BC533 Body Composition Monitor did not perform as expected. The small feature buttons did not have universal pictures and were hard to read at a standard height.
2,no very accurate,"i thought i had bought a great product, but after several times stepping on the scale i noticed dramatic differences in the results. the weight was working ok, but body fat% and so on was not so great. it all depended on what info you gave the scale. i wasnt aware that your body fat% could change depending on if you were male, female,active or not active.that was a big disapointment to me. i bought it for the body fat%. i was getting frustrated with working out without my wieght changing. i wanted to see if i might be building muscle, but come to find out i think i just paid a lot of money to know what my weight is."
4,very good,Must read the entire booklet to understand how to set and read your Tanita BC533 innerscan body composition monitor. Follow it precisely and it will give you accurate readings
4,"Accurate scale, useful body composition monitor","I bought this product 2 months ago, it is an accurate scale. the body composition monitor is useful, it gives an idea about body fat, muscle mass, basic metabolic rate, metabolic age. it is mostly accurate but it has to be done at the same time every night before dinner (not after exersice or shower or food)."
5,"great scale, lots of metrics","I'm a metrics-driven person and I love that this scale provides so many of them: weight, body fat, water %, muscle mass, estimated caloric intake, etc.I've always been active, but having these metrics really got me out of a plateau and gave me something to aim for."
4,Adults only!,"Seems O.K. Have used it a few times. Beware if you want to keep this in your bathroom as your everyday scale because exposing it to high humidity affects its operation. Also do not buy this if you are going to make it available to children because the glass platform can break if it is misused. Good product for adults, but not good for kids."
5,Heavyweight Scales,"The device claims to infer from the weight and galvanic data which it measures and height, age, sex, and activity level data which are entered by the user a number of conclusions about the somatic condition of the person standing on its platform. It also displays your weight to the nearest two tenths of a pound. I don't have the faintest idea what ""metabolic age"" is supposed to mean, but as mine is consistantly computed to be in the low twenties and I am far into my upper fifties I have to admit liking that particular feature - a lot. These scales aren't cheap, but they are well worth their cost if used within a serious program of exercise, diet, and weight control."
4,interesting new ideas,"The author claims that the writers of the Bible knew about contemporary Egypt, and for this reason, based themselves on it. He is against the popular idea that mythological elements in the Bible should be separated from historical facts. Some may say he is inconsistent in his terminology or historical facts, yet he brings a new idea up for discussion. An interesting book on a subject that very few people have the courage to discuss."
2,Shipping makes the cost prohibitive,"This is a simple, inexpensive, and yet useful item. The shipping, however, is three times the cost of the product itself.I understand that shipping even an empty envelope costs money, so I tried to buy several at once to combine the shipping cost. Instead, I was billed shipping for each! Until there is a way to combine shipping on these small items, I will shop elsewhere."
2,hardly noteworthy,"A tremendously silly movie that's only remotely watchable because of Alan Rickman's tremendous talent to deliver any lie with dignity and intrigue. Unless you are a huge Rickman fan (which, of course, I am), you may skip this one without any guilt."
4,A Real Pleaser,"This is a feel good movie from beginning to end. It's made with equal parts of melodrama, camp and comedy and has a great, finger- popping sound track. It's a spoof of all competitions and competitors that take themselves too seriously, while at the same time celebrating love and eccentricity. It left me smiling and wanting more."
3,Blow Dry Blew Me Away,Blow Dry had a unique cast Josh Harbin and Rachael Leigh had great on screen chemistry. This is a movie that is about the competive world of hair styling competions. Two rival teams are competing for the golden scissors. This takes you though the 4 day competion. It also shows you how important family can be. Very funny movie and entertaining. I started off thinking this movie was going to be a bomb but I was very pleased that it wasn't. With a cast like this you really can't go wrong. Try Blow Dry for a new look in a movie.
1,"hmmm, very much like a low budget ITV drama","I rented this vid with such high hopes for it. I was thinking, hmm Josh Hartnets in it, and he's well riuch, so he wouldn't choose to go into a film inless the script was ace would he? WEll yes he would, and so would Alan Rickman and so would Rachel Leigh Cook. My god !!! There was terrible Yorshire acents for one, there was a set designer who was trying to hard to hard to make an apparently 1970's looking set, every single part was clich'ed and the plot was about as pradictable as a trip to the toilet. But luckily it was one of those films that is so terrible it makes you laugh, so my 2.50 wasn't wasted completely. If your looking for a good Josh hartnett then go else where, like Halloween H20 or $0 days and 40 nights. If you want a decent Alan Rickman film go for Dogma, and if you want a decent rachel Leigh cook film, then go for She'll all that."
2,Hartnett's accent blows.,"I like hairdressing.This movie is abour hairdressing. And Professor Snape is fabulous as the Hairdresser. And so is Matt Sullivan, the wise cracking boy who has gone without sex for 40 days, is also a Hairdresser. As is Josie.I like hairdressing.Do you?"
3,Blow dry- feat. josh hartnett,"Blow dry is not one of the best films you may have ever seen, but nont the less, it's pretty darn good. Josh Hartnett is very hot in it, although he doesnt quite manage to nail the British accent."
3,Formulaic but pleasing,"Heartwarming, formulaic little tale set in northern England about a divided family of hairdressers who reunite when the biggest hairdressing competition on the continent is being held in their small hamlet. Natasha Richardson is excellent as the beautiful woman who once modeled and was married to Alan Rickman, but ten years prior left him for Rachel Griffiths. Now Rickman and his son Joshua Hartnett run their little barber shop without participating in the more festive aspects of their profession. Everything that is supposed to happen happens without many surprises, but along the way there are some good laughs and genuine moments. This one is worthwhile because of its cast."
5,Unexpected Gem of a Film,"I rented this movie without knowing anything about it other than it starred Alan Rickman and Josh Hartman. But I enjoyed it so much that I immediately purchased two copies of it, one for a friend and one for myself. The story is a little silly but the actor's performances are wonderfully low-key and humorous. This is one of my favorite British films yet."
4,Very entertaining for kids (toddlers),"Frankly I don't know why this series is so sought-after by toddlers like my children, but perhaps it is a generational difference and perhaps I will never understand. However, it is obviously very much in demand and very entertaining for little kids. My daughter watches this almost every day. We have lots of Dora programs aside from this. I even had to order some Dora dolls. They must be doing some great marketing. Only thing I don't like is all the Spanish mixed with English, as it may confuse some young kids which is what and may end up mixing languages into Spanglish. Huge commercial success, obviously."
5,My 2 year old loves it!,"My son loves this movie! It has a lot of his favorite episodes all on one movie!!Like all Dora movies,it gts him up & moving!!"
1,Showing 5 1/2 Minutes of Commercials to Captive Audience,"Our grandkids brought this for the overnighter. After you put the disk in your DVD player, you and the little ones are forced (they block all menu shortcuts) to watch 5 1/2 minutes of very hyped commercials for more Dora disks. If you mind being held captive to the marketing department of the company that produces this product, I would suggest to you that there are tons of DVDs for children that do not do this and most of them contain better content: e.g.: all the Disney titles, Peter Rabbit, etc.Now if your children or grandchildren demand Dora and you do not knuckle under, they might very well try to veto your decision, stage a protest or even a full-scale mutiny. All I can say is that good parenting is hard. But the end result is worth it."
5,8 Episodes in one!,I got this DVD because it had 8 episodes for the same price as Dora DVD's that have 3-4 episodes. I love that there are more options so I don't have to listen to the same episodes over and over. There's some varsity there with both old and newer episodes.
3,Odd tale ends with a surprise.,"Jumping the Queue is an unusually crafted story that begins with Matilda Poliport's attempt to end her life thwarted by timing, a non-event which sets the tone for the whole tale. Mary Wesley describes Matilda's environs with exquisite word pictures: her cottage, her neighbors, town. When matricide Hugh Warner stumbles into Matilda's life, things take an interesting turn, and they keep turning that way till the end. Jumping the Queue is an extraordinary story whose ending surprised me, and I'm hard to fool."
2,"Too minimal, even for ambient?","I'm not sure I've ever listened to a ""grayer"" album - it feels as though any emotional and personal touch of the artist has been stricken from the music. Even the oblique and alien sound textures of Autechre seem more inviting than the lifeless and remote tracks of ""Substrata"". Several moments of the album reminded me of the soundtrack to the Japanese anime ""Ghost in the Shell"" - I think I could appreciate these tracks more if they occured within a similar context. As is, there's not enough that catches my interest."
4,"Sligth disappointment, but still good","This, Geir Jenssen's third album as Biosphere, (not counting his collaboration with H.I.A. on Polar Frequencies, and the soundtrack he made for the Norwegian film Insomnia), comes as a slight disappoinment after the excellent Patashnik. There are a few too many tracks consisting of only droning noises and plinkety-plonk sounds which go nowhere to give this two thumbs up, but there are also some great trax. These are really good, and give ample evidence that Jenssen still is one of the most original and innovative musicians around."
5,Words Fail Me.,"I'm sure if I was something of a master wordsmith I could describe this album accurately enough so that you might clear your afternoon's appointments and head off to purchase it. Alas I am but a fool who's strengths lie elsewhere, somewhere, and so you must simply register the fact that I have taken the time to jot down a few sentences, and conclude from this that the album must in some way be worthy."
4,"Some great, greasy, fat funk! (4.5 stars)","There are a bunch of songs on here from artists I'd never heard of before, but it didn't matter! I bought the double CD, put the best tunes onto an 80 minute CD, and sold the original to a used CD store. It made me realize how good the best songs from this CD are! Even the James Brown song didn't make it to my compilation CD. Don't be put off by the inclusion of artists you haven't heard of -- it's worth the purchase! Try this site: www.unionsquaremusic.co.uk for more funk & soul CDs."
4,Good Resaw Blade,"This is not the best resaw blade I have used with the Jet 14"" bandsaw, but it is also not the most expensive one I have used. For the price, it is a very good blade and the blade sharpness has held up fine cutting 6"" thick oak, cherry, ash and walnut.The 4 teeth per inch gives fast and efficient resaw speed, the blade holds the line and very little finish sanding is required. For the money, it is a decent blade."
3,Sounds better than it is...,"The title is a promising one, if you're interested in JWB and the Lincoln assassination; and the compilation is thorough, if what you want is to have the complete known products surviving from JWB. The problem is that 90% of what does survive (thus 90% of this book) is really insignificant stuff that sheds very little light on the man's ideas, opinions, or thoughts. It's mostly brief, impersonal, non-revealing notes written to confirm theatrical engagements, &c., &c. Much of it is repetitive variations on a few business-oriented themes. Too bad this is al that survives from him!"
2,Fabulous fabric but clingy.,"Very soft,clingy & drapey fabric - great feel. Too clingy for my lumpbody. Would recommend ordering 1 or 2 size up for a loose fit to be more flattering for the not so perfect body."
4,Much better Baba book than most,"I recommend you go and visit Baba if you are interested enough in picking up this book. He is guiding you.But if you want to read up on him first, get this book over most others."
3,Too Much of a Good Thing,"Here we have yet another live DVD from Deep Purple. This one is neither bad nor good. It is interesting to hear Ian Gillan fumble over the words on ""Ted the Mechanic,"" and that gets you ready for the kind of performance you get here - just average. However, with just average Deep Purple can be pretty good.I love Steve Morse and what he brings to the band, but his playing is extrememly repetative, and since this is my 6th or so Morse DVD purchase, I find myself predicting riffs before they happen.Don't get me wrong,the band is in high form, but it sounds and looks like all the other DVD releases. If you have a lot of other Purple DVDs from this era, this one is nice but not essential. If you have none, this is a fine place to start."
5,The best one in my collection!,"If you are looking for one Deep Purple concert DVD to buy, this is it.. Come hell or high water is next..Very enjoyable!"
3,Purple Reign,"Pretty good stuff for later Purple. Morse is really good on the axe, and gillan still has the voice. Its not quit the same without Ritchie, but still worth the money."
2,1/8 in bandsaw blade,It may be because f lack of knowledge but I could never get the 1/8 inch blade to stay centered. It kept slipping off and finally broke. I replaced it with a 1/4 inch blade and had no trouble with it.
4,tragically excellent,"The nobility of America's war in Vietnam is front and center in this volume. Read it if you dare. The slim minority of US troops profiled in this work is, nonetheless, disturbing. Equally remarkable is the overwhelming majority that didn't engage in this behavior. Very well written, and well worth reading. You decide."
3,carbine .15 and five-point buck deer,"'Course it's an interesting read...but if the authors included the ""carbine .15"" and ""five-point"" buck deer, I'm wondering WHAT ELSE they screwed up. IHTFP"
5,A Realistic View of War,"This was an interesting book to read. One really can't condemn the members of Tiger Force without being in their shoes and experiencing what they did. Most of these soldiers were screened and chosen for their propensity for violence and willingness kill. Some people can retain their beliefs and remain true to their core morality, others are unable to do so.I wonder just what these ex-GI's feel to have this rehashed after all of these years."
1,Fairy Tale,"I found the book so unbelievable that I could not finish it. To anyone who has read much military history, this one is tough to swallow. Even ignoring all the technical military inaccuracies, it does not flow well and is a hard read.It's not difficult to believe that atrocities were committed but this is just too much, they just seem to shoot every unarmed civilian that crosses their path. All the while there are witnesses and other soldiers who are against what's happening and no one says or does anything.Whatever the authors of this book won a Pulitizer prize for they should go back to that and stay away from military history.Don't waste your money."
5,Tiger Tour de Force,"I thought the book was well written and well researched. I was surprised the writers won a Pulitzer Prize. Is it really news? I heard all this during the war. The zippo lighters, the ears, the free fire zones, the forced resettlement of the population we were ""saving"", the agent orange treatment of fertile, inhabited valleys, and the deeply disturbed survivors on both sides.I guess it is like the holocaust, each new generation has to hear it again in their own style, lest we forget. And God knows it is a timely lesson. Too bad those who most need to read it are not likely to do so."
2,Tell us something we DONT know already,"I was very much interested in reading more of the Special Ops. TIger Force group, however was very much disappointed in seeing the writings over these alleged ""atrocities"".The authors to this book attempt to put a face to war and package and sell their predispositions and opinions on the events. The bottom line is this --- WE ALL WERE NOT THERE!!! ---so how can these authors explain what went on and through the minds and misery of these men. It's unfortunate the main characters in this book will not share in the fortunes of the authors and publisher, i.e. Pvt. Sam Ybarra' family.Remember, VietCong Guerillas were equally brutal if not worse.I see 5 years from more of these types of authors providing their explanations and facts of what happened to these so-called ""atrocities"" of the current Iraq War, particularly those of the United States!Save your money ----- you better watching CNN for the more recent events and underlying predispositions"
1,GARBAGE LIES FABRICATIONS TRASH SLANDEROUS,"The authors of this book have twisted, fabricated and just plain lied about the facts. The key military people written about in this piece of toilet paper and who could refute the ""facts"" are all dead. Do not waste your money on this piece of contrived anti war leftist fiction."
4,heroes and villains,"A story of an ugly chapter in Vietnam, that took a toll in lives then and continues to do so. A story buried for years by some of the same people who messed up this decade. Informative, and reading that one needs in order to understand the cost of war."
4,Tiger Force,"This book is in excellant condition, it looks like I just bought it from the store. Its really good, so far, its about Vietnam, and a group of soliders who were out there at the time. It talks about what they did, saw, felt, and how they changed being out there from good people to cold-blooded murderers. This book is pretty graphic and I wouldnt recommend for yougsters. Also, this book has a lot of ""military slang"" in it, it helps if you know a little about the military before reading it. A little past halfway through the book, it switches from them being in Vietnam, to them being investigated for the war-crimes they committed (they are incredibly detailed) while there. This book makes you WANT to read it, I cant put it down!"
5,Fishpond Waterlog Hydration Resevoir,"I own two of these hydration pouches. The rubber they're made from is sturdy and the screw lid is leak proof. I also like the hard gasket/handle around the screw lid which makes the pouch easy to handle and control when full. The wide mouth opening also makes it easy to clean. Here's a tip: put a little fresh lemon or lime juice in your water. Not only will the water taste good, but the citrus will help keep it clean."
2,Not Up to Par,"Even the world's greatest living military historian admits to being ""mystified"" by the Iraq war in his opening chapter. The following chapters are more in the Keegan style and provide a solid background on Iraq and its place in the region. Iraq did not provide the sustained episodes of combat that Mr. Keegan may be used to detailing, and hence his work is brought up significantly short, as there are no great tank or infantry battles for him to cover. His analysis of the war's aftermath is brief and unsatisfactory, especially when that is where the real war began. Mr. Keegan wrote about his subject too early in its history and the results leave the reader as equally mystified as the author. Far more highly recommended would be Yossef Bodansky's ""The Secret History of the Iraq War"", David Zucchino's ""Thunder Run"", or ""Generation Kill"" by Evan Wright."
1,Just more pro-neocon propaganda,"Relying on this book to give the truth about the Iraq war is just as good as relying on Rush Limbaugh to give real news. In other words, if you want to soak yourself with more rightwing propaganda, then this book is for you. For non-partisan reporting, there are better books than this Bush/Cheney defending nonsense."
1,We've long lost and still are losing the Iraq War,"This book ignores the true reality of the Iraq War in that the only reason government rushed to this war was for oil. As a true conservative, I don't appreciate politicans who hide under the label ""conservative"" while at the same time ramming destructive policies and rushing this country into unneeded wars. No, the Iraq War is not Vietnam War but far worse."
1,Poor excuse for a book,"I thought Keegan was a ""serious"" historian. This book contains little to do with the actual war itself - you would have picked up more on how it was fought on a 2nd rate cable news channel - indeed I beleive thats where he did all his research for this poor excuse for a ""serious"" miltary analysis of the iraq war."
2,Reads more like a history of Iraq than of the 2003 war,"The Iraq War is an okay book. Having recently read Blackhawk Down, this is a comparatively much drier work that is more along the lines of a military history book than a book that is a good read. My biggest gripe with the book is that it comes across as a work that was originally meant to be a history of Iraq and Saddam Hussein that was repositioned to be a document of the war after it started. This is a 254 page book. The book doesn't begin to cover the actual start of the war until page 147. A chapter on the war's aftermath starts on page 204. The subject of the book only occupies about 1/5th of the entire volume. The war's coverage is done in a very broad fashion where more attention is paid to the unit IDs of the military units involved than in the actual events that took place. It shouldn't be hard to find online sources that cover the war in more depth than this book did."
1,"Bad, Bad, Bad","I bought these radios to replace Model FV700R due to poor audio reception quality but guess what, they are just as bad if not worse. The reception cuts out and you find yourself needing to repeat messages over and over. I have a pair of FV200s which are only rated at 1 mile range and they have 10 times better audio quality than this more expensive model does. I do believe Motorola has a serious design flaw in their radios. I think their Quality program is deficent. Oh by the way I bought them from motorola store and paid $96.00 shipped, which a you can see I got screwed based on what they are selling for on Amazon, my mistake!DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!"
5,A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!!!,"Just incredible!! To eject or not to eject. When there's nowhere to go but down, pilots in trouble face the ultimate challenge. With test footage never before seen..hear what the pilots say in there own words.WATCH!!"
2,Not the best Cutty.,In retrospect I wish I hadn't purchased this. Not too many hard hitting rhythmic tracks that Cutty is famous for.
3,Carries over better with the Furious Five,"Bring in Melle Mel and the others and this is much better than Grandmaster alone...they sound like a band, a message to convey and more smoother."
2,A very biased view on Riemann Solver,Many important references are not included. The description of the HLLE scheme in the book is incomplete and partially wrong. The reader is referred to the original paper.
1,Reads like a cheap Hollywood novel rather than history,"This book, like many historical works published in the last several decades, is intellectually dishonest. The very first page White tells us the pope ""remembered fondly the attentions of his lover earlier that morning"". This reads like a cheap Hollywood novel rather than a quality historical book. History can be fascinating and the story interesting without resorting to cheap fabrications such as this. How does Mr. White know what the pope was thinking that morning? Very poorly done. Unfortunately this book would be worthwhile for the Vatican as ...[burnable material]..., and nothing else."
3,An OK read about the trial and death of a heretic.,"Since I have not studied philosophy all that much, I did not know of the heretic Bruno and his burning at the stake. Bruno believed in the Catholic Church, he just didn't believe in how it came about in its philosophy. Bruno was a native of southern Italy, and self exiled himself to Switzerland, Germany, France, and England. After his lonely life of exile and teachings, he returned to Venice, with a thought of trying to convince the Pope of his thinking. The Catholic Church thought little of him, tried him in the Inquisition, and then eight years later burned him at the stake. Bruno's death was gruesome.Many of the previous reviewers have held the author liable for a weak story. I though Bruno's life biography was OK, and that he justifiably made some assumptions on his belief. This is a good example of the Inquisition's affect on life in old Europe."
4,Kenneth as Woody.,"While the movie itself was pretty uneventful and seemed to drag, the absolute magnificence of Kenneth Branagh's performance made it worth watching. I think what a couple of previous reviewers may have missed is that the male lead was written by Woody for Woody. He, thankfully, had the wisdom to know he would not be able to believably play that role--with Charlize and Winona falling all over him. So, he got someone else to play him for him. Kenneth does a remarkable Woody Allen. The argument in the park is a prime example. So to the reviewer who said that leading men in Woody Allen films should stop trying to be Woody, please realize that sometimes that is the whole intent, and realizing that can make the whole film richer."
2,DVD Edition is so poor !,"Even if this movie deserves 4-5 stars (lots of jokes, funny situations, and despite what other comments says, really good acting) I can only give it two because of DVD edition. No alternative language, no subtitles, no bonus material, nothing. You'd get the same on TV. What's the point ? Is it soooo expensive to try to get some quality ? Hello Miramax, is anybody alive ?"
3,Not Much To Celebrate,"__________________Branagh's portrayal of Woody Allen's role wasn't exactly annoying, but it wasn't particularly endearing either. This movie was not too enjoyable, although Leonardo DeCaprio was a bright spot. This one seemed to be a little slapdash, not to the point of ""Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy"", but clearly it isn't one of his best. Bottom of the midrange. Had he made this one in the 1970s it might have gone down as a classic. Not anymore."
4,Full of throwaway lines,"I assume that Kenneth Branagh imitates Woody Allen here because Allen himself is now too old to keep playing the woman-chasing schlub who ends up with women way too attractive for him. Maybe this isn't classic Woody, but it's pretty good stuff."
2,the woody allen clone,Kenneth Branagh's irritating Woody Allen imitation ruins this movie. A waste of a good cast and certainly a waste of a typical excellent performance by Judy Davis. Woody's acceptance of this imitation says something about his ego. For Allen fans or for Davis fans--maybe.
4,"Good, not great, but good","I've seen many Woody Allen films, and while this isn't the best, it's not the worst either. Some complain that the film is in black and white, but it didn't really bother me at all. In fact I think that it helps support the premise by giving the media driven Hollywood a very dark tone. Pretty much the only thing that bothered me was Kenneth Branagh's performance. Through out the whole film he attempts to imitate Woody's acting style and it starts to get on your nerves after a while. However the other great characters and rich plot can help you see past that. In the end I really wish I could give it a 4 . I'd recommended to fans of other Allen films, but I don't think the average movie fan would enjoy it."
4,You have to see this movie!,"This movie is pretty good. it is all in Black and White, but after a while you get used to it. Most of the male charecters are unlikeable. If you are a Leonrdo fan, I recomend it. But if you aren't I still do, because his apperence in the movie is very short and he has a unlikeable chasrecter. This movie is funny and I think you schould watch it. Enjoy!"
3,Branagh's Impersonation of Woody,"The most annoying thing about this commentary on the ""star"" system in America was watching Kenneth Branagh personify Woody Allen, down to the ticks and stutters that characterize classic Allen films. The usual fascination with surface features of women lead him from bed to bed, never satisfied because he can't seem to engage in emotional or spiritual intercourse. He only thinks he knows what makes his partner tick, and he's too busy telling her to listen to her perspective. In a way, this is a commentary on much of male behavior in a culture that is engendered to favor the male point of view, starting with fairy tales, and winding up in the land of celebrity, emotionally celebate."
3,I just don't see what's all the critism!,"Before renting this movie all I heard fro people is how bad this movie was! what's wrong with it! Okay I'll be the firt to admit-it's not one of the greatest films ever made and certainly NOT Allen's BEST! Most people look at this as a comedy,I don't! I see it more as a drama. The movie has a serious message(How dumb people and are country is! I'm not saying everyone is dumb.But,yes their are peple who do foolish things.And we as a country celebrate and accept very odd things a perfect example is pokemon) and that message gets through clear. not to mention Allen's great directing and some great acting."
2,A Poor Man's La Dolce Vita,"I dont understand why Woody Allen felt the need to make this movie. Fellini did it beautifully decades ago. Allen adds nothing to the classic. Instead of Woody Allen portaying himself, he has kenneth Branaugh do it. Without giving anything away, the Woody Allen character acts inconsistently to keep a senseless pointless story line moving. The talented Leonardo Dicaprio and the stunning Charlize theron are not enough to save this movie. it is pleasant to look at but clearly Allen has nothing to say. I have come to expect more from a Woody Allen production. If you want to see the social life of movie stars and the media see the masterpiece La Dolce Vita."
2,Dull,"I'm a Woody Allen fan. Yeah, I like his neurotic genius, how he writes such intellectual dialogue between real people.But this movie was so freaking dull. Geez. And to be in black and white too. That makes it even duller. I was really disappointed. The story needed to be a little more compelling. Nothing interesting seemed to happen."
2,Could not reach the end...,"Man, I love most of Woody Allen's movies, but I could not reach the end of CELEBRITY. AFter the first fifteen minutes I realized was in for a journey of perseverance, but I failed: I was simply not in the mood to watch a film that I surely would not enjoy.Until the part I watched, I did not like the pacing, the plot or the characters. I tought the movie was slow, boring, lifeless. Probably, the so-called ""authentic"" WOody Allen faans will say I'm nuts and that the movie is a masterpiece. I disagree."
1,The end of genious,"This long, cynical, and pointless movies is a shell of the great insightful films Mr. Allen used to create."
1,Perhaps the worst film ever made.,"It is apparently impossible to give a film 0 stars, so I have had to give it one. A Godawful mess bereft of wit, rhythm, or interest. Kenneth Branagh is alternately irritating and embarrassing as he does his Woody impression for two hours. The only good in this film is Leonardo DiCaprio's 15 minutes, during which he blows the stagey, theatrical, northeastern smarty-pants segment of the cast out of the water. Seriously, if you enjoy this film on any level, there is something wrong with you. And I like Woody Allen."
3,typical Woody Allen movie,"I like Woody Allen's movies but this one not as good as most. Kenneth Branagh's character acted too much like Woody does. It was nice to see various celebrities within their own little story line, connected with Branagh's character. All in all it was an okay movie but one has to be a big Woody Allen fan to enjoy it."
1,One long bad imitation,"Not just one, but several characters, seem to be doing poor imitations of Woody Allen. Not sure of the purpose of the black and white. At certain points, you just want to ask the characters to shut up, but maybe that is the point."
2,Annoyingly Typical Woody Allen,"I've tried to watch Woody Allen movies before, but his neurotic style simply gets on my nerves. I just want to say ""Shut up and quit whining"" while watching him. I laughed when Kenneth Branagh's character's manuscript was thrown into the harbor. He deserved it. Some statements about how this country picks celebrities were insightful, but overall I was ready for the movie to end. It seems that Allen wants to live out his fantasies with unattainable women through movies like this. Woody, get a life!"
3,Surprisingly tame,"When Marc was signed to Virgin in the mid-80s, he issued many records that never came out in the US. It all finally saw US release in 1997 on Thirsty Ear Records. This one is his most successful solo chart LP, and it contains ten overly moody tales of lust and despair with the accompaniment of a backing band called the Willing Sinners. This also includes CD-Extra promo videos for the three fair singles, ""Stories of Johnny,"" ""This House is Haunted"" and ""Love Letters."""
3,Good Almond,"One of the better, early Almond CD's, this one includes such highlights as ""The Flesh Is Willing"" and ""I Who Never"". His hyper-romanticism is tempered by the chamber pop settings, and the lyrics are the great gothic overstatement he was born for."
2,Taes Sonata,Tae's Sonata is pretty good book. I rated it 2 from 1-5.The book tells you one reason a friendship can be broken. I think it was a good book because it tells about a girl's life and her culture and helps you to understand not to make fun of anyone that is different.
3,Well...,"This book isn't the greatest book. It's a little too shallow to be a great book. The plot isn't really interesting and is too simple. This book is good for Children though to walk in other people's shoes. It was very realistic for me because being a korean girl, I understand how tae must feel. It's too simple though."
2,tae's sonata,tae's sonata was ok but i didn't really like it so i gave it a 2 because it was really boring.it didn't have any interest to me because it doesn't have anything i would do except go skating and thats why i gave it a 2.
2,disapointed,"This book taes sonata was really dissapointing for me. I thought that it was going to be a happy story. But in the end it was a sad story. If i had a chance to read this again or not, I would not.This book taes sonata was a waste of my time. The only reason that I gave it a 2 is because if you are haveing a fright with your friends. Then you and your friends should read this book. It teaches you that friendship is everything."
5,A really great book!,"This is a wonderful book. It made me feel really good to know that Josh, the boy Tae likes, isn't a jerk like the other Royals. Tae's feelings are really believable. I could really relate to her, especially when her best friend Meg betrays her. Read this book to find out how!"
4,I like this book,I like this book because of how the characters react and how Tae's mom sounds weird when she talks in English and how all the characters act. I like when the Author wrote a secret how Tae had a crush on Josh Morgan. This thing happened to the girls in the world and this is what they have to go through.
3,OK Game Not the best but Good but sadly short,"I got this game last Christmas as a present from Santa. When i first played it i was amazed, but i beat the game in 2 days. So the game is sadly too short."
4,It's Okay,"The Guardian's Key is an .....okay story. Dara is likeable even if somewhat gullible, she is still intelligent, brave and has a good resolve. Her scenes with Lord Vanian are well written and leave you eager for the next scene between the two. I like Lord Vanian's character, he has just the right mixture of arrogance, bitterness, charming appeal and is at times innocently perplexed by the opposite sex to solidify the story. My issues with the book is that she goes on this quest because she wants to marry the man she thinks she loves and as we learn more about this man she loves it becomes clear he is not worthy. It takes Dara more than 3/4 of the book to figure this out for herself. Now while I understand this may have been necessary for Dara's character development I think she should have come to terms with this earlier on and then perhaps the story could have moved on a bit more quickly.All in all the book is a decent read."
3,The ending ruined the book,"This book was really great, suspenseful, full of action but the end just really disappointed me. I would recommend it, it had a great plot. He goes through many adventures and meets new friends in Russia."
2,Eh...,This book was only about 10 percent commentary on being in one's 30. The rest was the interviewees' reflections of all aspects of their lives. I had to repeatedly skim pages to find portions of the book that were actually reflective of its title.
5,Yo this might blow up to be nominated for a grammy,Donell is going to blow up. Donell has the talent and the skills to do it. After reveiwing his first album in 1996 he should have won a grammy for that but life ain't always fair. Donell Love Ya Bra keep doin watcha do for da ladies. My lady gets her groove on to ya music
5,Donells song is so beautiful!,Donells song is my favorite out of all the artist that came out this year. I have been a fan of his music since his cd My Heart. I am greatly looking forward to the day his second album is released.
4,Yet another great band doomed to obscurity,"The Only Ones were immortalized by the single ""Another Girl, Another Planet"", but this compilation of the best moments from the band's first two British albums (""The Only Ones"" and ""Even Serpents Shine"") proved they were far more than one hit wonders. Peter Perrett's vocals were saturated with a weird, ...charisma, lacking in neither melody nor emotion even though he sounded like the sulky, pockmarked kid contemplating suicide in the back corner of the classroom. The band behind him was made up of (if you'll excuse the term) professional musicians - stubborn old musos with enough chops and experience to defiantly inject drama and subtlety into the simple three-chord-bamalama of late 70's punk. Consequently - and quite naturally - the Only Ones were exiles of their own era, never fitting in to any flavor-of-the-month scene or hyped sub-genre. In other words: rock & roll."
4,power pop fun,"I really dig this record for two reasons: it's fun and it's really catchy. The singer kind of sounds like Steve Shelley of the Buzzcocks with nasal cojestion, but it's great. This is one of those records that great to listen to in the car on a warm sunny day with all the windows down. It's a great, catchy, feel good, post punk/power pop album. Highly recommended."
3,No frills CD.....,"This is certainly a no frills cd. No introduction or lead-in. Although I do find it useful, it is also very, very short."
5,Realy Good,"This movie was Realy Good. If I had to compare it to anything else i've seen, it would be the movie, ""Crash"". Which I loved tremendously as well.Hey, it's a great film with a full circle ending. You will NOT be disappointed."
3,"Good breadth, little depth","This movie definitely has a lot of firepower in terms of its stars, the plot lines are interesting, and the characters are appealing. That said, because of the five separate story lines and the two hour running time, the amount of focus limited how much any one relationship could be developed. A good movie for romantics who don't mind a few tears!"
5,This movie is the best movie ever made!,It was such a good movie because of the pretty Gillian Anderson. One thing that I like about her is she is a good romodel for younger kids to look up to!!!
2,Skip the DVD,The pixelation is horrible on this DVD. I had to pretend I was watching the movie on a damaged holodeck to even make it viewable. Go for the VHS if you really must have this movie...no joke it is that bad. +There are no extras on the DVD anyway. The acting is good...but not great and the whole thing is a bit contrived...but overall if you want to see a bunch of great actors coast through a romantic movie... can you say date night?...then this is a good movie... practice saying the cliches with the actors.
1,Well,I got the movie but it won't play in any of my dvds. i took it to a friends house and we watch it on her laptop and it still didn't work. it is a great movie i have seen it before.
5,EXQUISITE.,"I don't often shower all the 5 stars in my reviews here at Amazon, but this precious film deserves 6!An amazing star cast, a theme that will have you guessing until the end how all the entertaining but diverse vignettes are connected, some very mature and intelligent humour, and above all some enchantingly memorable and sincere dialog about life, relationships, love.Mind you, none of the characters is in a simple straightforward predicament. Angelina Jolie especially pitches in an absolutely stunning performance, although everyone is convincing and memorable in their role.What a cleverly crafted movie. You know the satisfaction you feel when you've just had a complete meal, that's what I'll bet you'll feel.Highly recommended absorbing film, for *owning*, not just for seeing once. It's one of those."
5,Had to own this one.,"LOVE this film & it was a bargain deal, especially for a film out of production for years! Exactly as described, fast shipping."
2,A waste,"A good cast in a waste of a story. Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands, Jon Stewart and Gillian Anderson, Ryan Phillipe and Angelina Jolie, Anthony Edwards and Madeline Stowe are all couples with their own stories, Jay Mohr is a dying son and Ellen Burstyn is his mother, and Dennis Quaid is ?. These characters and their stories all come together, but it takes so long to get to the narrative's ending that I didn't care less what happened to anybody. Stewart and Anderson are bright spots, and Jolie is promising. Mostly though, a waste of time."
5,"Dynamic cast, wonderful stories all","I was introduced to Angelina Jolie in this film and was hooked. She's fabulous as the youngest daughter of Sean Connery and Gena Rowlands. Marital complications, personal apprehensions and wonderfully HUGE dogs and a one-eyed cat add to this quilt of family members' lives that segway through beautifully utilized sunrises and sunsets w/John Barry's flowing music. Madeline Stowe, Dennis Quaid, Jon Stewart, and several other castmembers round out a complex group of players dealing with careers, relationships and personal insecurities. This is a keeper.PS. Remember this, the next time you run for an elevator ;)"
1,BORING AND NOT FUN AT ALL,We rented this for Valentines Day= What a disappointment! It went from one depressing scene to another. Don't be fooled by the trailer!
4,Under Rates Movie,this movie went straight to video and it was my sister who directed me towards the movie. It is very funny even when the mood gets serious
4,"IT'S ONLY ME, BUT:",THIS MOVIE IS ABOUT 4 MODERN COUPLES COMING TOGETHER AND ABOUT HOW THEY CONNECT AND HOW THEY ARE CONNECTED. ANGELINA JOLIE GIVES A PREFORMANCE THAT SHOWS SIGNS OF HER GREATNESS IN ACTING. JM
5,Jon Stewart is not naked enough,"This is a great movie, except for one thing: Jon Stewart is not naked enough. And his major bed scenes are with a dog."
3,Cute Movie,"So many love stories, so little time. I've never seen a movie quite like this. It's very cute and not too corny (but it kind of IS). My favorite storyline is Angelina Jolie and Ryan Phillipe's. They had good chemistry and Phillipe can hold ground when Jolie is present. Gillian Anderson and Jon Stewart are cute in this movie too. Jay Mohr's story is so sad though. What I dislike is (I don't wanna give away any hints of the ending) how attatched some couples become of each other in such short time. Told you it was kind of corny."
5,Best Romantic Movie of the Year!,"It's the best of the best. The spirit of independent films is not to make something provocative or trying to make it look like ""highly artistic""; it's really about to tell a story as truthful as possible. It doesn't have to be realistic; we've had enough of that in real life. I think that's the reason it makes me go back to this film over and over; it tells the story with such truth- fulness. I love it. It will always be one of my favorite films of all time."
5,Unexpectedly brilliant,"Playing By Heart has recently replaced Singles for me as my favorite movie. It absolutely blows me away. Just to see Sean Connery and Jon Stewart interacting with Scully (I mean Gillian Anderson's character Merideth) was worth it! Kudos to Anthony Edwards, Angelina Jolie, and Dennis Quaid as well. This movie has the uncanny ability to make you cry with sadness one moment and happiness the next. This is definitely tremendous movie-making. Oh, and the ending - you will never have seen it coming."
2,"Good Movie, Horrible DVD","I really enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theater, but the DVD is terrible. There is bad pixelation throughout - to the point where it just becomes unbearable to watch. Stick to the VHS."
3,"Excellent Movie, Shame About the DVD","This is one of the best human dramas I have seen in a long while. Brilliantly acted, directed, written and shot. Unfortunately the DVD release by Miramax has been botched. Not only is there bad pixilation in a lot of scenes, but the film has only been Letterboxed at about 1.75:1, not 2.20 as stated on the packaging. As a result a lot of the glorious photography is badly cropped. The picture even zooms out at the end to get all the end credits in! Anamorphic would have been nice, and an extra or two even nicer. Shame."
5,you will fall in love with it from beginning to end,"this is the only good movie with a great cast the best couple are keenan and joan played by phillippe and jolie.jon stewart was funny and terrific . you will cry at the end. after watchin white squall,i know...,cruel intentions.and know playing by heart ryan phillippe is the best actor going right now damnit."
3,"Okay, but should have been more...","This film is a very mixed bag. On the one hand it has a stellar cast, with the premise of taking stories concerning couples - that at the end intervene into one family. On the other hand, at its bad moments it reminded me of ""Loveboat""! I absolutely cringed by some of the dialogue, cliches by tons that many of the actors had to chew. One has to see great actors like Sean Connery (with a nothing of a role) and Gena Rowlands in such a banal situation with no originality whatsoever (talk about formula writng!) Other couples did fairly better... when suddenly the story of Angelina Jolie appeared... now that was great! It was as if it was written by someone else. It was smart, touching and alive. Angelina is absolutely wonderful... The end is kitcshy & warm, and surprising, but imagine if before so had been better written!"
4,Depressing but thought provoking,We like to pretend the world of these characters does not exist and even if we may admit it does most of us don't want the details. It opened a window to a new reality for me. I appreciated the author's notes at the end; I did not assume incest between Lee and Earlene though she states that many did. I found myself profoundly grateful for my education and resources which have spared me this type of existence. I found Earlene to be a likeable character and the lack of fairy tale solutions gave credence to the sad realities of poverty.
5,Amazing,Absolutely compelling story. I found myself wishing better lives for these characters. I was riveted to the end by the emotional rollercoaster. A true depiction of the hard life of people in northern maine. A true gem.
2,Strange book - never got into it,"I purchased this book because I saw that people who liked ""Back Roads"" by Tawni Odell bought this title. I liked ""Back Roads"" a lot, but just didn't like this book at all. The story jumps forward repeatedly with very little context. The reader is left trying to figure out what year it is, and what is going on. I did not think the characters were developed well at all, and am still left wondering why the primary female character married the man she did.Depressing story, strange characters, and not what I thought it would be. I struggled to get through it."
2,Not wholly satisfying,"Carolyn Chute is well able to evoke a sense of place in which these Northeastern hillbillies live by describing the detritus of their yards as well as their lives. However, the story meanders--again, not unlike the aimless day-to-day existence of the characters she describes. Her characterization provides the Beans and their friends and neighbors with a rough dignity, although not enough to keep them from seeming pitiable to a ""sophisticated"" urban readership."
1,huh,"I do not abandon books in the middle but could not continue to read this book. By page 100 I could feel my IQ dropping.If you are considering this book, put it down and run!"
1,dreadful!!,this book will put you under in minutes. Its lacking in storyline and tries desperately to hide its lack of content under shrouds of style that is sorely lacking as well. Not worth the used price!
5,"Fascinating, disturbing, moody - brilliant!","This is not a novel for those looking for a simple, pre-digested read with a typical setting-action-climax structure. This is a literary novel - rife with atmosphere, amazing imagery and allegory - and well worth the extra brain-cell workout it might take to discover all the nuances. Even without the analytical approach, you'll enjoy it as a fresh and unsettling picture of poor poor poor life in America - it's a window to another world."
3,Good,"I bought these for my picky betta. It took him a few days to eat the food now He will put them in his mouth and 3 minutes later spit it out eventually he eats it.The only bad thing about this product is the have a very strong fish smell, so you have to store them in a rubber maid or something.Other than that the tank is clear and my betta eats it!"
1,not for that price,"I think it's a little more expensive for what it is! I could get one from Walmart for half the price. When I was buying this T-Shirt, I was looking for a white soccer shirt, but, it wasn't it! It was a waste of money."
5,London Refrain,Book arrived quickly and in shape described. I am very satisfied with the seller. Thanks.
3,Disappointing,It doesn't include enough of the characters from previous books in the series and introduces too many new characters without offering much character development. Very disappointing compared to the previous books in the Zion Covenant series. I'm not motivated to read it like the others.
5,London Refrain,"London Refrain is book 7 in the Zion Covenant Series by Bodie and Brock Thoene. This series is a historical fiction about the reign of Adolf Hitler and they weave their own fictional characters in actual historical events throughout the series. The writing keeps me interested and I learn as I read, too. They don't try play down the horrors of what that time was about, but they also give you some hero's to root for weaved inside the story. There with the historical information there is also romance, mystery and of course drama. When I finish one book I can't wait to see what happens to the characters in the next book. Many times I look up the history on line to learn about events mentioned in the book that I didn't learn in a classroom or that I had forgotten. I highly recommend their books not just this series but other book series of theirs as well."
2,"Don't buy all three of the ""new"" Zion Covenant books","If you're a dedicated fan of the Thoene's Zion Covenant, Zion Chronicles series, you'll be very disappointed if you're expecting completely new material from these three books. London Refrain has the most new material, but the other two books are entirely taken from Twilight of Courage. A few sentences are added, but only enough to facilitate an additional story line added in London Refrain (which really doesn't ring true to the original story in Twilight of Courage). If you really wanted more on Murphy & Elisa, London Refrain gives you some of that story line. My advice, go ahead and buy book 7, but skip books 8 & 9 unless you've never read Twilight of Courage. Or, buy them just because you want your collection to be complete."
4,London Refrain,"The print was very small and hard to read, but it did not come in a kindle book, but was number 7 in the series. I was upset because the story didn't end for my favorite people in the book. Now I have to read number 8 and 9 and still don't know what happened. There are too many new charactors in book number 8 and I have not read #9 yet. There are many typo's in the books.But I am committed to read the whole series. I love all the history the Thoene's give us."
5,A surprisingly good film!!,"This was such a great movie! I really wasn't expecting much - it was a friend's choice. But the film has a really great feel to it. Its got a very satisfying quality to it. Matthew Modine is really good in this one. I don't want to spoil the movie, but there are also some really funny moments. I would watch this film again and again."
3,Modine is why I bought this.,I saw Modine in WIND and wanted to see more of his work. I was pleased with this one. I loved WIND. I think you will watch this a couple of times if it remains in your video library.
5,I never reviewed this book!,"I submitted a review for David E. Carter's book, ""Logo Power"" about 5 years or so ago to Amazon. It was in the right place for a long time, but when you've written about 1,000 reviews for Amazon, you don't go back and check the status of them. It wasn't until I got an e-mail from someone interested in this book that I found out that my review had been moved to the wrong author's book. I've never read Ms. Solomon's book, so I cannot review it. I updated the review for Mr. Carter's book (ISBN 0823066037) and submitted it. Unfortunately, after you've submitted a review, you can only edit the review, but not the star rating system... so this review stands at 5 stars even though I never read it."
5,Minty Fresh,"This conditioner has a really pleasant citrus fragrance, little light on the mint. Leaves my hair nice and soft. Will probably buy it again. Would get 5 stars if it was a little less expensive."
3,Not what I expected,"There were some interesting elements to this documentary, but it was not what I expected. I lost interest halfway through but kept watching to make sure that I wouldn't miss something wonderful at the end. That didn't happen."
2,Difficult to Watch.,"Viewed: 5/12Rate: 35/12: More like Y for Yawn...the film contains two annoying aspects: long winded narration and overdone guerilla film editing. After five minutes of either, the eyes and the ears will grow tired. It's a tough film to watch, and Orson Welles was certainly full of it. His prime was already past post Citizen Kane, and he had a difficult time recapturing it. I guess we have him to blame for the garbage dizzy editing that are too frequently used in today's films. And of course, some may find the film interesting, but I found it quite commonplace and dull that it ceased to matter. Forgeries are everywhere through different forms. So, nothing new. All in all, once again, Y for Yawn is more like it."
3,a documentary of fakery,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.""F for Fake"" known in France as ""Vérités et mensonges"" is a documentary mainly on the life of art forger, Elmyr de Hory, and Clifford Irving who wrote a phony biography of Howard Hughes.It talks about the details of their lives and many other aspects of fakery throughout the ages. The film is presented by the great actor Orson Welles.The DVD has some fine special features alsoDisc 1 contains the film with optional audio commentary by Oja Codar and Gary Carver. There is also an introduction by Peter Bogdanovich and a 9 minute trailer.Disc 2 contains a biography of de Hory, an 88 minute film about Orson Welles' unfinished projects, a 60 minutes interview with Clifford Irving, and a 1972 telephone press conference with Howard Hughes exposing Irving's fraudulent biography.The DVD also contains some fine liner notes with more information.This is a film I recommend."
4,A Cinematic Juggling Act,"His last major work as a filmmaker, Orson Welles' ""F for Fake"" (1973) survives as a rough-edged yet provocative essay on the art of fraud. In this instance, we have three noted subjects: art forger extraordinaire Elmyr de Hory, Clifford Irving (the novelist who conned the world as Howard Hughes' ""authorized biographer"") and Welles himself. Editing plays a vital role as the Great Orson maintains his semi-documentary juggling act for 90 minutes. Fittingly enough, ""F for Fake"" reveals more about the creator of ""Citizen Kane"" than the minor curiosities he examines. Welles ends his cinematic odyssey with an affectionate wink."
5,"WHAT IF THERE WERE NO ""EXPERTS""?","With all the fury and venom expended on the question of what is art, this excellent film of Welles should be required viewing. Welles reminds us that, ultimately, the only art critic you need to worry about is yourself. Listen very carefully in this film to Welles recitation of Rudyard Kipling's poem; the crux of this film is contained in those lines. We are, each of us, Masters and Artists. What does it matter what anyone else thinks? Secondly, this film is also a little frightening. Almost 30 years after its making the tyranny of ""experts"" in everything from litigation to art continues to confound us. We continue to sacrifice common sense and our own autonomy to the ""experts"" . Finally, this film is just plain fun. Fake? EVERYTHING IS FAKE... everything is art... in spite of ""experts""."
2,Welles has lost it,"Orson Welles was a master of film. But not this film. While I appreciate the message he is trying to convey, his ""cleverness"" is off the deep end. This film is like a big ego-trip for Welles. He's so proud of how clever he is. But the film is a mess, like paranoid, disjointed ramblings. In his younger days he would have executed this with a more subtle style. Clever is most clever when it is not obvious. In this film he beats you over the head with the ""subtext"" and thinks he's cleverly deceptive by trying to hide it in a jumbled-up the story line. I'm sorry I wasted my time to watch it. I would have turned it off, but given my high respect for Welles, I continued, expecting a revelation or twist. Alas, no, it was just a stupid movie."
1,watching this must have been karmic penance for badly boring someone in a past life,"Whether lounging in a field of mustard flowers, waxing drunk in an affected ""traveler's accent"" on the, ahem, realness of reality, or mumbling about Chartres Cathedral and the fallibility of man, ""who must, in the end, die,"" Orson Welles slurs his way through this pathetic attempt to embody his ""Grand Old Boy"" superego like that drunken brother in law, tolerated, but only for your sister's sake. Every five minutes I expected apneatic snoring to interrupt his incessant, rambling narration. I can only conclude that these disturbances were removed in post-production. Too bad -- like drunk uncle Zane passing out in the middle of explaining the whole, damn 9-11 conspiracy, these somnolent interruptions would have provided a blessed intermission during which to run to the other side of the house and hope to god he sleeps it off."
1,"I'm not an expert, but this movie sucks","Seriously, I am an expert, and this movie sucks. But, imagine for a moment--yes, stop and withdraw from your metaphysical prejudices--a movie whose premise is truly profound, strikingly engaging, and culturally challenging--that art is only such relative to those individuals, those `experts', whose tastes, likes and dislikes, decide it so. Given that aesthetic claims are empirically nonsensical--a matter of pure subjective opinion--why is it that some art is valued at all while some not at all? Besides this interesting question, which is put forth explicitly, without the pretentious riddles of terrible poetry, and in about 60 seconds, the rest of the movie is obnoxious editing and narration. Avoid at all costs."
3,A Must for Acadeimic Study,"This book is a must have for academic study as well as clinical practice if you believe in diagnosing and labeling everyone. I certainly do not practice in this way, however this is a good resource to have. Hopefully, at some point we will stop labeling and diagnosing and begin treating the whole person. But, if you want to study psychology you need this book and you need the information in it."
3,Pages are coming loose...,"I purchased this for a diagnostic counseling class in September '06. I use it weekly. Some of the pages are coming loose from the spine. I think this book is too big, and should be in volumes divided into disorders, or something like that. The pages are tissue thin, and we all know that this is a book that will be referred to often in practice. Of course, it is a necessary item in practice, and the information is just as it ought to be. There is a new DSM-V due out next year."
5,Great buy,"This book was as described, there were few markings and it arrived on tme just when I needed it. Thanks."
1,Problem with seller..,"The book sent was not edition advertised and was pretty beat up, some pages were about to fall out. Not to mention seller is scamming, selling books on Amazon they don't actually have and when I ordered my book they found a really cheap version from a random bookstore and had that one shipped to me, pocketing the difference. Sad that this exists on Amazon."
2,BOught this book for class,My oldest daughter had to have this text book for a class in college. She did not like the class but the book was okay for what the subject matter was.
2,sub par,Was touted as new with just shelf ware. Recieved it with water damaged pages and discoloration.Disappointed to say the least.
1,What a book!,"This book is horrid. I highly recommend it . . . to burn. The language was hard to understand and very hard to follow. Although it did have some interesting points. Ok maybe zero. The best part of the whole thing was the end. But wait a minute. I never got that far. The DSM-IV is long and confusing. I found that it did not help me one bit. In fact, it actually made the situation worse. But there's nothing holding you back from reading this sure to be best seller. Go ahead. Waste your money if you so choose."
4,it is what it is,Not sure that my review will influence anyone to buy or not buy this book as it is the bible ... at least until the DSM-V.
5,Textbook,Got it very quickly. This was a textbook that was needed very quickly for school. Glad it got here before my next class started. It took less than a week to recieve.
1,Not Printed by the APA,"This DSM-IV-TR is printed by a company in India, not by the APA. It is printed poorly on cheap paper and is easily discernable from a real DSM once it's in your hands."
5,Wait if you can...,"The DSM 5 is coming out in may of 2013....if you can wait to purchase this then you will want to wait until the new DSM is out.....there are MAJOR CHANGES between the DSM IV TR and the DSM 5. Such as: no multi axial diagnosis....bipolar III, no more aspergers, Suicide Behavior Disorder Specifier, etc."
4,Thorough Breakdown Of Psychological Disorders,"The standard of all psychology books, breaks down the disorders and provides information on how to separate symptoms to correctly diagnose a consumer."
2,Look at the hilarious revisions in the recent issue.,"I don't want to get into a battle here about the credibility of books like this, the ability to look up the complexity of someone's psyche and attribute to them a disease. However, I find it hilarious that all of the recent updates to the text (in this issue) are almost comedic in their specificity----or vagueness. Read the updates here: [...]"
2,"Overrated, overused","There are too many reviews here stating how indispensable or vital the book is without saying why. Mental disorders do not conform to lists of symptoms with ""5 out of the following 8 criteria."" They are far more fluid. There is no discussion of etiology. It is just a check-list of symptoms that is overused by unknowledgeable practitioners who can't do a good diagnosis through observation,history and examination, the courts and jails and especially the insurance companies. A lot of reasonable diagnostic possibilities are omitted due to lobbying by political groups too."
5,DSM IV TR review,"I purchased this book from Australia because it proved to be the best price, even delivered.It is utilised for the diagnosis of clinical disorders and certainly a good reference tool for professionals.I was happy with the product, price and delivery options."
1,Out of Stock,"The book was out of stock after they said I had already paid. They did refund my money, but was disappointed they couldn't tell me before I ordered it."
1,I resent what this implies!,"Wait just a chicken flickin' minute! What is Amazon trying to say about me that this shows up in my Gold Box with the claim that it's been selected ""just for me?"" It doesn't take a detective to figure out what they're seeming to imply, here.Sure, there's probably a good doctoral thesis for someone in many of my issues, but I don't need a big doorstop of a book to self-diagnose actual disorders. Well, more of them, anyway."
2,BIG problem with Glossary!,"The really bad thing about this was that part of the Glossary at the back of the book was missing and part of what was there was actually upside down! The good thing about the book was that who ever owned it before put some really awesome tabs throughout out it so that one can find a specific section quickly. Even with the cool tabs, all of the problems with the Glossary makes using this book EXTREMELY HARD!"
4,Hands-on Learning,What can I say about this book? Great book for school and for learning about disorders. This book is categorized into sections and it makes it a bit more easier to use. Suggested advice: start putting tabs in this book to really make it easy to jump into certain sections. It will save MORE time than simply trying to find a certain disorder or section in the index/table of contents.
4,A mess,When I received this book it was packaged terribly. The ad stated it was a new book but the binding on the book was broken and the pages were falling out. Due to the packaging the corners of the book were damaged and bent. It was an expensive purchase ment for the workplace and it looks terrible and unprofessional.
5,EXTRAORDINARY REFERENCE BOOK,I learned a lot while reviewing this reference book to my class of Clinical Assessment and Diagnosis.
1,Fake Copy,"I purchased the DSM-iv on 8/29/11. It was brought to my attention that my DSM-iv that I purchased through Amazon was a ""fake"". A photo copied boot leg. I am highly disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!The pages are light, smeary.Beware of the letters in the front of the book, it is black and it is supposed to be blue.:("
1,Unauthentic printed copy of actual text,"This is a poor print of the actual text, result of a scan of actual text. Pages are miscut, print not aligned on page, extra ink splotches on about 90% of pages, lower quality of paper than original text, and overall smaller in dimensions likely to save money on reprinting. If none of these traits bother you then have at it because it's a cheap price. If you are looking for a real copy, do not purchase from this seller."
3,A cheap version,"When looking at the DSM-IV book I received, I noticed the book was printed in a smaller format than my classmates and that the printing was crooked on the front. A little disappointed about the fact that I thought I was getting a good quality copy, however the information in it is correct and at least it works."
3,DSM-IV-TR Defective!,"The DSM I ordered from Amazon was defective. The pages are not in numerical order. For example, the personality disorder section is at the very end of the book. Plus, several pages were not completely seperated from each other. I had to use a knife to detach about 30 pages that were joined on the top edge of the book. Overall, not really a big deal but I paid $70 plus and expected the book to be in mint condition."
3,Good value,I purchased an Indian copy which appears to be very inexpensively made with very lightweight paper (like newsprint). It is not very durable but was less expensive than the American copy.
4,It is what it is.,"I don't know what to say about this book other than it is what it is, and it is something I need to enter in to the world of clinical social work."
1,Misrepresented product,"I thought I was purchasing an authentic DSM IV. To my great dismay, this is not an original publication it is a very poorly made photocopied and/or scanned version. I question if this is allowed under copyright laws. Very disappointed with this purchase."
1,never received it...not happy at all cant give a real review of the book,This was my first purchase on amazon (4 weeks ago) and the product never arrived....so this is my last purchase also...Hey Amazon ploease send my book. Funny how they had no trouble processing my payment immediately.I give Amazon two thumbs down!!!!!
2,The binding broke,"Even though book arrived shrink wrapped and quickly, the first time I opened it, pages began to break out of the book's binding. It appeared to have been re-glued at some point. I would not have bought the book if I had known about the binding's condition. It wasn't mentioned in the summary."
5,dsm v,bible of psychiatric illness. always a good reference to havein order to correctly dx your patients. a must have resource.
4,DMS-IV-TR,"I'm a psychology major so this text was a must. The content of the book is great, but the actually book fell apart only after a month or so. I had to go take it to get re-threaded. I recommend the hard cover!"
3,DSM-IV TR,"Disappointed and feel duped. I paid $58 for this book advertised as being ""like new."" Many paragraphs and phrases were underlined in ink, which is distracting to the reader. What are key points to one person, are not necessarily key points to another. Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. But, don't worry, I won't make the same mistake twice."
5,"good price, quick delivery","this was a new book, in wrapper, delivered quickly, and at a great price."
2,"Book should say ""duplicate copy of book"" in description.","This item has the correct information in it but it looks like a copy of the original book. You can tell that some of the pages were copied crooked, and the book does not lay open flat which makes it hard to read."
4,Very good,"There were some pages that were hard to read due to the printing of the book, but most of the book was readable."
4,Must have,It's required to have for school psych. students and practitioners. It's pretty easy to use. Great info.
4,Good,I think this book could be sorted differently but other than that offers great insight and is a great reference tool for anyone going into the Mental Health field.
4,The best we've got ...,"Nothing really new from the DSM - III, and alot of the same problems still exist. Should anxiety disorders be listed as a separate category, or is anxiety inherant in all mental disorders? Are illnesses such as Borderline Personality and Oppositional Defiant disorder too biased toward male or female patients? Who decides whether what number of symptoms need to be present for a specific disorder? The list goes on ...Overall it's a very arbitrative system, but unfortunately it's the best we've got (especially if we want to get paid)."
3,Not for lay readers!,"If you are not a trained professional, you should not buy this book. If not used responsibly by truly qualified psychologists and psychiatrists, the information contained herein can be grossly and dangerously misinterpreted. Do not self-diagnose! Unlike medical dianoses, psychiatric diagnoses are not concrete, specific, and inflexible. Without a contextual understanding of individuals, their backgrounds, etc., psychiatric ""diagnoses"" are meaningless. If you concerned enough to invest the money in this book, your money will be better spent on an initial session of psychotherapy."
2,Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR Fourth Edition (Text Revision),I ordered this book on 09/16/11 and I still have not received the book and I need the book like yesterday.
1,Bad service,"It has been 4 weeks, and I still have not received this book. I have filed a claim, so let's wait and see what happens."
2,Disappointed,My disappointment is about the printing as opposed to the vendor. I was not anticipating a cruddy photocopy with dirty marks inside and the cheapest quality cardboard cover for such a heavy book. The front publication details page has been unceremoniously ripped out of the book and even the front cover hasn't printed properly with the authorship not printing properly! Perhaps a warning note should be given that this is an Indian copy and not an American print run. Full disclosure please. The shipping was fine and item arrived in a timely manner.
4,If you want drama read a Harleqin romance novel...,"The DSM IV-TR, like its predecessors, is not for general public consumption--that is, unless you want to know what your therapist really thinks about you and is telling your insurance company! Or, perhaps, if you get a kick out of thumbing through the Physician's Desk Reference (PDR) on a Saturday night.It should be damn dull and incomprehensible to lay people. Only those of us who've learned to use this manual for satisfying the prying eyes of afore mentioned insurance companies need bother purchasing it and breaking its spine.If you want drama read a Harlequin romance novel."
1,Paid for nothing,"Bought this book listed as a hardcover, paid hardcover price, and received a paperback. This could have been an honest mistake and have been no real problem (could have been listing problems on Amazon)--except I had to pay $16 to insure and ship the book back. For nothing. Wasted money and time, plus some unprofessional attitude when trying to get a refund from seller.Book is in perfect condition, just be aware of what you're buying here.And if you need to, don't expect the proper mailing label or free return shipping--you'll definitely be paying for THAT yourself!)"
1,Not New; Damaged,"I bought this book because I thought it was a good price for a ""new"" DSM. Although specified on the product information, the book is not in fact ""new"". The spine is detaching from the book, and there are obvious signs of attempted repairs since there is different colored adhesive on the outside cover. The inside has creases and has marks as well. Despite being shrink-wrapped, the book had probably already been damaged prior to that. Because of all this, I will be returning the product."
2,"Pages missing, others falling out.","Not sure why this has happened twice with this book (2 different sellers), but pages are falling out in the center & even a few pages are missing. I am attending a class where all the other students do not have a problem with their book."
4,DSM-IV-TR,The DSM-IV is the diagnostic hand book for mental health problems. for profesionals in this field it is a must have.
1,Never got it,"It's been 22 days now and I haven't received it. I'm assuming it's coming from overseas and will be here within the week. If not, I'll have to report this mishappening. Thanks."
1,IT NEVER ARRIVED!,I ordered this item over one month ago and it never arrived. I am infuriated and need it for school.
4,DSM-IV-TR Mamual,"A very good book for social workers to have, for reference to diagnoses mental disorders. Everyone in social work should get this book."
3,Where is this going?,"The most current edition of the APA's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual fails to make any significant theoretical or practical improvement over previous editions. The APA's reliance on a ""medical model"" of diagnosis fails to merge nosology with clinical practice. Although the APA invests significant efforts and finances into creating empirical evidence to support their criteria for diagnosis - if these fail to guide treatment (and they do) of what value are they. An arbirtary diagnostic system, such as this, is just as likely to stigmatize those suffering with a mental disorder and limit treatment options as to aid communication among professionals. To further muddle this process, the APA continues to rely on a rigid categorical system of nosology, retains a primitive view of culture, and provides little direction to explain the value of this lengthy, heavy, and expensive book in the case conceptualization of therapy."
2,Misleading,"I should've known that the price was misleading...this text was the ""Indian"" version...what is that all about? I haven't compared it yet, but it claims to be the same."
4,So fascinating...,"I love this book! Oh, come on. If you aren't a psychologist, I don't know what you're doing even looking at this book. This is of course the ultimate book on diagnostic information for mental disorders, but it's not written to be entertaining. It's written for clinical use. There will be a new one coming out in 2010? I think."
5,A must have for Psychologists and Psychiatrists Professionals or Students,"This is the Bible of Mental Health Professionals and students! So if you are from this area, or thinking of studying any of these two careers, you have to get this book! You will be told to get it either way by your professors, and all you need to know about the different types of disorders and diseases can be found in this book!"
5,"You have to be ""Special"" to enjoy reading something like this.",I'm just kidding of course. My wife needed this to stay current in her training. It is what it is.
5,Great option to rent without buying,"I needed this for work and a class, but didn't want to buy it because there is a new version coming out - it was great to be able to rent it and spend less money and then send it back."
1,Book fell apart,I opened up the manual and the book has fallen apart and about 40 pages completely removed out of it. I am completely unsatisfied.
1,My DSM-IV-TR has Broken-Spine Disorder,"I purchased this from a vendor via Amazon. It was advertised as New, but at substantially lower cost than Amazon. It arrived in new-looking condition. However, within minutes of handling the book, the binding broke and pages are now loose. I see others have this same problem. I also note that on many pages the printing is blurry. I almost wonder whether this is a counterfeit, or printer's error run. Anyhow, the book is unusable and I'm requesting a refund."
1,Never Got Book,Not real impressed with this seller. Never got my book and no email has been returned...?
1,failed to mail,"I am very frustrated with this seller... my book $100 should have been here over 2 weeks ago and I still have not received any feedback from the seller despite my attempts to contact them. This book is essential for my profession and licensure testing, which I have had to postphone until I receive it."
5,Essential,This book is essential for anyone going into clinical psychology. The criteria sets for all psychological disorders are contained in this book and it is needed to make correct psychological diagnoses.
4,"Informative, but don't buy it if you have the original DSM-4","The text-revised version is virtually identical to the 1994 version of the DSM-IV and not worth buying if you have the 1994 version. Along with the DSM-IV, the DSM-IV Text Revised version is, however, an informative book that provides good introductory information, especially in the ""Diagnostic Features"" section, about a wide variety of mental disorders. A problem of the manual, in my opinion, is its use of a categorical classification system while ignoring the dimensional nature of psychological phenomena.Lee J. Markowitz, Department of Psychology, University of Waterloo (Ontario, Canada)"
1,Fake Photocopied Book,"Do not buy this book. Even AFTER I read all the reviews of people saying that their book was fake and photocopied, I still bought it. Big mistake. It was CLEARLY not the REAL DSM. All the pages are dull and photocopied. The words slant and are copied crooked (you think if you were copying it, you would at least photocopy them straight!). The binding is horrible. The pages are stuck together with this thick chalk-looking glue. The glue is so thick that I can't open the book and set it down on the table with out it closing shut by its self. I bought it for my master's class, and everyone next to me can open their book and theirs is nice bright white, and mine can't even open and is dull photocopied white. The only good thing (so far), is that I haven't found any content discrepancies from the original DSM."
3,Had to have for school,"This paperback version is helpful on the wallet, and is what it is. The version five should be out in 2013, so buy accordingly."
5,Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM-IV-TR- Fourth Edition,This book has to be tha main tool for practinioners to learn how to diagnose Mental health clients.
4,Insanity is Insane!,I'm pleased with the product. I was eager to start but I took time to read the materials first; they were simple and easy to understand. The TV commericals are a true depiction of the program. Now I'm in week 4. It's hard but Shaun T keeps you motivated throughout the routine. I sweat a lot and I feel great after each session!
2,Bad discs,I love the insanity workouts. The only problem is that at least three of the discs came damaged and skip constantly.
5,really hard,"This is the hardest workout i have ever done, and I am a dance teacher. I have yet to make it through an entire dvd, but i am on my way. If you are up for the challenge get it!!"
4,Excellent seller,"I purchased Insanity looking for a fast/fun way to become fit. This is definitely the hardest workout I have ever done, but it is worth it. When I purchased the product it was shipped the first day I ordered it and it was received in a timely matter. One of the 10 discs was not working properly, but the seller replaced the broken disc without hesitation. Overall good product and good seller."
2,not for...,"I tried to do this dvd set for about 3 wks.,while it is a good work out some moves r 2 fast & it is definetly not for any one with bad knees like myself! There's a lot of jumping moves that my knees could'nt take. Otherwise it's a great cardio workout, wish i could do it."
5,Great workout!,It's a tough workout for everyone because you challange yourself with how far you push it! I love it! Do it!
5,VERY Intense Workout!,"I am doing this workout 3 days/week and I can feel the soreness (which I love.) It is the most intense workout I have ever done, I have to tone it down a bit a times, but that is easy to do and leaves room for more intensity when I get in better and better shape. I bought a used version and although, there is a dvd in each slot, I am missing one DVD (that is listed on the workout calendar, but I didn't receive it.) That isn't a big issue, this includes many dvd's so I have plenty. I am very happy with this product."
4,This will kick your butt,"Insanity can be very challenging or very easy depending on how serious you take it and how you do the workouts. If you give it your all, you WILL see results within the first 2 weeks or so. I think after a while, however, it gets very repetitive and kind of boring and the effect of Shaun T telling you that ""you can do it"" dwindles.My favorite part about the workout series is the fact that you don't need much space or any equipment. For those of us that live in small confined spaces, I think this is one of the best home workout DVD sets you can buy."
3,Love it,"It's tough but I really liked it. Much cheaper than paying for boot camp classes. Not for the ""i hope to get in shape soon"" person, its for someone who wants to really take it to the next level."
4,Insanity exercise,The product has everything you need and be ready to feel muscles work that you did not know you had before.
4,Awesome workout package,"DVD set arrived sealed and in new condition from The Vidiot. The DVDs were easy to follow; this exercise program is great whether you're looking to get into an exercise routine or just change up your current one. Sean T was a great instructor; he easy to follow and he was encouraging, saying things like ""Just a few more; you're doing this so you can get a hot body"" (my words not his). Each daily exercise differed and sometimes incorporated exercises from other days, but it took some getting used to. After becoming familiar with it, you're pushed to do more reps and be quicker. It's quite demanding, but definitely worth the 60 days of dedication. And it's fun.Only glitch was that a couple of the bonus discs skipped around out of order (negative for manufacturer, not the seller). I think they were programmed incorrectly because it happened in multiple DVD players."
3,Insanity workout DVDs,One DVD is defective. Took 4 weeks after I ordered the second time to receive DVDs.I really like the workouts so far though.
5,Feels great to be insane!!!,Product was exactly what I needed to get back in-shape. It damn sure wasn't easy but it was worth it. Shipping was fast and the product was packaged perfectly and in mint condition
4,Insane workout,Insanity is a great cardio workout. I like that I do not need any weights with it. What I don't like about it is that it gets very repetitive with the moves in the workout.
4,Whatta workout!!,I'm halfway through this 60 day program. It is a blast!!! I'm enjoying pushing myself. It took me a few weeks to realize that I need to modify many of the drills in order to get the most out of it. Give it a try!
2,Not ideal for those with bad knees,"I read all of the reviews and factored in both positive and negatives...then decided to try it for free -I borrowed the DVDs from a Coworker and eased my way into it. Definitely not for beginners (as the infomercial insinuates) and it did get a bit boring. Very hard on knees. I think I'll go back to my X-factor ST DVDs. I must also add that I'm appalled at the amount of people who criticized those reviewers who didn't like the program. What happened to freedom of speech? These reviews are based on people's personal opinions, not facts. You should respect their reviews and they should respect yours. Everyone has a different experience, so let it be."
5,Great for a busy mom! I love it.,"Let's start with this - before having kids I was a gym rat with nothing but time to workout and socialize around the gym. Flash forward 5 years. My youngest is 3.5, I'm 10 pounds heavier then I'd like to be, and just have a hard time working getting to the gym into my schedule, and 40 is just around the corner. Now I do Insanity after the kids go to bed, so late - like 10pm - but I do it! It's hard but the first few dvd's are only 40 minutes give or take and they go really fast. Before I know it there's only 12 minutes left! I'm really, really pleased with the DVD's. I've never stuck to DVD's before but I see no reason I'd bore of these. Shaun T isn't annoying to listen to and the workouts vary. So far I'm very pleased!"
3,Good workout not impressed with company,"Shaun T is good, the workouts are fast paced and for the most part pretty good. Some of the girls are incredibly annoying and the only person who consistently performs the exercises with correct form is Shaun T. My main problem with Beachbody is that they sold me a defective product. I purchase the deluxe edition which had 2 bonus DVDs. However, when I finally played the bonus DVDs it turned out they were completely messed up! It looked like they had been edited by a 5 year old who started at the end of the work out and worked forwards. It makes me think that all of the DVDs are probably edited. I contacted Beachbody to exchange these terribly made DVDs and they wouldn't even stand behind their product to exchange the DVDs for me. What kind of company won't exchange a faulty product? On a whole the product is decent, you can find most of it online for free though, but Beachbody's customer service is inadequate."
4,Great DVD,The DVDs were exactly what I ordered. It was a great product. This is by far the hardest workout I have ever done.
1,TOTAL FAKE!!,I bought this package about a month ago and did the workouts then noticed spelling errors on the workout calender. I thought was odd so I looked up fake insanity on YouTube and the insanity I received was just like the one in the video.
3,Hurt My Knees,"I borrowed Insanity from a friend before buying and am not going to purchase the set. Insanity is definitely for the hard core athlete. I have been running and completed other Beachbody workout routines, so I thought I could handle Insanity. After only 15 minutes of the Cardio Plyo DVD, my knees were damaged. The cardio workouts consist of boring repetitive running in place, jumping jacks, butt kicks, mummy kicks, high knees, that's about all. The abs and arms are push ups, planks, burpees, and ""c-sits"", mixed with some more jumping around. The music is background at best. I also don't recommend trying to do these workouts on carpet.I'm sure, if you can handle the workouts and don't injure yourself, you will see results. If you are into football camp or high-school boys PE class, you may like Insanity. For me, life is too short to hate my workouts."
2,"Good Set, poor quality","This is a great workout set and provides a good cardio workout with lots of variety. There are several DVD's in the package however that were damaged and at least three of them do not work at all. There are others that skip around as well. Also, the set included 2 of the same DVD and was missing another one. I would never buy from this company again and regret my purchase for this reason. I would say about half of this set is not usable. I love the Insanity workouts, they are great. Next time I will buy from a more credible source so that I do not waste my money on poor quality DVD's."
1,Insanity,The workouts are intense and helpful but virtually every DVD is scratched. Nothing is more frustrating than working out and then waiting for the DVD to start working again. Very dissatisfied with this seller.
1,Not satisfied,I Never received it. I was sent the wrong work out videos so I'm not sure about this item. I hear its great but I went thru such a hassle I no longer want to order it again.
1,Bogus,The Video is the REAL Deal if you want a great workout. I believe the one I bought on Amazon was a black market copy...so I returned.
4,"Haven't tried it yet, but looking forward to it",Starting the program on Monday. Have lots of friends who speak highly of it. Looking forward to starting and getting back in shape
2,Good workout product but disks can be defective,"The workout package belies the $150 that was paid but the DVD's can give several players some real trouble. As is happens, the 1 day old top-of-the-line LG DVD/BluRay player would not play the disks without inserting an old movie DVD first otherwise a ""Disk Error"" message would be visible. I tried on another (JVC) player and had a similar problem with pretty much every other disk in the package. I contacted Beach Body on their online chat customer service system and was promised a replacement with an email to confirm the replacement. I never received the email and am now embroiled in back-and-forth game of who to talk to about having this issue resolved. I even pointed their customer service (routed overseas) to their own forum where others discuss this problem. I don't have very high hopes that this will be resolved and the whole kit will be sent back."
3,Disappointed in Insanty,"I did the complete 60 days, and I really enjoyed the workout, although I had to modify for knee pain. This workout did exactly what I wanted...to increase my Cardo, in the process I got tuned abs, thin thighs, and a smaller butt. although my weight loss wasn't much (did need to lose alot) I still followed the insanty's program. What I am disappointed about, I sent in all the requried documents and phots for the tee shirt and NOTHING, it's been two months.... I've come to the conclusion that Insanty only want people that lose 30 plus pounds to falsely show that everyone can lose that much....I was recommending this workout to all my friends and family, but no more... I WANT MY TEE SHIRT!!!!"
2,insanity,The product was suppose to be like new and several of the disc will not play well; movement hangs and moves at 1/2 speed. Not super satisfied. Also note that work out is great for the young but not for anyone that has hip or knee pain; too much jumping. Easy to modify at lower level but would not pay price if one has joint pain.
2,Insanity,I'm highly disappointed because two of the extra DVDs don't work. I was under the impression that like new meant all the DVDs would work.
2,knee problems...,i tried this for the first week aware of the knee issue other people were having being very cautious landing softly...i felt some discomfort but i was still able to do the work outs...i modified a few exercises but in the middle of the second week my right knee started to hurt and had a popping sound so i stopped even thou i can still do the work out and have no problems going up the stairs i dont think its worth risking it...maybe i'll give it a week and start doing this every other day...its weird i feel slimmer in my waist but havent lost any weight i was getting happy cuz i like being at 175 being 5'8... i still dont think this work out is worth the price thou and they should know the knee shouldnt go thru those workouts everyday....even recovery week i saw didnt seem to be much of a break....i did plyometrics from p90x and even added a 20 pound jacket and weighted 190 and didnt have this issue...
2,Damaged dvd,"I love Insanity! However the bonus dvds that came with my purchase:Max Interval Sports Training, Insane Abs and Upper Body Weight Training don't work at all. So be careful if you buy from this person."
2,To Tough on Joints,"So you can push yourself as hard or little as you want with this video. I didn't care for it because I pushed myself and could definately tell that even though I would consider myself in pretty good shape (workout at least 3 times a week), my joints didn't like all the jumping and I could end up hurting myself. I ended up giving this to my brother-in-law who uses it in the winter to stay in shape while running marathons the rest of the year. He doesn't overdo it. I feel that men may like this video more than women."
4,Insanity,It was everything it promised to be. It is a very challenging workout and will definitely work for someone who sticks with it.
3,Crap bonus DVD,"Regular DVDs are perfect, however the ""bonus"" DVDs r homemade cut and copy clips that don't run together. The regulars DVDs are great though and the work out itself is intense!"
3,Insanity review,The workout is great. Excellent for use at home or on a business trip. A few of the DVDs are damaged.
2,workout is good- BUT the dvd I wanted the most is messed up!,"I ordered Insanity to do with one of my friends. And it is HARD. But I love it, and even more- I love how I feel. It's a fantastic workout.That said, I have one major complaint. The insane abs dvd- the one I most wanted/needed doesn't work. It skips all around, it has since the first time I put it in. It's not a scratch, the DVD is just composed wrong. You can't use it. This took me down from 5 stars to 2. As much as I paid for this product, I expected it all to work and didn't try insane abs until the first 30 days were up and it was unreturnable.The workout is great- but check all your dvds or you might be getting ripped off."
2,Great fitness program if you want to get injured,I have been doing P90X for about 2 years now and felt that I was in decent shape at 47 y.o. I started with the Fit Test (day 1) of the Insanity. They show you a few moves you will be doing throughout the program.So Day 2 starts with the Plyo Cardio Circuit. I found that many of the moves were extremely dangerous. I actually slightly pulled a hamstring because there was no stretching at the beginning.I think Insanity is more like the Crossfit where the exercises are violent to the point of injury.The advantage of P90X is that you ALWAYS stretch before exercising.I think Insanity is more for age 30 and under.
5,It works.,"I just completed the sixty days and am very pleased with the results. I have had two angioplasties and was getting overweight by about 15 pounds. My first round was at about 30-40% of what they were doing on the dvd, I hope my second round will be at 40-50%. I should be in very trim shape in 4 more months. One reason I bought the dvds was that the exercises are relatively simple and do not require any equipment."
4,"Tough, efficient workouts with some pros and cons","Pros:I like the all killer, no filler approach to this program. You will work hard in a short period of time and get a good workout. Stick with it and you will improve your core strength and cardiovascular fitness over the course of the program.Cons:There really is no resistance training in this program, so if you are looking to build muscle this isn't the program for you. Many have combined this and P90x into a hybrid to improve cardiovascular fitness and lean muscle development. The workouts can be a bit repetitive and monotonous. Although Shaun T. is a good instructor he isn't as compelling a front man as Tony Horton from P90x. That said, with the intensity of these workouts there isn't much more he can say other than ""push...push...c'mon y'all...push...push...push..."" That gets old after a while. These workouts are tough on the knees and probably best avoided if you have knee issues."
1,"I would love to review this item,","However my I never received it. I ordered it over two weeks ago and no emails indicating the status of my package or anything. I've never had a problem dealing with Amazon before, even when I was deployed my stuff would get there within a week of placing an order!!!! I guess this is what happens when Amazon starts to outsource their operation to small amateurish firms... I want my money back!!!!! Before people start whining about me not reviewing the product, let me initiate the conversation, get a life, I want what I paid for, I didn't receive anything so here is my review on the product!!!! NOTHING!!!!!"
3,Meh,"The dvds come from China and are obviously knock offs (not ""used"" as advertised). But the seller is pretty good about providing a good product. Meaning, a couple of my dvds didn't work and he sent me new copies after I emailed him. Then again...a couple dvd's didn't work. And of the new ones he sent, one still didn't work. The workout was put together in a way where the clips were all out of order. So you can't follow the workout at all. So, overall I would say: good customer service, poor product."
1,PJS 1957,I did not like the fact it is advertised for beginners and when I got the product it repeatedly said not for beginners.
1,Disappointed,"I purchased the dvd and it shipped two days later but took almost 3 weeks to arrive, when it was supposed to be coming from 2 states over. I tried repeatedly to contact the seller with no response. Once the dvds arrived , most would not play in my player and it is obvious they are not original copies. I ordered from this seller because of the high ratings, but it is a joke. My shipment included a coupon for $25 visa if I rated them 5 stars. Don't trust this seller!"
2,Not so good,"I received the DVDs but unfortunately, I could not get any of them to worke. I tried them on 2 different computers and 2 different DVD players. I think the seller will do the right thing and let us return them though."
5,Great Challenge,"I bought this after watching the info-mercial and was very pleased. I wanted to really rev up my work outs and change it out at the same time -- all of these videos do just that. Shaun T. is a great motivator and I am now thoroughly hooked on this series.I was concerned I would not be able to complete any of these videos because I am 48 years old. However, I do work out quite a bit -- I believe that is what allowed me to finish the various DVDs. No matter what your age, if you are looking for motivation and some change-up's with your current routine, I highly recommend this series."
5,It's Insane!,"Watch the info-mertial on TV or go to the web site and watch the short ad. If you want to get in great shape and have no medical problems, then buy this. Lost 8lbs in 4 weeks. It feels like more but that's the inches. They suggest measuring but I didn't bother. It is as hard as they say. But I feel great."
5,this is some crazy program,"Nothing bad to say about this DVD set. It will DEFINITELY get you result if you stick to it. The program itself is fast paced and if you are moderately in shape, this will be a great fitness DVD. However, if you are ex-smoker or current smoker trying to quit while doing the program, your success will not come smoothly; expect some pukage and awkward bodily function might present itself at times, for at least a week or 2. Also this exercise program will need a space where you won't disturb anyone."
5,AMAZINGGG,"I used to run a few times a week and go to the gym, but I never really had the abs or tone that I wanted. I tried this DVD and within a week I could see results. Now I'm almost at 4 weeks and I love it. I can actually say I'm addicted to it. It has made me look completely different and Shaun T is an excellent motivator. DEFINITELY worth the money!!"
5,DIG DEEPER!,"If you throw up, you're doing it right. LOL. AMAZING program! 10 lbs in first 8 days! VERY intense! You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll trim ur back side!"
2,Not my choice,"I'm a 5'11"", 139# female who works out at the gym 5 days a week running, eliptical and weights. I wanted this program as a breakfrom the gym and a way to build up my push up capability, etc. The program is intense and had me sweating, no doubt. However, Istarted to bulk up in a major way in my upper back, arms, thighs, etc. Rather than strengthening and keeping me sleek and tight..I started to get bigger....not my goal! Works well if you want a muscle-bound look but I'll stick with the gym!"
5,Excellent Product,"This program is not easy, but if you put in the work and commit to it, the results are well worth it."
4,works,I purchased this workout in august 2012 and I'm on the second month of the second time around and it has kept me fit and feeling good. At first I thought I was going to try it and quit but I forced myself to do it and I look and feel great at almost 40 yrs. old.
2,First one was scratched,"I bought this for my son. When he got around to the 4th DVD it was scratched and would not play properly. I had order a whole new system and return the other one for credit. I was disappointed to have to pay a ""restocking fee"". Why should I be penalized for their faulty product?"
2,Received couple of defective DVDs,"The service and the quality of the DVDs was great except that the insane abs and max interval sports training DVDs were defective. When I contacted the seller, I got two replacement DVDs but they were defective too. I emailed them about the issue but never heard anything back."
1,VERY BAD ON THE JOINTS,"I am a personal trainer and very fit. This routine is very difficult but I was able to get through it with no breaks but decided to stop doing it because I was waking up with knee joint pain. This workout routine is very bad on your joints. If you are young and can get through this routine, I assure you it will affect your joints...if not immediately, in the future. The body is not meant to do so much pounding, especially the knees. It has been a week since I stopped and I am still having issues with my knees. I love the Beachbody DVD's, especially Chalene's and Tony's DVD's, but am disappointed Beachbody for this routine."
4,Insanity!,Lets just say....I'll be glad when I get myself in shape so that I can begin the Insanity workout again. Had to put it on the shelf til I get in a little better shape but am looking forward to getting back to it.
5,Great,Product got to us in a good timely mater with no damages of the product. We have been very happy with it.
4,Great product,"Intense workout, definitely worth the money! Unlike any other workout I have tried and I am actually tired after I work out."
4,Tough!,Pace is really fast and I got a little turned off the first time I used. I have a healing for from surgery and will give it another crack in Mid Feb once all is healed.
3,This is truly for those who are already in shape,"As they state in the literature and on the video: I only recommend these videos to those of you who are already in shape and are trying to take it to the next level. If you are a regular person who has not exercised or who does little exercise, this is not for you. I tried it with my son and thought my heart would beat out of my chest. My friend threw up while doing it :-) It is extremely tough and major major cardio. The fit people on the video even have to stop sometimes. My son did it and he does great - also likes it. I personally hated it and felt like I was torturing myself. I prefer zumba or the firm videos. Good luck if you try this."
2,Great workout but LOW QUALITY Product!,"The INSANITY workout itself is great. I was disappointed with the overall quality of the set and cd's. The sleeve the cd's came in was already falling apart when I opened it from the mailbox. Most of all, mulitple CD's did not work, including Insane Abs, and they look like they are burned copies, not the real deal. It's like someone printed all the stuff at Kinko's and burned the cd's in there basement..."
4,It actually works,"My husband and I decided to try this workout program after watching his cousin become more toned after doing it. Our only complaint is that the ""Insane Abs"" DVD does not work. Other than that, it's a great program, shipped quickly, and it actually works."
5,GREAT buy,This was probably my best purchase I ever made. On the beach body website it was nearly twice the price...for the same product AND it came with the extra DVD's. Very happy with my purchase!
5,Absolutely LOVE IT,"OMG! This dvd system is kick ASS!!!!!! but its really addictive, it challenges you physically and mentally.if you have the commitment to start, it will make you a believer by day 15. If you dont see a change, then your not doing something right!Excellent Product"
4,Blank DVD,"One of the DVD's has nothing on it. Can we get another DVD? Its for Day 3.So far, this has been a very good work out, we have enjoyed it. However, without the one day we had to skip and move on and we are not sure that was the best thing for us to do.Thank you!"
3,It's okay,"the program itself is great, but 2 of the DVD's don't work from month one which is 3 workouts. people should check the DVD's when they first get them."
4,Totally Insane,"Insanity is unlike any other workout I have ever done before... It was very hard but I really enjoyed it because within two weeks I saw improvement in my endurance level and my body. I ended up with a foot injury and had to stop doing the videos but I look forward to trying this again, now that it won't be to stressful on my body.Was sent with great timing and had all the materials included."
5,Tough,This program is tough. Not for the faint of heart. Be mentally prepared to complete the program. It is very hard.
2,Works only if you are Shaun T!,"I bought this for myself and several of my friends. The program was difficult from the word GO. and though it looked exciting at first... i soon realized how much strain it was putting on my knees, ankles and even my thighs. I exercise regularly and do not have any muscle ache issues but this one left me NOT SORE but actually injured and I just had to stop. anyways my friends stopped this too after a few days because of one reason or another. IN short, buy some other program probably p90X but not this one. you can get seriously injured."
1,Insanity Review,"Most of the things about this product were great. I received it in very quick timing, it was packaged really well, and they even included some laffy taffy with it. However, one of the dvds was defective. It skipped throughout the whole thing and was unusable. I emailed the seller about it and they said they would send me a replacement dvd. I waited a week and hadn't heard anything, so I sent them an email asking if I would be notified when they sent the replacement dvd. They responded with just a period. That's it. So I thought maybe the response was a mistake, so I resent the email. I got the same period. So I'm not sure if I'm going to get my replacement dvd or not, which is a bummer because when you pay almost $100 for something you would hope that the whole thing would work, not just part of it. Great business and package except for this."
5,insanity workout,Insanity is a great work out video but I am a beginner. It is very challenging for me so I have to work at a much slower pace. If you are up for a challenge this is definetly your video...be ready to sweat and loose inches!
5,Shaun T. - Awesome!! - Insantity - Truely Insane!!,"First off, Shaun T. is awesome. Nobody will motivate you better than this guy. Push forward, Dig deeper, You can freakin do it. All month one is doing is getting you ready for month 2. That is where it truely gets insane. Some say this is the hardest workout ever put on dvd. For me, P90x would be harder b/c I'm not the best @ lifting weights. If lifting comes naturally to you, then yes, Insanity might be the hardest workout put on dvd. Keeping in mind that I have not tried the asylum. It's cool to see how far you can push yourself each day.Now, for those of you w/ joint problems, this may worsen them. I was having some problems toward the end. Anyone can argue that Insanity and P90x is just too extreme to do 6 days a week and they would be right. But it's built that way for fast results. Dig deeper and give this a try."
5,Wow...Insane!!!,"I'm only on the 3rd week, but this work out is incredible and extemely intense. I do a lot of cathe workouts and I'm in good shape, but this takes you to the limit. I'm almost in tears by the end of some of the workouts, and I'm gasping for breath! Definitely not for the new exerciser, but it's a great challenge for people that are in great shape!"
5,Excellent High Intensity Aerobic Workout,"High Intensity aerobic workout. Wear good shoes and drink water. If you stick with the program, you are guaranteed results!"
4,It's Insane,If you are willing to work hard and sweat you will see results. I lost 10 pounds in 3 weeks just got into the second set of workouts and it steps you up to a brand new level. The fit tests will keep you motivated doubled most of my scores from the first to the second tests. Shows how quickly you can change and evolve your fitness to the next level. I did give it 4 stars just because it is extremely challenging and would love a next step after the 60 days. Such as a calendar to mix up all of the workouts after the 60 days to keep you going. Or an opportunity to get additional videos once a month to mix into a routine. Totally worth it but you have to be willing to do the work.
5,Amazing workout,"I work out daily and am in relatively good shape. Insanity is the only thing that brought me back to the intensity of high school wrestling practice. I had my metabolism up so high at the end of each session that I would take a cold shower afterwards and get out only to immediately start sweating again. This work out can be for everyone if they modify it to themselves. I know other people who use it and exercise at a lower level of intensity and helps them, but does not get the same results."
3,Fast pace,"I've been using the insanity workouts as cross-training for a few weeks and I must say that, so far, I find the program very challenging. I'm a runner and a cyclist and I have been using the P90X dvds for cross-training for a few years now, so I'm in pretty good shape.The thing that is insane I find is the pace. You go up and down and sometimes it's hard to keep your eyes on the screen. It will take some time to get used to the moves, which seem to be repeated a lot.Now, this program makes me sweat and it is hard to keep up, so I like it but the workouts could be a little longer, if they slowed down the pace a bit. What happens is that once I'm done and catch my breath, I'm ready to go again, so I do a P90X workout or the ab routine. One thing is for sure: this is not the program to start with, if you're not already in good shape."
3,WHEW!!!!,"Let me say this workout is way way over the top for cardio. I agree what Scott wrote about,if you haven't finished P90x don't even bother with this. I have done many cardio dvds before and never had to keep stopping to catch my breath. I even saw some of his people in the video stopping and half doing it. You will have to be in perfect shape for this. I had about 14 minutes left in the video so I stopped. My pulse was beating so fast,and I got worried. Now it's a good video if you have the stamia to keep up. The video does tell you to go your own pace, but oh my, you will still pass out. I call it a quick, fast, stop for 30 seconds and back at it again cardio. They named this dvd with the right title. I probably won't be doing this workout video. I will stick with what's best for my body."
5,Great!,I've lost weight and inches through the first month! I feel like I'm going crazy every time I force myself to exercise. I feel so much better after I do! I love it!
5,No better workout out there,This is the best workout program there is. It will definitely get you in the best shape of your lives. It also comes with a really good nutrition program that will help enhance your results.
5,Great program!,"Shaun T is very motivational and has a good variety of moves so I don't get bored. I also appreciate that no other equipment is required such as hand weights, bands, chairs, etc."
4,Surprisingly Great workout,"This collection is a one of the few TV infomercials for sports related activities that actually lives up to the name. It's very intense. You need a lot of space and you have to purchase some additional items (plyometrics mat, recovery formula), but definitely worth the investment. You'll sweat so much and really tone and define muscles you didn't know you had.The production quality of the videos leaves something to be desired. It's basically an instructor and two other gymers working out on a basketball court. There is a super helpful countdown letting you know how much time you have left for each exercise and it comes with a tracking guide for progress, calendar, nutrition guide, and discs.Due to the 'intensity' of the exercises, it's helpful to watch them all the way through and then do the routine because it's sometimes hard to keep looking up at the TV. Happy working out!"
3,Check all your DVDs immediately,I came across a DVD that was bad in the middle of the program. Because this is through Amazon there is an additional delay in getting a replacement. Hard to do the program while you're waiting on a replacement.
1,Insanity used DVD,The 1st 2 DVD's do not work. I do not have the invoice or I would have tried to send it back. I can't use the start up videos so I have not been able to even use the product. It has been a waste f $90.
2,Lack of Vital information,"What this program does not let buyers know off the bat is that it is really about jumping. Mostly jumping. If you have issues with your knees, or ever had issues with your knees, this is not for you."
5,excellent,"excellent product, if the exercise is done correctly the results are almost immediate. Arrive fast and on time. Good experience."
4,Great cardio work out,"Really good work out and the stronger you get, the harder you can push yourself. The DVDs allow for several breaks to recover then go back at it."
5,wow,amazing! hard as hell but it works. You feel the burn and feel healthy and motivated to do it the next day!
5,perfect!,A new product was shipped free of charge when no used products were available. I am very pleased and will look for this company in the future.
5,Great Workout,"If you are looking for the next way to push your body to your limit, insanity is the thing for you!!! it is explosive, intense and demands mental toughness. Stick to the program and you will know it works.. If you are a begginner, please dont try this at home.. you can injure yourself.. try something lighter until you feel physically ready to commit to this program"
2,Insanity,"I've been following Insanity to the dot. I followed the diet plan and did the workouts every day. I just finished the first week of the second month. I'm pretty active; ran marathons and was in good shape to start off. For the amount of time it takes to do the work outs I have not seen any results what so ever. I still weigh the same. I still look the same and I still do not see any abs. I'm still going to finish the program, just to be sure that I'm giving it the full 60 days;however, so far I have not seen any results."
4,Effective but a little boring,"I'm in my third week of the videos. Overall, I think they're good. Fairly quick workouts (~40min) and am noticing results/gains. My one complaint is that the exercises are extremely repetitive. I can barely tell the difference some of the videos. Aside from that, good product. And honestly, as long as they achieve results...."
4,WOW.,"Shaun T doesn't lie when he says that this is the hardest workout ever out on DVD. I did insanity for 2 months before a cruise and I lost 10 pounds. There were days that I missed and sometimes life just got in the way, but I remained as faithful as I could. You definitely need space for all the moves, and if you have people that live below you, you may want to warn them ahead of time lol. Only one negative about this workout, if you have weak knees, this will make them worst. There's a lot of jumping, and squatting, and your knees are constantly taking a beating. I plan on doing insanity again soon, and am def modifying some moves."
2,Results not worth the (extreme) effort,"I've been working out off & on over the last 10 years.This years plan started with Power90, then INANITY (a new one for me) then P90X. Finished Power90, I was pumped up & looking forward to INSANITY.I don't half-ass my programs & want the best results, so of course I'm eating the right foods in the right amounts, 5 to 6 meals a day plus taking supplements.For me the results weren't worth all the ""Insanely"" hard works. I'll be starting P90X again. I get much better results from that.I think INSANITY may be for people younger & fatter then me."
3,Great for endurance training.,"This will definitely help you build up your endurance and get you in shape. As far as strength training though, you're better off with P90X. I've done both"
3,Insanity Review,"The program itself is great, but the biggest problem is that two disks don't work. My take on this experience is to NEVER order this on Amazon because you cannot get disk replacements. Beachbody will only do this if you ordered directly from the manufacturer."
2,hip injury,"i have hip replacement and ankle broken so i think this is not for me i,m afraid i might get hurt so i think its hard for me"
1,Damaged products,"Two of the discs in this package do not work and it was advertised as ""new"" and the user said they had never used it. I wish people would not sell items that do not work."
1,Good program poor quality dvd,Workout is great when the dvd will play. Tried several of the dvd's in three different players and they will not play smoothly in any of them. Emailed the seller about exchange for new dvd's and get no return email back
1,faulty DVD,"I was disappointed in the Plyomentric DVD that didnt work (bought used from BOOKS FOR EVERYBODY), disk was unreadable in multiple DVD players. The back of the DVD doesnt look scratched so I suspect it was burnt. So far the other DVD's worked but I havent made it through all of them yet. Everything was included in the set but still a let down."
1,Insantiy,I bought the set and only 2 disc out of the 11 would even play. So I was unable to do the work out at all.
2,Bad discs,"I had purchased this product a while ago and did not have a chance to use all of the discs. Today, my sister borrowed a disc to use. She placed it in the dvd player and it did not work, so thinking it might have been the dvd player she placed the disc into her computer. Her computer now does not work because it is completely frozen from the disc and it will not eject from her computer."
2,Poor Quality,"Recieved product in a timely manner, but some of the videos are messed up. some skip around like they were burned and some are scratchy. very disappointed!!!! Trying to save money didn't payoff for me...."
2,"In home, but not mine.","I'm sure it is a great program. I live in a rural area with no gyms nearby. My home is the only option; however, I live in a small farm house with only 8 foot ceilings. Unfortunately, this is totally useless for me because of the jumping involved. I'll be returning it and getting some band aids for my knuckles."
2,Scratched,Only a few of the dvd are working. A lot of them skip during the workout and the rest of them are so scratched that it refuses to play. The product came in time and was wrapped up and everything but I don't know why the alot of the dvds are scratched up.
2,Loved the Workout not the DVDs,"I ordered the Insanity workout DVDs about 6 months ago. I have tried half of them, and they do not work properly. They skip repeatedly, and you cannot properly finish your workout. I contacted the seller this evening. If they respond back to me I will re-rate this purchase. This is the only Amazon.com seller that I have not been 100% satisfied with, and I order from them a frequently."
2,Insanity workout,"the dvd's that do work are fun, but 1/2 the dvd's did not work in any of my dvd players and that is very frustrating when something you buy new and pay a lot of money for doesn't even work."
