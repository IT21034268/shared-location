3,"Ordinary, indeed........","I have mentioned before that a sexy album jacket will sell one album for an artist, but selling more requires substance. I have ALL the records of Carly Simon, Diana Krall, and Bebel Gilberto...I have most all by Leila Josefowicz [WOW], and Sarah Chang {Double WOW}. This is the only Mindy Abair album I have. 'Nuff said?........Miss Abair is, indeed, pretty...she's a fabulous instrumentalist....the vocals could be dispensed with. Maybe if I heard her other albums? She has a fine reputation, and a good-sized following, but I haven't felt myself being pulled back to the record. Sorry. Save your money."
5,explosive,"I think that this album can be judged as a whole more so than most other records, I find it hard to pick a favorite. The album is a journey and it reveals itself more and everytime you listen to the cd. Songs like Ordinary Love and Bloom stand out as up, fun songs and Far Away end the album in a reflective, classical piece. Long Ride Home and True Blue are rockin and her version of It Must Be Love is breathtaking."
1,Too Predictable,"This release is none to different from her previous releases. As with most so called smooth Jazz, I find this release lacking in depth. Her music does not wander too far from what she has established as her comfort zone. In short nothing new. If one goes back to listen to previous releases, one kind of gets the impression he or she has been here before. The music is drab, and lacking in spirit. It is no wonder Jazz is so lacking when it comes to radio stations through out America. This Smooth Jazz genre, has done very little to promate this once great artistic expression, in this modern day. Instrumentally speaking her Sax is asleep at the wheel, and her accompanist, are AWOL. Sax, drums, and bass guitar, cannot, and do not make for Jazz excitement. Listen to some old school (Monk,Coltrane, and Montgomery) Jazz, and compare that music to Smooth Jazz, and then one will get an idea of how poor the representation is today."
2,Commercial elevator music.,"There's nothing in this I'd say even remotely resembles jazz. It's repetitive, has a rock beat, and consists mostly of licks taken from other players. If you're looking for backrgound music to play in a waiting room, this might be a good choice."
3,re: Sounds like a remix of 1 and 2,"I still love the saxaphone, and the way Mindi plays it, but she seems to be hitting a spinning record-player stand still.There is not a single remarkable song on this track, but they are still soothing and fine to listen to after a long day.Her first album, ""It Just happens this Way"", is still her best by far. If you haven't gone out and bought it, buy it now. the Song ""Momo"" really takes me into my dreamworld when I hear it."
3,Her first album is best ....,"Long story short .... there's quite a difference between the two genres of Smooth Jazz and Old School Jazz. A previous reviewer (Book & Music Lover) took the time to scold all of us (indeed chastising all of America's Smooth Jazz radio listeners) on why our genre of choice is petty, but there are a lot of us who prefer this niche community within Jazz. With that being said, this is an album for those Mindi Abair fans who listen to her for her voice (with her sax talents being wonderful accessories). If you prefer Mindi's instrumental sax performance, however, I'm afraid that you'll have to go back to her first album. The choice is yours ...."
4,Damage belt,"Very nice watch, however the belt is worn out before using the watch for less than a year.I surely need to replace the leather beltRegardsOscar"
5,Excellent Watch,"I bought this watch after much research. I have owned it for about 3 months and am very happy with it. It is attractive and classy enough to dress up, yet understated enough to dress down. I wear it almost every day. It contains a quality automatic movement found in watches 5 times this price. This all coming from a quality brand with a long history. If you are looking for a quality everyday watch in this price range (I got it for ~$350 shipped), you absolutely cannot go wrong with this."
5,Another Great One,This book will open your eyes and not to mention your mind. Another great one by Doreen
4,Divine Guidance Review,It is a great book. I was surprised that there were highlighted parts throughout the book. I assumed that very good condition meant that it would look like a new book.
1,What a waste!,"If I could give this book no stars I would. I was never recommended this book, I was just looking for books about angels and bought this book because it looked interesting...I was soooooo wrong! I said a prayer that I found in chapter 3, a prayer that guaranteed results, and I didn't feel a thing. I guess I was rather gullible in believing that it would work.This is my first and last book by this author."
1,"New Age ""Psychobabble""","This book promotes the false ideas that everyone can be a god and that the dead are all-knowing and can communicate with the living. Promotes psychic quackery.The real answers are found through the God of the Bible, the one and only true God. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,child dvd,The dvd was entertaining for my 5 month old & the animation was colorful. I was surprised that it appears to be a British English dvd. The case was very beat up and the dvd itself was very scratched and had small cracks on it; however no problem playing the dvd.
4,First video our 17 month year old interested in,This is the first DVD/video our 17 month year old is interested in. He begs for it. (Our first child liked the Wiggles.)
4,Fun game to take alone for a family vacation,"We collect all kinds of board games. Some are huge with lots of little pieces and easy to get lost so they cannot travel well when we go on vacation. This one is just the right size with all the pieces easy enough to handle even with our two little boys (4 and 2). If you want some variety of the games while you are on vacation at the time share places, but tired of just normal games that are on-site provided by the resorts, this is it to bring!"
3,Nice for the dough,OK quality and certainly better than a piece of rope. I found it a bit uncomfortable for sure but for the money it is worthwhile.
3,Don't expect too much,"I was looking for a wider strap but upon delivery, I found the strap to be 3/4 inches wide. The noted dimensions 2.2 x 8.3 x 1.1 inches must refer to the packaging. The price reflects the value. It is a very simple 3/4 inch wide piece of leather with an attachement string on one end and button holes on the other. It works fine but is nothing spectacular. Free shipping resulted in the package arriving in three days. Great job on fulfillment."
1,Piece of junk,"The ""leather"" flakes of at the slightest touch. Does not have the pattern on it as shown in the photo. Looks and feels very cheap. I do not trust it to hold my mando at all, it will be going in the trash."
1,Not as pictured and described!,"This strap is nothing but a narrow black belt with a shoelace attached. It is less than an inch wide - not two inches. The fancy design in the picture is not there - it is a plain black strap. I contacted D'Addario, the parent company of Planet Waves, indicating that someone else's review used the phrase ""bait and switch"" - the customer service person checked the Amazon listing and said it was someone else's doing, and apparently someone else's problem. In addition, he agreed that ""cradle design"" pertains to a banjo."
3,Not highly recommended,"I found two problems with this album. First, it was recorded in the late '60's, and the sound quality is adequate, but not great. Also, while the Brahms was recorded when duPre was still playing well, you can tell on the Chopin and Franck that she has sadly lost some of her skills. I think you can do better."
3,"Like the Brahms, Avoid the Chopin and Franck","The Chopin and Franck recordings were made while Jacqueline duPre was ill and near the end of her life. As heroic as it may have been to make these recordings in that condition, the quality suffers. The Brahms sonatas are tighter; they have the usual Jacqueline duPre warmth to the sound, and they are much better. If it comes down to buying this album or one with just the Brahms, and there is a price reason to choose the Brahms, I'd pass on this one. But if you can get this compilation for the same price as just the Brahms sonatas, you might as well, unless you don't want any subpar recordings in your collection."
1,did not see any difference,"I bought this for my daughter's toilet. The concept is great, but I didn't see any difference when it came to keeping it cleaner longer. I do not recommend buying."
4,Fluidmaster was exactly what I was looking for,"Fluidmaster was exactly what I was looking for. I love the ease of installation, the cleaning it does in the bowl. Not sure how the refill cartridges will be to find or the expense of replacements. I wish you could open it and install chlorine tablets instead of having to replace the whole thing. This may be expensive and difficult to find."
5,It really works!,"This is one of the very few reviews that I gave five stars. This simple thing really works. As a retired widower living alone, I do all the maintenance and cleaning, so I know exactly how often the toilet needs to be cleaned. I have a brand new Glacier Bay toilet and was frustrated at how badly it stained and how quickly. Installed this in two minutes and what a difference.Update a month later. I am even more pleased after a month. My toilet would begin to stain after three days and be disgusting in a few more. Installed this a month ago, and I stopped cleaning just to see how long it would remain clean. Well, it was quite a while and I began cleaning again just because it was time. But there were no stains at all. Very happy with this product."
2,Dont work....,I don't know if I installed it wrong or maybe my toilet is too stained to be cleaned. But this didn't really help. It doesn't really make my toilet white at all.
2,Didn't work for me,"This might work for some, but it did not help my toilet stay any cleaner.Don't think the product contains enough bleach."
3,A Great Idea,"I like how this works and it seems to do its job - for awhile. Until someone comes out with something better, I shall continue to use it. The drawback is that the cartridges do not last long."
3,Doesn't keep it as clean as you would expect,"I still get rings in my toilet bowl from the funk in the toilet. Using bleach, one would think it would stay clean."
2,NOT for septic systems.,"Maybe these work well with sewer systems, but not with septic systems!Not until you go to the Fluidmaster web site, will you find out this bleach based system, is not recommended for septic systems.Of course I didn't find out until I went to their web site after installing.This is NOT mentioned on the box, or at Amazon."
1,Ehh,Easy enough to install but I didnt think it kept the toilet clean by any means. Still found myself cleaning it once a week at least. Bunk buy.
3,Worked for a month or so...,"It stopped working for me after a couple of months because the bottom of the device blew out. Now, water just shoots out of the cracks that formed at the very bottom. Against my better judgement, I am going to try once more because it was good while it lasted.hopefully I just got a defective unit."
5,Flush N Sparkle system with Bleach cartridges,"I've been using this toilet cleaning system since 2007 and it does a great job of keeping toilets clean. It's easier on toilet tank parts. It may seem pricey, but lasts 3 months and it is well worth it to me for how nice nice it works. (I use only the BLEACH (not blue) cartridges which are harder to find and cost more, but as I said...well worth it to me for how long it lasts."
4,Good Product,"The product works well at preveting mildew, etc. Chlorine tablets seem to work better, but they destroy the toilet! I have had no problem with the tiolet parts using the Fluidmaster bleach product!"
4,In tank bowl cleaner,"I bought this as an alternative to in tank tablets. If you have ever used in tank bleach or blue tablets you know that it decomposes the plastic pipe. This is a new idea, it has a small plastic bowl that the bleach cartridge screws into and hoses to the inlet for the tank. Keeps the bowl clean."
1,Does not work well with Toto toilet,"I own a regular Toto toilet - not any special vacuum flush or anything.This FluidMaster 8300 device installs OK - with some vigorous work with the hoses.But, it's narrower hoses don't allow the bowl to fill up to the normal level. It is about 1 inch lower than normal. That's a lot lower and not acceptable.I bought this unit as the manufacturer's website says ""Fits all brands"". Well, it may fit but it doesn't work right with Toto. Interestingly, their website says it fits all brands but the package says it ""fits most 2-piece toilets"". Hmmmm."
2,"Great Idea, just doesnt last","Following problems with the bits and pieces in our toilet tanks one of the replacement parts had a description of Flush n' Sparkle. Sounds like a great idea. Bought two of them 10 days ago. The one in our ensuite lasted eight days, the powder room one is just about out now. I have e-mailed the manufacturesrs re this, no reply yet."
5,A Product That Works,"Of all of the products that advertise that they clean your toilet when if flushes, this one actually works. I thought that I would try it in one of our bathrooms and see how well it worked. Well I'm here to tell you that after one month of use, I'll be ordering two more for the other bathrooms. And this will even be with the approval of our household product inspector, my wife."
1,doesn't work for my tank!,"The idea sounds great after reading the review, so I made the purchase right away. product arrived very quickly too.BUT, it does not work for my tank! the instruction says the inTube needs to connect to the water source to replace an existing tube in the tank. But in my tank, the water comes from a seconde plastic pipe connected next to the main pipe. The water comes out at the end of the pipe, which is very close to the bottom of the tank. I've tried to stick the inTube into the plastic pipe, with no success. other than that, I find no other place for the inTube to go to. Does anyone else have this problem? I didn't see any review about this problem! This product is useless to me without the water source! Help please."
1,Waste of Time and Money,This product would not work with my toilet. I tried to set it up and only managed to spray my hands with bleach water.
3,"Not bad, but the first one is much better","If you are going to buy any of the DVDs in this series, get the first Sex and Drugs. It seems as if they had a better selection of films in the first."
1,"A good premise, but a bad treatment","I thought I'd love a book which celebrated the role of homemaker. Unfortunately, Mary Pride celebrates only those who subscribe to her narrow and un-Christlike philosophy. Those who agree with her wholeheartedly might find her 'blunt' at times; those who dare to differ with her fallible interpretation of scripture (or who reject her religion altogether) will certainly find her shrill, mean-spirited, and, ultimately, not worth the effort. Borrow a copy first, and if you find yourself in accord with the aptly-named Mary Pride, buy it and enjoy it. If not, you will at least not have wasted your money on vitriolic rantings."
5,"Which translation of de Tocqueville's ""Democracy in America""?","I'd like to learn which translation of Alexis de Tocqueville's ""Democracy in America"" Sarah Pride read in making reference to and commenting upon it in her review of June 1, 2004 entitled: The real story of Mary Pride.I personally cannot rate this item right now, for I have not yet read it, but I'm buying this book largely because of your review, Sarah, which I thought was very helpful.Since I apparently cannot leave the item unrated (for Amazon rejects my review without a rating), I shall rate it positively in anticipation that it will match my evaluation of the other books I've read by Mary Pride."
2,Christian - Hesitate,"Well, I only read 4 chapters and was shortly made aware it was not a book for me. Yes she is adamantly against the ""feminist"" of today, and the book is written in a very factual, hard,point blank way. Not that that necessarily is bad, but one doesn't need to be harsh and graphic to get a point across. It is good factual information, but to many specifics. Yes we need to know the truth, but to what extent? This will be a book liked by many and disliked by some. For women who are very in the firing lines against the feminist movement,etc. this will be right up their alley. For those who want encouragement that they are not ""crazy"" as the world would say, this is probably not the book for them."
5,Life Changing Book,"I first read this book over a decade ago, and it has helped to shape both my marriage and mothering. The author fearlessly attacks the unbiblical but popular views on family planning, marriage, and raising children. I think it is a book that is worth reading for Christians to help us analyze our cultural views of the family, and how they line up with the Bible."
1,"Horrible, judgemental, lacking compassion","I am an ""evangelical Christian"" and full-time homemaker which, I suppose, makes me a member of her target audience. So, the following comments are coming from someone who is in the trenches and understands many of the issues facing Christian homemakers. This book was so full of errors it was pitiful. The author lacks basic skills in Biblical interpretation. She takes verses completely out of context to support her views and gives 'absolutes' in areas that the Bible is flexible or silent. The author comes across as extremely narrow-minded and judgmental. I do not recommend this book to anyone.For a wonderful, inspiring book about homemaking, I recommend, ""The Hidden Art of Homemaking"" by Edith Schaeffer."
3,"works great, but has ink problems","I bought this all-in-one from costco's website. It was a great copier and fax, which was my main concern. I had it about six months before I started having ink problems. I kept getting ink errors, like ""no Cartridge"" even when I had all 4 in there. I called Brother to fix the problem and they told me the black ink cartridge was defective. So I asked them to replace it, and they told me since it had been over 6 mo. it was my problem. I bought another cartridge (not cheap) to replace the defective full black cartridge. I replaced the cartridge and then it told me the blue cartridge was defective, full but defective. So i wasted two full ink cartridges on an error that did not go away. I also found out that the colored ink cartridges cycle, and use ink even if you use the machine for b&w only. Thank goodness for costco's return policy, because I was not stuck with the defective machine. Now I am looking for another one to replace it."
1,don't waste your money,"If you want a printer that makes sense, this is not the printer for you. This printer requires 4 different cartriges and it won't print unless all of them are full of ink. Each cartridge costs about 15.00 and the ink doesn't last that long and they cannot be refilled at the store. My husband I have set our computer to only print out in black ink and for some reason it used up all the other colors... So, now in less than 5 months were supposed to go out to the store and purchase another $60.00 for ink. That's ridiculus, were just going to get another printer. The printer prints when it wants to, we have to keep messing with the printer just to get it to print. I think I'll stick with an HP"
5,Excellent General Overview of Genomics,"I found that ""Genomes"" provides the reader with a thorough yet gentle introduction to the field -- ample illustrations, well-written text, frequent sidebars describing relevant techniques or developments. I've found the book to be a good reference to have on the shelf, and have purchased copies for people when they join my lab group in order to introduce them to or refamiliarize themselves with the technologies underlying the generation of sequence data. I can very easily see this book being used to supplement lectures in an introductory course on genomics and biotechnology."
5,First Edition Valuable Undergrad Molecular Biology text,"Novel approach focused on genomics. Valuable sidebars, and invaluable 32 page glossary.Three years old, not covering new powerful sequencing algorithms, but 2nd edition (due next month) might."
4,The Fidgettes,This game is cool! THe adventurous abilities of these awesome mice is amazing. It has some similarities to Pokemon! I love this game. and the price on Amazon is incredible! I bought 2 for my family! They all loved it!
3,Mouse Review,"In this game you are a mouse and you are traveling to America. You are seperated from your family and must survive. It is very cute and kind of original, but that graphics are not very good. It also gets kind of boring after a while. It reminded me of the movie: Fifel Goes West. In all, cute, but no cigar."
5,AMAZING!,"this item is unbelievable! it actually allows u to take photographs, record things like movie clips etc!it's great and well worth every penny!"
4,Must readi,"Roy and Kevin rip the covers off the beauty queen we call Dallas and expose her ugly scars of racism, bigotry, cronyism, and greed. Those who profess to embrace truth cannot remain sedate and silent after reading the often petrifying story of power. This is must reading for all students and their parents."
3,Game is fun but frustrating because you can't save your game,"This game is a classic Mario game. It is very challenging because every time you lose all your lives, you have to start at the beginning. This gets boring after a while."
4,A Mario that aged...,"This was one of the first games released for the Game Boy. And being that the Game Boy dates back to '89, its understandalbe that the thing you will notice the most is the graphics--they're not good! The tried to make it so it looked like a miniture version of Super Mario Bros., but doesn't exactly look like it. Also there are only 12 levels. That's it! There's still some Mario genius in there, but by the time you notice it, the games over.This is still a decent game and worth the money IF you get it cheap. This is probably one of the few Marios that aged. More like a testament to how far portable gaming has come, than how good this game is, that makes it a classic."
2,This is an OK GAME,"Super marioland is an old mario game. The graphics are OK, but you get sick of playing it. There is no action and you can't save your game. You also have to start over when you die. There is no choosing what to play. You just start at level 1 and go on. I wouldn't recommend this game to real nintendo gamers of the MODERN WORLD."
2,Okay for original,"This game was a fun game at first. I had previously played this game at a friend's house and liked it so much, my parents ordered it for me off this website. This game excited me so much when I beat another level. Then there was the save part. After so much work, this game wouldn't save for you. Very frustrating. Finally, when I got to the final 12th level, the boss Tatanga or whatever was impossible to beat. The music on this game stunk too. The only thing I still like about it is the level/levels where you ride a rock over spikes. The 1st to 11th levels are fun for first tries."
5,GREAT!,"This game is so much fun!The music is great! The gameplay is great! the controlls are great!And, although it would be nice if it could save your progress, it was made in '89."
2,MarioFan(usuallly),"A mario game that you can't save? Both of my kids and I gave up on it. If there's a cheat code out there that lets you save your progress, then I would say buy this game. Otherwise don't even bother."
4,Classic Game,"I've always had fond memories of this game from my childhood, so I decided to purchase it to play again on those long flights home. It's just as I remember. The game is a lot of fun and the music just sticks in your head. The only problem with the game is you can't save."
3,Good for it's time,"This game was the best..............in its time. Now, it dosn't compare to newer games. The graphics, surprisingly, are pretty good. A bad point is you can't save your game and it gets frustrating. Overall, the game isn't very bad, but I'd buy Super Mario Land 2 or Wario Land."
2,No saving?!? 12 levels?!? WHAT HAPPENED HERE?!?,"This game kind of let me down. First of all, the graphics stink, but I don't care that much about that. Second of all, you can't save. Sure, the levels have thrilling challenges, but there's no point to them if every time you get a Game Over, you have to play it all over again. And I was pretty surprised when I found out that this game only had 12 levels. Oh well, it looks like Nintendo shaped up after that though, because I like most of the games that they have out today."
5,yesss!!!,need help keeping the young ones busy without you staying busy? try this game and a hand held gameboy. hurray for mario. he keeps them busy from ages 3 to ages 13! makes you the favorite!
4,"Nice Condition, and it made my son Happy.","Game was in good shape, and it made my son very happy, when he received it. It was over all a good experience. Thank You"
2,Mario is that you?,Very small charcters even for a gameboy game. Only get if you have all the other Mario and Wario gameboy games. This is the first and the worst. Who do you think you are Daisy? You will never be Peach.
2,Could be better!,"The first question I would have for the makers of this game is why can't I save the progress I make? Once you lose all of your lives, you have to start all over at the beginning, which gets extremely tiresome. I had Super Mario Land on my Super Nintendo and loved it so I bought this one, figuring it would be just as good... wrong! I would definitely not recommend this game if you are looking for something challenging and fun. As for me, I have put Mario away and am currently working on Donkey Kong Land, which is much more fun AND it lets you save your game!"
3,It's ok,"This game has 12 levels right? 4 worlds, 3 levels in each one. The bosses are ok too. Fun if you can cheat a bit, like oh my gosh!! Mario is a glove? No a cloud? What can he be? The graphics for that little cheat is sort of screwy. But the submarine, the airplane (are parts of the game), and the music is ok. THe music at the end is what I think better than the gameplay music. But it is sort of funny that Mario says to a fake Daisy for the first 3 levels ""Daisy, oh Daisy"" after she or whatever says ""Thank you Mario"". I can complete the game in 47 minutes anyways, but who cares (cheating)? Still good. B would be turbo/fireball. A is jump (of course). If you do have a gameshark, you can have infinite lives and other codes like I said up above. This game might never be boring for some people."
5,"what a way to start the day, what can i say","play this game right after you wake up and youre guaranteed to hallucinate super mario land throughout the day, and have dreams of it at night. fun game"
4,This Game is Good!,"It's fun, but the graphics aren't too good. It's not as good as the Nintendo 64 version. It's challenging for kids which makes it fun for a long time. I recommend this as a good game."
2,Too short,"I started playing the game and knew right away something was wrong.The graphics were very tiny and hard to cocentrate on.The control was pretty good and the music was awesome. My complaint is that the game is too short! I beat this game in 10minutes! I was really disgusted that I already beat the game.I sold this game to a friend at school and he seems to like it. It has been 4 months and he's only on level four. I onlyrecomend this game to people who stink at video games. They probably finish the game in a couple of years which is the timeit took me to learn how to run a 4 marathons without getting tired. If you're good at video games and you buy this game, I promise you you'll be needing 999 quintillion bottles of maalox."
2,The Reef,"I bought this for my granddaughter. She likes it well enough, but I think the DVD is damaged. She had torn the paper cover it came in, so I don't think I can return it. It has issues playing and will ""pixelate"" as I call it. That's where you can visibly see the ""blocks"" in the screen and it lightly freezes randomly. I'm disappointed with the quality of this movie. I would use ""buyer beware"" when buying from this seller."
1,What a terrible movie.,"This move was a present for my 3 year old, and to be honest, he likes it. However, I would recommend that no one else waste any money on this piece of garbage. The animation is awful, the story is horrible, and the acting is terrible. There are many other good movies out there worth spending your money on."
1,i hate it,"the movie was a really bad qualitly, was way to a short movie and we didnt enjoy it at all"
1,Annoying little movie,"I didn't like anything about this movie. There are no endearing characters and you have to listen to some ugly voices, (Fran Drescher). It's a pathetic knock-off of Nemo and Shark Tales with very poor animation. And, I can't help it but I hate that turtle."
5,Buzz Will Protect Your Room,I got this buzz lightyear room guard when I was 4 years old now I am 10 years old.I clened my buzz lightyear room guard so it is nice and clean but his front helmet is missing and his stickers came off but I don't need the stickers all I need is the helmet and it is clen condition.I read reviews about this buzz it says that it can be removed from the stand but my mom would not let me because it might be ruined but it is okay thats how it is.The retractable wings stay on and is activated by the red button not by itself.The batteries are still working and I like the over 35 phrases because this buzz lightyear is my favorite toy still this is a cool toy.
3,"Cool toy for kids, headache for the parents","I bought it for my 1.5 year old who is fascinated by the Toy Story movie. It looks just like the movie character! It's a bit too heavy though to carry around (perhaps my son is a bit young for it). Also there is no switch button, so when the Buzz starts shouting out his commands and warnings (believe me he is VERY loud), I wish I never bought this toy. It does not really teach my son anything - that is why I didn't rate the educational value of it very high."
1,Read CAREFULLY These are I3 Diamonds!,"I3 is a category of diamond that in the past would only have been used for industrial diamonds. (e.g. they would be ground up and used to make saw blades) However because of the demand for cheap diamonds, I3 diamonds are now being cut and used in jewelry. This is why the prices for certain types of diamond jewelry have become incredibly cheap.Diamonds are graded as follows: FL, IF, VVS1, VVS2, VS1, VS2, SI1, SI2, I1, I2, I3The grading description for I3 is as follows: ""I3 diamonds have large and extremely easy to see inclusions that typically impact the brilliance of the diamond, as well as having inclusions that are often likely to threaten the structure of the diamond.""I am all for look over perfection, but I would think twice before buying a diamond graded below SI2, unless this is for your young daughter who might lose them somewhere..."
2,Didn't expect much and got less,I knew that I was ordering poor quality diamonds and that is what I got. They don't sparkle and you can't even tell they are diamonds. They look like white rocks. I was misled by other customers' positive reviews.
1,Not happy,These earrings made me very unhappy when they arrived in the mail. I bought them for my wife as a christmas gift and I couldn't bear the thought of giving them to her. I was very disappointed by the discoloring of the diamonds!
2,Small...Tiny...very!,"This is the first time I've purchased jewelry from Amazon, and it didn't go very well.The earrings were very very very, let me say, very small. They were so small, that one was wrapped in tissue and I thought it was just shipping packaging and almost threw it out.The picture they have for this item, should seriously be removed and updated with a more accurate photo, that show's the true size. These were less then 1/4 of an inch in size.- I just wanted to come back with an update... On 12/21, I went shopping in the stores and was able to get 1/4 carat ear rings that were much much much, nicer and BIGGER then this product for much CHEAPER. This product is a complete rip off and should be removed from Amazon!"
1,Disappointed,"Bought these for my wife, half of the reviews here were good, so I thought maybe the other reviewers were just too picky. Unfortunately, had to mail these earrings back as soon as I got them. They looked terrible! I would never give them to my wife. The diamonds weren't clear at all, they looked white. I knew what I was buying - small cheap earrings with low grade diamonds - so I wasn't expecting too much. But these earrings were just unacceptable! I've seen jewelry with diamonds of the same grade before, and they weren't nearly as bad as these."
2,just ok,I really didn't expect much out of these considering the grade and quality. I bought them for my second earring holes. I must say that I have only worn them once.
1,Don't waste your money,"I got these earrings as a gift and OMG..... there are HORRIBLE quality. They are dark with carbon and don't sparkle AT ALL. I actually cryed when I opened the present and saw them. If you have to give these as a gift, do not waste your money. Your GF or wife will not be happy if she knows anything at all about jewelery. I would rather get nothing at all then get these earrings. I wouldn't even show them to friends and family because I felt like my BF didn't care enough about me to get me something of quality."
2,Earrings don't look like the picture,I was very disappointed in these earrings. I was really conflicted whether to get them or not after reading the reviews. They are not sparkly like the picture shows. They are more milky and not shiny at all. I say don't waste your money!
2,Not worth it at all,"Very poor for the money.. one was great looking and the other was so cloudy that you could not even tell it was a diamond. I do love Amazon though, I shipped it back and they have the best return and refund time."
2,Bad quality,"What i got is really bad service and bad quality. The product quality that I got is much different from what shown in the picture. Second thing is, I bought a pair of this and each of them are in different size. One is smaller than the other. I planned to give this as a gift. But after such a long wait and by seeing this, feel so upset about it."
2,Don't buy diamonds off the internet,"My dear husband bought me these diamond earrings for xmas to replace one from a set that he'd bought me a few years ago that I'd lost. He's usually a very savvy consumer so I'm shocked he would buy diamonds off the internet. They're not terrible, and if you're one of those guys who just want to buy ""any old"" diamonds for your girl, they'll probably work. But diamonds are really something that should be purchased in person where you can inspect them yourself for clarity & quality. The ones I got were a little cloudy and unimpressive. But I kept them because I didn't want to hurt my husbands feelings. BUT...PLEASE, gentelmen, go to a jewelry store and look at the diamonds if you're buying them for a lady!"
1,Crystal Clear These Are Not,"Caveat Emptor: Let the buyer beware! Do not let the mock-up images fool you. When this item arrived, I was startled by the complete disconnect between the actual product and the product picture.Being a confessedly nave purchaser, I did not consult an independent jewelry resource to clarify what the technical description of this product was. I went by the image, and boy was I surprised! These jewels have coal specs so large that you wonder whether it can legitimately be called a diamond earring! The cut, additionally, is not accurately represented in the images. You'll find that the gold mount is dramatically larger than the product image would lead you to believe, and the diamond's cut is not as attractive or complex.Overall, a deeply dissatisfying purchase."
2,much smaller than expected,"I didn't expect much, considering price, for the diamond. However, it was very poor quality and the setting was so tiny I could hardly get hold of it to put in ear. I returned it."
4,great little diamonds for the price,"I bought these to wear in my second holes. I had lost the earrings I had bought many years ago for over $300, and thought I would give these a try. They are very pretty and sparkly, and if there are any imperfections I did not notice. These are small, but a good deal. Nice and shiny too. I would definitely recommend these to someone who is looking for a small pair of diamond studs for a good price."
3,first diamond studs,"These earrings are nice, I have $50 in gift receipts and this was on sale for $110, so for $60 is good, but not $110. They are not the clearest diamond, but they are still nice."
3,Scared Straight!(1978),"Saw it couple years ago, we need not just stuff like this but more stiffer sentences and less recreation in prisons to make sure convicts aren't living in a club fed."
1,Proven to be harmful - increases kids chances to end up in prison.,"This program was an utter failure. Peer reviewed research shows this program to increase likelihood of kids ending up in prison. Who would have thought that screaming at an already troubled kid, threatening him or her with rape and murder would have a negative effect? A&E has made the horrible, mind bendingly stupid decision to make a series about this abomination of a program (or programs like it). Disgraceful."
2,Bored Straight,"This is NOT what I expected. I thought this was going to be a ""documentary"". I thought this was going to show the kids being booked, wearing the prison uniforms, eating with the inmates, going to the yard, and then being locked in their cells. None of that happened.Instead, this entire film was shot in one room, with the kids in a big circle, and the inmates or (lifers), lecturing and yelling in their faces, about getting raped, shanked, and beaten to death in prison.This is a good educational film to show at special schools for troubled youth. Or the Y.M.C.A..This is not a movie to watch for fun or entertainment."
4,Learning from others' mistakes,"I viewed this video before watching it with my teenaged son. It allowed us to discuss the reality of accountability for one's actions. The language is crude; however, real. The situation is still relevant. The ""20 years later"" portion of the video is priceless."
5,Improve Your Skiing - Read This Book,"This book was written in 1993 (it is now almost 2000) and you may be tempted to think that this book is outdated. You couldn't be more wrong! Everything in this book is as relevant, if not more so, that when it was written.The section on canting and alignment is amazing. On first reading I was sceptical. However, I have recently been correctly canted and aligned and am amazed at the difference. As an instructor and racer, I work a lot on my skiing technique. Being correctly aligned has shown the biggest single improvement in my skiing for years.The techniques discussed in this book are also very very good. Most of them are now more relevant than when the book was written as they allow you to get the most out of the new generation of carving skis.Buy this book, read it, read it again, be aligned and then ski better than ever."
4,Learning to ski,What can I say that the book doesn't already say. A great book for beginning to intermediate skiers. Including several sections covering your equipment and proper fitting techniques.
3,Presents each child's own story,"This book has places to add pictures and details to tell your child's own story. My daugther, nearly two, enjoys looking at pictures of herself, her Mommy and Daddy, and her birthparents as I read to her about her adoption. The only negative thing, in my opinion, is that the colors and animated characters are dull. It needed a lot of stickers, pictures and drawings to make it more interesting for our daughter."
5,Great for cats too!,"I don't know what it is about these mini tennis balls, but they are the only ball toy (aside from croquet balls) that my cat will have anything to do with. He refuses to chase or carry the plastic or sponge balls that Petco usually supplies for kitties. If your cat has playful dog-like tendencies like mine does, these toys are a real winner!"
5,Citizen Eco-Drive Women's Lucca Diamond Accented Watch,"I have been very pleased with this watch.So Far, it has kept perfect time. It is a beautiful watch and the price was very reasonable. It is everything it was presented to be."
2,cheap looking,"Bought it for my wife for our anniversary. Shocked to see the diamond bezel was nothing like in the picture on web. I guess I was fooled by somany good reviews. The diamond are realy diamond dust, not stones, that gives an overall cheap look to an almost $300 watch. The two tone is not appealing at all. Over all very dull looking mediocre watch. Might return for something else."
4,Women's Citizen Two-Tone Diamond Watch,My wife is pleased with the watch. The purchase went smoothly and the watch was delivered in a reasonable time.
4,Solid information for creating a good Web page,"Creating your own web page can be as easy or as complicated as you make it. Even the simplest page can benefit from a solid understanding of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), the system of marking a document so that web browsers will present it well. My preference is a bare-bones approach, with few graphics and simpleformatting. Even so, this book helped me make big improvements in theappearance of my pages. Someone putting together a fancier page willbenefit even more. If you are new to HTML, this book will introduce you to the basics and show you exactly how to create a professional-looking page. If you are already familiar with HTML, it provides good suggestions for making your page look better, and is a useful reference. If you are a maniac, never mind"
5,The change in Andy.,"Jungle Rules arrived a few days ago. I was in the middle of reading, ""Breaking the Spell"" by Dennett a professor of philosophy and cognitive studies at Tufts. An interesting read but heavy at times. While reading a particularly convoluted argument I decided to put down that book and for a change of pace read at least the first chapter of Gaz's book.I found the book so good I couldn't put it down. What a story. Through Andy, Gaz describes a war, personal anxieties, behavior under stress, a country, leadership styles, in fact pretty much most facets of life.It is a great story about the transition in Andy. Movies have exhausted the Viet Nam war, but this book should be a movie. The story is just as applicable today. I bet there are hundreds of Andys in Afghanistan and Iraq.Looking forward to the sequel."
5,Saving Money,"Digital cameras cost hundreds of dollars not this one ... I mean it might not have the best graphics and its not in color, but take my word for it you'll spend hours creating extreamly funny pictures you can evean print them out with the printer but thats another story if you always wanted a digital camera I strongly sugest this one............"
5,THIS IS THE COOLEST!,"This is one of the coolest if not the coolest thing for gameboy camera ever made! You can take pictures, mess them up, keep them in an electronic photo albam, send the pictures, (via another gameboy with the game link cable) and play mini-games with you or a friends head on players body and much, much more!!!! The only problem is that you can only store 30 pictures at a time. And, you don't even need the gameboy printer, you can just look at them on the gameboy! And the swiveling eye enables you to take pictures of something in front of you or something in back of you! So in conclusion, this is the COOLEST! If I had to rate this from 1 to 10, I'd give it a 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000! PS, the pictures aren't in color."
4,Interesting Buy!,"I used to have one of these when I was about 10. I'm 16 now. But, my point is that it's really cool you can take pictures with your Gameboy Color or Gameboy Advance.The downsides are that there is no flash on the camera, and the pictures aren't in color. Plus, it's not really an actual game, so young players might get bored easily with it.The camera is cool; it can swivel around. The downside about that is that young players might accidently twist it off completely, or just damage it out of frustration.The lens can be cleaned with eyeglass cleaner and a soft cloth, preferably the kind you get with your glasses at the eye doctor's office.A young kid could poke a pencil inside and penetrate the lens.My final thought is that is very interesting, very fun, but I would not recommend you to buy this for children under the ages of 8."
2,Not very good,"I was not impressed with this camera for my kids. The resolution is not very good at all, but what can you expect with a childs toy. My kids did print there pictures with the little printer they have but they didn't turn out that well either. Just get a small digital camera for 20 bucks. It is a better deal.Tammbowww.tamberts.com"
4,Nice complete package,"Only problem is that if you are using a usb to ps2 adapter you will have trouble getting them all to plug in one beside the otherIf they had made it and 1/4"" wider with just 1/8"" more from the video to the mouse and 1/8"" from the video to the keyboard This product would rate a 5 Star"
2,"small wonder, just don't take pictures in the dark!","This was a nice camera until it broke after 2 good years of service.PROS:1) lightweight, small, simple, fast, a good all-time companion2) beautifully looking3) excelent color accuracy4) sharp, low-noised images5) low priceCONS:1) no image stabilizer makes taking night pictures a really pain2) slightly dark picturesThe lack of an image stabilizer is a serious problem in my opiniion, as people buy these cameras for personal, indoor, use. If you can't take pictures in dim light (a fancy restaurant or a party), half the fun is cut off..."
2,Not a good representation of the phases,"Even my young daughter noticed that the moon doesn't look like this on different nights. (The way they put it together was more of a representation of how it emerges from an eclipse...) She said ""it doesn't change like that!"""
2,ultimate?,"although the line-up here contains all very tasty tunes, i'd find it hard to call a dave mason compilation 'ultimate' if it lacks both ""pearly queen"" & ""all along the watchtower"". tasty? yes. ultimate? no. if you want an overview of masons career, be a sport about it & pick up a couple early discs (""alone together"" is a must) & maybe get ""certified live"". if you like that, then pick up some others. this collection (""ultimate"") is a 'shotgun' approach - dave masons music deserves better.peace out - space puppy"
4,Intense family history,"This DVD features interviews with Ellroy about the unsolved case of his mother's murder, the centrepiece of which is a gathering of Ellroy with a large group of LA detectives who had worked on his mother's case or other homicides in LA over the years. Discussed at the table, as Nick Nolte (for some reason) wanders into the room, is the Black Dahlia case that had fascinated Ellroy as much as his mother's had for decades. One person at the table had used his own money to investigate the case and come up with what Ellroy calls the most plausible theory about the murderer's identity that he had ever come across. Who, in other words, would have had both the extreme dementia and the medical knowledge required to do what was done to Elizabeth Short on that day in January 1947. The film is a glimpse into the noir world of Ellroy, and it is fascinating seeing firsthand what an intense fellow he is, as well as his wife. I just wonder why he hates Bill Clinton so much?"
4,wing gundam,the wing gundam model kit has one flaw the sheld falls off but it has convinced me to buy me another one
3,good but not better then the origenal east side storys set,the sound is 100% better but this new and inproved set is missing about 12 songs from the origenal set that came out years ago like vol. 8 is got 12 songs but 3 are replacements of songs thay could not remake. but in still think the set is great.
2,"graphics are awesome, gameplay suks","mlb 2k5 is a game for anyone who cares only about graphics. I dont care what any other reviews say, you gotta believe mine!when i first bought it, i expected it to be much like last years versoin, but with all the improvements needed. i was amazed at the superior graphics. every detail was put in, it was amazing. then i started playing.everything suked. it was impossible to hit, let alone get homers. the pitching was alright, but i prefer it in MVP any day. baserunning is so confusing and theres nothing explaining it well in the manual. also it has lots of pointless extrtas like In-your-face baseball and the skybox. it just wastes memory. trust me, it is advertised really well but they only trick you. dont be the next person to fall for it. go with MVP baseball 2005. its a little more pricy, but its so worth it!"
1,MVP Baseball is so much better then this game.,I fell for the hype and got this game . My son hated it. We got the MVP 2005 Baseball game from Ea Sports.
3,would be great if...,"This game has the better gameplay between this an MVP, but they need to fix the glitches. Just having this for a day, I have already noticed in Franchise mode closing pitchers do not get recorded saves. This gets really REALLY annoying. Anyone else notice this? If the glitches are fixed with a patch like in the past this game will be the best."
3,MVP is better,"MLB 2k5 is a big disappointment. the faces are bad in this game, bad! triple play 2002 had better player faces than 2k5.game play also is worse than from 2k4. 2k4 was easy to play, and 2k5 they got very complicated. you have to use so many buttons and do so many things just to run the bases.on the upside, the crowd is awesome. the stadium music, the piano is awesome, and the graphics are amazing. they also captured the true dark blue of the atlanta braves, which MVP failed to do, but that's about all. what i also like is the weather factor. you can put it cloudy, cold, day and warm, twilight or nighttime.in MLB 2K5 the batting stances are to generic and fake, too glitchy. it's not smooth like MVP.the biggest difference between MVP and 2K5 is smoothness and realism of the game, which MVP nicely accomplishes."
3,"Graphics are awesome, game sux","this game is the follow up to one of the best selling baseball games of 2004. its advertised well, but thats it. you get the game hoping to see all the previous years' errors fixed plus some new features. it has some of the greatest graphics i have seen in my life, but the gameplay lets u down. it is very hard and complicated, plus there are some really strange errors like you dive and the ball just sort of magically appears in your glove, evn if you werent going to catch it. trust me, rent it if u want, but buy MVP baseball 2005, its much better!"
4,ok,it is not good its just ok the graphics are 3 out of 5 somtimes its really hard its not my favorite game for sure its good game but you know not the best but good
2,Shipping Gouging,"Pay attention to the shipping cost for this product. It is 'shipping gouging' at it's finest. Why pay TWICE as much for shipping as you paid for the actual product? Nonsense! You'd be better off snipping a neck hole in a sturdy plastic garbage bag (lawn and leaf bags work great!) and saving yourself the thirteen dollars. This cape was NOT worth the 'bargain' price, in my opinion."
1,Poor quality,The front zipper broke on the first use. The stitching on several of the corner loops let loose. I returned it.
3,close to you,La verdad que este album me parece algo falto de instrumentacion por lo que creo que pudo ser mejor
5,Junji Ito is a master.,"This is one of the best horor manga out there, it was recomended to me by Alex Grey, and through him Adam Jones, so if you like to swing on a spiral, this is the comic for you."
4,Epic.,Think twilight zone plus death note! I loved this novel and have the other 2 coming in the mail. The only thing that I did not like about this was how straight forward everything felt but I have a feeling this story will end epically. I guess I will have to wait and see but this book is great and if you like Manga.. this book is awesome.
4,Brilliant horror series,Brilliant b&w art with plenty of fine detail combined with a moody and haunting storyline makes this one a standout and serves as a great introduction to the Horror brilliance of Junji Ito. Really looking forward to reading the other 2 books in the series.
3,"Great, informative book, except for the torn pages.","When it came to us, the book seems fine. However after only 2 days the middle section of the book starts wearing out and eventually I'm bringing a ton of loose papers to class. I don't mind old books, but would like it to at least be mended (or glued) before it arrives to us"
3,If you like Pam you might like this,Its pretty corny but fun to watch if you like Pam Anderson. From what I have heard she had the idea of making a series of making fun of herself. After an episode or two you understand you can't be serious. Its not realistic or serious just fun to watch.
4,Nice,"When Spencer Kasimmir Is Said To Collect Rocks, It Was Fine For Him. But He Knocks A Grave And A Spirit Comes Out. Now It Wants to Take Over His Body. I Think This Is The Best Book Of R.L. Stine. I Also Have Reviewed Headless Halloween. I also Have Return To Ghost Camp, Earth Geeks Must Go, Are You Terrified Yet? , I Am Your Evil Twin, Cry Of The Cat, Bride Of The Living Dummy, Fright Camp, The Mummy Walks, The Werewolf In The Living Room, Be Afraid Be Very Afraid And Full Moon Fever. I Really Like Attack Of The Graveyard Ghouls. I Always read Goosebumps At Night."
4,"They'll Get You. You can run, but you can't Hide.","Things were going just fine for Spencer Kassimir until he knocked over that stone in the graveyard. And now, things are starting to get a little scarier. For one, he's not in his own body anymore..."
4,COOL SHAPE CHANGING BOOK,"I LOVED THIS BOOK!! This was the first 2000 series book I read. And now it inspired me to read more. So far I read 14,15 when I'm done with Return To Horrorland!! R.L.Stine really did it this time!!"
5,Attack of the graveyard ghouls,This book is the best R.L.STINE book I have ever read it is a about a boy who knocks over a gravestone and wakes up areally bad spirit who wants to take over his body.
5,Very complete step-by-step instructions on Porcupine spankin,"Porcupine spanking, though very challenging for the amature, is carefully shown in an invigorating and compleat manner in this guide that everyone needs to own"
1,Would not buy this brand again,I thought these nuts tasted very stale. They were not the tasty at all.I cannot believe this product sold for such a high price. Very disappointed.
2,Why only 33 things?,"OK, I read this book, and I fall out of the line of happy, snappy reviews. But, here are some of my problems with the book. First of all, stop with the alternative layout already! It's distracting, annoying, and detracts from the important content. I guess it's got many font heads etc to appeal to teens, but frankly I think it misses its mark. Also, I thought the book could have given more to Phyllis Wheatley than one line in a poem! There are also a number of other important female thinkers left out of this book such as Adrianne Rich, but Blondie makes it into the book. I guess if you only are going to put in 33 items, somethings gotta go! So cut Blondie. Some of the poetry choices that are toenhance the nonfiction text were disappointing, or weak. I think that the editor could have done a better job to flesh outthat part of the book, because I like the idea of using poemswith nonfiction. So, with that, I do not recommend you buy this scrap book version of women's history."
5,awsome game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is a really good game especialy if you are a mustang fan.It includes the new 2005 model.you can choose your amount of cars you want to race.Some of the cars are really easy to unlock.Most of the tracks are sweet!!!!!!!The cars go really fast (Mustangs & Ford gt).This game was so awsome I want to Get the 3rd one.
2,Ford lovers beware,"Let me start by saying I love Ford and have owned a Ford ever since I could drive (15 yrs ago). So I thought this game would be perfect for me; however, I was terribly wrong. I love the cars, but the game itself is very boring. Some of the challenges will just aggravate you. Others are too easy. The dirt tracks with the FX4 were fun though.Graphics: Comparable to a PS1 game.Control: Not very responsive.Music: Could have been better.Choice of cars: Excellent.Fun factor: Not there.Overall: If you are a Ford fan, buy it just to add it to your collection of Ford memorabilia especially since you can get it cheap. The dirt tracks are fun, but it just lacks the sense of speed you would expect when playing a game of this nature."
2,What a shame,I'm surprised people like this game. Besides getting to drive unique and cool cars (I especially like the early 70's mustangs) this game has little to offer. First and most importantly it's extremely boring. The graphics are mediocre the music is horrible it generally feels thrown together. I love ford but this is lame.
5,Will Kimbrough - This - a fantastic CD,"I was lucky enough to see Will perform at Davey's Uptown in Kansas City, Missouri, on August 22, 2002. The music was absolutely fantastic! It amazes me that Will does not get more airplay - but I guess that is just a statement about the quality of music today. Will's music blends many different styles (country, blues, rockabilly, etc.) that will appeal to almost anyone. I also enjoy the personal feeling that Will gives to his songs. ""Chimayo"" is my favorite cut and, to me, worth the price of the whole album. After seeing him live, I have a new appreciation for the guitar. Will was fascinating to watch as he played song after song - his talents are remarkable. All I can say is check this CD out - you will not be disappointed!"
1,Terrible,"Terrible Game, I bought this as a kid thinking it would be just as good as the SNES one, boy was I fooled. Just get the SNES one"
5,Great representation of Aleppian classical music,I was enchanted and rejuvenated by this production. Most notable is the attention to authenticity and fedility to the heritage without immersing in commercialism of pop music of recent times in the middle east. I hope the group would publish more and would follow a systematic way of archiving their work to represent the rich musical heritage of Aleppo.
3,Creepy as the title,"I thought this book, well, downright creepy. I mean- Shadow Club Rising. Already sounds creepy. But the story just backs it up. I can't believe the cruel and sick things that those kids do to eachother. To heavily dislike someone because they're better than you and to keep it to yourself is ok.... but hating someone so much that you could seriously hurt them and not care... just because they're better than you.it's wrong. i think that if this is really what kids are like today, than our earth has no future."
5,Excellent snow shovel,"Has to be one of the best, if not the best, snow shovels made. Poly blade is perfect size for almost all snow types, even the heavy wet stuff. Steel wear strip is a real plus. It is a poly blade, tho, so do NOT use for chipping ice or banging on pavement as the blade will fracture."
4,One of my new favorite authors,"Christopher Brookmyre is a recent discovery for me--and his Jack Parlabane books (I've now read two) are great. Good suspense, well drawn characters and continuity from one book to another. Because he's a reporter, he can do things the police (polis) aren't allowed to do--and he does those things with style. I've now read all Brookmyre's books--and it's time for him to write another."
4,Funny and Crude,"Funny, crude, over the top, entertaining, are some of the first thoughts that popped in my head after finishing this debut novel.Endless greed and pathological selfishness of the New Era capitalists. And there comes stubborn and brave investigative reporter Jack Parlabane and risks his life to expose the culprits and while he is at it, solve a murder.Its a fast paced, modern mystery that pulls no punches. It entertains us successfully but quickly fades away from our minds."
1,Quite Ugly...,Haven't read this one yet. I'll review after I see what it's all about. I bought it to read on my iPad and I am behind on eBooks.
4,it was a good read,good characters good story. The main character was different and enjoyable. It was entertaining and fast paced. Nothing spectacular but was a good read.
1,Closed book after the first word of the first chapter and did not read it.,"Closed book after first word of the first chapter. I could not get past the first word, I guess there are people who talk like that, but I found it offensive."
2,Nothing to get excited about.,"This book came highly recommended, but left me disappointed. Similar crude style as Irvine Welsh, but lacked depth in the story. Mildly entertaining and good fun I suppose, but nothing to get excited about."
2,Acceptablle for $2.99 but glad I did not pay a Dollar more,Not as funny and witty as the first few pages promised. After all a slightly above average crime novel. No surprising turns in the story and for my taste too many different view points.
2,Quite Ugly One Morning,Christopher Brookmyre created a great title but his plot development was predictable. Book not challenging to the mind or the imagination.
3,Promise unfulfilled,"The book had promise, dialogue at times was interesting, scene setting was occasionally adequate but for the most part the book did not deliver that promise."
3,"FUNNY, CRUDE, OVER THE TOP, FAST PACE.","Quite Ugly One Morning is a wickedly entertaining story but the memory of it fades away after you have finished it. Some stories you will remember forever and buy copies for your friends. Not this one. Worth a read/listen but I will only give it 3.5 stars.A stubborn and brave investigative reporter Jack Parlabane comes along risks his life to expose the culprits and while he is at it, tries to solve a murder of a man who has two fingers one of each hand bitten off.But there is an awful smell also??? How does he hid a dead dog from its owner who lives downstairs. The stench of the decaying dog overwhelms his appartment. He opens windows, covers his mouth with a BRUT drench hankerchief but the tench is still overwhelming. How does he hide the dead dog from its owner or get it past her always watching eyes.The Narrator is excellent!!!! Love the accent!!!!!"
5,Upcoming British Star!,"I believe this was Brookmyre's first book and got me hooked on his writing. For American readers, one word of advice: just schlog through the first chapter! He writes in Scottish-accent so the beginning might be difficult to get into, but, please please, persevere, it is worth it. I laughed out loud - laughed so much I started crying! I have passed the book around to several friends and they all loved it. The story is absolutely crazy and amusing. Brookmyre has written several new books, but I still like this one the best. It is so, in your face and you will never read anything like this again!"
2,Language in 'quite ugly' IS quite ugly,"I bought the ebook since it received such good ratings. While I expect some foul language in a book, I did not expect the language to be as coarse and as frequent as it is. That was a turnoff for me and I stopped reading the book and removed it from my device. Very disappointing."
4,Brookmyre's sterling ear,"Brookmyre has an ear for dialogue and the absurdities of daily life in Scotland that takes us back to Scott's ""The ANTIQUARY."" Nothing is too big or too small for him to lampoon, but with love. He takes a long walk around each of his targets, then closes in, and then--wham. It's nothin' but dust. Not only that, but he can whip up a good crime plot without even breaking a sweat. The banter between his hero and his attractive co-workers is always funny, reminding me of early episodes of the US cult hit MOONLIGHTING, before it lost its cutting edge and went soft.I suppose that's the danger Christopher Brookmyre faces, because along with his current adulation a little bit of softening is bound to creep in like termites in an old house. Never mind, soon he'll be satirizing himself . . . ""quite ugly one morning."""
1,"Poorly written, unfunny, ridiculous dialog","This book tries to be a crude satire of crime novels, and there are a couple of good sentences, but on the whole, the author has no talent for either dialog or story telling. It's painful to read the transparent attempts to be clever that fall flat because if the lack of writing skills."
2,"Author is a typical liberal, just sure the reader will share his political views.","I never continue reading books that the author feels he or she must share their political views. I am a voraciousreader. Read all types of books, including those about politics. When I read fiction, I read it for entertainment. Idon't care or want to know what the authors political beliefs are."
2,quite ugly,I did not care for Quite Ugly as it was not easy to follow the story line and the British type langage was not eash to follow. Also the opening sentence was not to my llking.
4,A Bloody Frolic,"I was hesitant to buy this book based on the description, but more I read the better I liked the story. The hapless hit man is worth the price."
5,"Funny, sharp, and a great plot","I started with the Kindle sample - I woke my wife up I was laughing so hard. I thoroughly enjoyed this book - the characters are vividly drawn, and the plot is complex enough to untangle at a nice pace as the story progresses. This was my first Brookmyre book, and I liked it enough to buy another, which I also enjoyed a great deal. Very highly recommended."
4,Christopher Brookmyre,Quite Ugly One Morning is not just an amusing title but is a very good read and the language used brings back memories of my childhood in Glasgow
5,Keeps things cold and organized.,"It is really easy to change from stoller to stroller. Holds e can and bottles, baby bottles, and water bottles perfectly. Lots of pockets for my keys, phone, sunglasses, and misc. Stays upright and will not tip down."
2,tilts when putting full bottles or cups in it,"We bought a two pack of these. We put one on the side of the stroller (Kidco LS2000) for ds to use and one on the handle for the parents. In order to get the side one not to tilt, we have to put the velcro strap over the folding mechanism. This means every time you go to fold the stroller, you have to remember to move the cupholder off of it first. The one we have on the handle of the stroller won't stay straight no matter what I have done. Since the handle of the stroller is fairly thin there's not a lot for the vecro to wrap around and give it stability. It works ok for water bottles with caps, but not so great w/say a fountain drink or cup of coffee. It is nice they are insulated and have a pocket you can put a small ice pack in to keep drinks cold. I also like the drawstring so you can close it if you don't want anything (rain, debris) falling into the bag."
2,"Good for storage, not for drinks","This is larger than I expected and good for keeping a phone, keys, etc. but the strap that attaches it to the stroller doesn't adjust tightly enough to keep it from sliding around on the bar, and with a heavy drink or full water bottle it tips over and slides around. I ended up buying an Eddie Bauer stroller organizer that I am much happier with."
3,Cup N stuff stroller pocket,"The idea of this cup holder is great, but I can't seem to keep it upright. It always tilts if you put a bottle of water in there and you have to pull the cord tight or the item will fall out. The phone pocket on the side is great and since it has velcro it stays put. Would I buy it again? NO, but since I have it already I'll just do with what I have."
4,Entertaining,"Aftab's character is a doctor and Amisha Patel is his devoted wife. Esha Deol is reigning Ms. World. Aftab and Amisha Patel have been married for 8 years and have a young daughter. Then Esha Deol comes into Aftab's life and things begin to change. Aftab did an ok job. He is unlikeable and portrays a jerk very well - if that is what he was trying to portray. Amisha Patel is effective, but it is annoying that she goes and gets all tough with Esha Deol even though she took marriage vows with Aftab and not Esha Deol. So why doesn't she yell at her husband instead of the outside woman? Esha Deol was definitely the stand out performance. None of the songs really stuck out. The movie is good to watch once."
1,How does it fit?,"For the life of me, I can't figure out how this is supposed to hook up to a V300 or V330. Anyone have any ideas?"
1,External Antenna for Motorola V330,"On the V330, try the hole right next to the stub antenna - remove the plug to access the hole. Love to hear how it works for you!"
4,Solid Capo,"I picked this capo on the recommendation of my brother (who picked it up from our uncle). Very solid, and holds as tight as you want it to thanks to the screw adjustment (instead of relying on springs). It takes longer to put on than a spring loaded capo like a Keiser, but I find that this one doesn't tend to pull the strings out of tune as much as the spring loaded capos do.Now, you cannot store this on your headstock when playing, so if you are on stage and need to add/remove the capo quickly, this will have to go in a pocket. I am very happy with this capo and am glad I spent the extra money for the 'deluxe', but I will probably add a Keiser in to the collection for quicker changes."
5,good capo,"This is a good capo. it's a solid, simple unit that works great. I've had a dozen capos over the years, including 3 Shubbs. I either lost them, lent them, or tossed the crappy ones. I still have one Shubb and it's my main capo. I thought I'd see about this model with the roller. Love it...smooth closing action...my new favorite!"
3,Pretty Nice,"Tiny Toons Montana's movie maddness is a really old game. I have had it for years. It is really hard if you don't know how to play. I have never been able to beat it . The farthest I have gotten is only the 2nd future level. That's it. But this game has good graphics, better than Crash Bandicoot Warped for the playstation. Don't Buy this game if you haven't ever played it or seen it before. Test it out first to see if it is right for you. Otherwise, it is a satisfactory game."
4,cool,this is an exicting game. its not to easy not to hard. i like this game i play it over and over. i don't own it but my friend does so i always play it. once i borrowed it for a month. i played it over and over. i'd love to own it. if i were you i'd buy it right away!!
1,Don't buy this game,This game is the most horrible game ever invented.It is super hard with no codes and saves.I had this game for six years and i still didn't beat it.It was so hard that i broke it apart literally.
5,Great for driving,I love these especially when I'm driving and the sun conditions are constantly changing. I just flip them up when it gets too shady for sunglasses. I use them while walking around for the same reason. I don't have to take them off and risk losing them when conditions darken.
3,Defensive Football 101,"I was in the cast of this ""masterpiece."" Watching it now -- well, it's cute. I know a tiny bit more about football than I did in the early 1990s. However, what sticks out is the video quality. It's not even film! However, if you want a lark and a cute cheerleader asks you to buy it, have fun watching! The one review notes the defensive football teacher looked as if he played for the ""alternative team."" Truer words were never spoken. The actor was super nice but I cannot believe the audience was expected to believe he knew anything about football. I was the girl who took the ""Defensive Football 101"" class multiple times. To this day, I still do not know what a safety does. That's acting, folks! Make the audience believe you know of what you speak......I bought this because it is fun....if you can pick it up for a dollar or two, go for it!"
4,small soldiers,"I think this game is kind of boring. My friend thought itwas fun. All you do is just jump around. Sometimes it's kind offun. The only guy you can get is Chip Hazard and if you get to the second level, you can be Nick Nitro. It's not good graphics."
1,"Surfing by Men, for Men!","As a woman relatively new to surfing, I ordered this book to get some additional insight on the technique and ettiquette of surfing beyond the surfing clinic I took an my experiences this summer surfing North County San Diego. Although this book was somewhat instructional and useful, I was greatly put off by the COMPLETE ommission of any reference to women surfers in the entire book. No words, no pictures, nothing. In addition, references like ""some surfers have even lost their girlfriends because of their passion for surfing!"" (paraphrasing) make it clear that these authors think surfing is for MEN ONLY! With the huge increase in women surfers, I thought a book being published just this past June would give some equality to the sexes."

I find that the 1970's book ""Surfing California"" (which I had also ordered at the same time) is more inclusive to women than this book..."
4,On the right track but I diagree somewhat,"I feel every responsible dog or cat owner should prepare their animal's food. I totally agree with Ann about the commercial pet food industry because I lost a cat to kidney disease after feeding it a popular and costly brand of pet food. Unfortunately, by the time we found out only 25% of her kidneys were functioning. Luckily, through serving her a raw food diet and the advice of a homeopathic vet, my cat lived an extra year and a half with a quality of life any cat would have envied. I have had such great results that several of my friends purchase my raw organic animal food. I firmly believe cooking destroys the enzymes in the food and when you purchase a larger quantity than normal of organic food your grocer will sell it to you for a remarkably lower price. The only ingredient that I cook(overcook, really) is the grain because of the inability of the animal to digest it otherwise."
4,A must read!,This book was excellent! I read it in two sittings (three if you count taking a break for the animal testing chapter **hard to read**). Very informative and lots of sources to further your knowledge with in the back. GREAT reference section! The only thing I didn't really like was the Cat home cooked diet section. My only reason was that it has been my experience that cats and garlic don't mix and most of the recipe's had garlic in them. But otherwise this book was excellent. I would feel comfortable recommending it to anyone!
5,Read this BEFORE you feed your pets!,"I was honored to be asked to write the forward to this wonderful book. While many lay writers really don't have the complete picture about medical topics, Ann has done her homework and backs up her claims. The information really helped me write the diet sections for my 2 recent books, 8 Weeks to a Healthy Dog and the award-winning The Natural Health Bible for Dogs & Cats. For owners who want to answer the question, Do You REALLY Know What You Fed Your Pet Last Night?, this book provides many disturbing answers. Diet is so important to our pets' health; the proper diet is my foundation to every holistic medical protocol I prescribe."
5,Food Pets Die For,"Since I have performance dogs, I was interested to find out about the food I'm feeding. I am appalled to learn about carcasses being included. The only food I have fed is either Canadae or Solid Gold. This book helped confirm that I am doing the right thing for my animals. Have recommended this book to all of my dog friends. It is a must read."
5,THE CRUEL TRUTH ABOUT THE FOOD YOU FEED YOUR PET,"LITTLE DOES THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT THE DOG FOODS THEY FEED THE FAMILY PET CONSISTS OF ROAD KILL, EUTHANIZED PETS, CANCER/CHEMOTHERAPY DRUGS AND ALL OTHER ANIMALS THAT ARE RENDERED FROM ANIMAL HOSPITALS/SHELTERS/HUMANE SOCIETIES AND EVERYWHERE ELSE...UNLESS YOU PAY FOR A SPECIFIC CREMATION OF YOUR PET, IT IS RENDERED WITH MILLIONS OF OTHER PETS...RENDERED IS BOILED UNTIL MEAT IS OFF THE BONES, OR IN HOT OIL. RENDERED PETS ARE PUT IN DOG/CAT FOODS AND MAKEUP, AND ALOT OF OTHER PRODUCTS THAT ARE LABELED ""ANIMAL PROTEIN"" OR ""BONE MEAL"" OR EVEN ""MEAT BY PRODUCTS"" THAT DO NOT SPECIFICALLY SAY THAT IT IS BEEF, PIG, CHICKEN OR TURKEY...ALL THESE CHEMICALS ARE MAKING OUR PETS SICK AND GET CANCER AND DIE AT A YOUNGER AGE. I TRUSTED THE FAMIOUS NAMES AND BRANDS AND THEY ALL HAD THE POISON THAT CAME FROM CHINA...I WORKED IN THIS FIELD FOR YEARS AND COULD NOT TELL THE PUBLIC, BUT NOW I AM FREE TO SPEAK MY MIND...WAKE UP AMERICA!"
3,Foods Pets Die For,The book contains a lot of important information. I guess I was expecting something with a little more depth to it.
3,review of pet food industry - good but not convinced of conclusions,"This book looks into the pet food industry. Though there are some similarities between this book and the Feed Your Pet Right book by Nestle/Nesheim, you will hear very different conclusions in the two books. My guess is that the truth lies somewhere in between. Read both books to get a better idea of what might really be going on."
5,Food Pets Die For,"Ann Martin opened my eyes to the dangers of manufactured pet food. I bought this book because my cat had severe allergies and the vets suggested I change her food to an expensive vet-sold food. She got no better. This book taught me to read the labels on cat food.My cat's allergies are still not completely gone, but she is much better eating the food I make from the recipes in this book. I am convinced it is from a lifetime of eating kitty junk food!I recommend that all pet lovers read this helpful and well-researched book to find out what is in pet food and what health problems are caused by it. I learned to read the labels on pet food and was shocked at what I discovered. Pet food is not as regulated an industry as you assume."
5,If you love your pet -- read this book!,"Extremely informative and shocking look into the pet food industry. You should know what your pet eats and that there is no guidelines on the quality and what goes into the food.After taking the time to read this slowly and absorb it all, I have switched the brand of food I feed my furry babies. It takes some research but the book does give you enough info and some recommendations to check out for yourself.A MUST TO READ if you truly care for your pet!"
1,Stick to the kids' books.,"I call complete BS on Ann M. Martin. This book is a bunch of BALONEY. She bases NONE of her conjectures on any facts what-so-ever, just hearsay and personal opinion. It's sensational crap. She needs to stick to writing children's books and stop using these scare-tactics and misinformation to make a name for herself. Veterinarians sell dog carcasses to dog food companies? PUH-LEASE."
4,Pettalez.com approves this book!,Having a pet website called www.Pettalez.com and being an avid pet lover I feel it is really it is important to make sure you feed your pet good food! I love this book and would recommend it to anyone! Great into and great facts!
1,Food Pets Die For: Shocking Facts About Pet Food,"Have you glanced at this book. I checked it out at the book store. Honestly she seemed from the thumbing through this book for about 30 minute and to be perfectly honest it seemed to be more of a radical writing a very bios book. I know after thumbing through it- I decided it was a BIG WASTE OF MONEY. This book seemed very similar to another book I had looked at (I forget the name of it since it was a while ago) but that book had something to do with I became a vegitarian and will not eat meat. Seems that Ms. Martin would rather write a title with a shocking factor and then write a very bias story. Yes, you need to research your dog food and decide what is the best dog food to feed your dog, but writing stuff like this seemed to me just a way to get her 15 minutes of claim.I had really hoped this book would of been more about how to determine the good and the bad dog food."

4,Different from other EL books but still captivating,"This book is different from other by Ms.Lowell. I was expecting the intensity as seen in her historical series. What I found was a poetic book about the relationships of brother and sister and long lost loves. This flowing story is one to curl up with on a cold, snowy day. The meaning is in the symbolism, not in hot and steaming love sceans as one might expect."
2,Boring,I have read alot of EL books and this one is the first one I was so bored. Too much detail on the making and description of flys and not enough detail in the storyline. I had to put this book down many times before I finally finished it.
1,A Real Stinker,"Ms Lowell's writing is highly formulaic. She has one big love scene in most of her books and then a hugely anti-climactic last few chapters where she laughingly resolves her ""plot"" - a plot device that her non brain dead readers saw coming on page 17.And let me also say about this book, with its hugely unsympathetic characters, NO ONE and I mean NO ONE in the HISTORY OF THE ENTIRE WORLD has EVER been seduced by someone playing an harmonica.That has just never happened. Ever."
1,Forget Me Not? Forget this book!,"What a waste of time. This book was nothing but complete drivel. The heroine (if she could be called that) was annoying, beyond fragile, as if she were the only person in the world to suffer disappointment. The hero was too good for her, but coddled her annoyingly so.Don't waste your time. Pure ..."
1,Choose another,I found this to be my least favorite Elizabeth Lowell book. The plot and characters were extremely weak in my opinion. It is the only Elizabeth Lowell book that I have read the ending of before getting through the third chapter.
2,Rather thin concept,"Alana's amnesia gets boring. The trauma must have affected more than her memory, as her perception of events around her is rather lacking also. The hero, Rafe, acted stupidly in his initial rejection of her, then doesn't seem to get much brighter in trying to make up.All in all, other EL books are more rewarding. This one is for when you have nothing else to do."
3,not the greatest,"It was okay, I guess, but the plot was focused to much on her fear and loss of memory, rather than the romance between them. Maybe it's just me, but I thought it was actually rather boring. I wish I had gotten it from the library rather than bought it!"
2,DISSAPOINTING.......,"This is my fifth book of Elizabeth Lowell. So far, I'm a little dissapointed especially this one. The story line is weak, the characters not properly set. There is very little funny stuffs in the book. EL was trying to create the constraints between the man and woman but failed to do so. Overall, it's definitely not a good romance. (TRY SUSAN ELIZABETH PHILLIPS and you will get what I mean as a good romance)"
3,Hermidifier 447 replacement Filter,"Filter was narrower than original - 7 1/4 inch - should have been 8"" so had to cut from length to make 1 inch piece to fill gap! Fortunately longer than original so cutting and piecing was possible but inconvenient. Dimensions should be 19 inch x 8 inch x 1 inch - if was available this would be perfect!!"
5,I endorse the author,"I know Barton Goldsmith as a colleague, a thinker and an author. He's a delightful and thoughtful professional. His probing intellect and encouraging nature make him the perfect author for a book like this. I encourage you to buy any and all of his works. You will be better because of it."
2,"OK, but not for the normal couple","The book is interesting if you are into the sappy, lovey dovey type stuff. ""Holding hands and looking into each others eyes and telling each other about your day..."" Just not what I was really looking for."
5,The Greatest Generation of Cooks,"Those of us living in this age of plenty have no idea what it was like to cook during World War II when sugar, butter, meat and oh, so many canned foods were rationed. I was a very little girl then and didn't understand so many of the hardships my mother endured. This book answers so many of the questions left unanswered and for me it is a joy to read. I do remember many of the recipes included here and for old times sake, I plan to give many of them a try. This book is a must for anyone interested in food or food history. We may not cook this way today-- we don't have to. But these old make-do recipes can teach us all a lot."
4,Well Done,"This book was extremely well done. The balance between recipes, history and reminiscence was perfect, whether you're looking to relieve old memories or get a glimpse of the past before your time.The recipes were versatile, inexpensive and different than most of what I've seen in similarly themed books. The organization was good, everything was easy to read, and it was user-friendly all around. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.Probably the most unique thing about this book was the focus on nutrition; with some items in short supply compliments of wartime rationing, finding ways to balance nutritional needs was of paramount importance. This book includes many of the tips, tricks and ideas women used to ensure their families were getting properly balanced meals despite the lack of steak and other muscle meats."
4,Sinatra at his best (4.5 stars would be my grade),"The Naked Runner is not as well-known as it should be. Frank Sinatra plays an ex-commando who is recruited to rub out a foreign leader. The people recruit him by abducting his son and giving him the ultimatum ""Kill our enemy, or else."" Sinatra is manipulated cleverly and battles against his own sense of right and wrong and the desire to get his son back alive. The film is entertaining from start to finish."
2,disappointed,I had big hopes for these headphones but they are VERY uncomfortable and stiff. I have to wear them for long periods of time and even for a few minutes they were horrible. I have Sony MDR7506's and for the money.. I had much higher expectations. In terms of comfort they are terrible and frankly my sony's had much higher output when set at the same volume level. I'm a sound editor and mainly deal with production recordings so noise floor is very important to my work and being able to hear the detail... don't waste your money.
2,Only works for sensitive/dry skin,"I have combination skin and used this product only about 3 days before my oilier areas completely broke out. I've noticed all the rave reviews are from people will sensitive or dry skin. On my drier areas the cleanser worked great- but this is not a good cleanser for normal, oily, or combination skin.(Tangent: I recommend PeterThomasRoth Combination Skin Cleansing Gel for anyone with combination skin. I've never found anything that strikes such a great balance.)"
4,Excellent First Entry,"This is a strong debut release for the band that is worth the price of admission for ""Rain Yr Hand"" alone. Pick up a copy today."
4,"""i can't believe you could be so selfish""","Rainer Maria's debut EP is raw, emo-tional and simply a great listen. Highly recommended for people who already love this band or are new to their particular blend of rock and poetry. A real knockout, especially ""Rain Yr Hand."""
3,Adequate Introductory Book,"This has been a good introductory book. The language is somewhat simplistic but other than that it is a fine book. His chapter on definitions in some ways adds to the confusion that is the current state of hermeneutics.For the serious student this book should be supplemented by Robert Thomas' book on Hermeneutics ""Evangelical Hermeneutics"""
4,Pretty good,"It was a literary read, big words but well explained for the most part. Has great examples,chapter on parables is worth a few days study."
5,A Must Own Resource for Bible Readers,Of all the books I've read on Bible study and interpretation this one is by far my favorite. It is highly readable and the concepts are applicable. You feel like you walk away with something tangible at the end of each chapter. There are many books on Bible study methods and interpretation but many of them are dated not so much in their content but more so in their writing style and terminology. Many of the older books on this subject are riddled with 1950s era vernacular and filled with grammatical minutiae but not Zuck's book. This is a gem amidst the growing number of pop theology books and I highly recommend this as a staple in your Bible study resource collection.
4,Good book,Nice condition. Helpful insight can be a bit dry and complicated but very good tool to interpret bible. Roy Zuck is very good author. Some of his doctrinal points go against my beliefs but it makes sense how he is coming to his conclusions.
2,"Use receipts and thermal fax paper, not this.","This paper is getting old, and as it is thermal, it worsens with age. Using receipts from stores or buying thermal fax paper or NCR receipt paper will give you better results."
1,the paper sucks,It's all old stock and the thermal paper does not print well.However I did find that regular thermal paper from a cashier machine works really well but it does not come in sticker form.
2,Game Boy printer paper,It's old and consequently doesn't handle the print ink very well. It's brown and light instead of dark black. That's it.
5,100% Satisfied,"As things go for dart board cabinets, this one is somewhat well made. Requires a low to moderate skill level to correctly mount. Maybe a little pricy, however it looks great and functions well in my basement rec room. 100% satisfied."
5,Quality Marvel Superhero Figures,"Excellant action figure set. The likenesses are on the money and provide fantastic display or play figures. I bought one set for me to display and another for my son (Ethan age 4 1/2) to play with. These figures are perfect compliments to the numerous other ""Famous Covers"" figures from Marvel and the DC Comics 9"" figures (Superman vs. Wolverine- yeah!!!). Sure the old Megos are still the sentimental favorites when it comes to Superheroes figures, but you have to admit the overall quality of these new figures far exceed the 1970's products. Collect, play, or do both with these nice toys. Enjoy!"
3,Wolverine 2-Pack Action Figure Set,"These figures are primarily intended for the collectors and avid X-Men fans. The figures are not of the highest quality in comparison to past action figures Toy-Biz has produced over the years. Quality is good enough to warrant the demand by devoted collectors, but as others have noticed, durability leaves a lot to be desired by parents and children for actual play ability...unless of course the child is real careful with the figure, but then, what's the point...? It's called an action figure for a reason..."
3,X-Men Movie Action Figures,I think this was a great ideal to created the movie version and the classic comic version of wolverine. I only wish the manufacturer toy biz would have kept creating there marvel famous covers line there was a lot of comic character that were not created.
1,You Call This A Mortal Kombat Game?,"This game was 'INCREDIBLY' terrible! Here's Why...1.)Awful Graphics (slow animation) 2.)Only 6 people to choose from! (scorpion,reptile,liu kang,jax,shang tsung, and kitana) 3.)Terrible Control! 4.)And finaly...the blood is just little black...dot...things!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!"
2,Ugh. Why the Game Boy?,"This game is horrid! The graphics and the framerate are too choppy! The sound's okay (sound effect wise), but MKII was never known for it's music. The control is absolutely horrid; there aren't enough buttons on the Game Boy and special moves are nearly impossible to pull off (much less FATALITIES, as there's only one per character).But the worst of it all happens to be the gameplay. Seriously, I beat this game in half an hour! And when did blood ever become an ink error?Not worth the price. I suggest that you should dust off your Super NES and buy that version. Avoid Mortal Kombat II on the Game Boy at all costs. The only thing worse than this is the Game Boy port of Mortal Kombat 3."
4,MKII,"People say this game is bad, but its the best mk game on the gameboy. while it only has 2 levels and 1 fatality per character the gameplay is great. The people move fast and the controls are responsive, which is alot more than i can say for most fighters on the gameboy. while it lacks blood color and may not be as nice as the gamegear version its still not bad."
4,"Good, but not much in it.","This is a very good game that is very limited. As far as I know, it is almost impossible to do any really 'neat' Fatalities before the timer runs out and even on difficult, it is not a challenge to beat. Probably the greatest challenge is figuring out how to get to battle Jade every single time. Mind you all, the graphics are ok for the timing it was created it, but still, could have had a bit more..."
3,prompt service,I bought these games as a Christmas present and don't plan on playing them but delivery was prompt.
3,Instructions,Like wish we could get the game Burgertime and the Tron Game but do like also wish instructions could be printed
2,90% UNPLAYABLE!!,"About 90% of this game is unplayable!! largly in part to the fact that the intellivision had a very uniqe controller thus rendering this game mostly unplayable. Buy this game only if you are a die hard collector. they really should have included a packaged controller, so what if the game would have cost more at least you would be able to play it!"
5,Sunflower - Sophia Loren,"This is one of the fifteen or so films that have stayed in my mind throughout my life. I first saw the film more than thirty years ago. The acting and plot may be banal. When seen today, the film is distinctly old-fashioned in technique and treatment. However, the film still touches a chord: it deals with a forgotten group of people (Italians captured during WW2), it deals with a wife who believes her lost husband to be still alive, it deals with a situation in which the impersonal forces of history come face-to-face with the reality of individual human beings. The film is an enduring classic, and Sophia Loren's superb Italian humanity still gives the film an everlasting appeal."
3,informative for sure,"not knowing alot about vietnam, i went into watching this dvd set with an open mind. it is very informative, but i found the presentation a bit dry at times, and woke up on the couch a few times also after i fell asleep while watching. there are a few chapters that i found memorable though: one on the 7th cavalry was fascinating i thought, the fall of saigon was interesting to watch unfold, and a cameo from John Wayne had me at hello. die hard vietnam learning stuff person? get it, h"
3,Propaganda,"For me this is a very interesting collection of government propaganda about the Vietnam War. In that I am using it in a class about Vietnam, some of it is very useful. Most of the pieces or produced by one government agency or another and are of that general quality. It would be difficult to sit through all 50 documentaries."
1,Pathetic at Best,This is over 23 hours of American propaganda films a lot of them are titled the Big Picture should give you some idea of what I am talking about. This deals with basically how we are trying to brain wash the local vietnamese to our way of thinking and what we are doing there in general and absolutely nothing to do with the war as far stratedgy and battles are concerned. You won't see fire fights or the like which is what I was expecting.In short someone got a hold of a bunch of training/propaganda films and put the whole mess under a misleading title for obvious financial gain. What a shame. Avoid this at all cost.
1,Dont waste your money.,Just a bunch of 10 min. clips of 60's propaganda. Some of the chapters didnt play on my DVD for some reason.
3,"Too Political, not a true picture of our war.","I purchased 2 different Vietnam war DVD's from Amazon, this was useless to me. I served in Nam back in 1966, and know how horrible it was to be there. Unfortunately this DVD tells a story from the political side of the fence, and does not reflect what was going on in Nam, but instead shows you all the politicians view points that they fed the public during that war, all untrue or covered up! I would suggest that you not buy this DVD but purchase ""Vietnam in HD"" it's not the war we know, it's the war they fought. This Vietnam in HD gives you an excellent perspective of what was really happening in Nam, nothing like the political version. It shows the real horrors of the war, where our military fought sometimes 24 hours a day to stay alive, But be prepared for some very graphic scenes in the Vietnam in HD DVD,it's not for young children."
4,Vietnam War American Conflict,"I found it very interesting to watch,I had friends that was there and it was something I have been instered in for a long time.IT is a movie to watch,"
1,Right Wing Propaganda,"This series will make you stomach crawl because of the blatant neo con point of view. This war killed 50,000 of us for no good reason, and this DVD series acts like we should do it all over again. When will we learn we are not the world's keeper?"
3,Pilot driving lights 509,"These would be great lights if it were not for the small intense beam. Driving lights normally cast a spread beam of light that substitute the OEM headlights well. These lights have a very small bright beam, a beam associated more with a fog light instead of a driving light. Other than that, the lights look great and are made well. I prefer the plastic construction, since it cannot rust. These lights should be called fog lights instead of driving lights. So when buying, keep in mind what type of beam you desire. If it weren't for the small intense beam, I would have rated these lights as a five."
3,Great lights for ATV or Lawn Mower,"I live in TN and drive back roads at night a lot running service doing HVAC repair and needed better lighting for all the twist and turns, ups and downs. This product does not fill this need, however they do work well but not enough beam to help. I plan on giving them to a friend for his side by side ATV where they may be of use."
4,"looks cool, but not too powerful","These were a steal at $20. The casing and mounting brackets are all plastic, which is a good thing with all the salt we have in the Northeast. The glass lenses have a subtle bluish tinge, which I guess looks kind of cool. When you look at the lights head on, they seem really bright, but they don't project very far. Like another reviewer said, they are more like fog lights than driving lights. They still help me a little, but I'm considering replacing them with something stronger."
4,Very Good Book,"This book was helpful, more so than others I've read. I would reccomened buying it. This book has a lot of useful information. The charts and timelines are very nice also."
5,a great addition to any doors collection,not many of us ever got to see the doors in concert but when i got to here this cd of live performances and never heard versions of my favorit doors songs and never before released songs you once again realized how talented these guys were i think that if you get a chance to here a band at its most rawest time which some of these tracks are it truly does bring back the feel of the 60s and that jim morrison and the doors were ahead of thier time mike zuchowski reading PA.
5,Great Variety,"Although the sound quality could have been better on some of the demo cuts, it is still intresting to hear morrison as a young and more timid vocalist. Before the band became big, like hearing somewhat of an evolution of tracks such as Moonlight Drive and Hello, I love you. A real highlight is the demo of Hyacinth House, it really displays morrison's vocal and songwriting abilities. robbie really stands out and plays well on roadhouse blues and break on through."
5,Nice gems,"Listening to it now. So when that box set comes out, with a disc of rarities, here's one instance where waiting matters. Thank you for releasing this extra bit for fans who already have all the other albums. I wouldn't have bought the box set just for it, but sell it separately, and I'm more than game. It's all great... the closest thing I'll get to a ""new"" Doors album (unless the band gets some real ""balls"" and records new material with Ian, which would be a real kick!). These gems are well worth it..."
5,What a lady and what a great story,"To think that a woman in the 1850s could accomplish so much and push legislation through Congress before women had much power in this country is astonishing. The author is correct -- She is the most admired woman of her time. It is too bad that her Uncle James Buchanan's legacy relegated her to historical obscurity. Hopefully, thanks to Milton Stern's entertaining style and knowledge of the facts along with his incredible research, Americans can once again get to know the woman who was the first to be called First Lady."
5,Great!,"Better than most GameBoy games(matches up with 1989 SolarStriker), it features you, Turok, killing dinosaurs and guys with guns, axes and more! You start with a sword defeating them. Explore caves, go through transports, pick up new weapons on your journey.Note: I said ""killing"", but it's not a bloody game."
4,FUN! but very challing,This game has 8 levles of non stop action and 7 bosses that each have their own weak spots. one of the good thing about it that it has passwords that relly help.
4,For anyone preparing to write a thesis,"I am a Master's degree student in the throes of writing my thesis. Initially, I had absolutely no idea how to go about the process until I took a class in which this book was part of the cirriculum. Shively breaks down the process step by step and prepares you for contingencies that are bound to happen along the way. Chapter two is especially useful in learning how to choose a topic and furthermore, a question from which to base a thesis."
4,Useful for qualitative political science,"It seems like there are a lot of books discussing the ""how-tos"" of political science research. This one doesn't stand out according to one criteria. However, I did think it's discussion of measuring variables, particularly its attention to qualitative empirical work, was useful. Much if the discipline today is so quantitative that sometimes texts forget to instruct students on how to think in terms of qualitative variables. This is important for issues such as ranking the prestige of various officials under communist regimes (an example from the book). Best combined with another book with a more quantitative focus."
4,3 rivers,"I love the 3 Rivers Cookbooks! This product was purchased used, but was still in quite excellent conditon! Only minor wear."
1,Lenovo is awful,The very worst product I have ever owned from any company. The worst computer I have ever had experience with. There customer service is non existent. There quality control is awful. If you deal with this company you will be ripped off. I would give them a zero if that was an option.
1,"If you get frustrated easily, DO NOT BUY THIS","This printer prints just fine ... when you gan get the paper to load properly!! The paper tray is so poorly designed it's a complete nightmare! If you don't get frustrated by poor designs, then by all means give this one a go. But if you are at all like me, and expect your electronics to perform consistantly day after day... THEN STEER CLEAR OF THIS ONE!"
1,Rip Off!,"The cost of this all-in-one machine was pretty low, so I bought it. The box bragged about not wasting ink because each color has a separate cartridge, so I thought it was a good product. While I can't complain about the fax or scan components, the printer is primitive, and the ink is a killer! It can't print double-sided, unless you find creative and laborious ways to do this manually (no thanks), and it spits out multiple-paged documents in reverse order, so you have to reshuffle yourself. I rarely print things on this, but I probably spend $100 a year in ink. Furthermore, I print in black and white 95% of the time, but somehow the colors run out almost as fast as the black. When I compare the weight of a so-called empty cartridge with that of a new cartridge, there is barely a difference. You can still shake the cartridge and hear liquid in there, but the machine refuses to print! It is a complete scam, and I will never buy another Brother product because of this!"
1,junk,"The title says it all. As other reviewers have noted, the paper handling is a nightmare. In my case, the tray is stuck, so that the only way I can get paper in is to crack open the top less than inch and slide in a few sheets. The printer takes so long to start up that every time I attempt to use it, the operation times out in Windows an I have to restart the job to even get it to actually put ink on paper. Avoid this machine at all costs. Brother should never have put this Edsel on the market, but afterwards, should have had the decency to recall it and refund every penny the purchasers paid. I will avoid all Brother products in the future, and so should you.More bad news: The color cartridges supposedly are empty, and the printer refuses to print even in gray scale. I'm buying a new printer before wasting another penny on this Edsel."
2,not good for photo scan,I brought this to faciliate scanning of photos. It has a straight line feeder which works well upto 10 photos. It did a great job for about two weeks. Then I noticed scratch lines down the length of the scanned image. They were not always in the same place. Cleaning the plate did not help. Very frustrating in trying to remove theses 'scratches' from the scanned image.
4,Good value for money,"If you need an average quality printer for casual printing at home, some faxing ability and a copier as well, this is a good all-in-one printer. I read about some other people having paper feeding issues but I have not had any in last 3 weeks use. I bought it for $60 knowing very well that the quality of prints will not be super fine.One problem I find with it is that the incoming faxes cannot be received on the computer. They can only be printed as they are received in."
1,Brother....oh brother,"When I'm dissatisfied with a product, I tend to not bother to review. The Brother MFC-3360 on the other hand deserves to be reviewed. I'll sum it up thusly: What a steamin', stinkin', pile of sh**. I'm tossing this piece of garbage and buying an HP. 'Nuff said."
2,tray jammed,"I bought a 3360C for my mother. The problem is not paper jamming, but the whole damn tray getting stuck. It's a bad design. I don't know what to do except take the machine apart.Any ideas?"
1,If you look up bad design in the dictionary....,I also bought this product - I will return it tomorrow. The paper tray is so poorly designed that it will astound you. I could not get the paper to feed.
3,"jams easily, paper feeding is bad, others are all good","I got this one for as a deal (only $20 something), so I have to say it worths the money.I use this machine for printing, copying and scanning, havn't tried fax yet. The results are quite good. However, there is a big hassle: this machine is really poor at paper feeding. It fetches more than one paper at a time quite often, which is quite annoying. I have to hold the paper to avoid this problem. I never use it to print or copy a many-page job. Another problem is: it jams easily. If paper output is slightly blocked by something (may be by your hand), the paper just spit out will be sucked in again by the motor and cause a jam."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,"This sorry excuse for a printer runs out of ink faster than a printing press. Print 20 pages and it tells you to replace the ink. The worst part is IT WILL NOT PRINT ANYTHING IF ANY OF THE COLORS ARE EMPTY!!! Thats right, it will not print a black only piece of paper if it is out of yellow. I will never buy another Brother product again. My HP 300 series was half the price and kicked twice as much ass."
2,Really is Dark Oak in color.,"I wanted one of these for the computer desk, but many places had them listed for over $200, which is way stupid money. I got this in the other day, and it looks good. Be aware that is about three shades darker than the picture above. I will post an update in a few months to let you know if it holds up.Update 25 Sept 11It does not hold up that well. Many creases and a few cracks. Now in all fairness, I am a 250lb guy. Perhaps for a person who weighs less, it might have held up better. However, I was in Loews and had a minor epiphany. When this thing tanks, I will get a half sheet of 3/8"" plywood, and a box of that new lock together flooring. There is a large variety of colors and types of material available. I figure I can spend an afternoon and put together something much stronger for less than half the price I spent on this trash."
4,The Old Classics,"When I saw these programs, I felt like I was watching ""The Twilight Zone"". They were brillent. Many directors helped make these and the episodes on this tape are some of the best ever aired. They are genius. They are incredible. Some are even downright chilling. If you like creepy, you'll love this."
4,Excellent package,"Surfing through Amazon, repetively and quite tediously, I see the awe-inspiring Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece Collection. Now as a cheap college student who loves movies, I don't exactly have the cash for that kind of dedication. Perhaps later.However, I came across this treasure. A nice collection of various early Hitchcock movies, along with some radio appearances.I received the DVD collection for about $6. Wow! I've never gotten 3 discs for $6. In any caes, when I played some of the movies just to check, the quality isn't exactly top-knotch. But what do you expect from 6 bucks? At least it feels like I'm in the 1940s again, right? Overall, a great buy."
4,Good for the money,I especially enjoyed the movies. The other content was not so compelling. The quality of the video is fine--I would buy it again.
5,"Great set, but another has these and more.","This set is great, but for a cheaper price, you can have all these movies plus many more. At the time of this writingAlfred Hitchcock: The Legend Begins(with 20 of his films) is only $5.18. I highly recommend that one over this one. In the comments here, I will post a link to my review of that set, in case you WISH to see why I recommend it. I'm not affiliated with the DVD set in any way (you can see all my reviews which will prove that), but I'm just a big fan.As for this one, the films here are excellent and if you like classic film as well as Hitchcock, you won't be disappointed."
4,Excellent for fans of the movie,"I have been playing for three or four years and found most of the music, with the exception of the ""Chamber of Secrets"" theme, which has many accidentals, very easy to sight-read. The music is easily recognized as that from the movie in most cases - I'm not so sure how many could recognize ""Moaning Myrtle"" - and makes an excellent accompaniement for the soundtrack of the second Harry Potter movie. Not recommended for those who can play by ear well."
4,Laser grips,Easy to install and align. No complaints. They do what the say. Price has come down over the years. Would recommend.
4,Mobil 1 Deal,NAPA automotive in my area (Rapid City SD and surrounding towns) is selling Mobil 1 Pure Synthetic for $5.98 a quart - that's a good deal. Do not know how long the sale will last but worth a shot.
3,Group III synthetic.,"Mobil 1 Isn't a bad oil. In fact it's a pretty good oil. I have used Mobil 1 for years in my autos. Is Mobil 1 the best oil you can put in your engine? I don't think so. First off Mobil 1 is a group III synthetic, which means it is not 100% PAO Synthetic. I now use an oil that's Group IV (100% Pure) Synthetic that out performs Mobil 1 and all other synthetics."
1,what criteria was used for the oil test,"Ok, those are major brands of oil and everyone will agree that they are good oils but just what criteria was used to evaluate them? Advertising hype? actual testing?"
5,25 years experience with Mobil 1,"I won't use anything else in my cars. When I buy a car, I keep them and take very good care of them. My most experience with Mobil 1 was on my 1995 Eagle Talon TSi turbo which I bought new. I sold the car last year and the motor was still like new with 180,000 miles on it. Even the turbo was still like new. I used Mobil 1 from about 8k miles on. I sold it in August of 2008 to a young motor-head an he's since put another 20k on the motor. 200k on a turbo 4g63? that's some good oil. And when you checked inside the valve cover, like new. The cams had no wear. Seals on the motor never leaked. I currently run mobil 1 in all our cars which includes an '08 Toyota Avalon, '03 Maxima 6 speed, and an '02 accord. The accord has 140k on it, still running like new. I break in the new cars with dino then switch 'em to Mobil 1. I also extend the drain intervals to 7-10k."
5,The 1 they are all trying to beat...,"I've used this motor oil on a '89 Corrolla got 279,000 miles on it engine was fine. On a 1995 Corrolla got 192,000 miles before it too was junked. In both cases the engines were in excellent shape the bodies just got broken (deer etc.)There is no better motor oil,in my book than this. I live in a cold climate. Regular oil will congeal and flow like molasses in cold weather. That's where engine wear takes place. Mobil 1 stays fluid at extremely low temps. Do this experiment, take a jar with a tight lid and put Castrol 5w30 and Mobil 1 5w30 oil in them. Leave them in the freezer for a few days. Take them out and turn them over. You'll see why Mobil 1 is superior."
5,Test results are great,"Every time I change my oil I send a sample to a lab [...] with an extra test for TBN (additives). Test after test the oil comes in with high marks. The lab recommends the next change interval every sample and I'm up to 12,000 mile intervals now (don't try it yourself without a lab's recommendation)"
5,Brilliant!,"I first heard this group on NPR one morning, and went crazy trying to find anything about them online. After a while I gave up and went on with my life, always keeping an eye out. I, too, was at B&N and saw an endcap of French music. I was happy enough with that until my view panned down to the bottom shelf of the display. I put the headphones on, listened to two tracks, and realized that the cd was exactly wonderful, and bought it. I am so thrilled that I picked it up. Paris Combo is my favorite release of 1999. With their traditional French and Gypsy sounds mixed together in a perfect jazz cocktail, I find myself listening all the time. Also, a related recommendation: If you like this cd, you'll also like the cd Sympathique by the group Pink Martini."
5,"Brilliant, hypnotic, haunting",".Paris Combo's self-titled debut album is a tour of another world, a forgotten era, when music moved your heart but was classy and seductive at the same time.There is no one today producing a sound like this. Their music will stay with you; it is mesmerising."
5,Ca me plaise beaucoup!,"Ce disque-compacte est tres interessant! Belle Du Berry, leur chanteuse, peut faire tout les choses! Elle ecrit, elle chante, et tout le monde dans Paris Combo sont tres chic! Achetez ce disque!"
3,Early American jazz style with a French taste,The artist have done a good job recreating the catsby style of american jazz music of the early part of the20th century. music
4,"Fun, Fun and more Fun!","This is an uplifting and quite exotic album. I particulary like ""moi, mon ame..."". It makes you feel like you are in some kind of forties dance club somewhere in Morroco. The songs aren't particularly memorable but they are great for a party for people into exotic music and a happy time."
3,"Sugarbabes ""Push the Button""...Hot...Hot...Hot....","I rate this 5 stars...not sure why Amazon limited me to 3.I saw the video for ""Push the Button"" on a recent trip to Italy....I'm not sure MTV will play it here in the states....but ""Push the Button"" is a great, catchy pop song. I purchased the enhanced CD for the video...it's half the fun!!!Hopefully enough of us will buy this CD so that Sugarbabe Mutya Buena can buy some long pants for the upcoming winter months.You have to see the video to catch that one. Well worth the $12.99 American.Treat yourself to a guilty pleasure like ""Push the Button""!"
5,"Push the button, play the song...","This is a great song with a great video. I didn't like the Sugarbabes when they first came out, but they have grown on me and I have liked most of their songs for a while now, but this one is definitely a favourite.Take three lovely girls, dressed in three hot outfits; add a lift, three cute guys, and a funky song with great dancing, poppy lyrics and a whole heap of fun.It's a great song, nothing mind shattering about it, you can dance to it, sing along with it or just simply enjoy the beat which is really catchy.The Sugarbabes have come a long way, let's hope they can keep it up."
4,"Great disk #1, one great tune on disk #2","Saint Saens is, in my opinion, one of classical music's more underappreciated composers. This CD set, especially the first disk, will tell you why.Piano concertos #2 and #4, both on the first disk, are, to my knowledge, Saint Saens' most famous works and deservedly so. Very melodic, memorable pieces. I've also found that piano concerto #1 is a real pleasure, though one with which I was less familiar before I bought this CD set.The second disk, featuring piano concertos #3 and #5, is less engaging, I think. Indeed, it's curious that the CD doesn't present the piano concertos in order. It's almost as if ""the good stuff"" was purposely put on the first disk.The exception is Saint Saens' inventive and creative African fantasy at the end of the second disk. This is a rousing piece of music that reminds me a lot of Gershwin. It's track #8 on the second disk if you want to jump right to it when you put in the second disk. That's what I find myself doing..."
4,"Great performances, so so recording.","The performances of all the concertos were outstanding, and the price was excellent. However, the sound could have been better. The recording was not up to the best standards of EMI. Not having heard the original full price releases, which sold for about four times the price, I do not know if they sounded the same or if remastering of the later releases was poorly done. Nevertheless, a great way to obtain all of these pieces at a low price."
5,shubb c1 capo,"this is the best capo i've ever used! it doesn't over stress the strings, and it can be adjusted to eliminate buzz, no matter where on the neck it goes."
5,Shubb C1 Nickel Capo,"Small, adjustable pressure, very pleased with the capo.Easy to use with a nice clean sound up the fretboard. I would recommend it instead of all capos I have ever used, and I've been playing a long time."
5,wonderful mix of styles,"The lead singers soulful and sultry voice is all that ties this compilation into a cohesive disc, but it is so powerful it does it well. The musical styles are varied and it makes wonderful to listen to over and over."
4,Great CD!,I like this CD a lot. She's like Fiona Apple but with the essence of an earlier era. Rockin' and soulful. I like it.
5,Very Addictive!,Devil Doll is the best ting to happen to music in a long time. All eighteen songs are great and worth every penny spent!
2,not what your looking for,if your looking for the ORIGINAL devil doll from Mister doctor this isnt it and i doubbt you find one of his CDs on anything but an auction site
1,story of devil doll,"Italy, 1987, Mr.Doctor introduced 'Mark of the Beast', under the artist name 'Devil Doll', he's created numerous masterpieces, unlike anything ever composed...It isn't right for THIS band to use the name 'Devil Doll', Mr.Doctor has earned the name, and anybody familiar with his work will only laugh at THIS band."
2,Just okay.,"I like her style, but the music lacks energy, movement, melody... it basically falls flat. Her vocals could use some work. Her voice is pleasing, but she doesn't add any interesting variations. It also falls flat. Overall though, it's a good start in the right direction. It just needs a shot of vibrancy all around."
4,Fun and sexy,"This is a great album that grows on me the more I listen to it. The band is fantastic (love the upright bass!) and I love Colleen's voice.The songs are from all different genres, but they still have that jazzy, sexy, punk, quality that ties them all together and makes up the Devil Doll sound. I know that sounds odd, but after you hear it, you'll know what I mean. I'm not even sure how to classify it, maybe rockabillyjazzypunk?My favorite song is probably Things You Make Me Do (great lap dance song). I also love 16 Days, Bourbon In Your Eyes, Driven To Distraction, and Liquor Store. All very sexy songs.There really isn't a bad song on the album. Even the ones that I'm not that into are still very good."
3,Good,"Definitely make sure you listen to a few sample tracks before you decide to commit to a purchase. Devil Doll has, considering the musical scene of today, a unique style that harkens back to days gone by. Make sure you like what you are getting otherwise buyers remorse will find you quickly."
4,A Realistic YA Romance,"Collette, like any other sixteen year old girl, dreams of meeting Mr. Right; a guy that will sweep her off her feet, and who will put an end to her miserable single status. Miraculously, Collette meets Mr. Right -handsome, wealthy, and brooding Art. Is he the perfect guy she has set her heart on, or is he too good to be true ?Though the synopsis screams A Typical YA Romance Fulff, the story comes out stronger than usual ChikLits. Kate Cann, recounts a realistic story about juvenile infatuations and the somewhat disastrous results they can sometimes cause, in a light and somewhat cynical voice projected through an average young girl. Despite her obvious flaws, the character is very round, and you'll keep rooting for her throughout the book. Honestly, I didn't like the book until I was halfway through it, but in the end it turned out to be a very good one.(Taken from my review on shelfari)"
2,What is this?,"Mortal Kombat dominated arcades and home consoles worldwide, but did it dominate handhelds? No. No it did not. The Game Gear version was fairly good, but the Game Boy port suffered from really slow gameplay, dull music, and no sound effects. The graphics were okay, but it didn't help keep the Game Boy version from getting a fatality.This is possibly the worst Mortal Kombat game."
2,NO!! NO!!!,"What is this? I ordered this game a while back expecting something like the other MKs. Well boy was i wrong! I takes 5 hours just ot do a single punch and 7 hours to do a single kick! God for bid the machine is faster than I am. Plus everything is in black and white. To me its just to sticks fighting each other.And there is only like 5 characters to choose from! Bottom line, for those of you who were thinking of buying this game... DON'T DO IT!!!! Its a waste of your money. Buy MK Trilogy now thats a good game."
2,Mortal Kombat 1 for Game Boy,"For those of you that have played the original MK for Sega, know that the graphics werent that good. The graphics on MK for Game Boy arent that much better. There isnt as much blood, gore, and guts as there are in other Mortal Kombat games, so this one is a good one for parents whos kids want Mortal Kombat, but theyre concerned about all the violence. All in all, the game is a disapointment to fighting game fans, but a good buy for concerned parents with blood-hungry kids."
1,Disk doesn't work.,"I receieved this game to find out that even though it was described to be playable on PS2, to find out this brand new disc does not even read on my PS2. Note I have no problems with any other PS2 games I own. This was the first one that was unplayable. I've heard this type of thing happening to other PS2 owners and now know the gaming tales are sadley true."
1,Stay away from this one!!!,"Avoid this game. Most of games in here were made on late 70's. I wouldn't mind how old they are, the thing is they ain't fun at all. Another problem I found also is that a very few of this games in here, you cannot play because you must have someone to play with. Because it requires two controls. If you are looking for those great games that we grown up with. Try Activision Anthology. You won't regret."
4,Better then owning an Intellivision.,"I never owned this system as a kid and to be honest I'm glad, But I'm also glad to have a descent collection of video games for about 6 bucks. So in theory I could say that I currently own an Intellivision System and most of its top games....."
5,A campy charley angels,"This show should have had a longer run. It is campy but also very playful and an excellent spoof on TV spy shows. The writing is funny and creative.The stars are beautiful and play their roles almost straight but the moments they step out of the roles it fits perfectly with the story line. The shows are fluff and easy to enjoy.Make dinner for your partner, a nice wine, and put on she spies. By the end of the first episode, between the wine and the laughter, your partner will know what a wonderful sense of sophisticated humor you have."
3,Episodes on DVD have been slightly edited...,"I loved this show. However, I am disappointed by the new dvd release. heres why:On television, before most of the commercial breaks, the image turned into a still, then transformed into a telescope sight.At the end of the commercial break, the same thing happened but in reverse.The new dvds are missing these bumpers. The show fades out rather quickly then fades in just as quickly.This causes both truncation in video and music content.During its original run, the telescope transitions were not at every commerical break, but at most of them.Shame on MGM for cutting this episodes.If you can live without this slight alteration, get the set. the show is fun and the girls are quite fetching."
4,FINALLY!!!!,"I have been waiting for ""She Spies"" to be released on DVD for a very very long time. I absoulutly love this series. Its a shame it was cancelled."
3,Charlie Angels-NOT,"She*Spies is a Charlie's Angels ripoff combined with the Robert Wagner show ""It Takes a Thief"" and James (Jane) Bond concepts. Three sexy females being released from prison to spy for the government as She*Spies. You can see some of the Bond jokes coming and some seem almost hurtfulSometimes this show takes the spy satire a bit too far. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. This show like VIP has many INJOKES...Some seem to fall flat on their face. However when it works, its really funnyThis 20 espisode four disk set has no extras...just episodes, if you like VIP with less plot, you will like She*SpiesBennet Pomerantz, AUDIOWORLD"
2,Not perfect but works.,"Product arrived with a metal piece loose, the little collar that is supposed to fit over the handle where the metal band connects to the wood handle. Both units had the same flaw, and the collar will not stay affixed to the handle, so it rattles around on the flexible metal band that holds the rubber bonghead. The units work but this is an necessary flaw in the product, it's annoying, makes noise, and forces one to grasp the little collar with a finger so it stays put. This is a bit of a RIPOFF."
5,Why Not?,Gotta carry the canteen and cup in something. This is very good with a web belt or any other type of belt.
5,Canteen cover,"The cover is made of durable material. Came with clips to attach it to molle items or belts. The price was reasonable and I expect the cover to last as long as I do. The cover will hold the canteen a G.I. stove or canteen cup but not both. The cup can also be used for cooking as well as eating or drinking. Wound recommend the cover foe anyone carrying a one quart G.I. style canteen, aluminum or plastic ."
4,Tough little bugger,"I agree with previous reviews who commented that this thing is pretty much indestructible, and also that if you have any problems it will probably be with the snaps. Snapping becomes especially hard if you have a cup (or worse - cup and stove) stored below the canteen.One handy tip in hot weather - when refilling your canteen, get the cover soaked too. The evaporation will keep the water cool."
1,not so great,the music on this toy is very loud with no adjustment. also the key ring on top is poorly made making that part worthless. try the baby einstein mp3 player instead.
2,Flawed.,"The VTech Smart Key is a key shaped toy with four different buttons to push, which create loud obnoxious songs and sirens with no volume switch. There is a key ring on top with some cars that you can push around on it. My biggest gripe is with the ring. It does not function like a key ring should. A kid should be able to carry this toy by the ring and the key should dangle straight down. It is physically impossible to do this as the ring is too wide to go vertical in the slot provided on the top of the key. It doesn't even go up to a 45 angle.Little ones like to push buttons and make noise, I guess this has some value for doing that. It could have been better though."
5,Well-written overview of diseases,I bought this to prepare for the NCBTMB test and found this guide to be useful and HIGHLY readable as well! Well worth the money. I photocopied the back appendix and keep it in the office--a great reference!
3,Not completely satisfied...,"Although quite brief, I liked the introduction to the body systems prior to describing the pathologies. The CD includes answers to the review questions at the end of the chapters, as well as the pathology animations (although I wish there were more of them), and the student Q&A; for each chapter which are very helpeful.However, the book should have discussed specific massage techniques/strokes for each pathology, not just whether or not it is indicated/contraindicated. Also, the audio glossary is quite annoying."
5,good pathology book,"I have just scanned through the book so far, but it looks like a very good pathology book for massage therapists. It describes the relationship massage therapy has with different human pathologies (extremely important). I am a student and using the book for school right now, but I will continue to use this book for future reference when I am acually practicing medical massage."
4,a massage therapist's guide to pathology,the way this book is set up is simple and easy to read. the book gives wonderful information in a quick referance format along with a lengthier explanation for deeper understanding. this is great for the therapist who needs a simple overview of pathologies. i am happy to add it to my library!
4,School,Good detailed book for school. Very good photos of different diseases. Very informative on a vast amount of diseases and conditions.
1,misinformation,"As a Nationaly Certified Medical Massage Therapist with 20+ years in practice, this book disturbed me. While it is clear and conscise on many things, it's section on Fibromyalgia is disurbing, and makes me wonder what else she got wrong. Fibromyalgia is not a muscular disorder. It has widespread diffuse pain, but specific muscle pain is caused by Chronic Myofascial Pain Syndrome. Even though the two syndromes frequestly co-exist, they are not the same thing. Fibro sufferers often have significant reduction in the effeciency of the Lymphatic system, resulting in significant intersitial swelling etc. She lists only two references to a disease that affects 10% of the popluation. What this text does not mention is that a significant number of pathologies that are listed as ""contraindications"" respond well to massage therapy if the practitioner has had appropriate training in pathology specific techniques."
4,A Must,"I needed a Pathology book for the office, and found this under the USED category. The book is amazing, it gives info on what the condition is, whether certain massage protocols are effective, and easy to understand."
4,Useful,"Proven useful for my assignments for Cert IV Massage as well as for usage in practice. I like the layout with such subheadings for most pathologies as: Summary, Definition, Etiology, Signs & Symptoms, Complications, Treatment and Massage and Modality Recommendations."
4,M*A*S*H season ten,"I enjoyed every episode, especially the way the character's are ""bonding"" (ie. ""Hawkeye"", and Charles). The season ""finale"" was lacking the usual flair, (almost seemed like episode ""22"" was missing), but was still enjoyable."
5,Mash: all too true fiction,"This season is pithier than previous ones, which still have plenty to chew on. In light of our present miliary ""adventure"", the series is right on. I like it without the obnoxious laugh track."
1,Bad DVD disks!!! 5 times!!!,"We ordered Mash Season 10 from Amazon and so far have returned it 3 times. We're on our 4th set now and have the same problem. I can't believe others aren't writing about this problem. Disk 2 freezes up at exactly the same spot during the ""Birthday Girls"" episode. Since it happens in exactly the same spot it has to be the disks. Has anyone else had this problem?We're returning this to Amazon again and buying this season locally. Hope it's just a bad batch."
4,Australia is ahead...finally!,"Usually, we are about a year and a half behind dvd releases but for MASH Season 10, it was released earlier than usa and Season 11 is coming in early july as well...Season 10 was presented rather well but i do have 1 slight complaint about the artwork. there are numerous photos online taken aroudn the time of season 10(1981-1982) so why did fox use an old season 5 picture? Bj hasnt been without a moustache for over 4 seasons so why have it? The artwork on back and top is much more satisfactory, with contexual photos of Margret and Hawkeye. Apart from the slight complaint, the content is really good.. high quality soudns and picture."
2,The 4077th Overstays Its Welcome,"""M*A*S*H"" enters Season 10 in a state of continual decline - minus the serio-comic spontaneity of the Larry Gelbart era. Apart from the admirably offbeat ""Follies of the Living - Concerns of the Dead,"" the 1981-82 episodes are tired, repetitive and mostly unfunny. When Klinger gets promoted to sergeant, you realize the writers have finally run out of ideas. Little surprise that Season 11 was the long goodbye for a once-brilliant series."
4,MASH 10th Season,This DVD completed my MASH collection. I enjoy watching and rewatching this series. A must for the MASH Fan!!
5,outstanding,I purchased season ten along with season eleven for my husbands 60th birthday.Needless to say he loved them and thanks me each time he watches one of disks.I have found them to be very enjoyable with out all the commercials to break up the story.
2,"Good product, crappy shipping","I'm a big fan of mash, so if I had to rate the product, I would give it 5 stars. The seller, however, wrote the wrong darn address on it and it took about 3 times as long to get here as it should have. Proofread proofread proofread!!!"
5,There's a Boom Boom Boom in our Living Room!,"My 5 year old son loves Ralph's music and it is a treat to see him perform his songs along with the kids. Bought the video yesterday and he's watched it 3 times so far. I have no problem with my son singing, strumming along with and dancing to ""Ralph's World"". WAY cooler than Barney or the Wiggles...A previous reviewer commented on the lip syncing and poor production work. This video is recommended for ages 1 thru 8 who will not notice this one way or the other. The quality is in the music, the backgrounds and the kids who are having a great time dancing."
5,Excellent children's video,"Ralph's World Say Hello is an excellent children's video full of catchy songs, funny, children-oriented skits, and adorable dancers. This is a must have for any family with a young child."
2,"kind of neet, but battery life makes it impractacle to rely on","this is a very cool idea.. super tiny wrist watch PDA.. I love the concept, and I wanted to love this unit, but the short battery life makes it impossible to rely on. If you don't plug it in every night you run the risk of having it run out of juice and then you have to reload everything.. which is not too much of a chore I guess, but it is kind of.. if they could have gone the extra mile to use more modern flash memory it could have survived a power down just fine. So, because it's pretty much useless to me, I give it two stars. again, cool idea, poor implementation."
2,The Return Of Cheap Trick,"Fans of 70s arena rock will be pleased. Generally when the critics call something `power pop' they mean that it is boring, and Tsar is no objection. I agree that they sound like a modern version of Cheap Trick, but there's a reason Cheap isn't around anymore."
1,how low,"how low can you go, kids--these guys are a not-funny joke. a reason to give up listening to new music. derive, derive, derive seems to be their motto. i mean, do SOMETHING original on your debut. ransack your t.rex/bowie collection instead. such wannabes! oy vey!"
5,INSIDE THE BOY BRAIN! =) Loving the Tsar,"Tsar! Buy it and listen. Return to rock. Listen to the symphonies of So CAL beaches, occult choirs, starry mirages of tangled constellations, the harps of a few boys crazed imaginations. These leaders/saviors of Post-modern Youth, both innocent and raging, re-pave and break apart the crashing plains of their very own Creations, tumultuous worlds! Of chaos and life! God and Satan at battle in a disc of colors spinning just above the head! Without this album many bands to come would not be allowed to explore the forgotten pathologies of a larger people, a pathology of love enforcement, grace through destruction, hypnotic surges, monstrosity and technology. The fantasies these boys cultivate DO INDEED contain that mysterious power which is precisely FREEDOM'S, GOD'S and AMERICA'S - a mysterious power which gives THE KIDS a new direction, a light and a sound forever exciting to the flesh of the heart. (! )"
4,"Rock Pop and Punk, all rolled in one.","I bought this CD from the drummer of the band (Steve Coulter) and had him sign it. It was a live show with Injected and Marvelous 3 on November 11th, 2000 at Jack Rabbit's in Jacksovnille, Florida. This CD is pretty good. Awesome guitars and good pop lyrics. Songs like ""I Don't Wanna Break-Up"" set the high points of the band. The reason this band got 4 out of 5 stars is because the CD didn't catch the energy of the live show. It probably never could. The guys are pretty cool, they hung out with us before the show and after their set. I recommend buying the CD, and if you get a chance to see them live, do. They are fun to watch live."
5,TSAR saves the world of rock,"Have you ever taken to notice that the rock music today is alittle to blah. Well, TSAR has come to save the world of rock with outstanding lyrics crazy tunes. They would be no band like this in ages. This band is a great example of how to have fun but also pack a punch to the listener. If only music stations would give TSAR a chance they would love and play it none stop and it would get rid of all the poppy rock (NFG, Good Charrlotte, Simple plan etc etc except for Blink182). The song that got me hooked on to the TSAR was Teenwizards. So come on people join the silver shifter and lets go rock 'n' roll TSAR style!!!!!!!!"
5,how come i never heard of these guys . . .,"This album is incredible. I saw these guys rippin' it up touring with Social Distortion. Never heard of them and it was a great suprise when i ordered the album and got it. Pretty good the first listen, but I havent put it away since. Great music, fun, and hooked me in. Reccomend this album to anyone."
2,One Good Song,"I bought this for my husband's birthday because we both liked the song called ""Pure"" and we both were very disappointed. The rest of the music we don't like at all. Of course we just may be too old for this genre, but I think it's important to be able to understand the words in a song or what is the point of singing it! Christian music should be uplifting but you can't be encouraged when the words are not understandable! Maybe if I was a teenager I would like it better? The CD itself arrived in ""like new"" condition as promised."
4,You go girl!,"This cd is so empowering! Every song has some sort of ""you go, girl"" theme. I thought this was a Christian band, but the music varies. There is something here for any woman feeling any kind of pain, discouragement, self esteem issues, eating disorders, depression, everything bad we women feel."
2,A bit small.,"These are a nice quality-made pair of glasses, however, they are very small. The earpieces are too short for most adult males. They are more suitable for women with smaller facial features and for children. The nose bridge pads are also spaced far apart, even for a man's normal-sized nose... which would make them difficult for a woman or a child to wear. With a few changes, these could be a great pair of glove-box, purse, or jacket glasses as they are already quite compact. I'd give them 5-stars for quality, but gave them only 2-stars because they desperately need ergonomic testing on people."
5,reading glasses,"I like this reading glasses, that's a very practical purchase, They are very thin and I'm not afraid to break them with this kind of tube."
4,Woozy with Yorkston,"I heard the song Woozy with Cider from this album on NPR and fell in love with it. Granted, it is the best cut in my opinion, but I wouldnt say the other songs are not as good, they just dont have the same sly wit and vibe. This album is mostly quiet, relaxed and quite good. If you need your music to be a bit more obvious, try Alexi Murdoch, who I like, but with Yorkston, you have to let the subtlties work on you to really appreciate him."
3,"Gentle Voice and Quiet, Warm Melodies","James Yorkston has here a good album that has songs that are great to listen to during summer while you're out and about in your house. There are melancholic moments in ""I Awoke"", which has Yorkston self-examining his relationship with a former lover. ""Woozy With Cider"" is the excellent song that reminded me of some sort of slam poetry, but the spoken lyrics are embedded in an environment so real this song will take your breath away."
4,"Olympus Takes Great Pictures, Slow Shutter Speed","Read the manual! This is a great camera, but it's complicated scene modes make it a bit frustrating if you don't know EXACTLY what you're doing. The scene mode also resets every time you turn off the camera. The camera is ready to take pictures almost instantly after pushing the ""on"" button, but the focus and shutter speed make it hard to catch impromptu photos. People fall asleep waiting for the flash. The camera is durable but the LCD scratches easily. BUY A SCREEN PROTECTOR IMMEDIATELY! Excellent batterly life. Awesome review features and good balance of weight and size. This is not your Father's camera. It's high quality, durable, and portable camera. It takes great pictures...if you can figure out how to take them!Ryan"
1,"Good Pictures, Poor Quality","When I bought the camera I was impressed with the pictures it took. I found out after 4 years that it is a throw away camera. The lens will not close and all you get is a zoom error. I looked this problem up online and found that it is very common after a couple of years, and that it will cost the same to repair it as to buy a new one."
1,"Wish I would have...search ""card error"" for this camera on Yahoo!","Wow - I am so disappointed. I fell in love with this camera as I have with all my Olympus cameras in the past. However, this one only laster 8 months. If do a search on Yahoo! for ""olympus stylus 70 card error"", you will find the hundreds of other people that had the same issue I did. There is no fix, Olympus won't help - you are just out a camera."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA!,"Do NOT buy this camera. its horrible. you would think being an olympus camera and having 7.1 megapixels, it would be a good buy. BUT NO! it absolutely sucks. you take a picture of lets say a cabinet... you expect to see a cabinet - no. you see this jagged piece of crap thats like pupley-grey-white, instead of white. its so awful. im going to try to send mine back asap. and if i cant do that ill probably cry. and then sell it on ebay."
5,"Sonny James revisited,before he became a star.","This box is great,contains all of Sonny James studio recordings before he became a star.Hear how many styles of music Sonny tried before he found his trademark style.On the last cd you can hear Sonny has found the style that made him famous.It is all good great music,buy it you will not regret it.I guess Bear Family Records will release an cd box with Sonny James complete Capitol recordings where this cdbox ended in the near future."
4,Great book,"I've only tried one recipe so far, but it worked very well! This book is a bit limited in terms of what someone can make quickly-- who makes their own pasta anymore? Some of the recipes are quick, but some are too involved for me. To each his own. It's also very amusing to read, but I wish it had more illustrations of what I'm actually making (not just photographs of movie stars)."
5,the easiest and by far the best italian cookbook ever,"I lived with a very Italian aunt who made the best food, and for so many years I assumed that these recipes- lental soup, pasta fagioule, eggs with tomato sauce, pasta primavera etc were from hand me down recipes. To my surprise, after inquiring about how to make ""her tuna fingers,"" she handed me this book. It blew me away how simple and easy the recipes were. Really good Italian food! Its a shame that I bought so many Italian cookbooks trying to perfect these dishes when they were all right here. Dom Deluise adds personal stories which are a little sappy but still entertaining as well. It gives you something to read while your cooking dinner. Enjoy"
5,Our favorite cook book,We have used the book so many times that this is the third time that we have had to buy it.Greate Italian cooking.
1,Breathe free review,Absolutely useless. Wouldn't even go into my nose. Just hung on to the end of my nose. Prongs need to be extended so that they would at least go up into the nose.
3,Hopping Down the Path Toward Acceptance,"Phoebe the Rabbit accepts her younger brother Nathan who has autism. She explains some of his more overt behavior, yet at the same time makes it plain she loves him unconditionally.A cute, well-intentioned story for young children. The use of personified rabbits instead of people seems like a distancing technique. Still, it is just a nice little story."
4,X-Men Storm 2-Pack Action Figure,"A must for avid X-Men collectors and comic book fans. A must if you've collected the previous Famous Covers release of Storm. Unfortunately, the quality of these figures are far short of previous ToyBiz's action figure lines like Marvel Famous Covers. The white outfit of the comic Storm is a later outfit she sported in the '90s. Not as nice as her original black ""bathing suit"" type outfit, nor is the actual figure itself of the same quality unfortunately. The figures are fine for display or collection, but quality will fall short in the durability department, especially during actual child handling and play action. These are of limited production, which indicates that this was geared more to collectors than actually children. Bottomline, collectors and avid fans must get this set, but parents/kids should pass on these till ToyBiz puts out better representations of this popular characters."
3,Not for my cup,"This nutmeg is Indonesian. I'm not sure if that is what the problem is, but the Carribean nutmeg is different. Indonesian nutmeg is lighter in color and lighter in flavor. It's okay, but the Carribean nutmeg is richer in color, scent, and flavor. And it's crispier. That's important, because the softer Indonesian nutmeg doesn't work in my shaver. It's probably fine in any grinder, but not in my little shaver. The gripping spikes slip in the soft nut and you have to constantly fiddle with the nut to get shavings. If you don't know what a nutmeg shaver is, return your coffee maker for a refund and stick with Starbucks. I wound up with this product, probably for the same reason as a lot of you; it's the cheapest one. Well, you get what you pay for. It works, nothing wrong with it, but there are better quality products out there, and if you use a shaver, you really must pick one of the other options."
3,Tastes Good But No Safety Seal,"In fairness to the product itself, I did taste it and it does taste good. However, I couldn't get over the fact that there was no safety seal or tamper evident seal. I know I'm probably too paranoid, but in this day and age I like to see some type of safety seal on products I'm going to consume. I think that there should at least be a button that pops up when you open the bottle. But that's just me. The order came in 6 bottles. I didn't return them, because the next buyer would have absolutely no evidence that I opened one of the bottles. So it's a loss to me. Oh well, I guess it's one of the risks of ordering from the internet, not being able to inspect the packaging before purchase."
1,Still no safety seal -- dealbreaker for me,"I have to wonder about the leadership of this company. There's a review here from 2007 complaining about no safety seal and obviously no one at the company with the power to change that thinks it's a big deal. I bought this at my local grocery store. When I got home and opened it without the lid popping, I took it right back to the store and got my money back. I was going to call the company but there is no phone number on the label. Get this--it says if you have questions or comments about the product to WRITE to them. Ok, sure. Bet they don't get many questions or comments...which apparently is how they like it."
1,leaks CO2 after little use,Pretty lame for a Daisy. I have not used this pistol more than 20 times when the CO2 seal started leaking upon insertion.
3,Have to spend more money to get it to work....,"I couldnt believe this air pistol didnt come with a Co2 cartridge. I was extremely peeved. Why wouldnt you put at least one Co2 cartridge with the gun?? It doesnt even state that it has no Co2 come with it. The gun appeared to work fine...HOWEVER>>>>>> I returned it immediately for the simple fact I couldnt use it out of the box or wasnt informed by description that it didnt come with a cartridge. I would have ordered a box of cartridges at the same time if I knew. Well, this seller has lost my future business. Im tired of these companys short handing us consumers cause they can make an extra buck. The only reason I gave them a 3 star is because the gun looked good and worked...without actually shooting a bb."
3,"Decent, but shop around for others.","If you get this as a gift, don't be depressed, it's still an alright gun. It feels great in your hand, it's semi-auto, the CO2 holds really well and it's a powerful little gun. The drag about this gun is that it shoots slightly up and to the right. I haven't tried this gun with any scope, just the stock sight. Once you know where it shoots, it's easy to compensate, but just a hassle, ya know? The other drags are that it only takes BB's, not darts nor pellets and it doesn't use a clip/magazine, but rather you have to load it with a spring on the barrel. The flipside, it's decently priced for a 480 fps air gun (I haven't clocked it, but that's what the manufacturer says and it does seem to pack a wallop for an air handgun). In retrospect, I probably should have forked out another 10 bucks for the rifled Crosman 357W air pistol. Then again, those reviews also question accuracy (but at least you can use pellets)."
3,time thief,got it at $30 from walmart. powerful for the price. i wouldn't buy another one. the lack of exchangeable clips was my biggest turn off. dropping bbs in that little hole was not fun. the trigger was a little hard to pull but the loading time outweighs that by so much.
4,Daisy power line 15xt air pistol,I needed a BB gun to scare the cats away. The powerline is sufficient for the task. Has a nice sound upon firing that really gets their attention. Nice 15 bb load capability.
1,Save your money...,"I'm on my second Powerline 15XT pistol and I am experiencing the exact same problem as the first. There is a clear plastic seal where the CO2 cartridge nozzle fits in the handle and this seal is total garbage. This seal has now failed on two consecutive 15XTs. The company will send you additional seals when you call them but that is a sad way to do business - they should fix the design flaw. I use the pistol on occasion (about once or twice a week) but after the third CO2 cylinder you can throw it in the garbage. The pistol simply will not take the fourth cylinder - it will immediately leak when you try to insert a new cylinder displacing all the C02 into the air. Again, this is my second 15XT (less than one year old) with the exact same issue. I will not buy another."
5,Awesome Firepower!,"I bought the Powerline 15xt a little under a year ago and it's still shooting smoothly. My favorite part about this bb pistol is the firepower, 450 fps! It's accuracy is really good, I knocked a squirrel out of a tree at 30 yards out, and easily shattered stationary clay pigeons at 25 yards out. The only problem I have found with this bb pistol, is that you have to reload after 15 shots and the reloading process is very slow. Other than that, it's a very fine pistol."
1,Targeting way off and no way to adjust the sights,"Longer than normal trigger pull. But the biggest problem is it shoots quite high and to the right. Of course there is no sight adjustment so by aiming low and to the left should put you closer to 'on target'. It doesn't, the spread of the BB's still is very spread over target. I'm sending back."
3,"Ok gun, but annoyingly LONG trigger pull.",I would love this gun if it were not for the long trigger pull. I had a cousin that was 12 years old and could not get the trigger all the way back the first time. I could not either the first time. Also it is a c02 gun which I personally dont like.
1,DONT BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I would not ever recomend this to anybody I had it for 3 days and used 2 C02 cartriges then it started to get cold and the chamber split in 8 diffrent pieces
1,"no power, useless for any purpose","Using brand new 12g Crossman cartridge (only third ever loaded), I afterwards determined that 1st shot, temperature 68F, under maximum power, would NOT PENETRATE more than 1/16 inch of newspaper!! I wanted this for pest control; first shot only wounded, and I felt terrible. Even for target practice, the round would drop so much as to make it also useless for training. It is also difficult to load; holding back spring on tiny opening with one hand, trying to load BB's, dropping them all over, unless loading one at a time. Regret buying it and wish could return it. Will discard!"
4,Daisy air pistol,"This is a pretty good air pistol,it is fairly accurate. The only downfall is that it is made of cheap plastic. The trigger pull is terrible ,but it fits nice in your hand. You can load the c02 pretty fast. In other words it is a good pistol for its price."
4,Great gun but not the best,Ive had this pistol for almost 2 years now and it works great but its hard to load the bbs and shoots a little high or low depending how much co2 is left. I would recomend this gun to anyone
3,It bit the dust!,"As they say in the Old West, ""It bit the dust, Partner"".The pistol has remarkable power and is very accuracy (up to 30 feet) beyond that point you are better off tossing the shootin' iron at the intended target. This lack of accuracy does not affect the power, it still has quite a pop beyond the point of accuracy loss. The trigger pull is poorly designed (tragic) and the release point is where the problems begin. It hesitates causing the need for more pressure an instability with the target focus.The ""magazine"" design is a joke. I devised a nice little gadget to hold it open as I filled the tray but even then there were failures. The other day I attempted to load the little guy, the magazine slide kept coming free and slamming shut, so I simply dropped the little gun in the trash.I would say if you have the patience to deal with the magazine slide, squeeze the trigger steady and remain close to your target then this little gun will do fine.J. Mannion"
3,Mis-stated muzzle velocity,"The manual says 425fps, the description here says 480fps. Download the manual and see for yourself. The gun is a real pain to load, the magazine is built in and has a slide which is difficult to hold open when loading. If the slide had a bit of an extension, you could at least more easily hold the slide open. It will take you longer to fully load than it will to fire out the magazine.Other than that, it's a good BB gun, seems accurate enough, and is a good size, very comfortable to hold and shoot."
1,Spring issue,"The Spring broke on the inside of the magazine, just in time for the 30 day return so I threw it out! Oh well. I'll get a new one that is worth it!"
1,daisy 15xt,mine was ok the first few times i shot it and after that it was s*** the peircing screw broke it was inacurate as hell i regreted spending money on it i recomend a crossman c11 or umarex or somthing
5,Tribute to those who fought the good fight.,"This is a fabulous story, and basically so true! It is a tribute to all of those in uniform and out who fought Liberty's enemies throughout the world. Having played a modest part in hot and warm aspects of the ""Cold"" war, it reads like a vindication of all our efforts. We won! It should be a must read for everyone who followed the evnts of the ""Cold"" war, and for those too young to remember but need to be reminded that ours too was a ""greatest"" generation."
1,He forgot the United Fruit Company,The USA overthrow democratically elected governments for their own interests. In the case of Guatemala in 1954 to protect the United Fruit company. You call it fighting for freedom. Guatemalans call it terrorism.
3,Good introduction to improve your health,"This is a very basic introduction to the subject for people who are totally unfamiliar with health disorders like Leaky Gut, Candida, Parasites, etc.. It gives you a good base to start with for proper health and encourages you to seek out help from a licensed alternative care practitioner. If you've read other books or have a pretty good understanding of these subjects already do not buy this book because you will not learn anything new here. If your new to this subject matter and are looking for an alternative to traditional medicine this is a decent book to start with."
4,very good general digital camera,"This is my second general use digital camera, replacing a five year old Olympus which just became too slow between pictures, a software problem which I could not solve.HP has developed an excellent camera in that all the options are available in the software of the camera itself. No more carrying the instructions book and frantically trying to find how to perform some functions. Now one can frantically go throgh all the steps on the screen until the function is found.So far I am satisfied with the camera, I have not used it long enough to run out of battery and I bought a spare to keep with me at all times when that does happen. The memory in the camera is inadequate except for an emergency, but a 2 Gig card has taken care of that.I have not gotten used to using to screen for shooting pictures as yet, I hope that by the end of vacation this month I have mastered the techniques for doing that. Too many years of shooting through a lens finder."
4,good camera,"Good camera, but i like more the Casio exilim Z80.overall is a decent camera for the price."
4,Great Camera!!,"I Love my camera, it was a Mother's Day gift! It has alot of nice features and takes Great pictures!! The only thing I don't like is that it is Very delicate. You really have to be very gentle with it! Not one that you want to leave laying around....This is a camera that you want to keep in the case until you want to use it....Well, I am Enjoying taking lots of pictures with it and HP is a great company to deal with for any of there products and Customer Service......."
3,Great for beginners.,"The reason I chose this one was b/c of the ease of use and potential quality pictures. The camera itself can be like a fun hands on instruction manual in photography. Very easy to understand and learn from. Overall i am only satisfied with the knowledge gained. Although the camera has the potential to take great shots (and i have taken a few that people dont even beleive was done with this camera)it doesnt satisfy my expectations. The docking station is a pain in the butt and the camera now takes me over 12 hours to charge. It only works when it wants to (the camera, and the docking station). At one point i wanted to find a waterproof casing and found it close to impossible. The casing i found was a waste of money. After just over a year of use for business purposes (taking people on hikes through Kilauea Volcano to view LAVA up close and personal in Hawaii) i am now ready for an upgrade. Considering the 10 mp G7 by Canon..."
5,"Great pictures, easy to use","As soon as you charge the battery for the first time, you can take a picture. The quick start guide has all the information you need to perform all the common tasks with the camera. You can use the camera as a simple point and shoot, or take advantage of all its features. You can snap pictures less than 2 seconds apart. Great clarity until you reduce the megapixels too much with the digital zoom, but the camera tells you what your current mp level is, so you can monitor the quality before you snap. I recommend an extra battery and a card with plenty of extra memory so you can snap unlimited photos then pick and choose later. Only drawback is that the latch for the battery/memory door requires some dexterity to open and close. If you have clumsy fingers, you'll want to try to open the latch on a demo before you buy it. Also read my comment on Scott Rose's review."
4,Good Point & Shoot,"I've owned this camera for a couple of months and love it. Good pictures, small enough to slip in a pocket. Has great learning tools built in for beginners.You DO NOT need a dock to download pictures to your PC. All you need is the standard USB cable provided with the camera.I agree there is some awkwardness in the design. It is easy to put your finger over the flash. Like a lot of the newer cameras, no manual view finder which is too bad. They come in handy in certain lighting conditions."
5,Love this Camera,"Very happy with this camera. Great deal, great price, love the features.I'm a very experienced hobbyest. I also have a Nikon D-70S. I bought this camera to always have a camera on me that's small and light.The features on this camera are fantastic, the big viewing screen, stabilizing, etc., and it's very user friendly. You'll figure out how to use it in no time even if you're inexperienced in using a digital camera. You just can't beat it for the price."
4,Fun Camera,"First, I want to complement Amazon on their speedy delivery of this camera. I ordered the camera one morning and received it the next day. Now that is service.Now for the camera, I bought it as a gift for a first time digital camera user and I have to say the camera not only is easy to use but fun. I almost kept the camera for myself. The picture quality is a lot better than I expected. The pictures are very clear and sharp. The camera is used mainly indoors at family get togethers and I haven't seen a bad picture yet.If you are looking for a small camera that is easy to use and takes good pictures this camera is for you. It also has some fun photo imaging that you can play with on the camera however I have noticed it drains the battery fairly quickly. Overall I would recommend this camera."
3,Doesn't take good night pictures,"I had gotten this HP camera a few years ago for a gift, And it worked great and liked playing with it. I have had to replace the battery 2 times now. And only charges on the charger. Takes good pictures in bright light and outside. But doesnt take good pictures in low light and takes a half of a minute only to get blurry pics!! Thats where I get annoyed because after playing around with the setting many many times, I still cant get night pics or pics in lower light!!"
2,Gameboy Jeopardy,"I was thrilled to purchase this game for our family to play during holiday travel in the car. We are big jeopardy fans. We were disappointed in this game. The questions are not hard, but typing the answers in during the alloted time is nearly impossible. It is frustrating. The controls are so sensitive that you are forever typing the wrong letters in. Correcting the mistakes take so long that your time runs out before you have a chance to correct them. It would work better with multiple choice answers!"
4,Experienced Gamer,"Jeopardy was really fun and challenging. I recomend to everyone, especially smart people."
2,Wish It Had Been Better,Tracking was all off and barely watchable. Not in as good of condition as advertised.
4,"Man, Sage is Incredible...","I now have every bit of matierial ever release by Sage Francis. I just find this Man to be an amazing rapper/poet. Now, this album is not his best album. As wierd as it is, the best collection of songs i've heard from him is probly ""Sick of Waging War"", witch is not an album, and is more of a mixtape. But, this album, being on a bigger label than his two past efforts, and of coarse, he, and the people have more expirience. This album has a more ""professional"" sound. And I i'm not really sure how to explain it, but that's the best way to explain it. I think every body should check out any thing by him. I'm not guarenteeing you'll like him, but you should a little try him out... weather it's through this album, or or any thing else by him, you will be equally impressed by him in any form..."
1,Nerd Rap at its sissyness,"Sage Francis is nothing more than a nerd rapper. After his recent acts toward Necro and UGHH, he has committed career suicide.But back to the review. The beats are weak as heck. I guess he couldn't get any real production. His lyrics are blabber. No substance."
4,Great...,"don't get me wrong, this album is excellent. The music is inspired and interesting and the lyrics and flow are getting better with each album. But this is nowhere near as great as ""Personal Journeys"", which is one of the most personal and brilliant underground hip hop albums ever released. No matter what Sage does, I will always compare his future efforts to that masterwork. In fact this labum isn't as good as the Non Prophets ""Hope"" or any of his previous ""bootleg"" releases, but because it's Sage, you will love this CD. But I recommend getting the early stuff as well."
4,It's a different side of sage,"This cd, though very good and highly listened to by me in the past day (i got it today), is not as good as Personal Journals. Note I did not say it was bad, because it is really really good... you just can't compare it to personal journals, that was more or less the 'The Wall' of sage francis. If you are a sage Francis fan or just an underground indie hip hop junkie, you SHOULD BUY THIS ALBUM!!!! Sage takes a political side on this album, and it seems he's evolving into something that has forgotten his roots. The beats are a ton better than anything you've heard by Sage Francis before (for the most part), and instead of giving his spittin' his emotions, he spits his values. Best songs on this album are Sea Lion and Bridle. Dance Monkey has an extremely haunting chorus that you can't get out of your head."
1,More Faux Hip-Hop From Epitaph,"Just like most of the other Rhymesayers artists, Sage creates hip hop which is really intended for people who normally don't listen to hip hop.On this album you will find lackluster production with a bunch of frantic talking (not rapping, not rhyming, but TALKING) about the government. There is really not much focus on making the beats catchy or any concept of having the lyrics flow.This is by no means ""hip hop"". This is the typcial Punk-Hop pushed by epitaph.Some may say this is ""creative"", but I'd call it PRETENTIOUS and CORNY."
5,my pup loves it,My Dalmatian loves this food and it's suppose to be great for her because of the low protein content and no preservatives.
5,Unsung Heroes,"This well-written books adds much to a little known asepct of World War II in the Pacific. It tells how a small group of individuals risked their lives daily on Japanese held islands in the Solomons. Their mission was not to fight but to observe and report. The reports they provided did much to help American efforts on Guadacanal and the seizing of other islands in the area. They received little publicity after the war and little support during it but they did a magnificent job. They reported enemy ship movements, aircraft attacks, and troop locations and movements. They saved downed fliers and sailors (including JFK when PT109 was rammed and sank)and led civilians to saftey from behind enemy lines. Mr Lord's book puts a spotlight on a small group of real heroes, many of whom received little or no recognition."
1,Totally Dis-satisfied,"I ordered pistol grips for my S&W Bodyguard Model 49 and they sent me grips for a Rugar Redhawk 44 Mag. I have tried numerous times to contact the company to exchange for the proper gribs and they never got back to me. I also attempted to call them, but you only get an answering machine. I left several messages and they never returned a call. I would not recommend this company to anybody. I'm not trying to get my money back, just the correct item I ordered."
3,"Needs a little work, but so far so good",Recently I installed a Hatori SB-15FH on my Raptor. This is a 50 to 70 size muffler. I will need several flights on it to do a full review but one thing I wanted to mention is that with this and the Curtis Muscle Pipe 2 you need to cut the canopy so it will clear. I had a strange problem on my R50v2 recently. I found the bottom brass ring of the autorotation hub had moved down and was dragging on the snap rings.Looks like my TT50 has developed some slop in the rear bearing after 500 tanks. I put a used TT50 I bought a year ago in it but did have the local bearing shop order a front and rear bearing for it (just $3.50 each) and should have the engine back running great again.
3,Questionable Reference Causes Doubt,"On page 19, under the heading of Selective Perception and Communication, the authors indicate that ""research"" has shown that grades received by teachers reveal bias of the teacher as opposed to the actual level of knowledge of the child. Two specific examples are provided but WITHOUT citation to the supposed research. Since the research material is so well documented in the rest of the book, I question why they did not make the citation available here. I would like to read this research but am left without the option to find it myself. Ironically, my view of everything that I read in this book from this point on will be tarnished by this experience."
2,Less than mediocre crossover,"With all the countless DC/Dark Horse crossovers over the years, Superman VS The Terminator, as the previous reviewer had stated, was practically inevitable. The storyline picks up after the events of the Terminator 2 film, with Sarah and John Connor in Metropolis on the run from the Skynet sent time traveling terminators. Eventually, Superman is on the scene, protecting Sarah and John, and he is joined by Supergirl, Suberboy, and Steel. Lex Luthor is on the scene as well, with his own ulterior motives of course, leading up to a twist ending. Alan Grant's script has plenty of plot holes and some real bad cheesy dialogue (especially at the end between Supes, Sarah, and Lois Lane), but the plot twists and solid art save this book from being a total stinker. All in all, this is worth a look for crossover fans, but it's far from being anything special."
4,Waited a long time,"I always loved the song ""1900 Yesterday"" but could not find it anywhere, including the on-line music services. When I received the CD I was a little disappointed because I didn't see any other originals besides 1900. They were all covers of other artist's songs. Then I listened and have to say I was very pleased with their renditions and found a number of them that I thought much better than the versions done by other artists. All in all. It's worth the price. Good listening."
4,Nice mastering,This CD sounds very nice and the mastering was well done. The music is mostly 'easy listening' vocals with a large number of 'covers' of popular songs of the day (early 70's).
4,When EMS is in your heart,"Reading Pat's book was like reading a story about not only myself, but many of the people I've met through my involvement in rural EMS. How many people can say that they volunteer because EMS is in their heart? When I first started I was so unsure of why I got involved, only I knew there was an empty place in my heart that needed to be filled, and now I can't imagine what life would be like without it! It's such a wonderful feeling to be there for a ""save"", or to see someone on the street and have them thank you for being there when they needed you desperately, and knowing you were there because it's where your heart has led you."
5,Simply enjoyed it!,"I purchased this, with a little hesitation at first. I thought that maybe it would just be a book about what someone dealt with at home, not on the job. I was wrong.Pat Ivey did an amazing job of describing exactly what it is like to be in EMS. Regardless if your an EMT, Paramedic (CT as she describes it), volunteer or paid, I feel she nailed it. Between dealing with emotions with certain calls and patients, to having to work with your family about something you love and want to do, help others, this book covered it all. I was very pleased with reading it and would recommend to anyone. I admit there were a few times where I became lost and not sure what was going on. For example, she's talking about an incident that happened that was good, and showed how humans can be decent to each other, and caring; But the very next paragraph it talks about a guy hanging himself. It threw me off, but still kept me intrigued and glued to my kindle until I was done."
5,An excellent look at rural volunteer rescue squads!!,"I enjoyed reading every page of this book, it paints the picture of what EMS is about outside of the big city. After years of service in EMS in a rural area I can relate with the stories told in this book. Rich says this book is boring and doesn't have enough stories, but I disagree, I think it is pretty similar to my experiences in EMS. This book is not about the thrills, it is about the human stories, and that is what EMS is about."
2,Another Bomb,"Another bomb. I'm an EMT in one of the top rated systems in the world. This book, is not the best I've read. Although Pat and Ed are outstanding EMT's, they make the job sound like you just drive there, get on-scene and be a cowboy. I disagree with the reputation they give all public safety personnel."
1,Can you say clueless,"I recall reading this book during a shift after my wife bought it for me. Of course I wasn't a real volunteer wannabe like Pat, but I did have 15 years of real life urban/suburban Paramedic experience. This women is/was/has been nd her clueless approach to what real EMS is is a frigging slap in the face to those of us that made this our profession, not our ""feel good"" past-time. I threw the book out of the window!"
1,"Save your money, Don't read this book about saving lives.","This book was horrible. As a paramedic, I know ALL EMT's have a few stories to tell. Pat Ivey has a few stories to tell but hers are all boring and exaggerated to make her and her rescue squad look good. This book was slow reading and not at all exciting. Ms. Ivey is just trying to cash in on the publics fascination with EMS."
1,i want my money back!,"one of my aged aunts thought i would like this for my birthday, 1st look at the cover and i thought ""this looks ok"" but what a load of piss! they chopped down a tree to make this crap?there should be a law against killing tress to print this sort of waste of paper, the wtiter obviously knows nothing about reggae or seemingly much else and i have seen better photos in a family album!"
4,My Favorite Author,This book was really good. I read it when i was in 4th grade. I would recomand this book to anyone who likes andventures. The illistrations where very good. It was about a girl stuck on a island with out her parents. While she is on the island she trys to figure out where her parents are. But i thought this book was really good.
4,Nim's Island for Grown-ups,"I read this book because Gerard Butler will star in the movie. But I have to say, I enjoyed the book. I finished it in 2 hours and think it's a cute story. While the chances of this adventure really happening are slim, the premise makes a good story. Dad gets lost at sea and Nim is stranded on an island alone. She must cope with day-to-day living - feeding herself, daily chores, etc. Hmmm, would a child really eat radishes for lunch? I think Wendy Orr is a really good children's author. I passed the book on to my 10 year old granddaughter who loved it. She was sad when it ended, and said she wants MORE NIM. She was thrilled when I told her that there will be ""Nim at Sea"" coming next year. While I will go to see the movie because of Gerard Butler, I will enjoy seeing how they interpret Nim's buddies, the sea lion, the iguana, and the turtle."
5,Cute and fun,"I adored this book. Nim is cute, sweet, and incredibly resourceful. Her island is wonderful and she has lovable animal friends that she plays with. Basically Wendy Orr has written a book about my fantasy life..."
5,Excellent Gift!,"I gave this to my 8 year old grandson for Christmas. He absolutely loved it and got to playing with it immediately. In just minutes he was showing me designs he had made. The pieces join together very easily and stay together. If you are looking for that special gift, this just might be it!"
4,Better late than Dead,"I've never been a ""Dead Head"". Had no desire to see them in concert and never bought an album...until now. I was listening to the ""Classic Rock"" radio station when ""Ripple"" came on. I was humming it to myself thinking, "" What a great tune this is"". I logged on to my favorite on-line music source and checked out the selections and decided that it's time to chuck my attitude. Sure it's entertaining to make fun of Dead Heads, but This is a band that was an instrumental part of the sixties and not to be overlooked. I was amazed at how much I enjoyed hearing all those cherries, aside from ""Touch Of Gray"" I like every song on the disc. I think this is the must-have choice for anyone who's NOT a Dead-Head, but still likes their tunes."
3,Some of the best.,"Like all albums, there are a mix of songs; some you will like more than others. I am sure there are deadheads that like it more than I did."
2,Overated,"Ok to start off, I'm probably going to make a lot of dead fans mad with this review but someone had to say something. The Grateful Dead are overated. Ok so there is a couple good songs on here like Sugar Magnolia and Touch of Grey but the rest is kind of boring. I wouldn't go out and spend 15 or 16 dollars on this but it does make an interesting library rental."
4,Good Intro to the Dead,"""Best of"" collections can sometimes disappoint, but in the case of the Grateful Dead, this is the best way for the non-Deadhead to experience them. As a band, the Dead were not always consistently good song-writers (their fame is based on their live shows, not their albums), so apart from ""American Beauty,"" there really is no one record that is going to blow away the casual listener. However, this is a solid collection that contains many of the band's best songs, as well as most of their hits. I give it 4 instead of 5 stars because certain obvious inclusions are absent. For instance, where is ""Alabama Getaway,"" or ""I Need a Miracle""? I am old enough to remember these songs getting tons of airplay on FM stations, so they certainly qualify as ""hits."" Still, a fine introduction to a great American band."
3,Like it alot,"It is great car music. Not ""jammy"" so I don't have to worry about breaking into dance while driving! Would be better if it did have a live tune or two."
5,The only STUDIO album you need,"I hear alot of people complaining about how so many songs are missing and how you don't get enough live tracks. Who cares? Listen, who honestly wants studio versions of songs that were taken off like ""Dark Star"" and ""China Cat Sunflower"". If you are a new Dead fan buy this studio album only, however, get ALL of their live stuff. That is what's important. If your a true DeadHead though, buy all their studio albums and live albums and forget this.One thing I will say though is that this collection is MUCH better than the other ""Skeletons In The Closet"" collection.Anyway, just buy this. It's awesome. Peace."
4,The best single disc collection.,"This is a big improvement over ""Skeletons from the Closet"", and a good set for the casual fan. Besides being remastered, this also has 6 more tracks than the old ""best of"". This does include the big hits ""Truckin'"", ""Uncle John's Band"", and ""Friend of the Devil"", BUT also has ""Fire on the Mountain"", ""Ripple"", and ""Touch of Grey"". Obviously many songs are missing like ""Scarlet Begonias"" and ""Throwing Stones"", but it is only one disc. However there is the old 2-disc best of ""What a Long Strange Trip it's Been"". Whatever you decide on, play ""Dead""."
3,Not Just For Neophytes,"While it might come as a shock to many, there is a group of older people, who took their fair share of mind altering substances, who just were not big fans of the Dead.Personally,I always found them to be lacking a competent vocalist,an above average instrumentalist, and found their extended jams somewhat snooze enducing.This is not to say however,that they were totally incapable of some decent songwriting on occasion. Rhino has managed to compile the best of these recordings on this CD. While the flaws mentioned above are certainly evident on these tracks, the songwriting is strong enough to still cause them to be relevent.And the remastered sound quality is very nice indeed.A good CD for those who want a taste of the Dead in their record collection, but dont want to mull through the rest of their stuff to collect the better songs. I own this, and Blues For Allah, thats as dead as I care to be."
3,Not so Grateful,I bought this for my husband. I didn't like it very much but he seems well satisfied.
5,The Dead Are Alive,"I'm not a collector of the Dead but I have heard various recordings from them, read the reviews on here and loved this collection of songs. Some think they are not talented, come on, if your around as long as they have been then they did something right! I do believe they never had the hits and were more popular ""Live"" then their studio albums but this is a good look into this band. It also has tracks from different labels which makes this the most complete collection available. So if your music listener looking for something different but yet intriguingly different then the regular bands out there (this band is better then anything coming from Britney Spears folks!)then, give it a try, like I say, not a Dead collector but just a casual listener of their music. Check it out, a mix of rock/country.Check my site out sometime @ ""JudeMac Forever"" & say ""Hi""."
4,An excellent twist of a classic!,"This is definitely an excellent variation of the classic Final Fantasy series. In this Zelda-style rendition, players may customise their main character in several ways to lean toward brute strength, magic, weapon technique, defense, or any combination of the above. The game is challenging and absorbing, and definitely a must for any RPG fan!"
3,can't get past where they leave you,"This game is fun at first, and the instruction booklet gets you to a certin point. Then they leave you to your own devices, it loses the fun. I still can't find out how to get past it."
3,BEWARE if buying for IPOD INTERFACE,"One of the main reasons for buying this system was for the IPod interface, which generally got quite positive reviews. However, when I hooked up my new 80GB IPod (40% full), I found the scrolling speed impossibly slow! Not just bothersome slow, but UNUSABLE slow.So, if you plan on using this with the Ipod interface, and have visions of scrolling though a long list of artists while watching the Ipod display on your TV, beware. I spoke to Denon US, and they were aware of the problem. However, they say they have no solution and are not aware of any fixes coming out any time soon. In fact, the tech. I spoke to blames the problem on Apple. If so, any fix may be a long time coming, if ever.Since Apple's scrolling feature is MUCH faster (especially the latest software version), I guess I will have to resort back to my old Apple dock and lose the TV/Denon interface."
2,Close But No Cigar,"I purchased this system in December and found it to be less than anticipated. The passive woofer is exactly that: Too passive and is, in many instances, non existent. Having come from owning a Yamaha/Klipch system (which I gave to my son-in-law and boy am I sorry now!) and looking for something more compact, the Denon falls considerably short of what I am used to. Picture quality was not an issue to begin with as I coupled the Denon with a 40"" Sony LCD. If you are particular in terms of the sound you desire in home audio look elsewhere. the Denon, especially for the price, is not even close to what you're looking for."
1,Do not buy Denon,These units apparently have a fatal flaw in them. Many owners have had the units for a period of time - usually longer than the warranty only to find out there is a problem that eventually prevents the unit from playing CD's. No support for something that was just plain poorly designed. This is my 4 and last Denon product.
1,AVOID Denon,"I purchased this unit back in 2005. I was quite happy with the setup and the sound. A great home theatre system; even though it is only a 2.1 system.I have had what I consider two (2) major issues which are obvious factory defaults:1. When viewing DVD's the screen will go blank for about 5 seconds about every 30 minutes. This should not happen and is not overly annoying... but for a system which cost you $1,600... Should this happen?2. Late last year the CD player became inoperable. When audio cd's are inserted, the time stamp should be displayed... instead all i get are zero's... and no CD will play.I have researched these issues and have found them to be quite common by other s-301 ownersThis unit has been discontinued and updated with another unit..I have called Denon several times and have received nothing but a run around.... so I will recommend to all:<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<DO NOT BUY DENON PRODUCTS>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Support is nonexistent."
1,Denon S-301,Similar to others I experienced the intermittent loss of the DVD signal. This occurred with 2 different units. Denon support was difficult to contact and the retailer (Vanns) would do nothing more than take the return. I won't buy Denon or from Vanns again.
2,"disfunctional with hdmi, and denon repair is unreachable","Maybe the other reviewers are denon employees. That's the only way I can explain the high ratings, and the absence of complaints about an issue that is reported on many other websites. When using hdmi, the screen will occasionally go black for about three seconds. When you're watching a movie, that's really annoying. And if you hope to have it fixed, better clear a week on your calendar, because denon repair is impossible to reach."
4,gorgeous deal,"I found the action figures detailed, fully articulated, impeccably dressed.The only drawback is that the right hand wrists in both action figures' are not open to hold any weapon.It was a super deal."
4,A fresh take on rock from the UK,"These guys are really quite excellent. Though this EP is short, the four songs present a varied and creative take on rock that differs from the brit-pop scene at present, and brings to mind current American indie favs Wolf Parade and Clap Your Hands Say Yeah. Definitely worth the price to get in on the ground floor with these guys, they should be big."
4,okay...,"I wasn't sure whether to give this a 3 or a 4, but I gave it a 4 because it really was interesting enough that I got through it quickly (if something takes me a while to read, it's either very long or not very interesting). Yota is still dealing with relationship problems, only now his problems don't involve the word ""dateless"". In fact, he's got way too many women in his life. There's Moemi, Nobuko, and Ai. Yota's dating Nobuko, but he still loves Ai, and he's still got feelings for Moemi. It makes his life pretty complicated. The reason I was wondering if I should give it a 3 was because I'm getting to the point in this series where I think every one of these characters just needs a break from each other - or maybe just from Yota. It's hard to believe that he could go from being the guy with the nickname ""Dateless"" to the guy that every girl wants to have. This book still was a pretty good read, but I don't think I'm going to be continuing with this series anytime soon."
1,I learned my lesson...not worth it,"I'm sure you've all heard the expression ""Don't judge a book by it's cover"". Well that's just what I did this time and it was a mistake. It was the title that fooled me. I am a person with disabilities and I hated being called special as a kid. Now I'm a childcare professional for children with and without disabilities and I thought this book might come in handy. Unfourtunately I found it very disapointing. The information is way too general and there's no real story. There's no central character or plotline for the intended audience (preschool/early elementary) to relate to. When I was asked to read this book to an inclusive kindergarten class, I completely lost their attention after 3 pages. I honestly found the book to be a little patronizing for them and for me. (especially the ""how to use this book"" page in the back)There are much better children's books out there about disabilities. Don't waste your money on this one."
3,"Ok, but doesn't quite live up to its title","I recently took the AP boards and used this book in my preparation. Although using this book does help in overall review of AP topics and identifies areas of weakness, there are several problems with this book. First, the questions do not follow the same format as the questions on the real board exam. Second, as with any multi-author textbook, some chapters are better than others. Third, there are many topics and questions in AP on the real exam that are not covered in this book. The explanations to the questions are pretty good and are quite helpful. In summary, this book is good practice, but don't be too reliant on it and don't expect it to cover everything on the AP boards."
4,5stars,"my daughter and I love gameboy pocket games there are so many games to choose from and they are very convenient to play wherever, and whenever."
1,Ego trip versus Instructional Guide,"I was extremely dissappointed to find that this book was more about the authors, than about instructional tips on how to windsurf. As a beginner I was looking for some text to assist in the art of tacking/gybing etc. There are approx 2-3 pages that deal with tips and lessons, all others are just groovy pictures and unrelated comments made by the authors. My recommendation is stay clear of this one."
2,Not the book Advertised,"Don't be fooled, this book is not written by Josh Stone and Jason Polalow, it has been been written by Nik Baker and Daida Ruano Morneo. I admit they are two well renouned windsurfers but not the advertised people.The content is ok but no more than is provided in the average winsufing magazine. Definately for the beginner or intermediate windsurfer.Some interesting comments about gybing, freestyle manouvers and wave riding but not in depth enough to really tell you how to do them, just a basic outline."
2,Nokia 6235i/6236i ACP-12U OEM Travel Charger,It did not charge my cell phone even though I had it on charge all night. I checked the voltage output and it was 20% below the charger that came with my cell phone. It is a throw away.
2,"""Bad"" Indeed","I'm sure like everyone else I picked this up because I'm a big fan of Lost. And what started out as a solid read and a few teases - a ""Hanso Foundation"" here and a ""John Locke"" there just digressed into an average (at best) book.The writing isn't very strong (the 'love making' and mention of more 'love making' three-quarters of the way through will make you blush - and not because of the content). And conveniently the main character's best friend is an retired English Lit. teacher that always has a book/reference to mention (with the subtly of an anvil hitting you over the head).You know you're in trouble when everything is over explained between the characters in the last 2-3 pages.Loved the season finale of Lost... can't say the same about this book."
2,Not worth it,"As a mystery novel it's poorly written and as a tie-in to the show, it's quite dissapointing, it just misleads you from the real experience of watching ""Lost"" -which I consider myself a huge fan of-, predictable storyline, no plot twists nor interesting characters and the only references to the show are scarce and seem placed only as small winks to the reader. Stick to basics and watch only the great show, don't waste your money."
2,What does this have to do with LOST?,"I am a huge fan of LOST and I know the place of the Gary Troup manuscript in the series and his relationship with Cindy and all....but this is just a bad book about a bad twin and if it has much meaningful to do with LOST or even remotely with the themes of LOST then it escapes me. Readers would do better to flip through this book before buying it and write down all the other books mentioned in it and go read those instead of this one. Sawyer would most definitely not like this book and I'm sure could find a familiar alternate (twin) use of it, especially while stranded on an island."
2,"""Bad Twin"" should be an anagram for ""Bad Read""","Well, this is a story that's total hype is on its connection to Lost. I mean, that's mainly why I bought it- as did all of us. But, as reviews have stated, even knowing the importance of the name Widmore from the finale its connection was extremely feble. It had quite nothing to to with lost, honestly. Also, contrary to the praise given in the preface, it was an ironic and symbolic book to some extent- but really just a mystery that was less of a mystery than just one giant chase. It was also fairly porely written with a hero that has no reason or skill as a detective and just kind of thinks and comes up with no answers. Paul Artisan is not one you especially root for or even much care about. But the most disturbing thing is the fact that it had an fairly extreme amount of profanity- most of the words starting with ""F""- and sexual innuendo and content. This is pretty dissapointing, and only really a read for someone with too much time on their hands."
2,Average Mystery Using Lost,"I get it - one of the writers of Lost wrote a mystery novel years ago that he or she couldn't sell. So, Lost made it happen after all. Very ordinary mystery story with some modestly interesting twists and turns. Is it the bad twin, the father, the step-mother, the butler...not enough here to really care."
3,"Doesn't contain much Lost references, but still a nice read in its own right.","In ""Bad Twin"" by fictional author Gary Troup(in actuality written by ghostwriter Laurence Shames), the story is about a small time detective named Paul Artisan who gets involved in a large case when he's commissioned to find the identical twin of a rich heir. Things aren't as they seem, and the book contains standard twists, such as who the ""Bad Twin"" really is.The Hanso Foundation, Alvar Hanso, and Thomas Mittelwerk are only briefly mentioned in the story, disappointing some fans hoping for more of the Lost tie-in. Despite this, it's an enjoyable novel in its own right out of a library, but isn't worth buying."
2,lower your expectations... and lower them again,"I bought this book because of the Lost tie-in. I was expecting more than a couple of shared names and events. I read this book on a 5 hour flight and the fact that I was anchored to my seat really helped. The book is a pleasant diversion, an entertaining story, but without the tie-in to Lost it probably would have been published directly to paperback.For Lost fans, lower your expectations, then take a deep breath and lower them again before reading this book."
2,"Great premise, cliched delivery","I was expecting a really great story when I bought this book. I've been watching the TV show Lost since it first aired, and I thought that reading this book would be a fun way to find some tidbits and clues about the backstory of the television program.While the story was mildly interesting, the pages were filled with cliches and poor delivery. I would have bene much happier with the book if I had known that prior to buying it. I still would have purchased the book because of its connection to the television show, but I wouldn't have been expecting a well told mystery to come with the package."
3,"Not so ""Bad"" after all...","""Bad Twin"" succeeds where most other ""Lost"" tie-ins so far have failed: it's actually entertaining! The story is a missing person/murder mystery written by the fictional character ""Gary Troup"" (an anagram for ""purgatory""), who was supposedly aboard Oceanic flight 815 when it crashed on that mysterious island. The tale is nicely crafted, if a bit predictable, and the characters are all rich and amusing (if at times cliched). This novel reads easily, clips right along, and I would recomend it even to non ""Lost"" fans."
5,Bad Twin is a fun read,"Enjoyed this book immensely. Too bad the author's plane crashed, I would like to have read more of his works! This is a fast fun read with several twists. A good mystery and fun for ""Lost"" fans."
5,Great story even without the Lost connection,"I enjoyed the book just as much as any Lost fan. Yet, I didn't think the book would be as good as a detective book in general. Even a non-Lost fan (there isn't many) would love this book. Great read."
2,Complete waste of time... almost nothing to do with show...,"Other than the Widmore connection, this book has absolutely nothing to do with the show, and very likely not a single clue to the plot of the show either.How is it as a book, forgettable. If you have 3 hours to kill and nothing better to do, you could probably do worse, but you could definetely read a much better book."
4,Good for a quick read,"Bad Twin is like a modern day version of ""Clue"" except that half way thru the book you find out who the killer is, yet, that is not one of the many exciting twists that this book offers. Easily read, this one will provide a neat little mystery to entice your thoughts, but don't expect to be awestruck by the end of it all. Although the final resolution is rather cliche, it was the hunt that kept me anxiously flipping the pages."
2,Don't bother,"Although competently written, this book is not a very good stand-alone, nor does it offer any clue or value for the fans of LOST."
2,"Mediocre read, Lost is barely touched on.","The biggest connection to Lost in this book is the fictional author supposedly disappearing on flight 815, and Sawyer reading the manuscript on the show. Hanso is mentioned a few times, briefly. While I wasn't expecting much, this was a bit of a let-down."
2,Not that well linked to Lost,"Losing Gary Troup on Flight 815 did the world a service; his book was predictable and boring.For Lost fans thinking that they will find a nugget of information about the mysteries of the show, you will be sorely dissapointed. The links to Lost are superficial and do not further the story any more than can be found on most fan websites."
4,Good book,"People are trying to find a way that this is related to the tv show Lost, well it does not have a relation except for the fact that it was written by on eof the fictional characters on the show. This is a way for the book to draw press, and maybe even incorporate it into the show, as to sell more books. I have never seen Lost, but I picked up this book because of the gimmick that it was written by a guy who may have died in a plane crash, which I found to be intiguing. Anyway, it was a pretty good thriller that read quickly and was full of surprises, I admit that it makes me interested in watching Lost now. Regardless of the hype, it is a worthy read. Other good reads are James Patterson's Beach Road and David Demello's Speak No Evil."
3,I couldn't help myself,"I am an obsessive ""Lost"" fan - I admit it. I follow the message boards, I get the ""Lost"" magazine, I even add my two cents on the message boards from time to time. Just when I was wondering HOW I could survive a summer without ""Lost"", my pre-ordered copy of ""Bad Twin"" arrived in the mail (then I left it on a plane, and I actually bought another copy! It's pitiful - I know).I didn't really have high hopes for this book - I was really just looking for a summer ""Lost"" fix, but it turned out to be a not so bad mystery, and it was fun to pick out some of the subtle and not so subtle ""Lost"" references.All in all, I would give it a C+ or B-. I've read far better mysteries, and I probably would never have read it if it weren't for the ""Lost"" tie-in, but I do think the book is a mostly decent read. If you are looking for an exceptional mystery novel, I would pass on this book, but as a ""Lost"" fix, it did the job."
3,"Fun, light read - disappointed with LOST tie-in","I liked the book in and of itself, however, I was disappointed by the weak LOST tie in. I was expecting more talk of the HANSO foundation based on the web site's disapproval of the book....they barely said anything and it was pretty neutral.As for the book, the mystery was fine and a fun who-done-it type (or if done it..) but it wasn't very well written in my opinion. The story was told to you, not shown or revealed like most good books.Bottom line, if you want a light beach read, go for it. If you're looking for a well written literary piece or LOST clues, pass."
4,A great intro to mystery novels,"I am a Lostie, and when I saw this book, I had to read it! It re-introduced me to the world of True Crime novels. It read great and kept me turning page after page! After i was finished, I went out and began looking up other authors who write mystery crime novels. That's when I discovered what a genius Agatha Christie was. Bad Twin is a great read and I recommend it for those who aren't sure about mystery novels but are curious. I wish I could find Troup's other book, but, alas, A. Hanso has bought them all :("
1,"A slight read, nothing much to do with LOST except marketing","I am becoming a LOST addict and bought this book hoping for additional information of some interest. Don't bother. This book is marketed by ABC (check the publisher's address), but it has virtually nothing to do with LOST other than the come-on of the author's being on Oceanic 815. Superficial references to Hanso, Widmore, the Numbers but hardly worth paying for a hard back book. Some slightly charming characters but no real sleuthing or surprises."
3,3 1/2 stars,"I don't know anything about the 'Lost' television show, nor have I heard of this author before. I picked this off the library shelf awaiting another book.I the thought writing was well done. The mystery was average as was the protagonist--clues did seem to fall in his lap. This isn't a novel I would go out and purchase, especially since it's available on library shelfs."
1,Bad Twin = Bad Book,"This has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. The ""detective"" never does any detecting. He simply makes guesses with no evidence. He never asks the most obvious questions. All the answers just fall into his lap without him even trying. And the most laughable part? Literally every woman he meets wants to have sex with him. All he has to do is meet them and they simply can't resist him. Even to the point of one character sacrificing her career because of the love she feels for him after spending a few hours on a plane. My guess is the ""author"" (no surprise he kept his real identity a secret) is simply projecting his fantasies onto a fictional character.Do yourself a favor and stear clear of this one"
4,Better than Good,"Gary Glazner has accomplished something unprecedented with this collection -- he has produced the first national-level anthology archiving the Poetry Slam as its own form, in a book by, for, and about the participants. As such, it has many of the aspects of Slam itself. The voices in both the poetry and the accompanying essays are diverse and passionate, representing all ages, races, genders and geography that this Poetry Nation has to offer. For anyone interested in learning more or starting their own Poetry Slam, this is a terrific jumpstart, as well as a great collection of favorites for poets and audience members."
3,Solid collection lacking a full historical perspective,"3.5 stars, really. This anthology is a solid collection representing a wide range of voices STILL involved in the National Poetry Slam scene. Unfortunately, many voices are left out precisely because they are no longer involved in the scene which weakens the collection's importance as an historical document. Nevertheless, the poetry selected, along with the mixed bag of essays, makes this an invaluable supplement to ALOUD, still the king of ""poetry slam"" anthologies."
2,Mediocre stories for the most part,Most of the stories are antequated and not that good. They seem to date from the late Victorian period and are obviously in public domain.
4,Happy with Fifth AF book,The book has alot of pictures and the histroy of the 8th Photo Recon Squadron. It is very detailed about the bases and locations from where they flew out of in the South Pacific. There is also numerous lists and pictures of the pilots and enlisted personal attached to the squadron from 1942 to 1946. For the historical value I rate this book very highly.
5,"Great collection, good remastering","If you're looking for a ""Best Of"" Christmas album that includes many of the Holiday's staple music, look no further.This include Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer, as sung by Burl on the Holiday staple Christmas special of the same name.The remastering is well done and removes any pops, hiss or other similar issues associated with such old analog recordings as these.If you like Burl Ives' voice, you will like these tracks. If you don't like Sam the Snowman's voice or his vocal tracks from the original Rankin/Bass Rudolph special, then avoid this one."
4,A fine tradition!,"Talk about a time machine. If your grandfather could sing, he would have sung like this. A wonderfully comforting voice."
4,Return to your 1960's Childhood,"During the 1950's & 1960's, Burl Ives was remembered for his unique sounding American folk music. Today most remember him for his Christmas music from the TV special ""Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer"". The most famous songs from that series plus a few from the 1950's are in this collection. The production does sound its age, the separation & highs are off, or to write it this way: it sounds thin compared to modern recordings. I collect many records from many periods & most are better upgraded than this CD. Most songs are done rather straight forward, with few instruments & back up singers, which may sound a little corny for some, yet revealing a time of innocence & fun. Try out the Listen to Samples & see if you remember any of the songs & then sing along with your family. The most remembered are: Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer, Silver Bells, & A Holly Jolly Christmas."
2,Not Burl Ives' Best,"I purchased this CD thinking it was the same as a sound recording of Christmas music by Burl Ives released in LP form during the 1960's (remember LP's?). Ives is not in good voice in many of these songs, and in particular he seems to be rushing through ""The Twelve Days of Christmas."" In fairness, this is more of a 2.5 rating. If you want Burl Ives at his best, give this one a pass."
1,Shipped to wrong town.,I know the music is good. I just did not get it. It seems to happen with cd's when you order them
1,Never came,I never recieved it. I wanted it for Christmas and they said it would ship between 12/5 and 12/21! It is now 1/1/2012 and it still has not come!
4,The Unmistakeable voice of the late Burl Ives,"A great Christmas Album by the Late Burl Ives, who else has a ""Holly Jolly Christmas"""
3,Burl Ives Christmas,This is a keeper - Burl Ives way of singing was unique as well as his voice. It is a very enjoyable album of his renditions of Christmas music.
5,The MAGIC of Art Restoration,"An absolutely wonderful book. A highly informative dissertation on the conservation and restoration of paintings. This visual book covers all the aspects of the art of restoring paintings, canvases, panels, varnishes, backgrounds, etc. Detailed chapters include types of damage ( blanching, craquelure, fallout, separation, fissures, infestations etc.) their analysis, and most intiguingly the various methods of repair..Full of before/after projects, macro photos, and extraordinary procedures.There is a whole chapter on the formation of various wood, its structure, composition, and properties. The 'paint layer' chapter is unbelievable.This is the smaller (but not a small book) version of the $$$ bible by the same author (Knut Nicolaus (translated from german)). Oh sure there are whole masters programs and detailed technical journals relating to the art of restoring art. If you are into the world of art you will not be disappointed with this book."
4,Involved,"This is a text book with every aspect of restoration. If you are looking for a quick fix for a painting this book is not for you. But if you are like me, an artist wanting to repair and refurbish an old painting for a client then this book is perfect. I've found the history of restoration interesting especially the segment talking about using saliva. Imagine spitting on a priceless work of art to restore it too funny."
1,"Deceptively soothing until whammo, a jungle cat roars!","This starts out nicely with the humming sounds of insects, wind in the trees, and rain drops hitting the leaves of the plants below. Recording quality is well-done, the sounds of a stream are introduced a few minutes later (interfering with the imagery) as in ""where in the hell did this stream come from?"" Just as you're about to drift off to sleep a very loud roar comes out of nowhere, jolting you awake. I'm assuming it's a jaguar that got bored. This is not the CD for relaxation or meditation or sleeping. It's a good one for playing a joke on people, that's about it."
3,I'm still thirsty,"Brain Juice trails away from the usual format of Goosebumps books, taking the point of view from aliens Morggul and Gobbul, bent on taking Earthlings back to their home planet as slaves. Enter Brain Juice - what Nathan and his sister believe to be their cure for dumbness. But what does this have to do with the aliens? Who cares? This book is extremely unscary, lifeless, and has a predictable, rushed ending. R.L.Stine could use a glass or two of Brain Juice..."
3,Totally for kids only.,Don't expect any of Garfield's typical humor here. It's all very kiddy and the story of Garfield running away from home to an abandoned Elementry School only to learn that home is best is sooooo childish. Buy one of the comic strips books instead.
1,"Turn on your TV to a disconnected station, save your money!",My husband and I were looking for something to help us relax while trying to go to sleep and we both love water and waterfalls so this seemed perfect. WRONG! It sounds like nothing but static! I was extremely dissapointed with the quality and unrealistic sounds this CD has offered.
5,Hooray for boobies!,"I've seen all the massacre movies (slumber party I,II,and III, and sorority I) and this by far is the best one. This one actually feels like a horror movie. Same actress and guy who did the ""Haunting of Morella"". The best music, scary neighbor guy, ouija boards, spirit possesions, spooky haunting stories, and girls running around in nighties. This movie has it all!"
2,Where is the Gore??,"I agree with most of the other comments as far as ""cheesy and campy and humorously bad"" which you have to know beforehand... but what I didn't expect is the lack of gore. Instead of showing the gore they just cut away and show a shadow of it on the wall, or ever worse, show a splatter of blood on the wall, which is a huge huge disappointment for a ""horror"" movie. Not recommended... it's just too bad to enjoy."
1,A spoof on cheezy Z-grade slasher films!,"This one had nothing to do with the original, and is really bad! Features scream queen Melissa Moore. It's a confusing movie,'cause there's a flashback memory that shows scenes from the very first ""Slumber Party Massacre"", this is not based on that since there already was a sequel to that one! This movie is nearly plotless and badly acted with alot of corny bad comedy. There's a big scene of two sorrority girls taking a shower. The director has directed alot of films including ""Hard to Kill"", which he hired most of the actors in this film."
1,"i laughed, i cried, well...at least thoes chicks were hot.","well obviously i hated this movie so instead of writing a review (which i have been ordered to do) i will write down a song that means a lot to me.The Golden Girls Theme SongTHANK YOU FOR BEING A FRIENDBY: ANDREW GOLDThank you for being a friend,Travel down the road and back again,Your heart is true,you're a pal and a confidantAnd if you threw a party,invited everyone you knew,You would seethe biggest gift would be from meAnd the card attached would sayThank you for being a friendrose, blanch, dorthy, and especially sophia you will forever have a place in my heart. stay golden!"
3,Sorority House Massacre? There was a first?,"After the incredibly embarassing original, a sequel is born that will blow every other sorority house movie away. 5 girls move into a haunted house where after they undress and engage in a rousing game of OUIJA, one of them is possessed by the spirit of the original owner who killed a bunch of other girls before. Excellent low budgeter with some nice hook murders which never lose their charm. Oh, by the way, don't be decieved by the heart warming reanactment scene. Those scenes were NOT from the original."
3,NOT TOO BAD,"This is your movie if you're into the campy horror stuff,the girls are sexy and some of them started their ""B-Girl"" careers here in the SORORITY & SLUMBER PARTY SERIES,(like Gail Harris and Melissa Moore). SIMPLE PLOT:The girls run around naked and in their underwear, then get bumped off.But i don't know why this movie is listed as unrated, there is no ""UNRATED"" version to my knowledge or one that even says ""Nighty Nightmare"".if there is,i think both versions would have the same footage anyway."
2,"Don't buy this, buy the original soundtracks","I feel like beating myself up for buying this CD; i should've bought the original soundtracks. The music on this is very slow compared to the more fast-paced music on the movies. When you listen to this you barely feel like your listening to Back to the Future. The only exceptions to this are the tracks from the the Back to the Future III Original Soundtrack. I thought that the music from BTTF...The Ride was interesting because I am a big fan of the ride. However, besides these I think that you would be better off buying the original soundtracks. Take my word for it."
2,Great music - mediocre miking and mixing,"I love this music... but Varese Sarabande has to stop making re-recordings where it sounds like the microphone is in the back of the concert hall... this CD is frustrating, but if you love the music, you love the music."
4,"Good, but not as good as the movies","It was nice that some of this music that didn't appear on the other soundtracks is finally being released. However, these are new recordings, recorded in 1998 and not the same versions that appeared in the films (with exception of the BTTF III songs). The music seems a bit distant, and not as close up as the orchestra used in the movies. Overall, it is a wonderful album and it really invokes the feel of the movies. I just wish it sounded a bit more like the original versions...."
2,"Don't buy because of the quality, buy it because it is BTTF.","This CD has very poor sound, but if you buy this, just do it for Back to the Future, not the music."
3,It's Not The Best. . . . .But Pleasing,The music to Bact To The Future is one of the best and recognized scores in the etire music industry. Some score fans will be upset of the lacking originality of the real scores. This CD is not for everyone. I'm glad that this CD included more of the first movie. Although some of the snare drums used in the second recording sound like a guy banging on a detached car door. But the third movie score is excellent.Not for everyone But worth a try
1,What a disappointement!,"I was so excited to get this release, having loved these movies and the music which accompanied them. Well, the sound is so terrible, the orchestra sounds like they're a mile away, there are clunkers galore and the music is just not served at all. Some of the Varese rerecordings have been fine, some have been terrible and unfortunately this falls into the latter category and is possibly the worst of the bunch, right up there with Patton."
5,...and the b-sides are always the best.,"Whenever I've had the opportunity to read Mr. Hulse's work, I am always struck by the mix of brutal honesty and humorous social commentary. He hasn't failed to impress with this latest release. His jabs at the evil of corporate America, his insights into the dichotomous nature of public America, and his humble and hilarious comments on his personal life never disappoint. His raison d'tre is poetry, and this dedication is obvious. With the loss of so many great poets in the last 10 or 15 years, I am glad another voice is there to contribute to the art."
3,its ok,It is ok for watching movies and playing games..no lagging in games.for movies it the contrast is really bad if there is bright light aroundi got this monitor for a very cheap deal so it is ok
4,great quality,"case was alright, but the CD was excellent, was able to transfer the content into itunes just fine"
3,Not My Style,"I found the book a little hard to follow. When the murderer was revealed, I didn't really even remember who he/she was and didn't much care. I guess maybe the setting wasn't something I could relate to. The ""smart aleck"" tone turns me off too."
5,Another great Northwall book,"1100 years had passsed since The Time of the Fire, and civilization was slowly returning to what had been the Mississippi Valley. The male-dominated plains nomads had begun to settle peacefully around the citadel of Northwall, where they freely married with townsfolk. A new culture was evolving. But all was not well. Pelbarigan's conservative families longed for the old times: when their city led and Northwall followed; when plainsmen and citadelfolk were enemies. . .when women ordered & men obeyed!"
4,The Pelbar Cycle,"I ""The Dome in the Forest"" years ago but missed some of the other volumes in the Pelbar Cycle. Re-reading this story just confirms that the series is one of those hidden gems of the genre."
4,Pelbar Novels Are Refreshing,"The Pelbar novels are refreshing, and quite enjoyable. The writing is readable, although not riveting, and the basic societal environment is quite interesting. Characterization is above average.What I like most about these books, however, is the author's ability to make plausible the idea that problems can be solved with something other than fear and violence. This is a pleasing anodyne to Hollywood and the Republican Party."
5,IN THE TRENCHES - STATIC THOUGHT,"Static Thought's ""In The Trenches"" CD is a ferocious ride of fast punk songs. From start to finish it will keep you on the edge of your seat. From the opening track ""Drug Of My Mind"" to the closing track ""Next To You"", which is a Police cover, you will dig this CD. I highly recommend it."
5,Simply Awesome!!!,"Before I start...take those last 2 reviews with a HUGE grain of salt. PCBuilder runs across the street to a neighbor to type up a review on this product? Sounds fishy to me. Sounds like a Microsoft zealot trying to give a nasty plug to some much needed competition.I run a system I built myself. Has a 3.0 ghz P4 processor, 1 gig of pc3200 ram, geforce FX5500 video card, onboard lan, soundblaster live audio card, maxtor 100 gig ata/133 hard drive, sony dvd-r, sony cd-r...that's the basics.Out of the box it installed perfectly and ran perfectly the first time. And it is STILL running perfectly even after my 2 children got through hammering it.Suse has put out what is, in my opinion, the best distro out there."
1,Out of date,"Suse 10.2 has been out for quite some time now. This product is out of date. Amazon has the latest version also but the correct version does not always come up in a search. I bought this, discovered it was an old version, and ended up downloading the latest version for free anyway. Don't waste your money like I did."
4,not bad but not perfect either,"I am mostly pleased with this software, but I can't unequivocably recommend it, either. Broken out of the box is the software updater. This is a MAJOR faux pas, because you can't easily get bug fixes and security updates unless you have a working updater. In order to get it to work, you have to Google for the SUX updater, download, install and run it with: [ $ sux -c ""smart --gui""]. Don't expect to always get meaningful help from the free Novell support site if something complicated goes wrong. The KDE UI is clunky compared to OS-X and even Windows, but what can you ask for ""free?"" Nevertheless, so far, most of my woes have been fixable. I am seriously thinking of loading it on my daughter's laptop, just so I don't have to keep paying the anti-virus blackmail money to Symantec anymore. It's a decent product."
1,SUSE 10.1 Has Serious Flaws,"Hey - if you want to look at probably one of the nicest desktop environments around - but little else, Novell will sell you six CDs for $59.99.It didn't recognize the network card on my new Thinkpad Z60t (not exactly a marginal computer). They advertised (on the box) ninety-day technical support, except NOT for network support. I got this long, rambling sales pitch from a rep from Novell - very articulate, but dodgy when I complained.Forum after forum, I read about the same problem - network card recognizability and difficulty finding network drivers, installing them, configuring them and when it's all done (if you can reach this level) it may or may not work."
2,An overpriced disappointment,"I'm at a loss to understand the gushing reviews for this distro. On the positive side, it did work fine with my IDE internal floppy drive. It can read, write, and format diskettes. MEPIS linux can only read. It could work with my PCI internal hardware controlled modem by manually configuring it to ttyS1. At least it could do that logged in as root. Logged in as user, by default there is no permission to use the modem. It takes command line instructions to give it permission to work. I have not seen that before. SuSE 8.2 didn't do that. At least it's better than Ubuntu. For all the gushing about Ubuntu, I have not seen anyone mention its total failure to work with a PCI modem.For this much money one might expect support for 3D graphics with Nvidia cards would be bundled in. It isn't. I might consider giving it 3 stars if it were cheaper. Part of the justification for the price is the instruction manual. The instruction manual fails to address the problems."
1,Computer hung on Green screen!,"It said this was a easy install, well my computer is nowhung on a GREEN screen! During the install the screen becameall lines and weird colors then it froze, I tried hit keyboard buttons, but the only way to get it to shutdown was toPULL the powercord out of the WALL! Then it would come up withsome text that would scroll by and then it would display a GREENscreen again! ARGGNow I am using my neighbors computer to type this review, mycomputer is now useless with no Windows or anything to load up."
1,Will not load or work with my computer..... ARGG!,"I cannot even think of where I should start, first off Suse will not find my video card for some reason or another. So basically when I try to boot the operating system up, it scrolls some X-windows error and crashes with some mumbo-jumbo. If I wanted to use Dos again, this is it. My monitor is like making loud screeming noises when I get the display to work, like at 200mhz refresh rate and the screen is all weird looking like a carnival side show mirror. Also, the sound is strange, what is up with the glass breaking sound all the time, they talk about Windows having problems geesh!Now I am at a library using the internet thanks to this, plus it cost money to drive to the public library and they are fixing to close. They got me on this one, next time I will buy a computer with Windows XP at least it will work........"
3,To heck with games- it's a neat little computer.,"Frankly, I hate computer games, and I really hate these little hand held computers that kids seem to be glued to everywhere you go these days. Few things depress me more than seeing a kid sitting indoors (or outdoors, for that mattter) on a beautiful day, eyes fixed on one of these horrid little devices.So why on earth, then, did I buy one?Because once you get rid of those awful games, you've got a neat little computer there- and it's cheap, too. It's a digital camera, a programmable controller, and generally just a great platform for hacking. There are hundreds of web sites out there with information on hardware and software hacking these little beasts, and they can be had new and used dirt cheap.So throw out those games, and replace them with a soldering iron and logic probe. And have fun."
4,Christmas with Jackson 5,"All songs are good, but I love so much Santa Claus Is Comin' To Town, this is my favourite version."
4,Good,"Its a little skillet that cooks what can fit in it :)pretty simple, especially when u live in small tight living spaces"
3,Good pan for moderate use,"I no longer have this pan, it didn't last as long as I think it s/have, the coating started to come off, and YES... I only used the appropriate utensils, NEVER METAL!! I used to think T-fal was the best, but I don't know anymore. I think for the price it is a good product though. I do cook a lot and just used the pan for it's life expectancy I would guess."
2,t fal pan,This pan is not the same quality as my original T-Fal pan that I have had for some time. It is very light weight in comparison. I don't know if this brand has various levels of products or if they have changed all their products to a lighter weight.
1,product received different from pictured and poor quality,"The item received was different from the advertised picture. The interior was solid black with out the red center circle.The quality was extremely poor, light- wight, and the handle is shaky and loose at its insertion with once a week use for 2-3 month. Not worth even the low price."
1,Not as pictured,"The thermospot feature of this pan was my primary reason for selecting it. The pan that arrived did not have the thremospot. I contacted T-Fal and they said the part number on the wrapper was consistent with the pan having a thermospot. They offered to replace the pan, no shipping charges either way! I sent the pan to them and four weeks later the replacement arrived -- identical to the one I received via Amazon.I contacted T-Fal again and they offered to try replacing the pan again. I'll send it to them next week."
3,"Vivaldi: Concertos for flute Op 10, Beaumadier/La Follia/Poiget","Contrary to what I had expected, the performance has a very traditional feel. Little of the usually sparkling Beaumadier can be noticed. Neither does the performance as a whole seem to offer much new insight into these pieces of master composer Vivaldi.That having said, the rendition is natural, and probably representative of how the music may have been intended, changes in tempo exepted. The latter come out as an effort to bring the music alive, but seem to bring in unnatural fluctuations, rather. I feel that today one expects a more lively interpretation that brings this music out of the rather grave atmosphere found in this recording. Comparison to other recordings shows that this is well possible without violating the intention of the piece. Compare ""La Temesta di Mare"" (first 3 tracks) e.g. with Erik Bosgraaf's recording of it on recorder with the Cordevento ensemble (Brilliant Classics 93804)."
1,too much information,I'm a busy manager and if I had the time to sift through this book I'd get the information for free online - shame on the authors and publisher. Overpriced.
1,An unrealistic moral tale,"This book is preachy and poorly written overall. Alex is an irritating and unrealistically ""cutesy"" character, and the plot of the story is jumpy. The painfully obvious moral component of the book strikes the reader as being manipulative; Alex lies about her shoelaces which eventually leads to her being unable to pray... Tiresome. The beautiful and subtle work of an author such as Patricia St. John is much more spiritually sound, and makes for a better read. Stay away from this novel."
5,QIGONG TAOIST IMMORTAL EXERCISES,GREAT BOOK ON INTERNAL SPIRITUAL TAOIST ENLIGHTENMENT. GIVES YOU TECHNIQUES AND EXERCISES AND MEDITATIONS TO PERFORM TO REACH A HIGHER STATE OF SPIRITUAL CONSCIOUSNESS.
5,Thank You for this amazing book,This book was everything i expected and then some. It came brand new and still wrapped in plastic. Thank You.
1,Buddhist masquerading as a Daoist,"As pointed out by another reviewer, what we have here is some one who trained as a Buddhist for many years, trying to pass himself off as a daoist. These two traditions have very different methods of training, having been trained in one tradition does not make one qualified to speak on the other tradtion. Reading or translating a book of daoist practice does not make one an expert on daoist practice or qualifed to teach these arts."
4,Review of 'Whereabouts of Eneas McN',This story was a good follow up to previous novel based upon same character. It was thoroughly enjoyable and informative.
5,The best,"The best. I had the pleasure of spending two weeks in Ireland this summer--my first trip there. It was an illuminating experience, to say the least. Ever since I have returned, I have absorbed myself in all things Irish. Sebastian Barry's book is by far the best of the lot--including the much overrated. A Star Call Henry. This is luminous prose, which tells the full range of modern Irish history more graciously than any book I have read on the subject--so far. Each year I pick a book of the year for myself and send it out for Xmas to selected friends. This is the winner for 2000--and the year is not even over. A must."
5,a must read,"this book was recommended to me by a high school teacher who knew that i was interested in irish authors and wanting to explore beyond mccourt,doyle, and oconnor...the writing is totally luminous, lyrical, and totaly like homer...i also likened it to les murray's book called fredy neptune which also involved a world traveler that was like eneas, an innocent. i particularly loved the manner in which eneas was drawn repeatedly to his homeland, hoping that the situation had finally resolved itself...finding that it hadn't, had the courage or whatever to get on with his life...fabulous read."
5,Fantastic!,"This is a fantastic book! In ""Think Logically, Live Intuitively"", the author reflects on his journey to find answers pertaining to the ""facts"" that are presented in each of our lives. As a ""seeker"" myself, I appreciate his honesty and openness in exploring the ""facts"" and allowing the reader to decide for his/her self what is true for them.I find myself returning to this book often as I research the ""facts"" for myself. I highly recommend this book!"
2,Cheap,"Cheap Price, however cheap product too. It's true, you get what you pay for. The Gold flaked off during installation and the threads stripped. Very poor quality."
4,Great classic collection!,"What a great collection of the goodies from Ms. Gladys and the Pips! The collection spans years of wonderfully raw sound and solid emotion. I love to play this in the car when stuck in traffic in a bad mood. By the time I get where I'm going I'm mellow and singing along. If I Were Your Woman, Midnight Train to Georgia, Neither One of Us, The Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me, and The Way We Were rip my heart out and have brought me to tears a million times. The vocals have a raw ""been there, know the pain"" edge, and when you hear that voice you know exactly who you are listening to. What a great addition to any cd collection!"
2,Get Real,The voice!! Gladys Knight is with the gods.The material!! Sometimes very sketchy.You need more chances to capture the glory of Gladys than this 18 track (14 in reality) portrays. Spend more money and get Motown's Ultimate and Buddah's Greatest. Collect the Fury/Maxx stuff where you will.
4,final fantasy legend 1,I think it is the best because I play it all the time. My friend likes it and is mad because I owned it and found it.I am a big final fantasy fan so buy it if you dont own it buy it. it is really cool.
5,A WONDERFUL FIND!,"I was not familiar with this group til I heard one of their songs playedon the XM Satellite Radio bluegrass station and liked it. I checked theAmazon.com website, found this CD and (taking a chance) ordered it.Boy, am I glad I did! What OUTSTANDING bluegrass music! The qualityof the recordings is excellent. If you like really good, and I do meanREALLY GOOD bluegrass music, this CD is an absolute MUST!!! I dohighly recommend this CD to bluegrass music lovers! They don't make'em like this any more. I mean that quite literally. This is classicearly 50's vintage bluegrass in the class of Bill Monroe, Jimmy Martin,etc."

2,getting dull,"I have liked others in the series, but this one just didn't click for me. The 'twist' at the end was extreamly easy to guess. Her passive writing style is also beginning to grate, it's far too preachy and contained. The book didn't do anything good with the characters at all. Isobel's writing is losing it's spark, and I think she's relying to much on the fact that the girls are studying Wicca, instead of the real storyline. If you plan to buy this book just to see what type of Yule lore there is, and ideas for rituals, save your money. And if you still want to read it, get it out from the library.In summary, the passion has left the series. I can only hope it will come back soon."
5,Excellent reading - excellent value,"The books is written in a easy to follow style,no-nonsense,and contains both academical info about avalanches and practical , hot tips. A lot of valuable information is packed up in this book. The book is also copiously illustrated with both photos and graphical drawings to reinforce the knowledge contained in the text.All in all, it's a book that everybody which deals in mountain sports , or professionaly work in avalanche exposed terrains should read this book."
4,Excellent avalanche primer,"This book is perfect for an avalanche novice like myself, yet it contains a wealth of information that a seasoned backcountry traveler would probably find useful. Bruce Tremper clearly knows his stuff, and he has an ability to teach what he knows in a manner that is easy to understand. The prose is clear, and there are many excellent illustrations, figures, and photographs. This book will serve as a perfect companion to an avalanche course, and as a reference for years to come."
5,"Excellent, Easy Read, Useful and Practical","I really learned a lot of useful and practical avy knowledge after reading this book cover to cover. The book is well written and engages the reader. The author has extensive experience and demonstrates in the book a sense of humility that made me appreciate the importance of what he had to say. Part of the book focuses on the human factor of avalanche safety and risk communication amongst your group. I have a number of other avalanche books, and although I can always learn more about avalanche risk assessment and safe winter travel by reading as much as I can, I truly think I learned the most practical information from this book"
5,Wonderful book!,"This book was great. I don't know which book was better---this one or Martino's ""The Wolf, the Woman, the Wilderness"". Maybe I should read the Wolf book again just to make sure! Martino has a way with words; you can feel her emotions and see what she's seeing. This is a book that all horse lovers should definitely read."
2,Go for a better adapter,The adapter is much bigger than the HP's original adapter that came with my laptop. The length of the cord is also shorter than the original adapter and it heats up considerably. I am now facing a problem with it. The power supply is interuppted intermittently. I would strongly suggest you to invest little more in a better adapter.
2,Not a good buy,This plug wasn't very good. It's different than the picture shows. It works sometimes but the plug doesn't fit very well. You have to fiddle with it to get it to work at times. It comes out really easily too. Sometimes you can be working and it will come out and you could be at half batter when it should have been charging.
1,Not for use with NW8440,"Despite the title of this item and description, it is NOT compatible with the HP NW8440 notebook computer. The charging pin will not fit in to charge up the laptop. I bought this and had to go get another adapter when this one wouldn't fit in my computer."
1,This adapter does not work witth the HP dv5130us model,"It doesn't work with this model. its seems to be a high quality adapter, but no use.Note. the one that i get its not the one from the picture."
1,Not As Advertised!,"I ordered this ""equivalent"" adapter for my HP Pavilion DV6000. It is not equivalent. The power tip (part that is supposed to fit into the computer) is too long and doesn't stay connected. The charger brick itself becomes very hot to the touch - much more so than the OEM HP charger does. Also, this charger is NOT labeled as UL or CSA listed. Buyer beware!"
1,Already broken,Bought item 4 months ago and is already broken. Would definately NOT reccommend!! BEWARE!!
3,Be Careful,"There are lots of different specific Compaq Presario laptops out there, and this product does not specify its voltage, output or compatibility by HP part numbers. In addition, there are less expensive replacement AC adapters specified as compatible with particular HP parts--for lots less than HP charges, and less that this unidentified electronic recharging object."
4,Does the job but cord is a bit short,"This Adapter does the job the same way as the original we had. It even has a light indicator, which we didn't have in the original HP adapter. The only problem is that the cord is a bit too short; at least 50cm less than the original adapter (Could be a problem if you are not sitting very close to the wall). You can fix that by buying a longer cord that connects the adapter to the wall."
1,Did not work with my Compaq laptop,Beware this product. It did not work with my Compaq. A waste of money.Oh the disappointment and anguish I felt on the day I plugged this into my craptastic laptop. I threw up a little in my mouth when I realized this did not work.A waste of $20 dollars. Many a Ramen noodles were eaten the week I wasted my money on this. I tell you. I was forced to eat dog food because I had no money for food because I purchased this item.Beware.
5,Adapter not needed,I bought this product and a battery to go for my compaq presario and in turn the whole computer stopped working completley not long after. But both worked great up to that point!
1,"Avoid this one, it has nothing to do with HP NC6320","I bought this one for my HP Compaq nc6320, which has a special power outlet, but when I got it the outlet was completely different, a total waste of time!!I went to Radioshack and bought a universal power adapter (the iGo), don't waste your time on this item."
1,AC Adapter,"I am Disapointed only because the AC Adapter replacement you sended in both ocations was not compatible for my notebook, But I'm satisfied of the promt response on triying resolving the issue."
5,Story of the Year may have the CD of the Year,"This CD is amazing but first i would like to correct nick from orlando. if that crappy station mtv starts playing story of the year too much then they will do the selloutica move and suck like alot of bands did. anyways this CD is awsome. the only screamer band that compares is The Used i have loved The Used for some time now i do think they have more talent then SotY but SotY just came out so give them some time. Best tracks are ""Until the Day I Die"", ""Dive Right In"", and ""And the Hero Will Drown"". There is no cussing in this CD yet it gets a parental advisory, thats weird. Check out Story of the Year and while your at it get The Useds self-tiltled album its amazing. Later...."
5,My new favorite band,"This cd is so great, I saw the video for ""Until the day I die"" on MTV one day and told myself I had to buy that cd. I did and it has not left my cd player in my car. The lyrics are real and sooooooooooo RAD, I love this cd and can't wait to see these guys at warped tour!!!!!!!!"
4,"Good, been better.","I was a massive story of the year fan, about 2 years ago? I first heard them when they were Big Blue Monkey. I loved them because not only did they have excellent lyrics, tight instrumentals and an amazing live show, they had this raw feeling about them that you just can't create. As soon as this CD came out, I ran to get it, and it left me a little disappointed. It's way over-produced. It completely lost that raw feel to it that I craved and got me so hooked in the first place. After the 5th track or so, the cd blends together. Good, but it's been better."
3,Overplayed and Overrated,"While SOTY is definately better than some other choices, Good Charlotte and The Used come to mind as they have the same producer. But the fact is they have one single that's been played and played, between MTV, The Radio, and everyone else, I have heard ""Until The Day I Die"" so much that it's just become a grinding noise in my head. The least the band could do is pick a second single so we don't have to listen to the same old stuff over and over.Even die-hard fans have to admit that these guys are being overplayed.The rest of the CD isn't anything to write home about, there's some good tracks but nothing really stand-out, all in all Story Of The Year is alright, but I wouldn't say it's worth purchasing when there's so many other bands out there deserving of your hard earned cash."
2,Good at being mediocre,"This band will get praised by everyone who has never heard The Appleseed Cast or Cursive. They're good at what they do, but they aren't anything new. Everybody has already pointed out the obvious similarities to Finch and The Used. However, Phil (lead guitar) is freaking amazing. His old band, maybe today, had one of the greatest live shows to ever grace this planet. Okay, that's pretty extreme, but they were really good. Check them out on mp3.com and be amazed."
3,isnt exactly ripping anyone off,"this band gets a lot of criticism for being unoriginal, but does anyone care to remember a little band from st.louis known as big blue monkey? theyve been playing this type of music for quite some time now..."
4,"THIS IS MY FAVORITE CD, I COULD LISTEN TO EVERYDAY!!!!",this cd has a lot of good songs and has an a pretty cool sound to it. if you like music with singing and screaming its for you. actually listen to the lyrics and you'll see that they are a pretty tight band!1- ok but kinda annoying2- awsome at first then overplayed.3- sorta winy but good4- i love this song it is so tight5-good a little weird6-good7-alright8- totALLY PIMP FAV SONG9-SLOW BUT DEFINATLEY GOOD10-HATE IT11- NEXT FAV SONG12 PRETTY GOOD ALOT LIKE AFIi'VE SEEN THEM IN CONCERT AND THEY ARE AWSOME DEFINATLEY A GOOD BAND AND I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM
2,almost as good as nSync,"Can the vocalist sound any more like Saves the Day? Did SOTY steal lyrics from STD? Do we need any more 'intense' screaming parts mixed with singing. OK, the music is very generic, heard it all before, overproduced, melodic emo/hardcore whatever you want to call it. Cleanly sung vocals, with the obligatory scream so the music can be intense and tough. Oh, and have you seen their videos. What a laugh, I love guitarists that do karate kicks and spin moves. All I can say is corporate pretty boy rock crap trying to be passed off as indie. Can't wait till the day that SOTY dies from everyones mind."
2,Copying Finch and TBS gets you nowhere,"All Ive got to say is if you want to hear an original emo-core band that does it right, go buy any Further Seems Forever Cd. This band just doesnt cut the mustard when it comes to recording an album that will be more than just a two year fad. They're lyrics are too desperate and forced, they seem way too poetic for their own good. Thursday can do the poetry, these guys can't. Its catchy, yes, but anything worth buying? Absolutely not."
1,the story of this year is that this is horrible music,"in your head: rate this album on a scale of one to ten, then put a negative sign in front of said number. that is how good this actually is."
2,it sucks,it has alot of energy but i dont see the talent behind it. If you like this then you require mood altering pharmaceuticals. make sure you see a psychiatrist because a psychologist can't prescribe what you'll need.
2,a must-buy if you like emo crap,"these guys sucked when they were big blue monkey, then they moved to los angeles, changed their name, still claimed to be from st. louis, and sucked even more. newsflash: the lou don't want ya. cut it out. this gets 2 stars for not making me vomit."
1,Don't buy this CD,"No I do not own this cd but a friend of mine does and forced me to listen to it. Complete crap...come on how many emo bands does the world need??? None that's the answer...don't waste your money on this ""lalala I love you"" crap with the same chord lines in each song. These guys are following a trend and so is anyone that listens to them...stop listening to what MTV says is cool and start listening to good bands like Aus Rotten and LCB."
1,TERRIBLE,"people say this sounds like the used, well im not even gonna get into that because they dont compare, i can proudly say that soty suck, they are a complete rip off and they sound exactly like every other band out there, their lyrics and their music is horrible, unoriginal, cliche...we need more bands that can create original intense sounds, not just what they think would sell. ill admit some of the songs are catchy, but they are going to bore u by the 3rd listen. dont bother spending money on this garbage."
2,Pretty bad,"Well...this is basically mainstream pop. No life, I couldn't even listen to the whole thing in one sitting. I gave it two stars because there is one decent song. I don't think anyone will be listening to this CD in a couple of years, cuz i certainly wont. Another cd that is going to gather dust on the shelf......."
2,depending on your tolerance...,"the best way i can describe this band is that they are good at doing what has already been done. i probably would have liked this cd if it came out a couple of years ago, when the genre was just emerging. By now the whole sing a verse scream a chorus has gotten old and predictable to me. it has lost its impact because so many bands have already done it. the other thing that i didnt like were the lyrics. normally a few bad lyrics wont bother me but some stick out like a sore thumb (ie ""until the day i die, ill spill my heart for you""). its just so (oh no here comes the word again) cliche in my opinion. i suggest this cd if you like bands such as finch/the used/static lullaby (which i do), but can handle another band that sounds very much alike. i have become bored with these bands copying eachother, but if you have not this cd is for you. happy listening."
2,First Listen.,"I only got this record today, because i admit im not the biggest Story Of The Year fan, and only because i like 'Anthem of Our Dying Day' and 'Untill The Day Die'. Overall, all i can say is, im still not their biggest fan.I feel this cd is a let down. Bascially all the tracks sound the same and left me bored only being three or four tracks in. Though they are lyrically and musically are very good and there are a few catchy tracks, but nothing stunning except for a few tracks. There is an uncanning resemblance to the Used. The vocalist sounds like the vocalist of the Used. Now, this could be because both band's debut record are produced John Feldman. Also, a lot of the tracks sound very overproduced, and i found it annoying have a drummachine on the first five tracks, making it sound even more overproduced.On the whole, I just didnt like this cd, but i think a lot of people out there who like the used, will dig these guys. And they do put on one hell of a live show."
1,not another one,"I must say that i enjoyed 3 songs, but none of those songs included the word dying, or involve the sad ""i wish that i was hardcore"" scream. i would rather stab my ears with dull pencils than listen to this album agian. dont waist your 15 dollars. buy the used instead"
1,Band of the week,"God are you kidding me, MTV and yet another pop punk band called Story of the Year. Are you kids so intensely brainwashed that you need to listen to this album called Page Avenue? Learn to play an instrument, learn some genuine anger, and lash out against a generation that doesnt have a friggin clue about punk music, its a total sham that MTV and radio is responisible for the decline of heavy metal and punk music, Story of the Year being case in point."
1,Isn't this Finch?,Ok I know the name of the group is Story of the year and all but doesn't anyone else think they sound like Finch???? I mean come on the lead singer's voice sounds exactly the same. So I don't know what to think. Someone fill me in here???
1,eek,"I would first like to say that, I have not listened to/bought this entire CD, but out of what I have heard of it, I would have to say I liked about five seconds. Their drums sound like a grown man gasping for air and their vocals are so flat and emotionless that I have a hard time understanding what the lyrics mean plainly by listening to the song. Their choruses are so annoying that when they are combined with the same guitar chords that have been played throughout the song it makes my head swell up. Maybe the songs I haven't heard are better, but I still don't think I'll change my mind."
2,ah hem.,"I'm going to flat out say it...I heard this album the first time when it was called ""What it is to Burn"" by Finch. Done and Done, that is my review. I believe people give this album too much credit, it's crap."
4,Awesome debut for SotY...,"This is a great debut for Story of the Year. While they're no different from bands like The Used, Hawthorne Heights and Yellowcard, they manage to create a very solid first effort. Highlights are UNTIL THE DAY I DIE, AND THE HERO WILL DROWN, ANTHEM OF OUR DYING DAY, PAGE AVENUE and SIDEWALKS. If your're into hardcore emo (screamo just sounds stupid) then this is right up your alley. And eggplant, this is the first time I've disagreed with you ever. Your hatred for hip-hop, Ashlee Simpson and Limp Bizkit is an inspiration. Cheers."
4,"Good debut, hope therz more good stuff to come","Story of the year have the potential to be a great band and release a number of good albums if they keep there efforts up after releasing this debut album. It's amazing stuff in that it combines emo/screamo music with punk and hard rock. The lyrics are deep and the instrumentation is great. The guitar riffs stand out in particular on songs like ""anthem of our dying day"", ""until the day i die"", ""In the sahdows"" and ""dive right in"". Dan Marsala's voice is pulsating as well wen he rips his vocal chords with great intensity. This album on the whole has everything u wud want from a rock album, and only after listening to this album can one see how good this band is."
5,Great Cd,"Ahhh. Story of the Year. One of the best bands ever, in my opinion. When I went to a Good Charlotte concert, some members of the Story of the Year street team handed out some free demos. After the show, popped it in, and was amazed. These guys make great music. They're lyrics are real and easy to relate to. And they have amazing musical skills. The lead singer, Dan...has one of the best voices, I have ever heard. Absolutely amazing band. I would diffidently consider picking this CD up. There's bonus footage which is hilarious. The band name is perfect for the band. These guys are going to be the next big thing. A new edge of Rock music is on this CD."
5,Best Album In My Collection,"One of the best albums in my collection. I saw them live and bought the cd the next day and havent stopped listing to it since. For a ""little-known"" band's debut, this albums great."
2,Heard it before...sorry guys its not that great,"Story of the Year is yet another band that falls to the same cliche sounds of emo and punk. I love bother generas, however, this band sounds just like every other band out there. They are pretty good at what they do: producing songs that are sweet to rock out to, but like I said they lack originality.This cd can be summed up in a couple words: ""The Used."""
1,Hard rock for cool dudes,"My favorite part is when the gorilla yells ""until the day I die"". Simply profound and moving. Their level of articulation, lyricism and word play is top notch. but don't worry bro, they don't use any big words and the metaphores (thats where they compare stuff) are simple.If you are the coolest dude at your high school you'll jock this like a mofo. It's sensitive music for meatheads. (...)This album is very important in the history of music. It's not like you'll pretend not to own the album next year. Getting dumped by a chick is the worst thing that can happen...EVER!"
2,what's the story?,"On Page Avenue, Story of the Year can't decide if they want to be a peepy, pop-punk band, or a hard-core, sceaming, Metalica covering (i have had the good fortuneate to see them live before this review)band. I really like the melody to most of the songs, but about half-way through all of them the singer's vioce takes a turn for the rageing sound. This albem sits somewhare between bands like A.F.I and bands like Slipknot. It's not a bad c.d., but the vocals are just weird.Page Avenue does carry a ""Parental Advisory"". They don't flat out curse, but most of the lylics are violent."
1,Emo is not all good,"Emo music, what can I say about emo thats not to mean to the fans of it...Dont get mad at me I am just speaking my mind, But Emo's complain alot about random things like slit my wrists or talk about heartbreak I know heartbreaks hard to get though I understand but when you talk about ur parents or complain alot its just not the best. I am not saying you should stop listeing to it they just like to complain about slitting my wrist, parents, or killing theirselfs..."
1,This is what's passing along for rock nowadays?,"Honestly, this emo genre needs to die. There isn't ONE band out there that does it any good. I love how bands like this say they're tired of all these bad songs on the radio, and then you hear absolute drivel like this on the radio. I can't tell them apart from any other pop punk band. Pop punk-there's an oxymoron! Ever since Green Day, bands like this have truly reeked up the radio. Don't bother. If you want good punk...um, sorry, there is no such thing as good punk! Thank you, good day."
2,Story of the Year..yes the Worst Story of the Year,"Story of the Year, what can't I say to make fun of a poser filled band? Until the Day I Die? Like Im going to hate this album until the day I die? Story of the Year sounds like a christian band at my old church that ruled. But that's what they sound like..a towny band that had nothing better to do but SUCK. This album lacks an originality and I think they came up with the lyrics off a website or a bad movie.I'm sorry to say I will never own this album or any other they put out. This is some of the cheapest and worst crap I've ever heard, and if I was their record label, I would be personally ashamed that I put out such crappy stuff. I for one will be boycotting this album, whos with me??These ppl suck bad..DO NOT buy this album..buy Korn or slipknotThanks"
1,Not even worth downloading...,"I don't know how to put this in any other way. This band IS A TOTAL WASTE!!! The vocals pierce the eardrums with such an annoying sound that I had to sell it after 3 songs. I couldn't stand it. The guitar riffs and instrumental combinations are so generic that you wonder if the band has any real talent at all. I couldn't stand to listen to the cd all the way through, and maybe those without any musical sense will like this cd, but if you actually have a taste for music... pass on this cd!!! I'd rather listen to the over-played, over-rated, on the radio every 3 songs mainstream punk than listen to this cd... DO NOT BUY!!"
5,SOTY!!!! HELL YEAH PPL \m/,"I first came across this band while playing Need For Speed Underground (strange or what!!!) I then downloaded some of their songs from kazza, and i loved them, they sound so... cool, with the fast tempo and cool beats. I dont have a favourite... well i suppose 'Burning Years' is because of its superb intro and just rockin throughout. I bought the album after weeks of saving money, and when the day came i took my walkman with me to play it straight away lol. This CD kicks ass... but Linkin Park are my fav band, they are just the best!!! U cannot match them, every so often i change my mind on wat my fav song is cos they are all soooo great!!! At the moment its 'Forgotten' (track 10, Hybrid Theory) (u know it ppl). Even the reanimation CD kicks ass 'Krwling' is the best on that album followed by 'With You' ( hearing Chester screaming at the beginning!!!)Peace out ppl!!!!"
5,this is some good music,"let me say that i have been in a true punk scene since i was 15. i cut my teeth on bands like bad religion, black flag, the virus, lower class brats, and the list goes on and on. and believe me when i tell u that even though this cd may not be street punk, it is still punk rock. it is loud, fast and hard, the lyrics are meaningful. dont listen to some self-righteous, elitist moron who doesnt know the first thing about punk rock when he says that this is bad cuz honestly, it is one of the single best CD's ive heard in a very very long time. take it from someone who REALLY knows what punk is. its not about how many tattoos u have or ur appearance, its ur music and the attitude thats behind it. this is an evolution in punk rock, and im welcoming it with open arms"
4,Great Music & Great Lyrics,"I started to like Story of the Year when I heard their first song and when I heard the whole album, I was hooked. It's a good mix of slower songs and more upbeat punky songs. If you listen to the lyrics, they're also pretty good. This is definately a CD you can listen to from beginning to end; a rare find these days, I might add."
5,A trip down Page Avenue is a dream vacation,"I have been listening to metal/screamo/punk/indie records for sometime now. I have a very wide taste and have heard just about all most of those genres have to offer. SOTY was one of the first bands I ever heard from those mentioned genres. This being the cd I heard. I own both this cd and their sophomore effort ""In the Wake of Determination."" Both cds have similar sounding songs but PA has so much more rawness and grit to it. The guitars hit hard in both albums, but the vocals are so much more heartfelt in Page Avenue. Dan did what most lead singers do in their second or third cds, go soft. You can only scream they way they do so much before your vocal chords tell you they've had enough. If you ask me, Dan's scream is probably the most clean cut and best sounding out there in this cd compared to others in the genre. Stand out tracks are ofcourse, Until the Day I Die, Anthem of Our Dying Day, and Razorblades. All tracks are decent."
3,pretty good,"This CD is a pretty rad. Some songs on it are overplayed and over-rated like ""Until The Day I Die"", and ""Anthem of Our Dying Day"" got kinda big, with the video in all, which was pretty BA, by the way...overall i think this is a pretty cool cd is sit and chill toobuy it, and you'll most likely like it"
5,You have to get this album!!!,"I listen to a whole array of music, and it's very hard for me to pinpoint who my favorite artists are. After hearing this album, I have to place Story of the Year in my top 5. Not only do they have great lyrics that actually make you think, but they also have a sound ranging from pumped up-make you want to jump around music, to sit and chill music. If you're into rock, like linkin park, yellow card, hoobastank, you have to get this album! I can listen to this album start to finish and I love every track. Check this one out."
2,Sorry,"I didn't like this one. For all of the dramatic song titles, I was disappointed in the net dramatic effect.I found all the songs to be too similar in sound and this is one of those CD's I'll only listen to in small doses, if at all."
4,More Like Band Of The Year,"Until the day i die, i will listen to this album! The first time my frined told me about these guys, i had to check out this album. The first song i heard was Until The Day I Die. It rocks! It's such a unique song with modern punk/pop. The other song i heard was Anthem Of Our Dying Day. That's okay, but i would recommend something more like Sidewalks. Razorblades is my favorite track on this album. Most people seem to ignore it but, i love it. It's a song that you can really bop your head to. The rhythm of the drumming holds it all together. This band is amazing! Buy this album. Cuase if you don't, your really missing something."
5,SWEET,"I love this cd what else can i say . the songs are deep they have meaning to thier songs unlike sum other bands out there.My favorite songs are--> until the day i die,swallow the knife and sidewalks ohh geez their all kick ass i love all the songs."
5,Great Dudes,These guys are more than just a great band they got great personalitys-i got to meet them before a concert and they were funny and great i loved them. this cds great and i love it there gona be the next big thing-buy this cd it kicks major ace!!
3,Not a bad album,"Its worth a listen.Not everyone's going to like the album, but the first few tracks are good and the latter tracks grow on you.Well worth it as an addition to your collection."
2,"the used, part 2","this must be a joke. this band, which seriously sounds nothing like ANYTHING but mainstream radio rock with some ""emotive"" lyrics, are getting lots of attention in place of many other bands who have been doing the same thing, and BETTER, for months. i heard good things about them and downloaded a few of their songs but promptly forgot about them in about 5 minutes after giving them a listen. these guys aren't quite as bad as the used, and for that they get 2 stars. however, i don't understand how this colossal crap gets popular. especially in the wake of the release of the newest thursday album, war all the time, which actually deserves a listen. utterly forgetable and generic..."
2,one of the bland albums,"most of the songs on this album sounded pretty much the same. if u only like their singles, then i recommend just buying the singles and not the whole album. i thought it was a waste of $16."
5,Awesome CD,"This CD is really good. Alot of people don't like SOTY and I can't get a grip on why. Their sound is really good and powerful, and the screaming is really good, some of the best I've heard. If you like these guys though, and really want to have the ultimate SOTY experience, you HAVE TO see them live. I saw them twice, the first time they were the opening band, second time they were the headliners. Both times, they played their hearts out and delivered awesome stuff. The bassist is crazy live, he goes insane on stage. All around really good show."
5,SOTY = ONE OF MY FAV. BANDS,"This CD is great. Every song on this CD is very good. If you have only heard one or a few songs of Story of the Year, and like them, you will love the entire CD. -=Very Highly Reccomend=-"
2,Blehh,"How could the last guy even put this sad sack of crap band ""up""there with Glassjaw?? Go to a Glassjaw concert and hang your head in shame fool."
4,Yup,"Kinda Reminds me of The Used, the way they scream. Good CD though, I reccomend it to all fans of emo."
1,If I could give it 0 stars i would,"This is probably one of the worst albums I have ever listened to. It is unoriginal, annoying, and just....bad. My friend bought it because she liked ""anthem of our dying day"". She told me she'd make a copy for me, but as we listened to it on our way home, I told her not to bother.The lead singer, if you dare call him that, is the worst part of this cd. Although I can appreciate some screamo, he is too much for me. His voice is forced, there is no emotion, and he just sounds like the idiot poseur he is."
1,Snoring Of The Year,"It's difficult to put into words just how much I dislike this. It's utterly predictable, extremely repetitive, laughably formulaic. In short this is completely putrid. I played some of this to some friends and family and they ALL thought I played the same song over and over. And that idiotic screaming sounds like a baby wailing 'I WANT MY BOTTLE!!'. It's funny that they call this 'emo' since emotion is one of the main things this junk is missing. This has about as much feeling as a recording of the time and temperature."
1,"ugh, pure ugh.","This is pure formulaic disposable pop garbage. This is a good example of what happens when a major label tries to capitalize on something that was good 2 years ago when it was considered indie. The screams are in the right place so the singer sounds angry and depressed about a failed relationship that happened in high school, their live shows and videos have scripted spin kicks and guitar twirls to make the guitarists look ""hardcore"", and of course there are the lousy over dramatic lyrics that draw in the average teenager that shops at hot topic who thinks this is raw and indie. Go out and buy this if you like your pop music lousy and super sugary. If you wanna be ""hardcore"" listen to The Refused or Converge. If you wanna be another pop princess by all means buy this craptacular cd."
1,SKIP IT,"This cd is okay with 3 good songs, but it wasnt worth it. I was told that if i liked the used then i would love them... but sadly they fail miserably in comparison."
2,riiigghttt,"at least listen to refused or ATDI or even Thursday to get an idea of what being halfway original means. these guys suck, just like the other 48,000 bands that have come out with the same style crap. they toured with linkin park, enough said. don't even waste your money."
1,Nothing New,SOTY have not made some revolutionary new cd. They have simply followed in the footsteps of a countless other number of bands. This music doesnt qualify as emo simply because the band is so image aware. Even the screams are over produced. This is just another form of alternative rock. The lyrics are unimaginative and dull. If you want a real band that is redefining the music scene listen to The Blood Brothers or Glassjaw. They have put out cds that blow SOTY out of the water.
3,This is not actually High Definition,"The images has not been taken in high definition. Visually, we see like an ordinary 720p movie. It seems in some part of the process, that they had used some low definition equipment. The BBC Planet Earth Blu-ray is totally sharp in 1080p."
4,I love these speakers,"I had a pair of altec lansing speakers for a number of years. I thought they were okay until the left speaker kept going out. Partly because of the Bose reputation and partly because of the price I decided to give these a try. They were very easy to set up and they sound great. My one little complaint is that the on/off switch is located on the back of the subwoofer which I have placed on the floor under my desk. That means every time I want to turn them off, I have to crawl under my desk to do it. I don't know why the switch couldn't have been incorporated into the control dial (which I love). Other than that, I'm very happy with these speakers and I'm very glad that I bought them."
4,Bose Companion series 3 review,The speakers work very well. The metal inserts that go into the subwoofer were a little off but easily fixed and now the speakers play music great.
2,"Good out of the box, then, long slow decline in operability","They (emphasis) work great.I listened to the Companion speakers in the store...best of the set on display. The set I bought worked well from the start. Good bass, weak midranges, good highs, but good for computer listening.After about a year, I thought I heard a buzz, but thought it could be a light in my office. Nah. Buzz progressed, and just now, came back in from an hour away....the buzz was there with the sound off and the light unplugged.If you're looking for reliable...go elsewhere. These are not made to last, and for the price, they should last longer than 1 1/2 years.Crap."
5,Excellent quality for the price,Good quality of high & low tones. The sub woofer is heavy and the overall effect is excellent.
2,Speaker are great but wires are cheap.,The sound is very good when the speaker wire connection is good. I have to constantly move the sub-woofer to get a good connection to the two small speakers. What good is a sound system with great speakers with cheap wires? I have Altec Lancsing speakers on my other PC for many years and NEVER had a problem. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS EXPENSIVE SPEAKER SYSTEM.
2,Irritating,"Absolutely no mid-range to these ""emperors new clothes"" speakers. And they buzz when there should be perfect audio silence on your laptop."
1,Sounds Great But Poor Quality,"I purchased my Companion 3 set in early December 06 last year. In mid November 07 they quit working. It just produced a very loud hum from the sub woofer. Since it was in warranty, I returned to Bose for repair. When the set returned, it still had the same problem. I returned again and they sent a new set which I received in mid December. This set lasted about 4 weeks and then developed a very noticeable 60 cycle hum from the sub woofer and a low level hiss from the satellites.During the time the Bose were out for repair, I purchased the Logitech Z 4's to hold me over and for under $70, they were amazing. The Bose are going out with the trash this week and the Logitechs are what I am sticking with from now on."
5,exactly what i wanted,these things sound AMAZING and are more than adequate for my home audio needs.
2,Confused,"I just picked these up, along with a new high end sound card for my PC. I am shocked at all the good reviews for these speakers. The design is really great, which is why I didn't give them 1 star, but they sound terrible. The speakers don't produce highs very well (or at all in some cases) and the subwoofer is one of the worst I've ever owned. It's very boomy, the bass is either overwhelming or non-existent. The bass doesn't immerse the listener at all. I've played around with placing it all over and no matter where I put it, you can hear exactly where the bass is coming from, it doesn't fill the room up at all. I've tried different computers and my iPod and they all sounded the same. I don't understand what people like about these speakers, there are so many systems at half the cost that sound 10x better."
1,Static,"Maybe it was just defective, but the ones I received also had static. I was told that that might just be the way they are -- and I tried using multiple imput devices (ipod, computer, line out and headphone). So it could be a QC issue, but it seems to come up with some frequency."
3,Great while they lasted,"I bought these speakers about three years ago. I like everything about them that the other positive reviews have to say, but the right speaker just blew. It still produces some sound, but it's barely a shadow of the left speaker. I have to seriously overbalance, and will have to get new speakers if I really want to appreciate music while working at my computer. Oh well..."
3,"Good Sound, Bad Cords","I've had this system for over a year now. Overall, it works good and sounds great - it better for the price. However, the cord connections in the back constantly come loose and leave the sound full of static or off balanced. I'm always having to adjust the cords until they're secure again, and it's not just one speaker cord, it's all of them. It's a real pain! It first started happening about 3 months after the purchase and has gotten progressively worse."
4,Bose Companion 3,It's one of the best multimedia speaker I've ever seen. The sound quality is really good. I can here every frequency range very clearly. There's one thing I don't like about it. The switch and the volume controller is too sensitive.
2,speaker buzzing not a clear sound,the speaker is buzzing =( it works but the cables are not all perfect soo sad! the sound is great when its loud...but when no music is on it hummz and is quite annoying
3,With a Little Tweaking These Speakers Sound Very Good,"When I initially set up these speakers with my iMac, I was disappointed with the sound quality. The highs were tinny, the mid-range was terrible (vocals sounded like they were coming from a deep tunnel), and the lows sounded boomy. However, after downloading some equalizer software (JoeSoft Hear), these speakers sounded very good, especially considering their diminutive size. The sound output just needed a little tweaking. I'm sure that any other sound equalizer software would work as well. Unfortunately, out of the box, I can't recommend these speakers. For $200+, you shouldn't have to buy additional software to fix the sound."
4,"Excellent Speakers, but Expensive","Bought these a couple of weeks ago to replace my old ones. My wife's old Insignia speakers (junk) finally died and I gave her my Harman/Kardon's. I decided to splurge on the Bose to replace them. Very nice sound (range, depth, highs), look nice, sturdy. Would be nice to have the base control on one of the top speakers, rather than the back of the sub woofer...for the price, it should be. My only other observation is that they are very pricey....and that is why I only gave them 4 stars instead of 5. The sound is better than my old Harman/Kardon's, but not really enough better to justify the price. But if you can afford them, I recommend them."
5,"Great Design, Great Sound","It's difficult to see what more you'd want - it takes up very little space, installs in seconds, features a very neat desktop volume control with tap-on tap-off feature (including colored LED on/off indicator). Sounds spectacular. Unless you plan to fill a very large room with sound, this is about as good as it gets (and saves a little money over the new Series III). Expensive, and worth it."
4,I would not return this product if the price is about 100 - 150,"I never believed the online review and stuffs, so I decided to buy this and compare it with different speakers I have. The result was kinda disappointed; bose companion 3 II sounds worse than my TEAC CD speakers which I only bought for 150 bucks 4 years ago. The high tone was not as clear. Then, I compared bose companion 3 II with my current computer speakers (OZAKI) which I also bought 4 years ago. Undeniably, bose sounds better for the high range and low range, but not in a very obvious way. It is also worth mention that I only bought OZAKI speakers for 25 bucks when I was in Taiwan.Overall Bose companion 3 II are not bad speakers, the sound quality is good( but not superior). But we must raise a question: is it really worthy to spend 250 bucks for that?? You will need to compare this product on your own."
1,Well at least 1 speaker works!,Bought these at Best Buy at a good price. Got them home and plugged them in and in the beginning everything was great. Sound was outstanding but after about a month the right speaker went out. It looks like I'll be taking these back to replace them with something that works. Too bad because these Bose sounded really great.
3,Review of the Bose Companion 3 Series ii,"Mine failed after two years. The sound was a bit tinny, and the bass would not reach so low. It was nothing an equalizer couldn't fix, but it still needed it. These are small but deliver so much sound. Not the best sound I've ever heard, but it was load sound. the highs were okay, but they started sounding distorted after cranking them up. The volume control on the Bose Companion 3 Series ii was one of the best I've seen. It was so simple. The bass module was not good. It delivered bass you couldn't feel. The bass knob on the acousti-mass module was a bad spot to put it. Mids were tinny even after two years.If you can find these for no more than $100, they are a good buy, but if you want something better, go for a Klipsch or even Logitech. M-Audio would be 3 steps up from these despite the Bose costing $100 dollars more. Don't be fooled. Don't overpay for the name."
3,disappointed,"I just bought and hooked up this system. It's being returned tomorrow. I felt the mid ranges were lost. The highs were piercing and the bass was too ""thump, thump, thump"", like those cars that shake the neighborhood as they drive by. If that's what you like, then you'll be happy. Me? I like a nice balanced sound that I can HEAR not feel. I equalized the sound, but still not great balance. The mid ranges were still not crisp. Also, this system did not sound as loud as it did in the store."
5,excellent,"I think I get excellent sound with these speakers...Bose equipments are known to be expensive but I think the price for this product is worth it...for me, I live in a small apartment and I don't need a complete sound system, which would be way more expensive for my needs and useless at this time...I love music and with these speakers I have everything I was looking for: good quality sound, easy to install, something I would plug into my apple airport and get my music wirelessly from my computer....I can also plug the TV if I want as it has an input for the TV as well...I would definitely recommend this product..."
4,Great sound but ...,The speakers seem a little boomy at first but that can be adjusted.Only flaw for me is that the amplifier inside the subwoofer stays on all the time. How much energy does this waste???It seems to me that Bose could engineer in an auto shut off feature when they are not in use.
4,Beautiful Looking....... Nice sounding,"I really like Bose. I like the company, and I like the products they release. I was building my new PC system and saved enough cash to spring for some Bose speakers, although I couldn't bring myself to go for the Companion 5's so I settled with the 3's.I really like these speakers, they sound great. When I am listening to music it is a really enjoyable experience.If I were to have an issue, and mainly the reason I couldn't give 5 stars, was that the low tones seem to be only picking up in the sub, and are really distinguishable from the rest of the sound being produced. This separation of sound was noticeable to me and enough for me to mention it here.I would recommend any Bose product to people who can afford them, they are excellently made, and Bose is a great company that sinks 100% of its money back into research and development of new sound technologies. They will always be a leader in the field, and always be on the cutting edge of sound."
1,Not a good value,"I have used Lansing speakers for a few years now. I play soft jazz during my eye examinations, and get a lot of compliments from my patients on the music I play. So when I got a new computer in my other office, I thought I would get the $249.00 Bose speaker system and hook it up in my main room. This would really sound great. When I set up the system I was very impressed at the quality of the product and couldn't wait to hear the music. When I turned on the system for the first time though I actually got mad. How can Bose justify their $249.00 cost when to be honest with you the Lansing system actually had a better sound. Thinking it was just me though I asked not less that 5 other people their impression and it was the same. Tinny sound and not as rich as the Lansing system. How can Bose even charge $100.00 for the system. Sorry Bose but I do not think you have a good valus here."
3,OK I finally bought them............,"I purchased these because of the good reviews. I shopped around a lot to see what was available. I have used logitec, altec and others. These speakers are OK, but not for the price. I plan to purchase an external sound card with better sound adjustments to help level out the digital sound and base. hopefully that will work. The cords for the speakers are a little short and placement of these speakers makes a huge difference in the sound quality you get from them. For real music listening I still use my JBL's but use these for internet radio [...]. Hoping I can find a sound card with remote control.Lisa Fenton"
4,"Great Sound, good value","Great sound quality and appears durable. Easy to use and set-up. Not the most stylish or aesthetically pleasing design, though. Good value."
4,addiction,"this game is for the ""organizer"" who doesn't have time to play a long drawn out action game. I've been addicted to this game for years. it's simple, challenging, and the rules don't change from level to level. something to play when you have a few minutes, or hours. not for those who like graphics and lots of action. but great for a quiet mind-activity game."
4,Classic Fun Game,Enjoyed this game when I was younger and was happy to find it again. If your a tetris fan then you may want to try Dr. Mario.
1,worst textbook ever!,"I am a senior in college and I have used and read many, many textbooks but this is the worst one ever! Very hard to read, the example are not explained very well, MANY< MANY typo's that are confusing to the reader. Many math examples and explanations are outright just wrong. Even professor says its an awful book.Should have never made it into college classrooms!!"
5,Class book,"This book is great if you are taking operation management course, it has helpful hints and it explains everything that you don't understand"
5,Required textbook for a class,"I rarely ever actually use my ""required"" textbooks for my classes except as a reference or maybe to clarify a point. However, for this particular class, there was no classroom instruction so I was required to actually sit down and open the book.I was pleasantly surprised! This text is straightforward, and the concepts are easy to follow. Instead of being written like the majority of other texts (in a way that seems like the author is just trying to prove his superiority and extended expertise in the subject matter), this text was truly written for the student who is trying to learn a new concept. Highly recommended."
3,Holy Moly!,"Dust off your calculus books because you'll need them!This text digs deep into OM. If you are looking for a softer, high level book, then this is not for you. If you want to delve deep into the mathematics behind the algorithm, you should be pleased."
5,Great resource!,I really enjoyed this book and found it to be a great resource for parachute play. This book has many different games and is descriptive about the game and the needs from the participants. I like how the book explains the purpose of particular movements or positions of the hands. It is a must have if you plan on doing parachute play often with a group of kids.
5,When Rap was about making money,These tracks on the CD took me back when there was little to no cursing in rap songs and were making people lose their minds with the creativity. A must have for ALL rap and hip hop heads.
4,Blast from the Past,"The tracks on this album are a blast from the past. In my opinion, there needs to be a volume 2. I feel that there are some other songs that could have been added to it (but that can just be done w/ a volume 2).Volume 2 should include things like Brand Nubian-Slow Down, Anything by MC Lyte, TCQ-Bonita Applebum, More KRS-One & Boogie Down Productions, Something by Eric B. & Rakim, Poor Righteous Teachers-Rock This Funky Joint, and Self Destruction as a bonus track (LOL)..."
5,Perfect for long airplane trips,"This worked great on our recent 10 hours of plane travel with our daughter. It's such a relief to not have to worry about battery life and charging the laptop in the airport. One suggestion: make sure you go to the iGo site to confirm that this adapter ships with the tip you need for your laptop, otherwise you will need to order the correct tip separately."
4,Favorite R&J,"This Romeo & Juliet is my favorite, for reasons stated by mr. Adcock atSergei Prokofiev: Romeo And Juliet, Ballet. In my own words I'd say that the reading is organic, human, it expresses feelings and tells a story which keeps me interested throughout the score.I am a little concerned about the sound quality. I get the impression that there is more in there, but it does not get through the speakers. But it might also have to do with my Hi-Fi equipment. I'd appreciate comments from other reviewers on this point.I also have the Karel Ancerl/CPO Romeo & Juliet excerpts. It is superior in many respects, but also quite different, so I just keep that one as well."
2,Decent interpretation marred by terrible intonation,"I had great difficulty restraining myself from turning this off when listening to it for the first time, because London does such a terrible job of being anywhere near in tune for much of it. Combined with many missed notes in the brass, messy passagework in the strings, and woodwind playing that seems intent on doing anything BUT creating any sort of phrase, it's doubtful this is worth even the small price Amazon has it listed for.For a budget recording of this that's actually decent, I'd be much more inclined to buy Naxos' release of the National Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine's version under Andrew Mogrelia."
3,Good looking product as long as you consider it disposable,"This product looks good on the jeep and is sturdy. I am on my 2nd set however, these rust very quickly, within a year or two it is totally rusted."
2,Current data misleading,"Dr. levy makes a fine effort in his book. However he fails to point out the differences in the current forms of vitamin C (there are different forms, some being actually harmful) and their efficacy and how some forms of vitamin C may actually promote disease such as cancer. One must use all tools to treat disease. Vitamin C being one of them. However, do not throw out the baby for the bathwater and embrace vitamin C as a cure all. It is not. This should be better emphasized and a more balanced integrative approach utilized. Remember, there are lives at stake here. This book is off track in many places. Patient be wary!"
3,No big deal!,"The Shea butter is a great product, but I feel you can get the same results with any regular lotion."
4,Nature's Best moisterizer,"The product itself is of excellent quality. However, $10 (plus shipping) is a little expensive for only 4 oz., which the amount was not advertized. I thought just putting a pic of the container was misleading, because I thought the jar shown would be larger. I previously bought 1 pound os raw shea butter (excellent quality) for $12. So I definately felt cheated."
5,Wonderful,This is the purest form of shea butter and I am on my second order. If you warm it in your hand for just a second it goes on wonderfully and I like the nutty fragrance. I feel great about using it.
5,Better Than Expensive Brands,"Great Karité Butter, smells great, naturally, without any perfumes; the perfect fresh nut smell.Great consistency, melts on contact, smoother than any unrefined karité butters I've tried.Better than the expensive (and very good) Shea Butter from L'Occitane."
3,Mmmm.... plastic.,"Shea butter is amazing stuff, but I would not recommend this one. As pure shea butters go, AAA shea butter is a bit on the greasy side - its doesn't absorb into skin well - and it smells like plastic. Next time I am looking for pure shea butter I will definitely try a different brand."
5,Good Product,"Good product especially for Expecting moms with dry skin. Works better than cocoa butter we think, especially since cocoa butter has a tendency to get rubbed off by clothing. This butter has a different texture and a little funny smell, which could put some people off (Though its not overpowering). But we do think it works well and sooths dry skin, especially since its unrefined and possibly has some of its healing properties intact."
3,Not for everyone!,"I have relaxed coarse dry hair. I heard nothing but good reviews on shea butter so I had to try it. Well let me just say that my hair does not like shea butter. It made my hair feel coated and just nasty. I tried it for apporximately two weeks and couldn't take it anymore. My skin had even started to break out everywhere my hair touched it. I am not sure why this happened because I use a sheabutter/oil mixture on my legs for softness and discoloration and that never broke me out. I am not going to say not to buy from this seller however, the product seemed authentic and was recieved in no time at all. It's just not the right product for everyone. Good Luck and Bleesings!P.S. I have been using jojoba oil and jamician black castor oil and had no adverse effects from them. If you're like me and couldn't use the shea butter give them a try."
1,Too Expensive for too little product!!!,"I bought and reviewed Shea on Amazon that looks and behaves like this special super secret Shea and i have to say this really is grossly over priced for the amount that you get. I wish I knew then what I know now. I paid $15 for 2 ounces of this product not realizing if I looked up ivory Shea butter I could pay $18 for 16 or so ounces of a similar product. It's the same color and consistency and is also raw/unrefined just like this product. If you believe in the merit of this product and company and what they do go for it, but I need to watch my wallet right now and will not purchase this again."
3,Didn't really like it,I didn't like the smell too much and it was very hard to spread. I like east African shea butter a lot better because its more of a liquid form and I don't have to microwave it to get it to spread more easily. It does provide a good amount of moisture but aside from that I didn't see any of the other benefits. I put it on my face and it made my face break out so I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
4,Unrefined Shea Butter,"I have been using shea butter for my face mainly. It is rich and lasts all day. I don't wear make up just mascara & liner. I like the cost and that it seems to protect my skin. I think it's protecting my skin from aging. Even though it doesn't have protection against the sun's rays I also use it all summer for day to day wear. At the beach I use a heavy duty sun protectant. This unrefined version of shea is a little grainy which I don't like but it's worth it if it is more pure and certified so. After rubbing it in my palms, it becomes pliable and smooth. If I apply too much I apply a very warm cloth and wipe some of the creme off. All in all I like the product; I have used it for about two years. It can also be used from head to toe for skin softening and care."
3,hustle,"Paula Froelich writes in It! about how to claw your way to the top. It's amusing and catty and disturbing. A lot of the people Froelich admires have made it in fame and cash but they're really horrible individuals who have done some really disgusting things. The section on how a certain socialite became a worldwide celebrity was particularly distasteful. F.Scott Fiztgerald once remarked that the rich are different than you and me and after reading It! all I can say is yeah, Scott, and thank goodness for that. The book left me cold."
3,These 9 Secrets Only Go So Far In The Real World,"I like to read career self help books and picked up this book because of the catchy title. Score one for Paula Froelich. The inside flap says ""...Paula Froelich has a true insider's knowledge of what it takes to attain stardom in any field."" Not true. Miss Paula is more concerned on giving you tips on how to make it in the entertainment industry while giving a list of what a public relation's employee should not do to get on her bad side.Buy this book only if you want entertainment tips and a little bit of celebrity gossip mixed in. Don't buy it if you want serious career tips."
2,Kind of Lame,I thought this would be full of interesting tips and an actual action plan. it wasn't. Just a collection of kind-of common sense ideas.
2,These secrets won't take you to the top,"As others have said, this book is definitely geared toward people who are just seeking fame or notoriety. It mostly just gives some anecdotes and details into the press and celebrities. The actual content basically says to work hard and be nice. It was slightly entertaining but definitely doesn't live up to the title."
2,A waste of time and money,"This book isn't very good and definitely isn't worth the money. First of all, most of the vice it contains is incredibly obvious. I don't think most people need to be told to take a shower every day. Second, it is almost completely about New York. If you don't happen to live in Manhattan, she doesn't have much interest in you. Third, it is incredibly self-centered. The author is a gossip reporter and the bulk of the book is about what people should do to make your job easier and save her time and money. If you are calling an item into her, you have to do it at a certain time, and on a certain day, or she will be too busy to deal with you. That kind of stuff. It doesn't seem to occur to Ms. Froelich that she has to do some work to earn her salary. Finally, the book contains an incredible amount of blatantly obvious name-dropping and brownnosing. She quotes her boss, at length, and writes at equal, pointless length about what a great guy he is, a genius and so on."
2,Fluff,"I excitedly bought this book, read it in one night, and felt it was only so-so. It's more like ""Who My Cool Friends Are"" or ""How to Be Connected..."" I did learn a few things from it, but most self-help books out there about well-being and gaining confidence can do that as well. You can clearly find out who Paula likes in this book when she's giving high praises about them (Liz Grubman? Yuck!). Well, overall, it's a fun book to read, and it's small enough to take to the beach and read it in an afternoon."
4,Love it!,"If you are looking for a fast read that will give you suggestions on how to make it, then this is the book for you!Ja-NaéWild Women Entrepreneurs President/Founder"
4,9 Secrets of the Rich and Famous That'll Take You to the Top,It's well written and the info moves quickly.
5,it! is the s*it!,"I recommend this book to anyone who can read. If you can't read, then buy the audiocassette.This book is more than just a beach companion because you can also read it in your house like I did. I plowed through the book like a farmer on speed. The contents were so engrossingly informative that I failed to notice that my building was on fire. Luckily I survived.If you devour Page Six for breakfast, then you will absolutely love the book. If you don't voraciously read Page Six on a daily basis, it's about time you relocate to planet Earth.Buy it so you can own a copy! Don't be cheap and wait for it to premiere on Cinemax."
4,A Must Own for Frida Junkies,"This is not a book that you read, per se. If you are looking for a biography or autobiography of Kahlo and want to find out about her life and times - this is Not the book.If you already have a lot of knowledge of Kahlo then this diary is a fantastic addition. It provides you with an insight into her mind, dreams and pain. The beautiful color reproduction of her actual drawing and writing is accompanied by a type-set explanation of her words.No scholar of Frida Kahlo should be without this amazing, gorgeous portfolio. It is inspiring on many levels."
5,all frida,"This is a really great window into Frida's mind. The forewords are really interesting. The book is a little short though, if you're used to reading long novels and such."
5,diary of Frida Khalo,"Fantastic illustrated diary, in her own handwriting an absolute must for all Khalo/Diego fans."
1,Spanish??,"I maybe didn't read the fine print and should have realized it would be in Spanish, but...I didn't and I don't speak Spanish. There is a translation in the back of the book, but that is a pain to be flipping back and forth all the time. I had seen the movie years ago, love diaries of any kind....well any kind I can read, but not this time. Buyer beware and find the small print I think."
1,flimsy,"The product arrived promptly. It is unbelievably flimsy. I am a small woman and yet I will be amazed if it lasts very long under any weight.It was difficult to get the metal to fit under the plastic tabs. My partner is strong and he gave up on it. I took a jewelry pliers and gently worked on bending the plastic to open it enough to accomodate the metal frame. So, I imagine I will get limited use from this but cannot recommend purchase to anyone."
3,Happy Camper/Hiker,"Had one of these items while in the military and it did come in handy. Beats trying to hover over a hole in the ground or trying to park one cheek on a log/rock and vigorously grasping the other cheek. Some of the items clips did break off, but that was rectified with duct tape. After a while the legs did tend to bend but that was rectified by having a friend weld some supports alond the legs. Balance for this item is not very good, so don't expect to read a newspaper while using this. Can be used with bags or you can get creative and dig a hole under you and play ""bombadier"". After a while the seat itself broke, but, again, that was rectified with duct tape. After a few years of using duct tape and other creative ways of fixing this item, I hit on the idea of cutting a hole into the seat of a folding chair (much more comfortable). This item is good for the quick use/day trip. Sometimes you get what you pay for. Good concept though."
4,Black Bass Review,"Black Bass fishing is an evergrowing sport. This game brought out alot of good ways to fish in real life too. If you like original titles this is the game for you. It gained my interest for a while but got harder, and most people don't like tough games but I recommend it to fishermen who just can't get to the lakes for whatever the reason. I hope this review helped you alot!"
3,Oh Bing,"Bought this cd for christmas songs for my truck when driving along, 3 stars only because of the limited songs."
4,Desert Strike,"pretty good game ,O.K. graphics ,a hard game to play but you'll get the hang of it.Desert Strike is about fling an Apache around blowing up stuff and saving stranded agents. I would recomend it.I would buy it if you're looking for a good action game."
3,It worked,The price was right . It was used as a night light for a very ill person to look at in the night for inspiration. The bulbs are a little hard to put in and out. It would be hard to work with for Chanukah. very light weight plastic
4,Please don't tell me it's the last one!,"Well, needless to say, I'm a huge Rex Miller fan! I read the first in the series, Slob, and I've been hooked!Rex Miller creates the ultimate bad guy who really evolves throughout the series. By the time you get to Butcher, you find yourself actually cheering Danny boy!The style and atmosphere created by Mr Miller is nothing short of riveting. I would reccomend that you start with Slob and work your way to Butcher. You won't be sorry.Mr Miller, please don't let this be the end!"
4,great travel wear,"I bought a couple of sets in different colors. The sizing on the rust-colored was smaller than the others, but other than that it was great."
5,great series...where is the rest?,"This was a great conclusion to a series available in the US currently. I am trying to collect this complete series (including movies), but so few are currently available in this country. The teen-aged detective, turned young child has really got interesting. new rivals, which make even this boy genius have to think hard about what happened. including one which is a Master of disguise which I really want to see how gets brought to justice. Come on, release the next few seasons for us fans in the states"
5,They Should Make More In English,"Since I don't understand fully Japanese yet, they should have made more Case Closed: Season 6 & on in English. I love Conan Edogawa/Jimmy Kudo persona."
2,"Forest Dreams... not exactly ""dreamy""","The video component of ""Forest Dreams"" is attractive. However, there is no option to view the video with natural sounds, and the accompanying audio track has a heavy percussive melody which does not seem to fit in well with the peaceful forest scenes. If you are thinking about purchasing this dvd as something to view for relaxation, you may be disappointed."
2,Looked like it was filmed by an amateur,"You know the saying you get what you paid for, well that is very true for this product. I purchased this used and it was very inexpensive, however this dvd looked like it was filmed by amateurs. I have seen better! It looked like someone from home took a video camera and just started filming. I don't hold the seller responsible at all since this did not come from the orginal makers of the product. But I did not like this at all. When you play it the sides jump too, as if I were watching on an old television. Do not recommend product at all, much better ones out there."
4,Practical and helpful,"The highlight of this book for me was the wonderful section on making herbal remedies: full color descriptions for crafting syrups, infusions, decoctions, tinctures, tonic wines, capsules, pessaries, compresses, poultices, infused oils, massage oils, ointments, creams, lotions, emulsions, and washes ... the beginning herbalist can feel comfortable knowing she is crafting safely and correctly ... and the A-Z of herbs helps make sure you're using the right plant!"
5,Gourd Fun for Everyone by Sammie Crawford,"Anyone who enjoys working with gourds will truely appreciate the effort that has gone into the making of this book. I especially appreciated the very detailed photographs that accompany each project in the book. Everyone, from novice to expert will find something of interest. The book is written in an easy to understand format and everything needed to complete each project is listed. An excellent addition to any collection of ""gourd"" books, exactly what I was looking for."
5,Easy crafting and creating for gifts or selling,"This book is easy to follow with great illustrations and instructions. The Native Americans use gourds for many things and often decorate them with early drawings of animals and native designs. Others, sometimes, just color them and add gold touches. Gourds come in many shapes and may be used for bird houses, baskets, containers, decorator items, etc. I've purchased a gourd from ""The Gourd Farm"" that looks like a SNAKE. Even the stem appears to be the snake's tongue. It will be so much fun to paint and place near the entrance to my home. They even make musical instruments by stringing wooden beads in a net fashion around them.Gourd painting isa lot of fun. I hope you'll give it a try."
2,Great glasses UNTIL they crack and leak!!,"CreativeWare Toni Set of Eight 24 Ounce Polycarbonate TumblersThis is the second set of these tumblers we've owned. The first set(purchased elsewhere)started cracking on the bottom after about a year. We're a family of 5 that used them every day, constant use. We decided to replace them and tracked them down to Amazon. The new set already has 3(of 8)cracking on the bottom(thus leaking!)after only 5 months of use. The box they come in claims they are of restaurant quality/strength. I wish that were true. We use them daily but they are well cared for, not abused. If they could find a way to keep them from cracking, these would be superb."
3,only place i could watch Josh Sneed perform!,I can't seem to find Josh Sneed to watch. i can only find his audio. I liked some of the comedians on this season but i was mostly in it to watch josh sneed. Who rocks by the way!
5,The Best of Pennick,"This glossy, oversized paperback is full of wonderful photos and graphics. It's wide reaching, although by necessity each chapter is brief. Pennick doesn't take the creative liberties one finds in many of his other books. This one is historically accurate and fascinating to read. It's not for runic scholars, but delightful for everyone else. I heartily recommend it."
5,wow,"ok to all the spoiled rich kids out the who say psp rules....be quiet this is a classic so yes it will have bad graphics but its vintage duh! this came out probably while who spoiled rich kids were suckin on a pacifier...so quit complaining about oo its black and white and its old......and it doest play new games....this system has the BIGGEST library of games out therethis system was my first gameboy and i loved it, id pick it up if u like calssic games ...pokemon, mario,zelda, the games that made nintedo great...but if you love gta or just cause or jak 1,2 or 3..i wouldnt bother, the sophistication of a gameboy pocket surpasses your intelligence..im a 13 yr old kid and i love it, so pick it up ONLY IF YOU LIKE CLASSICS ....pokemon red and gold are good, buy those too if u buy this system"
2,Get A Game Boy Advanced,This game system is handy when you are going somwhere boring. But has absloutly no color. (...) The games are very boring.I'm getting Game Boy Advanced for christmas. You should too. Don't get this system unless you want something boring. For your moneys worth.(...)
2,a 15 year old gamer,this gameboy pocket system isn't really all that i mean the color is not clear you can't hardly see it and when you play the games you can't really see it you have to bend down and everything to get a good view. i mean its okay when you area at school or at some boring place and you pull this boring crap out but when you play for awhile it starts to give you a headache on the concertration level of the screen. ohh this game is not totally worth the money at all. for all ya hardcore gamers out there i suggest not to pick this one i would consider for you to buy the gameboy advance if you looking for the coolest game out there right now.
2,the too old game boy pocket,I have this system since it first came out. I no longer play it because i have game boy advance . I no longer play it
3,Goooooood,"The gameboy I recieved is really cool. My only complaint is how often it randomly will die, but I am unaware of if that is the previous owner's fault of nintendo's. overall though I am really happy for making this purchase."
4,Love it,"I bought a used system (obviously) it came with a good condition screen, no battery cover, and stickers intact like said, the only problem is it deleted my pokemon games (I fix them, and still a teen), I was so far in blue yellow and gold, I was mainly sad about gold because it was the hardest I worked on completing a game, and it was the first I noticed deleted, which was depressing, and when I go to continue it says ""safe file is destroyed"" (or something similar) and I replaced the battery 3 months ago, so its the gameboys fault, I think there is just dust build up in the cartridge reader, so I took it apart and sprayed pressurized air in, and its been about 5 hours, and still has the same file saved, at 0:04 on gold, so I believe I fixed it, if not I'll take it to a game repair place here in town, but over all I love it, now all I need is the original gameboy, and a faceplate for my micro (20th anniversary edition), or I might break down and buy a new/used system of it."
3,Something for the New,"I got this some time ago, and I suppose I was thrilled with it since it was my first handheld, and it didn't seem a waste of time. You can change the color to change the darkness and lighting. It helps.But after a few years and I got the new generation handhelds: GBC and GBA, the fun wore off. Whenever I stared at the dull screen and I didn't have as much fun as I did playing the GBA. The induced graphics on the GBA were pretty much superior. But this system is great for new gamers who just want to try the handhelds. The games are compatible with the other GB generation systems. I recommend this to gamers who would like to have a little something of the past."
1,TOO OLD,"THIS GAME IS OLD. YOU CAN TELL BY THE BLACK AND WHITE GRAPHICS. REMEMBER THIS IS A GAMEBOY GAME, NOT COLOR OR ADVACE. SO MAKE SURE YOU REALLY WANT THIS GAME. I LIKE GAMES THAT U PRESS A BUTTON AND IT DOES A LOT LIKE UNO, MONOPLY, SCRABBLE, BRAIN GAMES AND BOARD GAMES."
5,Impressive!,"I was skeptical at first, but after Implementing this book my 5 year old has shown dramatic improvement!!! Everyone, including his teacher has noticed a difference. It's a difficult transition, but well worth the sacrifice."
1,This book was of no use to us,"We made the changes that were suggested, but found no effect on our child's behavior (which is only mildly hyperactive).It appears some people have success with this, and that's great. Note however: it is VERY difficult to follow this diet in a family where only one child might need it.Personally, I believe that following your kid around and critiquing every morsel of food that goes into his mouth, drives everyone crazy."
4,Worth the Read!,"I'm amazed with the statistics showing the number of people/children with ADHD these days. 30 years ago, I bought this book for my daughter who had been diagnosed Hyperactive. Dr. Feingold was way ahead of his time with his theory. After reading this book, I was able to take my daughter off Ritalin and had major success with his diet. What a shame that so many in the medical community are still claiming his theory ""unfounded"". I would strongly recommend any parent, at least give this a try first before going the medication route. This is the third one of these books I've purchased over the years. Each of the others I've given to friends, and this one is loaned to another friend.Lorna Lyerly"
4,"Overlong, but good for trade","Pruett's attempt at expanding what could have been a chapter in an academic text into a self-help book for the masses is admirable. Yes, I think fathers and fathers-in-waiting should skim the book. Some sloppy work: doesn't the author know the difference between Penn and Penn State? But overall, makes a good case, if you can excuse the gratuitous fawning over ""single mothers."" The ""as you'll read in the next chapter"" stuff was annoying."
4,very good,"It says something of our culture that we need books noting that fathers are important to parenting. This was no surprise to my parents, or their parents, but somehow it is now. This book is well researched, and offers good, tight argument in favor of fathers as parents, with useful ideas. It has a little more research and less how to than I would have liked. My favorite book on parenting is currently only available in German, titled something like Blossoming the Child, I understand it will come out in English next year. I won't repeat what other positive reviewers said.Strong Fathers, Strong Daughters: 10 Secrets Every Father Should Knowis also very good."
5,Superb Book,"Dr. Pruett deals with the essential need for fathering in a warm, thoughtful, easily readable form. A must read for all parents."
3,about the DVDfilm Friday Night..........,"The story is basically about the intimate encounters (only) of a woman picking up a man in her car during the traffic Jam (due to transportation strike).....that's all....Friday NightReview wriiten by:Dr, MR Franc MBBS (PhD) GPS Ang Poon Kah"
1,Pretty bad,"Okay, I'm a big Claire Denis fan--the sublime ""Chocolat,"" ""Nenette and Boni,"" even ""Beau Travail""--but this one is worse than pretty bad, really. It's downright awful. All, that is, but the stunning opening shot over the roofs of Paris."
3,What's missing...?,"Typically with these 'Greatest Hits' or 'Best of' compilations, they always leave one out. In this case it's 'Morning Glory'.With it, this CD would be 5 stars perfect, but its omission is a real fly in the ointment for me."
1,Don't buy McLean's X factor tape,I responded to a promotional message for Jim McLean's Ultimate X factor DVD with the expectation that this would be the latest idea for achieving a better golf swing. What I got instead was what appeared to be a DVD dub of an old VHS tape training from the 1980s. I paid too much for old ideas and poor quality visuals.Jim McLean's Ultimate X Factor (2 DVD SET)
3,Not EXACTLY what I wanted,This was a gift so I can't fairly rate it. However I 'settled' for this CD because I could not find the one I was looking for which I believe had a blue cover.
4,The Legend of Tommy Jo Sanchez,"I have just finished reading this western. I was drawn to this book because it was written by a local author. I didn't know what to expect since the writer is a South Carolinian writing about Tombstone Az. I found The Legend of Tommy Jo Sanchez very entertaining. It will make you laugh out loud and shed a few tears. It's got what every summer read should have. I am looking forward to a sequel. Tommy Jo is a personality that you can't forget.D. HartlineBlythewood, SC"
4,"Good value, but...","I just bought one of these a few days ago. It's fun to build and detailed. Few complaints though. After I built it the joints became a little loose. I'm not sure if this was the kit or because I did something wrong, or what. Also, it's not very durable and some parts look ready to break. Other than that, it's very cool looking (when the arms, legs, and head aren't flopping around) and would be fun to play with and display if not for the joint and small parts problems. If it were up to me, I'd spend a bit more and buy the Endless Waltz 1/144 Heavyarms Custom (which I plan to do soon). The Endless Waltz version is much cooler looking and is alot more detailed. I have an Endless Waltz Serpent Custom and it is very detailed and sturdy. If you're looking for value, buy this one. If you want durability and detail, buy the Endless Waltz version."
4,Cool Robot,Heavyarms is a machine gun robot. He is very strong and I like his pilot. He has 3 machine guns. He can fly too. I have been building Gundams for about 2 months. They are really fun to build. But you can't really play with them. There's still more that I need but I know some day I'll get them all.
4,Heavyarms Overview,"All in all this TOY was pretty good. It is preaty durable and fun. Even though well I was puting it together part of the chest plate broke. It isn't to challenging, but this was my third Gundam model. Well I was puting it together part of the chest plate broke. It isn't very educational. If you like this model you should try Epyon and Shenlong which are a little harder than Heavyarms. Still, all in all this is a good toy."
2,This gundam stinks don't buy it!,I was very disaponted when I finished building this Gundam it's head was very flimsy and fell off alot. I also had a hard time getting it to stand up. Once you got it's head to stay on and it to stand up it looked ok but you couldn't play with it becouse it was so flimsy. Don't buy this it is a rip off.
4,max heavy,"This model kit is afun model it needs some glue thoe.Its ears dont stay on very well .Its very durable ,doesnt stand very well.When you set him up he falls alot ,so you need to lean him agist something."
4,hehehe....out done themselves again...,"Wow...what else can i say? it may not be all good to play with, but with a good paint job, maybe some battle damage too, he is one of the best."
5,"Heavy arms, Heavy Guns, Heavy Action",This gundam is Tite as any other Gundam its only down side is its hard to keep the gattling gun on sometimez but this is one of the best next Mercurius
3,"This gundam is cool, unless he breaks","This model is alright. I had problems putting his chest plates on, and one of them broke while trying to put it together. The only other problem is that his gatling gun doesn't stay on his arm very well. Besides that this toy is VERY KEWL"
5,Gundam's RULE !!!!!,This is the 5th gundam model that I have bought. So far I think this is the best model. It is very well articulated(Especially for the 1/144 scale model). I have had no problems with it falling apart or breaking. On a scale of 1-10(one being the worst)I would give it a 10!
1,This toy Stinks,"Ihate this model,because it's parts fall apart way to easly. When I play with it it'legs and gun fall off the second you touch it. I don't recomend it at all."
4,You won't have to listen to the others after you hear this,"The toy is prety good, if you wnat it to become better and more authentic then get some paint. The best thing about heavy arms is that he's a two-type fighter both offensive and defensive, and also hes long range and short range. The only problem is the legs and arms get limp after a little while, but all of the models do that. all in all he's one of the sweetest gundams around."
2,A lousy Gundam model,"I've been building Gundam models since 1996, and I've built everything from Low Grades up to Master Grade models, from almost every Gundam series, Wing, Seed, Victory, Turn A, Universal Century, etc. and the Low Grade Wing models are some of the worst models I've built. My Heavyarms has very bad lower body articulation, the proportions are all off (it's head is approx 20% larger than my Strike Gundam's head, despite the Heavyarms being a smaller mobile suit) and has a horrid color scheme. I needed a lot of paint just to get this Gundam to look good. At the end, I just gave up and kitbashed all my Wing models. My suggestion is to buy some decent High Grade models, such as the HGUC line of Mobile Suits, or if you have the money or the time, to buy some Master Grade Mobile Suits. Don't bother wasting your money on this kit"
1,dont bother,"of all the 1/144`s from wing,this is by far the absolute WORST!i had to waste half a bottle of glue on this thing.it needs far to much paint for a 1/144.im gonna bash this one,along with my other wing kits. spend your money on a good kit,like the hguc`s or at least an EW 1/144."
5,Awesome,"I cannot wait to teach my children to read using this method. My friend taught her daughter to read using this book when she was four years old, and now as a seven-year-old, she's at the top of her class and excels in learning everything thrown at her. The ideas that the author has for gaining the attention of your little one are fun and rewarding. I also like the fact that you are not teaching your children how to say each letter, but how each letter sounds. She gives a day by day lesson plan and sample stories for your child to read. I highly recommend this book."
2,Filler,"I was disappointed by the content of this book. Only 2 chapters are dedicated to actual phonics-based learning. And more than 6 list the numerous ways in which to bribe your child into cooperation.Also, I found that a key step of blending individual sounds into syllables and words is conveniently glossed over. As if it is so easy that any child will 'get it' instantaneously.It wasn't helpful. It was redundant and self-promoting. I would have had better luck just getting information off the internet than purchasing this book."
4,Awesome!,This book really works! Very informative and very easy for Moms and Dads to teach your toddler to read.I am working with my 2.5 year old. He is actually getting it. The book talks about a game to play with your child and my son asks for that game several times a day. He is actually sounding out words and we have been working with the book for only a few weeks.
1,Train your child to read... just like you train your dog!,"So basically, this book is telling you to make a contraption out of egg cartons, put a ""treat"" in each one and feed it to your child as they say each sound. Repeat, over and over making it a little harder at a time, and then they will read.Also, set up your ""reading area"" like a party space, you are supposed to make a whole show of it.You start out making your child teach a stuffed animal to read, which my 5yr old thinks is incredibly dumb (even though he has a great imagination, he isn't stupid, he knows he can't really teach a toy something)Is it possible to return a book because of how awful it is? This was a huge waste of money."
4,"Great fishing RPG,","A great fishing sim. It has some high and low points though. Finishing the quests can take alot of guesswork in the later areas. The combat system seems hacked in and doesn't add much to the game (and because your attack strength is based on your hitpoints it can easily be a downward spiral). It's very relaxing though to let the current drag you around and to cast about randomly for fish to sell for money. All in all, if you like to figure things out on your own, this is a great game. It can get frustrating at times though."
1,Wheel of Fortune Review,It is an interseting game but they ask the same question over and over and it gets really boring. It's really dumb. Do not buy this game.
1,VERY disappointed :(,I was excited to receive this game only to be disappointed. I wouldn't waste your money. The graphics are absolutely horrible and the game processes very s--l--o--w--l--y!!!
5,GREAT GAME FOR PEOPLE WHO LIKE GAMES!!,I THINK THIS IS A GREAT GAME FOR THE GAMEBOY SYSTEMS.EVEN THOUGH THE GRAPHICS ARE NOT THAT GOOD.THE GAME IS FUN TO PLAY.
2,Needs to be more realistic,"Have to type too much, and the little stick figure of Vanna is disappointing. Higher technology makes this a simple, basic choice now."
2,quality is slacking,"image quality is below par. without even trying, I'm sure they could have done better. I do not know why, they put out such low quality images"
2,Problem with low dimming,"I ordered three of these switches and they all have the same problem with low range dimming not working. To get a dim light, I have to turn it almost all the way up and then carefully come back down. Very annoying."
2,Not so dim a dimmer,"This dimmer has a minimum amount of current that it will let through, and as a result the dimmest you can make your light fixture is about 25% of the maximum wattage. If you are looking for a dimmer that will allow you to dim your lights to almost nothing before shutting off, this is NOT the dimmer for you."
4,Well-organized with good detail,"The book starts with some good test taking strategies and the content review is concise and well organized. Even though there was only one test per assessment area this book covered--I took the book's suggestion and took all of the tests since there is so much overlap in subject area.I haven't taken the test yet, but I'm feeling much better about it after using this book. I definitely recommend it."
2,a little confusing,"This book is a little confusing. For example, it states that certain tests are covered by certain chapters, but the chapters aren't clearly marked. In the table of contents, the book is divided into parts with each part further divided into several sections. It took me a long time to figure out that those sections where the chapters. I'm in my seventh year of college. I'm an English major and am obviously planning on being a teacher. It made me feel totally stupid that I couldn't figure out what the chapters were. Furthermore, when I'm already frazzled about taking the most important test of my career to date, the last thing I need is to worry about whether I'm studying the right section in the book I bought specifically to make studying easier. All in all, I am very underwhelmed with this book and wouldn't recommend it."
1,PraxisII English Subject Area,This book is not useful at all in studying for PraxisII. Buy the study guide from ETS. The information ETS has is more of what is on the test. There was not one thing out of this Cliffs book that was on the test.
3,quick review,"I already took the test (0041) and failed by 8 points. I discovered that it wasn't necesarily the content of the english content knowledge praxis 2. It was that fact that I ran out of time before I finished, so I basically guessed for the next 15 questions. My advice is, work fast! Praxis study guides are scams; however, the tests are good so you can get a feel for the speed. 120 mins flys when you're having fun panicking to get it done. Good luck!"
3,Good price but faulty,"Glad I purchased it because it gave me a general idea of what would be on the Praxis 41 (English Content Knowledge)for much less than other prep materials I considered, and that's all I was really looking for; but several of the questions and answers in the practice test had glitches in them (possibly printing/publishing issues) so be cautious about relying on the answers for substantive content information. The general test-taking recommendations were fine, but very basic and generic -- if you're taking a Praxis II, do you really still need this kind of stuff?"
1,Paid for Incorrect Answers!!!!!,"I purchased the book Cliff Test Prep Praxis II: English Subject Area Assessment expecting that it would prepare me for the Praxis. Well while I was studying I discovered at least two questions in the practice test for th e 0041 section that gave incorrect answers! At first I was like what are the odds that a praxis prep book is incorrect, but then after confering with several English majors, I discovered that I was right and the book was in fact displaying incorrect answers. I have not recieved my Praxis scores yet, but I am seriously concerned. I passed the Praxis for general Content Knowlegde (0014) in June and I passed with 177 on my first try- but for that I used the ETS Prep book. Seriously, if you are reading this please buy the ETS book, not this one!!!"
3,Just took the Praxis 2,"This is the only book that I used to study for the Praxis 2 in Middle School English. I read a number of reviews and glanced through quite a few other books. This one seemed to be the most focused on my subject test and the cheapest. It has a helpful review section of grammar, literary terms, novels to be familiar with, literary periods, and pedegogy. There are also example responses to the essay questions, and I found those very helpful as well. I took every practice test in the book to prepare for the Middle Grades test, but only 2 of the tests were really helpful since the other ones forcused on different skills. I felt very prepared for the test overall and I'm just awaiting my scores!"
4,A thorough Guide,"This guide was put together well. The first section provides an overview of what to expect for each section and how each should be approached. The second section provided the specific content. It was organized by test so one could easily find the pertinent sections. This was followed by practice exams. The answer sections were particularly well done. These included a section that listed the correct answer, the topic being addressed, and the chapter in which that topic was covered. Additionally, there was a detailed rationale provided for each question. Lastly, there was a ""Final Tips"" section which, among other things, provided a long list of works that might be included on the essay questions. Overall, I thought the guide was well-written and comprehensive. I'm taking the test in 2 days - hopefully I won't feel differently afterwards!"
5,Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I used this book to study for the Middle School English Test(0049). I found it to be helpful in most aspects but on a test like this the book can not possibly cover every single aspect. It does cover a great portion and I would recomend this book to anyone who needs a study guide fast. (I only prepared for the test for about a week and a half.)
4,Sample test is not a good example of real test,"This book appeared to be perfect ""everything guide"" to the Praxis English subject area test. It was very helpful, especially in providing a good overview of basic information. The sample tests for exam 0041 led me to believe there was more lit. but test takers beware, after taking the exam, I've learned that literature is only about half of the 120 questions. The rest are grammar and composition and rhetoric. I wish that the practice exam in both this guide and actually, the one from ETS too, had been more representative of the actual test.I must note that the inside of the book has a chart that correlates with the actual exam. It breaks down the percentages of literature, grammar, etc. rather accurately. I am only commenting that the practice exam in the book had more literature portions even for the questions about composition and rhetoric and language. This part is the only part that was not like the actual test."
2,Agree with Princess Buttercup,"The overview sections are good, but the review above is dead-on: obviously the person who edited this book was not an English major! After taking the practice test and getting what seemed like way-too-many answers wrong, I went question by question and found at least 3 blatant errors and another one or two that are questionable. I'm glad I'm not the only one who noticed! Makes me very distrustful of the book. How am I supposed to rely on this book to help me prepare for an important test, when the authors/editors don't seem to know any more than I do?"
3,Good study guide but has at least one wrong answer in Practice Test,"Do not use this booklet as your only study guide. Some of the questions are irrelevant and/ or ambiguous. In the 0041 practice test, the answer to number 45 is completely wrong. It also looks like Dr. Kern didn't edit the explanation of the answer for this question as well."
4,good review book,"I took the test this weekend, and I felt that this book had good information and a great practice test that was representative of the actual test I took. It was organized well and had good information."
5,Great Preparation,This guide is very informative and very helpful. Would recommend this product to anyone seeking assistance with their exam!
1,Very poor product!,"Terrible product. The book has many errors, which is inexcusable for a test prep test. The text keeps referring to chapter numbers (""See chapter 12"") and there are NO numbered chapters or chapters about what is being referred to. Font type and size change randomly throughout. Whole sections which are misplaced/out of order with the surrounding text. Wow is this a terrible product!"
2,NOT A GOOD STUDY GUIDE,I thought that studying the information in the book would prepare me for the test but once I got the test the information that was in the book was not even close to what I had studied in the book. The book basically outlines what you need to study but I needed more. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I was blown away by the content that was on the test and the content that I studied and I felt like the two didnt compare. The Cliffnotes book made it seem like the test was really easy and it watered down the information that would be on the test. But there isnt a lot of books offered on this content area so its like what other choices do you have but to buy the book. It was a waste of money!!!!
3,Not very helpful for essay test,"I used this book to study for both the 0041 and 0042 tests. This book really helped with the 0041 test- I got 190/200 correct. It did not help with the essay test at all, though. The book gives sample questions and sample answers, but did not explain what made some answers better than others. I ended up not meeting the required score for my state, even though I knew the study guide inside and out. If you need a study guide for the essay test, don't get this book."
2,buttons alright for some crafting,Got better quality buttons that these looked like from Joanns for the same price. These aren't bad for the price
4,NO MORE DRAMA!,"NOT ANOTHER DAY INFORMS IT'S READERS TO LIVE NOT BY THE WORLD'S STANDARD BUT BY GOD'S TIMING.

2,misleading advertising copy,"The Amazon advertising on-screen copy states that the bench is made to hold 300 lbs. When the bench is put togethr, the attached written material states that the weight limit is 250 lbs. The bother of returning the bench and ordering another was not worth the time or energy."

1,poorly made,"The cork set arrived with chipped paint, looking a bit used. I would not buy from this vendor again."
4,A fascinating alternative to Karajan.,"It's illuminating to play these recordings alongside the 1960's H V Karajan recordings. With the orchestra and recording technology identical, one can fairly compare the conductors, and in most instances, I would favor Cluytens.Among the recordings of Beethoven from the late 1950's to mid-sixties, I would prefer Szell, Ormandy (some of which have never appeared on cd), or for a radically different viewpoint, Bernstein. The Cluytens has the edge over Klemperer, Bohm and Masur, as well as the 60's Haitink and Kareajan recordings. Can't beat the current price, either."
1,Beware of ordering these CD's!,If you plan on using these CD's in a Bose radio--do not order them. The first CD I put into my Bose radio became stuck and is not able to be ejected. I have to send my radio into Bose for them to extract the CD and it is going to cost me $100. I am very distressed about what has happened to my Bose player. It is not worth damaging your machine for a $20 CD set. The Bose people said the same thing could happen with a car CD player. I called Amazon and they very kindly offered me a $30 gift certificate for my problem.
4,Dark Horse,"If you like Beethoven as read by Klemperer, Barenboim, Carlos Kleiber and the incomparable Furtwangler, then you will very likely enjoy the late Cluytens' cycle. If you are looking for your first Beethoven cycle (all nine symphonies) then this is a highly recommended starting point. Personally, I began with Klemperer and the Philharmonic - and still feel this is one of the best cycles. If you want a sense of Furtwangler - rated by many (including me, obviously!) as the greatest modern conductor - then look out for his 5th and 7th with the VPO on EMI. The sound is quite adequate and the price compelling, whereas the more dramatic war time recordings suffer from atrocious sound quality (1940s wartime,after all). Cluytens is a solid even majestic cycle."
4,Classic,"I was so pleased to come across the CD release of this old recording. I have a CD of a cassette tape of a reel-to-reel tape from the 60s and it's my standard. This recording finds all of these magnificent singers at their best, and Mme. Jones is here sans wobble which accompanies her later in her career. My only regret is M. Fischer-Dieskau. His singing is lovely as ever, if a bit too lovely for the music, but one misses a real bass (or bass/baritone) in this role. The chorus and conducting are fine. What I love about this recording is the straight-forward playing and singing which this chestnut needs. A more recent Elijah with Bryn Terfel and Renée Fleming is unfortunately marred by someone's idea of ""drama"" (I guess the conductor, Paul Daniel). On this terrible version, the chorus yells and ""emotes"" and goes way over the top, as do the soloists. Elijah is not grand opera, Mr. Daniels. In any case, if you want a standard, most excellent version of Elijah, I highly recommend this recording."
5,"Elijah,","Cette version d'Elijah, malgré son ge, est vraiment extraordinaire. Fisher-Dieskau en est srement pour quelque chose..."
2,Not so good,Too much emphasis on the lesbian aspect.....not enough about gay men in the same situation.
2,With new adhesion- it's great!,"I was looking for a feeder that could outsmart the wicked squirrels in my backyard. This one seems to do the trick- only because I can hang if from a window where they have no access. :)I gave it 2-stars because the suction cups are worthless. The feeder fell twice in the first hour, and the perch was broken the second time. I decided to take matters into my own hands! Using 2 Contact-brand hooks (I recommend these, specifically ...) I re-hung it and have had no problems!Great concept- just needs a new method of adhesion!"
5,Birds love this feeder!,"I had one of these for three years. Finally, in a brutal cold snap the suction cups failed, it fell off a second story window and broke. I ordered three more and put one up right away. It may have been the cold but this one fell and broke right away. I read the Amazon reviews and copied the reviewer who used industrial Velcro to attach the feeder - great idea! I now have two of these on my window and I have chickadees, goldfinches, nuthatches, cardinals and hairy and downy woodpeckers - all right in the middle of the city! The feeder detaches easily to fill and holds a lot of different seeds - at this price give it a try."
5,Bird's Eye View,"I really like this bird feeder. I found similar ones at Walmart and tried several, disappointed with all of them. They were cheap plastic that came with cheaper suction cups that never held up.This bird feeder has been stuck to my window for over a year and hasn't budged. Birds continue to visit and eat, bringing a smile to my face whenever they appear.An excellent way to appreciate birds without leaving your recliner. Great price-give it a shot."
2,It was good for 5 months until it fell once.,I enjoyed it while it was up but now I know to just buy a higher quality the first time around. I'll probably end up with a stand (quality and sturdy of course) and hang multiple feeders on it. I was disappointed it couldn't even stand one fall to the ground. The suction was fine to hold up with a full load (just clean the suction cups and your window).
5,Garden Song 101-4 Dine Around Window Bird Feeder,"I really like this product. I've read other reviews and I just think these people didn't know how to mount it correctly. Easy, clean window, lightly moisten suction cups, stick on window, mount feeder. I live on the 8th floor of a high rise and its very windy at times and it snows and rains hard, zero problems here!"
4,Easy to refill and keeps the little birds happy!,"This spiffy little feeder is pretty well designed with lots of space for small birds to occupy and 3 ports for seed. You can easily remove it from the window to refill it -- the feeder lifts off the suction-cupped support. I like to open the top and fill it where it is, but that made me realize that the curve of the top prevents it from staying open, so I have to use two hands to refill it. It's also made for small seed combos only-- sunflower seeds are too big for it.The little birds love it!"
1,Didn't stick to the window.,I was really sad and if I had bought it at a store I would have taken it back. I only filled it up half way and it was so heavy that the suction cups had no chance of holding it to the window. I was also upset that there where no instructions with it. I had to guess that I put the suction cups on correctly. There is no way this feeder full is going to hang on your window. I am hoping we can rig it up somehow to sit on the railing of our deck.
5,Very Happy with this feeder,"This feeder arrived on time and in perfect condition, thanks again Amazon for another smooth transaction. As I live in central michigan and have almost permanant snow cover(at least it seems that way in early Feb) within 2 minutes of filling and hanging this feeder I had hungry birds on it! It is on our sliding glass window and the view of the birds is awesome. The only thing I noticed is the physical dimensions of the feeder are such that the largest bird I have seen on it is a female cardinal, the males are slightly to large to get on it. The unit is very stable and firmly attached. It remains to be seen how it will handle a good blow.I can recommend this feeder."
1,The birds hate it,"I bought one of these at Walmart. Don't bother to order it. Don't bother to go to Walmart to get one. It is small, which is not necessarily bad. It is inexpensive, but you get what you pay for because it is cheaply made. The birds will not feed from it. I have another style feeder in my yard with the same bird food in it as this one and they turn their beeks up at this feeder and eat out of the other one. The greasy spoon of bird feeders. Keep shopping."
2,You get what you pay for...,"This was my first bird feeder. I was so excited to see what kind of birds I would attract. I purchased this last summer, and it has been thrown in the dumpster as of last month. Its plastic, and light weight. The suction cups on the back are not strong enough to hold up the light weight item. It fell off my window a few times, and when it got cold it out for the winter... it eventually just fell into the snow bank to be uncovered in the upcoming summer. When I put the food into the feeder, it was messy. The food fell everywhere, and it was not easy to insert. If you moved it at the wrong angle, food would go everywhere! This is good for a beginner, but if you have more money... go buy something better!"
2,Gets jammed constantly,"I've had this feeder for a couple months. It's pros are that it holds a lot of seed and doesn't fall off. The con is that it is constantly getting jammed with larger pieces of seed (sunflowers, peanuts, etc). I have to take it off and unjam it at least every two days, or I get no birds. Not worth the money."
1,Broken product,Not sure how the product is because it came broken. It was packed in the shipping box pretty terrible. Still waiting on my refund.
2,Not what it appears,"When I received the feeder and put seed in it, I realized that the only seed that works in it is THISTLE SEED. I did not know this when I bought it. I would prefer it to be a general 'any seed' type feeder."
4,Good affordable choice,"We don't have anywhere to hang a bird feeder outside our house that's near a window, so we decided to put one on the window. So far this feeder has worked great and attracted mostly cardinals and sparrows (we live in an urban/suburban area so I'm not expecting much).PROS: Affordable, very easy to fill, easy to stick on the window pane, and the feeder part unhooks from the suction part for refilling (no sticking and unsticking).CONS: This is more of a personal preference, but it's plastic. If I could have found a comparable wooden feeder I would probably have gone with that."
2,Not good for sunflower seeds,I only tried this feeder with sunflower seeds which does not work very well. Frequently the seeds get stuck above the bird's feeding port. This requires the feeder to be shaken to allow additional seeds to fall within the bird's reach. It probably would work fine with small seeds.
2,Bought it and it broke.,The suction cups must have been defective. It kept falling off the window and finally the base broke. Cheap plastic!
1,Not For Me,"I had this feeder. It seemed the perfect solution to keeping the squirrels out. I prepared the glass and installed the feeder. I didn't fill it all the way up because I was afraid it would be too heavy. Two days later, it fell off the window and broke when it hit our deck. That was the end of that. It obviously was not strong enough to hold. I will look for something with more substantial suction cups."
2,Did not stay up,"This attractive bird feeder has suction cups to hold it on the window, but it did not stay up, fell off, and broke. I would opt for more hanging feeders instead. Put a bracket on the wall above your window and let a hanging feeder hang down in front of your view. Also remember that you can't hang this type of hanger on your window if you have a full screen on the outside. It would also be difficult to do if you have a half screen or storm window that must be raised and lowered if reaching out from inside to hang it outside."
5,red polls watch out!,"I ordered this last fall. Chickadees occasionally had a snack. But then the common red poll showed up last week. We haven't had any in several years due to some disease in the wild. I had just a bit of niger seed because the pine siskins like it. I ended up with about 20 red polls, and after they threw all the sunflower seeds on the ground from the chickadee feeder, they all converged at once on this one.The fighting, the screeching, the threats of divorce or murder, you'd think they had never seen food before. And then, when I refilled it the next day, they started fighting over it and pulled it right off the window. I'm not sure who was more shocked, me of the red polls. So I refixed it today, and they are very very happy and piggy.And that means the chickadees and nuthatches can return and not be overwhelmed. I am ordering another one, since I don't know who long the feeder can handle the assaults..."
5,my birdies love it,"this is the feeder of choice for the little birdies, easy to fill, just flip up the top, and sticks well to my window never had a problem even with some recent high winds."
2,Can't get the birds to stay and eat,"The birds will stop and take a seed or two, but they won't stay and eat. Maybe as winter gets colder they'll stay longer, I don't know. If they do, I'll come back and change my review. Right now, I'm disappointed. I've had this up for 2 months and the birds hardly use it at all."
2,Not enough stick-to-it-iveness,"If you like having birds feed right at your window, the Dine-Around is great...for as long as the two suction cups stay suctioned. A full feeder and two bluejays or starlings trying to get at the seed will bring it crashing to the ground. If you could insure only chickadees hear about the food, you'll love it."
1,10 minutes.,I put this feeder - empty - with no bird/s sitting on it on my window and within less than 10 minutes it had fallen to its ultimate death. Not worth the money.
1,Horrible feeder!,"I purchased this feeder, put in on the window, and it fell off and broke in 1 day...Not worth the money folks, it is cheap!"

1,Did not work,The one we received was defective and did not work. Looked poorly made. Should have worked -- a simple enough device -- but it didn't. Having to return it.
5,Makita still maintaining their quality,"Have been using this for about 2 months. Only used an impact driver once prior to buying this, but that convinced me to buy one. I tend to buy Makita tools (also own some Milwaukee). This combo set is great. I mainly use the impact driver for installing cabinetry. It is light enough to use one-handed, freeing up your other hand for positioning the work; it is simultaneously powerful enough to drive just about any screw into any material- without breaking it. Furthermore, it has relieved some elbow tendonitis by making the screw-driving process less laborious. The MForce drill is also a great power driver in and of itself."
5,Handles long screws well,"I had doubts about how a 14.4v driver would do on deck screws, but I don't any more. It does great. The lighter weight than an 18v is nice. Since I refuse to by NiCad battery powered tools for environmental reasons that ruled out several of the other top brands. I am happy with my other Makita cordless tools, although after years of abuse I broke my 18v drill (beware of repeatedly using them for large spade bits and hole saws).The fluorescent light is nice too. I hope I don't break it."
4,Revised review,"Both tools have held up well. I do have a few gripes. The flashlight switch stopped working after only a few weeks Love the new drill but I still like my older 9v impact better for its size. Batteries are really losing charge duration. I just discovered a national chain in the area which replaces the battery cells of your originals for half the price of a replacement (~$30 vs. $60+) I will still look first to Makita for my next drill however I think more torque would be better for using 0.5"" chuck bits and a variable trigger to get screws started on the impact. I still need a good LED or FLR low consumption rechargeable area light that can withstand daily use. Any suggestions?"
2,Batteries didn't last long,I own an 18 Dewalt impact and bought the makita for the lighter weight. Did not have the power of the Dewalt and both batteries are totally dead after a year and a half.I thought these batteries were better than the Dewalt but my Dewalt's are still going well.
3,Worked great for a while !,"I have had this set for about a year now, Have no complaints about the drills themselves. The impact driver has tons of power for such a light tool and having the extra drill is a bonus to so you dont have to change bits and tips. It gets used on the job every day, and had worked flawlessly till the past week or so. Now one of the batteries has just completely died out of nowhere. It will not take a charge at all. I have older drills that have taken a lot more abuse, and keep on going. I was going to buy another one of these sets, the price seemed to good to be true. I guess I should have just bought the Panasonic."
1,Amazon sent an older model and not the one pictured.,The drill I ordered arrived very quickly. This was my third purchase from Amazon and Like one prior came with the outer carton destroyed. Seems like Amazon shipping department rations the packing tape and the taped seams failed. The drill I was sent was an older model with the clam shellcase and not the one pictured in the item description. I did email and explain my problem which amazon responded to quickly. Amazon said that they were sorry for the mistake and offered a refund. I was also told the mistake was corrected on the web site and the description was updated to reflect the actual product. I just wanted to mention they did not change the item description or the item picture so if you purchase this drill you too will get the same model I did and not the current one pictured. I know this not a big deal to most but replacing both older batteries in 5 months will cost you half the price you paid for the drill.
5,Need Vs. Want,"Now this is what I'm talking about Daddy-O! I didnt need it, but I wanted it! Now I got it, and I cant stop playing with it! I love it! Feel the power! Off to build the perfect Beach Cabana now! :)"
5,great product,"just bought mine for more at home depot. thought i had a good deal until i saw it here on amazon. anyways, works great. more power than i will ever need. battery charges pretty quick. last really long compared to the old craftman drill that i had. really recommend this over craftman's. but then again, my craftman is really old and was only 12v. but i'm really happy with this product. it's also a well trusted brand."
5,Excellent combo for the money,I love this set I picked up. You cant beat it for the money. The impact wrench is so light and versatile. Plenty of power also. The light that comes with it is also very handy. Just an all around great deal and with the Makita name how can you go wrong.
5,Love it,"Its an awesome combo for an awesome price. I had never used a cordless impact driver before this one, and this one is really awesome, great speed control, plenty of power, and the LED that lights up when you squeeze the trigger is a nice touch. The worklight is great too, it runs for a surprisingly long time with the flourescent bulb and is really bright. No complaints with the drill either."
5,Superior Impact Driver and Drill,"Makita has done it again. I've had this Drill and Impact Driver combo for about a month and so far the duo has exceeded my expectations.While shopping, I looked at the Rigid and the Bosch. Both are good; however, the Makita matches their performance with much longer battery life. If I had to make the choice all over again, I wouldn't change a thing.Nice going, Makita."
5,A terrific value,"I looked at a number of drills and impact drivers, but this Makita proved to be the best, especially since you're getting two for something close to the price of one. (I've never used the freebie fluorescent lamp, but I suppose it could be useful.) There's a nice heft to the drill, which could be a negative if your hands are small. But for price/value, this model blew everything else out of the water, and I haven't been disappointed by its performance."
5,Bigstork,"This combo is great. I have used many cordless drill, and this is as good as any others I have owned or used. The impact driver is all that it is advertised to be. Quite a pleasure to drive the screws without stipping the heads. I would definitely recommend it."
4,very pleased,"I received the makita combo about 3 weeks ago and have been using the threealot.I'm very pleased on the operation of the tools. The only draw-back I can think of is that when purcasing a socket adapter for the impact driver,the adapter has a tendancy to twist.So I suggest buy a quality one from a tool salesman or a commercial tool store.Even bought one from sears and it twisted.The batteries last a long time.the light is nice and bright. The drill and impact driver have plenty of power.I'm glad I purchased them."
1,My toddler didn't really seem to understand the book,My 4-year-old child didn't seem to enjoy this book very much because she didn't really understand what they were trying to say because the author makes teletubbies talk like babies. It would be more educational to make them speak PROPER ENGLISH!!
2,"Basic, Easy to strip off too much",Picked this up and was disappointed with it. Squeeze to fast and it accidently clips the wires. It's pretty flimsy and doesn't feel well built. Used another stripper to set up my home theater system.
3,A wonderful series for both children and those who are young at heart,"The reason I gave it only three stars is because of the pricing per episode which I consider to be too much. After all, one can get the DVD of the entire series (Seasons 1-3) for just a bit more than the cost to download all of Season One.""The Littles"" centers around 10 inches tall siblings Tom and Lucy, cousin Dinky, Grandpa Little and parents, Frank and Helen. Their human friend is 12-year-old Henry Bigg and his pet turtle, Slick. There's also a villain in the form of Dr. Hunter. For the most part, the show is well-written, with positive messages in each episode.Here's a breakdown of the episodes:Season OneBeware of Hunter!Lost City of the LittlesThe Big ScareLights, Camera, Littles!The Spirits of the NightThe Little WinnerA Big Cure for a Little IllnessThe Rats Are Coming, The Rats Are ComingThe Little Fairy TalePrescription for DisasterThe Little ScoutsA Little Gold, A Lot of TroubleDinky's Doomsday Pizza"
3,Important but disappointing,"Mundy brings to light many important and disturbing facts about the scientific and regulatory proceses involved in drug approval, and how they can be influenced by the pharmaceutical companies. She has also written an exciting courtroom drama.I was disappointed, however, that she never gave us a systematic account of the evidence about whether the diet drugs caused pulmonary hypertension or valvular disease -- her story would have been more compelling if she had. Nor did I feel that her stories about the plaintiff and defense lawyers were balanced. I shared her dismay at the tactics of the defense, but she did not seem concerned when the plaintiff attorneys abused procedure or stretched the truth."
3,"an important story, but a disappointing book","I don't really understand the gushing enthusiasm of many of the previous reviewers. There are a lot of great books out there about corporations doing evil things to innocent people (A Civil Action, Civil Warriors, Bending the Law, Outrageous Misconduct, Agent Orange on Trial, Cornered), but Dispensing With the Truth simply is not among them.Mundy's fundamental error is her lack of confidence in the power of her story. Instead of letting the facts speak for themselves, she paints a heavyhanded, simplistic morality tale.There is a fascinating and important story to be told here, but ultimately this book lacks the credibility to tell it effectively."
1,"No matter how thin you slice it, there are always two sides","Tens of thousands of claimants have hit the jackpot with Phen-fen. Fraudulant claims are rampant and people like this claim moral high ground. Disgusting. Without tort reform, the drug industry will go down in flames. Who in their right mind would develop a drug for the severely obese now, as a group they are a high risk group anyway, possibly higher risk than any other, unhealthy and prone to disease...and their numbers are growing daily. Our legal system has brought access to new medicines to treat obesity to a new low, and subjected us all to their amoral ""justice"" at the expense of American jobs to boot. That is the real story!"
5,One of the finest...,"This movie is so wonderful. I loved it when it originally came out in the early 90's then redisovered it after my own father passed away. This movie should be released to DVD and for all of those who missed it I'm sad for you this movie has all the right punch; comedy, darkness, and drama. If you get the chance watch this movie you will be so glad you did."
5,Coupe de Ville is simply a classic,"I have two older brothers and when this movie came out I nearly launched in my shorts from the laughter. It's really well done, a must see unless your into movies that suck."
5,Editorial Review got it wrong!,"Disregard the editorial review posted by Amazon.com. If you need a reason, simply consider the fact the reviewer says the father in the movie was played by Joseph Bologna (Alda was the father, Bologna had a small part as an uncle). I wonder if the reviewer even watched this one.This is an excellent movie. It isn't about whether you can guess what will happen, it's about the relationship of these three brothers growing in ways their father knew would happen on the journey. Well worth your time."
5,Editorial Reviewer Lynched By Angry Mob!!,"This is an extremely enjoyable film. This story about three brothers on a cross country adventure is both humorous and touching. The outcome may be predictable; but the twists and turns during the journey are not.There are some solid performances from a great cast: Patrick Dempsey as the smart mouthed, bordeline delinquent younger brother, Daniel Stern as the controling, borderline psychotic older brother and Alan Arkin as the gruff but completely lovable father.This is definitely a feel good movie, a quality member of a genre that is far too under-sold and under-rated by criticsI can't wait for it to come out on DVD to add it to my collection in a higher quality format."
1,great movie but don't buy this dvd version,"Do not buy this item. You will be sorry. I even had them send a second one. Will not play in most dvd players. I fiinally found an old 12"" tv/dvd combo that would play it. I was scammed out of $18. Will likely make me never buy a dvd from Amazon ever again."
3,Good book,Loved this story as a child.....This version is a little hard to read/follow with all the art work and layout.
2,"""Jack's house"" is overly cluttered","I found the art style in this book to be jumbled and actually annoying to read to my granddaughter, age 5. She won't even try to read it herself, although she enjoys the story. Also, I guess I'm showing my age but I thought ""the rat ate the malt"", not cheese."
5,Got rid of Thrips in two applications,"I used this to get rid of Thrips in my indoor garden, first application seemed to have eradicated them, and followed up with a second application a few days later just to insure I got them all. Haven't found any Thrips for over three months now."
2,Misleading Product Listing,"Well, it seemed to work OK, but I was pretty angry when it arrived. The photo clearly shows that the product is ready to attach to a hose. It you read the description carefully, as I should have done, you will see that it says ""Pint Concentrate."" In other words, you don't get the ready-to-use sprayer in the photo. You get a pint bottle of concentrated product and then have to go to the store to buy a hose-end sprayer and mix the stuff yourself. If I had known that, I would have just gone to the nursury in the first place. This is my first Amazon purchase that was NOT as depicted. Lazy and . . . if I were cynical . . . dishonest."
3,A ho-hum effort ??,"I can honestly say that I tried and tried to love this album. But no matter what I did, it just didn't move me like previous efforts. After a while, everything began to sound the same, and I found myself wanting to turn the entire thing off. I think Sting is wonderful as an artist, however. And, I believe that the packaging is brilliant!Better luck the next go 'round!"
3,UK version has more songs!!!!!,"Besides being a pretty so-so album, filled to the brim with pictures of his face, beware that the UK version has more songs on it, those being a live version of ""Shape Of My Heart"" and the track ""Like A Beautiful Smile."""
1,Feelingless Music,"I respect that Sting is a talented artist however I found Sacred Love disappointing and would not recommend the album.For my tastes, overall too much sound with little substance. I have found Stings past albums to have feeling and this album gives you nothing.I'm sorry Amazon doesn't accept returns on music."
2,Less and less,"After a couple of months of owning this album I have already grown tired of it. The songs just don't stick, not even the supposedly good ones. IT's even less engaging than Brand New Day, and that was a truly bad album. This one seemed better at first, but like other reviewers mentioned, there's too much Kipper and not much of anything else. My advice to Sting would be to quit his ""Sting"" formula which has worn out and either reunite The Police or form some sort of back to the basics band, drums, guitar and piano...and bring back Branford Marsalis..."
3,Some Pleasing Tones,"Whereas I am not a big fan of Sting, I certainly respect his ability to add creative touches to his music. On Sacred Love, Sting gives us many stylish world beats and pleasing keyboard and horn touches. I adore the piano solo on Never Comming Home as well as the percussion touches on the title track. There is also a wonderful spiritual tone to his music throughout the recording.Sometimes, Stings vocals can be a bit grating. Also, the melodies on this record are a bit hit and miss. I am on the fourth or fifth listen and about half of the songs are memorable.Therefore, the impression is a good one but not quite great."
3,ho hum,"It's official, sting has been in a downward slump ever since ten summoners tales (even that paled next to the soul cages). While this album actually has more good tracks than either mercury falling or brand new day, none of them are great. There's nothing here to keep you coming back, just a bunch of good filler material.In some ways this is an improvement over brand new day. That album was quite a conundrum. The worst album of Stings carrer. Except it wasn't because in with the crap it featured a couple of the best songs Sting has ever written.So i don't know. This is one Sting fan who may not be for much longer. But on the other hand, if you've heard a few of the songs and you like them, then this may be your album."
3,Sting - Sacred Love,"Well, what can I say? It's Sting and I get excited everytime he comes out with a new album, and usually love it even more after I see him promote the album in concert. I really don't care for this one (Sacred love), though. It sounds too much like all his old stuff mixed together. Missing that happy Sting sound. Soul Cages and Ten Summoner's tales much better."
1,Way to Go Sting,I first heard Send Your Love on Entertainment Tonight & loved it immediately. I couldn't wait until Sep. 30 to buy it as I know for sure it was going to be another incredible album. Sting did it once again. I've loved Sting since the Police & always have admired his talent & his brilliance & of course that incredible voice of his. I love this album & haven't stopped playing it since I bought it!! I love every song. Looking forward to seeing him sing these songs live whenever he starts touring which I hope won't be to long. I wish him every success with yet another awesome album. Sting you rock!!
5,Best Sting CD So Far,"This CD is absolutely incredible. Every song on this CD is great, and the lyrics are just amazing. It may take some people a couple of listens to really enjoy these songs, but once you do, they really to start to grow on you."
5,There is no other voice like Sting's,"I have been long time fan of the Police and Sting, and Sting just continues to improve with age.Don't miss the duet with Craig David!"
2,What happened?,"This CD is ... nice, it's OK. It's also unsatisfying, shallow, self-absorbed, hip-hoppy. Is this Sting or Madonna? What the hell happened to Sting the musician, Sting the poet, Sting the songwriter? Seems like this album was specifically crafted to appeal to the fan base of Madonna and Brittany and Justin. And maybe to cross over to rap and hip-hop a little bit, huh? Come on Gordon, do you really need money that badly? Folks, do yourself a favor - forget this silly CD and buy some older Sting music."
1,Sacred Sellout,"Sacred Love is a big load of crap. Your first hint that Sting is washed up should have been that he's in Jaguar commercials, and the second hint, with this Sacred Love release, he's now in AOL commercials complete with junior high kids. Man. Much like Jewel, with Sacred Love, Sting abandons any sort of creative or inspirational music for cheesy, overdone dance mixes. Such a shame. Check out what his previous bandmates are doing with Oysterhead, its about a thousand times more interesting and original than this pile of crap."
3,"Well, not his greatest moment...","I would really give it a 3.5, but you know I can't. This is not Sting's greatest album and like many of the reviews, it is very much a companion to his previous release, Brand New Day. Sting is known for his innovating sounds and going against the norm, but in this album it seems like he is trying to please the masses with a re-occuring techno beat in each song. Even the jazzy bass guitar he tries to introduce sounds very much like elevator music. A few songs take him back to the days of The Police, but Sting should be way ahead of his days of the past. Overall it is a pleasant album, but does not have the show-stopping hits like Fields of Gold, Desert Rose, or Englishman in New York. I hope we get a better product for the next album he puts out. Sting is not finished yet, but the re-invention process is a lot of trials and errors."
3,Disappointing,I agree with another review that described this albumn as unremarkable. There isn't one song that stands out as a great song... and I'm not excited to play it over again... Definately lacks the soulful feel of Brand New Day and the fun songs too... the whole albumn is rather dull...
2,Still putting me to sleep...,"Sting has been putting out sleepy jazz for too many years now. I keep waiting for a new album with some EDGE on it.I loved the old Sting when he played with musicians that had FIRE in their blood. For me, it's about as exciting as a postal worker on valium.Dear Sting; wake up out of your coma and find some musicians that you can SLAM with again!"
1,What a disappointment!,"I bought this record because I very much liked two songs on Brand New Day, and, having known Sting's music for many years and thinking of him as someone with a certain amount of musical integrity, I thought there might be a good chance of me finding something to very much like in 2 out of 11 songs. There wasn't. I don't know why a serious musician would want to make a production like this one, much less throw in the ignominious ""Send Your Love"" 'remix' as a bow to today's techno-disco masses. - Next time, before I seriously consider buying a Sting record, I will get a good listen of what's in store for me. This one will only collect dust on my shelf (not being eligible for either refund or re-listen)."
4,Not as bad as they say,"I bought this CD with some trepidation, after hearing all the disses it's been getting, but I do own all of his albums, and I couldn't stop at this point. I was really surprised. No, it's not 'old,' 'classic' Sting. But if that's what you want to listen to he has many albums just like that. I like that he's taking current musical trends and blending them with his style to make his own music. I really enjoy the techno beats he's incorporated into his songs--I think they give them an edge. I don't think it's a commercial album by any means. I always appreciate Sting's exploration in music, and I think that's what this album is. An exploration in current music styles. And a successful one at that."
2,Unfocused,"Overproduced and melodramatic, you will turn it off at song number three, when Sting breaks into gospel (and fails miserably). I couldn't bear listening to it in one sitting, and I have been a Sting fan forever. If you are looking for the sublime lyricism and vocals from Dream Of The Blue Turtles, Ten Summoners Tales, or even Soul Cages, you will be disappointed.The entire album sounds as if it were intended for slick television commercials."
1,"very, very disappointing","I'm a huge fan of Sting's music both with the Police and as a solo artist. Every one of his solo albums has been fantastic in my opinion, even ""Brand New Day"" which many of his other fans didn't like. I bought the CD the morning it was released and have listened to it in its entirety 5 times now, twice during my commute and 3 times through headphones at work. Normally I listen to an album at least 10 times before allowing myself to form an opinion but I'm not sure I can force myself to listen to ""Sacred Love"" a sixth time. I think this album will probably find an audience because it's not necessarily bad work, it's just too ""pop"" and ""dance"" for my taste. It's very different than Sting's usual work."
5,Brilliant return to form,"Easily Sting's best solo album since ""Nothing Like The Sun."" It's lush, melancholy, gorgeous and soulful. Every track is great and a few are instant classics. Contender for CD of the year!"
4,Great CD - But furthers his commercialism,"Sacred Love is another example of Sting ""blending"" his various musical influences. I'm happy with the CD, but I ask what happened to Sting who wrote/composed Soul Cages, Nothing Like the Sun, and Dream of Blue Turtles. I understand that artist grow and start to do new things....but has he gone too ""commercial""? For example....What was he thinking when he wrote Track #8-This War (I Still have to skip over that song when I listen to the CD). You will also find that a few of the songs sound somewhat similar to tracks on his last 3 CD's.That being said....it is still a great CD. Led by such hits as ""Whenever I say your name"" and the title track ""Sacred Love"". It is well worth your time and energy to buy it."
4,Sting's Still Got It,"Like many other reviewers, I put myself in the category of die-hard Sting fans. I also admit that the first time I listened to this album I was frightened. I actually felt that eighty percent of it sounded like a total departure from ""normal"" Sting fare and I had no idea what I'd just spent my money on. But then, after playing it through a few times, I found myself liking it more and more. The stand-outs to me are the title track, ""Send Your Love,"" ""Inside,"" and ""Whenever I Say Your Name."" True, I'm one of the rare birds who liked _Mercury Falling_ even as every critic on earth panned it, but I think _Sacred Love_ is quite good. Not Sting's best but not his worst either. In any case, I am already recommending it to my friends, ardent fans or otherwise."
2,My first sting disappointment,"I so hate to say this, but this is the first Sting album to ever disappoint me. :( Nothing on it grabbed me. He is a very eclectic artist and I've always appreciated his constant experimentation with new sounds and styles. This one, however, left me cold. I found myself skipping unfinished tracks hoping the next one would be the one. Then it ended. I'm certainly not losing faith that the next album will be more appealing... but I'm more than a tad bummed that he finally released an album that I can truly say I mostly dislike."
1,Amazed the average review is so high,I am a huge sting fan as is my wife and we found the album virtually unlistenable. The Don is slipping. No great hits and not a very strong album.
2,Musical sleeping pills,"Coming to a drug store near you - Sting has put out another nothing cd, which is really sad because Branford Marsalis once said he never heard a ""nothing"" song from Sting. Bet he wouldn't say that today. His bands used to kick butt and his songs were innovative and exciting; his last 2 cds have been radio gaga. Maybe he can hook up with Yanni, Kenny G and Manheim Steamroller and put out the world's lamest cd ever! I'm only giving it 2 stars for production quality and musicianship but for creativity forget about it."
2,"Not too bad, but a little disappointment","Listening to this CD is not a torture, yet I feel that it lacks the excellent rythm and thrill of ""Brand new day"" and the peaceful message of his earlier works."
2,Disappointed... to say the least!,"Ok, it's Sting...Great voice, great musician, good arrangements...Flipside? No inspiration, cheesy lyrics, corny melodies...Very very disappointing, starting from the first single released.I saved him the embarassment of the single-star-rating, only because I respect him as a man and as a musician, and in recognition of the work of his musicians (Vinnie, one of the greatest on heart!)I really expected much more from one of my favourite artists.Too bad... I'll have to go listen to his previous albums again."
1,longtime fan disappointed,"I bought my first Police album (Zenyatta Mondatta) as a new release when I was a mere pup and Sting's work, either solo or with the Police, is virtually always in my CD changer. I hoped this CD would grow on me with a few listens but I'm sad to report that it remains to me a shadow of his former work. It gives the impression he has used his good ideas and is now content cashing in with a collection of rehashed ideas from older albums. If you are considering buying this CD, just stick with Nothing Like the Sun, Soul Cages, Ten Summoners Tales, and Brand New Day--each original, well written, and full of variety. This CD is repetitive and dull, words I'm sad to apply to Sting, one of the best songwriters of the last 20 years."
3,Kind of boring,"I didn't enjoy much of this album at all. Most of the songs sounded the same to me, and did not fulfill my hopes. The only songs that I liked were Send Your Love and Inside. His duet with Mary J Blige was boring and went on for a while, and his other songs were just bleh. Not what I was hoping for at all. I still love Sting, but I just wish that it had been a better album. That's all."
3,Don't live in the past,"This is an acceptable album with some fine songs albeit not incredible. There is the sense that Sting is playing in the background and for that, we can be thankful. To those people that grew up listening to Sting this album can be melancholic as some of the songs ""sound"" very Sting; and in that we can take some comfort.For a while unfortunately Sting did make some incredible bland and pretentiou music that polarised many music lovers. In ""Sacred Love"" he comes back to the basics and for that, he has to be complimented."
3,A Tough Call,"This cd isn't for everyone. I'm a Sting junkie...can't get enough of him,but this new effort was a bit disappointing. His voice still thrills me,as do his lyrics. I guess it's the music that let me down. Maybe I should give it more time as other reviewers stated.So far only one song,Whenever I Say Your Name,has captivated me.Others I flat out don't like at all. If you're a fan like me you'll buy it regardless...be warned..it takes some getting used to.While you're at it,buy his book Broken Music. This man is a genius!"
2,Dissapointed,"As most Sting fans, I patiently waited for this new album with high hopes and expectations. Unmoved by ""All this Time"", I hoped Sacred Love would be an album of more inspired new material. Sadly, I am thoroughly dissapointed with this effort. While there are clearly traces of Sting's greatness (the voice, the storytelling); they are largely overshadowed by unecessary sonic experimentation. Sting seems torn between creating songs that are very similar to his past solo works and modernizing his sound to include every possible technology and musical style. The result, in my opinion, is a very confused and awkward album. I know that it is unreasonable to expect another ""Soul Cages"", but I do hope Sting's next effort will follow in the path laid by his other great albums rather than falter again in an attempt to be ""innovative""."
1,Over the edge,"I've been a fan of Sting's music for a number of years. I know he has a politcal agenda. He's written many songsthat skillfully and, sometimes,convincingly,that support hisagenda. But, Sacred Love Songs is his worst effort ever. The song, ""This War""is a shrill and erroneous indictment of Bush hispursuit of the war on terrior.Childish anger is the only term I can use to describe this song. The other songs on this CD are average at best. Certainly, in my opinion, thisis his WORST effort ever. I'm still a fan. I just hope his nexteffort is much better and more mature than this stuff!"
3,Sounds unmotivated,"He's anything but prolific--he releases an album every three or four years with only ten new songs. So why can't Sting make all ten count? The single, ""Send Your Love,"" is a decent song, and his duet with Mary J. Blige on ""Whenever I Say Your Name"" is a stirring listening experience. It's telling, though, that Blige is the one whose voice stands out and makes the song interesting--she's the one bringing the fireworks. The remaining collection of Sting solos isn't bad, but it's bland enough that most of it will drop from memory as soon as you put this CD back on the shelf to gather dust next to Brand New Day."
2,I wish I had liked it.... but didn't,"Sting is my favourite artist. I always have great expectations whenever a new project is announced. And I had them with ""Sacred Love"" as well. To me, some ""BNDay"" songs were his best stuff since ""Ten Summoners Tale"".I expected SLove to be a new step forwards after 4 years of silence. After listening more than 10 times to this record I am VERY SAD to admit that this is not a great work. I listened to it with intent to test whether my first perception was wrong and if I discovered any secret in the development of the tunes within myself.Songs are well produced but DON'T WORK in the end. The only tune I love and want to listen again and again is ""The Book of My life"". The rest of the songs are nice but they don't sound any original. What a pity!!"
5,Sting made another pop masterpiece!,"definitively it is his best album since ""Ten summoner tales"" - all songs are catchy, but full of emotions.just listen to Sting roaring out his need to be loved in opener ""Inside"".""Dead man's rope"",""Stolen car"" and phenomenal electronic driven ""Never coming home"" are highlights here.no weak song.Even the duet with Mary J Blige which could have turn into another pseudo-hip hop thing is charming and romantic.get ""Sacred love"" - and do not listen to the critics!"
3,Nothing New - Sting is in his confort zone,"I think that Sting is one of the most gifted pop/rock musicians around and that he makes records with the greatest level of craft possible. Sacred Love, at least in the first few listenings, is a flat record. This does not mean that is a bad record it just that I can not yet find any outstanding moment that I can relate to. In a way, the record is consistent with the CD Cover as Sting is picture pale and gray.The songs are well played and well crafted but are similar to any other Sting song from its last couple of records. I am hoping that time and a little more attention will help me appreciate the songs better.In summary, if you are a Sting fan you will appreciate new music but may be a little dissapointed that he did not bring something new to the table."
4,Still Growing On Me,"Ok, I'll admit, I bought this album merely based upon my past interest and ownership of most everything Sting has released on cd. I've heard ""Send Your Love"" numerous times and though it didn't connect with me the same way that ""Desert Rose"" or much of his other hits, I bought the cd with hopes that the rest of the offerings would give me something new from this talented artist, a new styling, a new effort, different from past releases. And indeed it does. There are different sounds on this cd, very different from things he's done before, but that's the beauty of Sting and his music, he's always trying something new, something on the edge, something different, much like Peter Gabriel. I'd be disappointed if it had sounded like everything else he's ever put out.I'm still playing and listening, and I am certain a few tracks will become favorites, right up there with Fragile, 1000 Years to name a few. Give it a chance, it's an interesting effort!"
2,Headed in the wrong direction,"What was he thinking? Sting is one of the most flexible artists in Pop, but this is not where he needs to be. It's artificial. In fact, even many of the instruments are artificial as well (sampled drums, etc). Hopefully he will give us one more before he retires and it will provide us with the listening joy we're accustomed to. Don't waste your time on this one."
3,A Bit Disappointed,"Many of the songs on this beautifully produced and arranged CD have rather lackluster melodies, a fact that becomes quite obvious on repeated listenings. While generally intriguing lyrically, Sting at times falls back upon ideas that he's explored to better effect in the past. In fact one hears echoes of BRING ON THE NIGHT (guitar in NEVER COMING HOME), WALKING IN YOUR FOOTSTEPS (quoted in DEAD MAN'S ROPE), and Jason Robello seems to channel the spirit Of Kenny Kirkland's wonderful piano solo from the live Sting CD BRING ON THE NIGHT, specifically the one from WHEN THE WORLD IS RUNNING YOU DOWN. Usually one can find two or three classic Sting tunes per album, but that's simply not the case here. For me, the stand-outs are SEND YOUR LOVE and THE BOOK OF MY LIFE. Could we get him to work on these songs for another few months and then re-release it?"
3,"Not Bad, but...","I've only had about a day of listening to this CD, but my first impression is that I am somewhat dissapointed with this album. It comes across as kind of bland to me. There's not a lot of songs that have a lot of hook or catchiness to them. Sting has always been known for his insightful and introspective lyrics and his style has certainely changed from his Police years. This release has a very somber feel to it, a lot of minor chord progressions and funky R&B/ jazz riffs, but I was really wanting to hear a few more upbeat songs (like Brand New Day, If I Ever Lose My Faith In You) and only at the end with the title track, do we get something along those lines. Don't get wrong. I have always been a big Sting fan, but this release has left me a little dissapointed and wanting more...I'm sure it will grow on me but my first impression gives this release about 2 1/2 stars..."
3,Dissapointed...,"Bad production has never been a problem with Sting's music. It's always been impeccable in the details, and 'Sacred Love' is no exception. But Sting's 2003 album was a major dissapointment in terms of its lack of originality, something that we'd not seen in his work before. He piggybacked on the success of his acclaimed 'Brand New Day' by furthering his musical exploration into the realms of World Music, but the album lacks the same spirit and organic sense that its predecessor posessed.Considering how much I admire his work and his proven ability to recreate himself in creative ways, and the fact that I have every album Sting's recorded in his solo career as well as all his music from his time with The Police as well, I guess this is a big first time for me. I am dissapointed at it: I pass."
2,Bad reaction to this Sting!!,"Sting has given us some of the most melodic and prolific songwriting of our time, which ""Sacred Love"" does not offer. I have to say that I was really let down this time. The production is quite current and immaculate, but the essence of good profound songcraft is not here.If you look back at Sting's entire career, you will find a man going against the grain of radio and still maintaining to rack up a multi-platinum record. This new effort seems very bland in it's heart of hearts - and I just hope that Sting hasn't lost that wonderful vision that brought us to him years ago. Go back and buy ""Bring On The Night"" or ""...Nothing Like The Sun"" - these titles will offer a lifetime of listening enjoyment, without the prospect of getting laboured or out-of-style when the next hip-hop/rock phase is born.All in all, Sting does maintain to keep it fresh this time out, but after all is said and done, we know what the man is truly capable of creating."
1,Sting needs to retire,"I've never been a fan of Sting's. His voice is very weird and can be obnoxious after a while. I really can't stand his song ""Roxanne."" Instead of singing, he wails. I don't know, I just don't care for his style. He's trying to sound more mainstream by doing dance stuff, like his first single ""Send Your Love."" This guy is already in his mid-50s... doing dance music is not what he should do. Plus, only 10 songs? What a rip! Sting has lost his stinger. Gloria Estefan's ""Unwrapped,"" Dido's ""Life for Rent,"" or Seal's ""Seal IV"" is something to go with instead."
2,Go Bananas instead!,"I just bought Stings' latest album Sacred Love, along with Deep Purple's latest album, Bananas and couldn't have had a more one sided listening experience.Two of my favorite artists seem to be going in different directions and I'm not talking musical. I can't believe how dull Sacred Love is, the music lacks spark and the songs simply aren't that good or memorable. The arrangements are typical been there done that and Sting just doesn't sound like he's having fun! When the disc ended I knew I wouldn't be in a hurry to play it again any time soon.On the contrary, Deep Purple's new album is everything Stings' isn't. Great songs, unbelievable performances and the band sound like they are having FUN! Plus, the running order of the album is just outstanding. I've played Bananas10 times as much as Sacred Love. It's safe to say this is not Sting's finest hour, but it might be Deep Purple's.Two stars: Sacred LoveFive stars: Bananas"
1,Nirvana fans please boycott...,"When Kurt Cobain committed suicide, Sting publicly said that he was glad that Kurt was dead.Don't buy an album from this jerk."
2,UGH!,"I have been a Sting fan since the Police days. His recordings usually took time to grow on me and then became favorites. Sadly, this one never will. No, I am not comparing him to his previous work. I appreciate his efforts to vary his style. The fact is, that it sounds like he just mailed this one in. The techno-pop is also a big turn-off. Sorry Sting, I know you will do better next time."
1,Sacred Love - not sacred and I don't love it,"This CD fell far far below my high expectations of Sting. I found it unimaginative, sounding much like many of his earlier pieces."
1,Totally irritating on every level,"I was just forced to listen to this whole album while sitting at Barnes and Noble and it was the worst, most obnoxious, self-indulgent, self-important piece of irritating drivel that I have ever heard. Each song was more horrendous and shrill than the one that preceded it. This guy is so full of himself that it would be funny if it weren't so grating. You can't even hear the music itself because he never stops singing for even a couple of seconds. The ego astounds, as big as the sound is bad. I wish I could give zero stars."
1,Set the Snooze Alarm,"I'd love to write a review of Sacred Love, but I keep nodding off while I play it. Wasn't sure the somnambulence factor could exceed Mercury Falling, but sure enough, we have a winner.Note to Sting: Listen to Bring on the Night about five times before sitting down to do your next work.Gotta go....feeling....sleeeeeepy."
2,Sting's worst to date,Anyone who has anything laudatory to say about this album is absolutely miguided--this is w/o question Sting's worst album to date.Save your money; hopefully Sting will be able to regroup and next time put together an album worthy of his body of work prior to this piece of droll.
1,What Kind Of Music Is This???,"One word...Ewwwwwww.Go check out ""Speakerboxxx/The Love Below"" by OutKast.But seriously, save your money!!"
1,ghetto-crap,"Sadly, this truly gifted artist wastes his talents on the moronic cadences of hip-hop and ""world-music."" I re-sold the CD at a garage sale for 75 cents."
5,BUY THE IMPORT CD!!!!,"I bought this cd for xmas and i wasn't so sure about it:the second time i listened it i falled in love for all this great album.You can listen all the songs many and many times without boring because they are made to relax you and to make you to dream.Over all i want to spend some words for the song ""STOLEN CAR"" that this version of the cd miss:this is the best song of the cd,the lyrics are very poetic and the music is a great mix of classical Sting sound and latin hot music;so if you decide to buy Sacred love chose the import version.This is why i chose to make my review here:i know that the import cd is more expensive than this one but you cannot miss this song.Thank you all for have read my review!"
3,Sting is getting old,"A couple of nights ago I saw Sting performing Let your soul be our Pilot on a Saturday Night Live re-run from 1996. He and the band sounded incredible, and despite Mercury Falling being somewhat disappointing at the time, it sounds marvelous now compared to his more recent work.Sacred Love has some enjoyable moments but does not really hold up as an album, many tracks need to skipped. Sting was pure genius from his police days up to When We Dance (late 1994), but he is getting old and perhaps should consider changing his formula. It worked when he was young but it doesn't anymore."
3,"Good, not Great...","I have loved Sting's music since The Police hit the scene in 1978. I own every solo album, & just finished listening to his latest. I can't believe it is his first album since 1999...? Anyway, it has much of the classic Sting sound throughout, but it lacks the depth of some of his earlier work. It will be difficult to top ""Ten Summoner's Tales"", which is my all time favorite solo album from him. If ""Ten Summoner's Tales"" is a 5 Star album in my book, ""Brand New Day"" a 4 Star...Then, ""Sacred Love"" is a 3 Star.If you like Sting, you will enjoy this album. :-)"
3,Average,"Perhaps Sting should have gone for real rootsy World Music this time. Sacred Love doesn't quite work because none of the songs really grabs you and their memory fades as soon as the last notes do. The dreamy sitar on the ballad The Book Of Life is pleasant enough whilst the duet with Mary J. Blige, Whenever I Say Your Name, is friendly radio fodder. Spanish guitar, Arabian infusions and the aforementioned sitar add nice touches here and there but they don't ultimately lift the album above the average. Nor does the pulsating dance number Send Your Love (with Vicente Amigo) or its remix that ends the album. I'm sure that devoted fans will enjoy Sacred Love, but to my ears it's rather bland, lacking passion and adventure. Albums like Brand New Day, Ten Summoner's Tales and The Soul Cages will be a better investment for those who wish to investigate the music of Sting."
5,Call backs,"Sting has learned and grown and this album is no different. It calls back in some ways to the inward-looking, thoughtful days of Soul Cages while the music is less dreary and may remind you of Ten Summoners Tales or Dream of the Blue Turtles, depending on the track. There's even tastes of Synchronicity to be found. With his voice as distinctive as Sinatra's, and his music as complimentary as Gilmour's guitar to the old Floyd, this is worth the two sawski's to get and treasure.By the way ladies and gents, the problem I see with the other reviews is that they are looking for perfection, trying to measure Sting against his past, which is their definition of perfection. The past is the past, let's get on with the future. Good album, old friend."
2,Sting's Worst Album,"This is not the Sting who we knew, he has turned into a Craig David type artist, very sad indeed.Very slick, no real drums sound or the bass sound we knew of Sting.His vocals are still great but the songs are not!Don't buy this one yet....Wait till it hits the bargain bins at K-Mart etc"
2,"STING'S SACRED LOVE, TOO COMMERCIAL","Sting's gotten too busy these daystouring that his latest album isa disappointment. Trying to adaptto this new music called electronic?Just doesn't work.Sting is a craftsman. To craft greatsongs requires isolation, isolationto be original and create masterpieces.Here, it's just filled with exhaustingflat drum loops. No life in those tunes.For real fans, listen to his real work:1/ Soul Cages2/ Nothing Like the Sun3/ Mercury Falling4/ Dream of Blue Turtle5/ At the Movie (some obscure tunesthat never found it's way on his albums)Pure song craftsmanship!"
1,"Lame, not like sting, really...off",This isnt like woohoo at all. Compared to his old stuff. Vocally it is lacking. I just cant recommend this album.
2,Sting needs to be unplugged.,Great Lyrics but... his melodic and musical ideas are drowned out by overproduction. Unplug him and unplug his whole generation--all of them awash in overproduced garbage.
5,Sting has never let me down,"I have to say as well, that this album has some of Sting's best songwriting. I am amazed and awed by each word he has written. This album is very different than his others, but still love it -it was the only CD I played for the first two weeks after I bought it! If you are a true Sting fan, you will very much enjoy this album."
2,the usual Sting Middle of the Road he has dropped,over the past decade.as a Artist He is somebody that I will always respect&dig but I ain't felt a whole album by the cat since 87.He has settled for the Middle of the Road which once in a while is cool but not for a whole Decade&alot of the time albums sounding that way.He still takes himself too serious&has lost that edge&fun element He once had.this is just another one of those Albums by him that He could do in His Sleep.
1,"Awesome game, however, one difficulty...","I love this game, but when I put it in my computer, it would not run. My computer is able to handle this game with performance to spare, and the drive can run DVD-ROMs. This is a huge problem, and it needs to be fixed. I thankfully found my other, long-lost disc of this game that installed perfectly. Like I said, loved the game, but someone didn't check hard enough for bugs.(by the way, this is my parent's account, I don't have one. I do, however, have permission to review products I use.)"
5,Very fun and simple,"This is my second flight sim I have ever played and I love it. Even though I don't even have a joystick yet and it is almost impossible to aim I found that the game is quick to learn, but you could spend months trying to master just a few aircraft. It is simple for a flight simulator once you learn the controls and is very fun from there on in. The only thing that really bugs me is the constant patrols... and patrols... and patrols. I understand this is a simulator, but is there really such a huge need for all those long patrols? A few small things that get to me are one; the auto pilot can not be trusted and has to be watched since it will follow the AI no matter what... Another thing is that is seems that American planes early on are very weak and can't turn in combat without stalling and this makes it nearly impossible to fight a japanese zero. Overall it is a very fun game and once my joystick arrives I can really start playing!"
5,Great,"great great great great great great product product product product product product product product yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes ,,, not enough words i guess"
4,A cute game!,"Tamagotchi for Gameboy is a cute game for younger kids. It's very similar to the keychain-egg toys but have a few additional features. You can adopt up to 3 tamagotchis at a time. Your tamagotchis have to be fed, washed, and played with. You can play sports games to build strength or mind games to raise IQ. You can enter your tamagotchis in three different competitions, one for mind, one for body, and one for cuteness. When your tamagotchis get older, they will ""evolve"" into different shapes. You can even potty-train them!However, the game, like most digital/virtual pets, can get boring. If your tamagotchis' levels are high, you really have nothing to do until it beeps. This game has very few sounds, and since it is for regular gameboy and not gameboy color, the graphics are not very good. I recommend this game to all kids who liked the keychain tamagotchis. For other virtual pet games for gameboy, try Catz and Dogz."
5,-Tamagotchi Rock!,"Tamagotchi are really cool. What it is, is a little alien that comes to earth. You hatch it then take care of it. You feed, clean up after, and play with it; you also have to ""tuck it in"" at night and give it injections(ew) when the poor darling is sick. The originals were very, very cool. They should really begin making them again, however, I believe you can find them at garage sales and stuff if you're fortunate and you can just go out and buy batteries for them so they work. I'm hearing this is an overall good game, but, I would try and find the originals. The originals are just oh so cute 0_-. Well, anyways, if you find an original Tama, go ahead and grab it! The originals are really great. Have fun Tama hunting!"
1,We want hand held cyber pets back,"Ever since I bought my last tamagotchi and I lost it(in 1998), I always wanted another one, but there were no more being sold. I tried to revive my other ones(5 others) and they didn't work I was so so upset. I love cyber pets sooo much.I have been searching in every gadget shop I come across in the U.K. for one for 5 years. I was hoping that the fad would come back around again when the yo-yos came back, but the yo-yos have come back and I still can't find the tamagotchis. Can you please help me find them. Please."
1,no angels - just death,"My daughter was extremely upset when her tomagotchi died after being sick. In the virtual pet and desktop computer versions of this game, a sick or slightly ignored tomagotchi would return to its home planet. In the gameboy version you just find them dead! As a result, I'm sure that my daughter will never play with this game again."
2,Confusing,"This game was confusing. The Tamagotchi creatures kept dying after 10 minutes. It has very depressing music. I'm giving it 3 stars, though, because the price is well suited for it. A couple of the mini games were a little fun, but over all, I think that the game is not worth it."
2,Gets old really quick,"I got this game for Christmas a while back, during the Tamagotchi craze. Even though I liked Tamagotchi's at the time, this game was extremely boring. All you do is leave your Game Boy on and wait for it to get hungry or bored so you can do something. There are only two good things about this game.1) You can have up to three Tamagotchis at once. 2) There are lots of Tamagotchis, so you never know what it will grow up to be."
5,ALOT of GREAT INFORMATION!!,"I had borrowed this book from the library, but when I saw it on Amazon for a reasonable price, I bought it and returned the one to the library. I wanted to be able to refer to it over and over, as I have been recently diagnosed and have several different books that I am reading and like to compare information in them. I knew this would be a good book before I purchased it, because I really liked it when I got it from the library. Anyone with FM or symptoms suggesting they may have it should buy this book. If you do have FM or something like it, you know sitting at the computer for any length of time can be very painful, whereas if you have the book, you can sit in your comfy chair, bed, or wherever is the most comfortable for you. I HIGHLY recommend this book! Just make sure you have a pen or pencil and paper clips to mark pages and paragraphs you will want to refer back to. It's full of valuable information!"
1,False advertising,This book claims that it will inform the reader of some invaluable information that is not readily available elsewhere. The reader then has to edure nearly 400 pages of repeated and basic information which could have been told in a few pages. Nothing is said in this book that can't be read in the health pages of newspapers or by doing a google search on the condition.
2,Dissapointing,"The author presents the reader with an Aladdin's Cave of information. However, with only a cursery attempt at analysing the growing body of evidence as to the aetology and pathophysiology of these illnesses, newcomers to FM/CFS are left to determine that which is credible for themselves. With the gathering mountain of clinical and scientific understanding of FM/CFS now available it is disappointing that a book of this recency hasn't taken a more considered and focused approach. Veterans of FM/CFS will be disappointed; newcomers will struggle to determine the wood from the trees."
2,"Ask your doctor, not Ms. Shomon","While Ms Shomon's book quotes several CFS doctors, she relies mainly on Dr. Jacob Teitelbaum's advice which includes a barrage of vitamins. His book is titled ""From Fatigued to Fantastic"" and he wrote the introduction to Ms. Shomon's. It bothers me that Ms. Shomon presents many alternative therapies that are highly suspect and cost prohibitive for the most of us. However, she speaks from experience having suffered from CFS. It bothers me that she does not mention Kutapressin, an amino acid injection that my doctor and many others in the field use."
2,there are better books out there,"This book seems to be cobbled together from Teitelbaum and various Web sites. It's broad and superficial. Major issues, such as the treatment of hormonal imbalances, are glossed over with a couple of sentences. Worst of all, she describes the relationship between depression and CFIDS and FMS as a ""chicken-egg"" thing--everyone who gets these was already depressed. There's no evidence whatsoever for this assertion, and saying it in a book damages advocacy and holds us back much in the same way as the dreaded moniker CFS."
2,Break quickly!,"I had this for a few days when it broke after several of my friends sat down on the bench seat (and they are small fellows!). Probably one of the flimsiest items I ever purchased; if you buy this one, prepare to laugh yourself silly as you attempt to convince others to sit down and relax on this over-sized piece of thin plastic!"
1,CAUTION in buying this product,Upon arrival I opened the product and within one minute repacked it and requested a return authorization - reason CHEAP and of POOR quality. I would not waste my money on something this cheap. This product could not last and is not worth a fourth of the money asked. Shop some more.
1,bad quality,this was shipped to me missing a part from the manufacturer. the material it is made from is cheap quality. i took this camping and it broke. in total it was in use for about three hours since it was taken out of the box. my friend sat on the bench and it broke with her in it. money down the drain. do not buy. big 5 sporting goods has it for cheaper if you really want it. bad all around.
2,mememe,Table was delivered on time but plastic was chipped when I received it. The 3rd time we used it my 8 year old fell on it and it snapped in half. Made very cheep. You get what you pay for on this one.
2,not what I had expected,"The first one that I received came broken. That should have been my first clue. The cheap plastic it is made from is brittle and easily snaps. This is not a table for full sized adults. My nieces and nephews LOVED it though. It is easy to set up and take down, and the umbrella is adorable. For an extra table for the kids or young adults, it's fine. It does pack together nicely within itself, except there is no place to store the umbrella. I had expected a sturdier table, and I was disappointed."
3,"Cute, lightly written","This was a fast read, good, not great; nice plot development, a fair enough Regency for those who like them light. Jessamyne (Jamie) Calderwood is the repressed and downtrodden heroine being ill-treated by her father & stepmother; she escapes from an arranged marriage by masquerading as a boy...Richard is the hero, he's tall, dark & handsome...feels this odd protective impluse for the ""boy""...you know the rest. He unmasks her disguise; marries her to protect her, rescues her from her evil family/evil former fiance. Some sexual tension & one ""big scene"". It's OK, but not a keeper."
3,Nice regency despite usual cliches,"The excellent writing style made this easy to read and enjoyable. The inclusion of the lady's maid Annie was a nice touch - I like to see servants depicted as real people. My only complaint was the typical ending was marred by a kidnapping, an escape by setting fire to the bedchamber, rappelling down the wall on bedsheets, and the hero improbably coming to the rescue and then having to be rescued by the heroine while all the baddies burned - but no book is perfect."
4,It's OK I guess,This season is good but there are some things that bother me. First I hate when Eric and Donna break up they belong together. I don't care much for Leo he is not that great a character. I miss Midge I wish she was still on the show. The 100th episode Eric's False Alarm is pretty good. I'm glad I still have this season because there are still some good episodes. Good season and great show.
5,The 70's,As a kid growing up the place to hang was at a cousin's basement just like the cast does in That 70's Show. I like seeing the show evolve into the 80's and watching the laughs that come with it.
4,That '70s Show - Season 4,"Ever funny, I totally enjoyed all 4 discs of this set. Big Rhonda is not a character I thought needed to be added, however."
2,One of the disk cannot play in my DVD plays,The show is great. But one of the disk I bought cannot correctly played in my DVD player. It gave a big crash noise. I had to stop it. I am wondering whether Amazon can send me a new copy.Shuang
4,Still a Blast!,"What can I say really?This is a very funny TV show, appealing to all ages- It's the one show (along with Friends) that my father has ever sat and watched with me- and laughed!It's still a blast, I can't wait for the next seasons to follow."
3,This was never a great show...,"the writing is mediocre at best, and the only decent actor is Topher Grace. three stars is even stretching it a bit. not to mention the injustice that this was a hit and Freeaks and Geeks wasn't...- cRAIG"
4,good quality and fast delivery,will be ordering again.what u see in the pic is exactly how it comes to you. plus a good quality product
4,Hot music from Cincinnati,"I have never heard of Greg Nitty before but he seems to be a rare talent from the Cincinnati Rap community. His songs seem to give us a real sense of what happens in real life and takes us on a sublime ride with the vivid music by Nasty Fingas. If you have a original taste about new comers in the rap community, you will enjoy this album (Heat) and its barrier breaking reach between category of Rap enthusiasts."
5,The awesome beauty of small things.,"Expanded revision of the 1984 Guide. I live in New Jersey & this wonderful book is one of the best teachers for my home waters.""Life in Chesapeake Bay"" is organized to take the reader from an overview of bay ecology, across the sand beaches, around the piers & pilings, into the intertidal zone, through shallow waters, marshes & then out toward deeper waters. Illustrations are clear line drawings. The scholarship never leaves the reader gasping for air. There's a highly informative glossary & species list.""Life in Chesapeake Bay"" makes a strong pro-environmental statement by showing us the diversity, poetry & interconnectedness of life (including humans) at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the fragility of this great inter-weaving of water, tide, sand & mud. It teaches us the awesome beauty of small things that exist right in front of out eyes.Bob Rixon"
2,You Get What You Pay for,"This kind of works sometimes. It is random. I put some water in a cup and it said there was no salt. Great. Then I added salt -- lots and lots of it. Used it according to directions, and it still said no salt. Later my son tried it. It worked and it seems to be working since. But I don't trust it.If you are arthritic, don't even try to get the batteries out of the packaging. The plastic was molded around the batteries so tightly it took me a full five frustrating minutes to get them out with scissors and a knife. A simple pull strip under the batteries in the plastic would have saved lost of aggravation.By the way, I am not illiterate - I have a BS in Chemistry and teach computer technology."
2,"""My Family's Stuff""","I figured this was a more appropriate title than ""Gatherings"". So much of this novel is a description of the places and things this family owns. Let me say that the author is a very talented writer, with wonderful ability to evoke images and scenes. But she squanders her talent on this silly idealization of the preppy life. You can practically hear her lock jaw in some passages. Also, the things I am really interested in, mainly the narrator's mother, who goes off the rails to become a damaged hippie, the author barely touches on, while the things I am not interested in, namely the character Pearce (a thorougly unlikable, effeminate character who seems locked in the closet for now), she delves into in tedious, pointless detail. I have high hopes for Marina Rust's future as an author of books, but I think one day she will see how young she was with this effort, in which we know more about the place settings than the characters' motivations."
2,Disappointing Effort,"As a fan of Marina Rust's contributions to Vogue over the past several years, I was disappointed by this novel. It just isn't up to par with the rest of her work. I would think that a compilation of her Vogue articles would be a much better read."
3,Great little container but...,"Great for containing little things and sauces. It stacks really well when not in use but not good at all when covered and you have to place one container on top of the other in the freezer - the reason I bought them. It would be perfect if the round ""button"" of the lid is inverted to fit the bottom of the containers when stacked so that they sit securely instead of toppling over."
2,Bring back the old lids!,"The only reason these get even two stars is because the Rubbermaid and oxo versions are literally six times the price. It doesn't seem that any other quality company makes a half-cup size.I really can't stand the lids. I stick with ziploc for all the other sizes just because of the lids. The interlocking lids prevent the containers from stacking. I've scoured the Internet looking for a set with the ""old"" lids to no avail."
3,Not Stackable,These little buttons in the center prevent you from stacking the containers. Makes it useless if you have a few of them and want to stack them in the fridge.
4,Handy lil jokers!,"We make fresh organic salsa, queso, guacamole, we often give out samples and needed a low cost effective marketing tool and these were great. Love them and so do our customers!!"
5,the rising rock,if you like modern rock u will love this!the song cradle is classic!also lie to me is realy good.how they got dropped by there record label i do not know.anyway there loss!quality
5,Works great and at a great price!,"I have had the hardest time finding a hands free device for my Nokia phone lately. I've been to store after store. Finally, I decided to search on-line, and found this product. I really wish I had looked on-line sooner. This is exactly what I've been looking for. It works perfectly and it's a lot less money than anything I've ever bought in a store."
5,Works perfectly--exactly what I wanted,Basic simple -- Clear sound-- Works perfectly--comfy and easy to put on and take off
1,never worked,"flat out didnt work, i called the company and asked them to send a replacement which they did, but the second one didnt work either. at that point i gave up on it and got one from target for $10 that works just fine."
5,better for my brain,This is my second head set and it's comfortable as earbuds go.I enjoyed my contact with the company and it came quickly and new.
2,Not Very Good,"Not a lot to say here except that it doesn't work very well with my Nokia 1661 phone. This is a much cheaper, shorter, less versatile version of the headset that came with the phone. Seek out something better."
4,great!,"The only thing that went wrong with this is I broke it, got up and it caught on the seat belt and ripped the wiring right out of the soddering. It goes to Nokia phones and I bought mine for like 89 cents here on Amazon so if three dollars is steep for you keep looking."
2,works some times,"Sometimes it works, sometimes it says that it is not compatible with my phone. When it does work; it's hard to hear."
1,wrong phone adapter,This item arrived.The adapter was not as shown in the picture and did NOT fit the Ikea phone as described.I am very dissapointed.
4,Great book for tourists,"This book gave us all the info we needed to plan our trip. The maps inside the cover were very helpful. Book has a lot on where to stay and eat, but only if you have lots of money. For the budget traveler, that info was too much considering how much everything they reviewed cost. Gave lots of info on where to go and what to see. Would recommend to anyone traveling."
1,Disappointment --and kindle issues,"With two five star reviews, I did not expect an almost unreadable book. While the kindle sample was interesting and promising, the remainder quickly devolved to off-hand musings that jump around from place to place, time to time, and topic to topic. I have been to Turkey and I'm preparing to go again, so I hoped for either useful information or a helpful account of the author's travels. But this book is useless either as a travelogue or memoir. It is so highly personal as to resemble mere musings.Kindle readers should be prepared for a great many misspellings and punctuation errors that make for tough going."
4,Links Awakening - Zelda,This game is great! If you whant a good role-playing game this is the game for you.At frist it may be frustrating.This game would be good for ages 7-up.Even the color versoin may be better but you still have FUN!!!!!!
4,Great game but no mention of Ganon...,"This game was a joy to play, and it's VERY replayable. The puzzles and challenge accompany a good story. The graphics and sound are top notch. I don't think the story is as good as the other Zeldas (it doesn't fit in,) but it's a good quest and it will keep you hooked for a couple days."
5,This would be a wonderful game to play no matter how old it is.,"I love all the Zelda games so I am partial to giving perfect scores to this series. This was the first Zelda game I had ever played and I was caught from the first time I turned it on and went down to the shore to get my sword and start my adventure into the world of Zelda. The world is large with lots of fun areas to explore and a fun side quest that has you walking all over the world, but wanting what was at the end. I made lots of notes and ended up making a guide for it. This is a timeless game that will endear you as well."
5,zelda,I think this is one of the greatest zeldas on the gameboy. playing as link to escape the island and go back to hyrule
4,Links Awakening - Zelda,This game is great! If you whant a good role-playing game this is the game for you.At frist it may be frustrating.This game would be good for ages 7-up.Even the color versoin may be better but you still have FUN!
5,"If you buy only 1 study aid for the bible, this should be it","The Dictionary of Biblical Imagery is one of the most masterful works in helping students see beyond what ordinary meanings and text of the bible. This exegetical work will aid students, teachers, and those seeking further light and knowledge to know what some of the obscure passages in the bible are saying. The symbolisms are explained using simple, everyday relationships that will cause you to wonder why you didn't see it so clearly before. As one reviewer above noted, there are hardly any interpolations of men, the editors mostly employ other verses in the Bible to explain itself. The only complaint I have is that once in a while the editors interject doctrines which may not be acceptable across all faiths, but these instances are few and far between. Excellent book; I recommend it to everyone."
5,Helps to bring out the spiritual meaning of the Bible.,"So often we are limited in our inspiration from the Bible because of following only the literal meanings of its stories, passages and admonitions. By understanding the symbolical meanings we can go higher in our inspiration. This book helps to do just that. For example, Ephesians 6:10-17 would be ridiculous if taken literally, but taken spiritually it is powerful and uplifting.Great job IVP. My only complaint is this should have been sold in two volumes with larger type and more words to explore!!!"
5,My dad's book's R the bestest!,"yes the DBI as it is called in the Wilhoit house is the bestest book ever (after the Bible of coarse!). i have been meandering arround his office and old students have come in and told him what a great book this was!!! Buy it!! I come in like a billion languages (Korean, Chinese, and English)~Juliana Wilhoit"
2,"uneven, and not what it claims to be","This CD is actually a compilation of stuff recorded between 1992 and 2001, hardly the ""best of"" for an artist who has been recording since the 1960s. The liner notes are by David Byrne, but it seems from the credits that David Byrne did not actually choose the songs.Overall the CD is torn between a bland ""World Music"" esthetic, and a more pensive bossa-nova sound. There are good songs on this CD, but I'm giving it 2 stars because it so badly disappoints its packaging. There is a song on here that affects ""rap music"" lyrics, and others that are equally impotent, both style-wise and content-wise. One of the really good songs on here is ""Cucurrucucu Paloma"", which some may remember as the central song in the movie ""Talk to Her"" directed by Almodovar."
3,"Nice idea, not worth the high price!","I got these blocks last year at Target on clearance for 30.00, I am so glad I did not pay the high price they are selling for online! My daughter does enjoy them, however within a week the seams on one of the bigger pieces started to rip open. I called the parents company about it and never got a response. I fortunately was able to repair the rip myself, however I don't feel that fot the price they are charging that it should have ripped in the first place. My daughter was 12 months old at the time, so I do not believe she was to big for them. Overall nice idea, quality could be better for the price."
1,did not bring sugar levels down,"Took pills, sugar level still in the 200's, with exercise and eating right. I do not recommend this product, it did not work for me"
4,Diabetes Type II Supplement,I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and it definitely seems to be lowering my glucose numbers by 10 to 20 points.
1,Diabetes help???,"I purchased 2 bottles. Purchase went through smoothly and arrived on time. After finishing 1 bottle, I did not notice any help with my blood sugars. The only thing that changed was that I had constant cramping, gas, and diarrhea. Bowel movements were 6-10 times per day. Needless to say, I will not be using the 2nd bottle I purchased. I do not recommend this product."
5,Cinnamon 6 is a great product.,Cinnamon 6 is a great product. So far it has kept my wife off insulin.
5,Great compilation,"I don't know why people complain about the words in their review because this is entitled ""The WORDS and music"". Yes, there are a lot of soundclips. This isn't solely a music CD or even really a soundtrack but an audio tribute with both soundbites and music.Rob Zombie did a nice job on the compilation. The sound bites are good ones, and the audio quality is good. The picture book of movie posters and stills is great.If you collect horror memoribilia and are a fan of the old horror films, or you used to watch the ""Creature Feature"" type show on the local UHF stations, then you should get this. It's a very nice tribute. If you want to listen to a CD of music, you probably won't enjoy it as much or even understand why this is so cool."
5,Not for people expecting Rob Zombies music,This cd is for horror buffs who appreciate the old universal classic horror from a soundtrack point of view. Good collectible item.
3,"ok, but wait for the new one!","Well, as the first reviewer said, this CD does not live up to the live show that these guys put on. However, unlike the previous reviewer, this CD didn't grow on me. The songs are good, but the mix is just plain criminal- James' bass should be way up front in the mix, but instead it was put waayyyy in back so it's barely audible. I do have good news though- the new CD ""Joy of Suffering"" will be coming out around october, or available now at shows, and it kicks some major ass! James is all over the place slappin' that bass around, and Eric has quite a few of his trademark solos. There is not one song I would skip. So check it out."
1,Entry Level Selling,"If you've never sold anything ever, you'll find this helpful. This really was disappointing, I expected something different because of the title. The lack of flow and randomness of the topics didn't help the cause."
4,Another good rainmaker book!,"I love all of the Rainmaker books by Fox. Easy to read, not boring, bottom line and to the point. This one repeats alot of what is in ""How to be a Rainmaker"", which I found to be better than this book. If you only buy one, but ""How to be a Rainmaker"". You won't need this one if you do."
4,Holistic approach,"Any parent with a schizophrenic child or anyone diagnosed with schizophrenia should read as many articles and books as possible. Look for the non-linear, non-mechanistic, non- mainstream approach. This is one of those books. A. Hoffer is another author to be read. Look for brain allergies, look for vitamin deficiencies (orthomolecular medicine or orthomolecular psychiatry ), heavy metal contamination, look for epilepsy as a cause of schizophrenia-like symptoms, and search for neurofeedback as on of the possible treatments. Do not conform."
2,God and Buddha: A Dialogue,"Deepak is very good. The other guy, Robert, is very boring. Robert is suppose to be the guy who know about buddhism, but Deepak know more thant him about it! If the movie was juste with Deepak I give a 5!"
1,rpm1946,"Not worth the money. The Swing Band was very tight and broke apart after using it twice. The DVD was terrible. What was worst,I sent an email to Hank Haney's website to get a replacement for the broken Swing Band, did not get a response. Sent the item back for refund.Sold the other Hank Haney's items purchased on eBay."
3,Does its job,"This mandolin strap is adequate for its purpose. The chord to attach it to the headstock tried to unravel, so I had to take it a lighter to it. I may replace that part with something else, that stays tied better. It is sorta hard to attach to the tail pin, but that means it's secure and won't be falling off. Multiple choice of holes for that which means an adjustable length. A no-frills functional product that could have been a trifle less expensive for what you get. But I'm not unhappy."
3,Basic strap,It is functional and plain. That is what I expected for what I purchased. The price point was good and the product is worth the money. (Functional)
4,Looks better on web than real life..........,"If you have a mandolin, you gotta have a strap. This is a good example. For the price, its hard to beat.Carl Sharpe"
4,Works just fine,"Been using this strap for a few weeks now. It is comfortable and does everything a strap is supposed to do. Seems durable, but I've only had it a short time so I cannot comment further."
4,Good concert,"Here we finally see the Washington Coliseum concert -- ""Roll Over Beethoven,"" ""From Me To You,"" ""I Wanna Be Your Man,"" ""Till There Was You,"" ""I Saw Her Satanding There,"" ""She Loves You,"" ""I Want To Hold Your Hand"" and incomplete ""Twist and Shout."" I quite enjoyed that concert, you know, the Beatles were raw and fresh in America in 1964, this is also true about the Hollywood Bowl concert, seen next on this tape. It's represented rather poorly, but that's ok for me (I have a bootleg VHS featuring 10 songs from the Hollywood Bowl). Then we see an interview with the Beatles before their final concert at Candlestick Park (which I also happen to have a copy of ""One Last Time."") I'm a die-hard Beatles vieo/film collector, and the highlight of this tape was the Wshington Coliseum concert, of which ten songs are available (the others are ""Please Please Me"" off Beatles Anthology #3, and ""Long Tall Sally"" on the Anthology EPK.)"
4,A SO-SO DOCUMENTARY(SINCE IT'S UNATHORIZED),I FOUND THIS VIDEO IN MY COLLECTION A FEW MONTHS AGO(I'D FORGOTTEN ABOUT IT)AND WATCHED IT. IT WAS O.K. BUT NO THE BEST. SOME OF THE FACTS(WELL 2 OF THE FACTS) WERE WRONG.
4,Get out and see Mass...,"It looks like this guide used to be titled ""Beyond Boston and Cape Cod"" - and that's about right. It's a great guide for the rest of the state, just don't expect to find anything about Boston or the Cape in this book.Once I got beyond that, I found the guide to be as informative and useful - the reason I always look for this series when traveling somewhere new.Here's hoping someone is working on the Boston and Cape version."
3,4 in 1,"This game is okay, but I lose interest very easy. If you like board games, then you'll probably like this. I can only play checkers, so that's why I'm not to thrilled with it."
3,i agree with that guy,i agree with that guy because i do. if you're not a guy i apologize for this review.
4,Music with depth,"so many great songwriters are obviously hiding away... but not this one. This CD has a depth about it.. a real mood. I found myself being absorbed by the music, there is a real variety of songs on here showing the songwriter obviously has a wide creative base. A good buy for sure."
4,Great alternative to carbon,"For a lot less money, you get a Gitzo quality tripod that is nearly as light and is exceptionally flexible. My only reservation: the latches on the legs are stiff and take some effort to release, but if the alternative is floppy legs, I'll choose this."
3,Classic Atari at it's best,"It's not that much for a video game, but for an Atari game it is pretty good. Overall it is very similar to Pong."
5,works perfectly with proper hardware,i used this to replace a broken part and it works great. this product works if you have the right graphics card that supports it.
5,Works Great!,"Does exactly what it should. A real solid piece, it's much higher quality than you normally see in adapters like this."
2,2 stars for prompt delivery; got different DVI adapter,"I would've given this a solid five had this been the more common DVI configuration. It does not work with my work laptop's dock. Had this fitted and worked, it would've been perfect. Not sure if its even worth getting a refund on this."
3,DVI to VGA (M to F),"Fair product. It was delivered promptly. The color of this hardware is different (it is not black, it came as ivory color...not a problem!). Before I get this to work, I visually check for any bent pins and found couple of these, so I used credit card and thin slice of metal to adjust the bent pins of dvi male adapter. Now it works as advertised without problems. They should have done Quality Control and Check!!!! At least, it gets job done! :)"
3,Buy a new HDTV with HDMI,DVI is very difficult to find the right one that fits your TV. Theres about ten different types and hard to find. My TV is a little older and I've never tried to use it in HD before but your much better off buying a new TV and an HDMI cable.
1,DIfferent DVIs !!!,"Being new to me at the time, I bought this adapter without knowledge there were different DVI interfaces. There is DVI-A, D (single and dual), I (single and dual). Effectively there are 5 different DVI pin configurations. This DVI adapter had pins where there were no holes for and no pins where the port had a recepticle for. The description should have at the very least list what DVI adapter is this meant for. I believe what I got was a DVI-I to VGA adapter (Not sure if it was single or dual link)"
4,Great alternative!,"This adapter seems to be working fine. My screen does seem to be flickering a bit but I will see if I can fix that in the monitor's properties. Anyway, I am glad that I bought this!!!"
5,It's an adapter...,"...so, really, what words are required beyond ""it works"" or ""it doesn't work"". This one worked, so buy with confidence!"
5,BEST STONES RECORDING OUT THERE,THIS IS SIMPLY THE BEST STONES RECORDING I'VE HEARD. THE CHOICE OF SONGS IS EXCELLENT AND THE ENERGY AND ATMOSPHERE PUTS YOU RIGHT IN THE FRONT ROW. I NEVER TIRE OF LISTENING TO IT. A MUST FOR STONES FANS.
5,Awesome!,"This is my personal favorite Christmas album. So enjoyable that I would gladly play it all year-round, were it not for the fact that others might think me foolish. A truly wonderful showcase for the incredibly talented Vanessa Williams. A very soulful album, I find it impossible to keep from tapping my feet (at the very least!) while listening to this great collection of timeless tunes. Every Xmas album should be this much fun!!"
4,GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN,I'M LOOKING FOR THE VERSION OF GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN THAT WAS PLAYED ON THE RADIO IT WAS SAID TO BE ON HER STAR BRIGHT CD BUT THAT IS A DIFFERENT VERSION CAN ANYONE HELP ME FIND THE RIGHT VERSION
5,Christmas in a music box!!,"I have always been a fan of Vanessa, a smooth easy on the ear voice. Her Christmas album lived up to my expectations, a modern some what up tempo touch to some good classic Christmas favorites like track #1 Do you hear what I hear and # 3 Hark the Herald Angels Sing. and a Jazzy touch to #9 What Child is this. The title track Star Bright blends the true Christmas message of Christ is with us and shines in and through our own hearts.A beautiful Christmas album through which Vanessa vocalizes her love for Christmas."
5,A MUST HAVE FOR COLLECTORS AND DEALERS ALIKE,"If you are a collector, you know very well that most of the books on antiques are too generic. Very few of them cover specific antique categories. This is one of the best.It's beautifully illustrated, and, at the same time, has tons of valuable unique information that you will not be able to find anywhere else. It has dozens of photographs of various genuine and fake KPM marks, great articles on fakes and other non-KPM plaques, prices, etc.I'm pretty sure that this is the only book available on the subject. At least, I've never seen any others in all of my years of collectiing. Even if it had 10 times less photos and text, it would still be worth buying. Excellent read! Highly recommended!!"
4,MUST READ,Ok i am a student. I read this book and i thought it was great. Thier was 1 problem that is why I didn`t give it 5 stars. the ending was a surprize to me. I think that he should have ethier Made a sequel to the book or he should have made the book longer. But other than that the book was great the suspense was most thrilling. Even though it was not a horror book it was still full of suspence. But I think that if you are looking for a clif hanger book well here is one. BROVO for Adam Rapp. so from a STUDENT IN A HIGH SCHOOL I say this is a must read.
3,Program your CD player to skip the duets,"It's true: nice to have an ONJ Xmas CD, but I couldn't get passed Kenny Loggin's whining on the 3rd track. Ugh: add to this Vince Gill and Clint Black and this CD has just become a drag. I'd love to have an Olivia Christmas CD that was just her."
3,Nice but not the best from her,"Olivia Newton-John is always a great and nice voice to hear so this compilation of christmas songs is OK for me. I would expect something better from her, I mean a special christmas album with new recordings under the directions of a great producer. Not the case, this is just a nice and low profile CD that you can add -without any problem- to your season music collection."
3,I will have a blue Christmas with this album,"Boy oh boy, I was very excited to see this album in the store. I was just thinking a few years ago that ONJ should release a Christmas album. I rushed home with my treasure to find it was lacking ONJ golden touch. The songs that she decided to place on this album, could have been better. She has too many duets, of wich is fine, but I want to hear her only. I am used to hearing a wide range of christmas songs froim each artist. ONJ seem to stay on the heavy more seriouse songs,{I.E. silent night, ave maria, and O holy night] Dont get me wrong I like those songs but I prefer more upbeat songs like Winter Wonderland, Do you hear what I hear??, and Jingle Bells. I hope that she records another Christmas very soon."
2,Nice idea but...,the engineering is flawed. With wind speeds just above a slight breeze the magnetic brims flip up and you find yourself constantly snapping them down. I'm disappointed that Marmot did not perform any real world testing on this product.
4,A Great Re-issue,"I was very happy to find that A&M Records has re-issued the 1993 Aaron Neville's Soulful Christmas as part of it's 20th Century Masters collection. My original copy has become scuffed and scratched from much play over the last ten years, and I had never ripped a copy of it or backed it up..."
2,Whoever Buys This For Their Kid Is Nuts,"Has anyone else noticed the trash in this game? I don't mean the fighting, I mean the TRASH. Has anyone unlocked the videos for each charecter and seen exactly what's IN them? I don't want my review to be reported, so I'm not going to say what's in this game. But let me tell you, it's BAD! My dad was not happy at all with this game! I wasn't even allowed to play it unless an adult was playing with me! Sure, it's a fun fighting game, but it's just too trashy! Look at the cover of Dead Or Alive Volleyball and you'll know what I mean.In this game's place, I would recommend Tekken 4, Virtua Fighter 4, and DragonBall Z: Budokai 2."
5,Awesome fighter,"An awesome fighting game for the original xbox, though it is compatible with the 360. This game has a great fighting experience which lets you pick a fighter of your choice male or female, but seriously who picks the guys? People who play this game only get it for the girls lol This game has good fighting moves and graphics, which make the overall experience better. The only bad part of this game is the xbox D-Pad, which totally sux but is managable, if I can deal with ti im sure you can too. Get this game for cheap cuz it will keep u entertained for a good time, but stay away from the sequel cuz its way too hard lol"
2,Classic Game Bombs,"This game is often too predictable. For example, your opponent always gets a hit when they use submarine radar. In addition, it is not that challenging because after about a week or so, I had reached the maximum level. I consider myself to be not that skillful in general (regarding video games, that is)."
5,The Warhawk Shines,"This video starts off with a quiet upper-state New York farm getting buzzed by a P40! (that is good enough alone!) As this beautiful warbird tears accross the screen, you can't help but notice how brutal the plane really is. Jeff Ethel takes you through a very brief preflight check-off, history and taxi down the runway, but he really delivers with the on-board and chase-plane views. I would love this thing in DVD, but it doesn't seem to be offered. THAT IS ASHAME, because to hear that Allison engine roar is a religious experience!"
5,good,I enjoy the Oak Ridge Boys and there music. It is a blessing from the Lord. They are Christians who are not afraid of what they believe. God Bless you
5,The Oaks Define Christmas,"You get 2 for 1 on this one, a great collection of Christmas songs done only as they can be done with the Oaks power harmony. A must have for the Oaks fan."
5,Great New Characters and Smart Writing!,"""The Nanny Murders"" introduces a terrific new voice. Merry Jones has a real feel for the complexity of her characters. She combines a resilient sense of humor with a mastery of the ambiguity of human relations and the result is a thriller of uncommon intelligence that makes for a very exciting read. I already love the main characters and hope a series will grow out of this book. You'll see--this is the real thing."
2,Starts strong- then devolves.,"Well written for about the first half, this book takes a turn for the worse and loses its style. I felt like the author ran out of time on her editing."
4,A good fast read,"This is a new author for me, This book is her debut novel. It is about missing nannies in a close knit Philadelphia neighborhood. One of the neighbors is possibly a serial killer. The main character, Zoe, an ""art therapist"" gets involved when her (adopted) 5 year old daughter, Molly, makes a disturbing discovery. She soon teams up with a police detective named Nick, who has some mystery himself. The author is a little bit like Mary Higgins Clark. This book has a lot of twists and turns before the surprise ending. I read the book in just a few hours, which would make it perfect for a plane, beach or poolside. I am looking forward to reading more by Merry Jones."
2,disappointing,"Cliched writing, predictable plot, underdeveloped characters, bad editing! At one point Zoe states that both murder suspects are dead...not true! One was dead, the other was missing, although we find out later he's dead. That's just not acceptable. Characters' behaviors and actions were not at all believable. I won't be reading any more in this series."
2,Wow... Very Disappointed...,"This cable is totally NOT Pro Grade. Very cheap construction and feel, do not sit on floor well.If you wanna get true professional cable, buy Belden, Mogami, Canare, Vital, or Neuman. These are true professional grade cables used by broadcasting studio and recording studio all over the world. If I knew these before buying this product...However, they at least do the job, and not too expensive for 12feet audio cable. So I gave two stars on this product. There is even worse.Please, don't be fooled by marketing-hyped boutique product like this."
5,first single from WYIN,"The first single from the breakthrough album Without You I'm Nothing. Despite the success of Nancy Boy, Placebo didn't really break through onto radio playlists worldwide until this release. Pure Morning is a great song and a perfect decision as a first release. Backed by the cheeky french song 'Mars Landing Party' and the typical placebo instrumental 'Leeloo', it set the tone for what the world expected from Placebo, great singles in their own unique style."
1,shipping rate,"I started to buy this item for $2.75, but then I took a look at the $15.00 shipping cost. $15.00 dollars to ship a piece of mesh screen. It must be shipping from moon."
4,First half great on business; second half pontification,"Michael is clearly a hard driving CEO that has built an outstanding business. It is a great story and the building and history of Bloomberg is tremendous reading. The second half gets tiring fast; all entreprenuers have big egos, and his gets in the way as he dishes out advice on everything from education to family. Read the first half, skim the second."
4,Wall Street without all the boring finance,"Although Mike Bloomberg considers himself a remarkable Liar's Poker-esque character his autobigraphy is more Charlie Brown than Gordon Gecko. Egomaniacal though he may be (perhaps a necessity for the level of success he has achieved) his book espouses the merits of perserverance, hard work, and big cajones. The first time I met Mike Bloomberg, a young person at the lunch we were attending asked him what was the best strategy a young person could employ to be successful at his firm. His paraphrased response, ""Get to work earlier than anybody else, stay later than everyone, and get the most good stuff done in between."""
5,MUST READING FOR ANY ASPIRING ENTREPRENEUR,"Shows how hard work and hustle, good ideas and risking your own dough still pays off big time in America. Fifteen years ago on Wall Street he was considered by many a joke. Now look at him. He laughs all the way to the bank."
3,Interesting,"It was interesting to gain a better understanding of how he works. I don't agree with lots of what he says, but one thought stuck. ""If they quit working for me, they work for the ""other guys"". They are not one of us, they are ""one of them"". This has helped me as employees move on."
1,Just an advertisement for the man and the company,"The book started out really good, i learned a lot about Bloomberg i didn't know.About 30% into the book it all turned into a huge advertisement for Bloomberg and his company.This book should be about $3 and could be half the size.Dont wast your time"
3,A Good Book,"This book is a good autobiography of the buisness career of Mike Bloomberg, mayor of New York City. Keep in mind that this book chronicles his business career, not his political one at it was concluded before he became mayor.Nevertheless, it is a good and inspiring story that I think all ambitious businessmen would enjoy and appreciate."
3,Cool but lack objectivity,"Its a good book but once again it proves how difficult it is when a CEO writes about his/her company. Michael Bloomberg provides a good insight on the building of the Bloomberg network but wanders into 'I loved Solomon Brothers and stil do' kind of writing of a nostalgic lover remember a previous love.Never the less this book is an easy read and entertaining, take it on your next airplane ride to an important business function if you want a book that will get you pumping to push hard on the bussiness meeting."
2,bloomberg by pompous @ss,The story of the rise of Bloomberg is very interesting. Bloomberg writing about how great he was got boring by page 2. I suggest judicious skipping.
