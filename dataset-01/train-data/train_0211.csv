4,Uncooperative drawers,Nice construction and finish. Works as advertised. The only problem is that low height drawers will not permit taller knives like a Santoku to fit. I'm not prepared to sacrifice one of my few deeper drawers for my knives yet so this product may be limited in its applications.Otherwise it works as intended... keeping my knives away from my cats and keeping the sharp edges away from blindly groping fingers.
4,Decent Knife Holder,"Though a bit pricy, it does a decent job of organizing/storing knives.Only drawback (very minor) is my 7"" Santoku knife sits up higher than I would prefer. Bottom of blade hits the cross support dowels. However a design change would probably result in the unit being a lot higher than it is. Guess you can't have everything without having custom made drawers...at an exhorbitant price."
4,Does the job,I bought the large and small versions to put in a 25 inch wide drawer for all our knives. Good quality. Good finish. Keeps all knives handy and better than the counter-top knife blocks we were using.
2,spacing wide,"The spacing for the large knifes was wider than for the small knifes so they didn't fit as securely. I have a Hinkle holder which I like better. I got this one since it holds a few more knifes. The picture of this knife holder, on website, didn't show from the top, so the spacing didn't appear unusual. The picture is more from the side."
2,Some additional information you need,"The dimensions for the coffee table are given as 48""x24""x15"". The actual dimensions are 44""x22""x15"" ( I measured it very carefully).The end table dimensions are correctly listed.The weight is given at 150 pounds, yet I was able to lift the entire package a bit off the ground and get it inside in one piece. The price of 5.61 has a shipping cost of 142.00 on top of that, which may be a bit exorbitant as I don't really think it weighs in at 150 pounds, otherwise I would not have been able to lift it.The set is much darker than shown in the picture. Assembly is very easy. Well packed. Appearance is slightly on the cheap looking side, but OK enough. Construction is good, veneer on top of solid oak, and when set up the tables have a solid feel. Each table is light weight and can easily be lifted."
1,3 piece table set,"The tables' pictured appeared to have a parquet top with varying types of wood. In reality they were one solid piece of oak laminate & look cheap. The pictured tables would have gone well with my existing furniture. These don't. I would send them back, but I would have to pay the postage both ways. That would exceed the price of the tables. Plus, the hardware to put them together was out of its package & spread all over in the packaging. Do not buy these tables unless you love cheap hotel furniture. One good thing I can say is that they appear to be easy to assemble."
2,"Great shoes, but these are probably factory defects","I bought a pair that were clearly factory defects. I also got a pair from amazon that were copas with the soft ground studs and those were also defects and I had to return them.If you buy them from here, you will get a good price but it will be a gamble, because the defects may make them unusable.I eventually got a pair elsewhere and they are amazing shoes. They are noticeably ligher than tiempos and have great touch. They also feel very study. My only complaint would be the unnecessarily long laces, but I may have been lacing them not as intended."
1,Horrible foot support,"I purchased the Copa's and upon first wear I was impressed with the outer feel of the boot but my feet responded horribly to the lack of support. I played 3-4 games in them and could barely walk for days after each game. Running around on these feels like running with a flat piece of wood strapped to your foot. They are WAY to narrow as well. The Predators and the F50's are FAR superior to this boot even though I've had both break within 6 months of purchasing; I would easily purchase again over the Copa's. I know these are supposed to be a throw back, something that is tried and true, but for me, the 1970's technology in the foot support is horrendous.I played in them 3-4 times, and then gave them away."
2,for the money...not durable,"These shoes received some great reviews, and at first they lived up to the reviews of others. They are lightweight and the quality of the leather is excellent. The touch on the ball was quite good. If I had posted a review a couple of weeks after buying the Copas, I would have been raving about them.However, after three months of playing in them 3-5 times a week for an hour or two a day, they simply aren't holding up like other, less costly shoes I have owned.The cleats are wearing out quite quickly and one of the inside seems is coming apart.Comparing these shoes to my cheaper Adidas models shows some serious lack in durability.I love the shoes, but I can't afford to replace them as much as they would need."
5,great cleats,"This cleats are great. They are comfortable. Only thing you need to know is that the size is bigger than usual. If you wear a US9 usually, u need only to buy a US8."
3,"Great feel, but narrow sole and durability is an issue","The Copas are classic and are good shoes. The kangaroo leather gives a good touch on the ball.However, I found my pair were too long and too narrow for my wider-than-average foot. If you're over a size D width, you should find a shoes with a broader footplate.Durability of the shoe was a concern. I wore them for a year and half (not full time playing, either) and then they were certifiably worn out. I quickly wore a large hole into the size of the right shoe. Furthermore, the heel became stiff and gave blisters as the shoe aged. They're practically unwearable now.If you have a narrow foot, I recommend. Be careful if you have a wide foot. Also, take good care of the kangaroo leather - keep them clean and lubed up with lotion if you can in order to preserve their lifespan."
5,Copa's are great,My son wears these boots straight out of the box! They are such a comfortable fit that he says they're like putting on your slippers. It's a classic style but it works - why change it. They are slightly larger in size than other Adidas boots but once you get the right size you'll never change.
5,Copa Mundial's again,"These shoes are consistent - great fit, no break-in time, and decent wear. This is the third time I've purchased them and have had no problems."
5,The best!,"My husband plays soccer and he will not buy soccer cleats other than this kind. He tends to wear them out every 2 years and then just rebuys the same kind. As far as soccer cleats go, I think these ones are the best."
3,"ok, but not as good as other comments","I bought this because of the high rate and very good comments from othersthe shoes are OK, but the sole is too flat, the feet are not held tight enough, this might be due to the shape of my feet thoughbtw: the size is really larger by 1, maybe 1 and a half"
5,excelente,"excelente envio, muy satisfecha con el trabajo, el pedido llego antes de la fecha estipulada, gracias, espero continuen trabajando de esa manera para seguir confiando en ustedes"
2,Underwhelmed,"I bought a pair of these because I had a pair since high school that were well-made and have held up for the past 10 years or so. I was disappointed when I received them to see that the quality of the craftsmanship has greatly changed, in addition to the materials being used. The cleats seemed flimsy and light, particularly when I compared them to my old ones. Unfortunately, I sent them back. However, it's worth noting that I recently purchased another pair of Adidas ""Predator"" cleats (for just $50) and they seem to be of much higher quality. They require breaking-in, which the Copa Mundial did not, but it should be worth it if they hold up for awhile."
3,Get ONE size smaller/ NOT great for Turf,"I am sure they are great on real grass with the right size. One thing I noted is that they are bigger than what the guide says. I am a 10.5 regularly but they feel like a 11 or 11.5! In addition to that, I got the worse shin splints and hip pain playing on turf and sun backed grass! Unimaginable pain. However, I will give it the benefit of the doubt and blame it on the playing surface.Conclusion: Get these one size smaller, and use them on firm natural grass fields."
4,Great boots but a little narrow,"These are probably the second best boots I've owned (out of @3 dozen). I generally don't like Adidas boots but I saw a lot of good reviews for the Adidas Copa Mundial.First, yes they are very confortable and fit really nice with ONE exception. I think they are too narrow. Not as narrow as Puma boots, but too narrow for my comfort. I did develop a little blister on each foot but that was becasue I did not give the shoes enough ""break-in"" time which you should always do. (PS I finally broke these in faster by wearing them in luke warm water for 20 minutes and then letting them dry on my feet. worked great)Second, the sole cushioning could be a little better. I don't know if the cushioning on this boot is too hard or if it felt hard because of the narrowness of the boot. Either way, it could be worse.Overall, I really like this boot. It has great feel and fits like a glove."
5,L'assassin on Track,"This is by far the best Rap artist France has to give.Exceptional beats with sample from Amelie Poulain ( 32 mesures de Haine ) and many more.Lyrics are breathtaking..Before him, I thought Booba was the man...not anymore"
2,Not as good as other GloMinerals concealers,"I did not like this particular concealer, as it didn't cover well and was very hard, making it difficult to use on blemishes."
5,Loved The Title!,"Stacey is such an inspiration to young Black women...and an encouragement to me. She is about to blow up ... move over Mayo Angelou - there is a new poet on the scene and her name is Stacey McAdoo!One of my favorite chapters was the mental illness, this was very heart touching and on the real. I felt that she really bared her soul and enlightened the Black community that no it's not limited to the white community...it's right in our family and all of us need to be aware of this illness and take a stand. And stop acting like it doesn't exist because it's real...Stacey is a very talented writer and this book had me in tears."
5,wow! What an awesome God who made the world and all the people's in it.,"God indeed loves all people and in spite of our rejection of Him for aeons of time, He still provided a way for us to be reconciled to him. Even these remote people groups who lived in darkness for generations have within their own traditions a key to the redemption available through Jesus Christ. And Don Richardson is a powerful story teller. He draws the reader in and holds him spell-bound to the very end.Christians Awake! Read and weap over the lethargy of our generation in taking the Gospel message to the uttermost parts of the earth! Rise up and Go!"
1,OLD and IRRELEVANT,"As I live and teach in Ecuador, I bought this video hoping to use it in my cultural anthropology classes. Unfortunately there was very little information about the culture and customs of the indigenous people. It was more of an introduction to some of the cities in Ecuador and Peru and some of the crafts that the indigenous people make. The footage is ancient (from the 60's I think) and amateurish (much was shot by a shaking hand or by holding a camera out a window while riding in a car). Also the information presented was severely outdated and irrelevant. I don't understand how the release date come have been listed as 2006. In my opinion it should be listed as 1966. I feel this video was misrepresented as a documentary and I would be ashamed to show it to a kindergarten class here in Ecuador."
1,Broke in 3 days,"The book stopped playing within 3 days. Changed the batteries, didn't work. I can see why they no longer offer it on Amazon. If you see this book in the store, save your $$"
5,Awesome Latin Jazz,"This one belongs in the Awesome Latin Jazz category without a doubt.This is perhaps one of Poncho's best efforts (and that's a lot to say after so many of his recordings); not a weak track and lots of different rhtyhmic styles here, but all of them around Afro-Cuban = Latin Jazz.His guests here are top of the line:- Poncho Sanchez / Congas, Percussion & Vocals- Tony Banda / Bass- Dianne Reeves / Vocals- David Torres / Piano- Jose ""Papo"" Rodriguez / Bongos- Ramoncito Banda / Timbales & Trap Drums- Francisco Torres / Trombone- Scott Martin / Flute and whole Saxophone Family- Sal Cracchiolo / Trumpet & FlugelhornThe great addition to this magnificent CD is Dianne Reeves on vocals on three cuts (two of them by Clare Fischer), I'd never seen a Jazz Vocalist like Dianne in any other Latin Jazz CDs, and it's an awesome combination.This CD is one of those that make you use your REW button constantly.A true landmark among the thousands of Latin Jazz records."
5,If you like afrocuban jazz this is an excellent album.,"If you like afro-cuban jazz, latin jazz or tropical music this is an excellent albun to keep in your collection. Poncho performance is super."
2,"Salerno Butter Cookies, then not now","I am writing with a hope, not a criticism. The Salerno Butter Cookies I remember were originally made in the Chicago area in Niles, IL in their plant on Caldwell. I am not sure they make them anymore.Recently I did buy a box of them at my local foodstore in Norridge. Nothing like they used to be when I heard this jingle many, MANY years ago:Mommy?--What is it, dear?Mommy, I want a Salerno butter cookie!--I heard you, dear, Salerno cookie coming right up.You can lookie, lookie, lookieBut you'll never find a cookieWith a better butter batter than Salerno.[by Nabisco!]-30-If the manufacturer will kindly look up the old recipe, take out the High Fructose Corn Syrup and start doing it right, this product would shine again.At the present, no hope."
1,Horrible!!,"Just bought a box of ""The Original Salerno Butter Cookies"" from a Walgreens.They are NOT Salerno butter cookies.They were wrong from the get go. The color was too light, they did not have that good buttery aroma..they were wayyy too hard to bite and they were dry and pretty tasteless. They were cheap cookies shaped like Salerno butter cookies. Apparently they are now made by Lance. Same people who make those cheddar cheese cracker/peanut butter sandwiches.Very Very disappointing!"
1,"OMG, terrible",I probably haven't had a Salerno butter cookie for ten years but I grew up eating them. These are not the Salerno butter cookies I remember. Not even close. They're too crunchy and not at all buttery. I thought I was being crazy or just got a bad pack until I read the other reviews. *sigh* I guess nothing lasts forever.
2,Meh.,"I have the fondest memories of Salerno cookies growing up near O'Hare Airport in the 70's and 80's...along with the Maurice Lenell line(my favorite, the pinwheel)and I have to say how very disappointed I was when I bought a box from Jewel the other day. These cookies are not even remotely close to what I remember them being and at first thought maybe it was just my old memories competing, but my husband tried them too and said the same thing! They're smaller, a bit thicker, harder/crunchier and not nearly as buttery and smooth as they used to be. I don't know what the hell happened or why the formula has changed (someone in an earlier review mentioned high fructose corn syrup) but it's really disappointing and a shame that a Chicago classic has been reduced to mediocrity. Praying that whoever does read this actually does something about it...because I sure know I won't ever be buying these again!"
5,FANTASTIC NIGHT GOA TRANCE,This album is hard hitting Psychedelic Goa Trance. It reminds me of the Dragonfly Label releases !!Really great!
5,Well worth the money - helped plan our Irish holiday,"We used the guide on a recent trip to Ireland and found some excellent places to stay and eat.The guide is easy to use, well presented and includes all the contact details we needed (including web/e-mail details).The Vegan Society also provided us with updated information for new entries and changes to existing entries."
1,Not for the U.S. but for U.K. & Southern Ireland!!,"My wife and I purchased this book, and upon receiving, discovered that it only applies to the U.K. and Southern Ireland. While we would like to travel those parts someday, we assumed the book was for the U.S."
3,Not what I thought,"I need a camera with >5MP and short movie feature.This one looks cool since it comes with mpeg4 video and 7 MP. The reviews from Steve and other experts are not too bad. The sample pictures online are really nice to me.So I bought it. I like it very much before I found this problem.THE SOUND VOLUME of the VIDEO is VERY VERY LOW! you can barely hear it if you shoot someone a couple of feet away. How disappointing!I called Samsung to make sure whethter it is a design issue or just this one I got is malfunctioning. The RP was so rude. She told me, ""this is a still camera, no a video camera"", ""it is not a design issue"".I used Sony P-92 before. The volume level of that camera is very good. But this Samsung V700, what a flaw. Otherwise I will like it and keep using it.I ended up sold it on ebay. Please avoid this one if you are inrerested in its mpeg4 video. It is not worth it."
4,Casi perfecta !,"Estoy muy contento con la cámara, el único defecto que le he encontrado es que el volumen al grabar video MPEG4 es exageradamente bajo.... parecen películas mudas y ruidosas. Por lo demás es muy buena."
5,A good SP starter CD,"This CD is great for those who are wondering what SP is all about. The selection of songs is good, but it definately doesn't showcase any of their more challenging work. Unlike other reviewers, I actually love the inclusion of the remixed Worlock and Far Too Frail. If you're new to the band, this is a great start. Older fans will have all of these songs already, but it's still a nice compilation of some of their more accessable songs. Check out the B-Sides compilation or pick up Too Dark Park to see what kind of brilliance SP is truly capable of. Besides, it has ""Killing Game"" which is possibly the greatest song ever written, by ANY band!"
5,Best of the Best,Ok look this CD is great for starting to get into SKinny Puppy It not not only some of the best songs they did but also you can see how the band progressed through the years and sort though and find the time that you can get other CD's from that era I personally like the rabbies album. But this is all around the best CD you can find for a broad spectrum of Skinny Puppy
5,Review for Swatch Watch # SFM102G,"Big Face and mirror look truly enhances and provides a feminie look.. I bought two of these watches one as a gift,and one for myself. Both of us love the watch."
3,What About Dogs?,"A lot of people think dogs don't go to heaven which really worries me. I mean, we only get ten stinking years to live if we're lucky!What if some little boy or girl wants to see their pet in heaven? So sad.Plus, I don't even really know five ""people."" I mean, I figure I'll see my master and then probably some of his buddies since they are over at the house a lot. They seem nice enough, but none have had a very significant impact on my life. I wish my master would get married and have kids, so then I could see them all in heaven."
1,Worst book that I ever read!!!,"This book is so badly written that I almost thought I was reading a parody. The story is corny, maudlin, preachy, predictable, and awkward. The characters are one dimensional, and the story can be a little too sweet at times. Anyone over 8 years old should find this book insulting. It is a fast read but halfway thru the book, I stopped reading it since it was so painful. Don't waste your valuable time reading this mess."
1,It's true - It is written to help people - just not you,"i read this book with an intention to research on my theory - Mitch is out to make money again (why not, it's good money). it's ok - i mean there are people out there who will do more harm to make money, aint it?but using dying (or dead) people to write a ""self-help"" book, to make reader to feel good about themselves? so i supposed if you are a bank robber and a murderer you better read this book becasue you will feel good that you are actually helping people, indirectly. maybe the guy you kill ought to be killed anyway.this book is more than pathetic, it's dangerous. this book just confirmed my belief that the author simply use Morrie for his own benefit. this just makes me sick!"
3,"it was ok...., but","This book was ok (I am glad that I got it from the library), but one incident sticks in my mind and kind of ruins it for me. Eddie wanted to know if he saved the little girl in the park when he died, so why didn't he just look around Ruby's diner to see if she was there, since the diner was a haven for people who had been killed or injured in some way at Ruby Pier."
1,The Five People You Meet in Heaven,"Where did Eddie do his military service? Was it in the Phillipines in World War II. Was it in Viet Nam. I am confused. When he talks to his Captain they are taking about the Phillipines in World War II with Banyan trees. Then when he talks to the girl, it is a hooch in Viet Nam? Was there some time travel involved here?"
2,Don't Believe the Hype,"This book was sickeningly sweet. It was like eating cotton candy and washing it down with a Pepsi. I found myself rolling my eyes a lot. Eddie is a saint: a war hero who risked his life to save someone from a burning building, a loving husband, rescuer of small children, friend of the broken hearted,lover of defenseless kittens...Very ""touchy-feely"" novel."
4,Great Short Story,"I'd like to say that this book is beautifully crafted and stays in sync with a dual story model. While telling the story of the main character in heaven, Mitch also convey's a story of historical points in his charecter always switching, but so gracefully that you simply accept the scene change. Unlike other books where one story could live without the other, both of these forks are a ying to yang of the other, and because of this accentuate the often overlooked small details of out hero's life -- creating a thoroughly believable character."
4,In The Spirit In Which It Was Written,"This is a lovely book if you take it in the spirit in which it was written--religion/philosophy/spirituality lite. What it lacks in literary depth it makes up for in simple, honest, emotional resonance. An easy book to make fun of, and the marketing and hype will turn off NY/LA/SF cognoscenti types, but for everyone without a PhD. a highly enjoyable read. My other pick for an uplifting book is ""I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,"" by Bruce Stockler, a wonderful, wise and witty book about the definition of manhood--juggling career, marriage & kids--that deserves to be more widely recognized."
3,The Five People You Meet in Heaven,"I read this story in one afternoon! I did not learn anythingnew in the belief department, as far as that goes. It was aninteresting story, but not the kind you would read over, andover again, like many of the books I own. It is a one time readonly. Many people were asking me if it was a good book, wellall I could say, was ""It's different!"""
3,Life affirming?,"When I read a book, I like to get the ""warm and fuzzies"" and receive a ""life affirming"" message. I'm also a big fan of ""feel-good"" books and movies, as a genre. This book is almost universally described as ""life affirming"". It makes heaven seem like a wonderful place, since you meet people from your past, and learn heart-warming spiritual lessons from them in ways that you never would have expected. However, there is confusion in a couple of areas that need clarification. How can a ""life affirming"" book be promoting the idea of death (ie, going to heaven)? The author cannot have it both ways here, unless they subscribe to the strange idea that death is in some way life affirming. Also, what's the point of learning important spiritual lessons about life and about yourself when it is, by definition, too late? (ie, you're dead). This could be an OK book, but if the author were to clear up these points of confusion we'd all be better off."
2,Short Story Masquarading as a Book,"I found this book very disappointing. It was simplistic and uninspiring. Certainly not worth buying. If you must read it, borrow it from the library. I can't imagine anyone wanting it to take up space on their home bookshelves to read again later."
2,The five people you meet in heaven,"I am not rating the book just the service. The book was supposed to be new. Pages are not new, a book mark was left in book, front cover full of black fingerprints."
1,Disappointed,"What is the big fuss about this book? I bought it because it had such great reviews, but it was so disappointing. There was nothing great or profound in this book. I kept reading though, thinking that any page/chapter now, something deep and interesting would be revealed, but sadly the book finishing and my only thought was ""what on earth was that about?"". I'm sorry that I wasted my money and my time."
1,The worst book I've ever read,"I read this book because of the high sales it hadAlso as i was reading the back cover of the book it seemed really interesting, so I said ""why not?""I bought it and... boom!The book was bad, and it was getting worst with every pageThe author had a really good theme to talk about, the idea is really really good, but it's written in an awful way.The story of an old man who dies and sees all the people that had an influence on him. It sounds good, but believe me it's a WASTE OF TIME.I read the whole book because I have the habit of ending every book (even if they're like these). It was a big punishment, an agony, It took me a week to complete it.I didn't connect with the story, the book promises a lot and at the end is only a very soft book, that PRETENDS to give you THE spiritual message that will change your life.An advice: If you really, really, really hate a person give this book as a gift."
3,Thought provoking but not wholly satisfying.,"Before I read this book, the people I knew who had read it were firmly in one of two camps: 1) ""Hated it...too schmaltzy."" or 2) ""Loved it...very inspiring and thought-provoking."" Having now finished the book myself, I can clearly understand both positions. I find myself conflicted...occupying the middle ground between the ""love it"" and ""hate it"" camps.Yes, absolutely, it is schmaltzy. I sometimes found myself getting annoyed at how hard Albom was working to make me care about Eddie...to be meaningful...or to play with my emotions. And yet, there were times when I was genuinely touched by the writing or something that was happening. I really loved the ending...and that's as much as I can say I really loved.In the end, it is certainly thought-provoking in regard to his view of heaven. But I found it (at least most of it) too depressing a view of heaven...i.e., if that's what I have to look forward to, why would I want to go?"
2,Footprints in the Sand?,"Sorry, but I was not impressed with this book. At the beginning, I was sure I was going to love it. I like the set up of the old man and his last day on earth counting down. And I liked the old man, too.This is followed (of course) by the old man's death and the experience he has in heaven, which you've probably guessed is meeting five people. Anyway, at this point the book became predictable and somewhat sappy. And the worst part is that I think Albom used the Footprints in the Sand poem as the format for his book. That made it cheap to me -- not that I didn't like the poem -- but that he used someone else's idea to end the book."
5,Welcome to Heaven,"THE FIVE PEOPLE YOUU MEET IN HEAVEN is a novel about one mans experience of life after death. The first chapter of the book may say ""The End"", but it is only the beginning of what is in my opinion one of the best books of the year.The story is about an old man named Eddie who, after an unfortunate event, loses his life. He finds himself lying in heaven face to face with his ""first person."" From this person he learns that there will be four more people, each one telling him small parts of his life. And each one shares a lesson he needs to learn.This book in my opinion was great! It shines a dim light on one of the most age old and controversial questions. What happens when we die? I am not a very religious person, but I found this book to be very touching and almost reassuring to know that maybe life just doesn't end with Earth. I don't think I have ever read a book quite like this."
5,I know my books and this one was great,"Hey you may be thinking Im only a kid but I read the book and saw the movie and this book was awesome.Every page seemed like a new adventure, and told the story to where you could visualize every detail and relate as well .I would recommend this book to anyone adult and child and seniors.Oh and the book and movie are exactly the same read it and see it."
2,Read it if you must,"Read it if you're curious to see what all the hype is about. The time commitment is minimal seeing that the book is quite slim and is easily absorbed at a brisk pace - the average reader should have no problem finishing this one off in 90 minutes or so. As for myself, those 90 minutes could've been better spent in my opinion. For the most part I found the tale trite and extremely derivative, couldn't really understand what all the fuss is about."
3,Not worth all the hype,"This is a story about a guy who dies and meets five people in heaven yet one would easily be mislead into thinking that these are five people who offer some meaningful insight. Instead, each person follows a bland story formula about how they died and why it's ok.I too like many others who read this book, read it because of the glowing reviews and personal recommendations. For someone who never reflects on his/her life, perhaps this could be a meaningful book because it can wake you up. The only other good news is that it's a quick read.Unfortunately, this book does not have a captivating story, interesting characters or any meaningful insight to offer. If you must read this, have the person who recommended it to your loan you their copy or borrow it from the library. Don't encourage the author to put out any more of these types of books by rewarding this piece of work."
3,Understanding One's Life,"In the author's world people are basically good-natured, but are often oblivious to their connections to others and the long-term consequences of their actions (usually good). However, life does have its pitfalls - it's not necessarily fair. This essential nature of life is finally revealed to Eddie, an amusement park maintenance man, when he dies in a freak accident and then meets five individuals in heaven with whom he had some association and learns something about himself and them.Though the book has religious overtones, it can be read more as a simplistic examination of the intricacies of life. Plot and character development barely exist. The book is rather sappy. Fortunately, it's short. The book really does not aspire to be much more than a three star book."
3,It was an interesting story,The book was a quick and easy read and offered a new take on what you will find when you reach heaven.
4,The Five Reasons You'll Love This Book,I. It is a short and easy read.II. It has a great story line.III. It is essential to all those looking for a hope of an after life.IV. It's a feel good book that you can't put down.V. You will be more continent with your life after reading this book.
4,"The Five People You Meet in Heaven: A Novel of Love, Hope, and Ideas of the Afterlife","Mitch Albom's, The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a compelling story that shows how much each person impacts the lives of others. I loved this heartwarming story of unusual connections and Eddie's introduction to heaven. Albom's ideas about the afterlife in this story are believable and give hope to the reader that all things after we die turn out well. The lessons learned in this story give powerful meaning to our everyday lives. Albom's melodic tone flows through the story as he tells the life of Eddie and the five people he meets in heaven. It is a story of everlasting love, hope, and twisting connections that bring a tear to the eye, that generations to come will enjoy and embrace."
2,Not good,I thought this book was very preachy. I don't think it had any fresh ideas. I am glad I took it out of the library rather thanbuy it. This way I only wasted my time rather than my money.
2,This book gives mediocrity a bad name,"Albom's conception of heaven is trite and unoriginal. Other reviewers seem to disagree. Other reviewers also seem to think that ""Chicken Soup for the Soul"" is the word of God. If you like books that are humorous (e.g. Catch-22) or profound (e.g. Siddhartha), then reread one of those because you're not going to find any of that here. On the other hand, if you want something sappy and serious, but upbeat, then you've found your bathroom-reading here.This is a fast read but a short book. You're probably paying about a dollar a word here. Albom pulls out all the college student tricks (e.g. small pages, half-blank pages) just to stretch his pamphlet into 198 pages. Still, in his defense, the book shouldn't be any longer. It already starts to wear thin in parts. 2 stars."
1,Sappy Read,"Remember when everyone became enthralled with Robert James Waller and his sickly sweet reads like Bridges of Madison County and Slow Waltz in Cedar Bend? Five People is on par with those previously trendy reads. Poor writing quality and a painful, aching grasp to be philosophical made this book hard to digest."
4,Heart warming,"This book reminds me of ""Chicken Soup"" series. They are nice gifts for your grandparents and small children. Since it is very short, you will not loose anything by reading it."
3,It's missing something,"The author comes up with an interesting idea and then fails to develop it to its full potential. I read the book from cover to cover in less than three hours and felt less than satisfied when I had finished. It is easy reading, and the story is entertaining, but I couldn't get involved enough in any of the characters to feel the emotions that some of the other readers have mentioned. Perhaps a few more pages to develop the story would have helped. I don't know, but I wasn't shocked or saddened. I felt as if I were reading about a stranger in the newspaper.If you read enough of the customer reviews of this book you will find out who the five people are and get a rough idea of their roles in explaining Eddie's life to him. If you are like me, you will disagree with the author's logic. As recreational reading it was ok. As inspirational reading it was not very deep."
5,Fantastic Is The Only Word That Comes To Mind...,"I thought that Tuesdays With Morrie was the only masterpiec this author had in him. I am so happy that I was wrong. This is the second masterpiece from this author. This book will touch your very soul in a most gentle manner. How fortunate we are to have lived at a time when this person decided to write these two books.Do not waste another minute-time is passing. Now is the time to read this book. It will not take long. It is a little book. Just like a diamond is a ""little stone"". Enough said."
5,I LOVED THIS BOOK,It was such a good book. I love how each of the people he meets all have a significant purpose to his afterlife. It teaches you lessons of life. Like making sacrifices and seeing how your actions affect others' lives. I would reccomend this book to everybody!
5,5 stars for the 5 people you meet in heaven!,This book is a wonderfully writen novel about a mans death and his journey through heaven. Along the way he meets five people who's lives were changed beacause of him. A heartbreaking novel with a wonderfull ending. I give it 5 stars
5,Required reading by humans,"This book starts out a little slow, but it all comes together at the end. This book will help you believe in the fact that we are all one and that there are no chance meetings. I even went to Vegas and all I did was sit in my room reading this book. In my top 5 faves. Definitely worth the time. Sned Dee"
2,Trite popular mushy over hyped,"Seventeen hundred plus people have rated this book for an average of four stars. Not much else to say. I found this book to be overly sentimental, mush with no real lesson to learn about life. An old guy dies; he was disappointed that he had not done more with his life, but he comes to see it was OK after all. It's a wonderful life, Jimmy Stewart, etc. Read it if you must, but there is a lot of better ideas about the value of life."
3,Meh...,"While this book didn't blow my socks off, it wasn't quite as bad as I thought it would be. It just felt a little sappy to me.I guess it was away to take my mind off hurricane Irene as she came into town."
5,A beautiful portrait of life at it's end.,This book presented a wonderfull story of life after death. Beautifuly written it speaks to both your heart and your spirit. I would recomend this to anyone looking for a emotionaly engaging story that brings hope to what seems hopeless.
1,glad i got a discount,"i bought this book because of all the hype that surrounds it.while reading this, i kept on thinking i'll keep reading and maybe it will get better. I kept on reading and then thought, maybe the ending will be great. i finished the book wondering what the heck was all the excitement about? Tuesdays with Morrie was written from the heart. To me this book was written to satisfy the public's thirst for anything written about the ""other side"" and to make money from it. I felt nothing for the characters and the story left me feeling nothing but disappointed."
3,"A worthwhile read, but not an ""instant classic""","Albom gives an interesting and refreshingly original take on heaven, painting a picture of a place in which the human quest for meaning continues on even after we die. The Five People You Meet in Heaven is the story of an average Joe maintenance worker who goes through life mostly unseen, but through a post-death series of encounters with other spirits, shows that peoples' stories are often interconnected in ways we don't notice.The story reads almost like a modern day fable or fairy tale, with a diverse set of characters- everything from a blue-skinned man to a young Vietnamese girl to a drunk and crazy father. There are some subtle, but noticeable parallels between the sprits in this story and the Ghosts of Christmas Past in Dickens' A Christmas Carol. Five People You Meet in Heaven is a worthwhile book with a positive, humbling message and if nothing else, at just under 200 pages, is a pretty quick read."
4,Great read,"This is one hell of a book. I read it three times and still don't understand all of it. I'm going to read it again tonight and tommorow so I'll keep you posted. Some good stuff here, get it while it's hot !!"
4,The 5 people you meet in heaven,"I loved this book and recommend it highy to everyone. It makes one stop and think, something that maybe we all should be doing more of these days. It was very well written and absolutely delightful!"
5,"Quick delivery, good read, a little water damage","The book was delivered quickly but had some water damamge, even though it was listed as new. This book was for my son's school project. He read it quickly and loved it. It was suspenseful the whole time and very intriguing."
3,Thought Provoking,"This was an okay book for me. Granted, it kept me reading, but I just didn't care for it the way I did Tuesday's with Morrie. It was interesting to see who the 5 people were. Eddie is a grizzled war veteran who feels trapped in the same work as his father before him - fixing rides at a seaside amusement park. On his 83rd birthday, Eddie is killed in an accident at the park while trying to save a little girl. He awakens to find that Heaven is a place where your life is explained to you by 5 people who were in your life. It's an interesting premise, but I wasn't as thrilled with this book as I thought I would be. Thought provoking, yes, but it just didn't quite do it for me."
2,What's the big deal?,"After reading Five People I still don't know why all the fuss. It is not a well written book. The story relies far too much on sensational events - a POW camp escape, a failed rescue in a stormy sea, a successful rescue at an amusement park tragedy, blah blah blah. The book is at its best when it doesn't rely on such third grade nonsense, i.e the parts that focus in Eddie and his wife."
2,A good book for people who don't like literature,"I just read, ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven."" Have you read it? If not, you should know it's mistitled, and should be called, ""The Five People Eddie Meets in Heaven."" The only universal elements of this novella are the sappy, sentimental, predictable messages Eddie's five people give him. Eddie is a simple-minded man of meager, crushed ambition, and just to give you a prelude of what you're in for, every significant event in his life just happens to take place on his birthday. Oh, the richness and irony when significant events happen right on a man's birthday! I'm not saying there aren't parts of the book that are moving. But you know what? Oprah is moving too, and her show has more literary value."
2,"Not a bad book, but...","The writing is fine. Good grammar, good sentence construction, and nicely laid out paragraphs. It's not difficult to read, and it's not exactly boring.I guess what I have a problem with is the whole point of the book. It's very ""Christmas Special."" Moreover, it's just been done. A thousand times. There's nothing new here. And there's nothing much to learn from reading this.It might be the kind of gift you give someone you don't know very well."
2,Alright.,"This book was a good read. I found it enjoyable and at times quite sad...The author writes quite well.However, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Sometimes I am confused by the books that are bestsellers when there is so much out there that's so much better. This book is nothing special."
4,Amazing,I went and bought 2 more Mitch Albom books after I read this.It was touching and amazingly well written.
4,The five people you meet in heaven worth 4,"The five people you meet in heaven was a very moving and touching story to read. At first I was just reading the book because it was the shortest one to choose form our selection for our English Class. But as I started to read the story I started to get into it. The only part of the book that I didnt like was at the end of every chapter there was a part about Eddie's birthday. This was interesting but I felt that it didnt belong in the story. I think Mitch Albom took the right direction with this story. The colorful setting and lively characters show how this man's live was. Through the good times and the bad he stayed true to character. I would reccomend this book to a lot of people. If you like a short very interesting story with a great storyline, then this is the book for you."
4,Moving,"The story is very nice, creative, and a little sad- as would be expected considering that the main character is in heaven and you probably already know that he has passed on. I actually expected more out of the book. I just felt like it could have been more substantive. Having read the book after recently loosing my mother, I guess I needed to feel reassured and inspired. But I am not sure that the book accomplished that. Maybe at a different point in my life I would have appreciated it more. Still I thought it was great and definitely worth reading. Good enough to read again."
4,"A Fast, Thought-Provoking Read","Why are we here? What are we here for? These are the questions that this book tries to answer through telling the tale of one man's life, death and journey in the after-life. It's a fast, thought-provoking read that offers a unique spin on the purpose of life. What's unique is the point of view - one of a purpose for every life that doesn't necessarily imply a religious bias. This is a good selection for a vacation or relaxing weekend."
4,poignant,Mitch Albom's book cannot help but to inspire deep thinking. The connectiveness we should feel throughout humanity is lacking in our modern busy world. Albom reminds us through this work how we are connected knowingly and unknowingly. This book was a quick read. I caught myself only perusing the first life and had to reread. The great thing about his work is that it could be enjoyed on a surface level and delved into it slower for more self reflection. I was definitely glad that I picked it from my library.
4,my review,I read this book about 5 months ago...It has given me pause to reflect on the way we enter and leave each others lives and what a profound influence we can have on one another without even realizing it...I know it has affected the way I think and feel about the intangibles of life and that there may be fewer perchance occurrences in our lives than we imagine... I found it an easy and fast read that kept me coming back to reread and rethink its words...very thought provoking. thank you.
4,Couldn't put this down.,This is a relatively short book and a pleasant read. It's kind of a roller coaster plot where you follow a person's walk into heaven. It really explores the character of a person and gives you an interesting look on what heaven could be like.
2,"Stop with this kind of topic, please.","You know how sometimes Hollywood doesn't seem to know when to stop with all the sequels and trilogies, etc.? That's how I feel about this book. After the absolute masterpiece that is ""Tuesdays with Morrie,"" I really feel that Albom attempts to go back to the well but there is very little water. Although it may not be fair to compare a non-fiction book to a fiction book, Albom sets himself up for this by writing about and reflecting on death again. I'm not against the possibility that all of us affect other humans on a daily basis in ways we can't imagine, I just don't really like how Albom portrays this in this book.The book is a quick read and has some good thoughts but nothing compared to the incredible lessons that the real-life Morrie bestowed upon us."
4,Loved this book--very inspirational!,"I am so glad I decided to read this book. I was really feeling torn as to whether I wanted to start a book that was known be slightly controversial, because I have a hard time ""ditching"" a book midway. However, this was a quick-read that proved to be more inspirational than entertaining. It was, however, exciting to attempt to predict who Eddie's ""next person"" in Heaven was. (Not so predictable, it turned out!) I will mention that while I am a Christian woman, you do not need to be a Christian to relate to this book. It simply describes the ""pre-heaven"" state that Eddie goes to directly after his death where he meets 5 different people that explain to him how their lives were connected and explain different aspects of his life that he didn't understand before. It really is interesting and really makes you think. There are more than a few phrases and paragraphs from the book that I think will stay with me forever :)"
3,Simplistic yet valuable,"I had a hard time paging through the first chapter, entitled ""The End""; it read like an episode of Highlights. Mitch Albom maintains this style throughout the book, somewhat similar to the style in Tuesdays with Moorie, and that style deters me as a reader somewhat. I would expect more from a well-spoken drive-time radio commentator.The message in the book is profound, however. I myself did not find it preachy. Albom has a way of working in his principles that, if taken seriously, can offer an altering view on life. While I would not read the book again, I would advise anyone seeking to read it to deal with the low-level storytelling to in exchange reap the benefits of his underlying message."
3,Didn't get any satisfaction from the book 2.5 Stars,"I, like so many, loved Tuesday's With Morrie. I just finished it and rushed to buy this book. I'm sad to say I thought this book was mediocre at best. Mitch Albom's view of heaven was interesting but not the heaven I want to see.Each of the five people met in heaven are supposed to give you a better understanding of why things happened during your life. There is only one, Eddie's captain, that goes into detail. The remaining four have chapters that are too short without great enough detail. I did not feel like any lessons were really taught except perhaps by one of the five people met. Wonderful premise for the book but just not enough elaboration. Also, like Morrie, too short."
4,Great story except for minor detail,I am a husband who is truly in love with my wife. I am also a Soldier and a mechanic so I was able to relate . It was truly a great book except for one minor minor issue: Even the very first cordless drill was not noisy and certainly not anything you had to raise your voice over. I enjoyed reading this book but the mechanic in me had to say something even if nobody else hears me.
3,Got book for a book report,I got this book for a book report for my daughter. The discription said the book was new but it wasn't. It had writing in it.
3,Nice but anticlimatic,"I thought this book was nice but it was not as good as I was expecting. I honestly found it boring at times. I think it had a good message and was worth reading, but didn't measure up to the hype..."
2,A Huge Disappointment,"I loved Tuesdays with Morrie, but was horribly disappointed in Five People You Meet In Heaven. I found the premise interesting and the beginning very well done, but once Eddie got to heaven, I thought the book deteriorated into a bad marriage of It's A Wonderful Life and What Dreams May Come."
4,Good,I really liked this book. Made me think a lot about the afterlife and who might be waiting for me.
2,Not recommended.,Very confusing read. Hard to follow. Not much to learn from this story. Would have liked a better story line. The life story was very insignificant and would not consider this a good spiritual story.
4,"Easy, pleasant read","This is one of those books that at first, you wonder - 'what is all the hype about'? but then find yourself thinking about long after you've finished the book. The book itself is a bit like the main character, simple, easy going.I recommend this book to everyone. It would appeal to young and old, and encourages us to think about how our life really does impact others."
5,True To Form...,"I decided to pick up this book after I watched the TV Movie on ABC. Was very suprised at how the movie followed the book. Loved the movie, loved the book. I recommend this to anyone who wonders about the hereafter. A brillant story woven in with true raw human emotion. Answers the age old question: Can one person make a difference?"
3,Do You Want to Go Deeper into Spiritual Growth,"For a lay person, The Five People You Meet in Heaven represents a great introduction into the world of spirituality, and life after death, and how our lives all have a purpose. When you are ready to go deeper, read the near-death, purpose stories by Betty Eadie (embraced by the light), Tiffany Snow (psychic gifts), or John Edward (crossing over). These highlight the deeper Spiritual things. Indulge yourself! Continue on the path to be a higher intelligence in the universe! The world needs it, doesn't it?"
4,A pleasure,"I found this book to be a pleasure to read. At times it got too sentimental, but I enjoyed the Eddies journey through Heaven and the books process of accepting one's fate.The story is about a older man, who has spent most of his life maintaining the various rides at an amusment pier. This story has touches of Capra's 'It's A Wonderful Life', but with a slight twist.I don't view this book as a life changing event. It is a very enjoyable read that may make a person think a little. Enjoy the story and don't expect to find the meaning of life."
4,Hillarys Review,"The Author starts the book on Eddies birthday. He works at Ruby Peir as the manience guy, fixing roller coasters.All the little kids LOVE Eddie, they always want to ride on rollar coasters with him and Eddie loves them to, but Eddie cant stand teenagers, he thinks they are to mouthy. Eddie is a older man and he used a can to walk. He was in the war, and had only one love in his whole life. Eddie is walking areound the park when he sees a rollar coaster cart hanging off the side of it with people in it. Workers go up to save the people and they all get rescued but the cart falls, and it about to hit a little girl when all of the sudden Eddie pushes her out of the way and it lands on him.~~~I dont wanna tell you the ending and mess it up for you so im gonna stop at the but if you ever want to read a REALLY good book the i would reccomend this to you..~~~"
3,The Five People You Meet In Heaven,"I must say the five people you meet in heaven is one of my favorite books I have ever read. This book starts with a old man and his last hour on earth. He has lived and worked at a amusement park all his life and that is where he dies. This book is very inspirational and teaches you what the meaning of life is. I recommend this book to everyone, and it is really worth reading"
5,The Greatest,One of the absolute finest stories I have ever read and loved. Mitch is my favorite author.
5,"A ""Gotta Read Book""","Someone recommended this book to me and spoke so highly of it that I was a bit skeptical as a critical reader. But the story is so well-told and thought-provoking that I could not put it down.I'd previously been recommended (at last a dozen times) ""Tuesday's With Morrie,"" but thought ""yada yada yada,"" but now, after reading ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven,"" I can't wait to read it, and am off to order it ..."
5,Quick read!!! Want more...,This story typifies what I hope 'Heaven' is like. Discovery awaiting us is an exciting concept. Kudos to Albom for exploring the ordinary person and revealing the extraordinary human. This book renews the spirit!!!
3,"A real ""feel-good"" read.","Eighty-three year-old Eddie finds his life as a soldier, son, husband, and amusement park maintenance worker has had much more value than he allowed himself to believe. We become emotionally involved with this character as we identify with the relationship he shared with the woman he loved, and the father he didn't understand. We watch as he discovers that he has been given a great gift with death, an understanding of his life. Simply written, and packed full of human emotion, this book leaves the reader with a new appreciation of their own life."
5,Hope they make a movie!,"I love this book. It is simple yet very thought provoking. The whole time I was reading the book I kept thinking, Tim Burton needs to make this into a movie. The characters and cinematography would be awesome. Are you listening Tim??"
4,Easy vacation read,"Cute, sweet story. Will stir your emotions and make you think. A great vacation read! If you are looking for a deep spiritual life altering experience in a novel, this isn't it. If you are looking for a journey through the unknown and the surprises you never knew were there...pick this one up!"
2,Not a bit what I expected,"As the story goes back and forth from heaven to earth, you keep on wondering where its going, when it finally gets to the point (all 5 times) its almost like there is no point at all."
3,All the hype does not deliver,"I can't quite figure out why some people enjoyed this book so much. I very much agree with the reviewer who said it would be a perfect made for TV movie. It isn't very thought provoking, at least it shouldn't be for adults. I think this book would be a good choice for middle schoolers, and I don't say that sarcastically. I honestly think 12-15 year olds might really be able to take something away from this book. Personally I think the book is much too simplistic for adults. If what you are looking for is a light hearted story that you can read in a few hours and not so much a thought provoking one that leaves you thinking about it for days, then Five People might be a great choice for you. But I would never recommend the book to a friend. I had planned on reading Tuesdays with Moorie too, but after Five People, I am not going to waste my time."
3,Not sure what the hoopla is about,"I read this book in just a few sittings. I wouldn't call it boring or entertaining. I was disappointed. As an avid reader of non-secular spirituality books, this one just didn't offer much at all. In fact, it was kinda creepy I thought. And, without ruining it, there were few revelations or surprises about most of the people met in heaven.It's a nice read, but The Way of the Peaceful Warrior, Travelling Mercies, Chasing Grace, Barn at the End of the World, etc etc etc are all much better with stronger messages and better ""storytelling"" than this."
2,A Didactic Christian Tale Well Told,"This book was well written, but not necessarily well told. It's not a story but a morality tale, and a christian morality tale at that. I read it for a book club and would not choose to read it otherwise. But if you like self-help parables, you may like this book. It's an interesting concept and is generally well-written; and I can't slight the author, who executes his concept nicely. But it's not really a new concept--that in a christian heaven you'll meet people from your past who will set the record straight for you and allow you to forgive your sins. This is age-old stuff. It's a short, quick read. Unfortunately, that's all it was for me."
5,Quick delivery!,"I have not read the book yet, but I have heard good things about it. I was excited to find this book at such a great price. The delivery was speedy. Thanks."
4,Thoroughly enjoyable !,This was on the reading list for our family book club. I recieved my Kindle for Christmas and was excited to be able to download my 1st bookclub assigned book of the year. It was a great book which I got through quickly because I didn't want to put it down. Loved the main character. I will definitely read other books by Mitch Albom !!
1,An Impossible Read,"I'll admit, I sloggged through the ridiculously sentimental and poorly written ""Tuesdays With Morrie"" just so I could see what the fuss was all about. This book is so poorly written I had to literally force my self to read it. I wonder how it ever got published. If this is what the ""average"" reader finds intellectually stimulating, God help us all. A terribly, terribly wasted read."
2,Disappointed,"After Tuesdays with Morrie, The Five People You Meet In Heaven was very disappointing. I get what he was attempting to impart, that everyone in our lives has some meaning. But I was puzzled, but most always finish a book and did. I then read the reviews and wonder how people raved about the book...not sure it is worth reading again to try and ""get it."" I gave Tuesdays with Morrie to everyone for Christmas...not this book. Sorry, it was too off the wall. I like to enjoy the journey, this was just a puzzle I was hoping had a great finish. Hopefully, Albom's next book will be a more touching...this wasn't for me. No tears here. No movie here either. I've read Tuesdays 3 times and never without a tear."
2,"Dry, Dull and Boring","If it were a bowl of cereal, I would have needed a gallon of milk to get it down. I enjoy reading books but I have found this one in question.I could not understand how editors rated this book as they did. I have read more interesting plots that were well composed to determine this was not one fitting in the category. I have determined that it is not what and how you write that gets your book selling, it is your journalistic credentials and who you know.On a scale from 1-10. I would give this book a four. I am attempting to give the book another chance when I decide to not do chores and errands.I am still attempting to find what others see in the book and why it intrigued them so much. Any supplemental chat boards etc or additional references posted above would be considered."
3,"This no ""Lovely Bones"" !","I was wondering what all the hype was about - weeks on the best seller lists so I picked up a copy. Like ""The Da Vinci Code"" the book is no where near as good as the hype and ratings.A small, thin book not worth the retail price (but Amazon has a nice discount) and it is a quick read.Like or poor man's ""It's a Wonderful Life"", nothing really that new or exiting.Pick it up at the library, or better still borrow from a friend - SOMEONE you know must have purchased a copy, they have sold millions of them."
2,Sez who?,"This book struck me as a lame combination of A Christmas Carol and The Lovely Bones. At one point, Eddie asks, ""How much longer is this going to go on?"" And I felt exactly the same way. Albom asks us to swallow a lot of malarkey in this book. A Blue Man who changes color before Eddie's eyes? People flying around and disappearing in great whooshes of air and color? I did find the chapter about Eddie meeting his abusive father who can't hear or see him interesting, but it was too much like Jimmy Stewart in ""It's A Wonderful Life"". Well, it's a stinky book."
3,Disappointed overall,This was recommended to me - but I was disappointed overall. I think there were so many avenues left unanswered. Too many questions remained about his parents and brother. I found the ending rushed. If he was to meet this particular one as #5 on the way to heaven- there should have been more of a delving into the reason for this to have been the last person on his journey-
3,The Meaning of Life,"I thought this book was a good read. In the beginning it talk about how he was going to die and I didn't stop reading until I found out how. It was also suspensful be cause it didn't tell whether or not he saved the girl, so I kept reading to find out if the first person told him. The second, the third, the fourth, and finally the fith old me. I also kept reading to see what the next persons life had to do with his. This book could be a very good and interesting read depending on what you like in books. If you like fiction books I highly recomend this book."
4,Five People,"An interesting book as it causes one to think about how are lives are inter-related with people we don't know or barely know, who may have great impacts on our lives. Also, let's one imagine the difficulties, unknown to us, in someone's life who is very close to us and how those difficulties shaped their personality and their actions.For the Christian, the book is not theologically correct, but still interesting."
3,Not what I expected,"Few books could follow one as great as Albom's ""Tuesdays with Morrie,"" so it shouldn't be a surprise that this one did not live up to my high expectations.I did enjoy the book, but not nearly as much as ""Tuesdays."" The story seemed a bit far fetched and not nearly as inspirational as the lessons he shared with us while documenting the life and death of his former professor.-- RuthAnn"
2,"If this is Heaven, I'm not going.","I thought I would read this before purchasing Mitch Albom's more recent Time Keeper just to have some exposure to the author's writing. In a way, I'm glad I did. I have not read a more depressing story since Old Yeller, and that was a substantial number of books ago. While I get the comparison's to It's A Wonderful Life and A Christmas Carol (and no, the book does not have anything to do with Christmas), this is a sad story about a sad man who lived a sad life. The fact that the people he meets in Heaven can help explain why, does not make it any less sad. I think I'll skip Time Keeper."
2,Not so great...,"I thought this book was boring. I didn't shed any tears or learn any life lessons. I hope that if I die I won't be greeted by a little blue man from the circus. Never the less, I don't reccomend it- to anyone."
4,Sentimental and Thought Provoking,"I was a little put off by the brevity of this book and give it 4 stars for that reason. However, the sentimentality contained wihin did get to me and made me consider more the impact I may have on others and they have on me. Great book if only for that very reason!"
2,Very Mediocre,"This book first caught my eye while I was browsing Amazon online. Many people on the site talked about how this book was life-altering and that it showed the real meaning of what life is all about. Sadly, the book was very mediocre to me. The moral of the book (I won't ruin it for anyone) was very cliche - something we've all heard a million times. The book didn't have enough sustenance to keep me very entertained and the storyline got tedious after a while.If someone is truly looking for the real purpose of life, I would not recommend this book as an appropriate read. Save your money and get another book that will be more worthy of your money."
1,Disappointed,"With the media hype surrounding this book and its placement on bestseller lists I expected a powerful read. This is not what I got. The book is contrived at best and sappy at its worst. Although the premise itself is genius I found that the story did not live up to its potential. There were moments while reading that I expected the next page to be more engaging but this never happened. Poor Eddie spent his first moments in heaven full of angst and confusion trying to determine why certain people greeted him. The fifth person to greet Eddie was probably a tear jerking event for some readers, but I felt cheated. The ending was lame. I agree with several other reviewers that the best thing about this book was its quick readability. For those that have not read ""Tuesdays with Morrie"", do not let this book be a guide for you. Tuesdays is a great book!"
1,PASS THE CHEESE,"This book was so predictable and cheesy. As a reviewer aptly mentioned above, it was SO written to be a movie of the week.If you are looking for a moving book or a book that makes you think about life, don't pick this one up, you'd be better off reading Chicken Soup for the Heart (kidding), but honestly, don't expect much. I think this book was probably written in a week."
1,so disappointing,"I cannot understand the good critics I have read about this book. I don't like to leave books unfinished, but when I had reached the second person that Eddie meets in heaven, I could not read one more word... I find this book terribly boring, easy and unrefined, bad literature, that doesn't know how to transmit feelings. Moreover it is supposed to be a lesson of morality, but it is such an empty morality. Does not inspire me at all. I definitely do not recommend this book to people who like real, good literature."
2,A waste of time,"The best thing I can say about this book is that it is slightly better than ""Tuesdays With Morrie."" And this leads to an obvious question: If I disliked ""Morrie"" so much, why on earth would I bother reading another book by Albom? The answer is simple: a friend told me this book made sense and contained great truths. But it didn't.The book is disjointed, scattered, self-consciously arty. It is very little more than a series of platitudes and banalities; it reveals secrets that have been known for centuries. There's really no point in going into the plot or characters or atmosphere after that."
2,Not my favorite Albom book,"I have heard so much of Tuesdays with Morrie and went to buy it, but it wasn't in stock. I bought Five People instead and was a little disappointed. It was well written though. I really like Albom's writing style, but by the end of the book I felt sad for Eddie. I felt like he learned his life lessons when his life was over. Maybe that is the point Albom was trying to make...Learn in life; not in death. I don't know."
5,MASTERPIECE TIME,"Beautiful, meaingful, incredible writing style, magnificent attention to detail (some of which had to be preceeded by exhaustive research), and so much more. Your ability to ""hook"" a reader at the very beginning of each chapter & paragraph is marvelous. You made me not ever want to put the book down. I was properly teased so I had to read on; and I was never disappointed. Everything you write is only enhanced by your apparent laborous task of describing either the individual(s), and/or scene. As a non-fiction writer for adults and children, and more importantly, as private tutor to novice writers, yourbook is a marvelous teaching tool that young writers can learn from."
3,Makes You Think...,"Like the Japanese film ""After Life,"" ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"" immediately invokes questions: Who have I affected in the course of my life? Who has been pivotal in mine? Who would I meet if, indeed, there is such a thing as ""heaven?"" And how would heaven look to me? I must admit the book was a little overwrought, maybe a tad manipulative. But darn it, the tears flowed and flowed, nonetheless! And I'm not so sure that's anything to be embarrassed about. Eddie wasn't really such a sympathetic character, but he is certainly ""everyman."" We've all known him. And every man and woman has a story to tell, even if (s)he can't quite find the words. It's a spare, quiet little book that will undoubtedly gain Albom more fans and reinforce those he gained with ""Tuesdays."""
5,Very thought provoking!,"Once you have started, You will not be able to put this one down without finishing it. ""The Five People you meet in Heaven"" really hits home with anyone curious as to the meaning of life, ""why are we here?"", etc...Although we cannot verify that this is what we will face in heaven, it does assure us that everyone counts in this world and that we truly affect others whether we think so or not. The monetary and worldly success is short; the spiritual side is what lasts. I am normally not a fiction reader but I highly recommend this book. It even tugs at your emotions a little."
1,Very Disappointed,"I thought I was purchasing a brand new version of this book. When it arrived the front cover had black smudge marks on it. The back cover had black marker on it as well. Very disappointed, especially as this was to be a Christmas gift."
3,Great book,This was a great book. I enjoyed it and also purchased one as a gift for a friend. I would reccommend it.
5,Beautiful story,"I believe everyone can learn from Albom's book, The Five People You Meet in Heaven. You learn that tomorrow is never promised and you should tell your loved ones how much they mean to you. Without knowing it, we all make some sort of difference in many people's lives."
4,Very sweet story,"Everything you do has a purpose in life, whether you know it or not. Mitch does a great job expressing this in The Five People You Meet in Heaven. It is a fairly quick read though."
3,Nothing new under the sun,"Like many reviewers, I read this book in one sitting. While I found the story sweet and touching, I didn't learn anything ""new"" from the read.My faith teaches that we'll meet our ancestors in heaven. To me, that's a given. The author uses ""real life"" settings in heaven to tell his story. Frankly, I like the streets of gold theory, but what really gives me hope for an everlasting life is the prospect of being surrounded by those who have gone before.I've always assumed that life's greatest questions will be answered after death. If it only takes 5 people to do the job, that's cool.If you've never contemplated the world after this one, this book might be a good first introductory read. For me, it held nothing new."
3,A Predictable Exploration of Human Life,"The title intrigued me; who isn't drawn to the possibilities of our afterlives? In The Five People You Meet in Heaven, we meet Eddie, a pathetic old man who is bitter about is life. He thinks he has accomplished nothing, and feels reminded of it every day. Then he dies on his 83rd birthday during an accident at work, and he is carried off to heaven to meet his five people. Each person has a lesson to teach him, and each one of them was completely predictable. The themes in the book are nothing new, and many a philosopher would walk away uninspired.I also found this a quick read, and was skimming over many of the paragraphs. However, I did like the ending as it summed up all life's lessons from the novel. It was a nice little reminder that we are important to others even if we forgot it from time to time."
3,Mushy but OK,"My mom made me read this book as it is not something I would normally read. The book is about The Five People You Meet In Heaven. It was about a guy named Eddie who was an 84-year-old widower. He worked at an amusement park and made sure the rides were safe. There was a ride that was stuck, so one of the workers went to fix it. Something went wrong and there was a little girl standing on the tracks. Eddie pushed her off the tracks, but he was killed. He met five different people. People he killed, people who saved him from dieing, and other important people. They told him things that happened in their lives that was a part of Eddie's. They told him things so that Eddie could understand things that happened in his life. The book wasn't really about God, but more about things that happened in Eddie's life. I thought the book was OK, a little to mushy but I would recommend it to someone who likes to read."
4,Pretty good.,"This was a simple book with a simple theme. It was a very quick read that most can probably finish in a day. It wasn't the best book I ever read, but I liked the ideas presented in the book nonetheless. It made me think that no matter what we think of our own lives, we really never do know how we have impacted other people's lives and to a certain extent how others have effected our lives. It's a nice thought that once we die, we meet people in heaven who finally teach us how we mattered during our lives. This book is definitely good if you are looking for a good short read that doesn't get too complicated yet presents an endearing story."
4,A Unique Approach,"I loved this book's simplicity, both in format and language. This unique approach to making sense of our lives made me reflect on the many times I've jumped to wrong and hasty conclusions about so many things in my life. The best part was the reminder that there's ALWAYS at least two sides, two perspectives to every story. I must admit to being generally biased against stories that jump back and forth in time, and found Albom's time frames - heaven, birthdays, past events, and real boardwalk time - sometimes confusing."
3,Book form of It's a Wonderful Life,"Albom's ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"" is a quick read that can help one appreciate the subtlety and connectedness of an individual life to many unknown people. The underlying premise is that there is a higher purpose in every event of a person's life.The plot centers around the character of Eddie who struggles with feelings of disappointment because he has never made more of his life then replacing his abusive father as the head of ride maintenance at a small amusement park. Only after his death and encounter with five people in Heaven does he realize the impact of his life and finally ""understand"" it.An easy read that can tug at various emotions and help one keep life in perspective."
4,Interesting Book!,"This is an interesting book that will challenge your theological thinking. It's a great novel, and one that I'll read again to sharpen my thinking."
2,"Not to be compared with ""Tuesdays with Morrie""","Having read ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" I was hoping for another profound and touching read. My high expectations led to disappointment as this book was lacking depth comparatively.A better way to describe ""The Five People you Meet in Heaven"" would be a phantasy novel with a clever use of chronology, and a fable that reminded me somewhat of ""A Christmas Carol"" by Charles Dickens where you meet the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future. Dickens however is able to convey more emotion and more profoundness."
3,"Not as good as ""Morrie""","I bought this book expecting to find a tender and moving story as in Tuesdays with Morrie. It is not as much. Perhaps if you feel depressed, lonely and sense that life has no meaning for you, well, then this book might be for you. Otherwise, its just a nice, little, quick-read book. Don't expect too much from it and you'll enjoy it."
5,"excellent, read it in one day!",I think Mr.Albom is an excellent writer! I thoroughly enjoyed Tuesdays with Morrie along with this book. I've even given this book as a gift and the recipient really enjoyed it. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading inspiring and interesting stories whether they are religious or not.
2,Rather Disappointing,"The editorial reviews made it out like this book had profound meaning and a lesson to be taught. That is a profound misconception. This book basically says that the only reason people survive is because death missed you and killed someone else. What kind of message is that. The ending was a little charming, but that was about it. Also it was way to short. I read the entire book cover to cover in only a few hours. I have to say I was expecting much more."
4,Captivating Read,"I really liked this book. It only took me a few days to read the whole thing. I really liked the structure of it, as the main character, Eddie, meets five people his life has impacted. It's a thought-provoking book--which five people would you expect to meet in heaven?"
5,The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom,"I couldn't put this book down, very thought provoking, and fast reading. Definitely a page turner. Recommend it for all!1"
5,The five people you meet in heaven,"The Five People You Meet In Heaven is a great book. It is by far the best book that I've read. Reading this book inspired me to read more books by Mitch Albom. In The Five People You Meet In Heaven you really start to connect with Eddie and see where he is coming from. Eddie is a confused repairman at a local amusement park who believes that his existence doesnt have an impact on anyone and he doesn't quite understand the meaning of his life. While trying to save a little girl from a falling ride he dies. When he reaches heaven it is nothing like he envisioned it to be. He then meets the first person he meets in heaven and the person tells him a story that happened in Eddie's life and explains to Eddie why things happened the way that they did, and this happens for the next 4 people. I won't ruin the ending but i recommend that everyone read this book, it will touch them in some way."
3,A Review to The Five People You Meet in Heaven,"The book I read was The Five People You Meet In Heaven. It was about a guy named Eddie who was an 84-year-old widower. He worked at an amusement park and made sure the rides were safe. There was a ride that was stuck, so one of the workers went to fix it. Something went wrong and there was a little girl standing on the tracks. Eddie pushed her off the tracks, but he was killed. He met five different people. People he killed, people who saved him from dieing, and other important people. They told him things that happened in their lives that was a part of Eddie's. They told him things so that Eddie could understand things that happened in his life. The book wasn't really about God, but more about things that happened in Eddie's life. I thought the book was OK. I would recommend it to someone who likes to read."
2,"Its er, ok...at best","I read the book over a few days after reading the hype about it.It was a pleasant read - but I found it very hollow. There wasnt much substance to it and, after each person visits Eddie and leaves, you feel like there are more questions than answers.The book didnt do much for me and had no lasting impact..."
3,The Five People You Meet in Heaven - a nice book,"Read this as a book club selection. It was well written and thoughtful, and that's always a big first step for me. I can't honestly say it was a significant read, for me; no startlingly new insights, nor heights of inspiration, for me."
3,Good Story,"This book followed Albom's Tuesdays With Morrie, and is ""only a guess, a wish,"" of his view of heaven. READ CAREFULLY: Albom is not saying this story is what heaven will be like. It is only a story, a way to convey his view that all people are important and affect everyone they meet in some way.As far as the literary content goes, this book is fair. The writing isn't generic, but it won't wow you, either. The story moves along nicely, and Albom is careful not to reveal the characters himself, but rather allow them to tell their stories. I appreciated that aspect.If you are looking for any theological content about heaven in this book, please turn elsewhere. That was not Albom's intention, and there is a lot of New Age rhetoric in this book. But if you keep in mind that this is just a story, then it's a good way to pass time when you're not seeking too much intellectual stimulation. (That's a compliment, I promise)"
4,Five Reasons to Read it,"The Five People you Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom, is deceptively simple on the surface. There is great depth in the underlying message of the novel.I believe after reading it, people will rethink their own lives and ponder the people and events that have impacted them almost unknowingly.There are more than five reasons to read this book, but I have given you a starter list (...)1. It will make you reflect on your own life.2. It will help you to reevaluate who and what is truly important3. It will make you realize how we are all inter- connected on this earth.4. It will make you cry.5. It will make you smile and it will change you in some meaningful way."
5,WOW!!!,"Mitch Albom did an wonderful job with the writing of this book, I would recommend anyone of any age, race or sex to read this.After reading this book it will leave your mind thinking of who you are and what you've done. Its amazing to see how different the same incident can be to two different people.A must read on my list!!!"
3,This Second Book Comes Up Short,"A big fan of Tuesday's with Morrie, I looked forward to his next novel. Unfortunately, I left disappointed. This is another book of a common man who may not have realized his worth to the world. And while I agree with this tenet, I don't think his particular telling of the story was as touching as I had hoped. Please keep in mind, my expectations were extremely high from Tuesdays with Morrie.In fact, it seemed like the esteemed sportswriter had discovered his ""formula"" book to now turn out for the dollars he may not be making in the sports world. Sorry to be such a cynic. I did casually enjoy the book but not nearly as touched as my wife."
1,Save your money,I am not in agreement with the other reviews posted here. I think this book is a dud. Wish I hadn't wasted my money.
2,all fluff,"This book does not have any substance. If you are looking for a light read, you might be satisfied. But if you want any truth, anything real, anything that makes you think, you should look elsewhere. My daughter had to read this book for school - what a waste!"
1,A story you can live without.,"I am fond of imaginative stories and I must say I was intrigued by the coverslip summary of what to expect. The book is an easy and fast read but although it starts out interesting and suprising in terms of who the main character meets in Heaven - it leaves you utterly dissapointed. The characters are stereotyped as in bad TV series, and there are scences that are unconvincing to say the least. What really annoyed me when reading this book was, that one major part of what Eddie found in Heaven was about war - as if everyone should have participated in one so as to have something to find in Heaven that will give meaning to it - as there is no meaning to war. My advice, spend your time with something else - what about inventing a story yourself - I am sure you will come up with something better."
1,You must be kidding,"Author Mitch Albom must have phoned this one in. So disappointing. The concept is excellent and I expected great reflection and life lessons. Instead I got sap, sap and more sap. Read Tuesdays with Morrie and hope for better in Albom's next book."
1,A FAIRY TALE,What a disappointment! I can't believe I fell for the hype on this juvenile offering by Mitch Albom. Nothing in this booklives up to advance praise.
2,More Like One of Those Inspirational E-mails Your Mom Forwards To You,"Five People You Meet In Heaven is a tale of life and death; and about the five people the main character meets in Heaven.The writing is horrible. The format is strange. The writer often has the skill of a high school teenager writing a paper for his English class.I have to give credit to his vivid imagination, but in the end, you don't really care about what you just read. The title is a bit misleading. It's not five people you meet in Heaven, it should have been ""Five People Eddie Meets In Heaven"" since apparently, each person has their own unique five that they meet.Anyway, the tone and the skill of this book is on level with those nice inspirational emails your mom forwards you. Except, those are short, sweet, and to the point, while this book useless and self-indulgent."
1,Not even for 10 People!!!,"I had read a small excerpt of this book somewhere and I made it my mission to find it and read it. I found it in a new Borders store and it was 40% off also.Maybe because I had hyped myself up so much to read this book that I found it to be a complete flop for me. It would almost seem that the author would be on to something and just as he is ready to dive in, he holds back and moves to another character.It was a cute book that did not have an inch of depth. I can really see how this could have been a real winner of a book if the characters were fleshed out with some details. It needed to have several sub plots to make it over the hump.It made a nice Christmas stocking stuffer. I would have been better off sitting through ""Its a Wonderful Life"" once again."
2,suprisingly good,"Unfortunately, I couldn't get this book to download right on my tablet. I was pleased to find out I could return for a full refund within a few minutes after the purchase, which I did. However, after reading the sample, I had to finish it. So the next day I went to my local library....it was great! It really gets you thinking about your life and how it affects others. Would definetely recommend, especially for a summer read!"
1,terrible,This book is flat out awful. Don't waste your money. I had just finished Tuesdays With Morrie when I bought this. I would put this in the to 3 worst books tht I have ever read.
1,Not my idea of heaven,"I hated this book, as did everyone in my book club. Not uplifting at all or inspirational. The only reason I give it one star is that it is a very quick read. I was really hoping for more and was greatly disappointed."
1,Boring,"I hope the five people I meet in heaven are more interesting than this book. What a bore and on top of that I agree the writing is bad. The book reads like a first draft, instead of a well thought out story with meaning. Tuesday's with Morrie was a great book, but this was a disappointment."
5,A Very Interesting and Warm Read,"A very enjoyable book. A page-turner not knowing what was to come next. An easy to read book. My husband is reading it now. A ""good-feeling"" book."
1,Nothing like I thought it would be,"I bought this book hoping to get a little inspired but it did the opposite. Though I am confident I am going to heaven, I hope it is nothing like Mitch describes."
1,Dull Writing,"This book lacks the charm of Tuesdays with Morrie. The writing is flat and the story is rather old. The author has reworked material from Its a Wonderful Life, so the idea in the book is not original. Perhaps when the author meets his maker he can explain to the five people he will meet why he wrote this book, since the reason is not present in the text."
2,Five People You Meet in Heaven,"I was given this book as a Christmas gift, and I read it in a couple of hours. Albom presents a ""heaven"" without a God and without joy. I found it trite and depressing. As far as I can figure, Albom thinks heaven is a way to create closure and explanation for one's life that is not possible in this life. That makes far too little of both heaven and life on earth. If you are at all introspective or a believer in any kind of loving god, this book won't get you any farther along the road."
2,You won't miss anything,"Meh. Largely Schlock. If you like Lifetime movies, this one might be for you. Read ""what dreams may come"" for a better version that is less LMN."
1,Don't waste the hour it takes to read this book,"This book was given to me as a gift as I am a true fan of spiritually uplifting literature. The plot line was completely predictable and lost my interest immediately....but I finished it anyway. I regret wasting the time. Read The Celestine Prophecy instead. It is an oldie but a goodie that makes you think and leaves you with a new outlook on life, which is what this book poorly attempts to do....and fails."
1,Disappointing,"While it was a relatively interesting read, it was nothing I would've purchased on my own.It had a very disappointing ending, possibly because I was expecting heaven to be about truth, and the main character is lied to by one of the people he meets there. I won't say more on the subject for those who want to read it for themselves, but my copy is going up for sale. Definitely not a keeper."
1,Dissapointed,"The latest offering by Mitch Albom, The Five People You Meet in Heaven, is dissapointing, at best. I happen to enjoy listening to and reading Albom when he is in his best element, and that is sports. He is a fish out of water, to use a tired, old cliche, when it comes to this non-sports related fictional attempt.The story is trite and highly predictable. I won't spoil the ending for anyone who has not yet read the book, but several of the five people the main character meets in Heaven, are predictable, as well as his reaction to them.The book left me empty. My advise: For Albom, please stick to sports, and for the potential reader of the book, skip this one. Better luck next time Albom."
5,Judge for yourself...,"Anyone who gives this book a poor review isn't saying much about the book, but a lot about themselves. This is the kind of book that will comfort you when you feel like no one cares, and recommended for those who have lost a loved one."
1,"Please read ""Goodnight Moon"" instead!","If you're looking for a good book for the infantile mind, please go with a little classic like ""Goodnight Moon,"" or even the beautiful and underappreciated ""Runaway Bunny."" These books may not be more substantive than Albom's, though they certainly aren't any less, but at least they have integrity and aren't sentimental drivel."
1,Boring!,This book was terribly boring. I should have known after attempting to read Tuesday with Morrie and not finishing it twice. It is a quick read though for those of you that like to accomplish something in a day.
1,Wow,"What a waste of an evening. This book can be judged on several levels - all of them bad. It is poorly written, philosophically shallow, theologically trite, and only mildly amuseing. Mercifully, I got through it quickly. I would give it 0 stars if the option were available."
1,God-awful,"Bad writing and worse thinking. Sentimental, insipid, insulting, cliched. So the point of heaven is to make you feel good about yourself? Like, that's the important thing, that Eddie have strong self-esteem? What about God? What about the soul? What about other people? Nope, this is a book where Eddie dies and goes to heaven for a New Age pep talk. Could appeal only to people who think that how they FEEL is the most important thing in the universe."
2,Cool Whip,"An interesting idea although not very well presented. This book is more like the second or third draft of a possibly good book, both in substance and style. I was disappointed because I felt that it could have been so much better. It's the Cool Whip on top of a banana pudding: light, fluffy but you need to get to the pudding before you really enjoy it."
2,Didn't learn anything I didn't already know. Boring...lacking.,"Ok, so I was told by several people that ""The Five People You Meet In Heaven"" is such a great book. I just finished it in less than 2 days and I must say, I have no idea what all the fuss was about. I was unimpressed, bored, not at all moved, and I didn't learn anything that I didn't already know. Maybe if I had read this book when I was 15 I would have been moved but it wasn't anything new or clever. Books are like movies, ya have to watch and decide for yourself. To each their own I guess."
1,Reads like a bad children's book,"It has the feeling of a children's book with lame lessons, except that children's books are more interesting and have better characters."
2,Just OK,"I don't get all the hype surrounding this book, but what ever floats your boat. It never really grabbed me and a lot of the story line was just...odd. I really liked the ""One more Day"" book, so I was excited to read this, but it was pretty much a let-down."
4,Quick Feel-Good Read,"If you're looking for a quick feel-good book, this is it. Without a doubt, this book will keep you entertained. If you try to compare it against typical Christian theology, you will be disappointed. It is not theologically sound that way. Example - the main character swears in Heaven a few times. I'm pretty sure that would not happen. But, none the less, the book is compelling and entertaining. At times it is touching, as well.The main character is Eddie. He is in his 80's, it is his birthday, and, of course, he dies. Eddie doesn't feel like his life was worth anything. He doesn't feel like he accomplished anything or used his full potential. He meets five people in Heaven that show him otherwise.Good weekend read. Actually, at just under 200 pages, it is a one day read. Read it as entertainment and not a book about what Heaven will really be like. Enjoy it, I did!"
3,Something to Think About,The book was an easy read but it didn't grab your attention. I was on vacation on a cruise and it was the only thing I had to read so it forced me to finish the book. It did give you something to think about. The book had more impact on be after I read it. It made me stop and think about all the people I come in contact and how unkowningly I touched their lives. I've read better books on this subject.
1,"Good premise, terrible writing","I don't know if it what is called the ""sophomore jinx"" in the publishing industry is the problem here, or if Albom is a ""one hit wonder"", but this book is truly awful. The writing is dull, forced, unimaginative. That is all too bad because I like the premise of the book, and the best thing I can say about it is that the cover synopsis does a good selling job. So much for truth in advertising."
1,I want my money back !!!!,"Hopeless...Bunch of balony.After reading this book I realized that because of Morie's wisdom, ""Tuesdays with morie"" became a classic. Not because of the author."
1,The Five People you meet in Heaven,I would NOT recommend this book to anyone who will die or knows anyone who has died. What does that tell you!!!! Too much of the characters experience was extremely negative and so very sad. To be introduced to people you touched negatively and you didn't even know them??!!!! And now what do you do?? It just kills me (pun intended) that this author is making a mint on this book!
1,Whaaa!,"I truly believe if Albom had not had the previous bestseller, or the manuscript for this book was submitted under a pen name it would never have been published. It is simply awful. Poorly written, as if in a hurry; poorly edited -if at all; and plotless, one dimensional characters, and a preachy tone that was just too irritating to describe."
3,The Five People You Meet in Heaven,"If you're looking for an inspirational, uplifting story,don't read this book!Most characters live a sad existence.The story includes topics such as:violence toward children, loneliness, neglect, alcoholism,mean spiritedness, physical abuse, pyschological abuse,and lots and lots of personal unaccountability."
5,Think Before You Go TO HEAVEN,"I enjoyed this book, and read it before I saw the television special late last year. Eddie dies and goes to Heaven. As the story goes, he meets five people who Eddie had a strong influence upon during his lifetime.It's very surprising how the smallest occurances can effect ones' life. This book made me think alot, about people who I have met so far in my life time. I am fifteen years old, and I wonder did I open a door for someone, and change their life? Or did I accidently turn off a light, and the person after me, fall and brake his neck?This book had me thinking about my life, which is a very good thing to do!!"
2,Not too inspiring,"An easy and interesting read that I thought would have a bigger ending. The message was a good one but I expected a new spin on it. I would recommend it for someone who has not been exposed to the spiritual side of the meaning life but anyone who has read other books of this kind, I would say to take a pass."
4,The Five People You Meet in Heaven,It's a refreshing story. It opens my mind about other possibilities to be faced after death.
2,Pul eeze,I'm convinced...readers don't know a good book anymore. Talk about over-rated. Geez--then a boring moving on top of this? It was OK...I just don't see what all the hoopla was about.Readers--stop giving 5 stars to EVERY book you pick up. There's something called discernment. Get some the next time you're at the store.
4,Its Worth It,"It did not change my life, but it did give me some things to think about. I liked the concept, grew to idwntify wit the main character. Ultimately, I feel like it was time well spent."
2,"Fluffy and Interesting, With Sexiest Person...","Fluffy little piece, that didn't make it stink. prose a la The Alchemist, simple considerations about how life fits together, etc. Here is where it stinks...I didn't look at the author's name when I began the book.......and at the 3rd person he met in heaven, I KNEW it was a male author. I can't spoil it by saying any more than the author has no problem with violence towards women [a few moments of it] for the sake of saving a drunk. The author himself states in the first person [again not a spoiler] that every story can be viewed from two sides. If the Third Person met's story is viewed from the other side it stinks. It takes a totally average book and casts a sexist shadow over it...one I was not looking for so it was glaring. Don't bother with this one unless you HAVE to read it.....has a cute and tidy ending, if you want this kind of reading I would recommend The Alchemist."
1,Worst Book I've Ever Read,"I always finish what I start. With that said, I TRIED to make myself finish this book but it was so poorly written that I refused to torchure myself further."
1,never recieved my books,i never recieved the book because you messed up with the shipping. I got my money back a month alter for it but i still never read it. i will never buy anything from amazon again. noone even offered to resend the book free of cost which they should have because i waited for it for so long. 3 different books i had this problem with.
2,Poor Effort,To ask people to pay upwards of 20 dollars for a book that tries to mask its lack of depth in the all too common and vague vein of spirituality is outrageous!A shot of Jack Daniels is more inspirational...
1,Sorely Disappointed To Say the Least,I loved Tuesdays With Morrie but this thing was the worst book Ive paid money for in years. Disappointed? Putting it mildly. Just poorly written and confusing. Tried and tried to get something from this and finally gave up. I have a home library of 2000+ books and I left this in the motel. Hate to be this negative but what a bad book.
3,The Five People You Meet in Heaven by Mitch Albom [Hardcover],"Not as great as or as inspiring as I thought it was gonna be. I like Tuesday with Morrie much better, but then again it is different because this one is fictional. A quick read, pass time for commuting."
2,Disapointed,"When I bought this book, I was expecting one of those heart wrenching inspirational books, but I was very disapointed. This book is written as though it's for jouveniles."
1,Not worth the read,"I was wary of the book at the outset due to the fact that heaven-views rarely line up with the only authority on heaven. I felt that Albom's take was more like a drawn-out Twilight Zone episode. I kept expecting Rod Serling to appear and explain this story. If you want a better clue as to what heaven may be like, try John Eldredge's ""Waking the Dead."""
1,So bad it astonishes,"This novel is so bad, so over-hyped, so literally poor in its storyline, research, grammar, and literary value, I am just left astonished that anyone can write anything in its defense. For gosh sake, people, don't be taken in by this awful and crude drivel. I am just left shaking my head at the people who continue to buy this awful little nasty book."
1,are you kidding?,"Yes, this book brought me to tears....tears of pain. It is simply among the worst, most cliched, most sophomoric pieces of writing I've ever read. Albom is terrific on The Sports Reporters but he should leave fiction to the professionals. I suffered through the entire thing, hoping, waiting in vain, for some spark, some sign that this book deserves a spot on the bestseller list. Instead, it simply proved the theory that one bestseller is all you need to insure a spot on that list forever, regardless of the crap you publish. It's so bad, it will make you angry."
4,Tear Jerker,"I can see why this book is so popular. It is short and tugs on the ol' heart. That doesn't mean it isn't good, though. The story really made me gave me a lot to think about personally, just as Tuesdays with Morrie did. There is really something that anyone can relate to in the tale. This is a perfect gift because many will read it because of the length. Look for the movie soon."
3,Cute but not great,"This book came highly recommended on this hallowed corner of Amazon , but as an avid reader, I was left somewhat unimpressed. It's a cute little story, but it's short and quite pointless. It's not a bad read by any stretch, but I would have liked a more developed storyline instead of the whole book focusing on poor ol' Eddie's not-so-fascinating life."
2,What's the hype about?,"It's at least short and so my two stars but Albom's attempt at writing a fable left me feeling as if I'd been manipulated. I suspect a ghost writer or a panel of them at work here. This is a study in how hype can sell any book, I suppose, and from that standpoint it deserves to be studied as a pop culture creature."
2,Not the Best Guide to Heaven,"A soft read, with much imagination.But, if you want more than that, I would suggest picking up a book or two about people who have been there; i.e. 'Near-Death Experiences' such as Tiffany Snow (""Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life""), or the numerous research documents available through IANDS (International Association of Near-Death Studies). Imagination is fine - but this is the information age - getting a group synopsis of heaven through unrelated people with NDEs can get you a better window, without having to stretch it too much."
2,A disappointment,"After having read Tuesday with Morrie a few years ago and having liked that book ALOT, this one was a disappointment."
1,Cashing in,"If you look at the cover of this little book, you'll note it mentions Tuesdays with Morrie. Albom has written some admirable things. His latest endeavor isn't one of them. Cashing in on the Tuesdays fame along with media hype may allow Albom to reap the benefits for many years to come. Sad scenario for an author who has the ability but no imagination."
2,ewww,"I really really didnt like this book. i wasnt at all impressed. it was just sort of boring. i think it's a really cool idea but the book was just very terrible. i read it because i talked to someone who said it was so good they ""just couldnt put it down"".... i was really almost laughing because the book was so cheesy."
1,Ugh!,"In the words of the late classicist and scholar Moses Hadas, ""This book fills a much-needed gap."""
2,Disappointing :o(,"I am stunned that this book remains on the best seller list, as I considered it fair at best! I kept waiting for this book to get more interesting, which was all but a couple of hours since this book is incredibly short, but it just never got any better. The book is not horrible, but it seems to missing something. I guess what I'm trying to say is that if you find this book for a quarter at a yard sale & you have nothing better to read, go for it! Just my opinion...obviously a lot of people love this book, I just can't figure out WHY????"
4,The Five People You Meet in Heaven,"The first attractive part of the book that I pick this one to read must be the author. Since I have read his other book ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" , I've learnt something special from it. Anyway , this book ( The Five People You Meet in Heaven ) is written in a very interesting style. The author put the ending of the story at the beginning. And most of Eddie's life has been told by starting from his birthdays.As I travalled along with Eddie in 'heaven' , I felt at various times numb , shocked , happy , sad , afraid and nearly brought to tears. Eventhough I don't believe much in heaven but I take it as an acceptable tale about life and death , plus the fantasy view of heaven. At least , what I've learnt from this reading is , I'd better do something right now if I really want to do it , not just let it be only ""a could have been life""^_^ truantz_viii ^_^"
1,So disappointed,"I did a lot of research before buying this book. This was on the NY Times best-seller list, and I read about 20 reviews from amazon.com before purchasing. I had heard great reviews about this book and Tuesdays with Morrie. I am a girl who enjoys a great heart-warming and touching book. However, I found myself literally rolling my eyes while reading this book! It was incredibly corny and what would be called a typical ""chick's book"". I suppose the only reason that Tuesdays with Morrie was a lot better was because it's supposed to be a true story. Although this is based on a true character, the storyline is a bit far-fetched. Sorry, but this is a no-go for me."
1,Pretty darn depressing!,"I finished this short easy read quickly. I immediately went on to something a bit more uplifting as I found this book VERY depressing.Yes, each of the 5 people he meets explain their impact on his life or vice versa but the impact was always negative.It seemed to be a book about a guy that hated his life (except for his wife), hated his job but never did anything about it. Something really awful happens on each of his birthdays (his father's death, his wife's car accident, etc.)Then when he gets to heaven he finds out from his 5 people that he caused a man's heart attack, was responsible for a 5 year old burning to death, etc.I don't care for this much negativity."
2,As Peggy Lee sang...,"...""Is that all there is?"" Very disappointing; I am amazed at all the worship this book has inspired. Overly saccharine story and unsatsifying ending. I did like the scenes where the main character is reunited with his deceased wife, but that's not enough to recommend the book."
3,Pretty Good,"The book is a great idea and alot of it works. But some of the explanations, especially re. Eddie's father, just don't work at all and flaw the book. But it is still moving."
4,Lack of style compensated for by inspirational writing.,"I am a recent high school graduate and upon my departure one of my teachers gave me a copy of The Five People You Meet in Heaven.I couldn't put it down. I read it in 3 short days (it's an easy read).The book was insightful and very inspirational. It makes for a good ""life's lessons"" book. The book is based on the premise that ""our lives are more important than we actually know."" I did something with this book that I've never done, cried while reading. It teaches important lessons in life, love, loss, and sacrifice.Albom's writing style is amazingly simple, I guess I'm too used to Shakespeare :)The style isn't bad, it actually makes the book easy to read."
3,Over priced but interesting,"My daughter loved it and recommended it to me. I was surprised that it cost $13.99, the equivalent of an arm and a leg in the eBook market. And it was short! Not much bang for buck! However I bought it and set to. An interesting read with some valuable insights but more like a self help book than a novel."
4,Good not Great,"Finished reading THE FIVE PEOPLE YOU MEET IN HEAVEN. Beautifully written, but kind of disappointing ending. Still, worth a read."
5,An Interesting View of Heaven,An easily readable but thought provoking little book. Uplifting and well worth the small investment of time required.
5,Wonderful and inspiring short read,"Normally, small books like this won't get much of my attention. But I picked this one up, read the book cover, and it sounded great. So I purchased this little book. I'm glad now that I did. I read it non-stop and loved every page. I recommend this book to every reader who enjoys a story that's very inspiring."
2,"Author is creative, but way too cheesy to be engaging","I had high expectations for this book, given that Tuesdays with Morrie was as moving as it was. The author tries sell another book to the same audience, but ends up presenting a soap-opera/cartoon of a novel as a way to engage the same subject. There is clearly a need in this day and age for writing on the meaning of life, but this was not well done at all, and it was not worth plowing through the melodrama (as someone mentioned above) to get to the several, sentence-long, semi-compelling aphorisms. I actually couldnt finish reading the book it because it was so annoyingly overdone. It seemed way too artificial to present anything real on the meaning of life. Youre better off picking up a film by woody allen."
1,"Oh, no!","I flipped to the back of the book and was disturbed to find the five people that I'm going to meet in heaven:Shari LewisJoseph Stalin's brother-in-lawDick SargentDick YorkMr. Hooper from Sesame StreetNo offense, but I guess I'm a bit underwhelmed."
1,What A Waste Of Time,"Tuesday's with Morrie I loved, but this book really should not have been published because it was a waste of time. As a reader, I regret the time I wasted. There is nothing here that is inspirational. The story is silly, but the horrible writing was the real turn off."
1,"Incredibly shallow, banal, and silly","I bought this book with a great deal of anticipation. From the first page, I started to get a bad feeling about it. It is a book meant to capitalize on ""Morrie"" but it's so boring and shallow. I can't imagine how anybody would like it. It kind of turned my stomach, really, as I read on. I just had this sense of Mr. Albom thinking ""I can really fool them if I write this."" Sad, very sad. Don't waste your money. I read a lot of books. This one went in the trash."
4,What Eddie Found When He Met the 5 People in Heaven,"As I read Mitch Albom's books, I have come to notice that he seems eager to describe the difference between life in reality and in heaven. And The Five People You Meet in Heaven is no exception; Mitch seemed to show both Eddie's birthdays he had spent and his life after death caused by the accident in his amusement park. At first, Eddie was confused to see the 5 people in heaven, wondering why he was there. Then they let him know what he didn't realize before he died. The 5 people seemed to yearn for happier times than when they had lived. Unfortunately, I'm not really sure how this story ended right now, but I believe Eddie would feel happier eventually in heaven than before his death."
3,Okay Follow Up,"Tuesdays with Morrie was a classic that I have reread several times. This work does provoke some thought and touch the heart, but is not near as powerful as Mr. Albom's first work.It is worth the time however, and Mr. Albom is a terrific writer, whether it be a book or his column in the Detroit paper."
4,Powerful Tug of the Unknown,"Mr. Albom's interpretation of life after death is skillfully composed. Events during existence in this world for a person (specifically for Eddie, the main character) come alive and become much more meaningful when comprehended after one is dead. Each of the five people is brilliantly connected to the dead in a unique way. Their relationship with Eddie doesn't have to be a close one because every person is believed to be attached to another through coincidences. The happenings narrated of Eddie's life on earth are heartbreaking most of the time. Not in favor of a sad story, this fiction should only be reviewed as a mediocre creation but the writing style and the art of story telling by Mr. Albom are mesmerizing. Therefore, the fiction deserves an accolade for its prose."
3,An interesting and intriguing book,This book was fun to read. My friend told me about this book and so I bought it. The title intrigued me to find out whom the main character would meet in heaven. I read the book in one night. The storyline is exceptionally interesting and I was satisfied after finishing the book.
4,"Five people, Five impressions","The book is very fresh. The author uses a unique way to continue the story. You may notice this from the first page of the book, saying ""It might seem strange to start a story with an ending.""In the first chapter, author describes the events occurring one hour before Eddie (the protagonist) dies. When you flip through the pages you'll feel you are in the middle of a maze. Because the author used flashbacks to flow the story, the readers should connect all the plots together to understand what's going on. Don't worry!. A well-planned structure that the author brought in the book leads you a natural way-out from the maze as you read through.It sounds like a normal fantasy because the story takes place in heaven but, the book contains five serious lessons. For example, ""Holding anger is a poison. It eats you from inside.""After you finish reading this book, you'll crushed by author's story-telling skills and, just like me, you'll love the way the author writes."
5,I will never forget this book.....,"I first read this book a couple of years ago but started reading it again last Fall to a friend with terminal cancer. Because of the geographical distance between us, I began reading the book to him over the telephone. Although sometimes we could only get through one or two chapters a week, he would often call me and ask me to read to him. The book was a much better source of reassurance to him than I could ever have been that his life had far more meaning and purpose than he realized. The reinforcement that everything happens for a reason, that there is no such thing as coincidence, that we are all a part of each others' lives, and that love is eternal, was all a great comfort to him. I finished reading the book to him at his bedside less than 48 hours before he died. Although he could not respond verbally, I know he heard the message and was comforted, as I was."
4,~NICE GIFT BOOK~,"Touching story of Eddie whose life has been centered around an amusement park. While trying to save a little girl from harm, Eddie dies and goes to heaven where he meets five important people who he knew or didn't know in his life but who were an important part.Nice book for a quiet afternoon ~ gives inspiration that a person's life is important, no matter how mundane it is. There were several endearing passages throughout the book which make the reader sit up and ponder."
4,inspiring book,I really enjoyed this book. It was a nice change of pace & a new way of looking at your own life. I found it to be easy to read with serveral good ideas for quotes.
3,In a word....cute,"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a quaint story of Eddie, a maintenance mechanic at a seaside amusement park. Eddie has just died. This tale is his journey through the afterlife.I enjoyed ""The Five People..."" quite a bit - more than expected to say the least. I thought this would be a heavy-handed story, but was actually quite light and refreshing especially with its simple, yet powerful, message. It was amusing and fun in some parts, nostalgic and sad in others - pretty much as you might expect a trip towards heaven to be.I wasn't blown away though, as I found I wasn't particularily attached to Eddie in one way or another. And though the message appealed to me, I thought Albom had watered it down so that it would appeal to a broader audience.It's an easy read, and won't take you long. It's enjoyable, and worth the time, but by no means an amazing novel. It's good, but not great. I recommend it for a trip to the cottage, or a quiet Sunday afternoon."
4,makes me be ok with life,"Very good book! I have to say, it did not change my life as other reviews say it would. It made me smile and cry and the ending was beautiful. I think Mitch Albom puts a lot of himself in his books and I admire his perspectives. I recommend this book. It is ingenious. I myself sometimes wonder what my life is all about and though I don't believe my haven will be like Eddies, I like the idea. This book definitely makes me happy about my life even in the most boring, painful and difficult times. It makes me be ok with myself and life."
5,Great book!,"I saw this book a year ago and wanted to read it, and finally took it out of the library (sorry Amazon, but yes, the library)and I couldn't put it down. I stayed up way too late two nights in a row... but WOW what an ending! The Five People You Meet in Heaven was interesting,touching and easy reading and it certainly lived up to my expectations. This is a great book!"
4,"Makes you go ""Hmmmmmm....""","I read this book on a Sunday afternoon. It was written in a way to make the reader more insightful. It allowed the reader to ponder questions such as ""What is the meaning of life?"" and ""Why am I here?"" without being too preachy. The thing I liked about the book was that there was nothing particulary special about the main character. He was an everyday guy who lead what he felt was an ordinary life. This gives the rest of us hope with the idea that even though we may not be able to see it, our lives really do touch others in ways we never thought imaginable. This is a book that will encourage you to think about your own life and the way in which you want to live the rest of it."
5,Thought Provoking and Compelling,I must say I had been intrigured by this book when I heard about it. I bought it yesterday and could not put it down. It is an incredible story of spirituality and forgiveness. I highly recommend it to everyone.
3,A MUST Summer Read,"If you read only one book this summer, this should be it. Well written and a quick read. You'll pick it up and before you know it, it is over. You'll laugh, you'll shed a few tears, and most of all, it will make you think. If you've ever been to a fair or a carnival as a child, you'll feel like you're back there. The feel-good book of the summer. It's a book that you can read over and over."
5,Inspirational,"An amazing story about a man we can all relate to in some degree or another. It deals with one of the questions we say to ourselves, ""What have I accomplished in life?"", ""Have I made any impact on anyone's life?""The five people Eddie met in heaven really took me by surprise. Only 1 out of the 5 people I expected him to meet in heaven were there. The rest took me by complete surprise which drew me further into the story. Eddie's story tells you that even the smallest things he did in life have had a huge impact on another or the sacrafices people made for him, things he took for granted, had a huge effect on the person he is today.This is a book that everyone can enjoy, even those who are non-religious. I highly recommend it."
4,Don't get put off by the title!,"I thought this was going to be a religious book but I had heard the book was good so I turned inside and read a page. This is a great book. Aside from the story, which you become hooked on as the book progresses, the writing is excellent. I love a book that challenges you with at least one word. I rarely recommend a book but this one just calls out to me."
5,Heatwarming,This is one of those books you want to read again and again to remind yourself why you do the things you do and why you would feel this way.the ending is unexpected but so completely perfect. I'll definitely be reading this again.
5,"Deep, but enjoyable.",This book kept me guessing who he would meet next. I liked the story and liked how it was a deep but simple read at the same time.
2,Missing something,"I just wasn't moved. I WANTED to like it, but the writing felt dumbed down. The Interesting premise ended up disappointing me."
4,Loved it,First book I have read in years and I absolutely loved it I would recommend this book to every one
4,A short good read,A very interesting look at the people you very well may meet in heaven. The ones that you have effected the most when you were alive or their lives effected yours the most. And finding out where your heaven is here on earth.
5,Love Mitch Albom,"I have purchased this book many times over, from the time I first read it I wanted my friends and family to read it also. So I always purchase copies of this book where ever I see it, and hand them out."
2,"Interesting Premise, but Too Sentimental","I usually don't like Mitch Albom's books. The fact that they're bound like oversized greeting cards, I think, is symbolic of the excessive sentimentality in his stories. This book, his first novel, is no exception.The reason why I gave it two stars instead of one is because the premise is experimental and interesting. But, Albom's sugary prose and (ugh!) dialogue nearly sent my pancreas into shock. The way the book starts, with a potentially gripping rescue of a little girl, could have sounded more fresh than it did. And the dialogue between Eddie and his wife was very over-the-top.Bottom line, if you liked ""Tuesdays with Morrie"", then you might like this book. But I didn't, so I don't. Sorry."
5,the five,This book has a great story line. It takes your heart along a warming journey. Highly recommend this and tuesdays with morrie
4,E D D I e-------------------library book,MITCH ALBOM--5/23/1958--book 9/23/2003.Eddie--a wounded WAR VET..he was a pilot.He is 83 yrs old..he save a child from a horrible accident andis killed in the process.He meets 5 people in HEAVEN...who help him realize his lifewas not meaningless.A PARABLE!AS WITH all ALBOM books it is a nice SIMPLE READ!bbp63okc okretired
1,Is that all there is?,"I am really disappointed because my friends really talked this book up. I keep waiting for this to get better, but it isn't. I have 100 pages to go, but am not impressed - it is just so Bridges and Cheese. I am glad I didn't buy it. There is such a plethora of good and sustaining literature out there, I just don't understand how books like this get on the best seller list other than it is short and I guess the majority of people don't get introspective about their lives so therefore need books like this and the Cheese book to show them what is right in front of their faces. It bothers me when I have wasted my valuable reading time on a book like this.One point for the dedication. The best part of the book is the dedication to his uncle. My suggestion is to pick up the book in the store, and read the dedication standing there, and look at the picture in the back, but don't buy the book."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"Now, I love to read, but only so much. It says a lot when a book has me reading all night after I buy it just because I felt like I needed to. The book, for a series of a few conversations and flashbacks, is strangely moving and gripping... fully of shocking, depressing, and wonderful moments.Mitch Albom basically creates a concept of heaven where you speak with people whom you affected or were affected by to gain the full understanding of your life (in the book, the main character is a veteran who spends the rest of his life working in as an amusement park handyman/repairman) and all it's up's and down's.DEFINITELY worth a read no matter what kind of books you usually enjoy."
1,as deep as a puddle,"If you are looking for something to make you think, to make you laugh, to make you cry... keep looking. If you have even once thought about why you are here and for what purpose (higher or otherwise), then you don't need to read this book. Depth-free zone."
3,When You are Ready to Go Past the Adult Fairy Tales..,"For a light reminder of life's spiritual mirror, The Five People You Meet in Heaven represents a great introduction into the world of spirituality, and life after death, and how our lives all have a purpose. When you are ready to go deeper, read the near-death, purpose stories by Betty Eadie (embraced by the light), Tiffany Snow (psychic gifts), or John Edward (crossing over). These highlight the deeper Spiritual things. Indulge yourself! Continue on the path to be a higher intelligence in the universe! The world needs it, doesn't it?"
2,meh....,"I thought the first couple of chapters were good in developing a story about an interesting character, but halfway through the book, it got a little cheesy and formulaic. At this point it seemed like every person Eddie met in heaven was someone he wound up accidentally killing and that this was some way to acknowledge it and get rid of his guilt.I liked Albom's books about Morrie much better. I think he writes well with a lot of meaning when the story is about someone or something in real life rather than something he made up."
4,Makes you think...,"Today is Eddie's birthday... This line has caused me to reflect on several of my birthdays and to realize that with each passing year they become less and less of an event.Eddie is a maintenance man at an amusement park who thought his life had no meaning and that he made no impact on anybody. Five people appear to Eddie immediately after his death and prove him wrong.After reading this book, I began to wonder what five people I would meet in Heaven (or wherever I end up). Perhaps a co-worker I don't really care for, perhaps a best friend from years past, or the person I accidentally cut off in traffic this morning.This book has caused me to re-examine my daily interactions with people and to wonder how those interations have impacted both of us. Have I made a difference in anybody's life without even knowing it? Do the people who made a difference in my life know they did?"
3,I just don't get it.,Maybe I was looking for some great words of wisdom. A story to make me laugh and cry and to teach some of life's great lessons. What I got was a story about a man who died and met 5 people in heaven. They each had a lesson for him and the lessons weren't even worth savoring. I like Mitch Albom on the radio and I guess that I should read Tuesdays with Morrie. But this book just didn't do it for me.
4,A small slice of heaven,"I enjoyed this book. It made me pause and reflect on my daily interactions with family, friends and co-workers. We don't realize the impact a small gesture or comment can make in another person's life. Eddie, the main character, didn't feel he accomplished much during his life, but realized his purpose after meeting each friend in heaven. I would recommend this book...a short heartwarming read."
4,five people you meet in heaven,This Book was great. I really enjoyed it. never put it downI will read more books by this author. he is brilliant.
2,Just a warning for Christians...,"For Christians hoping that Mitch Albom's version of heaven will at least slightly resemble the heaven that the Bible tells us to hope for, don't get your hopes up. This book is a clever idea of what heaven would be if it were entirely ""self-focused"". AKA, don't worry, God won't get in our way of fun once we're up there. It's all about us. After much enjoying, Tuesdays with Morrie, I was very dissapointed. But, I am a biased Christian who looks foward to the heaven described in the Bible, not in a novella."
2,Shallow melodrama,"I found almost nothing about this book convincing: the characters were largely stereotypical and the author's lessons seemed calculated to appeal to a mass audience, rather than based on any honest, life-earned wisdom. Phrases like, ""Every life has one true-love snapshot"" may strike us as sweet, but they are neither wise nor true."
2,"I really, really, really, wanted to like this book, but...","As much as I loved Tuesdays With Morrie, I can not bring myself to love this story. I think Mitch Albom had the right idea. I think the message is noble and true. But instead of being uplifting and intelligent the whole book seemed naive and awkward. Not much rang true in the plotting and the material just was not up to standard. i think the plot made for a very good short story. Something that people can enjoy and appreciate, but the novella form is way too long for what Albom had in mind.I felt like this was a pretty shallow exploration of mortality, ethics, spiritual maturity and the basic lessons of life. Maybe I was expecting way too much, but it seems to me that Mitch missed Morrie more than he knows."
2,Dissapointed,"After reading ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" I thought great things of this author. Unfortunately I was very dissapointed in ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"". I had a difficult time getting through this one due to its slow pace and boring content. This could have been a great book, but the author missed the boat here. Read ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" and leave this one on the shelf."
2,Just OK,"The book was just ok. I was longing for a ""hard to put down"" book, but this certainly was not it. I kept going through it thinking that the next chapter or the next person he meets will be better, maybe have a good lesson to teach, say something that will really make you think. But it never really happened. The parts that were the best were when he spoke of his wife and the true love that they had."
4,Who are your 5 people?,"We never know whose life we will impact. Will it be positive or negative? How will we know? When, if ever will we know? Mitch does a fabulous job of showing us how our actions and decisions just might possibly affect others in ways we may never know. Just to be safe, be kind to others."
2,Not my idea of heaven,"I had hoped this book would tell of how ordinary people make a difference to others in positive ways that they may never know about until they die. So I was surprised to see that the majority of the book is NOT positive - it seems like Eddie has had just as much (or more) negative influence as positive on the majority of the five people he meets. I also found it odd that he could experience so much physical discomfort in heaven. While I agree with the idea of a life review once you reach the Other Side, I sure hope it is nothing like this ! Eddie is a sympathetic character, and the author is a good writer, but overall, this book did not inspire me."
4,The Five People You Meet in Heaven,"After reading other reviews about this book I decided to purchase it as an extra to help me qualify for the free super saver shipping! It was a very easy, fast read! I read it in 2 days, but it could have easily been read in 1 day if I would've had the time! It really makes you think about how you live your life and who YOUR five people you meet in Heaven will be!"
5,A Great Book,Don't read this book without a box of tissue around. It is well written and even though it is fiction it is a reminder that we are all important to someone... even someone we may not personally know or recall. Highly recommended.
1,just an afterschool special,"Well, nothing against all the positive reviews, but I really did not like this book. It had all the subtlety and nuance of an afterschool special.I mean, what a great premise: a grizzled, injured war vet with a guilty conscience and a dead-end life gets a chance to re-examine his earthly existance with the aid of five heavenly guides. Wow. Unfortunately I thought the book simply failed to deliver a good story.I found it way too sweet and pat and I really could not feel like I got to know the main character at all. Every situation was cliche, and every ending was just so pat. I kept waiting for the grand insight that would make it all worthwhile, but it never came.Instead, made-for-TV quality expositions on heaven and the meaning of life. Too bad."
1,"Not a ""Tuesdays with Morrie""","""Tuesdays with Morrie"" was a wonderful book. Even the TV version was enjoyable (Jack Lemmon - how could you go wrong)! This book is different; this fable is not believable and draws some strange conclusions (especially in regards to the father) to come to the predictable ending. For me, this book was a major disappointment. The reviews on Amazon are not indicative of how I believe most will feel upon completion of this book.My sister, who anxiously wanted to read this book after some talk show endorsement, was sadly disappointed as well. She has not read ""Tuesdays"" and is not eager to do so after reading this book. That is too bad.I suggest going to the store and trying to read a few chapters before buying it. I kept saying that is has to get better than this. Unfortunately it did not. My suggestion is to read ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" instead and pretend that this book does not exist. The idea of the book was a good one, but the execution of this idea is another story."
4,Very well written but a little odd,"I liked this book a lot; however, parts of the book were confusing. Otherwise, a very well written book and interesting concept. Everyone should read this book regardless of whether they believe in Heaven or not."
4,Victor,"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a book that I enjoyed reading very very much. The book follows Eddie, and 83-year-old mechanic who works at a theme park. One day a new ride that takes people up a tower and then drops them before slowing to a stop breaks. Eddie saves a girl from being crushed but in the process he dies. He is met in heaven one by one by five people who tell how eddie affected or was effected in their life. The book overflows with emotional chapters and twists that perplex the reader to read forward and explains many things that happen earlier on in the book. This to me was a great read and I strongly recomend it to anyone to read.Mitch Albom is a fantastic author in my eyes just because of how good of a job he did on that book."
4,Beautiful gem,"My almost 14-year old daughter bought this book for me last night because she loved it when she read it last year for one of her classes. I was so touched that I wanted to show her that I was anxious to read it that I began reading it last night, right after she brought it home. I finished it this morning, and have to say that it is one of those books that I will never forget. If I were to find fault in it I would wag my finger at the cliches; but in doing so I think would be wrong to the spirit and heart of this story. I have never read anything by Albom before but I will be looking up his ""...Morrie"" novel at the local library. His idea of heaven is fanciful in a way but also a very meaningful interpretation. A lovely fable that could be read and appreciated more than once."
3,Great Expectations,"I loved ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" and expected even more from this book. Sadly, it was a let down. It's worth reading and poses some thought-provoking ideas, but it wasn't as ""soul-full"" as I'd hoped. Naturally, I was near tears when Eddie meets his 5th person -- only a robot wouldn't be. I suppose any book which deals with the topic of heaven will nearly always set itself up to be accused of ""missing something"", and this one is no exception: what's missing is us."
3,"A little too ""preaching"" for me","I read this one very quickly (but it's not a terribly long novel anyhow). Without being ""preachy,"" there is still a bit too much ""preaching"" in this one. Its about this guy who dies, and supposedly there are 5 people you meet when you first arrive in Heaven. They are there to teach you lessons about your life, and help you come to terms with your own life. A decent read, but I felt let down in the end because it didn't really surprise me or anything."
4,Good Book to Read,"The Five People You Meet in Heaven is a fast-read that goes through and teaches life lessons. It was a good book, with simplistic writing, and easy concepts to understand. It makes you think on how the world works and who you have affected in your life. This book was emotional at times, and really got you into the book. The reason I rated this book a four because the book lacked excitement in some parts of the story where I just got bored and tired of reading, but overall it was a good book."
5,Highly Recommend,"Totally uncomplicated - very easy to read - I could not put it down. It has changed the way I ""see"" things. Lots of subtle lessons in this little book! Michael Albom has a unique way of getting your attention - and initiating a soul search."
4,what life is all about,"a tale of anamolous convention that molests the notion of unequivical sanctimonious congruity, but does so with a passion that nearly eclipses that wondrous and loving book titled ""what life is all about"" by MO. both, though entirely different, reach and strike at the heart of the human condition. if you don't own both correct your err now."
5,Pleased Everyone,I bought ten copies of this book and gave them as gifts. A wonderful thing to share and spread around. Thank You Mitch Albom!
2,Not anything like Tuesdays with Morie,"I think Mitch had a great deal of pressure on him after writing ""Tuesdays with Morie"". He had quite an act to follow and was not successful at it. I got the impression that he was trying to write ""It's a wonderful Life"" with different characters. I cannot believe people are saying that it was a tear jerker. I thought the ending was very hokey and I left with the feeling that his life was the way he pictured it, worthless. I kept thinking there would be some great revelation. There was none. The whole book was a disappointment. The best thing about it was it was over quickly!"
3,Good Advice!,"On the advice of my sister, and most anyone else who had read this I almost felt compelled to pick it up. It was good advice.Eddie is the head maintenance worker at the Ruby Pier. This is a life that he deeply despises; he blames his father, his war wound, and himself for never leaving the pier... for doing nothing with his life. Eddie dies at the pier, but his real journey begins after his death, in heaven. Here he meets five people each of whom has been waiting for Eddie to help him understand why he lived his life and how no one's life is truly wasted.I enjoyed the book greatly, and even though I liked Tuesday's With Morrie better, the lessons that Eddie learns in heaven hit home as well. It would be a shame to let this one pass, it's a quality story with a lot of imagination and it's a quick read too."
3,"A great lesson to learn, yet too easy","This story delivers what it promises. It's easy to read, and not recommended by me for people who are in search of a challenge. This simple, easy to read book, took me less than an evening to complete. First of all, I believe the plot was a little weak in most of the book and stronger in other places. In some chapters, the author seemed to just ramble on. Here is the a short outline of the book. A man (Eddie) passes a way, and learns a valuable lesson from five people he meets in heaven. He finds that heaven is not just a lush garden, but five people who affected your life and they explain the meaning of your life. I found myself getting lost some parts, and getting bored in others. It seemed to even out to become just at a rating of OK, because I found the book a precious lesson to learn by all people. As I have said before, this book is not recommended by me for people who enjoy challenging novels. It wasn't as thought-provoking as I imagined."
3,Similar to Albom's Other Work,"Albom's book is touching and moving and similar in style to Tuesday's With Morrie. The book takes you through someone's life using a trip to Heaven after their recent death as the vehicle to introduce you to the characters and events. You either like Albom's writing style and abilities or you do not. It's not for everyone (as with many popular books, the reviews on this are all over the place). His work is analogous with the Hallmark or Disney Channels on tv. It's a bit schlocky and designed to pull at the heart-strings, but it's well-written for what it is. If you are willing to use this book to get you to look at yourself and your life from another perspective, you will find value in it. If you are simply looking for a good story, you will likely be disappointed."
2,It's really not the best...,"I was excited to read this book b/c it's been given so much praise, but I was so disappointed. It's a semi-sweet book which, from start to finish, was superficial. Superficial is fine if a book is entertaining as it goes on, but this was just sort of a dull story in my opinion. I can appreciate Albom's idea of this man's journey to heaven, but his version pretty cliche and trite. I was excited to read this, but was really let down...sad."
5,The best book for the soul,This was a wonderful book it had a lot of things that deal with the everyday life. It has a lot of things that can teach something to each human being. This book can read it any one. It's easy to read and it will make anyone feel better. It's a touchy book. It would make you think who will be the five people you'll meet in heaven. Give it a try that you would no regret it.
2,Wannabe wonderful life,"Read this book for my book club. Normally I will read a 500 plus page book in 5 hrs. This book took me days. Just couldn't get into it. So maudlin, sappy and a wanna be Wonderful Life. Jimmy Stewart never would have acted in it, no less read the script. No substance, no heart, no feeling. Almost like a trivial look into the after-life. Don't know how it stayed on the best seller list. I now have to go to my book club, where I am sure everybody loved it.To each his own."
1,5 Reasons Not to Read This Book,"The title of Mitch Albom's new book sounds interesting enough and could be developed into a great story; but I couldn't find it here. The author skirmishes into the lives and histories of five people whom 'Maintenance Man Eddie' may or may not have known; but doesn't do anything to improve the main character'sunderstanding of his pitiful and worthless life. I found thebook to be depressing to read. The only positive thing I tookaway was the brief time it took to read. It would have been amistake to invest more time or money. (David in Roanoke, Va.)"
4,Heartwarming read,"My brother handed me this book this past Xmas w/ the inscription, ""I hope you're one of my five."" I still get choked up when I think about that, but w/ that said this book addresses the idea of Heaven as a place where your life's explained to you by people you knew the most or least, but each of whom had a large impact on it in some way.Mr. Mitch Albom cleverly writes an emotionally endearing book which allows one to think, ""Who do I want to explain my life to me when I'm done w/ my time here?"" Great book and an extremely fast read.Four stars because it's the type of book which you feel ends too quickly. Otherwise a 5."
4,"Short, easy to read, and fantastic","But i didn't give it a 5 star. It had it's moment, and i won't lie and say i didn't cry, but some of the people he met just didn't seem appropriate... you're dead, there are 5 people you meet that you most affected, and you have to wonder are these really the important ones?But i do agree that the end makes it all worthwhile.Just don't have unrealistic expectations, and you'll enjoy this book."
5,unread,"The book was highly recommended by a friend in church, in my Bible study group, but I have not had a chance to read any of it as of today. Look forward to reading it."
2,movie is better,"Overall, I loved the plot of this book. Whether you're religious or not, it really makes you think. Unfortunately, I found the movie to be far better than the book, which is something I normally never ever say. But, the way Mitch Albom writes really bothered me. I can't put my finger on it just yet, but I really didn't enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed the movie."
3,"Can't hurt, and maybe will help a little.","A friend of mine gave me this book three years ago, but I had never read it (and thought I had given it away!) because I expected it to be sentimental mush. I have recently had a great loss, however, and dug the book out of my closet to read with no expectations except that I thought it might help me or, at least, it couldn't possibly make things worse. I read it in two days and enjoyed it very much. It is a nicely written, uncomplicated story, plainly told, and, perhaps, has given me a little hope and comfort. This is a book for those who are suffering the agony of grief and looking for anything that will, even briefly, ""make it better""."
1,The Emperor's New Clothes Part II...,"I thought ""Tuesdays with Morrie"" was sanctimonious drivel but this preachy, sappy, appallingly badly-written rubbish beggars belief. How on earth do writers like Albom get their worthless stuff published when so many better writers struggle for years? What alarms me most is that I suspect Albom himself is taken in by his guru-like persona and that we might be in line for some more of his potted wisdom before long. Blech!"
2,No thank you,What is this book? I can tell you what it is not: it is not original. It is not compelling. It is not reasonably priced. It is not intelligent. It is not wise.Wait: it is preachy. That's what it is.Read at your own risk.
5,Great Book,"It's a very very good book that makes you think about the things that you have done in your life and the people you have met. It also makes you wonder who you will meet in heaven once you're dead.I couldn't help it but it made me cry. I highly recommend it. The quotes are also fascinating.My favorite quotes are:""Sometimes when you sacrifice something precious, you're not really losing it. You're just passing it on to someone else""""All parents damage their children. It cannot be helped. Youth, like pristine glass, absorbs the prints of its handlers. Some parents smudge, others crack, a few shatter childhood completely into jagged little pieces, beyond repair."""
3,"Light read, overly philosophical","Five People was a reasonably good, light read. Albom tries a bit too hard to leave his message throughout the book. It was a bit predictable, but still had stories that I will remember."
3,"Liked it, did not love it.","I read a review of this book in the Wall Street Journal, of all places, and decided to read it based on that. It is a very quick read, not a ""great book"", but certainly made me think about the people whose lives we cross and how we might affect them. A book that makes you think can't be a waste of reading. Some parts of it are indeed saccarine and maudlin but the basic premise keeps me thinking. I would recommend it maybe when it comes out in paperback, or getting it from the library."
3,Good but average!,"Mitch Albom's book, ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"" was, in my opinion just average. I enjoyed specific aspects of the book, like ensuring that we forgive one another and that the people we meet in this lifetime, or the one's that proceeded us have a profound effect on our lives. I thought that was very thought provoking. However, with that said, I was looking for more of Albom's take on Heaven and what his interpretation of what it will be like. I would recommend the book to others. Again, an average read."
5,Best Of Mitch's Books yet!,"I have already read several of Mitch Albom's books, but so far, this is one of my favorites. I've read it twice, and given it to three friends for gifts.It's something I've always wondered about personally,and never thought anyone else did, as well."
3,The Five People You Meet in Heaven,"I enjoyed the book. I can't rave about it but I found it to be an enjoyable, if short, read.Parts of the book are very touching. For example, when Eddie meets his fourth person I began to tear up (thinking about what I would do when I reach that stage in my life). Other parts are just strange. I'm still trying to figure out why Eddie meets his first person.The fifth person Eddie met was a surprise to me. Not because he met that person but because of the bearing that meeting has on a conversation Eddie has earlier in the book (with his second person).To me, the book ended rather abruptly. I didn't get a good sense of completeness or resolution. Almost as if the writer didn't know how to end the story."
4,Good Air travel read,"to the more critical reviewers, i think they take themself too seriously...perhaps mediocre, failed people in life who constantly over-critisize other's efforts in reflection of their own miscomings. The book was simple, but uplifting. An easy read that should have the reader thinking idealistically over their own life and really what meanings it may have. Perhaps we have too much self interest, especially as americans, that we forget the entire scope and revelation of life...how we touch others we know and others we dont."
5,Heaven -- and Morrie,"I bought this book because I loved Tuesdays with Morrie, the author's first book. Morrie, an elderly college professor, stricken with a Lou Gherig's disease gave his best till the end. Morrie is an inspiration to us all and his memory lives on.The Five people You Meet in Heaven basically asks us to say what we need to say to those we love and respect. A simple message, not nearly as touching as the message in the author's first book.I recommend Optimal Thinking-How To Be Your Best Self to obtain the simple thinking style that Morrie used to make the most of every situation -- including his darkest moments. I recommend The Five People with the proviso that you do not have the same expectations that you had from reading Morrie."
5,great,"great, this was a gift and, Grandfather enjoyed it. Amazon is a terrific place to buy these items. Can't say much else as I said before this was a gift"
1,Talk about a Grim fairy tale,"This was the most depressing, horrible, miserable, ridiculous etc., etc., book I have ever had the misfortune to read. So presumably if you live a sad, bitter, painful and lonely life on earth, then eventually you will find out the reasons why - or some unbelievable drivel as to why and then - JOY, up to heaven to meet the celestial being who deemed that this was your lot. I would trade this fairy tale ""everlasting"" life for a few good years here below. Don't waste your time on this rubbish."
4,"It's okay if you don't believe in it, just enjoy a little like chicken soup for the soul kind of feel.","It's a feeling of life. What you wonder, but without the feeling that you have to pick a religion. It's just life with a little mix of folk, involve with people, a little of chicken soup for the soul, and a little enjoyment. No, let's not put Jesus and the bible in this. Nope, just a thought of the what ifs in life after. Good read that's all. Got me a little teary too."
3,Interesting Book,"It was one of those books where you couldn't put it down. I had to finish the book the moment I picked it up. I would've put 5 but the ending was pretty lame. There really wasn't any conclusion and you're left wondering what will happen to the main character. I liked it, but not enough to strongly recommend it to someone."
4,Well thought out.,"A beautiful story told by piecing together other stories viewed from many angles. The story is well planned, every chapter has a perfect transition to the next. It made me finished the book in 2 days, I couldn't put it down... And this is coming from somebody who doesn't like to read."
4,Fascinating!,"One more wonderful book by Mitch Albom. His style is simply fascinating, taking you back in times of Eddie, relating it to what and why of life's little happenings. Thought provoking.. His adaptation of what the journey onto heaven is very pleasing. A wonderful book to read."
3,Simplistic easy reading,I had to force myself to get past the first chapter of this book. The author's tries too hard to develop a unique style (movie-like) to move the reader from one place in time to another. The shifts end up being very abrupt and annoying.I couldn't get myself to connect with the main character and his life. The passages about the people he met in heaven could have been better written. I was easy reading with a good overall message but that is about it.
5,The five people you meet in heaven,Amazing story of the life of a man. Type of that doesn't come together until the last minute then it all makes sense.
4,Really makes you stop to think,This book makes you step back and examine your own life which is somewhat uncommon in today's literary world. How you may have impacted the life of someone else without even knowing it... how our lives all interwine with one another. A short and quick read with a long-lasting impact. I enjoyed this so much that I went out and bought several copies to give as Christmas presents. Definitely a tear-jerker.
2,boring,This book is overhyped. The subject is interesting and should be a delight for the readers imagination. Unfortunately the author was not; the accounts were uninspiring and very predictable.
5,Seriously a fantastic book,"My husband bought this book for me for Christmas. I read and finished this dynamic and amazingly wonderful book this morning. I would do the book harm if I tried to summarize the eloquence of the characters, the situations and the aspects of Heaven that I have never before encountered. ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"" had me thinking (and crying) about who has touched my life or whose life I have changed just by going about and living. I am a high school English teacher and this book will be high on my list of recommendations. What a fabulous literary and life achievement!!!"
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book as soon as it was on the market because not only do I love Albom's previous work, I usually like stories that have a spiritual angle. I seem to be the minority from the reviews, but I was really disappointed. Although very easy to read, I kept hoping the book would get better or touch me in some way. I just didn't enjoy the book and found the message off base for me personally."
3,"Fun to read, but not a masterpiece","I thought this book was a fun read, but not a masterpiece. Granted, the author took advantage of his ""poetic license"" and made a lot of logical leaps, but works of fiction should not be criticized for logic, and neither should faith.As far as some positive aspects are concerned, the language flowed well, dialogues were fun, the set up of the book with Eddie's various birthdays was original. Have fun with it!"
1,Read The Traveler's Gift instead,"This book is similar to ""The Traveler's Gift"" by Andy Andrews that came out in 2002. But The Traveler's Gift is much more inspiring book to read. I was expecting ""The Five People You Meet In Heaven"" to be heartwarming and uplifiting, instead it is depressing."
3,Very Overrated,"Having read this book shortly after reading Albom's ""Tuesday's With Morrie"" (which was far better and way more original) I have to say I was not very pleased with it. Every now and then I like to pick up a copy of a book from the Bestseller's List and see if it deserves all the hype it's been recieving. Sometime's it does, sometime's it doesn't, such as in this case. I thought it was a fine book for what it is, but I've seen this plot before in other books. the beginning starting at the end was interesting but again, I've seen it done before and in a better written way. It's not a bad book, it's just not what one might think it would be, given all the hype it recieved. It's similar to ""Tuesday's With Morrie"" but not nearly as good. I say pass it and pick up ""Tuesday's With Morrie"" if you haven't already read it. Just don't believe all the hype ""The Five People You Meet In Heaven"" has recieved."
4,Four Stars for the Five People You Meet In Heaven,The Five People You Meet In Heaven by Mitch Albom is an incredible book. It makes you think and contemplate life. It is amazing how this book elaborates on the idea that one person's short-comings is another persons miracle (in a sense).
3,Tuesdays was better,"I liked this book but enjoyed Mitch Albom's first best seller, Tuesdays with Maurie, a lot better. When I bought this book I was expecting to be blown away like I was with the first book but I was only mildly entertained."
2,A best seller???,Why is this book considered a best seller?I just started buying books again after I found most stories to be boring and redundant. I thought I would start at the best sellers list hoping to find a compelling story.It looks like I'll need to find myself a new hobby and buying best sellers will fall to the bottom of my to-do list.
1,"Hard to believe, it is so passe....","I was born in 1940. I know the war years. I would think that the five people I would meet are from the 40's, 50's, 60's and 70's.I guess that a series on tv is coming up. My parents lived through the 2nd world war years. I find these stories trite and boring. I know better ones from the people who were there. The years of the cold war, the Korean war, the Bay of Pigs, etc., how can this book be socially relevant? I did not buy this book."
1,There should be a 'no star' rating,A typical American 'feel good' book. This book is definitely a must read for anyone who still holds on to the belief that people are generally good and that there is no greed in this capitalist world. It's a way of keeping the wool over their eyes for just a little longer. Why not snuggle down to this book while drinking your mulled wine at Christmas in front of an open fire.What most people fail to realise is that there is no impirical evidence of the existence of heaven. It a tool devised by religious institutions as a form of control. This book (probably un-wittingly) furthers the religious cause by linking the concept of heaven to the daily routine of life.There is no such thing as heaven and your life has no meaning - get over it!
3,Perplexing,"I've read 'The Five People You Meet in Heaven' three times but the fundamental premise continues to cause disquiet. The fault undoubtedly lies within me, because the text is both lucid and encompassing. The two issues that continue to trouble my curiosity are these; if there are only five people in that vast expanse, it is highly unlikely that we'll see them, let alone meet them; and what a dry old meeting it would be if they all turned out to be Amish or Mormons or, perish the thought, Jehovah's Witlesses. I'll read it again in the hope that my despair is unfounded."
1,Regurgitated drivel,"Talk about a THIRD RATE, predictable, and BORING story... I STRUGGLED to finish this over-promoted, over-rated book just so I could give an honest review. My advice to Mr. Albom: Stick to reporting baseball scores or, at a minimum, write a first person novel about an arrogant, mediocre sports writer who tries but fails to become a true life novelist. Mr. Albom is no Ring Lardner. Note: I would have given this book 0.1 stars but it was not an option. I chose 1 star over 0 stars because of the paper used for the book."
1,The better mousetrap,"""It's A Wonderful Life"" meets ""Goodbye, Mister Chips"" with a quick salute to ""A River Runs Through It.""If you admire books that are poorly written but are still clever commercial snares, then you should buy ""Five People."""
1,Disappointing,"This book was so disappointing it left me in a bad mood the rest of the day. It begins by making you believe that Eddie at 83 years old never married Margarite. All he had of her was just the photo of her waving goodbye. Later on in the book you find out that he did marry her and had a loving marriage to her.It just doesn't measure up to ""Tuesday's With Morrie""."
5,The five people you meet in heaven,"I had to read this book for high school. In all the books I've ever read this has to be my favorite. No other book even comes close to this one. Each of the lessons are wonderful, and life lessons. If I could only read one book for all my life this would be the book. If you're looking for a book to read this is the perfect book!!"
4,Good read when you're in the mood for warm and fuzzy,I really enjoyed this book. It is a fast and easy read and you feel warm and fuzzy at the end. Perfect for curling up with on a chilly afternoon.
5,The best book I ever read,I thought this was an amazing book. It was so different in its ideas of heaven that you are immediatley drawn into the story. The character of Eddie really doesn't know why he mattered in the world but that is what the five people explain to him. Its a quick read but as touching and great as Tuesdays with Morrie.
4,COMFORT FOOD FOR THE SOUL,"This book is very well written ... the author aims right for the soul and hits his target! Not an exciting, dramatic read, but ideal for the mood I was in when I read it. Mitch Alborn aroused feelings of peace and well-being. I highly recommend it.Betty Dravis is the author of THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY, just released in April 2005, and of MILLENNIUM BABE: THE PROPHECY."
1,Boring and ridiculous,I listened to it on tape and I couldn't believe that there had been so much hype about this book. I thought it was completely contrived and ridiculous. BORING
1,Don't Bother,"This is the worst book I have read all year. I was really excited to get the book, but as I started to read it I found the plot very weak and the characters shallow. If this book were any longer I would have thrown it out. I still can't figure out what people see in this book. The message is obvious after the first person you meet in heaven. Furthermore, the message is nothing that has not been said in a hundred other (and far better) books...or films for that matter (think It's a Wonderful Life)"
1,A True Letdown,"I thoroughly enjoyed Tuesdays With Morrie, and was looking forward to reading this book. I was totally disappointed with the entire experience. The anticipation was greater than the event, unfortunately."
1,On heaven...,"If heaven turns out to be how Mr. Albom describes it, definitely I don't want to go to heaven. I've had many thoughts on what heaven can be, but never crossed the thought that I would have to reach heaven to fill myself with more regrets and guilts than those I left this life with. I have the conviction that we must try to become the best out of ourselves in this life, that we truly should be committed to this; but to reach heaven to meet people I never met in this life and be filled with remorse and guilt exceeds all my expectations.Having read ""Tuesdays with Morrie"", which is definitely an inspiration of love and a 'must read' to everyone, ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"" is a most discouraging one."
3,Meh,"Maybe it's just because this style of book isn't really my thing, but my main thought on finishing it was basically a big shrug. It was pleasant: an easy, fast read -- I finished the entire thing in the bookstore -- and it makes you think, albeit briefly, about how interconnected we are and what kind of life you're living. I liked the somewhat unusual structure (beginning with the main character's death), but aside from that it was mostly quite predictable.It reminded me a lot of a Hollywood feel-good comedy, actually: not too challenging, and you come out feeling vaguely touched and thoughtful. There aren't many deep points or new ideas in there. That's totally fine if you're in that mood -- I've watched many such movies and read many such books in my time -- but if you want more, you'll be disappointed."
4,A book that helps to put life into perspective without preaching,"This is the story of a man's life described after he dies from the perspective of five people who influenced or were influenced by him. It is presented in a way that keeps the reader on the edge because unpredictable information may be presented by each one of the characters.I cannot say that it is a book full of crucial lessons about life or a book of self development. However, it is a good story told in a very original way. I enjoyed reading this book."
2,The five people you meet in heaven,"This book really was not too good for me. I was actually very disappointed. While I love Mr. Albom's writing, this was just too elementary for me. I feel like it would be great for pre-teens etc. The story was very slow and I never connected with the main character. If you haven't already, skip this one and read Tuesdays with Morrie, it is wonderful."
2,Poorly written yet good story,"I liked the main idea about meeting five people, how they all had crossed path with Eddie somewhere, the idea that all the stories are connected and has different sides to each of them, and the lessons each of them gave. I get what the author wanted to write about.HOWEVER, the writing style just plain annoyed me. I didn't think it was necessary to repeat the same style over and over for five times with Eddie's birthday and the lesson chapters. These could have been all put together to make it a smoother reading.I watched the movie and the movie was EXCELLENT. There was none of the extra annoying repetitious of Eddie's Birthday chapters nor separate lesson chapters. It flowed really nicely (even though, it's pretty long).I would suggest that you watch the movie since it covers the entire book in a much smoother way. Also, for some reasons, reading the book was more depressing. Instead, the movie uplifted me."
4,"Different, but good","The book definitely was not what I was expecting. I guess I had it in my head that there was more of a religious bent to it, with more involvement of God in the grand scheme of things. Even though the storyline differed from my expectations, however, it is still an absolutely captivating read. Albom does a fantastic job of showing us his interpretation of heaven, including how our lives may interact with others of which we are not even aware.So...if you are only looking for a book that touts Christian values and the Christian view of heaven, you may be a bit disappointed. If, on the other hand, you are just looking for a good book to read that does still touch on the concept of God and heaven, this is it!"
5,just amazing.,"Amazing, that's just about all I can say about this book. Although I wasn't a fan of Tuesday's With Morrie I decided to try this novel after hearing several other people sing it's prasies.This book is a quick, feel good read that will have you laughing, crying and rooting for Eddie by page 2. Don't question yourself, just read it, it's that good. I have yet to come across someone who HASN'T liked it!"
2,boring,"I didn't care for this book at all. I found it to be nothing more than whimsical daydreaming. The whole idea was rather immature. Older, more sophisticated readers probably won't get much out of it."
2,Not That Great...,I was very disappointed with this book. I was under the impression I was about to read something insightful and thought provoking....too bad this book is neither. I recommend skipping this one unless you enjoy wasting your time.
2,Sappy Fluff!,"The comparisons to A Christmas Carol are true, but Dickens' book is superior. The reviews that this book is preachy are accurate as well. Think Celestine Prophecy. I thought that this would be a nice light interesting read with some substance. True, this is a light read that will take less than a couple of hours of your time. False, there is no substance to this book and your time is worth more than this."
4,Give it a shot,"First of all, I think that Mitch Albom really meant this book to be more ""food for thought"" than something to be taken literally. Hence some of the other reviewer's disappointment. Yes, he probably did try and make us cry and manipulate us to an extent, but then he's an author--that what they do! Forget the hype surrounding this book and the ""other"" Mitch Albom book and read it for what it is: a sweet, short, heart-warming little piece of fiction. And I'm not sure I agree with some of the other reviews that this is reminiscent of ""Christmas Carol"" as it is totally different. Would also recommend another wonderful read: Jackson McCrae's THE BARK OF THE DOGWOOD. While nothing like THE FIVE PEOPLE, it is worth checking out."
4,Enjoyable Book,"This book had a lot of good story lines and some very strong and interesting characters. I loved the way their lives intertwined with each other. I would recommend this book to anyone, ""sophisticated"" or not!"
4,Good Read,"This book was a good read for sure. Makes you think about who ""your"" five people will be that you meet in heaven. Great price as well...bought because it was Amazon's daily book deal. However, I would love it if Amazon offered book lending to people that own an iPad. I pay for ""prime"", so I feel I should get all the perks even though I don't own a Kindle."
3,5 People,Short read but entertaining. I kind of liked the way it flowed between present and past. Takes a while to get into the book but if you stick with it you will eventually get through.
4,The five people,I read this book in one day. it is hard to put down at times. simple and to the point
4,Five People...,"This was a very nice read, very well written; an interesting premise, very thought provoking; I sat up late to finish it. If you belong to a book club, this would be an excellent choice to read & discuss."
2,Maybe I'm not spiritual,"This book is a nice little book, I guess . After reading it, I just do not understand how it is so popular. One of the customer reviewers even used the term, life changing. It certainly isn't heavy in insights. I suspect those who are moved by the book are very easily moved by simple little books.I agree with the reviewer who said a reader's time can be better spent on many other books."
2,No surprises,"I don't want to say this was a BAD book - just that it exactly met and did not exceed my expectations. I expected that Eddie would meet some people he knew were important in his life and some people whose importance would be revealed to him. Yep. I expected that he would try to resolve some of the parts of his life that were difficult for him. Yep. I expected that it would have some sort of a ""happy"" ending (quotes are because he did die, after all). Yep.Well - I guess there was one unexpected aspect of it. I expected to care more about Eddie and his life - but I didn't.BUT most people that I have talked to including the person who gave it to me thought it was very moving and fabulous - so maybe there is something wrong with me.At least it was short."
3,It's OK,"It was an interesting read, I found that I really wasn't impressed by the book. This book reminded me of the book What Dreams May Come, which I felt was a much better work."
2,Too sad to be uplifting.,"The last sentence of this story summarizes the author's point and purpose beautifully: that all our lives and stories are connected, and everything has a purpose, however unseen or realized. BUT, I truly disliked this book!! I felt the 'point' was so poorly executed. The stories that unfolded were so sad and unnecessarily tragic that I was distanced and disturbed instead of connected and heart-warmed. The hero's life might have not been a waste, technically, but if he was too unhappy to realize the beauty in it, then the story is a tragedy in my opinion. I was expecting something uplifting, and couldn't have been more disappointed."
5,a must read,"This is a great story of a man that died and the people he met along his journey to the afterlife, who were individuals that he crossed paths with during his physical life, and reviews his physical lifetime as well. Incredibley moving."
2,Not as anticipated,I was deeply disappointed in this book. I have read more meaningful books that costs much less than this one. The only way I would encourage someone to read it is if they get it for free.
3,Expectations were too high for this book,I had heard so many great reviews about this book but was slightly disappointed after reading it. It's very short and easy to read but it was also very depressing.
2,Not nearly as wonderful as Morrie!,"I was disappointed by this book because it felt so fake compared to Tuesdays with Morrie. I guess that story, being true, might have been easier to write, but I wanted more from this one."
3,"A little hokey, but pretty good!",I was a little dubious about Albom doing a novel after Morrie. Tuesdays w/M was a real favorite of mine and while this doesn't live up to the expectations one might have it still is a touching story. It'll make a good gift for any sentimental members of your family this Christmas.
3,Just Okay,There was a lot of hype over this book but when I read it I was a bit disappointed. There is a lot of hidden meaning between the lines but the story was kind of boring. The author attempts to define what his interpertation of what heaven will be like when we pass on but I feel he really falls short in keeping the reader interested. I do give the story 3 stars because there were moments that did make you think about what your own impact is on people around you while you are living.The story is okay but nothing earth shattering!!!
3,~ Five People You Meet in Heaven review ~,"After reading the Five People You Meet in Heaven it made me ponder what Heaven is really like. Its fun to think about who the people I'd meet if Mitch Albom's portrayed version of Heaven is accurate. Over all this novel was entertaining and somewhat thrilling at times. Even though this book was overall a well written story with several intense scenes, I had trouble staying interested throughout my entire time reading the story. In general I believe this novel is somewhat overrated and didn't keep me at the edge of my seat, wondering what might happen next; hence only three stars. Overall the Five People You Meet in Heaven is a novel that lifted my spirits and left me content in my thoughts."
5,Five People You Meet in Heaven-Could a book get any better?,"The Five People You Meet in Heaven was a very touching story. This was my favorite book ever. It is a great book for the young and old. The movie is also great,too! I must warn you though it is very emotional and can be sad at times so you might want a box of tissues! Overall, the best!"
2,Like a chocolate souffle,"Well, if you just want to entertain yourself for a couple of hours, this will do it. Nothing profound here. A lot like ""Who Moved My Cheese"" or ""The Present."""
1,Not for intelligent readers.,"Sorry, but this is the sappiest, most insipid book I've read in a long time (and I read 50 books a year). So simplistic in the way it spoon-feeds you emotion after trite emotion. Save your money and buy a dozen cupcakes...you'll get nearly as much sugar."
1,Unbelievable,"This is one of the truly DUMBEST books I've ever read. Are there really that many people in the world to whom it never occurred that their lives impact others, and that that impact goes on and on, like ripples in a pond?I tend not to be much on best sellers, but after having several people tell me what a powerful book this is, figured it might be the exception that makes the rule. Wrong-o.Save your money and your time. Use it to do some good in the world."
1,Blah,The quality of writing in this novel is sophomoric and it shows in the dialogue and the descriptive text. Might be a good simple read for children but there are much better novels for adult consumption.
5,thought provoking,i loved this book and will read it again and again. it reads like a true story that you cant help but become completely absorbed in.
3,"Not very profound, but OK nonethteless","The idea itself is novel: meeting five people whose lives in some ways, whether you know it or not, were related to yours. The book is extremely easy to read (and I am saying this as someone whose first language is not English). At times, the author changes his style of writing to a high school teacher-like style; way too much clarification for the obvious. Not much of a challenge for the brain!"
4,The Five People You Meet In Heaven,"The Five People You Meet In Heaven was a wonderful book. This book was a book about a man who thought his life was worthless. He worked at an amusement park. Eddie would walk around the park, making sure that all of the carts were secure on the rides. One day, this day being his last birthday, Eddie was killed by saving a girl's life from a falling cart. Eddie went to heaven. In heaven he met five people, that changed his life. This book makes you think about making an impact on other people's lives. The Five People You Meet In Heaven was a touching book."
4,Good reading in a short format,"I read this book in an afternoon. I enjoyed it a lot. It made you think about our role here in life, our reason for being, and how we impact others...quite insightful. I grew up in a town a few blocks from an amusement pier, so for me, the descriptions of that brought back memories. Good character development. If you lost a husband or wife lately, you may find some comfort in this book."
3,disappointing,"Saw this on a list of must reads......by some celebrity who now escapes my memory....... It's far from being compelling much less a ""must read""."
5,The five people you meet in heaven,One of the best books I've ever read. I'm normally only interested in books regarding the military but this story is beautiful.
3,AN INTERESTING STORY,"The story was well written, believeable and interesting and the ending was very well done. However I felt the book was sad and dismal. It was not uplifting and not at all enlightening as the title might lead one to imagine."
3,Fair,I have read a number of books by people who have had an experience with heaven. I found this one difficult to finish.
4,Touching story,"This is a quick read--think I read it in 2 days. Heartwarming and touching story of how every life touches another and how each person, no matter how insignificant they may feel, makes a difference in the life of another."
4,A deep reading that causes you to reflect on your life.,"Mitch Albom is an incredible writer. I had trouble getting into this book at first, but as I read on, I could see how he was relating circumstances in his character's life is no different than the events in our own life which can impact other people's lives, both positive and negative."
1,Simply Dreadful,"This book was given to me as a gift. It's so poorly written, I couldn't help wondering what the publisher was thinking. Made to appear as another ""Tuesdays with Morrie"", Albom sinks into a 5th grade writting style with a Christmas Carol theme. It's preachy, phony, sappy and tries to appeal to the emotions of the Oprah crowd. A dreadful money grab and not even worth the deep discounts offered here. Avoid this book as it piles up on the floors of your local Kmart."
3,Pleasant but average read,"This book is an easy and nice read in that it celebrates the 'life of the ordinary man'. It's lightweight and appropriate inflight material. Other than that, the book is way overrated."
2,this idea was new in the 80's,"the good news is, it's an easy read. if you've done little or no spiritual work, this book will be a revelation and uplifting. if you're a bit beyond that, it's trite and not that interesting, sorry!"
1,The New Jonathan Livingston Seagull,"Hallmark greeting card sentiments litter this book, posing as philosophical profundities. Why would anyone want to believe that heaven exists as some kind of therapeutic analysis meant to explain your earthly existence. What is the point? You're dead already! Albom fuses a little Buddhist Karma philsophy with Jewish mysticism to create this banal concept of heaven. I sure hope I don't end up there!"
2,Huh.,"Huh. Interesting but... not all there. I must say I was intriuged by this book's plot. It could have gone a long way, but Albom did not take it to its full potential. Its rather tired morals and clichéd dialogue put a weight on the otherwise airy pace, scenes of near-rape and death bed repentance seem out of place in the book's almost whimsical narration. Airplane reading."
2,Five People Who Bore You In Heaven,"Reading the NY Bestsellers List can sometimes lead you to books that sound interesting but turn out to be a complete waste of time. The idea was an interesting one; you die, you meet five people who teach you wonderful insights on your life that you overlooked while you were on earth. However, that would work much better had the main character led a corrupt life in the corporate world or had actually overlooked something in his life (which would have been cliche but much more believable). This was not the case in this book. Eddie seemed to be a man who had some ghosts in his past but overall was a very loved man and a led a very quiet life. This made the lessons he learned almost seem redundant. To top it off, the writing was very poor. It wasn't much of a page turner and at many points, it was very predictable and bland. If you really want to learn some life lessons that enlighten you, pick up his other book, ""Tuesdays With Morrie."""
3,Not the Best Map of Heaven,"For a light reminder of life's spiritual mirror, The Five People You Meet in Heaven represents a great introduction into the world of spirituality, and life after death, and how our lives all have a purpose. When you are ready to go deeper, read the near-death, purpose stories by Betty Eadie (embraced by the light)or Tiffany Snow (psychic gifts). These highlight the deeper Spiritual things, and a look into heaven itself.Indulge yourself! Continue on the path to be a higher intelligence in the universe! The world needs it, doesn't it?"
5,"IF THIS IS LIFE AFTER DEATH, THEN LORD I AM READY.","AFTER READING THIS BOOK, I AM HOPING TO HAVE THE SAME EXPERIENCE AS EDDIE, THE MAIN CHARACTER, DID. IF THIS IS LIFE AFTER DEATH THEN LORD I AM OKAY WITH DEATH. WHAT A GREAT STORY THIS WAS. SO HEARTWARMING AND A BOOK I COULDN'T PUT DOWN. IT WAS AS COMFORTING AS IT WAS EXCITING. I COULDN'T WAIT TO GET TO EACH OF THE FIVE PEOPLE HE MET IN HEAVEN.THIS BOOK WAS A VERY EASY READ AND IT IS DEFFINATELY ONE OF MY FAVORITES."
2,"At times moving, but ...","The first person he met is questionable. Didn't really see the point. The last person he met ... the author was definitely trying to make it come together, but IT TOTATALLY DOES NOT WORK; IT WAS FORCED, AND SO 'FAKE'. If Eddie (the protagonist) is traveling through 5 different pockets of heaven, where each soul creates what they want to share with Eddie, then why doesn't the Asian girl speak better English? She's old enough to speak well. Why does she have to speak in broken English? She is in heaven now. Anything is possible in heaven, even good communication. Overall, the book is a quick read. I finished it in 2 hours. It does make you think and value your days on earth. Of course, don't think too hard about the book and the author's choices or else you'll start seeing holes; big holes which may put a damper on that sense of feeling good after a sweet paperback."
4,I enjoyed it,"I enjoyed this book very much. Well written and easy to understand. I didn't give it 5 stars because of a war-like scene i prefered not to read because i was almost bored, but apart from that it was a great read."
5,Amazing,"This was an amazing story that put a spin on the idea of Heaven. As an agnostic person, I found joy in entertaining Albom's idea of Heaven."
2,"Very depressing, NOT really something you should read","This book has a great title, but the story is based on a man who has a life that he really did not want and then dies goes to heaven and finds out who's lives he touched in a good and bad way. This book inspired me in the sense that I really do NOT want to be like that man so let me do the very best I can, if I don't like a job, I will change as soon as possible, opposite of the point the book wants to make. The book makes the point that the man hated his job but stayed anyway blessed a lot of kids or people, but hated his life! I can't understand other reviewers I really can't.Buy life's Golden ticket, so much more inspirational. Also I need to say that this is my first negative review.If you are an other reviewers and want to explain to me with respect why it is a very good book please do.Keep on reading."
1,Unhappy with lack of response & product,I ordered 3 books at the same time. Two were received. This one was not. I was supposed to have it a week ago. I sent an email. No response. No book.
2,to say this book is a waste of time is a kindness,"To say this book is a waste of time is a kindness! It was off the mark, barely cohesive. It was badly strung together and certainly not worthy of the author who wrote Tuesdays with Morrie."
1,yech,"The publisher review above cautiously uses the terms ""saccharine"" and ""preachy"", and tries to make it sound like the book prevails in spite of meeting these descriptions. They are good descriptors for it. Mitch Albom must have sold this soap mainly on the merits of Tuesdays With Morrie. If you're looking for the likes of Tuesdays with Morrie, don't bother. If you like saccharine, go for it."
4,"""The greatest gift God can give you: to understand what happened in your life.""","If libraries were candy stores, this novel would be in the ooey, gooey, sickly sweet aisle. It's the kind of book that satisfies your sweet tooth but won't exactly nourish your literary mind. Yet at less than 200 pages, the indulgence won't kill. In fact, you may walk away from it spiritually enriched thanks to the words of solace it provides. If each of us could self-design our own afterlife, I think we'd all have a little bit of ""The Five People You Meet in Heaven"" in it. Go ahead. Dare to overlook the hype and the syrupy coating and savor the nuggets of inspiration this book delivers."
1,disappointed,"I am returning this necklace. The silver is so bright that it looks fake, and the CZ settings are klunky, not delicate the way it appeared in the photo."
2,Not Happy upon recieving,"The product arrived with the side of case locked. The key was inside the case in an unreachable area. I had to remove all the outside drive coverings to gain access, and then I was just barely able to cut the box with a bent hangar to have items fall to a reachable area inside. This is not the reason why I ordered one day shipping. Who was the genius in the company that decided to lock the key inside the case?!"
4,Another excellent Antec product,I have assembled several Sonata's and like the ease of access to the inside of the computer. It makes it easy to clean once a year and change batteries.Peter A. Statti MD
3,Nice case,Nice case overall for those building a machine that won't product to much heat.Problem was that my case never came with the parts bag. You can't mount the hard drives without special screws that go through the rubber hard drive grommets. Returning a case to amazon just isn't going to work. So trying to get the parts missing from Antec has been a chore and a half. Their support is well... there isn't any. You can't ever get a hold of anyone in customer care. Their online ticketing system is horrible and manned by obvious drones or those that simply can't read English.Antec is great if you never have a problem. But the very millisecond you need any kind of support just forget it.I knocked two stars off just for that.Note - I can order the parts bag for $8.00. Something that weighs maybe a qtr pound if that - $10 to ship via USPS. Definitely not impressed. Next time I need a power supply or case - will look elsewhere first before looking at ANTEC.
3,The old Version of the case was better,"I bought my first sonata case 2 years ago and love it. This new one is ok, but not as nice as the old models. The case finishing is lousy, has an orange peel texture instead of a smooth finish like the old cases. The rubber feet came off when I pulled it out from under my desk (cheap glue instead of being screwed or plugged into the case. The door that covers the drives feels cheap and flimsy. I get the feeling antec has moved their production to the lowest bidder for their cases now.There is a fan switch for the rear fan of this case with a low med and high setting, however there is no where on the back of the case for the switch to fit and be accessible, I have it hanging out of an extra lan port on the rear plate.On the plus side the case still has rubber mounting for all the drives and the fans are very quiet."
3,Not bad but not great,"My Sonata III 500 arrived with a broken door. It looks like Antec will replace it, but I'm really disappointed with the quality. I had never ordered a name-brand case before and I was expecting something better than a generic. Well, this is a little better but not worth twice the cost of your usual case. The entire front including the external drive door is plastic and quite cheap. The internal layout is good and roomy with easy access to everything, adequate cables on the PS, no real problems. Sound level is good but not astonishing.Added: Three days now since I sent Antec my amazon receipt and they have yet to confirm that they'll replace the broken door. Meanwhile, the fan I ordered from amazon for this same case is 5 days late coming. Running a PC build through amazon won't work as a just-in-time process if everything is late or broken."
4,Great case with a free power source,"All around great case, I didn't use the power source becuase the wattage was too low for my needs. With the 120mm interally mounted fan you will run into issues with really long video cards like the 8800ultra or GTX."
3,Antec ATX Case,Pros: Included quality PSU. Sturdy case.Cons: No USB 3.0. 5.25in plastic bays pop out too easy. Tight fit with ATX.
2,Grounding Issue,"Mine had a grounding issue which apparently has been solved. I contacted Antec- they sent me the middle piece (formerly chrome, now black), no instructions, no information. Ridiculous. I bought a NZXT, problem solved."
5,Great case!,This case is great to work with. It has a clean design and good documentation. It is also very quiet as promised.
4,Nice case,"Pros: Very quiet. High quality, seems sturdy, easy to load the drives. Love the all black look. Power supply is good and 500 Watts.Cons: Plastic door seems a little flimsy. Also the front USB, firewire and audio ports are kind of difficult to use, I mean that you really need to push the usb plug into the outlet and it scratches the cord's metal, same with headphones they are a little difficult to push into the front port.Other than that it is a nice sturdy case. I got it on sale for 80$ and am very happy with the deal."
5,Go to case for quality and quiet,"What can I say, this is the case I always come back to. I have built computers with the Sonata I, Sonata II, and the Sonata III and I have loved everyone of them. The case is beautiful and the inside is functional and is quiet by design. The shiny black can be a little annoying because of fingerprints, I would prefer a matte black but it does look good when it's all shiny and clean. A really nice case, so nice that I have reused mine and just update the internals (mobo, memory, etc) even after 6 years."
4,"Nice polished design, but some noise","I've had the case for 4 months now. The 120mm fan that comes with it is a bit loud when put on maximum speed, although I think I got used to it by now and don't notice it. The case does have space for another 120mm fan on the front and with a quiet fan, could be quieter. Another annoyance is that there are quite a few power cables inside, which is nice, however, getting them out of the way is a little tricky (using one of the drive bays for them is one possibility). The front door is a nice touch and the panel with 2 USB ports and a SATA port are quite convenient.Altogether, the case is well made and polished. The somewhat noisy fan and the internal clumsiness with the power cables are the only reasons it gets 4 stars."
5,"Gate Valve, Go Figure...","Its a gate valve! Pretty cheap and works as it should. The handle is RED just like all other gate valves, for whatever reason the pictures are grayscale."
5,And to think....,"New condition as ordered, fast service, shipping was a little pricey though! 5 year old wanted this book since she missed the days they reviewed this book in K and thought it would be good. Now its one of her favorites!"
5,great rhyming book for toddlers,The book came in great condition.I love the story itself. It's a great rhyming book for my little one.
3,And to think that I remembered it,"I have memories of loving this book. And I do still enjoy it. But perhaps it isn't as appropriate for my son. There are aspects of the book that have not aged well. The authoritarian father who represses the imagination and the 'chinaman eating with sticks' are from another time. I don't feel entirely comfortable reading this book to my son. That said, the wonderful flow of ideas and imagination is still a joy to me. I wish to be walking on Mulberry Street on most days.H-"
4,Telling the truth,"This book spotlights the line between imagination and deception. An imaginative boy thinks outlandish thoughts and even considers telling them as the truth. Just before I read the last page to my children (ages 5, 3, and 1), I asked them what they thought Marco would tell his father. My children gave sincere thought to the question and one of them decided that he would tell them the imagined story and not the real one. They were delighted with the ending and when asked to tell me three things about the book, they responded that the book was about ""telling the truth"".Despite the wholesomeness of the ending, the book is filled with fun that is so typical of Dr. Seuss. It gives a nudge toward thinking outside of the box and making the most of your surroundings. My girls were smiling and intently listening from start to finish."
4,Not one of his early readers :),"This is a classic Seuss book - strange, wild, rhyming. Marco is obliged to tell his father what he saw every day. But all he's seen today is a horse and wagon. (Ah, timeshift. If I saw a horse and wagon on the street it really WOULD be worth talking about!) So he changes a detail or two, and in a one-person version of telephone goes dashing up the stairs to tell his dad all about the BIG BAND and PLANES and ELEPHANTS he saw.Hilarious :)I will note that there's a mention of a ""Chinese man who eats with sticks"". While I don't think that line would make it into any book printed nowadays, I don't think it's actually racist, though if you're concerned you should read this book before you buy it."
1,Disappointed,This spatula broke the first time I used it; the plastic snapped while I was scraping down the sides of a bowl. I would recommend silicone spatulas made by Orka and Trudeau.
1,This is NOT 5.5lb density!,"I have bought 100's of items from amazon over the years, this is my first review; THAT is how disappointed I am with this product.I bought this thinking it was a 5.5lb density memory foam mattress. This is definitely NOT the case. It is more like 2lbs per foot dense. A queen size 4"" topper is 80"" x 60"" x 4"", thus it is 19,200 Cubic inches. To convert that into feet, divide that figure by 1,728 (12x12x12) = 11.11111 Cubic feet of foam. SO, at 5.5 lbs per cubic feet, this topper should way over 60 pounds. But, shipped, with box and cover, this weighs in at a scant 24 pounds!For someone looking for a low density memory foam topper, this may be the one. But, for those of us that think the 5.5 used in the advertisement of this topper refers to the density of the foam, they will probably be disappointed."
4,"Good for the price, but not Tempur-Pedic quality","I bought this overlay in the hope of improving the limited number of hours I get to sleep each night. For the price it is a great deal (it cost about 10% of what an actual Tempur-Pedic overlay would). The foam itself is not quite what I expected; It does not ""melt"" in response to body heat nearly as much as the tempur foam. That being said, I am very happy with it. The 4"" thickness is a lot, which is great for comfort, but can be a problem when it comes to sheets (it made the bed like 50% thicker). Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone needing improved sleep who (like me) does not have $1000 to spend on a mattress pad. It's like I have a whole new bed! And it is so, so comfy!"
3,"Nice, but not as advertised","I'm sure that this will come across as slight to some, but after a 24 hour grace period to let the pad expand, it was only 3.5 inches in thickness. I'm not returning the product, but if you are debating on purchasing this item then keep it in mind."
2,All over the place,"There's an awful lot of drama and detail and a huge amount of self absorption in this book.It holds one's attention the way ""reality"" tv does.I can't recommend it though as I don't feel the character got any wiser nor do I feel at all enriched from reading it.If one assumes this is fiction it might make more sense though the story is still all over the place.I feel it's best that one at least look at the possibility that this book isn't strictly true. It might save one resentment later.Salon has written a good article on Castaneda's work that speaks to this question.It's here: [...]"
3,Good if you have read Castenada,"If this was the first book I picked up and read on the subject of Sorcery, Toltecs or such I would be lost as far as getting any real meaning out of it. I think it best to read Castenada and Sanchez first."
1,Fictional,"Donner is supposdly one of Castanada's ""inner circle disciples"" that has dropped out of the public eye. This book is just a continuation of the Castanada myths. This is a difficult book to take serious, unless your new and naive to Castanada's writing and are still entralled by the myths. Donner's book is just another typical Castanada story with a slightly different twist to it, in order to sound original and credible. This technique has worked well for a whole slew of parasitic writers that re-write the basic Castanada themes and present them as original and make a ton of money off the gullible. She is just another parasite ripping off Carlos Castanada devotees."
2,Weakness,"The weakness of this book is the author's stereotyping the role of the book's characters and culture. The strength of the book is the excellent style and grammar in the writing. I don't rate a book on style and grammar alone. The content basically lacks existential meaning.However the author does stab at how one can get others to submit to being controlled. For example, the controller claiming they have supernatural power like reading the other persons mind, getting the submissive to identify with a type of thinking that says, ""if that is true then this must be true"" when the two have little or no correlation, and the age old control technique of ""give up self"" to gain super powers. Control also is shown in the insecurity and anxiety of the relationships.Unless you only want to witness good grammar, I don't recommend this book."
4,Excellent!,"I loved this book. It not only was a marvelous story, it actually helped me immensly with my dreaming. I told my boyfriend to read it, too, and he did. He did not get as much from the book as I did. I think because a woman wrote this, it made more sense to me (as far as ""dreaming"" is concerned) than it did to him. But never the less, I loved the book and I want to read it again. Thank you Florinda, for sharing your experiences with us! Valerie"
4,...,"Not the most interesting in the series, this book was not a page turner, but still decent. It would have been much appreciated to have some character developement. Say, Drizzt saying ""Cattie-brie, I love you, Wulgar, go to hell, you stupid idiot"" (wahahaha). I also think that Artemis should come back, but not as the evil Kill-Drizzt maniac, but rather as a character with some real personality.Considering Salvatore has managed to write so many books about one character and still keep his readers entertained is amazing. Even more amazing, is no matter how much I tell myself, Drizzt is one of those ""perfect"" characters I usually don't like (never makes a mistake fighting, too honorable to admit his love, and most important, he is brought up in an evil environment, and is somehow kind??) he still manages to be one of my favorite fantasy ever characters ever!! The book is still worth the read, and if I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars, rather than just 3 or 4."
2,Not one of Salvatore's finest,"I didn't care for this story at all. The story moved very slowly and the characters were very shallow. I kept waiting for the story to pick up, and was sorely disappointed when the predictable end came. The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1 is that Salvatore introduced a Dwarf cleric and I was impressed with this new character. Drizz't fans all over will be disappointed."
2,what a dissapointment,"I've been a big fan of the entire series since I read the dark elf trilogy. It was so good that I even showed the book to some friends who also share the same enthusiasm about the series. Since then, I have read all of the Drizzit books (even the ones without him). I've found that only the first 7 (and the Entreri book) are fantastic. The rest much like this one are 50% garbage. I dont like Catterbrie, despite the fact that she has all of the great weapons she stinks. She is extremely annoying and I hope they kill her off. I also find her relationship with Drizzit ludicrous. Wulfgar was only cool when he was a bad ... barbarian instead of a loser with emotional problems, he should have stayed in the abyss. Regis was funny, now he's just annoying. Drizzit should go back to being a loner, its what he good at. He's become to soft hanging around the rest of the crew, they hold back his true potential."
4,Keeping Drizzt and the gang going...,"Is this the best of the Drizzt series? No. Is it the worst? No. It sits somewhere in the middle ground of the series. If you're a long time fan I definitely recommend this book. If you haven't through Faerun this isn't the best place to start, try the first of the original series."
2,Cool Cover Mr. S.,"I purchased the Thousand Orcs when it first came out with the notion of reading it one day because the cover was so cool. That's how I pictured Drizzt. Spoiler alert: That scene was not in the book - 1 star. I've read just about all Salvatore's dark elf series and I'm a fan, but I found the book wanting. The entire book appeared to be nothing but several short stories about characters I don't really care about, other than Drizzt's core group. At the end it comes together, but it seemed forced. The jumping around to the various other groups was jarring and didn't add anything to the story. I feel that the author missed a golden opportunity to make this a mystery. Why are the orcs rampaging, why are the giants helping them, are the drow involved? I was expecting a lot more from the story and the author. But hey...the cover was cool."
5,Best Book I've ever read!!,"This book has ACTION!!! in the first couple of paragraphs, its extremly interesting, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The characters are AWESOME!!!. This was my very first Forgotten Realms title and now Im hooked. The Author didn't bore me with exstensive descriptions of a person, place, or thing. It got straight to the point and kept me reading. I can hardly wait to read the sequel. #1 Author....R.A. Salvatore."
4,Call it 9/11 in Faerun,"It was evident from the start, with all the talk of death in Drizzt's musings between sections that Salvatore was dwelling upon and drawing from the terrorist attacks in the US last year. It became more apparent as the story reached its climax and the decription of mutilated bodies, loss of friends and ultimately the collapse of a wizard tower that 9/11 was exactly what Salvatore was using as his inpiration for this novel.I didn't dislike the book, it though I wonder why all the these characters have such a hard time coming to terms with their own feelings. Drizzt speaks about living in the present yet he is too frightened to even speak his thoughts to the woman he loves. Build a bridge; get over it. Either kill her or let them get married.I believe that Salvatore is trying to breath life into Drizzt the same way the death of Chewbacca reanimated Han Solo. Lets hope it works, though unless a certain mortally wounded character ends up dying, this probably won't happen."
1,Terrible Beginning to a New Series,"Salvatore has lost it.RAS used to be one of the most enthralling authors in the Fantasy genre. Now he's stale, rehashes old plots, has no substance to his characters, and nobody can die.It's really quite tragic."
2,Predictable Prose,RA Salvatore's writing is very pedestrian in style and seems more like a play by play commentary of some D&D game than anything resembling a novel. This book is only recommended for 14 year old fanboys who judge a book's quality by the numbers of magic items carried by the heroes.
4,thousand orcs,"while not being the most exciting book salvatore has written, the thousand orcs is still pretty good. I enjoyed it alot. It does start out slow, but it is the first book of a 3 book series. It lays down the scene for future events. It is just like any other first of a multiply book/movie set. Look at star wars a new hope...pretty boring...robert jordans' wheel of time...book 1, pretty boring...This book had enough action and plot to keep me reading. I would suggest this book"
3,The Thousand Orc,This new installment by R.A. Salvator brings everything you would expect from a book by a master writer. We have an intrictly writen plot invovlong many sub-groups. We have the return of Wolfgar to the fold. Emerging from the black bile of his past and becoming a more mature and thoughtfull pillar of the group. Tension runs high especially concerning the pending decisions about exactly how far Drizzit and Cattie-brie are going to take their love for each other. And the question that arise from that contemplation brings about some serious racial and longevity issues to their lives. Bruenoer is back in beautiful form stomppin around and killing orcs while he tries to deal with his feelins concerning his pending coronation and future life as King of Mithril Hall and subsequent lack of adventuring. oops gotta go butyou get the gist. Its a wonderful read trust me.
5,Obould is Gruumsh!,"The book that started up the Hunter's Blades Trilogy! A perfectly good RA Salvatore novel for any Fantasy Fan. Drizzt Do'Urden shows what he really has in this book, by battling Orcs and Frost Giants alike. A great Prologue of the brandnew series that still isn't finished. If you liked this book, get The Lone Drow and see how the story continues."
4,The thousand orcs,This story was pretty good there is a lot of description and has a good story line. There is a lot of action so I would recommend it to a person that likes action books. This book is fiction and I like how the story is about some dwarfs. The enemy is orcs and ice giants who I like to read about. If you like to read about mythical creatures that kill stuff then I recommend it. I think this is about four stars to me because when I read it I got kind of side tracked and not as interested in it. Nikilwig is a pretty interesting character that is heading to Mithral hall. On the way there they encounter lots of monsters then get into lots of fights which I like to read about. This is my review of The Thousand orcs.
4,Different From the Rest,"One of the things most people don't realize about the Hunter's Blades Trilogy is that it's written according to the Third Edition D&D rules, whereas the previous ones were all 2nd Edition.The author's transition is pretty smooth. But don't expect it to be as exciting as his previous works.I definitely liked his writing style in the old 2nd edition better. Although 3rd edition captures a lot more stuff and is a lot more realistic and detailed, I could tell that when writing this book, Salvatore was suffering from inexperience with the new ruleset.The story is not THAT interesting. Don't expect to be turning pages in great anticipation.But, it's Drizzt, the best-woven character in Forgotten Realms after Elminster. I think the second and third books in this trilogy have the potential to be much much better than many of his previous books, and the first one only opened the door for this."
1,WARNING!!! Horrible Book,"This book was Salvatore at his worst. Do not buy it. It was really boring until the end and then all Drizzt does is fight a few frost giants. After this Drizzt goes into a berserk rage that lasts for another whole book because he thought that Bruenor died. This attempt to build up tension turns Drizzt into a bloodthirsty instinctive monster for another whole book. All he thinks about is kill orcs, kill orcs, kill orcs."
5,Pure Brilliance,The Thousand Orcs by R.A. Salvatore is the first book in the Hunter's Blade trilogy. It was my first read by this author and I absolutely loved it! Very Tolkien-Esque writing with lots of action and tons of adventure! Character development is also used in top notch in this novel. The cover art tells of the excellence that this book trully is! A must read for any Action/Adventure/Fantasy book fan! I will definetly read more from R.A. Salvatore.
5,could not put it down,This book was fast action the whole way. The best part about it is Orc king Obould who is becoming one of R.A. Salvators most deadly villians. I recomend this book greatly. However for new readers it would be a good idea to read some back books to catch up to the story.
4,Very rich and thick,"The product distraction says ""All-natural ingredients ."" I am not sure abut the . ""Mono & Diglycerides"" that make up the ingredients. I chose this product based on it being more natural than other products. While it is not perfect, it is much more natural than other products. The taste is wonderful. I would rather worry about the extra caleries instead of the effects of the additives put into other products."
2,HFCS,"The fact that this has both HFCS and regular corn syrup, along with sugar is a bit disgusting. You can tell HFCS leaves a nasty film all over the inside of your mouth. Pretty much ruins it for me."
3,"good, but not the best","I ordered a case of 6, first try of this brand. Starbuck's carmel sauce is $4.95 in their store, so I am looking for cheaper option that is at least as good as their product. While I don't have regrets, the sauce is good and I will use it all, I will be looking for a better product for my next purchase.Side by side comparison with the Starbucks sauce, the torani is not as thick, not as rich or buttery. Looking at the labels, the ingredients are almost identical between the two products, but the starbucks mix had butter as a much greater portion of the mix, and torani included high fructose corn syrup as a prevalent component.Note: not sure why its labeled with Mocha, there isn't any cocoa as part of the product."
4,Good for use with the Cafe Frappe,"We bought this to use with our newly purchasedMr. Coffee BVMC-FM1 20-Ounce Frappe Maker. It works great for caramel frappes. It tastes pretty good, though it's not quite as good as the stuff that Starbucks uses. However, for the cost for a case of 6 of them, I think it was worth it."
4,Patience required but rewards a subtle payoff,"Sometimes, when scrolling through the endless wasteland of horror movies and refusing to sit through another tv-ready cast of teenagers snarking and shrieking at cliche-X, you take a gamble on something you've never heard of and get lucky. Sure, the whole film strains under its low-budget but this seems to be a case where the filmmakers chose to compensate for these shortcomings by focusing on pacing and a subtle narrative; I actually feel the film was at its weakest when mimicking some been-there done-that imagery. What you end up with is a creepy little story told with almost no dialog that centers around a *gasp* elderly man living alone in the woods.Certainly, this isn't for everyone - Transformers and Hostel babies will no doubt be texting within minutes - but patient horror fans will find something to like here."
5,Soft for Digigng into Madness,"That the protagonist of this extraordinary independent film is elderly, alone and isolated turns out to be a dividing point for viewers who want to see nubile teens mutilated ad nauseum. Director J. T. Petty knew what he wanted to do even in college when he made this film. It's what hardcore connoisseurs of horror look for: respectful of the genre, well-made (within a rigorously limited budget) and surprising. Emerging from a noir sensibility, it's a unique and worthwhile contribution."
1,You have to be kidding...,"The only conclusion I can come to is that the other reviewers here are friends and relatives of the director, because this stupid amateurish movie is like a bad student film, and I can't believe I actually spent money on it. The cheesey special effects are just thrown in senselessly (a little dead girl jerking and spasming around everwhere) because the director has seen this particular thing in about a hundred other horror films from the last decade and obviously liked it. Ridiculous."
1,No CD as ordered,"When I ordered the book ,I ordered the CD with it but when the book came there wasn't a CD included that I paid for.I would like a CD mailed to me. Thank you."
3,"Sparse, it's not","For Whom the Bell Tolls, is equally very engaging and very dull. Occasionally this novel cracks with energy, the tension among the characters is quite potent, and then at other times it bores you near sleep. The rambling monolgues can be great(like when Pilar is detailing Pablo's once fervent commitment to the cause) and then at other times the words seem to be an annoying roadblock that you have to wade through to get to the meaty parts. All in all I respect this novel and do think it is a good work, but I can't give it more than 3 stars, because of the chores it sometimes put me through."
4,Damn good book,"This book was excellent. My room mate advised me to read it saying that it was the greatest book about the Spanish civil war ever. I know nothing abot the Spanish Civil war so I cannot comment on that. The only part of this book was that Hemingway wrote it. Not to knock Hemingway but knowing that his characters always die was not a comfort. I found myself routing for Robert Jordan through the whole book. It was like the last play of the Super Bowl. the way he had everything going wrong, but then at the end his mission goes through with full force. I've never really read Hemingway in all my life, but if I had to chose one of his books I would have chosen this one. The way he depicts the Spanish is all but wholesome, describes them more like cavemen, literally. There are many witty parts of this book that can only be funny during war. For anyone who is a history buff or wants to know what real war is like I advise them to read this, and pass it on to someone else."
4,A Problem Of Pendulous Americana Amongst Noble People,"Laurie Lee told me that he had met Ernest Hemingway. Whether or not it was during the Spanish Civil War or not, I don't recall. What I remember most is his acidulous critique of the blundering All-American dolt who thinks he is the only one who can sort it out...He remembered great Paul Robeson, who will always be remembered( -I take it that many correspondents already take me as black.) Robeson was a great follower in battle, a great propagandist, and therefore a great warrior.Lee railed , in his inimical Gloucestershire, about 'The Big Cowboy' who thought he could lead these tender men to battle. He was kind, to the point of sheer tenderness, about Hemingway as a supporter of the people's great struggle, but he always saw him as impossibly arrogant, (I think), as a forerunner of today's all too cowboyish thickhead, who could I be thinking of?"
5,Good read,War is ugly and this story could just as easily be placed in Afganistan . The love scenes between Robert and Maria were very moving.
5,For Whom the Bell Tolls is a great book by a great author.,"Hemingway changed literature. He was that significant. And even though he has been brushed aside, or assaulted, by literary history, he has not been forgotten by those who write and found their seminal inspiration in his work. For me, reading In Our Time was a life changing event. When I later picked up For Whom the Bell Tolls, the scenery, imagery, characters, situation, sense of place was so vividly drawn, painted, portrayed, that I could describe it decades later.... It is as if I have been there. The setting is Spain, during the Spanish Civil War. You have many very fine reviews here that can tell you about the story itself. I simply felt impelled to assert that I could identify with this story in some way that I did not relate to The Sun Also Rises. I've read this one twice and In Our Time three to five times.... and will undoubtedly read them again. Enjoy!"
3,disappointing,"Hemingway falls short with FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS. The writing is suprisingly clumsy, and the characters contrivances. (Incidentally, why do Hemingway's heroes alway want their women to cut their hair ""like boys,"" as Jordan wants his lover to in TOLLS??? In at least one Hemingway short story, the female lover cuts her hair like a boy to please her man; in THE GARDEN OF EDEN both women cut their hair like boys to please the man; in A FAREWELL TO ARMS, Catherine Barkely cuts her hair like a boy to please Frederick Henry. What's the deal??? One could make some rather interesting conclusions about Hemingway himself while pondering this recurring detail in his work!!!) Anway, about TOLLS, F. Scott Fitzgerald said it had ""all the profundity of REBECCA"" (a famously sleight novel). I think Fitzgerald sums TOLLS up well."
4,It's what's not said,"Great ending...left to the imagination of the reader. Hemmingway does that a lot in this book. Lays down a scene, but does not complete it. Lets the reader imagine how it plays out.Very accessible book. Puts the reader into the scenes with excellent, very detailed descriptions. And the characters are human...not perfect...not overdone.Quick summary: An American spanish teacher from Montana is engaged to contribute to the Spanish civil war effort by bombing a bridge. He recruits a randy band of freedom fighters who are hiding out in a cave to assist. In the four days leading up to the bombing, he makes friends, makes enemies, falls in love, and eventually gets the job done, even though in the end he's not sure how he's contributing to the cause."
1,"If you're smart, you'll toll the bell on this novel!",I guess the simple truths of Ernest Hemmingway were just a bit too simple for me.
1,"Tepid, Macho, Romantic *Crap*","Simply put, this book, and Hemmingway in general, is overrated. There is nothing unexpected in the prose nor storyline, just a typical page-turner or ""best seller"" -- and that is *not* a compliment! Lacking in any real insight and imagination, Hemmingway is more like a modern-day Stephen King or Amy Tan or any other writer who sells their soul for the sake of popularity."
1,for whom the bell tolls,"the book is censored ! not original text , should be removed, and replaced with the un-edited original version. why are altered books being sold ?"
2,For Whom the Bell Tolls. by Ernest Hemingway.,"The book is very wordy with lengthy sentences that are are unnecessary for continuity of the plot. Even taking exception for the fact that it is taking place during war, I find that it is quite brutal. I do not find it enjoyable."
3,Is this a edited version?,"Not really a review, but hoping readers of this book can clarify. I'm reading the Kindle edition and note that the word ""unprintable"" and ""obscenity"" are written in place of well, swear words. Is this Hemingway? Or am I reading an edited version of the book? I'd prefer not to read an edited book. I can't seem to find an answer to this question online. Anyone know the answer? (Kindle user can do a search on ""obscenity"" and ""unprintable"" to call up what I'm talking about.) Thanks in advance for any clarity on this."
3,"Sorry, but not so great","On the back cover of this paperback it's noted that Hemingway is known for his ""terse"" sentences. Did the person writing this ""blurb"" read the book? Probably not. In parts of this novel the author writes as if possessed by James Joyce, in a stream of consciousness style with long sentences. That's OK, or would be, if they added to the novel but, sorry, they don't. The author is also repetitive, repeating the same point over and over in some cases. But there is no reason in terms of the plot in writing the same point over and over in this book except to (in my opinion) stretch this novella out into almost 500 pages. The first couple and the last couple of chapters are essentially where the action is. One has to ask why this story is so revered and I think the answer is because the author was so admired. The press especially hero-worshiped Hemingway and perhaps this explains the too-much praise for this work. Still, not a bad book and when it's good, it's very good."
2,Let Down,"F. Scott Fitzgerald himself said of this novel: ""It has all the profundity of REBECCA."" REBECCA being a sleight novel. This book reads like a 2nd-rate journalist's attempt at writing a novel. It lacks the subtlety of Hemingway's other novels. I love Hemingway. But I didn't love this book."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be.,"I was excited to read my first Hemmingway book. I labored through the extremely cumbersome and boring narratives hoping that eventually it would pay off, unfortunately it never did. I know it's fiction and everything but the way Hemmingway has Pilar describe past events for pages and pages is very unrealistic. The book finally gets good about 34 Chapters into it whith the raid on El Sordo's band which is the highlight of the book. Maria is annoying. The narrative is confusing. If you are looking for a classic I recommend skipping this book. I plan on reading ""The Old Man and the Sea"" next. Hopefully Hemmingway will redeem himself in that book. I honestly do not see why people consider this a classic. It was a waste of time."
2,Not too impressed.,"I listened to this on audio book over several days, it felt like forever. I wasn't too impressed. It was slow, slow, and did I mention slow. Then when it was interesting, it wasn't even worth all the slowness. Won't be sampling Hemingway again anytime soon."
1,the emperor has no clothes,"Someone has to say it, the supposed emperor has no clothes. hemingway was known to be a legend in his own mind and apparently attracted a cult following. for me, this book was a terrible disappointment; i feel cheated by the author's reputation, which seems undeserved. it's sad if the arbiters of quality in American literature view Hemingway as some kind of icon. i voraciously read more books than i can ever count, starting out as a literature major in college and now it's 40 years later. for whom the bell tolls is mind numbing for the most part with a plot that barely moves, does not stimulate the imagination, and makes a rather ordinary point overall. the dialog is mostly rather odd, shallow and unrevealing. Except for the character of Pilar, who vividly and viscerally recounts instances of the brutality of man against man (and woman and animal, especially during con flict, the other characters are not well developed. I cannot recommend this book at all."
5,The best,"This book has had more of an effect on me than any other I have ever read. It is deep in imagery and in meaning. If anyone is to ever read a book, this is the one. But be careful ,young children, the ideas presented may be too difficult for you to grasp. Recommended for experienced humans! You'll go nuts at the end!"
3,Say it a thousand times,"This is the second Hemingway book I've read, the first being Farewell to Arms. This book is about 200 pages too long. There are some wonderful bits washed out by blinding repetitiveness. Over and over again Robert Jordan talks in circles around his head, Pilar nags and curses, Maria and Robert compete to see who can proclaim their love the best. Say it right once, clear, simple and powerful. Do not say it a thousand times so your words are an echo of an echo of an echo."
3,"Slow, but good and artful","The author's style is strong and detailed, but with so little happening over so many pages, I found myself becoming impatient with the story. Perhaps just a sign of the times and my own personal taste, I put the book down after reading only half of it. In reflection, the characters, the settings and the building of the story line are all quite beautiful as a whole, but the pace was just too stretched out for me to endure. Perhaps I'll pick it up again sometime."
4,Hemingway's definitive novel,"I wanted to re-visit the work that established Hemingway's reputation, dated though it obviously is. Certainly his unique use of the English language and dialog as narrative still astounds. It's also a thoroughly good read, if a little sentimental by today's standards (whatever they are). He was that most entertaining of writers - a great story teller, telling stories of what he knew ( write about what you know, and not before you know it, was always his advice to anyone wanting to write).I can't give it 5 stars, so much that is good has happened to the novel since then, but of its time, it is timeless."
4,Straight Hemingway,"For Whom the Bell Tolls is a Hemingway less affected by his modernist tendencies than To Have and Have Not yet not as uninfluenced as The Old Man and the Sea. Also, there is a good deal of sexual discussion and activity, though all of it is done in an explicit-yet-entirely-implied manner exclusive to Hemingway's style. This story of the American professor who joins the Spanish Communists in their fight against the fascists explores love, morality, Communism, duty, awareness of death, and bravery in the face of death. Specifically, impending doom expedites and deepens the life and love of the characters. A good first read but not necessarily worth a return."
5,Wonderful. A real treasure.,"Hemingway's masterpiece is one of those books that makes you feel as though your life will change just from reading it. A master of style, Hemingway constructed his clean prose as though he was writing a simple translation of Spanish poetry. Indeed, the author has skillfully crafted a story that reads as through a filter of that Romantic language, and the result is stunning. You will not be prepared for the tears you will cry upon finishing this story."
2,not his best,"Hemingway wrote many good things, but this isn't one of them. The title refers to a poem by John Donne, in which the poet seems to suggest that the tribulations of any humans are the business of others as well. Hemingway has applied this notion to the Spanish Civil War, of which he was a first-hand witness. The plight of the Spaniards here should be the concern of all of us. The problem is, his point is clearly made by the title, and the rest of the book does nothing to improve upon it. This long tome about rebels trying to blow up a bridge ends poorly; the characters don't arouse too much sympathy, and the whole thing goes nowhere, except where the fine title has already taken it."
2,Plodding plotting,"I entered this book thinking highly of Hemingway, having read some of the Nick Adams stories as well as The Old Man and the Sea. But Bell is quite a disappointment. The 1930s-era characters seem to be speaking an off-putting and unwieldy gringo Shakespeare (""Thou hast crossed the arroyo, Ingles""). Moreover, the revolving themes of duty and honor and the instrument of war / administration vs. the individuals who carry out the specific deeds don't seem to develop. Rather, the reader is subject to endless conversations with rather boring people, then Robert Jordan muses in an unenlightening manner upon the conversations he's had. About 1/3 of the way through the book I was thinking ""just blow the damn bridge up, make love to Maria, and go home."" Having skimmed the Cliffs Notes, apparently it takes a few hundred more pages for that to happen; pages I am unwilling to read."
2,Boring Hemingway I'm upset,"I love Hemingway, but this book bored me to tears. I'll concede that I watched the movie first and knowing the ending took some of the fun out of it. Go read A Moveable Feast. You can always come back to this one later."
1,Hatred for changes,"I do enjoy the book. My issue is not with the book but with the people who altered it to suit their sensibility. If you don't like the langauge used in the book that is fine, but don't change every curse word to ""unprintable"", ""unmentionable"" because you and want you and your children to live in a bubble. You are ruining something that is perfect as it is. You lack the creative ability to create anything on your own so you believe changing curse words into clever terms makes you an artist. Whoever edited this book need be shot, and be sent back to whatever community college academic standpoint they came from where they believe the world is fair and things should all be politically correct.NEVER CHANGE THINGS TO SUIT YOUR SENSIBILITY!"
3,Oft tedious tome---,"I love almost all of Hemingway's novels, but this one was a daunting effort. Line by line, or a paragraph at a time, the writing is Hemingway at his best. Yet, inexplicably, I found that as one chapter segued interminably to the next, the story and style became muddled and could not sustain my interest. There is much, however, that is worth the time...themes of monogamous love, war/conscience, life/death. The heart wrenching finale illustrates the notorious he-man's mastery to convey softer, ""feminine"" sensitivity. Definitely not the one to kick off a reader's Hemingway exposure."
4,Motivations and consequences of war,"In the most obvious sense, this book did a fine job of outlining a historical situation that, until I read this, was unknown to me. On a broader level, it was a compelling characterization of both the horrors and romance of war. It also blatantly reveals the heavy toll that responsibility and power have on an individual. This is a classic because Hemingway was able to enthrall the reader with intense detail."
5,Great book,"A major portion of the novel is told through the thoughts of Robert Jordan, with flashbacks to meetings with Russians in Madrid, and some reflections on his father and grandfather. Jordon's inner monologues fascinate and clearly demonstrate Hemingway's skill with language and character development. Jordan, at one point comments to himself, that he is his own best companion. Because of his wartime responsibilities, he cannot allow himself to be overcome by emotion, which he considers a luxury. Whenever he feels anger, deep love, disappointment, foreboding, fear, anything that will distract him from his purpose, he talks himself down and refocuses. In such a relatively brief period, he begins to love life as never before, because of his feelings for Maria. Even here, however, he accepts that if anything happens to him, he is fortunate to have experienced a lifetime in three and a half days."
4,profiles in courage,"in for whom the bell tolls hemingway looks at war from the individuals perspective. his army is a rag tag group of guerrilla fighters, not the army. the time and setting is the spanish civil war. a general understanding of that war is helpful. the characters include mostly local insurgents and one american mercenary. the horrors of war are portrayed on both sides with neither having the higher moral ground.it is also a study of courage in the face of potential death. this is developed not only through the underlying theme of war, but the stories of some of the characters earlier lives which include bull fighting and the running of the bulls.the one drawback to the book is the stilted language used in the dialog of the novel (including the refusal to use obscenities).a book well worth the read"
4,A powerful novel...,"Hemingway used his experiences as a journalist during the Spanish Civil War to build the structure for this novel. His descriptions of the settings are superb. The novel is a great introduction to the Spanish Civil War, a war with which many Americans are unfamiliar. Hemingway used characters like Pablo to show how people lose their humanity during war. The story is powerful. His main character, Robert Jordan, begins to question whether anything good will come of all the fighting.Despite its many wonderful attributes, this novel has some problems. The dialogue is stilted. The romance (as in all Hemingway novels) is unbelievable. Finally, Hemingway should have stuck to English. His use of Spanish in this book is embarassing.Nonetheless, in my opinion, For Whom the Bell Tolls should be required reading for all U.S. high school students. It's truly a classic."
3,What War Is Really Like,"With vivid, descriptive prose, Hemingway takes us into the mind of a soldier. Focused on duty and his mission, our main character encounters love among the carnage, but even that does not sway him from his duty. Though at times a bit long-winded, Hemingway brings the internal battle of war to the surface. The self-talk that goes on shows the conflict behind the rough exterior. We also see the useless deaths that take place because of the uncertainties that come with war."
5,Enthralling,"This was the first book by Hemmingway that I ever read. I was enthralled at his style of writing and development of character. He has a very plain, honest manner of stating the reality that is overlooked either intentionally or unintentionally. For Whom The Bell Tolls is a book to be read and remembered."
4,A good novel,"I happen to think Hemingway is one of the most overrated novelists of the 20th century, but this particular book is ""a good read."" Hemingway does deal with many subjects such as duty, brutalization, love, or loyalty, all the while telling a good, moving story. Not my vote for ""the great American novel"", but worth reading."
2,Censored,"If you want to read an award-winning author's works, do not read this edition. It is censored to remove the profanity by usning the words ""unprintable"" repeatedly. Very insulting to any reader. If young people can't handle such vocabulary, they should stick with ""The Adventures of Barney."""
2,"I Obscenity In The Milk Of....Aw, Muck It.","The plot, characters, etc. have all been discussed ad infinitum around here. Let's just say I was looking forward to my first Hemingway book. It took me three months to get through it. I'll read another one, but if it's anything like this one, maybe Ernie isn't for me."
2,A Bit Slow For Me,I want to offer a little dissent here. I thought the book to be a bit dull and slow. I really labored to get through it and becuase of it completely turned me off to the rest of his work. It could be that I spend too much time reading action fiction so I need a fast paced book to keep me interested.
5,Jordan is a Romantic in a Romantic movement.,"For Whom the Bell Tolls is the story of an American teacher who feels compelled to join the leftist cause during the Spanish Civil War. At the moment when the world was beginning it's plunge into cynicism (where it remains) Hemingway creates a Romantic hero in the world's last great Romantic movement. Jordan is very human and very real. He believes in the cause for which he fights even though he suspects his side may well lose the struggle. Pablo and Pilar are memorable characters. Pablo has let fear get the better of him. Pilar is one of the strongest women in 20th century literature. Hemingway takes all to a satisfying destination. This work is a must read for all those who believe that one should not struggle for anything which will not benefit the self. Jordan went to Spain to fight an evil, powerful and unjust force. He believed the world COULD be changed for the better."
3,Different,Lustbader is a very creative author with an enormous capacity of Fantasy..you are nurtured here with many forces that takes you to a different level of reading a novel.Is interesting and it works to read it..Is different than the previous I read from him.In fact you have to read an author in order to know him.This book has been another step and side in his way of writing.
4,Required Reading,I had to purchase this book to read for school. It is interesting to see the history of what was taking place around the time our Constitution was adopted and the politics at work during that time. This gives context to the study of our Constitution.
4,The Federalist Papers,"I was not sure what my purchase would look like, but I am pleased with it. I have not read all of it, but I find it informing. I am concerned about the lack of respect in our government for the Constitution and Declaration of Independence. It occurred to me that I was ignorant of value of these documents myself, so I am trying to correct that. I am glad that Amazon was there for me to order easily."
1,Utterly appalling.,I could never buy from a publisher who puts warning labels on our nation's founding documents. May they go out of business very soon!!
5,first reads!!!,this book gives the best insight into our founding fathers first writings on changing the minds of colonialist to make that bold step into this wounderful democractic republic we live in today.A must have for your consrvative library.This book is a great read and a great reference book to the pre constitution.
2,Mistake or Bait & Switch?,"I wanted the Federalist Papers, edited by Clinton Rossiter. Found it in a paperback edition (Signet Classics) on the Amazon website. Amazon price, $7.95. Not bad, but the same web page lists Kindle Edition for $0.99. Trouble is, the Kindle edition is not the same edition! The Kindle edition is The Federalist Papers, all right, but with a different editor and from a different publisher.This is either an honest mistake because Amazon can't differentiate between editions of works in the public domain, or it is a bait & switch, where you think you are getting a particular edition of a text but you receive something different on your Kindle.Luckily, it only requires a couple keyclicks to return a Kindle book. Now I can go buy the paperback edition at Powell's.As this was my first purchase for my new Kindle Paperwhite, we are not off to a great start!"
5,A great bookhelping explain the Framers and the Constitution,"This is history - of our USA - that I needed to help complete the picture of our Founding as a country. The Federalist Papers is a great addition to any and every historical library, and a must for patriotic Americans who want to further their understanding of ""who we are""."
5,"I love this ""product""....as millions do.","Once again : It's a classic. Part of the founding concepts of a Great Country. There is little to add except to say : Thanks Amazon for having it for free and, yes, as many friend say and I thought and (only sometimes) think: paper is paper. But...tons of paper is too much in many senses. The ""hinge"" is just under my feet : paper vs e-paper. I'm affraid, in practical terms, the ""hinge"" is clear at my stern.Before sleeping, the book of choice (since my PaperWhite is at home) is....the Kindle."
1,BOYCOTT WILDER PUBLISHING,"This publisher thought the need to put a WARNING LABEL on the CONSTITUTION of the UNITED STATES, as well as other federal documents of this time, which I personally feel is NOT in the best interest of this country and this WARNING LABEL had no purpose. This company wanted to DISTANCE itself from the protections it provides. SO BE IT! I will make an effort to NOT purchase anything published by this company EVER, no matter if it means that I miss reading from a favorite author. I will be researching if any of my favorite authors have books published by them, and writing emails to them to voice my concerns to them also!"
1,Disgusting,This is disturbing. This is an obvious example of the joke that has become the United States of America. This is the begining of the end of our Constitution and our Country. When will AMERICAN Citizens open their eyes and see what is happening?????? I will definitely boycott all produts from this publisher.
1,Disgusting Disclaimer!,"I will NOT buy a copy from this publisher - who feels the need to apologize for the contents of this great work!!What a disgusting disclaimer - That the founding documents of our Country do ""not reflect the same values as it would if it were writtten today?"" Which values would THAT be?Our Founding Documents are what made this country the most free, most prosperous, most desirable (don't see a lot of people trying to sneak IN to Mexico, Cuba, Russia, China, North Korea, do you?)country in the world, and they apologize for them???!!!!I will carefully check for their name on anything I buy - and make sure I buy from someone else!Maybe the publishers should set up shop somewhere that ""reflects"" their own values better than the United States of America. I wish them luck with that!Hypocrites!"
1,Garbage,Liberals hate america. They're preachings will poison the youths of this nation through the use of The Federalist Papers. Avoid this book at all costs and boycott the company for making an unbiased warped view of our nation.
1,Kindle edition? Don't bother,"The Kindle edition is very disappointing - it only contains the papers, and (at least on the iPhone Kindle reader) does not even contain a table of contents, links, or the fine introduction of the paperback. Get the paperback and don't bother with the Kindle edition -- apparently, Kindle has a lot of growing up to do."
2,"Great material, horrid typeface","I will not even comment on the material itself, other than to say that it is superb. However, the print quality is so poor as to merit only two stars. It is much worse than ""newsprint,"" on roughly 20 pages of my copy, over a quarter of the page is virtually unreadable, the text is so light. The only reason this book merited two stars was its superb notes, illuminating some of the more perplexing aspects of the book. However, I would not recommend this particular copy unless found at a bookstore (sorry, Amazon) where the quality of the print can be evaluated."
4,Important Reading for Americans.,"If you're American these papers are important reading. They were drafted by three important historical figures during the forming of the original 13 states. These papers were drawn up in order to encourage other states to join the Union. After the drafting of the Constitution of the United States in 1787, only Delaware, Pennsylvania and New Jersey had joined. These papers appeared in New York journal's and were impassioned pleas for other states to join the Union. I am Canadian, but I read these papers with great interest. The majority of them were written by Alexander Hamilton, and he is an impassioned and charismatic writer. Good history lesson here."
5,Indispensible,"If the educational system were functioning as it was intended, no student would be denied six semesters of studies in these papers. Here lie the thoughts of our founders before they were penned into law. To deny a future electorate access to such knowledge is to deny them the concepts which ensure their liberty"
5,Superb historical document,"Getting into the minds of and historical significance of our founding documents through our founders writings is the best way we can understand that our constitution is not exactly a ""Living"" document."
5,Rationale for a Constitutional Government,"If you want to have a better understanding of how and why the U. S. Constitution was written, this is the book. It takes you back to that time and gives you the perspective of the writers."
5,understanding the supreme court,To better understand the perspective of supreme court justices one must get a sense of the history of our constitution. We often hear politicians and justices talk of the intentions of the founding fathers. We hear terms like strict constructionalist or origionalist. The Federalist Papers are a good place to look at the intentions of the founding fathers. These along with readings on Jefferson and Madison will help to clear up this often muddled picture. The Federalist Papers were an effort by Hamilton and Jay to educate the voting public so the Constitution would be ratified. It was a controversial document. It was in the documents need to satisfy a diversity of ideas that its excellence was achieved. Any voting citizen of the US should understand this aspect of our history as it is fundemental to our future as a democracy.
4,A good timely read,"Reading the Federalist Papers at a time of impeachment hearings, trails, and sound bites can give you the insight into how the Founding Fathers attempted to ""sell"" or ""spin"" the need for a Federal government to the contemporaries.Reading it will also allow you to see through all of the pundits and politicians who profess to be following the founders intent and quote Madison and Hamilton but have never realy bothered to actually read their words."
1,Hamilton would blush,To put the nations most important thinking in such a cheesy cover is a real shame. It would embarass the authors. But alas the Papers are the Papers. They are an explosion of Enlightenment thinking and can thus enhance and enliven anyones understanding of the nation's founding and nations' many current predicaments.
2,Pro-corporate,"""Federal"", as in ""federation"" and ""league"", relates to commercial entities and commercial contract. Keep in mind, the United States is not a country but a corporation with no jurisdiction outside it's ""ten mile square"" district and the 18 enumerated functions of Congress Assembled (aka The United States)."
1,It's the POLLS Stupid!,"I have no idea why anyone would waste time and money on a book about the Constitution. The Constitution doesn't amount to a hill of beans! If you can move the polls, that's all that counts. Save your money on this one folks and learn how to spin!"
4,The Federalist Papers,"Great historical document by founders Hamilton,Madison, & Jay. Should be requited reading in every Classroom."
5,The Foundation of an Unique Government,"The Federalist Papers are rightly considered one of the most authoritative explanations of the provisions of the Constitution in existence. While much further interpretation and definition of the Constitution has taken place over the past 200+ years through the slow accretion of judicial interpretation, the Federalist remains the source for a contemporary explanation of the political causes and justification for virtually every clause in the Constitution.Some passages are less thrilling than others but Nos. 10, 39, 48, and 51 are about as good as it gets in terms of explicating the structure of what became the US government.A must read for political science majors, history majors and selected parts for high school students in every government course."
1,Usefule Idiots,"The publisher of this work somehow feels the need to place a warning label with it. What is so harmful or potetially harmful in the Constitution of the United States of America? Kruschev said the communists would destroy us without ever firing a shot and Lenin spoke of useful idiots. In my humble opinion, guaranteed the light of day by the Consititution, these people are who Kruschev and Lenin spoke of back in the day. Boycott all of their publications. There are plenty of places to buy copies of the Constitution without supporting an apologist, revisionist, propogandist publishing company."
1,PC at it's worse,"Placing a disclaimer on the Federalist Papers is unbelievable. It's their right of course, but it's our right to protest and to NOT BUY.Thank you."
1,Unbelievable Orwelians,"I will boycott any product of this company. Their disclaimer is outrageous, ludicrous and malicious. We the people must put them out of business."
4,A stripped down edition the The Federalist Papers,"Given my inexorably advancing age, my eyes are not what they used to be. I therefore welcome this version of ""The Federalist Papers"" in that while not a ""large print"" edition, the print IS larger and easier to read than elsewhere.The book is of good quality and I expect it to last at least as long as me. The only reason I gave this edition four stars instead of five is that there is absolutely NO commentary. Many may declare this a feature and not a bug. However, new as I am to the actual text of these famous essays, a little guidance (if only a simple introduction) may have been helpful.That said, there is endless commentary available from other sources including readily accessible material on the internet so this really isn't a problem.I wanted a quality, hard copy edition of these essays and I got it.Enjoy."
2,Federalist Papers first copy.,"This is the book I ordered. However the binding was bad in that the pages would fall out of the book. I returned it and requested another copy. The replacement copy had the same problem. I seperated out all of the pages, got a three-ring binder, punched holes in the loose pages and inserted them into the binder. Works great."
5,Federalist Papers in paperback,"The paperback book looks like new; never cracked open. No pencil marks, smudges or any sign of use. It looked like ""new in box"" without the box! The description was accurate and I am pleased with the purchase!"
2,Not For Study Use,"This edition of the Federalist Papers lacks margin and header space for notes. Additionally, the typeface is small and lines too close together to make easy to read--I had to use a ruler to track my reading.Don't buy this edition if your goal is to use it for study!"
4,Into the minds of our founders,The Federalist Papers is like getting a rare glance into the minds of our founding fathers and their reasoning for the adoption of the U.S. Constitution. Each article is carefully argued and thoughtfully presented. It's the real deal.
1,"Kindle edition November, 27, 2010. A rip-off.","The format in a Kindle DX is awful, unreadable. Lines of different lengths, with one or two words, words broken at random points... Don't waste your money on this, it is just a pity that Kindle users do not get the respect they deserve. Buy this on paper or do not buy it at all."
1,The publisher trashed this great work.,The publishers should be ashamed of themselves... the publishers truly are America hatersfor trashing this great work via disclaimer.
1,BOYCOTT WILDER PUBLICATIONS,"WILDER PUBLICATIONS YOU FEEL THE CONTENTS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND THE DECLERATION OF INDEPENDENCE MAY BE OFFENSIVE WELL I FIND YOUR STANCE ON THIS OFFENSIVE AND WILL NEVER PURCHASE ANYTHING PUBLISHED BY YOUR COMPANY, FURTHERMORE I WILL EMAIL EVERYBODY I KNOW INFORMING THEM OF YOUR DECISION TO PUT WARNING LABELS ON THE CONSTITUTION AND THE DECLERATION OF INDEPENDENCE. THE NERVE OF YOUR COMPANY TELLING THE PUBLIC THAT THESE DOCUMENTS MIGHT BE OFFENSIVE!!!"
5,Required Reading for All American's,"Read this and understand the true thoughts and meaning behind the Constitution and its Amendments, its interesting to read how the founding fathers interpreted what they wrote in a very different way then the courts and federal gestapo interprete them today. Especially of interest is the paper oon the true meaning of the term ""for the general welfare"" which has been used to allow all sorts of power grabs from the nuts in Washington, and which has been interpreted completly contrary to what the founding fathers intended. Be a true patriot, read this book."
2,Beware the library binding,"I was looking for a high-quality gift book for a big fan of the Constitution. What I got was a small-format (basic Penguin trade paperback) book crammed with small-font text, small margins, already-yellowing paper and an austere red binding with no jacket. All for a premium price.Look for another, less expensive version. Any other version."
4,The Federalst Papers,I love reading the intent and purpose of our Constitutons framers. It provides great insight. The way this version is laid out is excellent and easy to follow. I would highly reccomend it to others who are not professional researchers.
3,Difficult Reading - from Amazon Purchase,Of course this is written in the language of another time. Very longwinded and difficult to follow the thinking. It just comes from a different era.Was told it would help me understand the Constitution. Wish me luck.Of course I bought the book at Amazon.
2,table of contents poor,"Table of contents is just a list of the paper numbers, no titles. Nor can you actually get to the TOC other than ""go to beginning""."
1,Shame on Wilder Publishing,I am appalled that a publishing company would put such a ridiculous disclaimer on a publication of the founding documents of the United States of America. Buy from another publisher.
2,Better in our forefathers time,Thought it would be interesting to read what our forefathers wrote that got this nation started. Too wordy in an archaic way for me to continue past the first few pages.
1,A Disclaimer??? Get real Wilder...,"Wilder, may you crash and burn at the earliest possible convenience. You disgust me with your trashing of the documents of our Founding Fathers. GFY.Sincerely,TGW"
4,Includes Table of Contents,"This free Kindle edition of The Federalist (with Jay's name listed first in the Amazon listing) has one advantage over the other edition available free at this time (for which Amazon lists Madison as first author). This (Jay) edition has a table of contents at the beginning so you can jump directly to the paper you want to read. The text seems clean, though the headings seem disproportionately large. That small quibble aside, it seems perfectly adequate for quick reference."
1,DISGUSTING BOYCOTT LANGUAGE!!!,"'Nuff said. There are other publishers who publish our Constitution, Declaration of Independence, aFederalist Papers, and other documents that form the basis of our country and the free world!!! I will NEVER buy anything from Wilder again, and will tell everybody I know why!"
1,"Check the publisher before you buy, the reviews associated with the Books LLC publication are from another version","There are different versions of this book available, and somehow Books LLC has managed to get the reviews associated with a better quality imprint associated with their book. BE WARNED. Books LLC is a wing of a company called VDM Publishing which, among other things, specialises in automated scanning in of copyright-free books, they print these cheaply, with no editing, no checking the text, there own website says there may be missing pages and they do no manual checking, there's no table of contents. Etc. The Books LLC version is basically VERY low quality.Check carefully what you're buying or you may end up with a book that surprises you. If you have been taken in and ended up with one of these books from ""Books LLC"", Amazon will take Returns within 30 days (check there Returns Policy first....)."
2,This is wanna be death row material.,"This Album was put together by Ms. Lydia Harris, the wife of michael harry-o harris who claims he funded death row records. Interesting cd."
5,An excellent documentary on the black women's lives,"This book does an excellent job of documenting the lives of African American women from slavery to the 20th century. It gives a portrayal of their strong abilities to move forward, their religious faith, and their degree of hope and self-pride in the meantime. I sincerely recommend this book to everyone in hopes that it will serve as a guide in their present lives."
3,Good tub... bad lifespan.,My toddler will only take baths in this tub....which is fine. Having to buy it now for a THIRD time due to holes developing is not fine.
3,Tub has strong plastic smell,"I couldn't find anywhere--not on amazon nor on the product or its packaging--what this tub is made of, but I suspect it might be made of PVC. It has a strong new-shower-curtain/new-pool-toy smell when you first open it, and I let it air out for a few days before using it. The smell is gone now, but I would have loved it if this tub were made of a less smelly (and probably more eco-friendly) material.Also, the tub doesn't fit directly under the faucet--half the water goes in the inflatable tub, and half of it goes between the inflatable tub and the side of the bathtub. I fill a large plastic bowl with water and dump it into the tub to fill the tub.Other than these issues, the tub is ok. The size is good and it does the job."
5,Bath time is fun again!,"I used to love giving my daughter a bath when she was a newborn...it was so easy! Then as she started to become mobile, it was a little less fun - for me anyway! I got this tub when she was about 4 months old and I haven't looked back (she's now 14 months). It's SO much easier to wash her hair since she has something soft to lean back on. I'm also a bit paranoid about germs and it makes me feel more comfortable that she's in a tub that only she uses (vs. the whole family). It's wonderful to take on trips (especially to hotels...yuk), but just remember to bring a hand pump. Also, we're having a water shortage now in GA and this uses so much less water than filling the whole bathtub. Can't say enough about this product!"
4,A great concept,The Snug-Tub is great because you don't have to fill up the bath tub. My 7 month old loves it. The only concern I have is that she is very active in the tub and the bottom is quite slippery. I must have my hand on her at all times. So what we do now is I place the bath seat in the Snug Tub and let her play. When she is all done I take the seat out and rinse her off in the Snug Tub.
2,Great.....for a short while,"We bought this tub 3 months ago for our 6 month old daughter. It was great until it developed a slow leak on a seam. We would just have to re-inflate it a bit before each use, but now it won't even make it through one bath. Since it had only been 3 months, I called Amazon to see if they would replace it. Amazon told me I needed to contact the manufacturer, Kelgard. When I contacted them I was told to contact Amazon. So bottom line is no one seems to want to send us a replacement. It is great until it leaks. Is sure seems like we should have gotten more than 3 months use from it!"
1,Bathtub is made of vinyl -- leaches chemicals!,"This bath tub is a great idea, but it's made of vinyl, which makes it unsafe for babies & children. Vinyl leaches chemicals into the air which are very dangerous to humans, esp. babies & children. Ever smell that ""new shower curtain"" smell (you know the one) its a result of chemical off-gassing, releasing phthalates in your home. Phthalates cause endocrine disruption, are linked to asthma,and have developmental and reproductive effects.If you are buying this thinking it offers a safer bath environment for your child, think again!"
2,Great....for a short while,"We bought this tub 3 months ago for our 6 month old daughter. It was great until it developed a slow leak on a seam. We would just have to re-inflate it a bit before each use, but now it won't even make it through one bath. Since it had only been 3 months, I called Amazon to see if they would replace it. Amazon told me I needed to contact the manufacturer, Kelgard. When I contacted them I was told to contact Amazon. So bottom line is that no one seems to want to talk about replacing it for us. It is great until it leaks. Is sure seems like we should have gotten more than 3 months use from it!"
2,Dangerous Tub!,"I like the idea behind this tub--the size, the inflatable sides and bottom to cushion baby, the suction cup to attach it to the adult tub and the generous drain are all good features. However, the bottom is so slippery that after one try, I was afraid to use it again! Even though I never take my eyes, nor hands for that matter, off of my son while in the tub, he still slipped all over in this one. You are supposed to be able to lay them back to wash their hair, but he just slipped right down into the bottom of the tub. Unless you find a way to make it slip-proof, even for babies that sit up well, I would not recommend this product!Our Snug Tub seems to have a slow leak which is also annoying."
2,Oh well...,"The purchase of this product was very smooth and I was so excited to get this tub! Our daughter had outgrown her infant tub and needed something a little bigger to sit and splash around in. This was great, for a while. It's slightly bigger than some other inflatable tubs, so if you have a small tub be prepared for a squeeze. I also liked that you could keep it inflated and hang it to dry using the suction cup attachment. Unfortunately, it only lasted a few months before a very small tear appeared on the side seem. I would expect that to happen eventually after extended use, but we only had it a short time and only deflated and blew it back up 2-3 times within that time span (for traveling). May be we just got a defective tub, but I didn't want to take the chance of wasting money on another tub only for the same thing to happen again, so I ordered a different one. Bummer."
1,Leaks air,"The drain in the bottom of the tub wasn't made correctly and the tub leaked air the first time we used it.We ended up purchasing a different tub at a baby store, and had much better luck. I'd pass on this tub."
4,Snug Tub,Snug Tub is great tub. It fits very well in a standard bath tub. Easy to clean out and I love the hang up feature so that it can dry out. The only down side is emptying the water. The water plug is on the bottom and the weight of the tub with the water in it prevents easy drainage of the water. I literally had to lift that end of the tub up so that the water can drain.
2,"Perfect concept, just plan on buying a vinyl sealer","In using this product for approx. a year, I have to had to use vinyl sealer for a couple of leaks around the seams. The concept is incredible and has saved my daughter's head a couple of times. The non-slip bottom is excellent! She loves playing in it as well. If it were made with better vinyl I would give it a 10 star! Seriously, if you don't want to make repairs, pass on this product otherwise it is money down the drain in approx. 1 month."
3,"Was fantastic, until the seam kept splitting causing slow leaks","This inflatable tub was perfect! A good size, no frills, and a suction cup that worked well for mounting it to the shower wall when we were finished using it. It worked great, until we started noticing slow leaks. We'd super glue one, only to find another a few weeks later. Time to buy a new tub.*Update - all the other tubs have the same negative reviews about splitting seams over time. Since this tub worked so well for us until it split and we love the suction cup, we just bought another one. Ah well."
4,Great for Travel,I bought this tube for a trip I took to Fla. with 3 Toddlers it was worth the money. I loved the fact that i could put in in my suitcase. It did not take up much room where we were staying and now i plan on using it with my 4th child. If it had grips to keep the baby from slideing it would be perfect. I would recomend this for anyone who travels or just wants to give a older baby a comfy place to take a bath.
3,good tub but...,We bought this tub for our 8 month old who sits unassisted very well. The snug tub is good because its inflatable for travel and storage. It is soft for when she plays and leans on the sides and I know she won't get hurt. But... the bottom of the tub is VERY slippery! If I try to stand her to wash her she slips on the bottom. When she plays she gets off balance sometimes and starts to slip so I need to be right next to her to catch before she goes under. The other big downfall I have found is the drain. It is very hard to push it in so you get a complete suction so the water wont drain out. I do like the idea behind the snug tub but I think it could be improved.
5,Grrreat!,"We used the infant bath tub initially but by the time my daughter turned 2 months we started using this inflatable tub. I put it in the tub and though my daughter doesn't sit up yet, she has plenty of room to move her legs and arms while I hold her. Yes, it is more strenuous for my back but it's good fun and exercise for my baby. Also, we don't have much room in my bathroom so we put up two extension rods (like those you use to hang a shower curtain) above the tub and store it on them. This keeps it out of the way though the tub does have a suction cup which works.I can't wait till my baby sits up - I envision putting the Snug Tub out on the porch for her to play in. O, by the way, I haven't reinflated it once since I bought it (about 2 months ago or so)- yes, some of the air escaped, as with all inflatables, but it's still sturdy enough. I also sometimes put a blanket in it and let my daughter 'sit' in it and play with her toys. I find it very versatile."
3,"Ok if you're ""interested,"" but not if you intend to apply it","Gives some good explanation of the wrestling skills you'll need (and some you won't) in a fight against an unarmed opponent, but is light on useful instruction, primarily due to the lack of photographs. There is a lot to be said for an author who will actually fill a book with words, rather than lean on photos as a crutch, but if you intend to train with a book as an aid, photos are all but necessary - and the more the better.You'd be better off with a combination of Winning Wrestling Moves (to instruct on takedowns), combined with one or more of the following: Iverson's submissions book; The Fighter's Notebook; one of the Gracies' BJJ texts. All will give you more practical instruction, and do so with loads of pics to help you get the idea better. All are available at Amazon. You'll pay more to get the more complete education, but if genuine improvement in your grappling skills is the goal, it's worth it."
3,"Good book, can be improvemed.","This book discusses practical street combat from a wrestler's perspective. As expected, the author's focus is from the stand-up engagement that is taken down and finished on the ground. The subject matter is light reading without in-depth instruction. The book's pictures need improvement as the novice may find some figure's inadequate to completely convey the message of the instruction. Overall, the book is a good practical source for both the novice and stand-up only student. It does not add too much value for the mixed-art street oriented combat student."
2,Good book to fantasize about!,"I was a 3 time city champ wrestler in H.S. I know plenty about the sport. However, I don't recommend this book as a manual to learn how to wrestle in the street. The moves are far too advanced for someone to actually pull them off in a real fight. Especially against someone really determined to kick your ass and who won't follow the ""rules"". The author repeats himself over and over, going back to topics in previous chapters etc. He just keeps praising himself as if he were a great fighter. ""Ohh, in my days as a streetfighter this and that"" Overall the book is somewhat disorganized and looks like if a 5th grader wrote it as a book report about wresling. I gave the book 2 stars because he gives pretty good advice about weight training. You will make better use of your hard earned cash taking a Ju-jiutsu book or course."
3,good book but I have better,"The ""reality"" combative followers might be disappointed in this book.Sure it's helpfull and has decent techniques but there is nothing in this book that can't be found elsewhere in REAL photos."
5,Great reference book for Ringneck Doves,"This book has the most complete care, identification, and genetics information available anywhere for the Ringneck Dove (Streptopelia risoria). I highly recommend it for the beginning dove fancier, or the experience breeder.The color photos and advanced genetics information are very clear and easy to follow.You can't go wrong with this one!"
4,Excelent reference for those who own woodlots.,"Though this book is not the easiest to read and comprehend, it provides woodlot owners, such as myself, with information on most any topic relevent to managing a forest. Topics include planting, thinning, volume inventories, contracts with buyers, even log cabin and out-house construction. I should note that I read the 1976 version. The newest edition could be significantly different. I have recently ordered this and will review asap."
3,Organic?,"One of the product features reads ""Organic Quality Whey Protein Isolate"". I was, and I guess still am, looking for organic whey isolate. I cannot find any indication on the container that would let me assume it's organic (and not in the chemical sense, but in the food production sense, ergo from organic milk, or in other words, cows that have been fed only natural foods, not treated with hormones or antibiotics etc etc). Hence, the description in the product features seems misleading."
3,Yes and no,"Well, this is a mixed review. My 2 year old loves this blanket and carries it around everywhere. The problem is that it has major static cling issues and tends to roll up. It will ""shock"" you if it's been dragged around the carpet for awhile and then you try to unroll it.I've tried lots of things to correct it, but after a day or two it is all cling-y again. It takes a lot of the fun out of the throw."
4,Very sweet,"Nice graphic, very soft. My 2 year old loves it. Not a blanket for warmth but she is more into carrying it around like Linus. It's perfect for her purposes."
3,Static Cling,"because of the type of material they use, it creates alot of static cling but other than that, it is bright, cute and works great for a toddler bed."
3,An Ailing Price,"As an avid reader of Eugenia Price novels, I was very excited to read this novel. Unfortunately, I did not think that the Waiting Time held a candle to Price's previous works. I did not feel the strong connection to the characters in this book as I did with the characters in the St. Augustine trilogy or the Savannah quartet. Even at the end of the novel I did not feel that I truly knew the main character, Abby Banes. The story also did not flow as did Price's previous stories. It took too long for problems to be resolved and the love interest for Abby did not capture my heart as did Mark Browning in Savannah or David Fenwick in Maria. One can tell that this book was in fact the last effort of Ms. Price before she passed away in 1996. I will always read anything and eveything written by this brilliant woman, but if I were not such a big fan I would have been even more dissapopinted."
2,Often Annoying,"""Predictable"" might be a good word to summarize this book. ""Repetitious"" would be another. I thought, if Miss Abby tells one more person how much she wants to talk to somebody, I'll put the book down. Instead I found myself highlighting the instances, at least for a little while. There were many.In related news, we learn (for the 50th time) that Eli doesn't talk at all, Obediah talks a lot, Laura Mabrey is helpful AND talkative, and Rosa Moon didn't talk before they hugged and became friends, but now she does. Thaddeus offers, within 3 sentences of their introduction, to talk to dear Miss Abby. Hooray!Characterization is shallow. Plot - well, will she or won't she be able to talk to dear dependable Thad and find happiness? Let's guess.It's grammatical, but beyond that hard to enjoy."
3,Not up to her previous standards,"As always a good story - one that caught my interest and maintained it throughout 3/4 of the book. Then it seemed to drag on and on with much repetition - becoming a ""romance only"" story with many comments being made over and over again. Eugenia Price will be missed and her earlier books should continue to be read with real pleasure."
3,Last book by a wonderful author,"Any book by Eugenia Price is a treasure. However, since this is the last book she wrote, I will treasure iteven more. It may be a little bit repetitive, but that is ok - her stories are timeless....This book is easy read -and not disappointing."
2,Incomplete romance,I agree with the other reviewers that the story got repetitious and tedious. I enjoyed Abby's time with Thad. But the story ended so suddenly. It was really disappointing and anticlimactic. And there was no love scene other than holding hands and kissing.
1,Do Not buy this from Amazon - no customer service,I found the best price on Amazon but that was where the service ended. There was a broken plastic part that controls the auto propel. I requested Amazon order the part for me. They have no idea how to do it or do any kind of customer service. Then I requested some credit and I would go get the part and then they did not even bother with a reply. So by the time I get the part ordered and pay for shipping there is NO advantage from buying this from Amazon.
1,Shipped Damaged,"I'm very disappointed that this highly rated lawn mower arrived damaged. Lawn-Boy immediately gave me a local repair facility that estimated a 3 week backlog of other work. The UPS driver was careful delivering it, so I suspect it was dropped prior to his receipt. The right rear wheel cannot be adjusted beyond setting #2. Bent axel?"
1,sorry lawn boy,Arrived with broken part on handle (sens-s-speed). Didn't understand that this model had separate gas and oil which necessitates oil change (my fault). Very unhappy with product. Previous owner of 4 Lawn Boys with which we were very pleased!
1,damaged by shipping,"Hi,This item was shipped by UPS ground. it was damaged by shipping. I can't comment on how this mower actual work, but i won't definitely buy any mower from internet..."
2,Risky Proposition,"Arrived with broken sens-a-speed, which I didn't realize until I had cranked the mower (beware-- your can't return if you have put gasoline in the mower). Amazon should put more open disclaimers concerning this return policy. Initially, lots of finger pointing as to who was responsible for the part (lawn boy, amazon, or UPS). Got part, installed it , and drive still doesn't work. I'm now working with Lawn Boy (who has been very good) to set up warranty repair. Bottom line... I saved close to $100, but I don't think it was worth it. I've been a loyal Amazon customer for years, but in the case of lawn mowers.......... buy from your local dealer."
1,Mine arrived damaged too!,"Apparently, there's a high risk of getting these nice lawn mowers delivered damaged. Like the reviewer below both rear wheels are toed inward from being dropped. The left rear is so bad that it cannot be adjusted beyond the 2"" mark without the tire hitting the decking. Upon closer inspection of the steel deck at the weld joint it's shows that it's actually cracked! I can see the imprint where the arm hit the deck from being dropped and bent the decking. No telling what the axle looks like. It's really is a shame because the mower itself is of great quality.Amazon has got to do a better job of shipping these mowers or stop selling them. I rate the mower a five, delivery a big fat zero."
4,A lot like Resevoir Dogs...,"First off I hate Eric Stoltz. I think he is a bad actor and has a horrible movie voice. He irritates me to be honest. That being said he is at the top of his limited game in this movie.It is a very simple tale with a very simple setting. The whole French crew and their gregarious lifestyles and generally crazy demeanor is what makes this movie pretty good. These people live life to the fullest and are fun to watch onscreen. Delpy is great as usual, but I do not understand her attraction to Stoltz who is a dolt and largely uninterested in her on a deeper level it seems.Worth a watch. It is not stylish violence though like a Tarentino movie. It is gritty and grimy."
1,"Right up there with ""Dune""","My most recent ex-wife refused to watch this because her daughter's name matched 50% of the title (no...not Killing). When I finally did get to see the thing, I was...let down. It had, after all, been highly recommended by friends. Gosh: drugs, violence, a bit of skin, and ... Dixieland? Except for the Dixieland, I've seen it-seen it-seen it. And so have you.Personally, the only memorable moments involved an expired kitty cat and a brief exchange over the wisdom of doing a line of heroin in a crowded night-spot (Q:What about all these people? A:""Let zem geet zair own"").There are better ways to pass the time."
2,Disapointing.,"Despite all the talent surrounding ""Killing Zoe"" I found it to be routine and disapointing. How could the man who helped write the zany, unpredictable rollercoaster ""Pulp Fiction"" write and direct such a standard, dull movie? This movie rarely held my attention and I felt it was pretentious and contrived. Also, it lacked the surprise and insanity of ""Reservoir Dogs,"" which it frequently seemed to be ripping off and copying off of."
2,Stinks,"Very disappointing. I'm a big fan of Tarantino/Rodriquez-type films, but this one is flat out stupid. No sympathetic characters, action is blurry. Rent it if you must."
4,Hard core flic!,"See this film if you like dark, seedy, in your face drama, action films. All the acting is superb. Eric Stolz is acutally the worst acting in the film. His supporting cast makes up for it."
3,entertaining enough,"Now i'm a big fan of Qeuntin Tarantino(who isn't)he has a stylethat is all his own with american classics like Pulp Fiction,Reservoir Dogs(both written and directed by Tarantino)and thewriter behind the entertaining True Romance and From Dusk Till Dawn he turned the indie film scene into a cult phoenomenon.Helent a hand in this as a executive producer and the film waspretty good.Roger Avary(co-writer of Pulp Fiction)did good withthe writing/directing with this.Alot of violence,profanity,andthe usual drug use the movie is entertaining but Avary is noTarantino.fans of Pulp Fiction,Point Break,Die Hard,etc.rated Rfor strong violence,pervasive languege,drug use,and sex."
1,Killing Zoe does NOT live up to the hype.,"I've been told a few times what a superb movie ""Killing Zoe"" is. I was VERY disapointed at this lame, Tarantino imitation. Avary does not know much about writing a script, apparently. It seems that Hhe spent all his time setting up contrived and over used camera angles. He didn't bother throwing in any surprises or even characters that the viewer could empathize with for that matter. Low budget trash. Maltin was right: I've seen better straight to video sleaze than this."
1,WASTE OF TIME,"I am no fan of Julie Delpy, but she was the best thing about this movie. The film was plotless and a BIG waste of time. Half of the movie is wasted with a bunch of French characters getting drugged up... and all this wasted time really irritated me and actually angered me. I could not believe I was sitting there watching such stupidity. (I had to sit through it because a friend agreed to watch a movie I recommended if I would do the same). Eric Stoltz could do better than this, but for some reason, here he is in this film about a prostitute (Delpy) who saves the day (at least for Stoltz) after a bank robbery gone bad. If I could give this film ZERO stars, I would. Don't waste a moment of your precious time on this garbage."
2,.,"A relatively bad movie which is helped primarily by an interesting premise and (here and there) some real style. The first half of this movie is drawn-out, poorly acted, and generally incredibly dull. The second half, once the heist begins, is circumstantially well set up and sometimes entertaining, at one or two points even a touch brilliant, but it isn't enough to counterbalance the questionable performances (save for the really mean French guy, he's great), the over-the-top gimmicks, the badly developed drama, and general chaotic, self-indulgent unevenness that plague the movie as a whole."
4,Show me the real Paris.,"Cool flick that distorts some of the usual action-flick macho-isms with a nice frosted layer of drugs, heroin, aids and dixieland jazz. The driving through Paris scene is enough! Very cool. Notice the sleepy euro techno track underneath it all; pretty sophisticated slice of sound. A somewhat oversimplified ending...but this movie has cartoon qualities that work nice for what it is. I love the actress that plays the bankteller... she is my dreamgirl from Paris."
4,hardcore fun,"If you the kind of movie watcher who is in to fastpaced get to the action films like True Romance,Pulp Fiction,or Reservoir Dogs you'll love KillingZoe.A Tarantino style but Avary co writer of PulpFiction did great with the writing and directing ofthis.Eric Stoltz gives a stellar performance as Zedthe ex con american safecracker,and Jean Hughes alsogives a great performance as Eric the violent,andcareless freind of Zed.Filled with graphically violentaction,fast profane dialogue,and great charactors KillingZoe is an all around great movie."
2,"""Killing Zoe"" is just average.","""Killing Zoe"" is a slow moving bank hiest gone awry film that is no where near as involving or breathtaking as Quenton Tarintino's ""Reservoir Dogs,"" which brilliantly tackles similar material. ""Killing Zoe"" simpley lacks Tarintino's energetic story telling abilities. It also lacks intresting characters we can relate to, complexity, and plot twists. It contains virtually no character developement and no big twists or turns in the plot. Not to mention the huge holes in logic."
2,Leonard Maltin hit the nail on the head.,"I agree with Maltin's review completely, it was disapointing and completly average. Considering films such as ""Albino Alligator,"" ""Reservoir Dogs,"" and ""In Harm's Way,"" ""Killing Zoe"" is nothing special or worth checking out."
2,"Good direction, bad plot.","Flashy camera work does not make a good movie. This was never more evident than in Avary's ""Killing Zoe."" The director is obviously a talented director. As a writer, however, he ignores key elements such as character developement, plot twists, and the most important element in any hiest film: the element of surprise. Despite one scene involving an explosion, ""Killing Zoe"" is frequently predictable and plain dull. If you want to see a good caper movie check out Tarantino's ""Resevoir Dogs"" or Kubrick's ""The Killing."""
2,Great While It's Working,"I've heard great things about vtech phones. I'm not sure if I just have bad luck and keep hitting a bad batch. However I've had two of these models. I'm on my third replacement. The first 6821 I had the power on button stopped responding after one week, soon I was toggling the speakerphone button as a means to answer the phone. That stopped responding a few days after the on button. Soon after that the off button stopped working. Vtech replaced the phone under warranty. Great service. Second phone, about 3 months in the on button once again stopped responding, fearing the same it was returned again. hopefully 3 is the charm, but i'd prefer it to be okay on the first try. otherwise the features/price are great for this phone"
3,On/Off buttons stopped working after a year,For the first year I was completely satisfied with this phone. It was elegant and functional. I really loved the fact that it has a message waiting indicator that integrates with my internet phone provider.After a year the off button became increasingly hard to press so much so that a little while later it would not respond at all. The On button started to exhibt the same problem soon.
2,Poorly made,"I don't know if the Thomas friends have gotten kind of cheap since the new company took over, but Fergus is not a well made toy. The first Fergus we had, the wheel broke off. The company was really good about replacing him, but the replacement came and within a week he too was broken, not only the wheel, but part of the wood had chipped off. The idea is kind of cool, the wheel turns the gear , turning another wheel. That is all plastic, including the axle for the middle gear. Maybe had that axle been metal, it would be more durable. I can't recommend this as a toy, only for the collector."
2,Okay if there isn't something better around,"Having read numerous other books on a similar subject, I have to say that I was disappointed in this one. While the writing style is nice, and the idea of having one's children taken away is indeed emotional, I found that in this book all conflicts wrapped up nicely, neatly, and FAR too easily and quickly at the end. So quickly and easily, in fact, that there may as well have been no conflict at all, and what's worse, the author starts setting up the easy resolution pretty early on. I kept reading thinking there would be a twist at the end, but nope--if you read this book and after about the first third, you start to think--it can't really be that easy, can it?--well, yes, it can.If you're looking for a light read with unneccesary romantic side stories for the lesser characters, this is a great choice. Not a horrible book, but not a book that makes me want to read her other two."
5,"Perfect fit, quick delivery, and it came with the bulbs!","This taillight assembly fit perfectly as a replacement for my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. It took about five minutes to remove the old light, transfer the trim flap, and install the new unit. I was pleasantly surprised when I checked and discovered that the light bulbs were included! I had looked on eBay and most of those didn't come with the bulbs.I used my Amazon Prime for second day shipping and the package actually showed up a day early!"
4,tail light assembly,The product arrived quicker than I expected and neatly packaged. It fit perfectly but I found it $10 cheaper in Ebay :-(
5,tailights,I was surprised and delighted to find the part I needed on amazon.com. Furthurmore there was a very nice deal that made the decision to buy from this source easier. The part arrived in a short amount of time and I was able to replace my damaged tail light lens easily as the fit and finish of the new part was exactly as the original. And the thing came with all the lightbulbs installed!!. It was a quick plug and play and I was on the road again.This was my first experience with Amazon.com and now all my purchases are shopped here first.
5,This all in one Solution Fixes Jeep Tail Light Problems!!!,"I spent 1 hour trying to fix one of my tail lights. Went bought new lamp sockets for $10 each (3 per light), then bought two replacement light bulbs for $8. I couldn't get the other tail light to work so I ordered this tail light. It took 3 minutes to take off old taillight and install this all in one unit (lamp sockets and lights installed)."
3,Entertaining and interesting at times,"Multiple modes of presentation including time travelers, scripted show, description, letters critiquing sections of the book are sometimes interesting and entertaining. Clearly the author is well informed and feels free to present viable but unpopular views. Fundamentalists and literalists beware. Yet overall the book is a mixed bag and unsatisfying because the imbalance does not hold together to present a consistent perspective. Sometimes one may draw general conclusions at others instances may or may not be representative."
2,A flawed attempt to make history more readable.,"I was disappointed with this book. The admittedly clever techniques of trying to explain early Christianity through the notes of time travelers, a television script, make believe letters between early Christians, and critiques of these techniques from ""colleagues"" simply didn't work for me.Don't get me wrong, there is obviously solid scholarship behind this unique presentation. The information presented is very interesting but the method of story telling gets in the way. The author is a academic and not a novelist. The contrived nature of the novel-like elements detracted from the history being presented.The book did add to my historical understanding of the development of Christianity, but I would not wish to read another work of scholarship written in a similarly ""innovative"" style"
4,Excellent effort to convey a 'feeling' for the past,"I found this book to be very readable and to have achieved what the author seems to have been trying to accomplish. Hopkins says he is trying to give readers a feeling for the complex spiritual landscape in which Christianity became dominant in the West. The only improvement I might have hoped to find in this book is a better linkage to historical events in secular society, in the usual event panorama presented in histories of this period. Nevertheless, I will keep this book handy to consult when I want to remind myself of the process of cultural evolution that shaped this important part of Western Civilization."
1,just like other books,Pretty much repeats himself. If you have his other books don't worry about getting this one and wasting your time. Author is very arrogant and has a big ego and that is a turn off.
4,useful,"I read this book for a methods course as well as some of the other reviewers. The format of the book is useful since it provides a synopsis of the selected perspectives as well as a reading that provides an example of the method/interpretation in action. While it is not always entertaining, it is not designed to be; it is a critical reader designed to promote critical discussion. I completed an annotated bibliography of the work (since Troup references many scholars and their works) and found this very useful so that I could read the better known examples that Troup discusses in each section. This book is a good spring board to further studies in the historian's journey to becoming thinking historian who is sensitive to the relationship between worldview, interpretation and methods in the historian's research."
4,Houses of History,"A good, easy to follow guide to schools of history. Though some of the schools may be more method than actual approach, the work gives easy to follow explanations of the schools, their adherents, arguments and problems followed by an example of what the editor considers typical of the school."
3,"Theory explanation is suitable, but the example texts appear somewhat random or even arbitrary","Read most of this book for an historiography class, and couldn't get over how odd some of the sections that were used to exemplify a particular type of history. Not the authors or the books referenced themselves, but that the sections didn't really provide a great example of what was described. Now of course you can't choose a section that is hundreds of pages long to exemplify, so perhaps this only appears to be an issue for me due to the impossibility of the task"
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Mitchell Gant, after nicking Firefox, has survived a dogfight. He doesnot come out completely unscathed, and is forced to ditch the plane.The rest of this thriller revolves around the attempts to get back tothe plane, and get Gant back to the plane, as he is the only many theyhave currently qualified to have a chance of flying it out of Laplandfor them."
5,birkies,"The only words that I can say are wonderful! The savings were great. I own several pairs of birkenstocks and they're not cheap, however they are quality shoes that last. You get what you pay for. Being a health acre provider these are the only shoes that I have found that last. Knowing that it prompted me to start wearing them for everyday wear also."
5,great footwear,"I have had 1 pair of Birkenstocks before that required a bit of ""foot shaping break-in time"". These were comfortable from the first time they were put on and remain comfortable all day long. They were well worth the money."
5,Eaton Clog,The Eaton Clog is just as I'd hoped. I have fibromyalgia and depend on the Birkenstock shoes to keep me from having leg and hip pain. The Eaton is nice looking & was totally comfortable even the first day I wore them (shopping!). I like ordering over the net & the order arrived very quickly.
5,Rave Reviews From MOM,"I use birkenstocks all the time, and finding this pair for my mom was wonderful. I always get her something nice for Mother's day, but she loves these shoes so much that she now wants them in tan. I got her a black pair. She wears them all the time, But she has to match. I urge people to try Birkenstocks, they make back and foot problems disappear."
5,the best clog,"this is the best clog I've ever worn. very comfortable, fit true to size, also very chic and the most important one is the sale price :) catch it before it's gone."
2,Superficial coverage,"Initially, the title of the book makes it seem exciting. However, all topics are covered very briefly and the book assumes the reader has a large repository of knowledge (so much so that, in fact, those who possess that knowledge would not actually need this book!). Coverage of alterntative market forms is weak. Unfortunately, this book is continued testimony to the fact that Brits still live in their experience, oblivious to the incredibly cutting edge work being done in this sector in other parts of the world."
3,Solid Product,"This device is very convenient because of its size. I have two observations:Battery:The instructions did not come with an indication on battery size needed to operate the device. I had to play trial and error. Luckily, the store attendant allowed me to test out several (none of which fit). I guessed at the 57 size and it worked (this battery is a watch battery, and it is the flatest size). Take it to the store when you buy the battery.Volume Control:The device does not have a volume control. Because it fits in your ear like tiny earphone buds, it is very loud. I use my device for sports not music so that makes a big difference. I prefer to wear it clipped to the top of my shirt instead of in my ear.Great tool though."
1,Korg MM-1,"I bought a Korg MM-1 Micro Metronome...the idea is great, a small in the ear metrognome. The problem is that this unit is pretty much worthless. Obviously the setting controls are small and hard to see and use, especially for those of us needing reading glasses. Main problem is the unit is unreliable and worked only sporadically. Several times I would have to remove the battery and then re-install to get the unit to work...finally I've figured the best thing to do is simply throw this unit away and find something that actually works. jg"
2,Korg MM1 impractical design,"I bought the Korg MM1 to help with drum rudiments - those repetitious things you must do. However, I soon found that when adjusting it in the ear, it is nearly impossible to NOT touch one of the three controls which will change the tempo up or down or change the mode.I'm considering sawing a penny in half and using silicon sealer to glue it right over the KORG on the body - like the back fin of a fish. Then and only then will I have something to hold onto that doesn't have a control button.Once the back fin is in place I'd give it 4 stars due to its handy size and capabilities. Out of the box, its only 2 stars."
2,It's not what I spected,"I'm a drumer, and I wanted to buy de MM-1 to use it while rehersing with the band. The problem is that when I start playing I can't follow the beat of the MM-1 because I can't hear it over the drum set, the guitars, the base and the vocals!!! So there's no use to try it while playing with a band. I could recomend it to Bass or Guitar players to practice at home, but nothing else."
5,An Amazing Experience,"If you are looking for an awesome cd, this is it. I have found my new favorite band. Each song is different, and equally powerful and moving in its each unique way. With a unique blend of different instruments that are normally not heard on many cd's Five O'Clock People bring originallity to the market. This is a great CD, BUY IT!"
4,Soft and thoughtful,"This CD blew me away. I'm used to really rocking music (ie punk, alternative, etc.) but when I heard the first song, ""Lunar"" I was amazed at the band's talent. Not only do they create their own musical style, but their lyrics are so truthful and profound that it's hard not to get into the music. I'll admit, this isn't a CD that you're going to move to... it's more of a quieting melody that soothes and yet presents the truth of God's word. I must admit, this is one of the best CD's I've seen in a long time."
5,Cia. Clic and Daniela Mercury,"This is the firt CD of Daniela Mercury's career, when she took part at Cia. Clic. Very good rithm and songs."
4,Ramona The Best! by William Robert,"Ramona is very good at calling people names like ""yard ape"" etc. It was a cool name to give to a particular character in this book. My favorite character in this book was exactly ""Yard Ape"", because he likes baseball and I like baseball. My second favorite character was Ramona herself, because she is funny and she likes aadventures like I do. I think the book is special because it has very funny characters. This is not a lie!. Beverly Cleary is the 2nd best author I have read in my life. I have read 3 books by her. I even did a project about the book. Tha's all I have to say about this great book."
5,Ramona learns it is always easy being eight years old.,"It is not always easy being in the third grade as Ramona Quimby learns. Ramona learned that you should not always follow the latest fad because it could and most likely will end in disaster. So, in response to that she tries to create her own fads. Ramona also learns to take responsibility for others when she has to watch out for Willa Jean at her baby-sitters house. Ramona and her family learn a valuable lesson at the end of the story. This was an excellent book and I am sure that most children would enjoy it and be able to sympathize with some of the situations Ramona finds herself in."
3,This book is sometimes boring.,This book is about a girl in third grade who doesn't like her teacher very much but who in the end likes her. We didn't love this story because sometimes it was confusing. There were some funny and exciting scenes but at times it got boring.
5,Ramona Quimby age 8,"I am a 9 years old boy in fourth grade.This story is about a girl named Ramona 8 years old.Ramona goes to a new scool and tries to make it the best day.But everything got worse when this boy steals Ramona's new pink eraser.She then calls him Yard ape.When Yard ape see's Ramona squeaking her shoes he calls her bigfoot then Ramona says,""super foot to you.""I like this story because it was funny,unusual,gross and weird.When you read this book you will get grossed out like i did.Well at the end Ramona findes out she has to be nice when the stranger buys the food for what the Quimbys had. THE END"
3,Ramona is in third grade,I choose this rating because I like Ramona when she gets in trouble and I enjoyed reading this book because I like Ramona a little bigger.
2,Ramona lacks excitement,"I used this book as a read aloud in my 3rd grade classroom, and to put it bluntly, my students found it to be boring. A lot of the language seemed ""dated."" During Cleary's attempts at humor, I found my students staring at me with ""I don't get it"" looks on their faces. I have found the whole Ramona series to be a little disappointing. A better choice for 3rd graders is the Fudge series by Judy Blume.To put it bluntly, my 3rd graders found this book to be boring. I used this book as a read aloud in my classroom."
3,This book wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.,"The school made me read this book and it was O.K. Although there were some bad parts, most of the book was fine. But the author tries so hard to make you laugh, it is really not funny."
3,Average,"As a kid I devoured science fiction. As an adult, I just can't do it any more. Bought two different books for an18 hour flight to Europe. COuldn't get through them."
2,a little bit inferior quality,"Length:: 0:20 MinsMy first impression of the shoes is ""those shoes are a little bit roughly made"".Right side is OK, but left side looks rough. I think the products contains some bad things.I think that the condition of each product should be all about luck, but I wanted to share the information with you."
3,A little tight,"I should have ordered this as a size 12 or 11 1/2 if available but I still likeed the shoe and still have them for around the house lounging around but not good for any strenuous sport because of snug because of size, not the shoe."
4,PeeWees - Disposable Dry Washcloths Review,After bringing my daughter home from the hospital I discover her skin was to sensitive to use baby wipes. Thank goodness for PeeWees - Disposable Dry Washcloths. I use them instead of baby wipes and my daughter's bottom have yet to turn red or received a rash. A also use them to wash her face because PeeWees Washcloths are softer than regular washcloths. They're bigger too! The only downfall to this product is there are only 24 in a box. Which means baby wipes are a lot cheater.
2,Not impressed,"Compared to other dry wash cloths, these were both small, expensive and not as good. When you can get 500 pcs for just above 20 usd why buy these?"
3,Quick but dirty,Product arrived quickly. Not quite as nice looking as I had expected. But I would buy from this seller again.
2,No where near as good as the Dictionary!,"Our family has greatly enjoyed the Scholastic Children's Dictionary, so it made sense to also get the Scholastic Children's Thesaurus. What a disappointment! Nearly every word my fourth grader looks up (for school work) is not in this book. It is pretty much useless for her school work. Don't bother with it!"
2,Bought this based on a 5-star review? WHY??,My child is in 3rd grade and must look up synonyms. Very few of the words on her lists are in this book. This is not a helpful book at all. I guess I should buy an adult thesaurus for 3rd grade!
4,A Thesaurus Kids Can Relate To,"I like the font of this thesaurus. The font is reasonably big so that children can follow along - not like regular thesauruses that even I find difficult to read for long.What I didn't like was that the pictures were not that interesting. Often the drawings had very little to do with the text and was just an additive to, I guess, make the page pretty. Kids need to read something that attracts them, that keeps their attention, and pictures always do that.It is hardcover and has many, many words that are given and replaced with and so I do like the book. It is just a little below what I expected from scholastic books.For the money, however, I find that it is a great buy!"
2,Poor Descriptions of Indians,"The pieces on Fijian-Indians in 'Fiji' and 'The Mynah Birds', in which local Indians are shown up in an ugly and racist manner, are just bad writing. To his credit Michener apologised about his untoward remarks years after the publication of the book."
5,Overlooked Treasure!,"I loved this book. While reading Tales of the South Pacific, I was interested in the island cultures which played behind the main stories. This book delves into those cultures, as they were when the book was written. Nice stories."
3,Enjoyable stories,The descriptions of the islands makes one want to vacation there or possible live for a short period of time.
2,The voice of Asia,"Is this a reprint of ""The Voices of Asia?"" Som of the reviews read like it might be. I will be reading it, but for now I found 'Voices' to be excellent and would not be surprised to see it reprinted."
1,Disappointing Sequel,"Having read Tales of the South Pacific, one of the classics of 20th Century literature, I couldn't wait to read this 'sequel' by Michener. I wished I hadn't bothered. It seemed as if the great wordsmith was just writing because his publisher demanded to cash in on the success of 'Tales'. Disappointed, I put it down about a third of the way through and never bothered to pick it up again. It takes two to tango - even in a novel. Michener (the author) and I (the reader)danced our way through 'Tales' never missing a step. With the sequel it was if we had two left feet."
4,Interesting espionage mystery,"A top secret agency one day has its valued spy jump out the fifth floor window. But was agent Lister's death a suicide or really a murder? Frank Finley plays the agent who suspects something else is behind his death. Lister was entrusted with a huge database of top secret information and he tries to trace who might want to murder him. He uncovers a plan by one of the agency directors to cheat the tax revenue service out of millions of dollars, a plan Lister might have leaked out. But his movements are tracked and he is in danger, too. The first film appearance of Natasha Richardson as a flirty secretary."
5,Very Helpful Shorter Commentary,"I have used this one several times. It is a great short commentary. Over and over I have found this commentary gives succinct reviews without skimping on the most important aspects.It is a beautiful complement to a fuller treatment like Fung or Bruce.Jervis brings clear and often teachable/preachable points for each passage. She also gives a careful handling of the text. I have not found a passage yet where she makes the error many commentators make, to insert their favorite theological persuasion into the text.I have used this book as a jumpstart when doing sermon exegesis and am short on time...or just when I need another perspective. It's one of my top five commentaries on Galatians. I give it a big thumbs up."
5,Great CD to add to you SP collection,"I have been a long time Skinny Puppy fan, going all the way back to the mid 80's and have followed them all the way to present day and all their side & solo projects (download, rx, tear garden, ohgr, etc) and this is a must have for any Skinny Puppy fan's collection. A lot of the songs on the B Sides are still classic hits on Industrial dance floors today, including songs like Addiction, Yes He Ran, Mirror Saw, Tin Omen I, Nature's Revenge and Shore Lined Poison. This is a must own CD for all Skinny Puppy fans and as a fan and DJ of industrial music I would highly recommend owning this CD."
2,Strictly a period piece,"The only reason I read this book was because I've just read a book (Saveage Grace) about the Baekwell family who lived in Paris during the 1950's and 1960's, were good friends of James Jones & his wife, and on whom he based the Gallagher family in this novel.The best things I can say about this book is that it's a decent short history of the student uprising in France in 1968 & if you're familiar with Paris at all, it gives an accurate description of the city. Other than that, the book is verbose, its depiction of women woefully sexist and out of date, and gives the reader the cringing feeling one gets when an older person is tring to be ""with it."" This book definitely has not stood the test of time."
4,Only a Poet?,"I was very surprised that I got through this book. It is not every day that a person will pick up a collection of essays on Classical, Elizabethan and other types of literature, for enjoyments sake. Eliot really outdid himself with his reviews of the literature that he was surrounded by. The definite reads, if you do not want to go through all the essays, are the essays ""Dante"", ""Hamlet and his Problems"" and ""A Dialogue on Dramatic Poetry"". ""Dante"" is a beuatiful study on both the ""Divina Comedia"" and ""Vita Nouva"". ""Hamlet"" is a putdown on the play that everyone ""loves"" so much--with the exception of the writer of this sentence. ""Dialogue"" is a well crafted arguement of the essence of the poetic plays and how they fit into modern--it was written in 1922--times. This book is pure genius, although at points rather ""holier-than-thou."" Eliot was a genius and he makes sure to let you know it in his essays."
5,A useful book,"The Collected essays are quite useful to my study. They help readers to get further understanding about Eliot's thinking and insight to politics and society in seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Also, Elito clearly elucidates his idea in logical writing which may be benefitial to readers' writing."
4,Mathematics of Classical and Quantum Physics,This book serves as a very useful compilation of mathematicalareas and techniques needed for the study of classical physicsand most quantum physics.It is useful because it is a compilation of many different mathematicaltopics in one place however for the wary it does require at leastan exposure of many of the covered mathematical areas at the collegelevel at some time in one's life. By that it is meant that it isnot necessarily an 'easy read' unless one has just completedgraduate work in mathematics or physics.It can be read however on a chapter by chapter basis and if one isa little rusty in certain areas such as advanced calculus or linearalgebra one can supplement the various chapters with review ofappropriate material to refresh the mind.A good book but not one for the mathematically challenged orfaint of heart.
4,Excellent math reference for physicists,"As the title says, it's one of the best books for mathematics in physics. Not simple at first glance (not indicated for first students, I guess), but good to review some math..."
2,Very labor intensive,I ordered this to hopefully heat my living area better and lower my energy costs however it didn't come with any instructions and when I contacted the company they sent me a worthless page of instructions lol. If you really know how to install it or you're willing to pay to have it installed go for it.
1,BURNS if your child has a yeast-related diaper rash!!!,"This is the worst product for diaper rash caused by yeast. My 6-year old sweats a lot and got a bit of a yeast infection around his groin, so I put Desitin on it to help it heal and prevent further moisture. Well, he started screaming! I couldn't get the stuff off of him fast enough. A few months later, I had a yeast infection and decided to test it out on me to see if I got the same reaction - YOWZA! It burned so badly I was nearly frantic trying to get the stuff off. It MAY help prevent a rash, but it is NOT recommended if your child already has a rash that might be yeast-related. I feel like the worst parent on the planet for putting this stuff on my two sons when they were babies."
3,won't clear diarrhea diaper rash,"My sister uses this for all her babies, but for my boys, it doesn't seem to work. Both my boys had severe diaper rash from diarrhea (teething related I think), and Desitin just didn't clear those. I finally went to see my pediatrician after a week using Desitin and Butt paste, and she recommended Dr. Lee's diaper cream. The next day, daycare called and asked me what I had done on my boy's butt :) hahahaha it was all healed. But Desitin is great on daily prevention I think and the price is definitely right."
4,Joaquin,"The product that buys and seems that uy is good, was a gift for my wife and until now it to liked much and quality of the product is good, of envio also was good thanks."
2,I think Ted Hawkins is wonderful but....,"If you're only going to buy one Ted Hawkins CD make sure it's not this one. (Go for ""Songs From Venice Beach"" or the ""Next Hundred Years."")This CD is mainly the ""filler"" that was cut when the original Venice Beach tapes was reduced from 2 LPs to one CD (Songs From Venice Beach.) The result is that Songs From Venice Beach has most of the best material. However, this CD does have Ted Hawkins singing ""Dock of the Bay"" and ""Chain Gang"" without which no Ted Hawkins collection is complete.So if you're a Ted Hawkins fan you do need to buy this CD, just don't buy it first."
1,CD Review,"Lovely sound. Then CD started skipping and does not not play. Not sure why, looks clean, but does not play without skipping all over the place"
5,Incredible,"From the opening notes this is a journey into sonic landscapes that only the legendary JMJ can create. Only this time, these tracks have a more ""organic"" feel about them as they are performed by a symphony orchestra. I have every JMJ CD and this is easily in the top 3 if not number 1 overall. It is that good. I cannot recommend this any higher. If you are a fan of beautiful music, you owe it to yourself to buy this CD. It is simply outstanding. I only wish that more of JMJ's music is released in this format. Once you have heard this CD you will yearn for more."
5,Perfect from the past,"It is good product i recommended to someone loves really music. I loved so much, I used to have it in vinyl and now inCD."
5,Makes you realize he's an amazing composer,"I've listened to JMJ since receiving Oxygene as a promo album working at a radio station in the 70's. I have to say I've loved some pieces and not loved others. But mostly loved. What this does is take the electronic realization variable out and let you listen to JMJ in the same realm as other contemporary composers. And as others have said, it will give you goosebumps. I read somewhere that his father, the brilliant, amazing composer Maurice Jarre was somewhat disapproving of the route JMJ took. He only passed away March of this year (2009). I hope he heard this, if he did, I wonder what he thought. This symphonic recording lets you see, for the first time, the soaring, free, emotional, imaginative, characteristics common to both composers."
1,Antenna kit,A mediocre performer. It amplifies noise equally so you get the same weak signal in relation to the background.
4,It's pretty cool.,"If you have a scanner and are trying to get ultralow bands, then this is for you. It does what is says it does, but it isn't going to change the way you do scanning.It's a nice accessory and building it was a bit tricky but nothing god awful. Take your time and be patient.Overall it gets a 4 because the price seems a bit much for what you get and the case that comes with it isn't a ""perfect fit"", some of the knobs stick out a bit more than I would like. However, it does do a nice job of getting lower bands in and also is compact which is all I needed it for."
1,Bernard Baruch : My Story,Bernard Baruch's story is very interesting but I was very disappointed in the quality of this book.
3,Is Nothing Sacred?,"Jeesh, it's getting so even the most obscure treasures in my vinyl collection are for sale as CDs now......I honestly didn't think this one was known by very many people.....""What's A Man"" is the killer track....I used to use it to show off my sound system.....today it remains a great demo for my sub-woofer....if anybody knows anything about the band....please post....."
5,Disclaimer:,"I haven't read this book yet, but I studied at U. of Michigan and Thomas Garbaty was one of the most exciting and beloved professors in the English Department. I ended up studying whatever he was teaching, whether or not the subject matter was directly related to my major, just because I knew it would be fascinating."
2,Missing some key information,"There is no mention of how to calculate insulin dosage based on number of carbohydrates in a meal. And that is the whole reason I had bought the book. Sure it tells you how to count carbs, but it doesn't say what you can do with that knowledge."
2,Not like the Original.,I've used a Stainless Parker Jotter for work since 1990. I've never had a complaint with the original refills. In need of ink on various occasions in the past couple of years I have had to use the Gel Ink. The Gel Ink goes down bold and thick but the tip is not as smooth as the standard refills and the ink is very easily lifted if rain or other liquids come in contact with what you have just written. Another drawback with the amount of ink that gets put down is that a refill may only last a week whereas the original refills would last me months!This complaint may sound a little extreme but one drop onto the shop floor with the tip extended renders the refill useless. This is in stark contrast to the original refills which occasionally I have dropped 2 or 3 times with no adverse effects to the writing ability.Hope this is helpfullShalomMichael
4,"Great ink, but fades outside.","I agree with all the positive reviews. People that use my pen all comment about how great it is. (I use the gel ink with Parker's Jotter). I inspect fire extinguishers at a hospital. I noticed that the inspections on the roof have faded, even though the extinguishers are covered with a shroud. I am not sure if temperature variations or filtered sunlight cause the fading. This is great ink, but not so for outdoor use, even when not exposed to direct weather and sunlight."
2,"3 packs, each had one working refill","As noted by Flashbizz in his review, the packages all have one refill with a wax covering, and one refill without (and therefore completely dried out). I thought his experience was an aberration, but I ordered 3 packs and each had the same problem. I guess this supplier bought a huge batch of defective ones, and they are dumping them on Amazon. Buyer beware... your two-pack is really a one-pack."
2,Doesn't last long enough,"Not a huge fan of this product. Love the way it writes but in less than a few months, I'm buying it again. (and there are 2 refills) I decided to switch pens instead."
3,Are you Gel'n?,Only bad thing is you have to write slower using a gel pen as the ink oozes down to the ball. Traditional ink is thinner and reacts well to your body heat providing a faster response when writing.
1,Spotty preformance,"These refills get blotchy ink on the bottom, which I have to wipe off. Also they skip on almost every sentence. Garbage."
5,Parker T-Ball Gel refill,The Parker T-Ball Jotter is unique in that it rotates the ink refill assembly 90 degrees when extended to spread wear evenly. The sintered iron ball is closer in dimensions to a sugar cube than a ball to gain traction on the paper and hold ink for a skip free start. The gel refill is the best and if placed on a long sheet of paper will write about 2 miles. The gel ink glides smoothly and is a pleasure to use.
1,poor quality,"The ink was older, somewhat crushed and dried up after approximately one week of moderate use. Would not recommend the product."
5,Parker refill,"Great refill, good price. I hope it's going to last longer then the previous one. So far I'm very satisfied with it. It fits in other pens."
5,BALLPOINT INK THAT BEHAVES LIKE INK!,"Ink actually soaks into the paper, ergo the intensely visible and permanent image. Was really glad to find that Amazon carries these, since I had beem unable to find them in HUGE brick and mortar locations - they all either had 4 or 6 pegs devoted to the same old greasy ballpoint ink refills,and one (either empty, or none at all) for the Gel Ink type. And, as with so many of them, when Ichecked back weeks and sometimes months later, the peg was still empty, or gone altogether.I will never understand why so many retailers seem to adopt an attitude of disregarding theidea of replacing items that have sold out of stock...it's truly unfathomable to me.With Prime, they were shipped free to my doorstep in two days! Frustrations released, thanks toAmazon Prime!"
5,Excellent conversion,Like so many other poeple I have become addicted to the modern gel pens.These refills allowed me to convert and start using several old style corporate logo pens that had been languishing in a desk drawer.Excellent idea.
3,No as fluid as I had hoped.,I got these refills for a couple of pens that I really liked and wanted to keep using. I have gotten used to gel pens that flow so freely and do not skip or scratch across the page. I am very disappointed that these Parker refills did not provide superior performance to the generic refills I replaced.
2,DRIED OUT,Well I like all parker pens and the gel is the best but on this order all but one refill have the little wax tip off this made the ink dry out so 5 of the 6 I ordered where no good shame others i had gotten have been ok this was the first with them dried out this bad. I am glad I still had one left from other order not sure but i think I will go to office store for my next ones.
4,Parker Refill for Retractable Gel Ink Pens,"The refills write a smooth, dark black line. Writing has a nice feel to it. However, the downside is that the ink supply runs out far sooner than I expected, effectively making these expensive refills."
1,Lousy Batch of what has been a quality product,"I've used Parker Gel refills for years. Decided to try to save a little money this year. Instead of buying them from a major office supply store, I went with this Amazon seller. These were not the same quality, even though all the packaging was identical to store-bought. It was as if they were dried out. The gel ""went dry""/ran out much sooner than ever before."
1,Blue Parker Gel Ink refills,"These blue refills are a much lighter blue than the Parker gel refills I purchased at Staples. The first of the two didn't flow well and felt ""scratchy"" instead of gliding across the paper like the refills I procured from Staples. The first one was so bad I threw it away the first day. I'll throw the second away as soon as I can get to Staples and buy some ""good"" replacements. I suspect they were not genuine Parker refills, but I don't know for sure."
4,Nice ink,"I like using this ink because it is smooth and writes very well. I get a lot of compliments on how well my pen works when I use it. The only problem I run into is the fact that I use it a lot and the ink runs out kind of fast. However, it is gel ink after all so in that regard is kind of expected. It is also not too expensive, so what's there to lose?"
5,Great refill for Smith & Wesson Pens and Azan Tactical Pen,"Great writing pen, better than OEM, YOU WILL NEED TO SAVE YOUR SPRING. No spring with this refill. Again this refill works for the Azan Defense Tool First Line Tactical Pen and all Smith&Wesson tactical pens"
5,Great Item,Nice! Fits worn-out promo pens that I wanted to keep cause they were made very sturdy. So these new cartridges work great!
5,The best gel ink out there!,I have bought the gel refills for all of my Parker pens and am very happy with the results. The ink is very smooth and never skips or blobs. I also have a Cross pen with a gel refill and the quality of the Cross gel ink is not even close to as good as Parker's version.
1,very poor quality,"I was only able to write with these refills 2 days each, after this something happens and ink just starts flowing uncontrollaby.Not what I expect from Parker labeled product."
5,Very nice!,I bought these in blue with a medium point for a Parker Jotter.They fit perfectly and work well. They write as well as a Pilot G2 and the medium point is about the same as a 0.70 mm G2 point.I highly recommend these over the Parker rolling ball refills.
2,Horrible fluidity,"I cannot write even one word without it skipping. Just about every other letter has missing spots (like half the letter) and when I try to go back over them it just leaves a mess that is not acceptable for my own notes let alone any kind of serious correspondence or form filling. I've tried warming it up using scratch paper, using alcohol around the nib, nothing is working."
4,nona rocks,too bad like other black artists who wanna purseu rock or metal she'll be unrecognized since i'm into p funk george clinton dr. funkenstein himself p's on the track baby a go go a must have for serious maggots but nona was'nt bad herself lesbians rock.
3,The same as I remembered--almost!,"My husband had a copy of People in My Family, the golden shape book, when he was a child. Unfortunately, the book disintegrated before the second of our two children arrived, and we wanted to replace it. Being that the book was out of print, we weren't sure we'd be able to locate a copy, but Amazon.com didn't let us down! We purchased a used copy, and received it in a timely fashion. The book was just as we remembered--almost. There seemed to be an additional section at the end. The additional ending, however, did nothing to mar the childlike memory of the original story/song."
3,"Confusing magic, overpopulated fun","I cannot understand the magic in The Last Rune series, with the blood, and runes and gates and Weirding. I was completely confused by the gate magic in this book. But you get the feeling that it's all going to come together in the end. It is quite depressing to have a likable character imprisoned in a lab, and being experimented on, but you have to admit, this makes a fairly routine fantasy a little different. There are far too many subplots, and the core group of characters--Travis, Grace, Beltan, Durge and Arya--needs to come together soon. The book uses too much of one my least favorite fantasy-epic devices: Having different characters doing things in different locations. How are these events related? It's all going to come together, in the end, but Mr. Anthony best not drag this series out, the way Bob Jordan did with the monstrous Wheel of Time. He needs to refocus, in the next book."
2,Surprisingly.... boring,"Why is it that every new installation in this series not only introduces new characters but also new plot twists?It seems that Mark Anthony is making up the story as he goes along. There are no frameworks, no build up, things just ""happen"" and there are no explanations... The first book in the series could have been forgiven as the first attempt but the rest? I don't know there are so many good books out there and this isn't one of them unless it was intended for young audiences rather than adults....."
2,Downhill,"Mr. Anthony has went from a good first book in a downhill slide.Ending with the second book and throughout this book the main ""heroes"" mostly seem to be boy gets boy scenario instead of the usual.Though this may appeal to some,the majority of readers would be more likely to relate to a hero who's after the princess instead of the knight."
3,You might need this,"Depending what kind of sink you have, you might need this plate to cover all the holes when you install theAmerican Standard 2000.101X.002 Ceramix Monoblock Faucet with Speed Connect Pop-Up Drain, Polished Chrome. Plate coordinates well and looks just fine."
4,Happy to Find One,"Because I purchased the TI-35 45 years ago I thought it nearly impossible to find a manual for it. Much to my surprise I found it on Amazon. The manual is in like new condition, in spite of its age, and arrived in a very timely manner. This purchase has breathed new life into my scientific calculator."
5,the best madrugada,"from the first notes, you are drawn in, held close, a voice whispering in your ear...magic.RIP Robert Buras 2007"
1,Mostly cacophonic noise,"The title of this CD has more to do with the coarseness of the band's sound than anything else I can imagine. It ranges from 12 grit - Ouch! little more than irritating noise - to maybe 60 grit - just enough to tease you into believing there is something special to this band if they can just pull it together for a complete set of tracks (they ARE and HAVE - elsewhere). This may be the worst Madrugada CD available. I can appreciate only maybe 3 1/2 tracks, and one being Majesty, is tiring and forgettable after hearing the transcendant live version from the Tralfamadore session. Buy The Deep End, and Industrial Silence, or if you can stand the cost, the Tralfamadore CD. Don't waste your time or money on this one. If you can't play the CD through without quickly jumping over tracks to save yourself the pain, you aren't missing much."
2,limited photos,"Most of the interviews with Ozzy are done over the phone, while you listen to the interview photo's of Ozzy and other band members flash on the screen. That's where the DVD takes a bad turn, because the same photo's flash over and over. I just feel that there should been more behind the scene's photo's or at least different photo's. Also some of the film footage is shot in black and white out of a car window of passing cars and landscape of England that has nothing to do with Ozzy. Most of the contents are well known facts about Ozzy and his life so for the collecting fan this will be a disapointment, but for a new fan it will help them understand a little of Ozzy's history."
5,Great for fans or anyone who just enjoys great satire!,"These 6 episodes are truly representative of the absurdly wacky spirit of the show. There are plenty of ""I see nothing's,"" clever standoffs between Klink and Hogan, even a Col. Crittendon appearance to satisfy any devoted viewer. These videos are ideal for fans or anyone who really appreciates great satire."
3,"AVERAGE, AS I OWN ALL OF HOGANS HEROE'S.",I have most of all the hogan's heroes. on 8 tapes that i watched and taped real good when they were on. and there still the best quality. love this show...never dull. funny. but stupid. I still love them. I watch them when nothing better is on..
3,Sexual repression in Islam,"Ammar abdulhamid attempts to demonstrate how the culture of Islam in Syria is sexually and morally repressive. Through the use of a few simple character narrations, he tells the story of two people raised under the umbrella of Islam and who can find no way to escape from a place of emotional suppression, sexual frustration and fear of physical danger for speaking out. Accompanying these two characters are two saviors - a married couple who have been westernly educated by returned to Syrian to decry the intellectual death they find there.While I would not suggest this book for a fun read, the author is talented and gets his point across clearly and with style."
3,Not that happy!,"I bought this bank for my daughter for Christmas, she was very excited about the ""real atm"" concept. I don't like the fact that you have to manually scroll the paper money into the bank but I could live with that. It wasn't until my daughter was playing with the buttons that I realized that weather you insert money or just press buttons on the bank that it adds money to the balance so you couldn't have an accurate balance. I was disappointed with this becasue kids are naturally going to push buttons and they will be confused with their savings balance. I am planning on returning this item."
5,Great item!!!!!!!,"The only down side i would say is that it isn't like an atm, where you can withdraw money by pressing buttons. In order to withdraw money you need to use the ATM-card key, and open the front door.Other than that, this item is terrific!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!My daughter who is 6 years old, looooves this item.It helps her to keep track of her money. Especially change, it counts it for her, it can be a pain, if you put in tons of penny's but kids love to do that stuff anyhow.Each time you put money in Barbie talks to you too!!!!!!!!!Great, Great, Great, Terrific!!!!!!!!!!!!We are buying one for my niece for Christmas too."
1,Junk Brand,Itasca is a junk brand. My son had a very similar model and from normal walking in less than a year the sole cracked allowing water to go through the heal. I can only imagine how hiking would destroy these in short order.
2,Not so hot,"Always seems like the area under heal fall aparts on these inexpensive hikers, these did the same thing.If you were to wear these hikers just for special occasions they are great, and very comfortable too, no beak-in needed.But don't expect to get a lot of life out of them."
3,"Meh, they're alright.","The color WAS a bit different than anticipated, but I still liked them a lot. I wore them as work boots, and after about 3 months the soles were completely torn. Other than that, they're comfortable, they still look pretty spiffy, and they're inexpensive."
2,"Bad, Bad Leroy Brown.",The shoes themselves? Not bad. The very fact that I too were sent the green (ugly green) ones when I paid for the brown ones? Bad. And it seems to be a problematic thing. Find these where you know you'll get what you pay for.
2,Rocco's gone loco.,"Rocco got fired from the ticket and basically lost his mind.This guy used to hack me off when he was on the radio, now I can hack him off....Hey Rocco, I live in a gated community and drive a Hummer. Oh, and I stole your book."
2,The Village Idiot Grows Up,"One chapter isn't bad reading, if you're a Tickethead. The hockey stories are pretty interesting, also. Unfortunately, his ramblings about the environment are an all-too-painful reminder of the cluelessness that made his Dallas radio show unlistenable. Making a long story short, the village idiot may have grown up, but he didn't get any smarter."
1,"If you like typos and poor editing, this book is for you","I don't think anyone edited this book. After getting through all the misspelled words and run-on sentences, I was convinced that I had died and gone to reading hell. These weren't ramblings; these were incoherent thoughts and meaningless stories that were pretty unrelated. The only saving grace is that this guy's wheels are so far off, that you can't help but laugh at him."
1,Not sized correctly,"My normal size is 6.5. These shoes were way too big - enough excess space in the toe box for two fingers width from the top of my toe. The shoes stated they were 6.5, so, I had to send them back. I really liked the color, so I am still searching."
3,A fun game when it works...,"It's really fun but it crashes a lot and then you lose your place and have to start over. This is when playing on a Mac; don't know if it works better on Windows. It's sometimes really frustrating because the buttons just don't respond, and the documentation is terrible. Good thing it has fun situations and characters and decent (if repetitive) music from the movie. The script is fine, but not really in keeping with the movie."
2,not,"Mouse tracking is horrible.Controls don't work smoothly.Even the menu interface is bad.How can you get this wrong? Some menus are missing a 'return', and Esc does not take you back. Instead, you need to use the delete key above the arrows (not documented, and certainly counterintuitive). Even clicking on the menu items is awkward, with the cheesy pointer and poorly laid out hot spots.Feels more like a something someone had hacked together in their spare time.I hope it's just the result of a poorly executed port from PC to Mac.This was a xmas gift, which after a few minutes of frustration, was thrown in the trash."
3,Fun but frustrating,"My son's a bit young for this game (6) but we have fun playing together. You cannot play this game without knowing the ""G"" key for Context. As other reviewers said you have to use it to grab, climb etc.. They really need a key map as part of help. Crazy that you'd have to research it on the internet to simply play the first ""mission."" I'd pass on the game unless you're really into the story. There are much better games out there."
1,Great for your collection....But doesn't teach!,"I enjoyed the book, because it was a willow book, however it is very hard to read. I found myself skimming it, disappointed there were so many black and white photos. Very wordy, with little substance, if you are looking for a book to increase your knowledge in collecting, this isn't the book. It is the book, though, to add to your collection if you just want more willow ""stuff"". New collectors, stick with the tried and true Gaston book. No value to me, just his research, which I'm sure may be valuable to some. But...to each his own....enjoy!"
2,pretty bad,"I didn't have any problems assembling it, but I do have three main complaints:1) Either the music piece or the spinning piece makes a horrible grinding noise pretty much constantly which I think leads to:2) Sometimes, fully wound, it just stops, perhaps because of the friction produced from point one. But a lot of times, hours later, it starts up again. My twins can sleep through anything, but man, talk about spooky, music boxes just starting up in the middle of the night. I know, I watch too many horror movies.3) The way the part that spins connects to the spinning mechanism, it's possible (and actually pretty likely) that the spinning hook will get a few rotations around before the plush part catches up, which makes the plush part jolt into action and spin a few times really fast.My kids don't have any issue with it, but for the amount of money I paid, I expected something with a bit more quality."
1,How could a company ever produce this??,"We purchased this mobile to go with the matching nursery set. I still can't believe how bad it is. Within a minute the string that attaches the mobile to the device that spins it broke. I decided to use a zip tie to patch it to see if my son even liked it. He did but it has too many design flaws to go with it's poor quality. The tree is just a plush toy with no support, so the limbs sag making the animals hang low. Even with that sagging of the limbs some of the animals get stuck against the holding arm. When that happens you have to give it a nudge to get it spinning again. The mobile is powered by a wind up that lasts about 2 minutes. The music quality is low and after a few days of use the mechanism in the wind up started making constant loud noise.I'm returning this piece of crap before anything else happens. I'm half expecting one of the stuffed animals to suddenly explode."
2,Disappointing,"The animals are cute. Assembly is (for the most part, see below) easy, and it attaches well to our crib.The music is loud and the quality is AWFUL. I suspect it might induce nightmares rather than an actual desire to sleep. I don't expect that we'll use it. Ever. Which is too bad, because it means that we'll have to turn the mobile by hand since the two features do not operate independently. However, as another reviewer noted, one of the animals/palm tree arms is too big to fit past the arm assembly as it turns in any case.The pieces all clipped together easily except for the music box; the hook on the arm attachment has insufficient space to allow the music box portion to slide on. We'll need a zip tie or an s-hook to complete assembly.I feel as though this product did not actually go through a thorough QA process - they missed the part where they tried all of the pieces together."
3,This is not a very functional mobile,"I was happy to receive this from my gift registry since it matched the bedding and the rest of the Jungle Babies items we had in our baby's room.The assembly was easy and quick. The animals are very cute.However, the music is way too loud. Also, after you wind it up - it doesn't last very long. The other disappointment is that the animals are too big - a couple of the toys get stuck when they try to pass the mobile arm. I have to give them a push to get them past the arm.Overall, the mobile looks very good in the crib, but I am disappointed with the functionality of it."
2,Not well built,I was excited to purchase this mobile for my sons crib. Especially because it matched the crib set. I was even more excited that at about 2 months old my son loved the music and stuffed animals. I was angered when at my sons 3 month mark the mechanism that rotates the stuffed animals and makes the music broke. I am very disappointed by the build quality of the mechanical aspect of this mobile.
1,"Fully wound, it only works for 2.5 minutes and is way too loud","We got the Jungle Babies theme for our son's room and generally love all the stuff -- the one thing that lacks is the mobile -- it only lasts 2.5 minutes, and is far too loud for putting a baby to sleep. I wouldn't buy this even for $3."
4,Colorful,"I enjoyed the pictures as much as the story. Some of the story I was just incredibly impressed with but he admits that he didn't take notes on his journey and depended greatly on his memory. I was left wondering how much he got correct in the recalling. It is a true story and it shows some of the better parts of American life. It was heartwarming and wonderful in a lot of ways, but being true it does have heart ache and disappointment but the author doesn't focus on these. It's a good read."
5,A Walk Across America,"My son ordered the book and it was sent out very fast, he couldn't believe that the book came so fast. It came as it was described. The book was new as described. Ordering from Amazon is great! Just sit back and let the fingers do all the work!!! No waiting in line or searching the shelves."
5,Best book I have ever read,"In my life I would say that I have read at least 1,000 books; this one is my all time favorite. You will fall in love with this book and his dog Cooper. This book will stay with you for years. If you are an animal lover expect to do some heavy crying. 19 years after first reading this book it is still far and away above any other. Nothing is even a close second. You will fall in love with his dog Cooper. Has there ever been a better pet? This book will haunt you. You'll read it in one sitting. God Bless Cooper!"
2,"Great theme, bad writing.","Walking across America is quite an endeavour, to write a book about it another. The theme of the book is very interesting, however the style of writing is very dramatic which is a bit tiresome. Jenkins experiences are either rated as total bliss or complete catastrophe, and unfortunately so are the people he meets. The book bleaches in comparison with Krakauers ""Into the Wild"". I did buy the sequel before reading this book and will actually read it because I really like the theme. Hopefully Jenkins has matured on the next section of his walk."
5,a walk across america,wonderful story about a man's remarkable journey with his dog as they walk across America and experience the rekindling of human kindness and that generally folks do really care about each others well being is still alive as they comtinue their journey although some parts are very sad but in all a great book a must readbook .I really enjoyed this book and recommend it highly
1,Boring!,"Reading this book for a book club, I found it incredibly boring and superficial. Peter spends 3 days on the mountain with Homer and writes nothing of depth about this amazing mountain man. Peter's writing is pedestrian. He talks about wanting to discover America and yet only writes about people when someone else directs him to! Someone told him he had to go see Homer the Mountain Man. This was the first people story after 7 weeks of walking. Homer was a character and shared himself with Peter and yet Peter is insensitive and self-absorbed in his responses to Homer. The next story in the book written about actual people is when someone directs him to spend the night in the police station. There Peter talks to a Vietnam Vet. Peter writes that the Vet's stories would awaken a person from a 6 month coma and then writes NOTHING about those conversations. Wasted opportunities. The concept of the book is a great idea, but the writing is juvenile."
2,Amateurish prose,"I believe Mr. Jenkins must have been paid by the exclamation point, so liberal is he with their use. While his story should be interesting to the wanderers among us, his telling of it is so hamfisted that I just couldn't bear to continue. Jenkins needs a harsher editor or better yet, a ghost-writer. This book reads like a high-school senior's lengthy ""personal narrative"" for a college admissions essay. But perhaps I'm being too generous."
1,Suitable for an 8th grade reading list,"I just finished this book and want my money back. I felt like I was expected to write a book report after reading this. If this book is any indication, I won't insult my inteligence by reading any more of his work. He didn't even make it ""across"" the US in any meaningful sense of the term. In THIS book that is. For the entire trip west, you have to buy the sequel. Sounds like someone is milking a story...I do envy him his journey. The entire reason I bought this book was to learn about the logistics of undertaking such a long hike, as I plan on walking from the east coast to the west coast someday. Unfortunately he would rather write of his love affair with his ""forever friend"" and make up lame similes for every little thing he encounters. I would give an example, but I've already given away the book.In my opinion, check your local library or buy it in a quarter bin at a flea market. Any more time or money invested in this book is a waste."
5,A Walk Across America Review,"I really enjoyed the book, A Walk Across America. The book reminded me that life is not about the destination; it is about the journey and the sights you see, the things you do, the memories you create and the people you love. This book reminded me that life is the journey, and in the journey you find out who you are and what you stand for. Peter Jenkins is a great author, and this is a must read!"
4,For people who love people,"This book has it all! Romance, action, death, sickness, family, weather, and friendship that breaks racial barriors. Jenkins and Cooper, his dog, takes you on a wonderful trip that makes you want to do it yourself. I have emailed him and he responded warmly. He walked through my town (I was a only a gleam in my mom's eye when he did), and I find pleasure knowing my town was important enough for an unintintional revelutionary to walk through. Great story!"
3,"Good start, fantastic middle, vague ending","If I were to rate only the first 3/4 of this book, ""Walk"" would recieve 5 stars. The story of Jenkin's efforts to explore the fabric of this country is truly inspiring. The various people he encounters along his journey are the marvelous centerpiece of this grand tale. Unfortunately, Jenkins loses focus toward the conclusion of this book. Although I fully appreciate the inner quest he embarked on, and agree with many of the conclusions he reached, I was really hoping to hear more about the people and places he was discovering, and less about his Christian rebirth.""Across China"" and ""Edge of America"" are much better, in my opinion. Nevertheless, ""Walk"" is an interesting book and worth a read. Check it out and reach your own conclusions."
5,Great!,I see Mike playing all around Michigan. He has a unique mind and his bar songs are for adults. I laugh every time I see him and have turned many friends on to him. His Michigan Man brings genuine tears to my eyes and a lump in my throat. It really should be the state song. Bless you Mike! Thanks for so many hours of happiness! George.
2,"""Attitude Check"" review","I found this album online after having already acquired Mike Ridley's ""One of a kind"" album elsewhere. If it had been the other way around, I would never have come to know the latter, because ""AC"" is ""not good"" - a lot of juvenile & vulgar stuff, very few keepers. Needless to say I was very disappointed, when I know how good an artist Mike is."
3,Bizarre and Sometimes Dull,"I like Ginsberg, but some of these ramblings can be as annoying as some of his poetry. Often hard to comprehend without more background information, Ginsberg comes off as lonely, sad, and using way too many drugs to give himself confidence."
4,Lots of facts,"This book contains lots of facts gleaned from many sources; unfortunately, the story does not flow smoothly because the author frequently jumps around in time and subject. The book's emphasis is on Denver and the big mining towns (places that published newspapers), providing an interesting perspective of what the early settlers did (and endured) to bring their civilization to the Colorado territory during the years 1859-1865."
4,it werks,I got this so I wouldn't have to hack up factory wiring. It probably wouldn't save ya alot of time.
1,Horrible,This was supposed to be a plug and play. And i had to customize to make work. Do not order this item. Not plug and play like seller says!
3,"Thin, but good for the collector","""The Quotations of J.R. Ewing"" was one of a trio of ""Dallas"" books released by Bantam Books and Lorimar Productions in October 1980, to coincide with the new season of the show that fall, as ""Dallas"" was beginning to get very popular. (The other two books were ""The Dallas Family Album"" and ""The Ewings of Dallas"" novelization.) This little guy is a thin paperback, about 50 pages, with a black-and-white photo and a J.R. quote on each page. Each page has a topic heading (like ""Famous Last Words,"" which accompanies the quote, ""You'll see, Mama. You'll be proud of me yet.""). It's not any real substance, just some ""Dallas"" fun!"
5,Great book,"Wonderful wonderful book. Vargas is the master of story telling. He is in the same league as thelatin American greats like Borges, Garcia Marquez. He marvellously constructs a story, shuttling between two time periods. His character of gaugin is tragic at the same time funny. I will read all that Vargas has written. I highly recommend this book as I do every other work of Vargas"
3,paradise - not,just about okay - I didn't find it nearly as good a read as the bad girl or aunt julia etc.
3,"Good story, bad telling.","My book club last night found that we thought the story interesting but the author's writing was confusing in the telling. Also thought the author didn't need to be so specific about the sex content and it was quite obvious that the author hated the Catholic Church. Out of 10 points, we rated it a 3."
3,TRULY DISAPPOINTING,"I love the works of Gauguin and was curious about his ""workers rights"" grandmother when reading a review of this book. But, it is very confusing at first due to Llosa's style of writing. There seems to be a narrator as well as the dialogue from the characters. I got used to it after a while, but didn't care for it at all. Very annoying. Some people have referred to this as second person writing and third person writing. Based on this style, I'll not read any other of Llosa's works.In spite of the lousy writing style, it was interesting to hear more about Gauguin's possible reasons for his use of color, images, locations, etc. And, his grandmother's story was worth hearing about."
2,My purchase,I had a Bad Brains Cd I liked however did not care for this DVD. A lot of people obviously like it though so for a true punk fan this may be for you.
4,Very Very Good,"Awesome,great colors,bright,and great! but only con is that it is a little tight at the thigh but don't let that throw you off these are great!"
2,too tight thigh highs,"Too tight above the knees, and I have skinny legs. I had to give to a friend. I would not recommend buying this unless you are a stick figure."
3,nice but surprisingly itchy.,"i was so excited when i got these, my favorite kind of socks, but about 10 minutes after wearing them i noticed my leg was itchy, i took them off and my entire right leg where the sock was had broke out and was very irritated, im not sure if its the dye in it or just the way they make it but i have to say if you have sensitive skin at all i would not buy these."
5,Cute,Looks just like the picture just keep in mind if your bigger legged they will be more like knee socks.
5,Perfect socks,These socks were the perfect gift for my wife. She wanted a quality product that stayed up and were cute. She tries to wear these every chance she gets.
5,rock the sox!,These are the best socks ever! Amazon is so awesome because I ordered these on monday and received them on wednesday! I even ordered 2 pairs. I have received so many compliments on them because they are incredibly bright. Don't hesitate to buy these..they are a must!
4,Old fashioned Spanish Songs!,I really can't review this album since I downloaded this album for my family who love Bolero (romantic spanish) music. My family are old world and I hope the download to their MP-3 meets with their approval.
5,includes old Syndicate Chapter takes,"particularly the stupendous vocal on ""She's All Right"", a much more exciting version than the Chess box take. So the first half of the disk is the usual best of stuff that all the fans have heard. But the second half is as good to my ears. I wish the compiler would have included ""Oo Wee"" and ""Clouds in my Heart"" (rather than ""Flood"") but it's still a fabulous collection with a good number of hard to find tracks such as ""My Life is Ruined"" and ""Gone to Main Street."" I'd recommend it to anybody, including those with substantial Muddy collections."
4,Sound Advice..and a good read,"I enjoyed this book and have added it to my collection. I would also recommend, ""300 Questions Every LDS Couple Should Ask Before Marriage"" and all of Dr. Laura Schlessinger's books!"
5,The first segment is my favorite.,"To let you know, the animated romance is my artistic specialty and ""Bongo"" is one of them. I love Walt Disney's way of thinking when it comes to romance. I love Dinah Shore's original narration of ""Bongo"" better than that awful Jiminy Cricket's version (and to think ""Arabian Knight"" murdered ""The Thief and the Cobbler""), such as those songs being resung sounded dreadful. This is worth getting."
4,great purchase,My grandson who is three loves this movie. He is really into Mickey and he watches this movie over and over.
3,Nice Little Gem,"I would give this a higher rating if the first segment (""Bongo"") were better. I found it interminably boring and not at all imaginative. I bought the DVD for the ""Mickey and the Beanstalk"" segment, which I had on VHS. Even that featurette could have been improved, however. I found the intrusions in the narrative by Edgar Bergen and the children to be annoying. If they had only been seen at the beginning and end, that would have been alright. Still, for fans of classic Disney animation, I would recommend this title."
4,One of Disneys most whimsical films.,"In this film Disney dishes out two more stories that are very charming. In feature one you meet lovesick Bongo the Bear, and in the second feature Mickey fills Jack's shoes and climbs the beanstalk with Donald and Goofy behind him. The animation is good, and the music is great. A definate must see. I reccomend this film."
4,Fun and Fancy Free,"My son loves this DVD very much. He is only 2, I don't think he understands the whole stories, but he loves those characters."
3,Fun and Fancy Free,"The animation and story aspects of Fun and Fancy Free are as good as I remember them being, except for the annoying snippets of a ventriloquist and his two dummies inserted into the Mickey and the Beanstock segment of the film. The version I remember as a kid had Ward Kimball (the voice similar to Winnie the Pooh) narrating, with no inserts of live action. All in all, not bad, except for all the trailers in the beginning you can't skip."
2,Not the best,A Disney movie with Mickey Mouse on the cover..... I thought you couldn't go wrong. I was wrong. This movie was not what I expected or hoped for. It was pretty lame. Even my young kids were disappointed.
1,forced to watch commercials,i'm with vince o'sullivan. disney FORCES you to watch their stinking commercials BEFORE you can watch your movie because they're a bunch greedy suits.
1,Splice out the Edgar Bergan interruptions and reissue the film!,"Maybe he was popular at the time, but the narration interruptions by Edgar Bergan and his scary puppets are horribly annoying. My 3 year old kids can't watch this video because they start screaming that the TV is broken every time the video cuts from the animated story to the live action black and white footage of Edgar bergan explaining the story to his evil-looking puppets and annoying child actor assistant. By the same token they can't stand the stupid puppet sequences in Caillou videos (which are not present on the actual PBS airings of Caillou).Disney should re-issue a new version of this DVD with all of the Edgar Bergan/evil puppet sequences edited out."
2,Fun And Fancy Free by Walt Disney,Very disappointing. Neither the three year old nor I liked this. I regret spending my precious dollars on this program.
5,Love it,I love this movie. A bit old school but brings back childhood memories. Share it with the new generation of kids!
2,concerning messages to our youth,"Although the granddaughter wants to watch Mickey- she looses interest before Mickey even makes an appearance. And while there are good messages about worrying less- it is concerning to watch the bears smack each other around -all in the name of love. Domestic violence is difficult enough for children to endure without the confusing message that it really is a show of love. If you are looking for a Mickey Mouse tape for your child or grandchild, I would pick something else."
2,Where is the Ward Kimball Naration?,"The Mickey and the Beanstalk portion of the DVD is fine, except for the fact that the live action keeps popping in. While this is all fine and well for those with nostalgia for that type of thing, it absolutely ruins the flow of the movie. A much better version (the version I remember seeing) had Ward Kimball narating. There were no interuptions in the animation and it flowed a lot better. Unfortunately, there is no DVD out there with the Ward Kimball naration, so if you love the animation like I do, you're kinda stuck."
2,Not what I was expecting,"This is not the Mickey and The Beanstalk that I remember -- this one included creepy marionette howdy doody-ish puppets live action that my toddler was afraid of! I was even slightly skeeved by the puppets, and seriously, why was this little girl alone at a party with an adult male puppet weirdo?Ok anyway -- whenever the live action sequences came on (which is pretty often) my kid would cry MICKEY! MORE MICKEY! We had to do a lot of fast-forwarding. Definitely not worth the 1.99 download."
3,Fun & Fancy Free - Vintage Disney Animation,"This 10th Disney classic packs in 2 stories -- Bongo and Mickey and the Beanstalk. The movie is pure Disney animation in its classic style. Sure to warm the youngest hearts, but may cause nausea in those who do not like non-stopping music. It is, nonetheless, a classic, and deserves a place in every collector's shelf. **Plus! The DVD brings added segments as a bonus. An excellent deal!"
2,not a very good C book,"well, this book has proven handy for reference and review, but i would certainly NOT recommend it. the author repeatedly used obscure functions(imho) that were prone to bugs, and he introduced totally new concepts in breif 10-word sentences only to use them all-too-frequently in most examples following. yes, im a 16 year-old, shift-key-fearing mexican, but i've seen good code, and mr.bacon's code doesn't fool me. if you want to take full advantage of this book, read the ENTIRE THING in one sitting so every little concept sticks with you throughout, and don't you dare approach a computer without reading a book that emphasizes on structure, organization, and clean, effective code first"
5,An EXCELLENT text on C/UNIX for programmers of all levels!,"Overall a VERY nice book, this is NOT hard reading. I am definitely impressed. The text is very readable, and the concepts come across crystal clear. The number and content of the examples are very appropriate, and the performance tips, tips of the trade, pitfalls, etc. are VERY insightful...I would recommend this book to ANYONE who is or is thinking about programming C and/or running UNIX!"
4,It was worth the cash,"I enjoyed it, I have read some of the largest advanced books out there on the subject, and this book still taught me things I hadn't thought of."
5,Please don't pay attention to the other reviews... this is great!,This supplement is perfect for my needs and was a very nice switch from the 300mg I have been taking... this is a much better dose for everyday adaptogenic purposes.Very clean extract. Highly recommended.
4,A definite increase in work capacity,"This has subtle effects, but the effects are most definitely there. I feel able to go from 10 AM to 9 PM without issues when I take this, yet I do not feel as if I am on something. I recommend giving this a try in the very least.I also notice that I do not feel depression from the weather being poor when I take this."
1,awful,"this product did nothing for me. what a hoax!! wouldn't recomend it, no way. very sorry I bought it in the first place."
2,How could this be 500 MG???,"I'm wondering if the dosage on this capsule is REALLY correct. The capsule does zip -- you get a vague energy buzz, but nothing sensational or really ""rhodiola"" feeling. This is more like caffeine. I am sure that either the processing of this herb is off base, or they have included some other ingredient that flavors the way it feels when you take it. Not at all like the quality Rhodiola from Siberia."
2,Strangely Low Powered for Such A High MG Dose,"This product must have very low percentages of active ingredients. I don't get much effect from it, despite the fact that it is two or three times ""stronger"" by MG dose than the Swedish product I normally take. I'm very surprised. Was expecting a huge boost of Rhodiola -- not much happened."
1,"16 Singing Men, ""Carols of Christmas""","I would recommend this CD even though it is remastered from vinyl. The original ""Master"" tape has been lost. In 1996 I recorded a DAT tape for Dick Anthony that contained this Zondervan vinyl album. Mr. Anthony used this DAT for his remaster onto CD. The DAT tape I made was not well done and the quality of this reissue CD reflects the surface noise that is prevalent on vinyl(I never intended the DAT to be used as a master). The song ""Star and Septer"" is particularly noisy. The rest of the songs are OK but there is still the occasional ""tic"" from the vinyl. I have over 800 Christmas LP's in my personal collection. I would rate this CD/Album number one. The a cappella music that was crated by the 16 Singing Men is some of the finest.Jim Guild"
5,Great idea ... especially useful for us during teething!,"When my 5-month-old started teething, my father-in-law tried to put crushed ice in a Zip-loc bag so she'd have something to chomp on (she wasn't a fan of chilled teethers). We started using cold fruit to soothe her gums, but even without teeth she managed to break of chunks and I'd have to pry open her mouth to fish out the pieces. This simple little plastic and mesh device has worked very well for us. At first we used to fill it with crushed ice, but then started putting fruits or veggies in (as mentioned on the packaging) and it works great for that as well. We even take it with us to restaurants so she can chew on pieces of fruit. I like that she can hold onto it herself and I don't have to worry about her choking (there's no way she could fit anything but the tip of the mesh in her mouth). I have had such good luck with this product that I'm already stocking up on them to give to girlfriends as shower gifts."
4,How to clean,Use a waterpik to clean. It is helpful for your gums and teeth and makes cleaning the feeder easy too.
5,Best baby snacking product!,"I absolutely LOVE this thing!! I was always afraid of feeding my son solids without mashing them to death for fear of him choking. I especially wasnt comfortable giving him hard treats like teething biscuits or cookies. This thing is wonderful, I was able to give him those snacks and fruit and more with out having to worry about choking. It was also great for travel when he was teething, on the airplane we couldnt take fruits and stuff (international flights) but they did give us some ice and he would chomp away at the ice and it made his gums feel a lot better."
1,I'd save your money...,"This item seems like a good idea, but after purchasing two I feel that we've fallen victim to ""new parent baby marketing"". Our baby wasn't interested at all in sucking on anything in it. She woudln't even go for fruits that we knew she loved. I'm guessing the mesh is too distracting or annoying to them(?) She would just shake it around, bang it, or throw it. Also, it's a total pain to clean it. The netting never gets clean in the dishwasher.Save your money on this one."
1,my daughter can't get her mouth around it,I tried this after reading the great reviews. My 10 month old daughter never sucks on the mesh part but just uses the handle as a teether. Even when she puts her mouth to the mesh - she just sucks on the mesh but not at the food inside.Needless to say I am dissappointed...
1,It stinks!!!,"I think the idea is great, but obviously the person that created it never had to clean a banana from it!!! I spent 2 hours and there were still places that it was impossible to clean. I don't want to give my daughter a fruit in something that may have bacteria from the previous fruit that was placed in it.... I used it just once and never again. It is impossible to have the baby safe feeder 100% clean with a fruit like a banana."
5,Love the Baby Safe Feeder,"The first time I gave my little Kayla (6 months at the time)a peach in the safe feeder I loved it as much as she did. She enjoyed the peach and I enjoyed the fact of knowing that she wouldn't bite off more than she could chew. We had it for about three weeks when we went out on an outing and she lost it. I continued to give her fruit but very leary that she would choke.I just purchased another one and I will consider stocking up on them just incase we should lose this one too. I am truly grateful to the person who invented this product.I only wished that I had thought about it first, I'm sure he has sold thousands and will continue to do well with this product.Eternally a grateful Nana.."
4,keeps little one occupied,"i bought this for my 6 mo old who we thought was teething. turns out at 8 mos there are still no teeth. we've only put fruit (banana, cantaloupe) in the feeder and he has so far liked the sensation that he's ""eating"" something. its easy for him to grip and find the right end to put in his mouth.its a little hard to clean and you really have to soak it even if you wash it right away. but other than that it serves its purpose- the replacements are a little pricey but i can't imagine we will go thru too many of them."
5,I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1,Santa brought this for my son. Hunter is 6 months old and wants to eat more than baby food!! He bit off a big hunk of a teething biscuit as well as a zwieback toast. He is teething right now too. I put grapes in it yesterday and he just went to town on them. The bananas are a little hard to clean out but that is why they sell replacement netting. I wish they had this product out 5 years ago when my daughter was a baby
3,Good idea but baby is not crazy about it.,"I got this thinking that is would be a great product for a baby just learning to mash and chew solids. My daughter had a different opinion, though! We offered it to her many times over the course of a month before we finally gave up and packed it away. It didn't seem to matter what we put in it. She wouldn't take anything from it. . .except ice cubes when she was teething. And, this is a really expensive teething ring if you ask me! I think that part of the problem was that it took her a lot of work to get much food out of it. The mesh holes seem to be a bit small. It would have been nice if we could have bought replacement bags with slightly larger holes for an older baby. For us, it was a great product in theory, but it just didn't work out."
5,Wonderful Product!!!,"For babies who like to throw things like this across the room (great fun), try hooking it on strollers and infant seats with plastic links like the ones used for rattles and toys. This is useful when traveling, or when eating in a restaraunt.For a great treat during warmer months, try placing a frozen peach slice inside the mesh bag! It's like a popsicle for baby! This product is highly recommended!!"
3,Pro's and Con's,"It reduces my fear of baby choking, good with ice, easy to use. Also, I felt it taught my 6 mo. baby to self feed before she was really interested in picking up food.But, I'm only giving it three stars... why so expensive? Why is that huge seam in the middle of the net that traps all the food? Surely they could have made a netting without that seam. My girl didn't seem to use it for very long - only until she could pick up the food herself. Lastly, it is very hard to clean. Never put bananas in it - GROSS!"
1,Mom,The idea of this product is great and that is why I bought it. It has one major problem. To get it clean again is almost impossible. I used it first with a banana and since I could not get all of the banana out of the mesh I ended up tossing it. It came with an extra mesh and I used an apple in that. It met with the same fate.
4,Great product,"I bought this for my 6 month old who is very restless in her highchair. She was very content with this product. The first time I used it with bananas and she loved it. I want to provide healthy food for my baby and this helps me out alot. Not to mention without the worry of a choking hazard. I would have rated this product with 5 stars, but it is a pain in the neck to clean. Food does get stuck in it and takes quite a bit of work to get out. However, I will take the advise of the other comment and buy more bag refills."
4,We love it!,"My daughter is ten months old and loves the Baby Safe Feeder. She has been using it for five months and it has been a life-saver. We bought a bunch of replacement bags, and I think they are a little expensive, but still worth the money. We have two bags that we use just for foods that stain. She started out with softer foods like bananas and kiwi. Now that she is older, she can eat those foods on her own, but I still love the Baby Safe Feeder for carrots, pears, and strawberries. I wash it in the dishwasher so I don't have to worry about germs. I usually put her in her high chair to use it, because the juice leaks all over. It has been great to take to restaurants. She loves to try new foods, and usually ends up with some vegetables from Mom and Dad's salads. Overall this is a great product!"
2,"Messy, hard to clean, and hard to use","While I don't share everyone elses enthusiasm about this product, I will say that my 5 month old 'liked' it. I gave two stars instead of one only for that reason. I can't understand how people are able to clean this thing. I scrubbed it, put it in the dishwasher, used a brissle brush, but it took forever to clean. One thing is for sure, if you buy this, don't use the peel on foods as suggested. I had a little more luck cleaning this when I peeled the grapes (which you'll see isn't really that hard, apples and pears. Bananas I'll never use again, they are virtually impossible to get out of the inside mesh area by the ring. Also, when my baby was done, he was soaked from all the juice and sooo sticky. On the positive, he did seem to have fun at first. Up until the food was small and it kept going up to the top where he couldn't put his mouth around it.Good luck to those who buy this, maybe you'll have better luck like the other reviewers."
2,A little frustrated with this product...,"I was SO excited to get this feeder for my 8 month old. I've tried using it several times and he will not put it past his lips! I've tried to 'help' him get started eating from it, but he won't bite! The reason is the mesh bag. He doesn't like the feel of it. He is that way with foods that are not blended smooth enough as well.I would love for him to use it, but I'm not sure what to do! Maybe I will just rely on the food grinder from now on.Great idea though!"
1,"He didn't ""get it""","Sorry, but this product was a waste of money. My son hated it. He just ""didn't get it"". He used it as a toy and threw it on the floor every time I offered it to him. I just gave up! He has been eating fresh fruits and vegetables since he was 9 months old without the use of this unnecessary product. You will have to wean your child off this gadget eventually so why even bother?"
1,Nice concept,"My daughter hated this item. She only decided she liked it after she has almost a full mouth of teeth. What a waste. So if you have a finicky child like mine who is sensitive to new tastes and textures, save your money and forget this product."
4,not too bad,"I didn't find it too dificult to clean as others commented. It's good for babies over 6 months but one must understand that the baby might throw it away (sometimes very far away) and then all the food is gone. It's a cheap item and the baby might have fun as mine did. When they get a bit older and holding things for longer, it is very handy to leave the baby busy eating some fruit, for example."
4,great product for small babies!,"I got this for my 4 month old to introduce her to foods. It's nice because you dont have to supervise constantly while they are eating. It is hard to clean though, when using it with bananas, and also the bad stains easy. Once my baby was a little older, she didn't like to use this. So now we just watch her well while she eats with out the baby safe feeder. Great product for just starting out! Refill bags are expensive though."
2,"I'm sold, baby's not!","I saw it in a catalog, but didn't want to spend the money until a friend who's the mother of twins got one and came to work with raves about this great thing she'd just bought. I picked one up since I'm paranoid about feeding the bambino anything that might migrate to the wrong tube. Much to my dismay, my son hates it! No matter what we put in there, he scrunches up his little face and pitches the feeder on the floor. We think it may be the texture of the mesh. Anyway, I still think it's a great idea, but my son refuses to be convinced!"
4,Great Product!,"I bought this for my son when he was about 6 months old after reading soo many great reviews. I admit, I was very skeptical.. it looked like such a pain to clean! But my son really loves it so it is definately worth the effort it takes to wash. He is teething and I think this is really soothing for those little gums. It is also great for taking along when we eat out as we can always get some fruit from the salad bar, and it keeps him entertained so we can actually eat! The only drawback is the cleaning.. it really does take some effort to get all the food out of it.. especially banana. The feeder has a very thick seam and a ridge around the green part that trap bits of food. I have been using a toothbrush to clean it, but if anyone has some tips to share to make it easier I'd love to hear them!"
4,Baby loves it!,I just recently received this item and my son loves it. He tried it with bananas first and was hooked. He's six months old and I think he loves being able to feed himself at times. I haven't had any trouble keeping it clean so far. I absolutely recommend it.
2,"Too little, too late?","I bought this for my son when he was 8 months old. At that time, he had just started chewing on teething biscuits and I wanted to give him a little more variety in his diet. I think we used it twice before we decided it was too much work. It is a great idea, but takes forever to clean the food out the the bag and my son was fed up with the amount of work he had to put into getting swallow of food. Maybe if we had tried it when he was just being introduced to fruits and veggies this would have worked, but I've decided it was just a huge waste of money for us."
1,"loved it at first, but now am upset","My sister-in-law bought this for me, and it was a lifesaver! My son stayed quiet while I cooked dinner. However, he's 10 months old, and likes to throw things on the floor. The green top breaks very easily, and my son has just broken the third top. I can't keep buying replacements for it--it's getting too expensive. The idea is excellent, but the product quality stinks, and I'm not buying another replacement, nor am I going to encourage any of my pregnant family or friends to buy it."
5,The BEST teether out there!,"We love our Baby Safe Feeder! I put frozen strawberries in it when she is teething and it works miracles. Anything that makes my girl feel better when she is teething is worth a million bucks to me, and I love the security and peace of mind we get from it. And having a baby girl that smells like fresh strawberries is pretty cool too! Beyond the teething aspect, it's a great way to expose your baby to flavors and textures you would otherwise have to avoid for safety reasons. As a new mom I am paranoid enough- having one less thing to worry about is priceless. Get TWO!!"
3,Neat contraption but awful to clean,"Yes..I agree with the rest of the reviews, this is an incredible invention and wonderful for all kinds of foods. However, I'd be concerned about the food that we can't seem, no matter what we use to clean (toothbrush, bottle brush, dishwasher) that some food gets lodged in the seam of the bag and the green ring. That can't be healthy and am guessing depending on types of food, possibly dangerous re; salmonella.I think 'Dad' needs to revise the layout and make the green ring detachable from the mesh ring, supposedly attaching mesh to rubber ring and then to green ring similar to a food processor or baby food blender. You'd have to keep buying the bag replacements instead of using the same one over with old food stuck in grooves. Good for the manufacturer, terrible for us the consumer. Back to the drawing boards Dad."
1,Doesn't Teach Baby to Eat Safely!,"Unless your child has a feeding issue that prevents thenm from eating solids this is a waste of money. My son started to eat solids that were not pured before he even had teeth, ask your pediatrician, they can tell you that until your child has molars that chew with their gums. First he started with cheerios, they will melt in your babies mouth, and yes he did gaga little, but a nurse told me that is normal and part of the process of learnign to eat. When he mastered that I introduced other foods. To make it safe I just cut his food up into tiny pieces (about the size of a cheerio). He only has 4 teeth now at 12 monthes old but he eats what we eat, just cut up (the pieces can be larger now)."
2,i hope i didnt waste my money,"i believe this is a good product but its not suitable for my 14 month old daughter. she screams when i show it to her and wants all her fruits in hand to chew on her own. she has 4 teeth up top and 2 on bottom. since she was younger, she has been excellent about not swallowing what she knows wont fit down her throat. i plan to use the feeder with my next baby due in 2 weeks as soon as he is ready to use it and hope he favors it."
1,Possible Choking hazard?,I have a hard time believing that the baby would not choke on this. They are putting the mesh bag in their mouths and they could get that mesh bag back far enough to choke themselves. They do not have the knowledge yet to know to pull it out. Not sold on these!!!!
3,Baby Safe Replacement Mesh,"I only rate it a 3 because I haven't tried it yet myself. However, I did look up the product and found that there are Baby Safe Feeder Replacement bags. They come 4 per package, are top rack dishwasher safe (or utensil basket). They cost around 7.99This should help in alleviating the frustration some have expressed regarding the cleaning process."
1,Will melt if slips through top rack of dishwasher,"I never used this with my son because when I attempted to wash it before use, it slipped through the top rack of the dishwasher (the recommended washing spot) and the plastic then melted. Be very careful if you clean this in the dishwasher!"
2,"Great idea, but...","This product is a really good idea, but be warned that it's difficult to clean. Bits of food get trapped in the seams of the mesh bag and near the plastic ring. I scrub using a short-bristle brush as recommended, soak and rinse under hot water repeatedly and still can't get it completely clean. Stains are one thing, but pieces of food will grow bacteria. I worry how safe that is to give to a baby. If the manufacturer can fix the problem, this would be a must-have product."
1,My baby refuses it!,"I don't really know if this thing works or not because my 8 mo old refuses to have anything to do with it. Keep in mind that she puts anything & everything in her mouth, will eat any food I try to feed her & is currently teething. It seems like a great idea for that short transition period between mush & solids. This particular one appealed to me because it's not dyed & it's made in the USA. As to whether or not it works? I will never know!"
2,Baby broke cap on second use,"The feeder works fine, though the netting does get nasty from banana and is really hard to get clean after baby eats banana in it.However, my baby broke the green part of the cap just by dropping the feeder on the wood floor - the SECOND time she used it.It has a crack in it now that has a sharp edge, so it is no longer safe for her to use. The design was fine but turned out not to be worth my $5."
2,Mesh fell apart after a month,"It was okay while it lasted but then the mesh started unraveling at the seams. I like the concept of this but in practical use, my 7.5 month old wasn't thrilled about using this. The handle is a bit heavy and I wondered why they couldn't make it a little lighter to hold. My baby ends up holding onto the mesh part of this b/c the handle is too heavy for her. Eating out of this does get really messy but that's going to happen any time babies try to feed themselves. In comparison to the Munchkin Feeder I bought, this is nice in that the handle screw off but the Munchkin feeder is much more durable and the mesh is easier to clean."
4,Just avoid fruits that stain...,"The bag is a little tricky to clean (thanks for the oxyclean tip, Billy Mays RIP!)...otherwise, this thing is fantastic! Ok, so--it makes a mess...or do I just have a messy baby??? She winds up with fruit all over her, and what did I throw in it tonight? BLUEBERRIES, brilliant, just brilliant. Especially since she was wearing our favorite outfit. Maybe the Oxyclean will be doing double duty tonight?The handle is perfect for their little hands, the thing freezes to keep the fruit/veggies cold...and it's good for a ""snacker"" on the go. When we run errands, I always have chunks of frozen fruit with us to throw in and give her when hungry. Also, a pacifier attacher-thing also works for this, so you can ensure it isn't being thrown across the car/store/etc.I wouldn't do avocados in it though...they are too thick and won't go thru the bag. Too bad, my little one loves avocados!"
5,Great Product,"My baby loves this feeder. She just turned 6 months old and the baby feeder can keep her busy and satisfied, when other items such as, teethers and blankies, get old. In order to help me clean it, I bought a small inexpensive toothbrush. It really helps the cleaning process. So I would definitely recommend it."
4,Gastric Memoir,"Think of this short piece more as a culinary review than a work of philosophy or fiction or even memoir. Baudelaire speaks to the pros and cons of both Wine and Hashish as well as the impact of both on the body. In addition, he dabbles in satire and social insight, giving the reader a wonderful view of his life, opinions and experiences."
3,"""Godzilla, King of the Monsters"" had some good moments.","I enjoyed reading the book, but found parts of it, especially towards the end to be a bit boring. I also found the book to be a bit childish even for kids. The book described Godzilla trampling Tokyo well and additionally described Godzilla's feelings well. The ending was very disapointing. Instead of killing Godzilla or just trying to do something to him, the people decide it is unjust, and Godzilla swims away, leaving only one conclusion, he will strike again. I think children, especially children that are Big Daddy ""G"" fans should enjoy this, but I don't recommend it to many adults or hardcore adults Godzilla fans because they would find the book to be very childish, with points that are unrealistic and don't add up."
3,"Godzilla, King of the Monsters retold for the young reader.","This may be a kinder, gentler Godzilla tale, one that retells segments of the first film (sans Raymond Burr) from the perspective of a group of children, but it is slow and uneven. The second book in the series - Godzilla Invades America - is somewhat of an improvement and closer in tone to the latter day kiddie matinee Godzilla films than this premiere is. There is the usual amount of city stomping, but no one is seriously hurt and a predominantly sympathetic tone for Godzilla will keep the bad dreams away. Recommended for the monster loving youngster."
2,Godzilla lite,"This one was pretty much written for the younger crowd, from 9-15. Older readers wanting Godzilla books should check out the excellent novels ""Godzilla Returns"" and ""Godzilla 2000"" by Marc Cerasini."
2,Flavorless Funk,"I have thousands of funk albums. This one is boring-- with a few exceptions, the more ""obscure"" tracks follow the formula without any inspiration (I 'm waiting to see, but imagine the first 2 in this series will be a little better?) Ho Humm/off to bed...."
2,Think twice before buying!,"I bought this CD on the recommendation of the reviews here on Amazon.com. But I regret the purchase. I buy CD's both to teach my kids new songs and to keep them quiet in the car. We have all of these songs on several different albums, so the songs on this album, ""classic"" they may be, were not interesting enough to grab the attention of my kids--two and four. The ""young artists"" in this album do not have the clearest articulation, so I do not know how much a child can learn from this album, if he/she does not know the songs already. Sure it is cute to hear little kids sing, but I suggest one thinks carefully before making this purchase."
5,Fabulous CD - Excellent for the Car,I bought this cd 3 years ago when my first child was 1 1/2. He loved it. He loved to sing along with the kids on the cd. He laughed when they laughed! I pulled it out the other day for my second son who is now two. He also loves it. He wants to hear it all the time! It was definitely a great investment for me!
5,Toddlers Sing,"I purchased this title for my grandson at age 20 months. When we travel he listens to it and is mesmerized. He has many other tapes, but this is the one that he prefers. We have worn out one tape and I am purchasing another. At 2 1/2 now, he is randomly singing songs from the tape when he plays, especially Twinkle, twinkle; itsy bitsy spider; and ring around the rosie."
2,Very Annoying,"I found this cd, and the toddlers sing rock cd, highly annoying. My daughter was not very enthusiastic about it either since it lacks the musicality she is used to in her other cds."
2,Toddlers Sing,"I purchased this tape on the reviews of others, but was very disappointed. While the children are cute, their english is horrible. I never play this tape for my son, as I do not want to expose him to the ""baby talk"" and incorrect pronunciation."
5,My King over This Threshhold,"Denzel Washington's charismatic performance and amazing accent once again has reiterated how incredibly talented he is. The movie is fiery, racsist, violent, full of gritty realism, and he carries his acting role superbly as usual. I have seen 95% of all his movies and in each and every one of them, he becomes the character. Without a doubt I claim him as the VERY BEST AFRICAN AMERICAN ACTOR in Hollywood."
4,Received in time for Christmas.,"It was delivered on time for Christmas, which I was afraid it wasn't going to be because I purchased it the week of Christmas. However, the DVD was moving around in the case before I opened it. I don't know if it was during shipment or what, but at some point the part that clicks the DVD into place had broken. Thankfully, it was not scratched. No complaint's because I'm sure it wasn't intentionally done."
2,"a waste of time,","I am very disapponted with this movie. The acting was so so, plot was weak, and action scenes weren't so good either. Don't waste your time on this movie."
4,paralisis cerebral,"paralisis cerebral,concecuencias,trastornos producidos a nivel de hipotalamo,pubertad precoz,columna vertebral,todo lo relacionado en general."
2,Not what I expected,"I returned mine. The ring is very large...taking up the entire length of my finger between my middle and end knuckle. Some people can carry this look off but it is not a good look for a smallish person like me. Also, the ""stone"" part looks like enamel rather than the cool, unique stone that I thought it was going to look like. The color is beautiful but is lacks the depth and variety that would make it look like a true natural stone."
4,Good Italian rock,the best Italian rock band I know I've heard. Favorite trackis the first one. Check it out for yourself.
4,7 Thinks It's Heaven...,"This book is a collection of 12 chapters from various books that might interest a seven year old---like a music sampler. None offer a complete story, but they were meaty enough for my seven year old daughter to want to pursue reading some of the books. A good way to introduce a child to some new material. I wasn't too excited about the idea of paying for excerpts, but the reader appreciated the opportunity to ""look before she bought""!"
2,Lo-Tek,"Hi-Tek has never been a personal favorite of mine, but I did enjoy his work on Blackstar and with Mos Def. He's just not the type of producer who puts out the bangin' hip hop beats I prefer. Hi-Teknology only proves this further. The majority of the beats featured are weak, dull, soft, whatever you want to call them. Not to say I want everything to be Rasco-esque, but I get bored of those Common-type beats that don't make your head nod even a little bit. I'm starting to get the impression that Hi-Tek is a one trick pony who is saving all of his better beats for future projects. Hi-Teknology comes off as being very incomplete."
4,4 1/2 actually,"His new cd sounded kinda wack at the begining, but after i started listening to it for a while i couldnt stop. Not that its better than reflection, its pretty good though. i would actually give it four and half."
4,Very Solid Offering From Hi-Tek,"Hi-Teknology is not the gem that Train Of Thought was, but nonetheless, this is a very solid album and fans who liked Hi-Tek's previous work will not be disappointed. The album's jewel is The Sun God w/ Common, which is at the beginning, but that does not mean that the rest of the album is not worth listening to. Get Back II w/Talib Kweli, Breakin' Bread, Round & Round, Get Ta Steppin w/ Mos Def and Vinia Mojica, Suddenly(a gem with Mood) and The Illest It Gets(Buckshot rips it) are all tracks that are worth checking for. Even if this album is not as groundbreaking as Hi-Tek's other work, he should still be heralded for being one of the most consistent producers in hip-hop."
4,Very nice romantic story,"Lucille runs a secretarial agency. She's all set to go to Paris, but first she has to meet with one troublesome client. It seems the professor just can't keep a secretary.Lucille soon sees why when she meets him. He's impossible. But her professional streak demands that she finish the job before joining her aunt and fiancee in Paris. But once she gets there, she has to face her doubts about her relationship and her future.An old-fashioned story, one that would appeal to fans of D E Stevenson. I really enjoyed it, but felt that Lucille's character was a little inconsistent over the course of the story. Lots of entertaining secondary characters and a satisfying resolution.CMB"
5,Excellent Book!,This book is very detailed but the author does a fabulous job of defending the Pre-Tribulation/Pre-Millenial view! I highly recommend it!
3,Fast delivery,"This could be a five star, except that I am disappointed because I cannot see the page number in which I am reading, like my other amazon purchased book. I bought this book for a college requirement class and don't know what page I am in compared to the class"
3,Not for casual reading,This book is for a bible student or scholar. The concepts are somewhat difficult to comprehend and seem to run together.
4,very deep book,"This is a very deep book for the study of the end times. In no way get this mixed up with a novel type book. This is for serious study. The only downside is that this book uses many many quotes from others, and personally I don't care for that style. However still probably one of the best books out there on the end times."
2,The limit of my ability to read!,"I bought THINGS TO COME a long time ago. I may still have it. For me the poor layman it surpasses my ability to endure. I read 110 pages of it and quit! I did learn that my style of Bible interpretation was the literal-historical interpretation. While people like Benny Hinn, who I have observed trying to teach the Bible is allegorical. I used one chapter which identifies the players in Ezekiel 38 and 39. Eveyone's books just say that Russia will invade Israel. But I remember him call ""Gomer"" there Germany. So, I just described Ezekiel 38 based on that book chapter as the nations of the world invading Israel to go to war with Jesus Christ in armageddon-Russia, the Germans and EU and the Arabs. I remember some complicated teachings about God's covneants with Isreal and Abraham. Too much for me. I just used it as sort of a reference book to look some things up in. My fomer P Chem prof, Dr. Thompson actually looks like Dwight Pentecost-how amusing!"
2,dry and disappointing,"This is largely disappointing, if only because the bulk of the writing is extremely dry and poorly constructed. As an English major I may be an elitist, but I expect professors to be able to write at least as well as I do. One notable exception to an otherwise bland collection is Suszanne McCorkle's ""American Hero Meets Terrorist,"" an essay that tries hard to introduce relevance to a volume that's otherwise mired in the 1980s."
5,RAF Flies Again,"This fabulous paperback, only 64 pages, from the Ian Allan ABC series shows that there was no shortage of brilliant aircraft designers and builders in Britain during the Second World War. The classic Supermarine Spitfire, the rugged Hawker Hurricane, the mammoth Short Sunderland, the whispering death Bristol Beaufighter, not to mention the Avro Lancaster, the de Havilland Mosquito and Gloster Meteor. There are over 2 dozen major types and over 3 dozen minor types such as the well loved de Havilland Tiger Moth and the famous trainer Miles Magister. The brief write ups of each aircraft can stand on their own and can be read over and over again to celebrate the efforts of a small country in a big war. The black and white archival photographs are splendid as is the author's descriptions."
5,QUALITY IS EVIDENT; MADE IN USA,"This product represents what the term heavy duty means. I broke a shovel which was owned by my grandfather and as I needed a replacement, I looked at those in the local hardware stores. I could not justify purchasing the chinese made shovels which cost around 20-25 dollars. I found this shovel when I googled american made shovel and have been very pleased. This is a tool which I could well see passing down to my children. Since purchasing this item, I have purchased several other bully tools products. I do not think that I would purchase any other brand."
1,BSA,"(...) He blames BSA for the demise of his true love, Triumph. Basically he would be quite happy if BSA had not made anything more sophisticated than the A10. Save your money and buy a decent book on BSAs!!!!!"
2,Not described properly,Would of been better if they put the years the harness honored Did not fit my Truck Had to return item
4,"So cute, but a little small","This teddy is adorable. The sheer front and applique are very sexy, and the curve of the side panels provides a slimming effect. The back is almost bare -- just a few slim straps to hold the front panel together. The price was good, but the teddy seems to run quite small. I liked it so much that I would order a larger size, but the size options are quite limited."
3,pretty...but....,"I loved the appliqué details of this and overall design but it wasn't long enough for me and I'm only 5'4, so it's not like I'm tall or anything. I also wish the boob part covered as wide as shown in the picture. Basically, this is going back."
1,Do not fit babysafe feeder!,These did not fit the original Babysafe Feeders unlike the misleading item title and description. They are the Sassy brand. They are too small and do not fit. Very disappointed!
2,Too small,Theses replacement bags are too small for Sassy teething feeder. They don't match at all. Can't use them on feeder.
1,Does not fit baby safe feeder!,This product is advertised as refills for the Baby Safe Feeder but they are too big. Waste of money. I had to order the original replacement bags from the Baby Safe website. Don't waste your money!
4,useful product,"These replacement bags are well made. I have not actually had to replace the bag yet, because the bags are much sturdier than I thought they would be and because I'm not squeamish about discoloration because I'm so persnickety about cleaning that I feel confident that any staining that is left is merely discoloration and nothing to be concerned about. But, if you are squeamish, buy these replacement bags."
2,not a fan,"I bought these and the feeder at the sametime. My daughter hated it! Cleaning bananas out of these are impossible. If you REALLY want these, go to Babies-R-US....I think they are cheaper. But save your money!!"
4,great product,I couldnt wait to feed my child real food so i bought this it is great to put food in. The juices and small pieces come right through great. It works the best with bananas. The only thing it is hard to clean and keep clean i had to buy these refills due to the mesh refills are hard to clean.copy and paist this video to check it out in action[...]
2,Changed formula is sickening sweet,"I have been buying this brand of sugar-free DGL for a long time. I am extremely disappointed that they have recently changed the formula so that these tablets are now sickening sweet and leave an aftertaste similar to that of regular table sugar. To be clear, the principal ingredient, deglycyrrhizinated licorice, is the same. But they have added sorbitol, anise seed powder, and stearic acid to ""other ingredients."" It is sorbitol, a sugar alcohol, that adds the hypersweet taste. I'm looking for another brand and am returning this order."
1,No longer same product,DO NOT BUY THIS !!! - They changed the product. It is no longer licorice. It is only anise powder with an artificial sweetener now.
4,DGL,The taste was tolerable and after 3 weeks of using I noticed a difference. I went off of it for a couple of weeks just to be sure and I definitely noticed a difference. I would recommend this but keep an eye on your blood pressure throughout therapy.
3,"A quick read, but nothing too special...","Mari Sandoz is best known for her fictional biography of Lakota warrior Crazy Horse. This story is about a Cheyenne youth named Elk who would rather catch horses than go on the warpath, or even the hunt. The gist of the book is that Elk's problem is he is a pacifist in a warrior society. Sometimes, however, the story stretches credulity as Elk will eat buffalo... so long as someone else kills it. He will however kill an animal or human if his life is on the line. Maybe this is based on a true story that Ms. Sandoz heard from the Indians and she added her own details, mirroring her work on Crazy Horse. Also, the writing style is sometimes awkward. The intended audience is young adults. While I don't feel that my time was completely wasted reading the book, I didn't finish it with that feeling that I must read it again someday as I have with other novels of this genre."
2,"Horrible display, minimal contrast, large and clunky.","The display on this device is really hard to read, and the contrast is poor. The box is quite large compared to the display itself, it feels like technology from 1992. I can't recommend it. Hard to imagine the other products in this category are worse."
4,Great product - no yucky mess!!!,"I purchased this product after having tried Crest Whitestrips without much success. Needless to say, I was not expecting miracles! The product is SO EASY to apply. Just open and press onto your teeth. It has a cover on the outside to prevent you from having to taste any of the application. It actually stays in place and you can talk and go on about your day. They only have to stay on for 30 minutes - perfect for the commute to work! And these ACTUALLY WORK!!! Its not the same as a dentist professional whitening - but then again that costs $500! For around $25 I was thrilled and it only takes a week! I will definately purchase again in a few months!"
3,Teeth whitening,"Worked alright, a little waxy, but stayed on my teeth well while whitening, easy to use. It didn't whiten as much as I'd hoped, but then again I did notice a difference. My teeth were definitly whitened a few shades. I think you would need to use it more than once to keep it up and really see a difference. Did not make my teeth too sensative either."
3,Covers the basics of logo design,Covers the basic process of logo design. Good for designer beginning to design logos and as a reminder of process for more experienced logo designers.
3,OK,Book was okay but not exactly what I was looking for. I ended up getting a professional to do it and giving them my ideas. No problems with book just not what I needed.
3,Good but not breakthrough,I thinks it's a great book for designers starting in the field. But that's all. I'm 4 years designer wanting to improve myself and my design process ; I learnt close to nothing in this book.
3,Sparks creativity,"You will not become the logo master overnight. This book is a decent resource for developing your own thought process in logo creativity.The book is full of decent examples of ""how we got here from there.""It is good reading and very educational but not necessarily a revelation."
2,Amateur Video,"There is some useful information here, but this video makes most youtube videos look like cinematic masterpieces. I would recommend skipping this item."
3,A good summer read!,"This book was not as objective in its treatment of the subject as American Tragedy was, but I found it entertaining and interesting. Mr. Petrocelli does seem to become rather full of himself and the righteousness of his mission, and his point of view, though passionate, is a little more than slanted and a little less than believable. It is evident to me that lawyers seem to construct their own verdicts pre-trial then go about seeking every advantage to bring that verdict home. There's very little about a trial that involves getting to the truth of the matter."
5,OJ Speaks,I have read this before but I wanted to have the book for a paper I was writing. I love how Petrocelli traps OJ on the stand.
2,A 636 page ego trip!,"As both a trial attorney and ""court"" buff, I really enjoyed the factual basis of the book, and much of the accounts of the Simpson deposition and testimony were riviting, HOWEVER, when we hear about the genius, and yes heroic bravery of attorney Pettrocelli it goes so far off the deep end that it threatens to make the entire book perhaps best left on the shelf. The Best (worst) example of this was when he describes giving O.J. the chance to ""lay his hands"" on him while testifying. He goes to great lengths to to say that even though he is smaller then O.J. that he ""wasn't afraid"". As if O.J. was going to pull out a knife and kill him in a room full of lawyers! The value of this book lies not in the shameless self-promotion of the author but rather in explaining that both the criminal and civil juries in this case may well have come to the correct conclusion, and in explaining how the differences in the system can lead to this conclusion."
1,"Accept it world, OJ was innocent!","I followed this case very closely and I believe that the verdict was completely fair. No other verdict was possible. OJ was innocent! The notion that many people hold that public opinion polls ""proved"" he was guilty is ridiculous. He was either guilty or he wasn't. I have never had a conversation with anyone regarding this case - no matter how sure they were initially of OJ's guilt --who didn't come away with the opinion that there was a lot more to the case than they had previously thought and that perhaps OJ wasn't guilty after all. The fact that OJ is currently imprisoned in Nevada on ""kidnapping"" charges makes me lose a great deal of respect for our judicial system."
5,"Spellbound, Could not put this book down, until completed",Incredible inside story of a high profile murder case and an Attorney's belief that Justice would prevail. AND IT DID.
3,White Knight or Just A Very Good Lawyer?,"I agree that this book has a lot of what we want to read (or hear, since I've only listened to the audio version) about the OJ case: sex, violence, racism and how he was found liable. The main thing that bothered me about this book was Petrocelli's portrayal of himself as only doing this because it was The Right Thing To Do to get justice for OJ's victims: well, that, and it was the case of his career. If he'd just acknowledged that -- most lawyers take cases for mixed motives (see A CIVIL ACTION) -- I would have given him more credibility. But perhaps I'm too cynical."
2,Boring and incompetent writing,"Petrocelli (and/or his ghost writer) have put together a book that is replete with incorrect use of the language in terms of tenses and punctuation marks, and the writing style is without any real sense of flow. I found this effort tedious and poorly organized, certainly not worthy of an attorney of his stature -- unless it was written soley for the money that nearly any book about O.J. Simpson can produce."
2,A disappointing hodgepodge,"This book struck me as hastily thought out and written, with no love or energy expended on it.The grand concept is not particularly interesting, and the bits and pieces stuck together to flesh out the concept are hackneyed.I found it slow going and confusing, and not at all worth the time or effort.Not recommended."
4,Genesis: Our Future?,"Poul Anderson creates a very interesting and thought provoking future. The story spans forever and makes you wonder about consciousness, God, where the human race is heading, etc. Our main characters get uploaded into super computers. One goes space exploring and one helps to manage the Earth. Unfortunately, we don't follow these characters as much as I would like. The story rambles a bit, but definitely worth reading for those interested in the big issues."
1,A Disgrace,"Poul Anderson ought to be ashamed of himself. He took the worked-to-death theme of sentient machines, presented the same dead-tired ideas in a grandious backdrop - I suppose that was an attempt to make his readers think he said something new - integarated them loosely with some old short stories of his and called it a ""new"" book. What little story the book has lurches along until Anderson apparently got tired of writing and quit. It certainly had no ending in the normal sense of a novel. At times, Anderson's prose is almost poetry. It flows beautifully. Unfortunately, when examined for meaning, it's often complete nonsense. Add the fact that the only two characcters in the book are two dimensional strawmen that Anderson made no effort whatsoever to flesh out and what you get is a real stinker. The only interesting aspect is whether Anderson is a cynical old man trading on his reputation to grub some easy money or whether he's really that far over the hill."
4,"An enigma, poetry, and the odyssey rolled into one.","I've been wanting to read this novel since I read a short story by Ehrenreich in McSweeneys about an odd couple meeting in an aquarium in post-apocalyptic Los Angeles. Although it's far from my idea of the perfect novel and I can see how it might be construed as pretentious, I think Ehrenreich has a very unique, and poetic voice. I love the way this book and the short story I read seem to teeter somewhere between a surreal nightmare, a daydream, and everyday reality. It's not for everyone, but if you are looking for something different and you appreciate the craft of writing, it might be just right for you!"
2,COULDN'T GET INTO THIS,This book was allright in the beginning but some parts were boring. It was okay but it was worth 2.5 stars. The story was sad but moving but it fell apart later.
4,Exegetical Dictionary a Great Tool,This book is a classic reference work and a very useful tool for the Bible student. I would recommend it to all clergy and teachers of religion.
1,Disappointed,"The book had only one baby design that I liked, the rest were pillows, very basic accessories and boring designs for older kids, not even toddlers the same pictures of the same projects repeated thoughout the book. Colorful and well phographed, but no very inspiring."
2,Okay...,"This was an okay book. While I did believe that the book had great potential, Rob Roy fell short of my expectations."
2,Boring and confusing,"I have derived many hours of pleasure from this author. My favorite is Ivanhoe. I wouldn't recommend this one, though. It is boring and confusing."
4,Long awaited new CD was worth the wait.,"India Arie delivers more upbeat, positive and spiritually uplifting beats in her own unique sounds. She's not afraid to be herself and be different from the top tunes of today."
4,Powerful messages,Ms. Arie is mellow and filled with messages for her listeners. She's another favorite of mine to listen to while relaxing.
5,awesome,I love this CD.I can't stop playing it.It's one of the best cd's I have purchased in a long time.I live in Savannah ga she said in one of her bio's that she attended a college here for a while. I can't believe that I was so near her and never heard of her until recently.I am taking acoustic guitar lessons thanks to her.I'm anxious to hear her next CD. INDIA YOU GO GIRL!!...
1,Don't get it!!!!,"It's nothing to do with her I just found this album MAJORLY BORING!!! I am very angry that I spent the last bit of my bday money on it. All the songs are really slow with this annoying drum in the background bum, bum, bum, bum. Then she comes wailing in with her terrible voice. The only thing I liked about it was the song ""Video"" and the guitar which is excellent, but sadly hidden under her wailing vocals. It literally put me to sleep the first time I popped it in. I was HIGHLY dissapointed."
2,ONLY LISTENED 2 VIDEO,"yep, its official I LOVE video. only gd song on da album. i mean, she has gd voice but alicia keys & lauryn hill r WAY betta than her. glad she missed out on the 7 grammies she was up 4 in 2002"
1,I hate india. arie,"i hate this cd. her voice sounds like stinking bees! thru the whole thing she's all: um aa ummm, it makes me want to puke. i don't see why everyone likes her so much. she is very strange. i'm not trying to be mean, i'm trying to save you from buying this trash. india, do you think i am a fool? well i hope not. anyway, this cd is bad."
5,SHE IS THE BEST EVER !!!!,"IT HAS BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE I'VE HEARD A CD OF THIS QUALITY. EVERY SONG ON THIS CD IS WONDERFUL, A TRUE TALENT, VERY SOULFUL.WELL WORTH THE MONEY, YOU OWE IT TO YOURSELF TO HAVE IN YOUR COLLECTION...MICHELE MINARD"
4,Soul music...,"""Brown Skin"" is the jam, a refreshing tribute to those of us blessed with ""dark"" skintones. A fresh musical cousin of Badu, Scott, Maxwell, but all in all Arie creates her own unique sound.""Video"" is another song, describing her individuality and not all of womenfolk are blessed to look like those half-naked rump-shaking hoochies we see gyrating around in most videos. All hail the Queen! Some new music for a change. India Arie has arrived!!"
5,"simple, so simple...what more can i say","i first heard india arie when she came out on the bamboozled soundtrack with 'in my head' and 'can i walk with you,' and from those first listens i knew she had talent. she's since gone on to blow up with 'video,' and from listening to the rest of this album, it looks like miss india arie has staying power. she has a gorgeous...soulful sound mixed with funk and smooth r&b;, holding her own against neo-soul artists such as amel larrieux, angie stone, macy gray, erykah badu, and the superb jill scott. her positive messages of identity, strength, spirituality, & faith make her a definite treasure in today's radio hip-hop/r&b; market of 'money, cash...dubs, sippin' crystal,' etc. some highlights include:'simple' - simply sublime & my favorite track on the album. exquisite lyricism layered over an edgy beat.'video' - just about everyone's heard this already. positivity at its best.'butterfly' - sultry & funky. the epitome of neo-soul."
5,Soul Power,"It's very hard to raise a child now a days. At six, despite all of my good intentions, my daughter still thinks that she should look and be something she isn't. Imagine my delight when I first heard Video. This song tells people to accept and embrace who they are, love themselves!In an era where every other song speaks of fake this and plastic that it is refreshing to hear a song that tells you to love yourself.Then I heard Brown Skin, and I was hooked. This song is an expression of love for brown skin brothers. It also reminded me of the times I used to chase my husband down the street when he would leave to go home, wanting just a few more minutes to gaze at him.India.Arie has an awesome album that should be included in every music lover's collection."
3,Not bad but light as a feather,"Even though India claims repeatedly throughout her debut album to be following in the tradition of Donny Hathaway, Sam Cooke and others, she really delivers more pop than soul or R&B. As a pop album, it's solid, but it's not soul or R&B. She relies heavily on hooks and repeats the chorus over and over and over again. Plus, to me, her messages sound trite. Black is beautiful. Women shouldn't be judged solely on their appearance. I know, and I don't know anyone who doesn't know. Granted, I'm older. Maybe this is an important message for school-age kids, but that only adds to the bubblegum feel of the album.The editorial review has it right. If you like Tracy Chapman and Me'Shell Ndegeocello, then you will probably enjoy this album too. But if you're looking for soul music, you're better off pulling out your old Donny Hathaway and Sam Cooke albums.Peace,Oaklander."
3,really just average,"I was expecting something soulful and creative. This cd is feather-light. The lryics are slightly cliche and the chords get redundant after awhile. It was hyped up way too much. There is very little about it that is ground breaking. It's a great CD for younger people though. Positive and down to earth, it encourages an optimistic attitude."
2,Disappointing debut from this neo-soultress,"While India.Arie does deliver ""acoustic soul"" as the title of the album promises, this cd falls short of delivering the complex and unique sounds of other ""neo-soul"" artists such as Jill Scott or Erykah Badu. India.Arie has a sultry and beautiful voice, and it is apparent that she is a strong black woman deeply proud of her spiritual and ancestral roots. However, sometimes her lyrics come across as more preachy than proud. I also thought that her lyrics were trite and over simplified. There is more to songwriting than making sure the words rhyme. The first three tracks after the Intro, ""Video"", ""Promises"", and ""Brown Skin"" are the strongest tracks on the cd. But as I continued to listen, my excitement dwindled. Ms. Arie is a talented young woman, but she needs to work on her songwritting skills, and perhaps find stronger production. I believe her sophomore effort will be better."
3,Video is the only REALLY good song,"Video is the onyl good song on this album,and then it all goes downhill from there,which is not too good since Video is song #2. Not very catchy melodies,not too good lyrics,overall good effort but still. Out of 15 songs,only one was ""repeatable"" and that was ""Video"". All the other ones were of the same subject matter and got a little boring after a while. So get this if you want,i guess, but if you have a choice between this and another cd,get the other one. I can almost assure you itll be better."
4,Another word from Blighty - If you like Jill Scott....,"Judging by the Album cover I thought it was going to be along the lines or Ladysmith Black Mam... whoever! I was watching MTV and saw ""Video"", totally swayed me, this album is a must, very similar to Jill Scott in terms of, put it on, sit back and enjoy the ease of listening... very calming & soothing music."
4,A great 1st album for a great singer,"I saw this young lady perform on the Rosie O'Donnell show a few months ago and bought it off of a wimb without ""researching"" it very much and I'm very glad I followed my gut instinct. India Arie has a beautiful voice, and knows how to use it soulfully in her new CD. The lyrics are also very...inspiring. She knows who she is and doesn't let the pressures of society sway her from what she knows is right. We need more role models like her."
4,India.Arie is true Acoustic Soul,"If you like the sounds of Me'Shell Ndegeocello, Tracy Chapman, and Dionne Farris, this is the one for you. I immediately noticed the clean sounds of conventional instruments smoothed over with a voice that reminds me of a ride through the the suburb on a sunny day with the sunroof open. As I have refered to other artist that compare to her, she too will be one that many will want to be compared to in the future. Don't hesitate, pick this one up."
5,I can't stop listening to this CD,"This CD just makes me feel good all over --- great tunes, great voice, great lyrics --- all making me feel GREAT! I look forward to her next CD already (hint, hint :-)"
4,This is a tremendous step for music,"Her music is unique, mellow and smooth. Her songs sound like something heard in upscale coffeehouses catering to educated business folk. Her first single, the highly acclaimed ""Video,"" is the epitome of radio candy without being the fluff that happened to be popular in early 2001 when it was released (Britney Spears and the boy bands instantly may come to mind). India Arie is her name and she's about as soulful and introspective as anyone can be. Her music reflects everyday situations and real life. Sure, not all of this CD soars as much as the aforementioned ""Video,"" ""Brown Skin"" and ""Promises"" do, and that's sad because it's doubtful anything else other than that instant first single received airplay; but this talented singer-songwriter's debut Acoustic Soul is still brilliant, soothing as a first sip of coffee and as delightful as taking that first swallow and feeling the warmth down your esophagus."
4,I can feel you India,"Ok. I gave this cd 4 stars instead of 5 just because I'm not a liberal when it comes to giving out the twinkles. But I must say that this is a pretty good album. India is more than a singer she's also an artist. Unlike many of albums I was able to listen to this album in it's entirety. My favorite songs on this album are Video, Back to the middle, and Nature. I like Video because she seems to be a girl after my own heart. I like Come back to the middle because it focuses on balance (It's as important to have a balanced mind as it is a balanced meal). And last but not least I love Nature because it's great advice for those entering into relationships."
4,Love it,"I think that India is REAL. Like she says in her song, she doesn't need makeup, gucci, etc. This is a good album. I like it a lot"
3,Lyrically Satisfying/Hippie Chick Vibe,"The artist has a beautiful voice and the CD is a good listen. Lyrically it is above-average but I found the tribute to all artists that came before her wedged in between the tracks distracting...especially if you shuffle/mix your CD in a multi-disk player. Overall, a solid debut."
2,"Good Music, So So album","India's intentions are appreciated but I think that she misses the mark. The music is very good but the lyrics are a little too simple to be profound. A good departure from the current state of R&B which lacks substance and creativity, but not enough to make me play over and over like ""Mama's Gun"". All the songs are anti-climactic, and no one stands out above the rest, but India's calming voice makes you listen 'til the end. Sophmore effort will probably be better."
2,India Arie,"I saw her perform on a morning show, Regis, I believe, and she was great! She did her signature song, India Arie. Unfortunately, for the CD, this was the best song. I guess I thought from seeing her live that she was in a more ""universal"" mode - meaning, strength in herself, being herself (built from heritage, but transpiring it). From one poet to another, I was really excited that she wrote her own songs. That counts for a lot! However, my excitement was followed by big disappointment in that there were no printed words. What's up with sharing?"
4,I was floored when I heard this CD!,"I'm glad that there's something positive, truthful, fresh, and sexy that I can listen too. Erykah's hypnotic anguish has to take a back seat to India's soulfully honest renditions of life and love (of self). The beats are lush and flavorful and the lyrics are right on. If you don't have it then go get it. If you have it then buy one for a friend. We need to promote the positive and refute the negative. I pray that India (and the like) stay around for a while."
4,Great Break from the rest,"India is giving us something we can feel. The hit single ""Video"" was not really representative for the versatile style this album has to offer. India.Arie is right inline with NeoSoul artists like D'Angelo, Jill Scott, or Erykah Badu. Definitely a fresh breeze in the jungle of hear-it-once-and-forget-it RnB."
5,Soulful and moving,"The lyrics of ""Video"" is a preview of the ""Acoustic Soul"". She shares that her entertainment is only about the music rather than the image. Her songwriting and soulful singing prove her sincerity. She has mastered the soulful guitar sound that few others have. ""Brown Skin"" showcases this at the highest. If you listen to this CD, I will guarantee that you will feel beautiful inside and out."
5,Fresh,"Fresh....says it all! I absolutely love this CD. Each song is so unique and such a joy to listen to....just kick back, relax and let India Arie do the rest. I have to say this was one of the BEST CDs of 2001. A must have....you won't regret it!"
3,Very Underrated,"The only mistake India made was coming out around the same time as Alicia Keys. That's the only reason why she didn't win a grammy for this album and still remains underrated as far as neo soul goes.I brought this album when it first came out and I'm happy I did. All of the songs have a positive feel to them. No cussing and real lyrics that make sense. Some songs are about self love (Video, Strength, Courage, and Wisdom) and some are about new love (Ready For Love, Always In My Head). My favorites are Beautiful, Nature and Wonderful. India's voice sounds good over the soft beats.Overall this is India's best work to date"
3,listen before you buy,"This album isn't really as great as they say it is. Believe it or not. It's filled with bunch of slow songs. It's ok I guess. But I wouldn't give it a five. It's in the middle, 3. It's a relaxing type of music. If you like that then I guess it's for you. I only like the instruments and slow smooth sounds. Though it may make some of you fall asleep like some of you have mentioned earlier. I do recommend it to others however, as it is good. People have different tastes. I suggest you listen to it before you decide to buy it. If you don't like it atleast you won't complain on having wasted your money since you won't, but if you do like it then I'm sure you know what to do. I don't love it but I like it. That's all I can say. Your choice."
2,GOT TRICK INTO THE VIDEO SONG,"""Video"" highlighted my expectations to this album, Video it's such a great song, great message, and makes you remember of the good music that was use to be made, but it's a fact that most of the rest of the album is pretty boring and forgettable. The worth tracks here are the leading single ""Video"" and ""Streght, Courage and Wisdom"". Sadly I have to say that the cover of the album stands out, but the music not."
2,Soul? Where?!,"I really looked forward to listening to ""Acoustic Soul."" India has a great voice, and I believe that with some assistance with lyrics, and a new producer, she can be a moderately successful entertainer. But this album was a letdown. I thought that maybe it would grow on me, but ""Strength, Courage and Wisdom,"" seemed strained and made me lose patience. ""Brown Skin"" is beautiful, and I hope the song gets play, its the one standout on this CD."
2,Huge Dissapointment,"I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this album...god after reading all the great reviews I wanted to LOVE it. ""Video"" is really, really good. ""Brown Skin"" is fairly adequate, and ""Ready for Love"" is pretty. But the rest of the songs really lack the catchy vibe, and upbeat tempo that I love. If you like slow songs, and guitar playing-which she is excellent at, than try this album, but if you love Lauryn Hill, stay away. The two can't even be compared. They are both so talented, but in totally different ways. ""The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill"" will forever be my favorite cd. India.Arie is incredibly talented, but it's just not my thing, and I totally wasn't feeling her."
2,Drop the Acoustic Guitar \ and learn to play the guitar,"There are a few songs I like, but seriously drop the tired ass riff playing guitar...get a better production, her lyrics are descent, a little too much preaching, but OK...I couldn't listen to the whole CD, sorry"
2,"Sorry, but...","Liked the song I heard on ""Oprah"" (Video), but just didn't hear what Stevie heard in the rest of it."
4,A Soulful Journey,"India.Arie's CD is one of my fave releases of 2001. The tracks are fresh, sexy, and soulful. Ms. Arie's lyrics are uplifting, sensual, and poetic. This is the kind of CD, you can play in front of your older family members, and not have to edit out the curses, and/or inappopriate sexual references.My favorite tracks are the popular ""Video"", which deals with issues of beauty, and not falling to society's standards on the topic. I also love ""Nature"". It is one of the best love songs to date, without the usual sappiness. Go pick up this CD! It's a true must have."
4,FEMALE STEVIE WONDER,THIS ALBUM WAS HOT. I CAN RELATE TO ALL OF HER SONGS AND I TRULY APPRECIATE THE VERSITALITY IN HER VOICE. IT'S HEAVY YET VERY ELOQUENT. KINDA LIKE DR. MYA ANGELO. IT'S HOT AND I REALLY LIKE THE WAY SHE GAVE A SPECIAL SHOUT OUT TO MR. WONDERFUL. IT'S PEACE.
5,The Revolution can be Redeemed through Artists like This,This album is AWESOME. Every track has lyrical and melodic gifts. Real Music exists and it's not always what you hear on the radio. She is a deep sista and gives you some things to marinate on. Listen to this with someone you love or someone you like who need to know that you see the God in them. My favorite tracks are READY TO LOVE and BEAUTIFUL. Both bring tears to your eyes if you let them.
5,Fresh Air,"This woman is soooo talented. It is like fresh air when a new face or faces come on the scene that aren't confined to a genre box. India Arie, Les Nubians, Lauryn Hill, Rachelle Ferrell, Eric Benet, Moby (yes Moby)etc.etc. keep busting out of the boxes and it will encourage others to do so."
3,A waste of money if you have the original,"""Acoustic Soul"" is a classic album by India.Arie but this ""Special Edition"" is a complete waste of money if you have the original. The extra disc just has bonus remixes from the Singles off the album and these remixes are usually found on the CD Maxi and Vinyl singles. The same thing was done with Warren G.'sRegulate...G Funk Era. And while the remixes aren't bad, they are not worth the re-purchase."
5,The Best R&B Album I've Heard In A Long Time,"This album is nothing short of smashing. India Arie has the true voice of a Queen and the soul of our ancestors. The entire album is filled with phenomenal lyrics, extraordinary music, and a superb, harmonious voice! I hope this album goes at least triple platinum! To all of you who are considering burning this CD...please do not! Purchase it for yourself so that we can support this sister! I hope to hear many more beautiful albums from this gorgeous Nubian Queen!One!"
5,I can't even find the words to express myself!,"I can't even find the words to express how I feel about this album, or this beautiful woman...All I can say if India is reading this...""Thank You, Thank You, Thank You, You have touched my Soul, I want YOU to know you are me hero!!!!"""
4,Check her out!,"It took me four music stores to find one that wasn't sold out of this CD. ""Brown skin"" is hot hot hot."
5,Amazing,"How does she get such compelling, unique, sophistocated rhythms and depth into her songs with such a light touch? She has a gorgeous voice, something like Randy Crawford plus Tracy Chapman. I love this CD. Lends itself equally well to romantic home music and extactic skate dancing. ""Ready for Love"" and ""Brown Skin"" are so beautiful you could weep. I'm looking down the barrel of 50- but my two young nieces also loved this."
3,"Not bad; a little naive, but potential for greatness...","The thing I love the most about India is the fact that she's trying to be herself and not getting caught up the image thing. However, musically speaking there are other black female artists who've trod the acousti-soul path India is taking, most notibly Joan Armatrading and Tracy Chapman (but Ms. India is funkier than either). All and all, this is an enjoyable disc; I look forward to hearing more music from her after she 'suffers' a little more."
5,########11111111,"Great CD India! The words to her songs are full of meaning and expression. She handcrafts every detail of feeling and creates a masterpiece. The best songs on the cd are: Video, Promises, Brown Skin, Simple, God in You, and Part of My Life. These are in no particular order. I just bought this cd 2 weeks ago on the internet along with the Alicia Keys cd I purchased. On a review for the AK cd, it said Acoustic Soul was also highly recommended. I bought the CD only knowing 1 song on it and I have to say that I'm quite pleased with it. THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR YOUR CD COLLECTION!"
5,SOUL CD,"THIS CD BY INDIA ARIE...ACOUSTIC SOUL, IS A GREAT CD TO OWN IN YOUR COLLECTION. IT WAS A PLEASURE TO SIT-BACK AND LISTEN TO HER SOUL-SOUNDS AND RELAX."
5,What a shame....,She was robbed....whoever made the decision to not give her one single accolade at the recent award show....is just STUPID.Her CD was very nice and deserved much more love than it received.....I'm just mad about it!!
5,Inida's got soul!,India Arie's CD is one of the most soulful and passionate albums I have heard in a long time. She is real when she sings and her voice is similar to no one else. India's album is a must buy because she really moves you with her amazing lyrics and sound. India ... you go girl keep doing your thing!
4,Magical,I'm not sure on what show my husband and I first heard/saw India Arie. What I do know is that we were in amazement and hooked instantly. Incredible voice. Incredible sound. She is truly magical.We now have this cd and we love it. India Arie is so smooth. What a pleasure it is to be carried away by her fresh soulful voice.India Arie - we look forward to your next album!

5,India.Arie-Acoustic Soul,"I bought this CD last summer after hearing India's first single ""Video"" on BET. I was not disappointed. At first listen I knew there was something very special about India.Arie. Whether it be her unique music, which is acoustic soul/R&B (go figure) or her profoundly deep, refreshing, and heartfelt lyrics, I was hooked. I believe India.Arie and her undescribably wonderful collection of songs on ""Acoustic Soul"" should have won her the Grammys that she was in fact nominated for. While I am also a fan of Alicia Keys, I must say that the music and lyrics on India's album is much more original and unique than that of Alicia's. I cannot recommend this to you enough. It is MORE than worth the money. You will not be disappointed."
4,Ready for Love,"Listening to this album first brought back memories of ""Black Diamond "" by Angie Stone. I loved that album and this one also now holds a place there too. Though not earth shattering, India's voice style and music cannot be denied or ignored. She has listened to all the great singers and she pays tribute to the master of them all, Stevie Wonder. For that alone she should get five stars. But some songs felt too familiar as if I had heard them already, so she gets a 4.Outstanding tracks include Video, Promises, Strength Courage and Wisdom, Ready for Love , Beautiful and her Dedication to Stevie.Great album. My Jill Scott CD actually got to rest for a few days."
4,smooth,"india arie enters the neo soul ring with her awesome debut ""acoustic soul"". she's not the next erykah and ""acoustic soul"" shows that. on almost every track she plays her acoustic guitar but the material is more smooth r&b than soul. there are real instruments present but there's also drum loops. india's voice sounds relaxed, confident and smooth on each track. a great cd to kick back and relax to. fave tracks: ""video"", ""promises"", ""brown skin"", ""nature"", ""always in my head"", ""i see god in you"", and ""simple""."
2,not that good looking watch,i bought this casio watch. it's a little bit pricey. the battery didn't last long. the watch looks old fashion. i would rather buy the kenneth cole than that watch
1,Not useful,You'd have to be a very accomplished 2D animator to make use of this book. The notion of doing everything in hand drawn 2D first is interesting but probably not an efficient detour for most people who are trying to become acquainted with 3D animation.
4,hot & spicy,"These are as spicy as the other bagged spicy peanuts and you get more ounces for the same price, so go for these. The sell by date though was the same date as the day I received them, so I hope they hold up well as I only eat about a bag week. The other brand similarly had a quick sell by date. But this is the best buy I've been able to find anywhere for spicy peanuts."
1,A untrue story!,This is a book by a Government agent. He claims to be a Sikh but research shows that he just has a Sikh name to cover up his caste which is considered a low caste in India. He is definitely not an authentic Sikh .The book only portrays a Government view and is a biased
4,Well written and a different perspective,"Being a Sikh myself, I purchased this book to get a different perspective on the Operation. I must say that it is well written but sometimes the author (who himself led the operation) makes superfluous claims about the circumstances existing at that time. I think the content could have been more and the author could have put some more mental imagery and thoughts into writing rather than only describing the sequence of events. Highlight was some of the pictures which are in the book and I had never seen before.Good read; Some rare unseen photographs; A different perspective."
4,Javier Solis fan,"The service is very good, the item if was not broken will be fantastic. I love old music, but this specific item, the case came broken and I can not listen to the 4 first songs, the rest is fantastic.I like the fact that you carrie old spanish music. Thanks and keep it up."
4,an intellectual diversion,"I will not dupe you into thinking that B.F. Skinner is a master novelist, and that is the only reason I docked B.F. one star. However there are so many interesting ideas in here that you really need to read it if you would like a book that is enjoyable, but also leaves you with something to think about for months after you've read it. Whether you agree or not, you should read it!"
3,Interesting but slow,The concept of the book is interesting but it is too slow. About half way through I lost interest.The transaction with the seller was fast and easy.
2,"Extremely challenging ideas, but no strong foundation","I read Walden Two as part of a class assignment, studying the effects of secular humanism and other worldviews on this world. The book itself is full of extremely challenging in its ideas. It raises many points that can have a person strong in their faith even take these ideas and ponder them. What if it really could work? Skinner does a good job presenting his ideas, but he has no basis or foundation for which to rest them on. The inconsistancies of his thoughts stand out more than the characters themselves. If Skinner is hailed as an exceptional psychologist, why then can ten high school juniors take every one of his ideas and prove why they can't work? Also, these juniors can take his ideas, match them up with the worldview that applies (Naturalism), and predict where, why, and how his plans will fail."
3,weird...,"This book was assigned for my intro psych class. Well written, but it definitely turned me away from the idea of a utopian community."
3,Picture gives misconception,"The product was not what I expected, the cover wasn't even the cover that was shown in the picture. The book is in perfect condition but it wasn't the cover that I wanted."
5,El rey del bolero ranchero,Indudablemente este CD contiene excelentes temas de dos grandes compositores en la voz del inolvidable artista Sonorense. Cabe destacar la particular introducción en los temas Despedida y Lamento borincano.
5,Ginny is the best singer ever!,"I was a little hesitant to buy this cd since I never heard of any of Ginny's songs or her really but the reviews on this website made the cd look so promising. Her voice is beyong beautiful and kinda reminds me of Jewel......and Fiona Apple. I love the songs ""Without Condition"" & If you want me to. But all the songs on the cd because it's pleasant/relaxing music and it's about God. She is one talented woman.....with a promising career. :)Buy this cd for great tunes and it's all about our ""Great God""."
3,Cover was all cracked,"It was really old and the CD case was a mess. My mom is the Christian music lover in the family and she seemed thrilled with the songs, though, so that's what matters."
5,Incredible.,"I heard the song 'FREE' recently on a network television program and decided to check out the album. Ginny is exceptionaly talented. Her voice is sweet and mesmerizing, her lyrics inspiring, and the musical composition is outstanding. I'd recommend this artist to anyone who likes Sarah McLachlan, Sixpense & None the Richer, etc. Enjoy, I know you will."
5,Voice of an Angel,"I was blessed to hear Ginny Owens live this summer before I ever heard this CD. The CD is just fabulous...Ginny live is even better! She has the voice of an angel, her lyrics are insightful and the melodies are beautiful. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys well-performed and inspirational music."
5,The best new Christian artist since Amy Grant,"This album is truly amazing. My wife and I are 34 years old and we have had her album for about a month now. We really love every song on this album! They are like our children, we love them all equally, but sometimes you enjoy one more than another.""If You Want Me To""...is such a great inspiration for those lonely ""why me?"" times in my life.""I Want To Be Moved"" awakes my spirit.""Without Condition"" should set all those snobby Christians in the right place""Be Thou My Vision"" gives me chills with her beautiful voice, I only wish she would have done all the verses. It's a great start to the album and sets the tone.I could go on more but you get the idea...we are very impressed with this young lady."
5,I Love It!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This cd is excellent!!!!! I heard some of the track a week before it was released and every track they had played I liked. This cd is a little old school and a little new school but if you are a Carl Thomas fan you will like it. The first track ""Let's Talk About It"" reminds you of a Marvin Gaye sound,""She Is featuring LLCoolJ is more of a Stepper's song if you are from Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and the list goes on. The Baby Maker is Neo-Soul if you were raised in the 70's it on that style of music. This cd will never be as good as debut ""Emotional"" but it can be if you just give it a chance."
3,I'm Glad He's Back (3 1/2 stars),"Emotional was one of my favorite CDs...ever. So, of course it may have been expecting too much to think that this CD would be able to do what Emotional did for me. And it doesn't. Yes, it's a ""good"" CD. But nothing about it grabs me the way almost everything on Emotional did. But with music, especially R&B, in the state that it's in right now, this is certainly a welcome and needed addition to the music scene."
5,Carl Thomas,This new R&B artist to me; I found quite refreshing to my ear. Mr. Thomas ability to carry a tune and staying upbeat which; I enjoy listening too so much while trying to relax seem to fit my needs.
4,Carl Thomas keep's it coming with smooth vocals,"Man this album is a classic body of work it gives you slow cuts ,and upbeat songs Carl Thomas as been flying under the radar for awhile take a listen to this you will be happy you did and the new album is hot to there is life after Bad BOY LOL"
2,Let's not talk about it,"After Emotional where every single song was top shelf, he comes back with this? I think Carl is very suited for sultry love songs. Let's Talk About It did nothing for me. There were two songs on the CD that I actually liked, the rest were blah blah blah...Carl I love you so get back to the basics and produce another album with the quality and texture of EMOTIONAL."
5,The Review,"Carl Thomas is THE artist. His soulful sounds are loved by all ages. His new sophmore cd ""Let's Talk About It"" is the the new sound of 2004. This is a great cd go out and buy it."
4,what can i say?,"My boy c.t. did it again!!! I you don't like this album, maybe you don't have style about yourself. You have to have an ear for good music which is hard to find these days. Carl Thomas is ONLY for mature listeners."
5,Beautiful and classy,"Like Faith Evans, Carl Thomas is a rare breed...a classy R&B singer with a beautiful, understated voice. No Boyz II Men-style histrionics here, just clean, lovely singing. ""Rebound"" is an instant classic--and Carl's lyrics are lovely. A couple of duds, including that tepid LL Cool J duet, but the rest of the album is wonderful. There really isn't much music like Carl Thomas out there--it's either too hip hop, or trying too hard to be ""old school"" and/or ""neo soul."" This is what it is...beautiful, heartfelt contemporary R&B, with barely any cliches, and will sound just as good in 30 years. Way to go, Carl."
3,Much More Enjoyable Than The Last Album...,"To be honest my first Carl Thomas album, Emotional, collected major dust when I first got it and it still is. I thought it was too long and sappy (maybe it was just me!). So Carl Thomas slowly but surely slipped out of my mind and into oblivion. Although in between albums I had heard him on a couple hooks I didn't really anticipate his album. Then I heard the smooth 'She Is' and immediately purchased it. While the album is still a little on the soft 'sap' side, it's still good. The great songs include the aforementioned She Is, Anything, A Promise, Work It Out, BabyMaker, and Let Me Know. The rest of the songs are listenable but not memorable and the skits could've been left off. Everyone knows Carl Thomas can sing but he has yet to make a thoroughly great album. Hopefully the third time is the charm. 3 stars."
2,Does not deliver!,I am a fan of Carl Thomas and I think he is very talented but his sophmore album is no where near as good as the first one. There are two songs on the cd that I do like alot which is played on urban radio stations but the rest of the songs on the album needs more work (maybe a few remixes would spice it up a little).
1,Needs to try a new producer,"I looooooved Carl Thomas' first CD and could not wait for this one to drop! Major disappointment. He only had maybe 2 good song on the CD and the rest were garbage. Please try again Carl and do those lovely, soulful ballads that put you on the map in the first place."
2,NOT GOOD AT ALL,NOT MUCH TO SAY ABOUT THIS ALBUM AT ALLTHERE ARE ONLY TWO GOOD SONGS ON THIS ALBUMI LIKE CARL THOMAS FIRST ALBUM BUT THIS ONEHERE IS A NO NO I WOULD NOT BUT AT AFTER AGOOD PAL LET ME HERE IT
2,GUESS I'M MISSING IT!!!,"Just like the debut CD, ""Emotional"", this is almost as boring. Extremely bland music spells disaster for this project. ""I Wish"" is the only excellent composition on the previous CD, and nothing comes close to that on ""Let's Talk About It"". The first single, ""She Is"", a tired Surface sample that R.Kelly have already used on his ""R"" album, was a flop, and ""Make It Alright"" is struggling on the charts as well. Need I say more? Carl Thomas is in desperate need of good producers. Someone please call Jam & Lewis, Dre & Vidal, Joshua P. Thompson, Gerald Levert and Babyface, just to name a few."
4,Pretty Good CD,OMG I loved Carl Thomas' new CD. I cant say that I have a favorite song because i loved them all. He needs to keep doing his thing and not let anything stop him. If you havent picked up his CD then you need to go out and do that.
2,Should be: Snorkeling - How to buy and wear the equipment,"I wanted a book to teach me how to snorkel. This book teaches you how to evaluate and purchase the equipment to snorkel, and how to wear the equipment, but not how to USE the equipment!!! I see pictures of people diving underwater while wearing a snorkel - how do they do that without the snorkel filling up with water? Oh sure, I can figure out that if I lay on the water face down and have a snorkel in my mouth I can still breath, but I wanna know how to do more... This didn't even really touch on the basics...But in fairness - It is a very good guide on how to purchase, wear, and maintain your first set of snorkeling gear..."
1,You get what you pay for...,"I needed a car charger and was thrilled to find one for such a cheap price but of course, ""if it looks too good to be true, it probably is"" and in this case it unfortunately was. This charger feel apart in my hands LITERALLY the first time I connected it to my blackberry pearl. The piece that connects to the phone dissembled right away before I was ever able to use it. I definitely do not recommend this product."
1,Do NOT do business with Bargaincell!,"Bought a cell phone battery that, of course, died one week past their return/refund deadline. Refused to refund or replace even though the product is CLEARLY defective. This company is a ripoff and will never do business with them again. Consider yourself warned."
3,Car Charger,"I bought this for a blackberry that I had. Most of the time it charged it, but sometimes it didn't. I don't know if this was the phones fault or the charger's, but it did irk me. My brother has a phone compatinle with it and it worked when his phone was connected."
1,Too bad...,"It's too bad that people think of anyone that is not American as an animal that the world needs to be rid of. Perhaps there is something we are missing here, if we seek to understand other human beings even though we have different points of view it's possible that we can find some common ground and let each other be. If the U.S. had not so badly victimized these people, maybe they wouldn't hate us so much. Unfortunately this book does not illustrate any of that. It's a one way view, but I'm not surprised since the authors are regulars on Fox news!"
5,A MUST READ!!!,"Trust the negative reviews if you want; however, coming from a military member and someone who studies this stuff for a living, this is a must read if you want to understand what is REALLY going on in the Middle East. Get educated on what we need to understand, clearly, before we vote for a new President and State Reps. God bless.DZ"
3,Difficult to follow the theme through the book,These dual authors had a real story to tell but seemed to have some difficulty saying it clearly enough
5,Right on Target!!,"If you want to know what's going on in the Middle East, read this book. I'm only disappointed that it hasn't yet been released as a Podcast Audiobook. Definitely worth the price."
3,Good Book Bad PLug By Al Gore,"I wish Al had actually admired some scientists who inspired him to take a few chemistry, physicsa nd biology courses while he was at school. Al, you are apparently wrong on the impact of CO2 on global warming and the Nobel committee was premature to award you something that has not been proven. Now if you want to talk about the impact of CO2 on human health and animal health, that is an entirely different matter and I agree that pumping billions of pounds of it into our atmospheric mix is something we need to address. Unfortunately pushing a wrong headed theory which after 2 freezing winters and several cooler years will discount the effort to reduce air pollution and will diminish the ardor for nuclear, wind & solar power.Rachel Carson on the other hand wrote yet another fine book."
2,Interesting but meandering,"The subject of Ms. Thomas' book, her decades at the White House, assures that this book will be interesting. I was, however, disappointed at the lack of organization; the book reads like a conversation with a person who keeps remembering things to throw in and that can be inordinately distracting. There are also a number of factual errors in the book, which I would have thought a careful editor would have found and corrected. I have read a great many books written by reporters (Walter Cronkite, Dan Rather, David Brinkley, Lesley Stahl, Sam Donaldson, Charles Kuralt) and this was the only time I found myself distracted by the lack of organization of the writing. In the end, I found the book interesting, but not well-written."
4,Good Book,"What an interesting lady she is..I really enjoyed this book. I am Australian and I found her story fascinating.I can only imagine that for anyone in America, it would be even better. It is good in the sense of reading it and I kept thinking, you think you know someone and then there is a lovely surprise at the end.Boy, she has guts!!! good on her I say."
4,"""Mr. President?""","If you've ever wondered about the woman who for years asked the first question at presidential news conferences and also ended each one, then this memoir will be entertaining. Thomas had a long career and got to know every president since JFK pretty well, or so you'd think from this book which is chock full of interesting anecdotes and opinions. It is a bit repetitious and would have benefited mightily from tighter editing. One wonders if the publisher was a little too reverential to use the red pencil. Somewhere along the line, UPI, her employer, lost a lot of its power and impact, due to business turmoil. Still, Thomas soldiered on. She doesn't say much about UPI in the memoir, probably because she's still working, though for Hearst. If you follow the journalism biz, you'll want to read this one."
4,The news media demands accountability from an elected presid,"Reading Helen's book is like sitting across the table from her at dinner and having a long conversation. One can hear her speak each word. That conversational quality is most attractive and quickly draws any reader inside.What makes the most significant impact is Helen's passion for accountability from an elected president. She clearly speaks for a free press and champions an aggressive news media as defense against tyranny. We Americans need to be grateful for the shouts, the questions, and the persistence of the news media."
1,The front row at the White House has a price.,"I was disappointed that Helen Thomas managed to pen no less than 3 times in her book that former deputy White House counsel Vincent W. Foster had committed ""suicide."" Last October I had dinner with Helen Thomas at the National Press Club and handed her a copy of the addendum that was attached by the court to Ken Starr's report on Foster. The addendum was submitted by Patrick Knowlton the harassed and intimidated witness who is suing FBI agents and others for violating his civil rights. Helen Thomas remarked at the time, ""this should be reported to the public."" To this date not one member of the American press, including Helen Thomas has told the truth about the death of Vincent Foster and Patrick Knowlton's story is noticeably absent from her book.It would appear to sit in the front row at the White House as long as Helen Thomas you have to keep your mouth shut. This what we call award winning journalism? Her book was very disappointing to me."
2,Ms. Thomas confirms how the media is stuck on themselves.,"On page 139, Ms. Thomas chides former President Johnson for giving the Pop a ""twelve-inch bust of himself"" when the Pope gave Johnson ""a fourteenth-century painting."" I was looking for a fourteenth century painting in this book, but all I got was a twelve-inch bust of a self-absorbed (self-described) journalist. The Beltway has consumed another media-type. Save your money on this one."
2,Waste of a day,I never really enjoyed her work and this did nothing to change my opinion. Just another annoying liberal with a mediocre book.
1,Disappointing string of ancedotes without insights,"One would think that after having been a reporter for decades, Ms. Thomas would be able to write. One would be wrong. She apparently doesn't know what the word ""ironically"" means, nor the word ""quipped."" She repeats ancedotes several times, even ones that weren't that great to begin with. She quotes presidents and first ladies complaining about the press, without seeming to realize that their arguments are often much stronger than her lame ""freedom of the press"" argument. Does the public REALLY need to know about Caroline Kennedy''s dead hamster? Does it REALLY matter what reporter called in a story seconds earlier than a competitor? And do we REALLY need to know about every award she ever won, every compliment she was ever paid? This book might have been much better if Ms. Thomas had retired first, and thought about her life's work with some perspective."
1,Product didn't work!,"I purchased this product for my dad who has been diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa (RP). He has very limited vision but noticed that his night vision had gotten gradually worse so I did some research and came across this product. It seemed like a really good product that provided a natural alternative to offer some relief for my dad's failing eyesight. He took the recommended dosage daily for the last month and did not notice any improvement in his night vision. I'm not sure if his condition hampered the effectiveness of this product but for what it states, I have to rate it a failure."
4,Eyesight Rx,"Second best item before Andrew Lessman's ultimate eye support. Works Better than over the counter products.Confusion on direction; Internet says, quarter to third tablet. bottle says, 1 or 2 tablets.Tablets are so tiny, so I took 1 tablet every day."
2,bad taste,The pills taste very bad when crushed and I have not been able to find the contents of each supplement anywhre. I dont know how much of anything I am taking. Also the information on the bottle is microscopic and very very hard to read. Since it is still hard to read I am guessing the pills are not working.
4,This Kaepa Shoe Is Great,This shoe looks great and is very comfortable. I have bought myself a pair as well as a pair as a gift for my mother. We are both equally impressed.
3,Average,"I would agree, this edition is pretty lackluster. Not only that, the stories are inconsistent. Some are extremely well done, especially the better-known stories;and the writing is great, but the symbolic devices, such as paintings and mirrors, are way over-used.This lends a repetitiveness to most of the stories. The gloomy tone, revealing the hidden darkness of man, pervades throughout. For someone of his talent, Hawthorne repeats himself. I think his novels are far better than his short stories. I would recommend Scarlet Letter and House Of Seven Gables instead."
4,Smokefree,"Read this book slowly, because there aren't that many of it's type.Yes, the stories are uneven. The first two are so rocky that you'd perhaps think you've made a mistake--that these are the first inchoate rumblings of an unpolished master.But by the time you read story #3, Ministers Veil, you won't regret the wonderful prose, the delightful use of symbolism and allegory, the economy of construction-- in short, all that which puts Hawthorne on a very short list of American master writers.The only thing you might consider over buying this book, is one which includes ALL of Hawthorne's short stories. Young Goodman Brown for example, or Rapuccini's Daughter--maybe two of the greatest short stories in Western Literature, are not going to be found in this particular compendium of his early work."
2,This audiocassette is NOT an unabridged version,"On the Amazon page the Twice Told Tales audiocassette is called UNABRIDGED in capital letters (twice!), and the review states that Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales in book form contains 39 stories. Unfortunately, the Twice Told Tales audiocassette only includes ten stories on four cassettes. This is clearly NOT an unabridged recording of Hawthorne's Twice Told Tales."
1,A Sad Life,"Is the saddest person the one who gets his deepest desire and finds it to be empty? JD craved an audience, and in the end, it cost him two wives. This is a sad book about an empty man who tried to fill his emptiness with drugs, booze, other woman, and about every weird cult that has every come down the bend. His shallowness is surprising. How ironic that a man marketed as such an all American boy was anything but."
3,Ok not great,I liked John Denver's music better than his book. Still has some interesting parts and I did learn a few things about him. Worth the read if you are a fan.
3,It was alright,"I read the book and there was plenty information about his music, he did not go into his personal life much. As a young fan, I would like to have read a little bit more about his personality.The book is also hard to read, it jumps from place to place and does not stay on the subject. There are a lot of photos, so I enjoyed those. Overall, I think its a great book if you are an older fan, but again i would like to know more about the man himself.Anna J. Patterson"
