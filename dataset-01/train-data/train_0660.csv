1,Rip Off,This is nothing but a advertsiment for North American SkiTraining Center - sold as an instructional video. The actual information contained in the DVD is laughable - 5 minutes maybe. Unbelievable.
1,Zero stars,Please do not buy it.I never write reviews but feel the obligation to write one this time: it is a compilation of 1-2 minute tips and looks more like a commercial than anything else. All videos in this series fall into the same format
2,Do NOT BUY!!! Waste of money...,This should be a 1.99 download... do not waste your money here - the video sections are only about 60 seconds long (each) and there are only about 10-12 of them.. not in depth at all... just some guy who has to introduce himself every time... it's tedious..
1,awful!,"I bought this locally when I couldn't find Monin's syrup. I like Torani's caramel, chocolate, and nut flavored products in coffee. The pomegranate flavor, though, tastes like cough syrup but not as good. Monin's the one you want.Monin Pomegranate Syrup"
4,Challenges you to be a better parent and person!,"It is easy and sadly feels more natural for most of us to react to our children by yelling, telling, disciplining, shaming. Smart Love really instilled in me to be more conscious of my reactions and to take time outs (for myself!) and think about my daughters needs, wants, and normal actions for her age. Smart Love is all about empathy and understanding that little person you love so much. Bravo for Smart Love. Highly recommended."
5,A bible for all parents - the first truly helpful guide.,"Until now parents have been bombarded by conflicting advice. Smart love is the very first parenting book to give parents a way to avoid the shoals of harsh discpline and unacceptable permissivenss. All parents will find this an indispensable guide to understanding their child at every age and, most important, to translating that understanding into practical responses that will keep their children safe and healthy while making it possible for them to grow into happy, fulfilled citizens. If you care about raising children to take their place in a democratic society, this is the book for you."
2,Wordy and repetitive best describe this book,"I enjoy reading but found my mind wandering when reading through Smart Love. I think it's because the same sentences and phrases are repeated over and over and over again. I have only read the book through the chapter on one to three year olds (where I'm at in parenting) and have developed a strong adversion to the phrase ""inner happiness.""The ideas presented are interesting and helpful with my child, only the text itself is repetitive and draining on the attention span. For example, Chapter Three sounds like a reworked revision of Chapter One. How many chapters does it take to repeat an idea (even a good idea) over and over again?"
1,Beware if you are a working mom,"My daughter just entered the toddler years so discipline has become an issue for us. A friend who is an educator gave us this book as a baby present so I thought I would take a look. I was interested in their approach until I read their take on mom's return to work. Basically, they say that children ""thrive better"" if a parent is home with them until they are three years old. I found this broad generalization to be both offensive and unhelpful. These authors are so clearly biased in favor of stay at home moms, it undercuts everything else they have to say. Moreover, there is shockingly little evidence to back up their various claims. There are two pages of footnotes for the whole book. If they are going to throw around such concepts as inner unhappiness, the all-powerful self and the competent self and trash working parents this way, they should at least have some studies to back up their claims."
2,"Turtles tracks OK, but Grassroots tracks re-recordings!","'nuff said. Not a deception, exactly, as at least the original vocalist of the Grass Roots seems to be represented (although he can't quite hit the high notes), but it should certainly be advertised by visibly that the Grass Roots tracks aren't the originals."
2,You get what you pay for ... nice but virtually invisible pattern.,"This looks great in the picture, and it's a nice little ring ... but it will look like a nice little ring. The pattern is etched so low and thin only you can see it and only when you hold it close to your face ... and I have 20/15 vision. If you want to show support, this is, sadly, not going to do the trick. I gave them 2 stars only because the size was correct and the material seems to be good. If you insist on buying it ... tell everone what it is so they know."
3,K3 Ultra Slimp MP3,I have to say this has excellent sound....superb FM reception (actually better than the SanDisc that I traded this one in for)which I still miss....nice and slim....however I had to return two of these simply because I could NOT get more than 3 hours battery life out of it...and I listen to my MP3 while at work on a daily basis and would have to stop to re-charge it...and this often took way more time than I had anticipated....overall....I am happier with the Sandisc e160 (dell has an 9 mg for the price of 4 anywhere else) and although the FM reception is not as good as the K3.....I would not by the K3 unless I was only using it to walk and listen to music for short periods of time.
1,Get an ipod or a Zune.,I havent used this mp3 player in over a year. It wouldn't play and erased almost all of my songs I downloaded from Rhapsody saying that the songs were not licensed.I gave up trying to use this thing. I guess you get what you paid for. I guess its worth it to spend $200 to $300 on a mp3 player than $100.
1,Dissapointing product and customer service,"I bought this player for my 14 year-old daughter. It seemed to be an excellent option. The product is great looking, the sound is fine, etc. However, 4 months later the product simply ""blacked out"". It just did not turn on, so it became useless. When we called Samsung's service center, they asked for the serial number in order to repair it. Unfortunately the serial number was printed on a small paper label that was on the back of the player, and at some point in time it must have fallen off. Now the product will not be serviced by Samsung, and our money will go down the drain."
5,Better than IPOD!!!,"Sleek, light, beautiful design. Great software, very easy to upload music, sweet display, best mp3 player by far! great battery life, stores plenty of songs and i have ALOT! great sound quality...the list just goes on, i bought it the first day it came out, the wine red color one is the same thing but the color is just like the LG cherry chocolate cell phone from verizon (if anyone was wondering what it looked like). i like the black one more. i had a new ipod nano 2 gig and the samsung is just easier to use, looks better, and is something different."
4,Sweet mp3,"I sold my Ipod due to problematic Itunes problems & overpriced accessories and bought this. You get all the same features plus better sound quality, better display options and an FM radio. I didn't give it 5 stars because the radio reception is okay. And it's only FM radio, no AM for you sports fans."
3,Terrible distortion,"There is wonderfully great material within, especially if you are reluctant to have plunked down the seriously over-inflated import prices for A Sides and Besides, etc. ""Pictures of Bernadette, "" the song which led me to purchase this CD, is woefully over-recorded to a point of terrible distortion. I don't know if the individual CD I got is an anomaly, but I was far from pleased to have been burned so."
1,THIS CD IS A SHAME!!!,"Simple as this: the CD does NOT contain possibly the best song, ""Such a shame"". It is NOT worth the price..."
2,Checkit suite 7.0,"Don't buy it to use on Win XP. Versions less than 7.0 were wonderful on older Operating systems ie Win 95, 98 2000 and ME. Suite 7.0 is not user friendly. Look for a program elsewhere that has the same benefits."
3,"Interesting Premise, but Not Such a Good Book","The premise is fascinating, some of the events described are delicious, but all in all, it just doesn't have the zing I used to get from an Arthur C. Clarke novel. After awhile I found myself speeding through the pages just to get to the end. I don't think I'll read the other two books in the series."
2,Disappointing delivery of an imaginative premise.,"Great idea! But very empty. Imagine your accounting professor trying to bring life to characters and events. Poor character development. Missed opportunities to build suspense and use what's known about the tactics and strategies of two great conquerors. Instead of transporting you into an epic battle, it's like watching a chess game. Pass on this one if you value your time.For the best of Clarke and Baxter's collaborations, look to ""The Light of Other Days."" THAT is a great read."
2,Worth skimming to prepare for book two,"Like with many excellent series, book one of this one stinks as it lays the foundation for concepts the authors will explore later. The only reason I gave this book any stars is that I fault myself for expecting this to be a Sci-Fi book instead of being what it really is -- a historical ""what-if"" fiction fantasy. Book two is much better and I am very much looking forward to book three eventually."
2,Not a 2001 equivalent,"After hearing the reviews of Time's eye and Sunstrom on NPR I thoughy I would revisit the world of Clarke, whihc I had not done for several years. Suffice it to say that I found this first book to be tedious and not very interesting. The characters were rather simplistic and the story line did not make a lot of sense in terms of what the aliena';s hope dto accomplish. It makes even less sense with the second book, which has holes in logic that you could drive the planet Jupiter through. These were a very disappointing pair of books."
3,Good Beginning...,"Times Eye has some of the style of 2001, A Space Odyessy, but moves more slowly. It almost seems that these two great writers are having difficulty merging their styles.The book invites readers by seeming to offer a combination of Clarks Space Odyessy combined with Baxters Epic SciFi. It may turn out to be that when all the volumes have been written, but this first chapter is more alternate history than SciFi epic. I was definitely remined of Harry Turtledove when reading it. Now, I enjoy Turtledove's What If stories, so I enjoyed this book very much. I imagine a hard core SciFi fan might feel betrayed by the books sojourn into epic battles between Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great, both aided by technology from 2037!Whatever these literary giants have in store for us in future volumes, this book is Alternate History. If you like Turtledove, you'll like this book. If you have no interest in Alternate History, pass!"
2,It was ok,"I have long been a fan of Arthur C. Clarke and Stephen Baxter and expected good things from them as a team. I realise that the writing was probably done by Mr Baxter and that Mr Clarke might have taken a back seat, or it was written from notes. In any case, the writing style was clear and concise, but I feel the subject matter had been visited before. I'm sure I read something similar years ago. The characters were interesting, but never really gelled as I can't imagine the varied souls engaged in this book to have actually coexisted even in this state without massive disruption to each other. Humans, for all their cleverness, aren't smart enough to get along. In short, I liked the yarn, but you really had to suspend the disbelief. Book 2 is awful, but that's another review."
2,yawn,"They must seriously be running out of good ideas for sci-fi, because the premiss of this book just sounds HORRIBLE! However, because I am a big Clarke fan, I wanted to read this novel. It was a mistake. The idea of taking different people from different time periods and making them interact with one another is just ridiculous for ""hard"" sci-fi. It seems to belong more to the science-fantasy realm. There is little character developement, but the epic battle scene near the end is well written and just flat out cool. As silly as the premiss is, it is written as well as it could have possibly been done."
3,ideas are non-local,"blatant parallel rip-off storyline from Dan Simmons ""Ilium"" (which is a much better book)....blatant funtional rip-off storyline from his own 2001 series (micro-HAL smartphone..""am I going to dream..."")...shame on you Clarke.....anyway, had to read through it to the end as it's still entertaining, in parts."
2,Not up to Clarke standards,"I've been a huge Arthur C. Clarke fan for years, and also enjoy Stephen Baxter. However - this book begins as a thinly disguised attempt at promoting the author(s)' political views. I have a thick skin and normally don't pay attention to those things in the interest of the greater storyflow, but this is blatant and obvious in an ""in your face"" kind of way (for example, reference the character ""Sable"" who would in real life never have been allowed in NASA or even in space in the first place). The insults and propagandizing comprises a large part of the first quarter or so of the book. Then, with the anti-american sentiments mostly out of the way, the plot settles down a bit and starts to become interesting. By the last few chapters, it is actually reminiscient of the Clarke I know and love. Overall though, it is a disappointing book, and not worth digging through the garbage to get to the small amount of treasure."
3,"Great book, but Author died before finishing the series","I got all three books in this series after seeing some great reviews (Time's Eye, Sunstorm, Firstborn). I loved the story line. Each book leaves off with a cliff hanger that leads into the next book. The bad thing about that is the third book leaves off with a cliff hanger that is never resolved because the author (Arthur C. Clarke) died before writing it."
2,Derivative,"If one has missed Kipling--_Kim_, mainly--or Farmer's _Riverworld _ series entirely, this might just be bearable. As it is, it rehashes Farmer and utterly lacks the bite of Kipling. I was thoroughly disappointed and cannot make up my mind whether to give it to someone I don't like or simply discard it."
2,Scratches on Aluminum !Beware!,"This case did it's job at first, but then after a while the case started to create scratches on the side aluminum. This really diminishes the value in my mind."
5,outstanding!,"Excellent lyrics and music - songs with social insight into our culture and spirit. In every song there's a message about our society, about politics, about growing up in Puerto Rico... This music brings me many memories from the island I deeply adore. Not only are the lyrics inspiring but the music itself is also outstanding."
4,My home away from home!,"I love Fiel a la Vega! Their sound and lyrics make you feel at home even if your not there. I'm currently living here in the States and listening to Tres as well as the other three cds makes me feel right at home, I can even feel the warm summer breeze filled with the scent of the sea. They are a great group, their music calls to your senses, and this mix of rock and puertorrican music is fresh and exciting. I had the opportunity to see them live at El RUM during the Cinco Dias con Nuestra Tierra college festival of 1995. Since then they gained a fan. I'm eagerly waiting for their next album!"
2,Author Desperately ISO Editor,"Whether or not Phil Patton's latest is factually accurate or merely revisionist sensationalism, the first half of this overly long ""history"" of the VW Beetle makes for an entertaining enough read. But past World War Two and Hitler's interest in developing the ultimate people's car, the narrative loses focus and seems to lose its way amid references to Charles Manson, Mickey Mouse, Nike Town, and a host of other pop culture items. I almost got the feeling that the author wasn't quite sure which direction to take and that his editor was MIA. I found myself also losing focus the more I read and by the time the author discusses the Autostadt, I'd lost any semblance of interest. I'd have stopped reading, but I had less than twenty pages to go.My hat goes off to the dust jacket's designer. It's exceptionally eye-catching."
2,Very few illustrations,"It would seem logical that a book about the various mutations and variations of the VW Beetle would be full of illustrations - this book has very, very few. Not recommended.Instead, look for ""Volkswagens of the World"" - even though it covers much more than just Beetles, it has over 650 photos and is a much more enlightening book."
3,Hysterical classic of trash cinema......,"Take a hyper-masculine George Kennedy, add a flawlessly coiffed John Davidson, mix in a bit of pot-smoking Jimmie Walker, and finish off with a complete lack of drama or suspense and you have one of the finest guilty pleasures ever released. While the first two ""Airport"" films will always stand as the best, the final entry in the series manages enough unintentional laughs, groans, and awful attempts at special effects to keep fans satisfied."
3,The Concorde: Airport 79' Movie.,"After seeing my Favorite Airplane! movies it's kind of hard not to ruin the Airport series of movies, and while this movie has been often criticized I liked it, *Spoiler*The Villain Ironically was to become a villain in real life and some say get away with it. (Wagner along with Walken and Natalie Woods, Who Did it?) The effects look compared to now outdated but don't let take away from an otherwise serious and yet good movie."
1,They're sending the wrong movie!,"I ordered Concorde (1979) starring Alain Delon and Susan Blakely, the 4rth Airport movie, from this page, as advertised, but they sent a 2000 documentary called Concorde. I sent it back.UPDATE: Amazon.com has revised the product details to cover their mistake, and are giving me a refund."
1,The plane that carried the Pope and crashed outside Paris,"The ""white tail"" Concorde that was loaned to the film company for the making of this motion picture, was later used to ferry the Pope around on one of of his tours. Sadly, it was also the aircraft that crashed on take off from CDG in 2000 with a full passenger load of German holiday makers.The plane had been in storage for a number of years prior to 2000."
4,Excellent! One of the best films I've ever seen!,"Truly one of the best movies that I have ever seen! This Airport sequel has a mostly new cast, and takes place on a plane that I find amazing! I can't believe that this movie is not more popular than it was!"
1,"""LOVE BOAT SOON WILL BE MAKING ANOTHER RUN, THE LOVE BOAT PROMISES SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE!""","'Airport 79 Concord' is embarrassingly bad, even for this type of film. With ""JJ"" Jimmie Walker and Charo in the mix, it's hard not to think of this film as a predecessor to the 'Love Boat'!This installment takes forever to get started, meeting the cast and setting up the inevitable disaster that will unfold, but this time the action is almost non-existent! I won't even get into the credibility of this uninspired C R A P fest!....no wonder this was the last one! It's available on a box set with the other 3 Airport films at a bargain price so it your a fan of the series......."
2,Airport '79 or Airplane '79?,"Mach 2 barrel rolls? George Kennedy in a bedroom scene (barf)? And the most amazing is while under missle attack (!!!???) they never radioed what was happening! This film is just totally unbelievable. Don't waste your time. Oh, did I mention how is it that Joe Patroni went from airplane mechanic to Concorde pilot? I thought he was only licensed to taxi (Airport - 1970)."
3,The Concorde: Airport 79',"After seeing my Favorite Airplane! movies it's kind of hard not to ruin the Airport series of movies, and while this movie has been often criticized I liked it, *Spoiler*The Villain Ironically was to become a villain in real life and some say get away with it. (Wagner along with Walken and Natalie Woods, Who Did it?) The effects look compared to now outdated but don't let take away from an otherwise serious and yet good movie."
3,Its Okay,I would't want to be on a same place twice that does those many turns. But as I remembered when the concorde was alive it was fast.
1,everyone got it wrong... not the Airport series.,this show has nothing to do with the Airport series.everyone is wrong.this is just a 60 min. show about the first men to fly the Concorde.
2,Great Book No serial number for online part,"I bought this book from Amazon recently, they have been great about getting it resolved but from what we can tell after having replaced twice the serial number that they mention on the book is not included in any of the books Amazon has in stock."
4,A real good album,This may not be 1 of the CD's you pick to be stranded with on a desert island. But if you like 70's rock music you'll enjoy listening to this one. There are a couple of very good songs on here that are right up there with any classic 70's song.
3,Sail On Sail Away,"I really don't like mid-70's metal bands, but I heard Sail On Sail Away when a friend put a cassette together for me. I've seldom heard another rock song that stuck with me as long as this one. I bought this CD just for that song, since the cassette is long gone."
1,Very uninspired Album--very flat and hollow,"This is a typical heavy metal album of the seventies but the songs are not at all interesting and get very boring on second listen. The singer is fair but the guitar players play the same riffs over and over again. Very unoriginal and uninspiring. I was going to try out the other Moxy albums but upon listening to this, their very 1st album--I decided not even to try. Rock and Roll collectors avoid this album at all costs!!!!!!"
3,Useful information for those who know they need the info!,"Useful information for ADD folks and those who love them. The challenge, of course, is getting the ADD folks to focus on the timely info before they get involved with life: jobs, marriages, interpersonal relationships......Book is a good baseline from which the non-ADD person can coach loved ones."
4,"At last, a deeper look","The new Nosferatu Clanbook takes a new and novel approach by not presenting Nosferatu as being the be-all and end-all clan of Vampires. Taking a slightly more realistic look at the clan, it better illustrates their strengths and weaknesses then many of the books which have preceded it. While I personally find much of the charm in the book is to be found ""between the lines"", this may grate on some readers who would prefer outright statements of fact rather then having to deduce information by what is said and what is not. The information on Nosferatu living spaces (sewers throughout the ages) and social structure was much needed, though admittedly dry. On the whole, the clanbook is a valuable commodity to a storyteller or role-players, but is likely to be of little interest to those simply looking for new disciplines and methods to make yet another combat monster."
4,"A improvement, but not a classic.","It have MUCH more information than the first second edition clanbook, but it lacks the organic feel of the original. The new templates are great and the merit/flaws are really cool; however, some of the multiple perspective writing is a bit befuddling. All in all this is a good supplement for the white wolf line, but it's not perfect."
5,A Magical Experience,Brazilian greatest composer and brazilian greatest singer ever. That's just what you will hear in this CD. Maybe it will change your life or make you want to apreciate it more. That's what happened to me.
5,Definitive recording of Jobim's music,"For my money, this is the definitive recording of Antonio Carlos Jobim's music, set in his native tongue and featuring Elis Regina's breathtakingly beautiful singing. This album ( along with the album Frank Sinatra cut with Jobim in 1967 ) constitutes the high-water mark in recorded renditions of Jobim's music."
5,My FAVORITE CD,"I only wish there were more than 13 tracks on this CD.I end up setting my player to repeat, because I just cannot get enough.Of all the music I've ever owned, this is my favorite of all time."
5,Elis & Tom,This album is considered THE BEST album ever released in Brazil! The performance of Elis Regina and Antonio Carlos (Tom) Jobim in this album are absolutely impeccable!!!
5,"Please, buy it.",Aguas de Maro alone makes this CD unique (it must be one of the best duets I've ever heard). Elis Regina was one of Brazil's greatest singers. Her voice behaves as a carefully-tuned instrument. Get it. You won't regret it.
4,Furacao,"Elis, the little hurricane, had one of the most powerful singing voices--amazing range and acuity, and it's all on display on this record, because Jobim's compositions have an equally impressive range. Some of the arrangements are a little too ""poppy"" for my taste, but the electric organ works to great effect on a tune like ""So tinha de ser pra voce."" And everyone is familiar with the version of ""Aguas de Marco""--the very structure of the lyrics allows Elis and Tom's voices to engage in a sinuous cat-and-mouse game. By the end of the song, they are simply singing out disconnected syllables, both under the spell of the music. ""Triste"" is given a nice turn, though the guitar solo at the end doesn't quite fit. Elis lets it all go on one of Jobim's quintessential ballads, ""Retrato em Branco e Preto"", Tom very tasteful on the piano behind her. All in all, a little syrupy, yes, but it can be forgiven because it was the 70s, and syrup was everywhere."
5,Heavenly,"This is spiritual music that takes me to depths of love and peace that I long for every day. The piece ""Aguas de Marco"" puts a smile on my face every time I hear it. Thank you Elis and Tom!"
5,Masterpiece. One word to define 2 best Brazilian musicians,"Tom Jobim and Elis Regina. The best Brazil can offer in terms of music. She is probably the greatest singer we have ever had. Tom Jobim is already known by everyone who has interest in Jazz and obviously, Bossa Nova. This CD contains the best of Tom's in the most beautifull voice. I bought it 3 years ago and it still remains in the top of my personal ranking besides other Tom's titles."
2,not adult sizing,"wasnt very happy. I believe this is a misses size - not adult size. Ordered adult large and barely fit my 13 yr old. The ""adult large"" was written in marker on the plastic wrap - but did not say adult on tag. The shipping to return it was too much to be worthwhile and put a damper on a birthday gift for a friend - who has given it to her size 2 daughter to wear. It did however come in a timely fashion."
3,"Not bad, as Alias tie-ins go...","Sydney botches a mission and Weiss pays the price, becoming infected with a deadly bio-weapon. Can the team fine the vaccine before it's too late, or will Sydney's rivalry with her sister cost Weiss his life?There would have been a little more tension in this book if they hadn't infected a main character from the tv show. Also, a vaccine doesn't do much good after you're already infected, does it? Shouldn't they have been searching for an antidote or cure? Oh, well. Regardless, it was a fast-paced, exciting book that had some actual character development between the fights and spy stuff. Everyone was more-or-less in character. Replaced is certainly the best of the Alias tie-ins I've read thus far."
4,True to life and very authantic,"As a former FBI agent i enjoy reading authors perspectives on the FBI. Lindsay, also former FBI, spent alot of time developing characters and procedural drama. I found the book to be entertaining and very authantic, made me remember what it was like to work for the Bureua. Also entertaining was Lindsays' portrail of the relationship between agents and management was much like the bureacracy i worked under."
1,Did I Read the Same Book?,"Lindsay may have his FBI details right, but he's got a lot to learn about how real people talk and act. Hardened street criminals melt into submission with just a few well-considered tactics from the mighty Mike Devlin. Oh please. This is an ex-FBI agent's fantasy of being the renegade, establishment-bashing fed--earning the respect of the bad guys while at the same time taking arms against the stupidity of the Bureau bureaucracy. The whole effort strikes me as a children's-book version of a crime novel--no subtlety, no ambiguity, no reality."
2,maybe i missed something?,"but found book had a good premise, then went in too many separate directions . . . obviously, did not enjoy it as much as the others."
5,You know it's the truth,"Witness to the Truth, a glimpse of what the F.B.I. is really like,rings awfully true, especially to anyone with a smattering of understandingof our legal system's faults. Paul Lindsay has told a riveting story anddrawn clear and cool characters without succumbing to the temptation to gettoo much into their innermost feelings. You understand the people well enough --he doesn't have to tell you why they do what they do. There is no questionthat the F.B.I. is ""exposed"" here -- and you can see why this book, which shattersa lot of illusions -- could have cost Lindsay his job. It's aa great eye-opener and a great story."
1,Boring.,"I don't know why everyone fell in love with this one. Every piece of action, every plot move, and certainly every single thing protagonist Mike Devlin ever did, thought, or dreamed was completely predictable from start to finish. Instead of characters author Lindsay gives us stereotypes and quirks (the talkative Irish guy; the Jewish friend with bagels; the well-spoken black Viking partner who, yes, dies nobly like a good token should). The story is just a lot of macho fantasy with no life or conflict. And the crimes resolve themselves so neatly, so bloodlessly (with the exception of the above-mentioned token) that one wonders why these guys are so world-weary and bitter in the first place. For all Paul Lindsay's vaunted FBI experience, there's little in this book that rings true, or even interesting. It's a gripe-fest, and a tedious one at that."
1,"Poor quality, don't waste your money","If you're seriously looking for high quality CAD symbols, don't waste your money on this. I was very disappointed with the quality. Some of the ""Symbols"" consist of only two lines."
5,Profane Gal,"This is not a recent Gal Costa album. It was released in the 1980's, her first single ""Profana"" (written by Caetano Veloso) was censored by Brazilian authorities, it includes one of Gal's great renditions of Djavan's compositions, her version of Stevie Wonder's ""Lately"" and a second succesful single, a ""safer"" one, a medley of popular tunes. A very good album."
4,Informative material,"In a world where there is little educational material regarding hyperbaric nursing, this book does a very good job covering the essentials."
5,Breathtakingly beautiful but what happens next????,"This is the ninth in my favorite series of all time and space. Even if you think you are not interested in the adventures of a 17th century French woman, you will be after reading just one page of the first book. Though not a lot happens in this book, I loved it anyway - characters are developed and become real to us. These people just pop off the page and reading their conversations makes one feel like a participant! The most depressing thing is the end leaves one hanging! The author did write three more books in the series but alas, they have never been available in the USA. HELP!!! So many of us are dying to know what happened. This series transcends everything - it has the ability to bring diverse souls together no matter what age, sex, race or ethnicity! I don't know of much in the way of entertainment that does that. I can't recommend this series too highly - you will forget everything - and enter another world - as real as the one we live in!"
2,Hard to Believe,"I know that rape occurs all the time but it was hard to believe that a handsome, well rounded, smart, outgoing young man like this could rape the step sister he had played with for years. Yes, his Mother did desert him and virtually rejected him but I can't see the motive for the sister rape. I liked the hospital scenes. This was my 8th Thayer book and the least liked. I'll keep on though"
2,Slow but realistic,"I guess when things like this happen, this is probably a pretty close comparison as to how it is handled. The book was easy to read and the writing style was decent, maybe a bit juvenile. It is about a high school girl who suddenly tries to commit suicide and then claims the reason is because she was raped by her step brother. He denies any such thing. The book keeps you debating about who is telling the truth and who is lieing and how the parents handle the ordeal. It was a disappointment though here and there the author will throw in a little surprise. The parents were boring and somewhat lame at times, as is most of the book anyway. But I guess if you want a laid back, easy to read book, this is a good choice."
1,"Badly written, period!","I tried to like this book, after all, I devoted several hours of my life to it, but it is so badly written that I would prefer to give it no stars.The story could be interesting, but the writer made the bridging parts of the book so bloody boring. I cringed every time Linda went to Owen for *warmth*... or relished the *warmth* of a room... the character Linda is so unrealistic and annoying. There could have been chapters of Linda's seasonal disorder. The story would have been better told from Emily's perspective."
2,"didn't seem realistic, and drug on","A mother that seems to believe that counseling will fix a step family enough that she will be able to keep her daughter and her new 'step family' intact, is not a mother that you end up having much sympathy for. The basis for the plot is good, a step brother and step sister, the brother rapes the sister, and the story is to examine the relationships of all those involved. But there is too much extraneous tidbits that really do not have much to do with the rest of the plot. The neighbor who seems to have a crush on the father, the friend of the mother that admits she is pregnant.... there is no followup on why these characters are included in the book."
1,Broken,I was given a Conair heated lotion dispenser three years ago for Christmas. The pump broke after about a month of use. My brother got me this one for Christmas this year. He got one for his girlfriend as well. The pumping mechanism broke on each of them after a month. I will never buy another Conair product again. They produce garbage.
4,This is a great book for the avid goal setter!,This book is full of great ideas of things to do in any year! It covers all areas of peoples intrests and gave me ideas of things to look forward to. It is a very interesting read. Definatly worth the money spent. The book lost it's fifth star for it's slight (but forgivable) lack of thrill seeking suggestions.
1,Not as advertised.,"This was advertised as a color correct flash tube. IT WAS NOT! So, I paid for Shipping and Handling TWICE for something I could not use. So, I'm out roughly $20 for nothing."
3,not bad but badly needs cube's direction,after a few years after lench mob broke up after jd's incaerceration shorty wanna make a cd well it's cool the beatsd are alright but this is why lencvh mob was all about jd and cube anyway truth be told shorty can't hold his own he wanna diss cube and still cube has evolved further in movies and music while jd's still locked up abnd shorty and t bone are memories.
4,DA LENCH MOB STILL ROCKS...,"Purchased this cd a few years ago and I was very pleased with it.Production is tight and beats are hot.Still hoping the reunion for the ""Mob"" will happen...WEST COAST and all hip-hop sure could use a boost of consciousness at this point.DA LENCHMOB's 1st cd still rocks and this is one is from one of it's original members."

2,Generic at best,"I love Mark Kendall from Great White. Mark really just needs to focus on Great White. This is just bland blues based rock, and really doesn't hold a candle up against even the worst of Great White's records. If you are still curious don't pay more than $5.00. Seriously."
4,bought for fertility,"I bought this to help regulate my cycle. It has a pleasant taste, so it makes my water taste very yummy. I also add it to my moon time teas (hibiscus, motherwort, nettle, raspberry leaf, red clover and oatstraw). I can't say it has increased my fertility, but I do think that with a combo of other herbs this would work."
2,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE,"The wig seemed to be really hard, and the dress just wasn't as cute in person."
4,Matrix,"My rating based on the fact that I've been using the product for some time and cannot honestly say it works. My nails are not getting any worse, so it probably is helping. I'll keep using it for the next few months and hope I can say it really works. As for the packing and the delivery time. I'm more than satisfied."
3,Hell on Earth Part I,"I have been very excited when I opened my postbox and the DVD was inside, but I was shocked when I heard the first time the DD 5.1 Track. There is only a very thin stream sounding like DD 1.0 or less. Only during some seconds while the captures change full sound is available after that it sounds like if someone turns off the loudness. Poor Manowar...first they have had trouble with the video-sound now the DVD is released with a very bad DD 5.1 stream. If you change over to DD 2.0 full sound is guaranteed. The DVD is worth to be seen, there is really all included...but sometimes the posses of Joey DeMaio are too much.And now quick add to cart this item...turn up your home cinema system and enjoy the show..."
2,"Unless you are a diehard Manowar fan, skip this and buy 2&3","This was the best we could get for a casual fan of the band at the time. Seeing Parts 2 & 3 later really make this unnecessary. If you haven't bought this yet, don't! Buy Part 2 followed by Part 3. That will give you these guys live. Beware, they do take themselves WAY too seriously!"
4,Family Pleaser,"This movie was ""adorable"". After seeing this movie and loving it, I had to take it to the rest of my family and watch thier reactions. It's a keeper. The plot is yes, a little corny and yes, a little silly. But, the cast was well positioned in thier characters. The thing that most amazed me was how sweet the artist character in this film was. Previous to my awareness of Brad Pitt, I thought he was wonderful. And after I realized it was him I had seen in this movie...I had to see it again and yes....again."
3,A cutesy fun movie,"I found The Favor to be a cutesy fun movie. It wasn't a movie where you had to do any thinking but could just sit back and enjoy the laughs. For what it may have lacked by today's movie standards, it made up for in being good clean fun where nobody has to close their eyes or cover their ears."
3,Could be a little bigger,"It's really snug and sometimes hard to slip on. And some of the stitching came loose already because of said fact. Other than that, it is great."
1,Doesn't work,"Tried it on several types of jewelry with the recommended cleaning solution. It doesn't have any noticeable cleaning capability, and will be going back to Macy's."
1,Very Disappointed,"I was very disappointed with this book. Its cover gives the impression, with bullets, that you will be able to learn several things from the author. For example 1) Using an S Corp for a personal tax shelter. 2) Completely avoid paying any income tax. I bought this book thinking that I would be taken through a step by step process on how to accomplish at least those items highlighted on the books cover. But instead, I was taken through a lot of general information without really being tought how to ""do"" anything. I believe that the author is knowledgeable, however this book was sold as a ""how to"" book. It feel way short of that mark."
3,Gary - Coast Cutlery CUS100,"The advertised CUS100 by Coast Cutlery does not exist!! When I did not receive my order it took 8 email attempts and 5 phone calls with the Amazon vendor plus 2 emails with Coast Cutlery to ultimately receive the substitute Coast Cutlery CUS100cp, which is very similar but with a black coated blade. I like the look of the knife I received; it has the features I want. But, I have not yet put it to a field test to give it high recommendation. I might recommend the product, but not the selling vendor."
4,Great Tent,I have taken this tent on 5 camping trips. Very easy to set up. Lots of room. Great for tall people like me as I can stand inside and walk around it. All four walls and the ceiling are well ventilated. The rain canopy is very easy to put on after the tent is already set up. It is so big and roomy inside that my friends call it the 'Taj' and the 'party tent'. I would have given this 5 stars except that the spring guy wires in the poles no longer work in 3 of the poles and one of the nylon peg loops have already come off. THe poles still work without the springs but you have to make sure that the sections don't come apart as you are setting up the tent.
2,Collapsed in Hailstorm,"This tent lasted me less than 24 hours. It's nice for fair-weather, but that's what I was expecting based on the weather reports. A hail storm came, and the hail collected on top of the canopy. Because it made the top sag, water was able to collect as well. I had left the campsite and went into town because the storm was getting bad, and when I returned after it cleared up... I discovered that the tent had collapsed. The metal tubing had buckled (at the joints) under the weight of the water/hail.I still like the tent a lot, how it assembles and such... it's just not hail storm proof..."
4,Christmas tree bows,"I've tried several different gadgets for making freestyle Christmas tree bows, but found this one to be the most accurate and consistent for size of finished product. Finding the replacement ties a little tricky, since the item was not at the local Michael's or other craft stores. I found them at [...] special order. The overall product design is good, but should have been made a bit sturdier. Looks like it is a bit delicate."
2,Cancelled because not delivered in time.,"I ordered this set of Pimsleur language tapes hoping to get them in time to practice the language before travelling. Unfortunately the used book dealer delivered the wrong item to my house. After waiting for a reply to my inquiry for several days, I decided to cancel the order as it would take too long for the company to retrieve the tapes I had purchased and then mail them to me. So I sent an email cancelling the order. I received an email back expressing regret at the wrong delivery and agreeing to a full refund."
2,Cheap Cheap Cheap,"If your looking for a little bit of Bass in your whip, then buy this system. I owned a system very similar to this, and i enjoyed, that is until i stepped up to real a real system, JL AUDIO! Its much more expensive, but worth it. But, if your you want bass on a budget, these are your subs/amp!"
5,Delightful to the ears,"Smooth, funky, groovy type of music that you can chill out. This is the type of music you hear in a hip little bar where everyone i out for a good time and to ease the days stress.Of course you can creat that atmosphere at home. I like all the songs on this album, it mellows me out."
4,Crossing the Liquid Mirror,"My main wish is that I had some more imagination, so that I could build in my mind better scenarios and landscapes, which is somethnig you litterally feel obliged, forced to do while the tracks in this CD basically take you to a different world, to an unexplored spiritual dimension. Very, very smooth, tasty, elegant. My other wish is that there only were some less digitally sampled instruments playing.. Dear Mike Francis, you did another great job!"
5,GREAT DEAL,I KNOW WHEN I NEED TO FIND SOMETHING JUST GO TO AMAZON THIS IS A GREAT DEAL FOR THE PRICE AND I CANT FIND IT ANYWHERE ELSE
1,Unexpected Disappointment,"I have always liked wearing a musk scent. I purchased this product expecting it to be good to very good. Unfortunately, it was not as expected. I gave it several trys: after a shower, in the morning, in the evening, etc. In addition to stinging my skin, that musk scent never came through. I should have returned the product, but instead I just threw it away. I do not recommend this product."
1,Cheap and not as described,"Got the shoes nd they are horribly tight , these are def not the size ordered. The material is very cheap. In the process of returning the shoes nd will not buy these again. Far from comfortable."
5,Great work shoes!,"I am on my feet ten hours a day, and these shoes are amazing. My feet do not hurt at all and they dont slide around the hard concrete floors. I highly recommend these shoes."
4,Work shoes,I bought these shoes for my daughter who works in a restaurant. These are Sketchers women's work shoes. She told me they are like walking on a cloud compared to her old shoes. Those were also Sketchers but they were four years old. That's not bad for a work shoe. I give it four stars. It would have been five but I always find Amazon.com to be somewhat of a nightmare! They are certainly not user friendly for those of us who are not very computer litterate.
1,These shoes hurt!!!,"I am very disappointed in these shoes as they seem to run narrow and as a result my feet feel cramped and extremely sore. I work on my feet all day and therefore need a good non slip shoe that also offers lots of support. These shoes are great at the non slip part but that's all. I am now going to have to invest in another pair of shoes asap and consider the money I spent on these Sketchers lost, as I won't return after wearing them for a week or so - scuffed and stretched out. My feet hurt at just the thought of putting these shoes on again. I would NOT buy them."
4,Sketchers Black Women's shoes,Haven't really worn them a lot yet. But they look great and appear very comfortable. They will be a great asset for work. Great deal.
3,Okay,"These shoe run small. They are so tight not very cushiony either. However the great thing about them is they are definitely skid free, they are great in that department."
5,sketchers softie,"These shoes are amazing. They are my first pair of work shoes that did not have to be broken in.These are great if you work on your feet all day, it's like walking on air. You can not gowrong purchasing these shoes."
4,good work shoe,"Sketchers makes the most non-skid shoes.These aren't fashionable, but they do the job.Price is reasonable, and they last."
1,SKECHERS FOR WORK WOMEN'S SOFT STRIDE=SOFTIE LACE UP,"WAS NOT WHAT THEY HAD SAID, HURT FEET, HAD TO SEE DR......NOT FOR WAITRESSING, THEREFORE HAD TO BE RETURNED...ESPECIALLY AFTER PAYING DR. BILL"
3,OK,"This book had great potential. The movie had a character oriented enough story that MS. Dillard could have given us something in the way of a back story, or some character development, except in the very beginning. She is going downhill. She did an excellent job with Star Trek 5 and 6. Those were very good books, better than average for star trek books, and not bad even for regular books. Then with Generations and First contact, she still did an ok job, but they were short and had large print. In this one it is lacking development to the point of deficiency, and where are the color photos from the movie. Also, the best part of the previous two STTNG movie novelizations was the behind the scenes at the end. Where did that go. Not only is this book more expensive, but it also lacks that whichj made the others readable. By the way this book is 284 not 385 pages."
5,Love it! Do all episodes show up on Collections?,"We love this collection and have become Mythbuster addicts!My question: If I own Mythbusters Collections 1 though 7, do I own all the released episodes? Or were any of episodes released in the Seasons sets and not the Collections sets?"
5,A great collection!,"This is a great way to get the best episodes without having to buy an entire season, which is VERY expensive. We love the collection and think it was a fun way to get a variety!"
4,Hotel California is the best......,.........song on this cd by far. It's an acoustic version that just sounds beautiful! The rest of this cd is also pretty damn good.
4,Good Stuff,"I had heard this version of Hotel California before and bought the CD specifically for that song. Fortunately, all the others are pretty good too. The quality of the recording is very good - more like a studio recording than live (except for the crowd noise at beginning and end of each track)."
5,"103.50 stars! I'd do it again, and again, and again.....","My apologies for the misprint on the name, Bob (from Boston)."
3,Should have asked questions.,The CD was listed as acceptable and I knew it was used but the last three tracks won't play at all.
1,Poor delivery,"Ordered the ""Hell Freezes Over"" cd and it did deliver as scheduled. However, the cd was cracked, really nasty finger prints, smudge marks etc all over the cd. It did not even play past the 5th track."
2,"Okay Guys, It's Okay To Tap Your Feet","A disappointing collection that does not add too much to their existing catalog. The live cuts are fairly lifeless copies of the originals. The band appears to be going through the motions (Live Eagles actually moving? What a concept!). Stick with the original albums, especially ""Hotel California""."
2,Waht happend to Joe Walsh material?????,"have the DVD of this show, great show but the CD doesnt have Joe Walsh`s song, too bad or this would have been a better write up.... Eagles were great in there hey day but its over now, pack it in guys..... should have done alot more of the oldies.... new stuff aint cutting the mustard......"
2,OVER RATED!!! OVER PAID!!! NOT ALL THAT TO MUCH FOR TICKETS,FOR A BUNCH MILLIONAIRE ROCK STARS THIS SHOULD OF BEEN ALOT BETTER! GREAT SONGWRITTERS SHOULD NOT REST ON PREVIOUS LAURELS!HENDLEY AND FREY HAVE BECOME THE AMERICAN BEATLES.WHAT A JOKE!! HA HA . JOE WALSH HAS CARRIED THIS BAND FOR YEARS.HIS ADDITUDE TOWARDS LIFE WAS CLASSIC. THIS REUNION TOOK HIM AWAY FROM US. WHERE HAVE YOU GONE JOE?
2,Bit of a yawn zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"How many times do i hear their songs on the radio.Id rather sit outside and watch the grass grow than listen to this CD.I was going to give it one star,but as i was falling to sleep after reading the track listing i accidently clicked 2 stars and was too tired to change it back.The only song worth half a star is Hotel California.Desperado is pure boring.Oh man im going to have to finish writing this review before i doze off."
5,Eagles - Hell Freezes Over DTS CD,"This CD has a lot of their classics in a live version. It's very good including Take It Easy and Desperado, which I particularly liked live. I wish there were more DTS audio discs out there."
4,Great Live Album Comprising Old And New Hits!,"This superb live album was the event of the year when it was released, based more on the fact that the individual members of the former super-group had likened their chances to reforming as a group was as likely as the title. Well, all things are possible to those who wait, and our wait has been rewarded with a richly textured and memorable effort that covers many of their best previous songs as well as several new ones. Thus we trip from ""Tequila Sunrise"" to ""Hotel California"", from ""New York Minute"" to ""Desperado"", and from ""Take It Easy"" to ""Life In The Fast Lane"". The simple fact that they are out there creating and working together gives one hope for future works, and given other recent efforts like ""A Hole In The Sky"", it appears they are again gathering and recording. Hope we don't have to wait for Hell to freeze over again. Enjoy!"
4,with one certain ommision,"simply outstanding C.D. It is easy to relate with the powerful words spoken on ""Get Over It"" and the amazing acoustic version of ""Hotel California. Don Henley and the boys never sounded better. I had the great opourtunity to see Eagles back in the 1970's, and this great C.D. brought back some great memories. My only complaint is this: While this is in all fairness a greatest hits compliation, why the obvious ommision of ""New Kid In Town,"" which has some of the tightest harmonies in the Eagles recordings. Defenitely for both the long time fans of the Eagles, and for the new generation who may be just now discovering what may be one of the best harmony rock bands of the 70's. (along with Boston, Journey, REO Speedwagon, and Queen.)"
5,This cd shows why the Eagles were awesome at their best,"Good music never dies, and good musicians also don't. This music brought back good times, good memories, and pointed out that rock will never die! Get Over It absolutely is a song that you can't help having a reaction to, and all the other songs follow suit! If this mix does'nt get you going, then you have no soul! The dvd of this is also not to be missed-we have been playing it at work! Altogether, what a fun ride!!!"
4,Legends of Rock,This is a out-take from the DVD and is missing a few songs and is in a different order than the DVD. Otherwise it's very good.
3,Hell Freezes Over Eagles,"I own most of the Eagles Music of years past and this is a good example of their music, having come back together after a long Haiteus from working together. They play their old hits and some more stuff they have come up with to keep it interesting for them."
4,Good mix of live and studio hits.,This CD has great songs with a good mix of studio and live music. Particularly love the live version of Hotel California.
4,great cd,"I'm still experiencing the cd so the jury is still out ,but so far on the few songs that i played ,all good so far."
3,Four New Studio Songs and Eleven Live Tracks From 1994.,"The four new songs, Get Over It (the world dosen't owe you a living), Love Will Keep Us Alive (love song), The Girl From Yesterday (another love song) and Learn To Be Still (the title says it all) are all better than I expected, as I had not heard anything by The Eagles since the 1970s.Now the live tracks, a massive favourite, Hotel California, on this occasion is not to my liking, being sung far to slow, loosing all it's bite and drive.Wasted Time, Pretty Maids All In A Row and I Can't Tell You Why are OK (maybe because they are slower songs anyway) and to my mind The Last Resort and especially, Take It Easy, are excellent reditions.I can't give more than 3 stars, much as I enjoy the 1970s Eagles recordings."
5,great package,"The Eagles almost full length live album is pure brilliance. The four first tracks are new and 'Get Over It' is a fast paced masterpiece. My favourite song on this album would have to be 'New York Minute' but the Eagles prove they KNOW how to put on a live show. Their live versions of 'Tequila Sunrise', 'Hotel California', 'Take It Easy' and 'In The City' are fantastic. One of the best albums ever to grace my CD collection."
4,Great Album,I have always liked the Eagles. I bought this CD years ago when it was first released but lost the CD along the way via military transfers. Got it again...the sound of the songs is incredible. Passionate--live--and sounds good!
4,Amazing Concert...,"...and the studio tracks ain't half bad either.""Get Over It"" is a real rocker. ""Love Will Keep Us Alive"" and ""The Girl From Yesterday"" are very country-sounding, but still good tracks. ""Learn To Be Still"" is an excellent song. All four of these prove that the Eagles still have it.The remainder of the album are live tracks. Wow, what a show! The intro to ""Hotel California,"" as others have mentioned, is easily the stand out piece on the disc. It proves so well how much Don Felder is missed in more modern Eagles concerts. Other highlights include the rocking ""Life in the Fast Lane,"" a beautiful ""Desperado"" as the finale, and a great version of ""Take it Easy.""If you are interested in live Eagles, this is the one to start with (and rarely do I say that about reunion concerts). An excellent show indeed."
3,Good!,"Good selection of songs, but missing a few personal favorite Eagles songs. This CD does contain a version of Hotel California that all fans must own. Worth the 6 bucks paid in it self!"
5,Hell Freezes Over,Pure entertainment at its best. It is quite obvious how much The Eagles love their music.
2,Premature debut with some good beats,"Despite showing some potential, Juelz Santana fails to live up to the standard set by fellow Diplomat Cam'ron in his attempt as a solo artist. Although Juelz has some charisma and style, it's not nearly enough to carry his music. His flow is subpar (at times he just talks), and his lyrics range from juvenile to cliche to incoherent babbling at times, as if someone were recording his responses to an inkblock test. The production is outstanding at times, on tracks such as ""Dipset."" However, the production of Cam'ron, Jazze Pha, Heatmakerz usually doesn't compensate for Juelz's inconsistency. Juelz Santana should've waited longer before dropping his debut. He may develop into a capable solo artist in the next few years, but Santana isn't quite ready to take the stage alone. ""From Me to U"" has a few tight beats, but it's really not worth $14 dollars unless you have a bag of money to burn."
5,A great Debut,"Now if you are a true hip hop fan you should know that Juelz Santana's first official Debut Single was him featured in Oh Boy, and his debut album, you can say are his mixtapes, unless you don't wanna count that, and if you don't wanna count Diplomatic Immunity, which is a Diplomat CD. Then this is Santana's real official Debut.Not a Bad CD, at all, I can not honestley say whether this or Diplomatic Immunity is better, because this CD has some real hot tracks. Like #10 Why, #13 Santana's Town, #15 Squalie and a couple of others, this is a standard Diplomat like album, Money,Hoes,and stuff like dat, but I ain't much a fan of that type of rap, but this is a really good album and I reccomend it to any rap fans, and also for ya'll dats wondering it only has about 15 or 16 Songs.But it has 20 Tracks in total but not 21 and the reason I said 15 or 16 is because it has alot of skits in it as in Diplomatic Immunity."
3,If You Like the diplomats then you will like this.....,"The new Juelz, which was on my list of "" must gettems"" kind of dissapoints me. I can listen to it, but thats because I'm a diplomats fan and I like everything they put out. Most of the songs I have already heard from previous mixtapes and there is only really 8 out of 16 I haven't heard. Even though the beats are tight, it doesn't have that super catchy hit like ""Oh Boy"" or ""My Love"", ""Hey Ma"". I feel sorry for the new Juelz fans who haven't heard all of his work because this ablum doesn't show the skills he displays on the diplomats mixtapes. And I thought it would have the best Diplomats song ever on it ""You ought to know"" but it doesn't and if your not a heavy Diplomats fan, your missing out."
3,very good,"Juelz is awesome. i wish he'd come out with another one already. dip set! what's even better is his album called ""What The Game's Been Missing."""
3,Not What I Expected,"I picked up this CD having only heard Juelz' work with Purple City, and the single S.A.N.T.A.N.A. (which in case you're wondering is not on the album). The lyrics are gansgta, but a lot of the beats are too soft, and don't match up well. There are some notable acceptions, such as ""Dipset"" and ""Okay Okay"", but for the most part I found the album a let-down."
5,Best Album of the Summer,"The Cd is really hot. You have to hear what the man Juelz is about. That mane is soo real, hands down best cd i have gotten this summer....Better yet best cd i have gotten in the past couple of years!"
5,Pure Piff,This album is completely bangin from beginning to end. If you can't get into the album then you might consider backtracking and get the Final Destination Mixtape. Juelz is the new quota of hip hop. As for the album itself you couldn't ask for greater debut.
3,Yeah Yeah Yeah !!!! ( 3.5 ),"Yo I like Juelz and the Dips. Diplomatic Immuntiy was a hot album, and if you liked that, you'll be diggin' this too. The production on this album is crazy which I've come to expect from the Dipset crew. Heatmakerz really blaze this album with their soulful, base dropping, sometimes choppy style. I really like those cats. Santanas flow takes some getting used to. Sometimes he just pulls words out of his ass to rhyme, and that isn't what makes a dope emcee. For the most part though, the way he flips words, and rocks to the beat will satisfy most. Overall this is a pretty good debut album from Juelz, and I can't wait for his next album. Peace"
4,Hot,"this album by no means is a classic. sick,but not to that status. Juelz shows why he the second to come out. his lyrical arsen is set up. his style is a great and openly accept change up. he sounds like no one and no one sounds like him. he should go gold if not platinum. but who knows."
4,good stuff!!,"If you like Cam'ron you will like this cd. Santana has alot of the same style and flow. Cam'ron features on a few of the songs on the cd as well. Some of the good songs on the cd are, ""One day I smile"", ""Down"", ""Lets go"", and ""My love (Remix) with Cam'ron"" Like I said it's got the Cam'ron beats and flow but he also brings his own style too. Also check out the Diplomats cd!"
2,"Not bad, Not great","This album is OK. The rhymes aint the best they could be, fo sho, but the beats r fine. I couldnt say that u'd absolutely hate this album n u'd wanna burn it asap, but i wuldnt say that ud b totally satisfied wit it. So if you've got a few xtra bucks in ur pocket that u just dont give about, go out n buy the album but if ur broke, dont waste ur dough on it. If Santana could write up a bit betta lyrics, he'd b lots better than he is on this album."
2,IT REALLY SUCKS,"WHAT REALLY GOOD MY NAME SHAKHIA I EXCEPT BETTER FROM JUELZ SANTANA.THIS ALBUM IS (...) BORING AND IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY SONG IS ABOUT THE SAME THING.DON'T GET ME WRONG JUELZ SANTANA IS TALENTED,SEXY AND HAS HIS WAY WITH THE CROWD.BUT I AM REALLY DISAPPOINTED AT THIS ALBUM MAYBE HE WILL DO BETTER NEXT TIME."
4,The whole Byrd Gang is here,"Juelz Santana, whether you like it or not is as good as anybody else in the game except, 50, Jayz, Nas and people like that. You have to remember the Diplomats are a mixtape group. They don't aim for the radio or pop type music.ReviewFrom Me to U didn't measure up to Cam'ron's album, but it was average. When it comes to the way the Diplomats flo, you have to give them credit. They have started a new style which I like. It may be hard to tolerate that flo every song, but it still is original. Really, I don't know what some of you are thinking about. Juelz Santana has some pretty good lyrics. ex. ""You F^*ks probably don't know if they cut off the bridges, we be stuck here force to live on the island.""(track 3)For the many of you that might not understand this phrase, would be the reason why you say he isn't a lyricist. Holla at cha boyIf you like the rest of the Diplomats, for sure by this album. If your not a fan, borrow the CD and burn the songs you like."
1,I received a different product.,"I received a different product. this was not my order.I bought: ""Animale By Animale Parfums For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Ounces""and received:"" Animale Animale By Animale Parfums For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Ounces"""
5,"most comfortable, secure bandage",this bandage is very flexible and sticks very well to the skin. Removes easily without pulling the skin upon removal.
2,Disappointing,"I picked this book out of the new books section of the local public library. Several aspects of the book were a disappointment. First of all, it was too long. The story could have easily been told as a short story, instead of a rather painfully protracted novella. Secondly, I had rather expected the author to teach me something new about the era in which the historical novel took place. That didn't happen; Having read the book I now know absolutely nothing that I didn't already know about Norman England. Thirdly, the characters were superficial, wooden, and rather remarkably peevish, most of them flying off the handle on the spur of the moment for no clear reason. Lastly, the dialogue sounded contrived and unbelieveable, even supposing it to be a representation of people speaking a thousand years ago. Sorry, but I found the book to be a tedious bore."
4,The Real Never Ending Story,"The last (?) descendant of Dom Manuel confronts the past to discover reality. Cabell's ""average"" (i.e. classical) exercise in urban wit, devious language and human puzzlement. This is a doorway to the past and all the other books of the History."
5,Works great,"I loved getting SolarOil at the local spa. It smells great and helps my nails to grow. However, the spa went to another product that just doesn't work as well, so I am now buying my own stuff. Thank you Amazon.com"
2,donab,If my ridged chipping peeling problem is due to dryness this did not help but did smooth out my cuticles and certainly smells good. So guess I would say it did not perform as promised.
4,Good product,"I use the solar oil about once a day, I like it. I don't have anything to compare it to as I've never used anything previously. Smells good."
5,The Very Best,"Works better than I ever thought it would. I work with paper all day long, which dries my cuticles very badly. After just a few days of applying this twice a day they are back to looking normal. I still apply about every other day. Usually at night watching TV, so it has time to soak in with out my hands getting wet."
3,disappointing,"I bought this after much research on cuticle oils, and this products was made to sound like a ""miracle"" tonic. I can't see were it works any better if as good as some other oils that I have gotten at the local discount store"
5,Great Product for my Cuticles,I bought two bottles of this wonderful product. I keep one at work to use during the day since I wash my hands numerous times. Helps tremendously with the great condition of my cuticles between manicures.
4,"Exact product, picture misleading","The picture shows the larger round bottle, this is actually a more petite bottle the size of a nail polish bottle.That aside, it arrived lightning fast, unbroken, and is the high quality product I expected. My dry nails drink it up."
5,Love this stuff,Non greasy and really absorbs into the skin fast. I had really dried out cuticles and nails that made my nails look ugly no matter what type of poish I used. This stuff may seem pricey for some but it last a long time because all u need is a little bit. I read a review that said if u don't use this product everyday that your skin n cuticles will begin to peel. That is true. I didn't use it for like 3 days n the skin around my cuticles began to peek. Not very bag but enough to look ugly. Other tha that I love this stuff.
5,Amazing potion!!,"My friend turned me on to Solar Oil, and I must say, the stuff is awesome! I have the world's ugliest hands. My cuticles are always a wreck. Nothing has ever helped until this. It seems to penetrate and soften in a way no product ever has. Also, my nails seem to be stronger and have stopped peeling. My thumb nails had vertical ridges, and they have smoothed out, too.I will be keeping a bottle of Solar Oil forever. I am tempted to buy a lifetime supply now, just in case it's ever discontinued. If you have problem cuticles and nails, here is the solution. So glad I bought it!"
3,Riding Between Worlds,"Though overall this book is too ""new age"" for my taste, I believe Ms. Kohanov probably does a tremendous amount of good pairing horses with people and solving inner or repressed emotional conflicts at her ranch in Tucson, and in the clinics she presents. I found the examples she sited very believable for both horse and person, and truly believe horses can heal emotional wounds. I very much agree ""it is never JUST a horse!"" Horses reveal our deepest secrets and conflicts, they sense these before we even can give them words. I liked, and I promptly employed, the technique of telling my horses things about my life that I believe make me similar to each one. The horse always listens, and the verbalization is good for both. This book adds understanding to our relationship with horses by making the reader more aware of what the horse ""knows"" or senses immediately about us, and thus makes us more open to the horse."
5,Love this book!!,"This book is a fantastic follow up to the Tao of Equus! That book was fascinating, and this kicks it up a notch! I was delighted to see that Ms. Kohanov referred to Elaine Aron's book on Highly Sensitive People. While reading the Tao of Equus, that book kept popping up in my mind --it is so relevant to the discussion! It confirms my thought that pursuing a future in Equine Facilitated Therapy might be a good fit for me. I am very grateful to both authors for their groundbreaking work!"
5,Human-horse connections can provide invaluable models,"From the usual basics of the practice to more unique chapters on correct breathing and posture, this covers a world of detail. Linda Kohanov's Riding Between The Worlds: Expanding Our Potential Through The Way Of The Horse explores a new kind of therapy which blends psychology and spirituality with a love of horses. Human-horse connections can provide invaluable models for growth and understanding, and enthusiasts will appreciate a direct assessment of these connections."
5,Remembering a love of horses,"Reading this book and the Tao of Equus got me back to riding again. I've always loved horses, but felt that I was too old, too out of shape, too inept. Reading these books and absorbing the wisdom made me get out of my chair and start lessons again. So here I am, over 50, trotting around a ring escorted by mostly 12 and 13 year olds,who are far better than me, loving every minute of it.The way Linda Kohanov researched this subject was very apparent in the way she was able to present other people's work, such asKarla McLaren's theories on emotions. She tied it all together for me. For anyone who wants to learn to be real, authentic, and loving..this is your book."
4,A good book,This is a good book although it is not as good as the first one. It had quite a bit of repetition in it especailly in the beginning. I realize the whole point of the book was to use personal examples that illustrated the theory behind the Tao of Equus. The stories were very good and did accomplish the aforesaid goal but there was still more fluff in this book than in the first one. I would definitely recommend it though as it does have more new insights within. It's just not quite on a par with Tao of Equus.
1,Boring,After reading the sample of Tao of Equus I decided not to read it. I should have done the same with Riding Between the Worlds. If you are looking for a book on personal psychology this is a book for you. If you are looking for a book about horses this might not be the book for you. I have really tried but I just can't even finish this book. Too much about messed up people and not enough about horses.
5,très bons albums,"J'ai acheté ce double album et comme tous les autres que Daniel a déjà produit, il est formidable.Je suis du Québec, Canada et je suis fan de Daniel depuis que je l'ai vu sur PBS au mois de mars 2004"
1,Review of Krups FEM2W 2 slice toaster.,I was very dissapointed in the toaster. I put a piece of toast in and it only browned on one side. I returned the toaster for a full refund.
4,Good Toaster,"I have the 4 slice version of this toaster and it's great. My dad has often commented on how much he likes it, so for I gave it to him for Christmas. It's just as great as the 4 slice with all the same features. Works great. Wouldn't buy any other brand. Also, the white and stainless looks great - just as good as the black and stainless. Highly recommend."
1,awful Krups toaster,Never buy this toaster it is junk. It toasted only one side of the bread (for $72.00)and died shortly after it arrived.I had to take it to a repair shop in a distant town (50 miles R/T)They didn't repair it instead they ordered another new toaster from Krups.I called Krups for a refund. It was denied because it was one day late (31 days after the purchase instead of 30 days)After a few weeks the second one arrived.......deja vous........same problem. Another 50mile R/T to return #2 waited a few weeks to receive #3 KRUPS toaster. Same deal....one side bread....toaster died.I was extremely frustrated when Amazon intervened. Krups refunded my $.Now I always buy through Amazon. That way I am protected from sellers who will take advanatage.PS I bought a toaster at Bartells for $19.00. It toasts on only one side. That's just fine.
1,Horrible! VERY DISAPPOINTING,Don't let the release date fool you. This is an older version of Strawberry Shortcake which cannot hold a candle to the new ones. The movie disappointed everyone and went directly into the garbage can.
5,Enchanting and unusual!,"I love this album! But it's not typical, bland Christmas background music. So if you like renaissance music and interesting-sounding instruments (krumhorns and bagpipes elicit a similar response in people), then I encourage you to order this cd. I own another one by Ethan James, and my 18-month old especially gets into that hurdy-gurdy buzz!"
2,Two stars for a good idea,"This CD represents a well-crafted effort by a talented musician who has used medieval music and instruments in many intriguing past rock-oriented projects. I thought it seemed like a great idea and hunted for the CD as soon as I heard about it. That said...every time I played the CD, the other people in the room begged me to turn it off by track two. I'm not exaggerating. The hurdy-gurdy here seems to set up a rackety mid-range buzz that is one of those sonic equivalents to nails on a chalkboard. And yes, I have heard other hurdy-gurdy recordings and found them completely tolerable. Original projects like this are rare and commendable, but I felt I had to warn anyone who was looking for pleasant holiday background music -- this isn't what you want."
5,The best hurdy-gurdy album ever!,"Ethan James was a guiding light in the world of hurdy-gurdy music, most particularly medieval and renaissance. He was also a very generous-hearted man, who would spend an hour on long distance talking an unknown hysterical novice through the wilderness of hurdy-gurdy maintenance. This album is thrilling, and shows the breadth of his ability on the instrument. The music selections are well chosen and stirring; his use of the chien producing some very spectacular counter-rhythms. He left us too soon."
5,Ethan James,Excellent album. Great range of tunes interpreted creatively by Ethan James. You could easily miss the Christmas theme but that wouldn't matter. A fascinating instrument played exceptionally well.
5,His Real Album,"After listening to ""Into The Fire"" countless times, I almost cried when I listened to ""Waking Up the Neighbors."" Bryan Adams always manages to put on two or three good songs on any CD, but ""Into The Fire"" has solid song writing up through the closign track. This is NOT Springsteen or Mellencamp but really much better."
3,a bomb?...I think not,"this abum got poor reviews when it came out in '87. it had three hits, ""heat of the night""- great true adams material and ""victom of love""-is the sleeper hit, a great song. and one minor hit.""rebel"" should be heard by Rodger Daltrey, and not adams. the album does have some real dud though. Not a place to start for new bryan adams fans."
3,Grade C-,"INTO THE FIRE was to be Bryans big cd, not just sales wise, but musicaly. He was to get the respect of that the other two artist in gene wer getting, Springsteen, and Mellencamp. But this cd did neither. HEAT OF THE NIGHT was the only big hit off the cd, and most people, other than Bryan Adams' fans, may not rememeber this song or cd. Adams wanted to be know for what his music had to say, other than having a fun rockin cd. And what he came off saying was boring, not that his topics were, but the music that it was set to, made it so. He had lost the fire that he played with or his last two cds, or maybe that it was the production was not as crisp as before, anyway the cd is far less than his last two, RECKLESS, and CUTS LIKE A KNIFE. But that is not to say that there isn't any thing worth listening to on this cd, INTO THE FIRE, HEARTS ON FIRE, VICTIM OF LOVE, & HEAT OF THE NIGHT. I just can't listen to the others. Spent your money elsewhere."
4,Three Thousand Years of Chinese Painting,"THE BOOK IS VERY DETAILED WITH LARGE LITERATURE, VERY USEFULL ALSO FOR COLLECTORS, BUT THE CRONOLOGICAL INDEX I ONLY ORDEREDBY CHINESE DYNASTY AND NOT ALFABETIC."
4,A life in 609 pages...,"Minutely researched, Richard Schickel really did his homework. Griffith emerges as an intriguing, if not altogether engaging, character. He seems to have been the first to understand what was to become the accepted language of popular cinema. For example, he showed that intercutting two sequences (a house on fire and the approaching fire engine) would not confuse an audience.What I missed was more background in the world surrounding Griffith, Hollywood is so briefly sketched that one is left thinking Griffith worked in a vacuum. But maybe that's the point, he chose not to see how the feature film was developing around him.Schickel lays to rest several myths about Griffith but seems unsure quite what note to strike about his racism. In the end Griffith remains a rather distant character.When Griffith dies on p.604 it's relief and as someone you are intrigued, but not engaged, by you can't help feeling he got what he deserved."
2,oh no!,"This CD is really good untill about the 5th track where it sort of turns into like 80's Cosby Show chamber music with vocals by the Lion King cast. It is really awful. and stupid sounding. It picks back up around track 12, but it's not worth buying in my opinion. I traded mine back in for store credit just today."
5,works as advertised,"Not much to say other than it works as advertised. Didn't spend the money for the wolverine jig, just the vari-grind with my home made jig. Works perfectly."
3,Not satisfactory,"I used this book in an Introducion to Solid State Physics course, and although I found subjects were well-described and complete, the text was hard to comprehense and quite poorly written.My professor explained that there are few books that teach Solid State Physics on this level, and that of those books this one may be the best there is. I found it hard to learn from, even though the quality of the information in this book is high."
1,I didn't learn a single thing.,"I had this textbook for one of my fourth year undergrad courses. It seemed that Hook & Hall know what they are talking about, but they certainly couldn't explain it to me. Perhaps this text may be useful for graduate studies or as a reference, but I could not recommend it for an introductory course to solid state physics."
3,Great Photos But...,"Fantastic photos that your baby will probably really enjoy! The only problem is that the book is ridiculously short. The ""Super Chubby"" series by Neil Ricklen is worth checking out. His books have three times as many photos and are usually a buck less. Granted, the photos are larger and better in Margaret Miller's books, but you might feel a bit resentful about how few pages you get for the price."
5,An Enduring Favorite,"I originally picked this up at a book store, flipped through it, and was about to put it down, when my five month old son laughed. I looked. He was laughing at the faces of the babies -- they delighted him -- so, I bought the book! Ten months, and at least that many new books later, this is still one of Jack's all-time favorites and a guaranteed source of giggles, even after all this time. (We read it at least two or three times a day, at Jack's insistance. )This was the first book we saw Jack ""reading"" to himself -- turning pages and naming the expressions all by himself. It has contribute several new signs to his vocabulary and several words, too!I highly recommend it! It's fun, it's beautiful, and as a bonus it also helps to start baby on the road to emotional intelligence! (People's facial expressions have meaning.)"
3,Baby Faces book - only about 5 pictures!,Not as big as I thought it would be...definitely more suited for younger babies like 6-9 months old. Once they are moving around they become more fascinated with everything else vs. baby faces in a book. So I waited too long! (got this for my daughter for xmas and she was 13 months at the time and was walking at 11 months). Also quite small (only about 5 pages) but I suppose for their small attention spans it's probably just the right size!
2,disappointed,I received this book as a gift for my 7-mo old son and must say that I'm disappointed. Most of the children aren't very expressive and there are too few positive emotions on display.
2,Disappointed,"This book doesn't offer very many cute faces. The color rendering is intended to be bright and saturated but is instead dull and the hues are inaccurately rendered. I bought this book because my 7 month old son likes all baby pictures he sees in magazines, etc., but this book doesn't interest him. Blah! Stay away from this one."
2,sad faces,"The expressions on the children's faces in this book really lean toward sad and worried. I'm not sure why there aren't more smiling babies here. The photos are good, but I'd rather my infants saw fewer ""boo hoo"" and ""uh oh"" expressions and more giggly and happy ones."
2,Pictures don't match text,"The pics are adorable and multi-ethnic which is great, but the text that goes with them often doesn't match the child's expression. So the book doesn't serve as a learning tool in all the ways I'd hoped."
2,"Few faces, mostly negative","I was disappointed with this board book. It has very few baby faces (only 6!), and most of them portray disgust or sadness. I think that my baby would have enjoyed more happy faces. One upside is that there is great ethnic diversity in the babies portrayed."
1,My baby cries every time,"I guess it's just my baby who's like this, because I read all the rave reviews about how everyone else's babies love looking at these types of books. So I ordered this one and another baby face book. My baby boy is 8 months old and cries every time we open this book. I don't know if it's because it doesn't have enough ""happy"" faces or if he just doesn't like looking at other babies right now??? I chose this one because it seemed ethnically diverse and I wanted my baby to be accustomed to seeing all types of faces. But the ""yucky"" face and ""boo hoo"" face make him cry every time. Even if I try to start with the ""yippee"" face, which is the last page, he's still unsure if he likes it...then as soon as I flip to the other faces, he immediately starts crying. Not fake crying either...real crying with crocodile tears and all. So this book will live on the shelf. Darn, really wanted my boy to like this."
1,Too many sad faces...,"We bought this for our 3 month old daughter because one of the only ways to keep her happy in the car is to flip through a book and let her stare at the pictures. She likes looking at babies, so we thought this would be great. Unfortunately as other reviewers have stated, almost all of the babies in this book have negative words associated with their faces (yucky, stinky, sad etc). Staring at these faces does not make my daughter happy. I flipped through the negative ones as quickly as possible only to find almost all of the pictures were negative. As others have stated, the two pictures that are not negative (yum yum and yipee) do not have particularly positive or expressive faces either. My daughter stared at the word 'yipee' without even glancing at the face next to it. This book was a big disappointment. This is the first book my daughter hasn't seemed at all interested in."
1,Are all babies unhappy babies?,"I bought this book because it was recommended as a good book for babies to look at other baby's faces. I was not happy with it because it most of the descriptions of the various baby faces are negative, like ""stinky"" ""uh-oh"" etc. I had a hard time explaining to my 3 y.o. daughter why each of the babies was unhappy and my 3 month old son didn't give a darn about the faces. I'll be passing this book along quickly."
5,Our Son's Favorite,This is our son's favorite book. He's 8 months old andlaughs every time he sees the faces in the book.When we pick up the book he crawls right over to seeit. We highly recomend this book as well as MargaretMiller's other books. They're a hit with our kids.
2,Low on Gary's CD....but love him still,"Very disappointed in this selection. I know Gary has done better work than this in his early years. Very slow & boring. Better works could have been selected..I am sure. Just saw Gary Live w Pat Metheny. He played some early stuff...terrific. Maybe this CD should have been titled ""Workin On It""."
3,Rather dry,"I read a lot, mostly nonfiction, so I was really looking forward to this book. It is definitely scholarly, well-researched and has well-thought-out information.But the style is so dry, so pedantic, that it's hard to stay interested in it, which disappoints me. I was really looking for further information and insights into Paul's life, and was ready to dive into this book, but after reading the first chapter, I laid it down and haven't picked it up again.I'll probably finish it eventually, after I've read everything else that I'd planned to read this summer. At least it will be good to have when I need something to help me sleep."
5,Paul; a Jew in a Hellenistic world,If you are interested in Paul then I would highly recommend this book; it's another stone for the foundation.This book does a good job examining Paul's conversion and his experience in a Hellenistic social setting.
5,Book on Paul the Apostle,"I love this book!! This was an assignment for World Civ, but it was the best book I think I have ever read as an assignment. I wouldn't have read it had it not been brought to my attention by the instructor. Boy, I would have really missed some good stuff. Read this book."
1,PAUL FAIL ? ANOTHER VIEW.,You said Paul largely failed ? Paul was led by the Holy Spirit of God; his ministry was a total success all the way to his being beheaded in Rome; his last breath here was his first breath in the presence of Jesus; he was the author of about 13 of the NT Books; all were inspired of God; there is no failure when you do the will of God; and all he did was the will of God; if it came out of his mouth; it was given to him to say from the Holy Spirit; there is no error in the bible.
3,A Bit Disappointed,My newly 1 year old loves Elmo and his Sesame Street friends. I was so excited to find a book that combined the theme of her birthday and Elmo in a book with textures (another favorite).I was disappointed with the variety and number of pics with textures when I received the book. We kept the book and my daughter pages through it - maybe I just had too high of expectations.
3,Not bad.,"Maggie Swanson (illus.), Elmo's Birthday Party (Random House, 2002)This is one of those tactile-experience books aimed at the youngest of the pre-lit set, where there are cutouts in each page with a different fabric underneath. They certainly serve a purpose (and I am willing to give this one full marks because unlike most Sesame Street-branded books this one actually contains enough relevant meta information to write a competent review!), but kids will outgrow them pretty quick, and the dearth of space doesn't leave much room for the writer to come up with a compelling story to keep mom and dad's attention. Let the baby be the guide here. ***"
3,A little disappointed!,Received this book today. Disappointed that the cover was scribbled on but I don't think my 2y/o granddaughter will notice. All the other books were in perfect shape. If that was explained in the description then I missed it!Elmo's Birthday Party (Touch-and-Feel)
5,Baby boy loves it!,"Been reading it to our baby boy, who is now 10 months old, in preparation for his upcoming first birthday. And he absolutely loves it! He loves to feel the items and giggles at the last page! Absolute treasure!"
1,Making non-standard cabinets maybe,This book was not at all what it is described as. It is not how to make standard American kitchen cabinets. It is about making everything but! Not happy with purchase and in my opinion it is a deceptive promotional listing by Amazon and the publisher.
2,Cheap Looking Cabinets,This video is great... if you want to create cheap looking 70's cabinets. The use of plastic laminate on cabinets is archaic to say the least. While his woodworking tips are somewhat useful I found this video otherwise useless for building anything resembling quality cabinets. My wife would have my head if I built what he shows.
4,una lluvia de rosas,"This has some realy nice songs by los angeles azules. I really like the first two and the last one. they are good dance songs, they like always did a great job on this CD, This is one of my favorits."
5,I loved It.,"Pues a mi me encantan Los Angeles Azules. Son los Reyes de la cumbia Romantica. Este CD ""Una Lluvia de Rosas"" esta muy bonito. Me encanto. Se los recomiendo estoy segura que les gustara. Especialmente estas canciones, El liston de tu Pelo,Amigos Nadamas,20 rosas, y Sin ti No Se Vivir. Este CD esta padrisimo."
3,tight boots,"You may want to order one size larger than your toddler's shoe size, as these boots do not have much wiggle room. They are difficult to slide on without a zipper or drawstring to allow for some give.The construction of the boot seems warm and strong."
5,Amazing,"These boots are amazing. I don't think I'll ever buy another boot for my son. I received a hand-me-down pair for him last year. He is 5, very active, and cannot be bothered to open or close any velcro or zipper. He could slip these on, (sometimes over bare feet!) on his own and he was out the door. He loved them so much he insisted on wearing them right through spring mud season. They almost always kept his feet warm and dry--during general playing in snow and slush, including in snowdrifts, shovelling snow and most sledding (a couple of times snow got down them during sledding--I'm buying gaiters this year as I think that will happen occasionally even with the best boot/snowpants combo). This is in contrast to the kamik boots I paid for, with supposedly-waterproof nylon upper with liner which always let water in the front where the liner has a gap. I am on amazon looking for another pair for this year and hope they come in pink for my daughter too."
4,You don't always get what you pay for. . .,"This is an amazing acoustic guitar for the price, it's got great tone, looks excellent, and holds it's tune extremely well. It plays almost as well as my other guitar which was about three times the price. There is a little bit of buzzing on the low E string at times, but it's not that big of a deal. For a beginner or someone who just plays casually this is definitely worth buying."
3,Appearance problems,"I bought the RA-100D for my young son. I based my purchase mostly on the reviews and did like the sound quality. I have to admit I was very disappointed with cosmetic problems, any quality inspection would see the nicks and scratches in the finish. I hope my son doesn't think I bought the guitar second hand."
3,Haha. honestly mate,This is a okay guitar for starters but for someone like my friend Ross its pretty weak. And when you advance to his level you'll see how poor it really was unlike the new Harry Potter novel. Can you handle me?
3,descent,"I got this guitar as a birthday present, I was suprised on how it sounds, when I strummed it it was nice and smooth. But when I was looking at it, the nut was chipped, but luckily not enought for the string to pop out. I was also sad that the wood was thin, and not as sturdy as my friends. But it sounded nice, and I had a good time with it."
5,A hysterical look at cultural differences -- you can't make stuff like this up!,"Phil Rosenthal's mission to Russia is an eye-opener. The people he confronts, the situations he navigates, and the perspectives it give us into life in Russia is laugh-out-loud funny. I saw the film weeks ago, and just thinking about it makes me smile again. Whether your are a ""Raymond"" fan or not, (Everybody Loves Raymond: The Complete Series), you will enjoy watching Phil's real-life journey, and seeing comedy, television, and the media unfold through the unique Russian lens."
1,Stupid and pointless!,"You know how when you go to Paris expecting that all French are rude and end up only meeting the rude French? This is what you get when you expect every nation to have exactly the same sense of humor, the same mentality, and sensibility as your own. Especially, to someone who is looking for funny stuff, they will criticize and belittle everything they encounter.Pointless, and tiring-just not funny jewish shtik!."
4,Rockin Halloween Hootenany!,"Wow this is a great Halloween compilation!With the exception of some tracks this is a great compilation.The MC Hammer Addams Family song is hilarious and entertaining.Rock legend Santana is included on here with 'Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen'.One of my favorite bands of all time,The Charlie Daniels Band and their greatest song ever,'Devil Goes Down To Georgia'.This album is a must have!"
2,Might as well take a daily multi-vitamin,"Some of the reviews I read about this product before I purchased it compared it to Ephedra and if you Google bitter orange products they tell you how comparable it is, well its not even close. I exercise daily and I did NOT get any additional boost with this product. I would recommend not to waste your money, actually you might be better off eating the money you spend."
2,Just ok,"I bought this as a gift, this item is just ok not what I expected it to be. Power was just ok shape didnt doanything for her."
5,A reexamination of Griesbach,"Not simply a reexamination of the Griesbach / Two-Gospel theory, but a shaking to the foundations of Q and Markan priority. These 20 papers offer insights that would alter quite radically the dating of the Synopitcs and reassert traditional Matthean priority."
3,Aerosol Tech .............,The book really treat aerosol sciences very well but it does not provide much solution and insight to the question at the end of the chapters.people who have done maths a long time ago have problem solving the problems.
5,Good Book,"Is a good book, technical enough to learn a lot abput aerosols, but at the same time easy to understand."
5,A Gem!,"There are not many books on advanced computer programming that you actually want to read. Usually, the subject is so dry and full of theory that you have to force yourself. This book is the exception. Bentley's easy-to-read style makes this book a pleasure to read. His theoretical analysis is impeccable, but he presents complex topics in a chatty format that makes you remember the joy you felt the first time you wrote a program, and lets you know he still feels that way"
4,Good book,Good book for a free book. Was looking for some reading without the price. This fit the bill and was a good read.
3,free e-books,"I remember reading this author's book ""She"" many decades ago. I liked that one better, but then again, I'm older and jaded now."
4,pure escapism,this book is ok if you like old time adventure stories. it gives you a little insight into colonial life in Africa in the 1800s. I know that now it would be considered quite un-pc. but you have to put it in context of the period in which it is set and written.
3,badgerboy,"Good at the beginning, Great at the end, but a bit tedious in the middle. The romantic tension and wall between the hero and heroine was a bit unbelievable...maybe because it is dated? Man and woman faced with such danger, life and death struggles, but they cannot overcome pride and ego to share sincere emotions? When the action happened, it was very good, typical of Haggard's other works. The strained romance took away from the story. I wanted less of it and more action. Overall, a good read, and Haggard, like Edgar Rice Burroughs is a good read between other books...kind of like cleansing your palette during a multi-course meal."
4,would make a great movie!,"A wonderful book. I love that my kindle lets me know the percentage left! I stayed up on a Saturday eve til 2 in the morning just to finish this book, I wanted to know how it ended that bad!! I think this could make a great movie. I recommend PEOPLE OF THE MIST."
4,People of the mist,"Oddly reminded me of a book read many years back. SHE? It has mystery, treachary, and intrigue as well as plenty of adventure. It was an enjoyable read."
2,Boring tale of darkest Africa,"The writing is very stiff, perhaps a style intended to invoke legendary tales. I tried to get into the story but ended up scanning through the pages to see what happened. I might have enjoyed this as a teenager but it is not to my current taste. Other than the dwarfish servant (the only really interesting character in the book), I really couldn't care all that much about what happened to any of them. I didn't find the twist of fate ending particularly satisfying (but I won't spoil the story for you). The author went from excessively descriptive travelogue to blithe skipping over the details of the travelers struggles. The book would have benefited from more ""skipping over"" in my opinion."
3,The People of The Mist,"Not the type of book I normally read, but, once I got into it I enjoyed it. I would probably read something else by this author."
2,Skip's review...,"It has been a long time since I have read a really good novel and this one is no exception. My previous read involved a man and a woman during the American Civil War who throughout the entire book were at odds with each other until the end; the ""Deliverer and the Shepherdess"" were at odds thoughout this book and we knew how it was going to end, all on a happy note. Why cant authors surprise us with a turn about surprise ending? This book would have made a great Tarzan and Jane movie, just think about it. All of the elements are there for that kind of flick. All you have to do is change costumes and there you have it! I must go back to the Classics and refresh myself to what was really good reading. Sorry folks, this just wasnt my kind of book."
3,A real page turner,"Almost as good as Edgar Rice Burroughs. The characters are a little shallow, but it's not supposed to be great literature. The tale of an English Lord who loses everything and vows to leave England until he has made a fortune and regained his estate. He goes to Africa to find gold and finds more than he bargained for including love."
4,great read - good fun,"I intially downloaded this book for a my first (free) download for kindle - and then quickly found myself not able to put it down! I great page turner, good adventure story, great characters. The book is well over 100 years old, and despite some antiquated english, the themes and plots are timeless for an adventure story with lovable characters. That said, keep in mind that it was written in a different time, so the term 'savages' was easily thrown about describing africans. In any case, you won't regret picking up a copy of this classic adventure tale."
4,enjoyable read,"For those who, like myself, just want an exciting, pleasurable read, I highly recommend The People of the Mist. Others have suggested it should be made into a movie and I couldn't agree more. It has everything going for it, intrigue, adventure, danger, love. You get the idea. Get it. Read it. Enjoy it."
2,Not a large pellet by any means. Un-eaten food will make aquarium stink!,"Basicaly what the title says. They say its a large pellet for large fish but id like to see their version of a large fish. Any un-eaten food will get lodged in the gravel and is only removable by gravel vacuum. Even a small ammount un-eaten will make the aquarium start to emit a sickly-pungent odor of garlic and fish water, absolutely depleting any carbon or chemi-pure in your system unless taken care of the same day you notice the smell starting to form. This happened only after 4 days with a very small ammount of food fed per day. My oscar absolutely stopped touching it and spits it out. The only reason why i give this product a 2-star rating is because my red-devil tank loves it. but keep in mind that tank has no gravel for the food to get caught in."
5,Best Monkees Book Ever Written!,"This is the greatest book ever written about The Monkees. It tells you everything you ever wanted to know and more. Andrew Sandoval is the ultimate Monkees historian, like what Mark Lewisohn is to The Beatles. Every Monkees fan should own this book."
2,Get an editor!,"I finally started reading this book after buying it about five years ago, and I feel the need to edit it as I read. Sentences are awkward or don't make any sense. The boxes where episodes are listed are sometimes reversed or list the wrong episode. There's no editorial consistency - Mike Nesmith is referred to as ""Mike"" and ""Nesmith"" in the same entry. Same thing for Jeff Barry, which is slightly more confusing since he isn't a Monkee and has two first names. Maybe I have an early edition and later copies were edited more carefully, but these kinds of things are extremely distracting when you're trying to read such a data-heavy book."
4,Too Much Information,"This book would merit five stars if it had been written in a narrative style and omitted most of the recording session minutiae. How many people care to read the names of every musician who played on every potential Monkees song? Who needs to see times and dates and locations of every recording session, even those where none of the Monkees were present? Who really cares that the master take of an unreleased song was made by mixing the beginning of take 2, the middle of take 7, and the ending of take 12, with extra oboe and strings overdubbed three days later? Oh yeah, it's fun to see which songs included Bud Shank or David Crosby or Glen Campbell or other well-known musicians, but the book would have been more enjoyable with less trivia and larger type. Great photos, though---except they're all black-&-white. And very little attention is given to the years after 1970. Still, the book is still a must-have for any Monkees fan."
5,monkee diaries,"great in depth, day by day accounts of monkees recording dates and concerts, detailed and entertaining, a work of love.only bummer no colour photographs. also check out the authors own recordings, which are inspired in a sixties vein, at avebury records."
2,Mosby's Review Mental Health Nursing,"As a nursing major the book was difficult to get through. Possibily due to trouble outside of school. Definitly not easy reading, but lots of good information. I recommend this for anyone who is thinking about nursing."
5,One of my favorites,"This movie is great! The characters' eccentricities all come together perfectly. Mercedes Ruehl and Irene Worth, who were both in Neil Simon's broadway production, were just as great, if not better, in this film. One thing I have always liked about film as opposed to plays is that the characters don't always have to speak loudly. In dramatic parts of this movie, especially parts between Grandma and Bella, the dialogue is much softer, adding to its sincerity. It really adds more to the scene. This movie really brings out the talents of not-so-well-known actors like Susan Merson, Mike Damus, Brad Stoll and Jack Laufer. I highly recommend seeing this movie at least once. Chances are you'll probably want to see it again."
5,how could I not love it?!,"This briliant adaptation of the Neil Simon play was filmed on the very street where I live. Mercedes Rheul and Richard Dreyfuss are stunning in their roles as are 'grandma' and the boy. For me, the warm feelings are enhanced seeing familiar sites, but what stands out most of all is the characters and their touching humanity. The DVD version is a must see bringing more scope to what was already a wonderful film."
5,Impressive,"We rented this movie and after that we knew we had to own it. It is a brilliant adaptation of the Neal Simon play and my whole family has watched it hundreds of times. It takes you through a roller coaster of emotions it has you laughing and crying, cheering for the young boys, feeling a little sorry for the aunt, and you feel good when you are done. I recommend it for anyone. You will love it."
4,Okay DVD,This is a wonderful DVD that the older generation would appreciate more than the younger generation.
4,The play is better,I bought this to show my students who had just finished reading the play in class. They were mixed and many found the play to be far more entertaining (including myself).
2,Fussy self-production. No Surprises.,"I'll never say I don't care what John Cale does. He is - unlike Lou Reed - still unpredictable. But I don't like this CD. No, not much at all. Cale produced the CD, and he has no one to blame but himself. This CD is alternately fussy, sentimental, dull, eh. Yes, eh. The best tunes are ""Dancing Undercover"" (too controlled), ""Circus"" (too cute), ""Set Me Free"" (just fine) & ""Indistinct Notion of Cool"" (beautiful). The rest just sinks into well-recorded blah. John Cale is a gamble - I'll always be a sucker to that bet. But this is easily one of his least-interesting albums. You'll find no musical adventure here."
4,Grows on you,"I enjoy listening to this CD very much. Yes, at first it seems somewhat tame, not as edgy as many of Cale's other compositions. No matter, I respect this musician. What it comes down to is that I like sound of Cale's voice and his poetry. I listen to him and wonder where he gets his inspiration.If you listen carefully, you will find a few surprises."
3,Some great moments,"John Cale is probably my favorite musician, but this album is disappointing for the most part. One hears Cale merely treading water on songs like Dancing Undercover, So Much For Love, Tell Me Why and Secret Corrida. The two brilliant exceptions are the sorrowful Set Me Free with its poetic lyrics and country-like sound, and the wistful Circus with a woman's spoken contributions in French. His lyrics are trenchant throughout, but suffers from lack of memorable tunes. Two masterpieces amongst 12 tracks thus merit this album 3 stars. But believe me, it's worth buying for Set Me Free and Circus if you're a fan of John Cale."
2,Disappointed,"I puchased two of these. One had 4 twist locks on the fitting and it worked fine. The other you short changed me on, it only had two twist lock connectors and it leaked. I was forced to go to the rv store and purchase a new 4 lock fitting and install it."
1,DON'T WORK WITH CAMCO HOSES,"WE PURCHASED THE CAMCO 20' RV SEWER HOSE. THE HOSE CAME WITHOUT CONNECTORS SO WE PURCHASED 2 PACKAGES OF THESE CONNECTORS. THREE MEN (ONE AN ENGINEER) SPENT OVER AN HOUR, HOT WATER, SOAPY WATER, SANDING DOWN THE EDGES.CALLED CAMCO DIRECT AND THEIR RESPONSE WAS: ""DON'T KNOW WHT TO TELL YOU""AMAZON IS KINDLY REFUNDING ONE PACKAGE.IN SEARCH OF FRUSTRATION - TRY ATTACHING THESE TO A CAMCO RV SEWER HOSE."
3,"3"" abs RV sewer adapter","Made out of abs but does not have the same diameter of 3"" abs. Had to jury rig it in with a 2 1/2"" rubber coupling. Worked good once we got it installed."
4,Contents vary...,"The contents of this package appear to vary depending upon what the ""most popular"" blades are at that moment. The package I received contained the following: (10)T101B-wood clean cut, (5)T101D-wood fast cut, (5)T118A-metal less than 1/8"", (5)T118B-metal greater than 1/8"", (5)T144D-wood fast cut."
3,Here's what you get....,"No, you don't get the blades shown in the picture. All the blades are, however, Bosch. You get 10 clean-cutting blades for wood/plastic (T101B), 10 fast-cutting blades for wood/plastic (T101D) and 10 rough-cutting blades for wood (T144D). These are quality blades but not stamped with the ""Progressor"" trademark. You be the judge of whether this offer is a value after shipping costs."
5,Excellent blades!,"Each blade type cuts very quickly, yet smoothly. They also stay sharp through many cuts. These are the best jigsaw blades that I have used and are definitely worth the price."
4,Almost Perfect!,"The other reviews have the count of blades correct . . . Tool Crib are you listening . . . put it in the main description!!My only complaint is that these ship in a ziplock back with no padding to protect the blades, they are not carded like the 3, 4 and 5 packs. So, by the time they get to you will have rubbed together enough to have lost a little of their paint, and thus you may have trouble for example telling the T118A from the T118B. I'm also afraid of what this may have done to the blade tips themselves . . but can see no problems."
2,"Good coffee, but falls apart","I received this as a gift for Christmas 2006. We are now coming up on Christmas 2008 and it's completely broken. Through the two years I have had this, I have consistently had problems. I had to buy a new seal, I frequently have to take the seal out for rinsing (which involves a screwdriver), I've had leaks--more like pours. It is very stressful trying to fix an espresso machine for the 15th time when you haven't had any coffee! It is now beyond repair. I believe this time it is the pump (something is broken and the pressurizer can't pressurize).I make one or two espressos a day, so I don't think I'm that hard on a machine. My previous (cheap) machine lasted five years until I gave it away in working condition when I received this one.So--this machine makes good espresso, but it does not hold up over time and is thus not worth the investment. Disappointing! But true."
2,"Cheap in the short run, but doesn't last.","This machine lacks long term value. We're on our third one of these from a local big box retailer. The first two didn't last three months each. Low priced compared to most machines but that price doesn't help now that we're looking to replace it again after only another six months. At this point, the pump doesn't have enough force to push through the espresso when it is ground and packed properly. The frother is adequate once you get the hang of it. The wand never really had enough oomph to froth 20oz of milk in a pitcher. So if you like one shot in a 12oz drink, your pushing the limits of the machine if you make two drinks in the morning. As an alternative we tried the Bialetti Mukka which was also limited by its capacity. The price jump to the next level is significant and so we'll shop carefully before committing for the long term. But we certainly wouldn't go back to this machine."
1,Bad design,"The Krups XP4030 is a major disappointment. While it does make excellent espresso it is not capable of adequately frothing milk. I have been making cappuccino every morning since 1993 and have previously owned several steam powered machines and a pump machine that have all been satisfactory and were capable of excellent frothed milk, this machine isn't up to the task. I returned the first one the day after purchasing it and picked up an identical replacement that was only slightly better. After working with the machine daily for 3 months, it still hasn't produced a single adequate cup of cappuccino."
2,should have listened,"Very disappointed. Like others, got it home, read instructions. Just the cleaning of the machine for the pre-run did not work. the seal from the water reservoir to the machine does not work. Water barely comes through. I fiddled with it for about an hour trying to make one cup, and decided it's just not worth it. I thought for a second I was just a moron (which may be true), but after reading all these similar stories, I am a little disappointed in Krups."
2,Not As Good A Old Krups Expresso Maker,"My old Krups espesso machine finally bit the dust and since I was very happy with this unit thought a Krups replacement was the way to go. The Krups XP4030 is better looking espresso machine than my old one, so I thought it should perform better too. I liked the double espresso shot canister since making espresso for two is always added work. The expresso came out nice, with a creamy head...so far, so good. Unfortunately, when I used the froth steam wand my expectations quickly diminished. It sounded and looked like someone with a straw blowing into milk. It couldn't hold a candle to the old unit in this function, so I returned it the next day. I wonder why Krups have produced a product that in my books is not as good as my old unit and more expensive too."
2,"poor seal design, otherwise good.","had this unit only a year before the seal gave way. Anytime the seal/water got too hot water would hiss and spray everywhere when making espresso. Too bad, for this is an otherwise perfect machine."
2,"Krups XP4030 Pump Espresso Machine, Black","I ordered the Krups Xp4030 Pump Espresso Machine because I had owned a Krups espresso machine in an earlier model. I was basing my purchase on a belief that the new model would be even better than the first one, but NO, it is not. The first machine was made in Switzerland and the current one I purchased was from China. I don't know if it was the materials used to manufacture the latest, but it was not acceptable. There was definitely a smell of plastic from the machine and then when I foamed the milk, there was a smell of plastic and the taste of rubber. My husband called Krups and they sent a new foaming nozzle, but this was not any better. I returned the machine today. I read that some folks think their machine is great, but I did not have this experience. I wanted badly for this to work and used it for about a month, but I just was not enjoying the coffee every morning."
2,"pretty machine, produces a decent shot, but has some serious design issues","with some tinkering, i managed to get a decent shot out of this machine.trouble is, the steam wand is totally useless, the machine leaks like crazy, and it rumbles like a jumbo jet.the gaggia carezza, although tacky looking, is a much better buy in the same price range."
1,KRUP KRAP,"I should have ""listened"" to the bad reviews from several about this product. It immediately failed; then when I got a little coffee to squeeze out, it was no where near even the quality of a boiled cup. Calls to Krups acknowledged the problems, offered to send new designed filter...which two weeks later has not arrived. I bought this believing that Krups was a technology leader in this field. Boy was I wrong."
1,Krups - Great Name - Poor Quality,"I must register two major complaints about this machine. First the steamer is really very poor - the less expensive Krups Espresso Alegro (with abut 4 bars of pressure) works better. And the steam nozzle is of very poor quality. The machine's primary operation is less than adequate, and the filter basket continually clogs, and after ordering 2 replacement baskets, I'm in the market for a higher end espresso machine."
1,Don't Bother,"I was excited to get this machine because I have experienced Krups quality first-hand with their coffee makers, lasting 10+ years. Don't waste your time on this refurb though. It is a lemon.While it worked, it made good espresso, nice crema, reasonably hot (180F+) with proper pre-hearing, but the heater was always very loud and vibrated.After a month of light use, the pressure produced diminished significantly. Now it is a paperweight in my kitchen.The good news is I probably got my money out of it vs buying espressos from the local coffee shopI still like the Krups brand, but this is a clear miss....Back to the attic to recover my Krups steam espresso maker, which still works after 10 years"
1,Short Life,"KRUPS used to be a name synonymous with quality for me, so I purchased this espresso maker two years ago. It just broke this week. I continuously took good care of it, and I used it 4-5 times a week for this duration. This happened within the first year for my KRUPS Drip Coffee machine. Now I am reconsidering the brand or perhaps the quality of the chinese made KRUPS or even that my 250 machine (how much I paid for it two years ago) was not the right model. I will take it for service and let you know how much it'll cost to fix it and see if it'd be worthwhile to buy one or fix it. The problem is that the pressure is gone so water doesn't get through the filter. One more thing that I regret buying the machine is that it has a plastic bottom which has lost its color due to the steam which would be avoidable if I'd purchased all SS one. Anyhow, let see what happens in service!"
3,Room for improvement,"Edit--Originally I thought there was a problem with the switch, due to the pump running between using the froth cycle and back to the center position.However, I've since learned it's normal and is a cool-down cycle.I do have trouble with some pods, where I cannot get water to push through them. I recommend trying a pod sampler pack:PodMerchant Espresso Pod Super Sampler, to find those that work well. Most will be fine; some brands will leak a bit of water into your cup.Making espresso with loose grounds usually leaves wet soupy grounds in the holder, regardless of tamping pressure and cleaning the head, according to the instructions.Overall it makes a good enough espresso.I recommend the Mister Exclusive pods, they're excellent."
3,espresso good but milk is sour,"i bought two of these machines - one for the jobsite trailer, and one for my portuguese workers house. both machines work well at making nice espresso - for a little while. have used both machines now almost 2-3 times a day for multiple shots, for about 5 months. now the filters seem to be blocked and the little pump just can't push it through any more. going to try to decalcify them to see if it works.as to the frother tip - some wizard designed it to be rubber with a stainless sleeve overtop. after several ""uncomfortable"" post-latte experiences, i realized that milk was getting trapped between the rubber and steel sleeve and breeding some lovely green funk bacteria. MAKE SURE YOU WASH THIS WELL!!!an ok machine overall, but i am now going to drop $500+ on a breville machine that looks/reviews/works much better. save your money and spend a little more for something better."
2,"Great looks, major problems","I got this as a wedding present (that I researched and requested) yesterday and returned it today because of some major issues. I'll lead with the positives: this is a solid, good-looking machine with a hefty filter and big water tank. But with that goes noise. When it first starts up it makes a moderate grumble for about 2 seconds. That I can live with. What I can't deal with is the 3 minutes of rumbling and humming while it makes the coffee. The machine shook so much, I literally had to hold the cups in place while it worked. Then after I was done there was a puddle of water on the counter. I read and reread the manual and everything I was doing was by the book. Needless to say I'm disappointed."
1,Horrible Machine NO STARS but that his not a choice,"This is the WORST machine I ever used, and I've had many since the 90's. First it is LOUD, then it takes forever to heat up and steam, but once its got steam it is TOO much steam. The frothing bar is too short too and keeps falling off so keep your free hand on the turn off dial or you could end up in the burn unit. Then the pump...it is on slow motion and does not use all the essence of the espresso grinds. Just floods it. Then you get a nice additional flood on your counter top from all the steam escaping like a 1800's locomotive! If you had more than one person in line for a cappiccino, you'd be in trouble!"
3,Not as good as expected,"When the coffee maker first arrived, it worked great. Just in a month it start to have problem. The water tank doesn't function as it supposed to. I have to apply pressure to make it work. I am thinking about sending it to the repair center."
2,Krups XP4030 Espresso Machine,Ok for a starter machine...purchased on ebay for $70. The frother blows off just about every time I turn on the steam. It takes about 2-3 minutes from pulling shots to frothing. Looking to upgrade now that I know what I like/don't like in these machines.
2,Everything's good except the frother,"This is a great machine except for one flaw. The frother nozzle shoots off during the frothing process. Very messy, very dangerous, and mostly very disappointing. It makes wonderful expresso fast and easy. I use an expresso jigger and it stays fairly hot on the plate above (which it is intended for) while doing the next step of frothing the milk. The frother nozzle is the only issue I have with this machine. I now keep it on using one of those ring clamps I bought in the car parts and accessories department. I got one with a little handle on it. I still have to be careful as it still will occasionally shoot off. I have written Krups by email with NO ANSWER and that is very discouraging. I am looking at buying a different brand now, too bad because this was otherwise a great machine for the price."
2,nothing but problems,I have had this machine for several years the first problems was the foul smelling plastic that wasused for the water container Krups sent me a new one but it is still the same problem Now it has up andquit the pump no longer pumps it makes noises but nothing I called the toll free number with thoughtsof taking it to a service center in Illinois but the canned messages says sorry we have closed the Illinoisservice center This machine is not worth dealing with any more Krups name is in the dumpster for mefine german craftsmanship is now made in China
2,Nice and noisy for a year,The coffee this machine makes is actually pretty good. Only lasted a year and was noisy as hell when used. It vibrated so bad that even when new I had to watch the carafe to make sure it didn't fall off the machine. All and all if it lasted it would be worth 4 stars but alas less than a year of use is unacceptable.
2,No Froth!,"The machine was user-friendly but has two major drawbacks: 1. There is no auto stop, so you need to turn it off when you have the quanity of coffee you want. Secondly, and this is the worst, there is no froth, only bubbles. We called the company about this and were told to only insert the tip into the milk. However, this brought the same measley bubbles that we got when we put the wand deeper into the milk. This will be going back."
2,Not Recommended,"This product has two fundamental problems. One is a strong plastic-ey aroma from the water reservoir that doesn't go away with time. The other more fundamental problem is that it is extremely sensitive to the grind - a little bit too fine and it gets totally constipated and won't funtion. If you do get any coffee out of it it is burned and foul tasting. I consider it a waste of money and am looking for a replacement. On the plus side, if the grind is just right it will produce good espresso."
2,Watch out for hot milk!!!!!!!,My wife bought me this since I wanted one for a while. At first the machine worked very nice but then came the wand flying off in the middle of steaming the milk. What a mess and I was actaully burned by the milk although it didn't leave a mark. The cost was very good considering the quality of the espresso drinks I made. Easy to use and the instructions were fairly clear. I can see a law suit coming if they don't change the frothing wand design. Very bad idea.
2,Dissapointing,"Have had several Krups espresso maker. All have been wonderful low end machines. decided to upgrade.Even though the machine makes great espresso, the steaming mechanism is a very poor design. Instead of a screw on frothing mechanism, Krups has incorporated a friction fit design to facilitate cleaning. I cannot tell you how many times the mechanism has popped out into my mug spraying milk eveywhere. Throwing it out today."
2,Faulty Workmanship,"I've had 3 of these: in less than 30 days!!! It makes great espressos and caps, but mine kept breaking, and the retailer confided that ours weren't the only ones. The first one wouldn't steam. The second one did, but then the 'wand' literally shot off the machine into the milk, and could have steamed my hand. The third one had a funky switch right out of the box: it was angled like it hadn't been attached correctly at the factory. We kept it for 10 days, and then it died completely.To their credit, customer service was excellent, empathetic, and did the right thing. But I'm done with Krups. Too bad, because the expresso and the steamer worked perfectly (when they worked)."
3,crops and methods fro soil improvement,this book tells of the basics with covercrop and rotation. it is a good book for the beginner or for information for writing a short paper for te middle schooler
2,"Buy the electronic version, not the hardcopy book","I returned the book promptly upon receipt. It appears they used a poorly formatted .pdf file, enlarged the font size to 16, and then hit print on a 450+ page paperback. I cannot speak for the information in the book, as I could only tolerate the first few pages before the formatting got the best of me."
4,"A worthy addition to the ""Historical Arthur"" genre.","Being a first-time author, Rice has wisely (I think) avoided trying to give another retelling of the whole Arthurian saga. Instead, he has written a tale set some ten years after Arthur's death, in which the main characters are Bedwyr, Guinevere and Medraut's son (Arthur's grandson) Irion. He tells how the warring Britons manage to hold off the Saxons for a little longer, and also gives the origin for the myth that Arthur is sleeping until needed by his people again. I found the climax both exciting and moving. There are a few historical howlers, but on the whole the times are created quite well, especially with Justinian's reconquest of Italy being brought to the fore at the beginning of the book. Its not the best book I've ever read, but if you collect good historical (not fantasy) novels about the Arthurian period then add this one to your collection."
1,States as sinking but doesn't sink like the 1mm,Floats. Makes feeding very hard have to pre soak in a dish and then dump into tank or it floats through the overflow. It's a shame.
2,Not Much Flavor,I've never used syrups before and I'm disappointed. It adds sweetness but hardly any flavor. I think the flavored coffees are much better.
2,So So,Okay if you want to learn 3d the fast way in director then this isn't the book for you. The book does in some ways go into detail but then again he also side tracks so this book is not for the new comers. Your suppose to know a few things in director already and also in the lingo area. The whole thing in this book is the lingo part. Its code heavy so you as the reader is suppose to have some sort of back ground in director in order to understand it. Over all its an okay book but not the best.
4,Never really got into it,"I am a technical manual geek... I have ten times more tech manuals than any other type of book.This one, I never really got into. I know programming, but this seemed a bit out of line for what I was looking for.Though you might find it helpful, I didn't. (Still a good fundamentals book though)"
2,Poorly written,"On the outside, this book looks excellent for those wanting to create 3d games in director. On the inside, the book is shallow and un-engaging. Most concepts are covered poorly and are made hard to understand. One of my biggest gripes about this book is how the author tells you ""Now lets learn how to make _____"", and instead of explaining things, just dumps 4 pages of lingo code on you. I feel that a good book should break down the code and explain what it is doing. Copying a hundred lines of code form a book does not teach you anything. The book is also very dry and a bore to read. I fell asleep several times while reading, no joke.If you want a book that touches on some of the same principles, take a look at ""shockwave 3d"" by Jason Wolf. This book was excellent, explained concepts with sufficient detail, and will give you that ""That is exactly what i wanted to do, lets do it!"" feeling."
2,Not worth it,This is not a book to use if you are trying to learn Director and Lingo. It is more about game design in general with some Director 3D thrown in for good measure. The game he develops is by no means state of the art and doesn't even show the capabilities of the Shockwave engine. I wouldn't recommend buying this book unless you have read everything else on GAME DEVELOPMENT and just want one more lame opinion on it. Do not buy it if you are trying to learn Director for your 3D projects. There are much better books for it.
3,Scandalous?,"'Age of Scandal' details the sort of scandal and gossip that abounded during the 18th century. The king, his ministers and the ""upper classes"" were all subjected to the scandalmongers of the time, and White enjoys reporting on both the mongers and on their subjects.T.H. White is a great writer, with an light manner that made this book relatively easy to read, despite its depth of detail. I believe however that it is somewhat dated. In comparison to today's media-oriented world where scandal has to be really BAD before we consider it ""juicy"" much of the ""scandal"" was just good fun. On the other hand, it was fascinating to learn about what was considered scandalous in England in the 18th century."
2,A failed experiment,"Heresy in the RT world...I do not like this and rarely play it. Lots of smart people like it, but I think they like its sentiment more than its music.Richard Thompson is in my CD player almost all the time. His best songs, and there are many many many of them, evoke emotion, thought, passion, hope, and despair. This is just a glum, and somewhat anachronistic, look at the mechanized world.I too wish the world were different. But Richard, I've seen you in concert many times, and you don't play stuff from this one very often. I suspect there's a reason."
4,Some Classics and some Christmas rarities!,"Another review led me to try this CD out. I am glad I did. The sound is crisp and clear with some classic dated oldies, VERY Connie Francis, South American, and European 1960 styles!! In Dalidas deep beautiful voice you have ""Save the last dance for me"", the Brazilian rhythms of ""S'endormir comme d'habitude"", the Greek and Italian rhythms of ""Les enfants du piree"", ""C'est un jour 'a Naples"" & ""O sole mio"", plus ""Itsy Bitsy teenie weenie bikini"". But the price of the CD alone is worth hearing her sing ""Silent night"", ""White Xmas"" and ""Jingle Bells"". (In french of course but sung in the standard way and absolutely beautiful!)"
3,In Search of the Black Rose,"Carolyn Keen's books are very well-done mysteries for younger audiences, but as you get older they get a little dull. Still, Carolyn Keen is very good at composing mysteries; she balances out the mystery well with good pacing, multiple threads that tie in together, and interesting concepts. I guess even as you get older, you can learn a few bits of trivia from the Nancy Drew series. The characterizations, however, are fairly stereotypical. (In other words, don't read this series for character development.)Aside from somewhat boring new characters, this is one of the better Nancy Drew mysteries. The pacing is well done, the setting is fun, and there's an element of danger when things for Nancy actually get a little rough."
3,"It's ok, but not great.","This album isn't as good asMore Latin Club Mix 2000. Most of the songs on this album are either cover versions of other songs (Copa de la Vida - Ricky y Su Banda & Oye - Miami Rumba) or songs that I wouldn't really consider ""club mix"" material. There are only a few good songs. (Baila [Bilingual Version] - Ilegales, Rumba [12"" Dance Mix] - D'Mingo, Latinos [Hex Hector Mix] - Proyecto Uno, Mueve Mueve [Move It Move It] - Sandy y Papo & I Still Believe [Steve Chavez Mix] - Brenda K. Starr) If you're expecting a full album of Latin House, then this isn't the album for you."
2,not that you have a choice,"If you are buying this book, you probably have to because it is assigned reading. This was a very frustrating read. It was both preachy and repetitious. There was one model that he repeatedly used for every role of the macro social worker. After 3-4 times of this, I was asking myself, ""didn't I read this before?"" after 6-7 times I was ready to pull my hair out. By the time the course was over, even our instructor was telling us to skim the chapters, that we'd read this before.I typically keep all of my textbooks, but I am definitely selling this book. It was a complete waste of time."
1,One of the worst,"As another reviewer said, not that you generally have a choice in buying this.....but try to avoid it. It's patronizing, preachy, and all around painful. Get the reserve copy at your library and peruse the few paragraphs that might be useful for your assignment and then save yourself the pain of reading the rest."
3,Good mystery,"This short novel is an easy read for elementary students. The plot is formulaic, which makes it easier for younger readers to comprehend. It follows a basic mystery plot that Cam solves in the end."
5,Go with a tested product,"This is my 4th pair of the Belleville 390s. The ones that this pair replaced were well-used. I wore them through Ranger School, SFAS, RSLC, and other tactical courses before they finally broke beyond repair. Ordering direct through Amazon, my boots arrived promptly and in good shape."
3,"Good, but need breaking in","These boots will require some form of breaking in, unlike my previous pair of Belleville (different model) that were comfortable out of the box. This pair caused my feet to hurt the first week or so. I had to really loosen up the laces to keep the pain from being unbearable. The boots themselves are fine once broken in."
3,long shipping time,I ordered these boots because I needed them for training at Camp Shelby but I didn't receive them for over a month. Not happy at all.
5,Offshore profits - invisible and tax free,"This unique book is an extremely valuable, up to date guide to the best information ever published on offshore investments, mutual funds, asset protection, privacy tactics, tax-havens, tax mitigation and much more."
1,high cost-zero benefit,"... This is just like all the other books onlymore expensive. The author ... is heavy on the stories, paranoia, andadvantages for investing offshore, but there are no details on HOW todo it. What we could all use is a list of countries stating theiradvantages, and then a comprehensive list of reputable banks in eachcountry with contact information for each. All the rest is just abunch of filler ... with no useful purpose. Save your money. ......"
5,Great looking Vacuum!,"The product not only looks great, but it works great too! It looks great while it is charging."
4,Incognito handheld vacuum..,"This handheld vacuum is great. It does its purpose and looks nice. I bought it to pick up pet hair from my laminate floor and it does a great job at that. The suction is pretty strong. It is a little loud though.. but I guess vacuums are. The base of the white one lights up. I personally would prefer if it didn't light up.. but whatevers. no biggie. HOwever, the other colors don't light up. The handheld is a little heavy, but it's not too bad. Overall, I would recommend it to others."
1,Good design- terrible function.,"I am a designer and was really taken by the simple elegant design of this vacuum cleaner... its nicely made and looks good lying around the house. But when it comes to function, its fails completely... pretty much all the dust i have tried to pick up with this vacuum cleaner stayed put and its also extremely noisy. If it was not so cheap I would have returned it....."
2,Not a useful vaccum cleaner for picking up hairs,I bought this vacuum cleaner to pick up hairs on the carpet and bathroom floor. It does not do the jobunfortunately. It is a very weak vacuum cleaner. Masking tape works better.
3,NK,"this product looks good and is powerful enough, but the ""mouth"" is very narrow, so it takes repeated sweeping motions to cover a given area. Another disadvantage is that it is often a trial and error process to place it back in its stand. Buy it if you prefer form over function."
4,"Not that impressed, but decent product","This vacuum is very stylish and appeals to the eye however, it is not extremely powerful even when fully charged. It does get the job done but takes longer because of the lack of power. I use it several times a week to vacuum out my car and it gets the job done."
4,Kool vac,This hand vac looks good and actually works quite well. I charge it and then unplug it. It stays charged for several days. I disliked all the other vacs I had because they were ugly and did not pick up well. They were just handy. This one looks sleek in the new kitchen. I just might buy another for the upstairs!
5,A Splendid brief Physiography of the US,"This book is for those who want the general picture without too much detail and jargon. Part I gives the general reader the needed brief background in geology, climate, and vegetation. Part II gives brief but adequate descriptions of the natural or physiographic regions of the US and includes sites of interest."
5,Stop-Motion Live-Action,"A bizarre and engrossing mix of stop-motion live actors and claymation is used in this reworking of the old Tom Thumb story. This new Tom is created utilizing genetically engineered baby goo, and his clay self is born to normal but inept parents. Ominous men in black lurk in the grimy shadows, waiting to snatch young Tom, but the boy manages to find his way back to the lab where the mystery of his origins, and others like him, await."
1,Not enough insulating shielding,"I already had a cord long enough for my purposes which I got for about three dollars online, but whenever I tried to run the cord alongside my video cord in a rubber cord concealer on the floor, we would get bad sound interference. I thought this cord would solve the problem but the sound interference is actually worse and this was a waste of money for me. In my opinion there are much cheaper cords out there of the same length and of the same quality or better. I suppose I could now try a video cord with more shielding, but I think I am at the point I will simply give up on tidy cord appearance and run one of the cords by itself under a mat, rather than keep trying better cords."
5,Replacement John Deere mower belt,"I was worried that this belt was not a ""genuine"" John Deere belt. I installed the belt and it worked perfectly at one third the price of buying this belt from a local John Deere dealer."
1,What am I going to do with 1 shock?,"misleading product photo, shows a pair,but you only get one. I am sure they are great shocks once I order another ."
5,"Small, but packed, well written. Defines and defends.","The book is small, but the illustrations still are reproduced extremely well. The essay alone is worth every penny. If you feel uneasy about your love for the work of Norman Rockwell, this book will give you the courage to like what you really like, without any more appologies. Buy it, read it, enjoy. You will, I guarantee."
5,CDs better,"I had the vinyl album, but the CD is better. There's at least one new song. The sound quality is every bit as good."
3,Okay beginners book,This book is good for beginning wood turners.Lots of photos and a few projects that a beginner or intermediate would accomplish.
3,Not Quite,"If you are going to start reading diskworld novels, please do not start with this one.It's not that good. It feels like a 'quota book', as if a book publisher said ""Hey Terry, you promised us a book this year..."". It probably was nothing like that, but it seems like the author took characters from previous books, renamed them and stirred and then didn't sharpen his satire and wit on a proper whetstone.The topic is dying for good satire, but this didn't strike a cord with me. I still laughed at a lot of things and heck, I'll take a Pratchett book any day over just about any other novel. However, I have re read most of Terry's books over the years, but I have never picked this one up again.Start with the gaurds series, the witches series or the rincewind series - any of those will give you a good laugh and a good push into diskworld!"
5,Rincewind's best role.,They say making a movie is hell. They say being a movie star is heaven. Pratchett lets Rincewind bridge the gap. A spot on satire of the beginning of an industry.
3,"Mediocre Discworld book, cinema is a hard topic to write about","I've read all the Discworld novels up until this one, and this was one of the worst of the bunch. I think the problem with this book is that there's not enough things you can make funny about film. The end parts of the books are the best, with some funny mock scenes, but that doesn't make the whole book worth it. I usually am laughing many times in a Discworld novel, but this one did not do that for me."
3,Read this without stopping then jump into bed.,"I have read lots of Pratchetts and the formula's beginning to wear thin. I don't laugh out loud like I used to. I will confess though that the book does have one scene that keeps tangoing in my iimagination --- that of a giant woman climbing up a tower with a screaming ape... if you want to introduce yourself to Pratchett, read Soul Music or anything with the character Rincewind instead."
4,A European satire on Hollywood,"I deeply enjoyed Pratchett's way of stabbing at and making fun of America's No. 1 dream factory. Nice one, T.P.!!"
1,Amazon is selling defective copies of this book - BEWARE,"This is a great book, HOWEVER, the brand new copy I received from Amazon is missing some 36 pages right before the end, at the books climax. This is a publishing error, not pages that have been removed. Talk about a ruined reading experience, and, quite naturally, since I ordered several Discworld books at once, by the time I discovered this Amazon REFUSES to replace it (with what would almost certainly be just another identical copy). Guess I have to buy this one again - at a physical bookstore."
2,"Not another talking dog joke, please!",It has some funny moments but it's certainly not Pratchett's best. As crazy and sometimes corrupt Hollywood is it's not the sort of industry where Cthulu would be comfortable. The combination just doesn't make sense. And then there's the talking dog. On about every fifth page Pratchett stops the plot (what little of one there is) to do yet another talking dog joke!
5,Read it!,This is only the second discworld book I've read but I'm already hooked on the series. As opposed to the parodies in Colour of Magic(None of which I got) you'll instantly recognise movies like King Kong and Gone With The Wind(Blown Away). The book isn't exactly based as much on plot(But it's good enough) as it is on hilarity. Some great characters. I especially liked the animals. Could anyone tell me what other books Gaspode is in?
2,Contrived,"Too contrived, too many riffs on existing motion pictures and not enough good one-liners and story events compared to prior books. Sure, ha ha ha, one more joke referencing existing motion pictures and how they work, but it got boring after a while until the main story needed some action to finish the book."
4,For Movie Lovers Everywhere,"One of the funniest books i have ever read! when i first started reading Terry Pratchett's Discworld Series i couldn't believe i had gone through my life without knowing his books were out there. i am an ultimate film fan and i cracked up at all the references. this was to movie fans what Soul Music was to music lovers. Discworld is for everyone who loves mystery, adventure, and above all, a good laugh."
3,The Funny Movie Industry,"I admit that I am not a big fan of the motion picture industry, so maybe that prejudiced my opinion. The book is OK: it does have its strong points. CMOT Dibbler is always funny (and so are his relatives). In fact, the conversations between Dibbler and his nephew? are very funny. But I still think he is funniest as a seller of sausages and meat pies in Ankh-Morpork. And it is funny to watch others try to eat them. The parodying of Hollywood was very funny, especially the ""gold warrior"" whose job it is to uphold quality in movies. It is worth it mainly to try to catch all the punnish references to Hollywood and to hear the Dibblers arguing all the time - and the 1000 elephants add to it, too. OK, but OK for Pratchett is good for other authors."
5,"Play it Agian, Sham","One word: Hillarious. I read this book after readig about Gaspode's other antics with Angua and such, and this tied up a lot of loose ends about him. this is one of Pratchett's better books not belonging to any of the discworld mini series. CMOT, as usual was great (even though why he called himself ""throat"" in this book is beyond me), and the wizards, as usual, were one of the most entertaining parts of the book."
3,"Good, but not perfect","Beautiful photos. Great Ideas. Lots of instructions. What's not to like? Well, there isn't a mention of portion size or number anywhere to be found. I figured out that the larger cakes serve 150 wedding portions by finding one that is made of 150 molds filled with chocolate mousse. If you don't really know how to work with cakes and their decorations this book is a bit advanced- I'm a pastry chef and had problems with the first one I tried. It was worth the effort- a tasty cake and wonderful to behold. I'm going to try another of the cakes in a few weeks-and now I know how much time it might really take. YOU MUST PLAN AHEAD when using this book-like a week in advance. Otherwise- go for it, you'll definitely learn a lot"
3,Not a Great book for wedding cakes. This book is for a very advance kind of wedding cake maker. Too complex for me,The book was too complex . This book is for a very advance wedding cake maker .I wish i did not buy this book.The cakes were for a very advance cake maker.
3,Great service.,"This is the third time I am writing. I had all kinds of problems running this program. But the email response was quick and solved the problems. The program is working well. I mention that I tried it on my backup computer and that I couldn't get it to work there either. Even though you are suppose to install it on only one computer, they helped me get it running on that one also. They responed in less than 24 hours."
1,Crashed my computer,"I'm a software consultant so I run brand-name software on an IBM Thinkpad computer with Windows2000 and a vanilla but loaded system.Bad News: Completely hosed my system when it went to make the CD. After that, no files came up in Add/Remove programs. Internet was suddenly read/only. Had to reformat my hard drive / replace my OS. After doing that, we put in CD to restore data and it crashed my system completely. So we had to reformat again. Luckily I had everything backed up by hand on an external hard disk (the point of buying this software in the first place). While it is obviously my configuration or they would be out of business, what a nightmare!Good News: I had no interest in tech support, just getting my money back. Rarely have I had such a customer-friendly experience of getting a refund."
1,...,"... The product worked, but it is under documented, written in broken english and makes false promises.YOU MUST HAVE UDF PACKET WRITING SOFTWARE INSTALLED IN YOUR SYSTEM. This means that unless you want to pay Extra for Roxios Easy cd/dvd Creator or Nero with InCd this product is useless if you want to burn a disc for back up..."
5,Nice listening for a relaxed mood,Break out the wine and relax in front of a nice fire while Rod takes you away. Reason To Believe is beautiful song that anyone who has loved can relate to. You Wear It Well follows that same vein of hurt in love that stikes a chord within us all.
5,It has everything I needed,"what else can I say but what a great shave! This Body Bare shaver shaved me so smooth without burning me. The Package I got came with everything i need including oil to keep my shaver working to its potential. In my opinion, this is well worth the money.M.M."
1,Are you kidding,"This book was published in 1980, and then again in 2001 but not updated. All material is at least 23 years old."
4,interesting architectural interview,as an architect i have seen quite a few of Charlie Roses' interviews of architects. They are typically good. Of course if you had a way to track the reruns you could probably watch this for free. But if you don't then this is worth the cost.
2,Product delivered is NOT what is pictured,"The sponges I received are standard triangular shaped wedges, not rounded, half-heart shaped ones as pictured here. There's nothing wrong with them, but these are not what I wanted."
5,soundtrack for a happy life,"I have been in love with Chaka Khan's infectious cheerful spirit since, oh, what, 1975? This CD really shows why. Hearing ""Tell Me Something Good"" & ""Ain't Nobody"" take me to a place where I know that certain guy is going to fall in love with me & I'm enjoying the trip getting there. (There's a lot to be said for anticipation.) When I first heard Whitney Houston sing ""I'm Every Woman,"" I enjoyed her vocal acrobatics. Then I heard CHAKA sing it & I was hoping she WAS every woman because I'd be proud to be her. But she's not, of course. She's a goddess! Get this & get happier right away!"
5,Great album,This album is a compilation of some of the best songs of Ms. Chaka Khan. It is very soothing and highlights the best attributes of this artist.
4,Chaka Khan - what a voice !,"I love Chaka Khan - her album I Feel For You is one of my alltime faves. I remember listening to it in school and thinking how amazing her booming powerful voice was & wishing I was old enough to go clubbing... This is a good compilation of her best of, although many of my faves are missing. I love I Feel For You & Ain't Nobody - both classics. I wish This Is My Night, Destiny, Love of a Lifetime, Can't Stop the Streets (from Krush Groove) & Own the Night (Miami Vice) were on it... Maybe someday! anyway, this is a great collection to get to know Chaka's material from the 70s through early 90s. 5 stars for Chaka, 4 stars for the missing tracks"
1,They never delivered.,I waited and waited and finally received an email that I wouldn't be receiving my CD. It was a birthday gift and I had to scramble.
1,Mediocre and Unimaginative,Very boring. Bland new age techno without any redeeming qualities. An appropriate place for this to be played would be in an elevator or perhaps convalescence home.
5,"Worlds Apart sets them ""apart""","Just as ""Art is in the Eyes of the Beholder"", ""Music is in the Ears of the BeListener"" --I listen to this CD in a Sony Stereo with Sony Headsets (not just earphones) and turn up the volume,and you can hear so much more, and the R/L.I purchased this CD after buying their other CD ""Breathe"" and liking it so much,I bought ""Worlds Apart"". The CD case is actually the hard plasticcase of most CD's, unlike Breathe which was cardboard. There is a glossy16 page insert with info on BlueStone, credits, thanks, and lyrics.16 tracks on this CD, and alot more vocals & lyrics as compared to Breathe.Angelic voices, synthesizers, electronic percussion, and various beats, I'm in my music heaven.ALSO recommend: their other CD Breathe and Mysteria - Tempting the Muse"
5,"Taken to a world I only dreamed of, until now!","A simply wonderful CD! Definitely one of my favorites of all time. All of the songs are great and the vocals are heavenly! I can't wait for their next CD!! If you like this CD, you might be interested in Balligomingo - beneath the surface."
3,research,"came on time, great gift idea, loved the product, wonderful service, nice to have around when you need good read"
1,not intuitive enough,"Just a quick browse through, I find that the materials are not intuitiveenough. I tried to look for the explanation for Figure 6.21, but did notfind clear explanation. Some of the deeper stuff probably can begenerated by readers once the basic stuff is discussed in detail andintuitively. In general, for someone with an excellent math backgroundtries to go into the pattern recongnition field, this is NOT the book."
2,Trust not the fortitude,This is a single piece of thin cording that uses a small plastic clip/gear to loop and lock the sizing in place. I concede that this harness will fit cats of many sizes and ages (kitten to full grown). There is little doubt in my mind that this would not hold my 12 lb kitty if startled; thus defeating the purpose of the harness. I will give this to someone with a kitten or small rabbit. :{
3,Almost too small for our cat!,"Our cat is 17 lbs so it seemed as though she would shrug out of it. Hard to put on a big cat, due to size and him not holding still. Better for small cats! But did its job while we were moving!"
1,Beware of strangulation!,"Any figure 8 harness is dangerous!I was trying one of these on my cat, so she could get used to it before we had to go anywhere using it.She immediately got her back leg caught in the chest strap, while scratching at it and trying to get it off. This tightened the noose around her neck dangerously tight! The more she struggled to get her leg free, the more she choked herself!Thankfully, I stayed in the room after putting the harness on her, to watch her. I was able to free her within a minute of her entanglement, but she was traumatized by the whole experience and I feel lucky that she was not injured.If you think about it, any harness of this design is a potential strangle noose. No matter how much slack you leave around the cat's neck, if the chest strap gets caught on anything, the neck strap will tighten."
3,cat harness,"I like the cat lead and harness o.k..It would be nice if the lead was longer though. My cat didn't care for it much. It was only the first time she tried something like that though. She didn't get away though, like it said. She just wanted to go under the porch or get back in the house. It is a good inexpencive product."
1,tippy was choking because of badly designed harness lock,"I left tippy in my yard for a few minutes; when I checked on him; harness tightened around his neck and was chocking him badly, he was freaking out! badly designed lock ...keep away from this one! I was lucky i saw him in time!"
1,Wake me up when you've got something interesting to say...,"I can't believe this book is so rubbish, I roar. I'm giving my friend Fiona a guided tour of my book shelf. I've recommended Carl Sagan's `Cosmos' and `Heavier than Heaven,' Charles Crosses' excellent Kurt Cobain bio. Now I've come to this rock novel, complete with a cover quote from Alex James of Blur. I've got quarter of the way through Fiona, and honestly... it's all panties and cocaine. All the women are either posh totty with visible panty lines or they're putting on floor shows with their own mothers! Do men buy this stuff or are they completely stupid? Emerald, says Fiona, who do you think this book is aimed at? But Fiona, like Joan Jett I love Rock and Roll, and this is a rock and roll book. Look at all the AC/DC books on my shelves. What, the ones next to `Modern Man in Search of a Soul' and `A History of Britain,' Fiona asks.We're both laughing now."
2,Not for the young and vibrant,"I did not enjoy reading about middle-aged men in the midst of a crisis. That is what most of the stories are about. I did not connect or relate to any of the characters. I was happy that the stories were short because I could not stand an entire novel of such depressing and predictable content. Yes, this book was well written, however, if that is a large portion of justifying this book as excellent then I would advise exploring other kinds of books;there are plenty of books that are both interesting and well written. I would mostly recommend this book for men and even then, middle-aged men. I think this is a better audience for the author's style of writing."
2,Not his best,"This Russo collection of short stories didn't really work for me. I love his books like Straight Man and Nobody's Fool but I just couldn't get into this outing from him. It could very well not be Russo's fault, I tend to have issues with short stories in general."
4,The man can write!,I am beginning to think Russo could write about a trip to the supermarket and make it entertaining. I love this guy's writing and I am so bias I am should not be trusted. Do yourself a favor and buy all of his books. You can get them cheap right here and you won't regret it. Now my favorite author of all time.
5,Whets your appetite for Russo's next great novel,"I&#65533;m hoping Russo&#65533;s just warming up for a big, fat novel with this wonderful collection of stories. Because reading The Whore&#65533;s Child makes you want MORE. All of these stories are written with Russo&#65533;s subtle combination of humor and pathos, which imbues them with a nostalgic, bittersweet feel. Like much of his fiction, most of the stories in this book take place in small towns with small-town (but not small-minded) characters as the central focus. From the nun who tries her hand at writing a memoir of her lonely life to the mother and son who take a harrowing cross-country journey, each story pulls you in and leaves you anxiously awaiting another novel as great as Empire Falls."
2,"Nice glove, but wear out quickly","These gloves are lightweight and effective. But after light to moderate use, the foam disintegrates where the knuckles meet the bag. I hit the bag several times per month, for about 5-10 minutes a session, and these things wore out before the year was up. I would invest in a better pair of gloves."
3,Not the best but gets the job done,I've had these gloves for about 3 years and they're very nice and comfortable. I used them quite a lot at first but decided to upgrade to better gloves. You just slip your hands in no wrist straps or anything so it's easy to put on and take off. The padding is ok and there's a hole in the palm area of the glove for extra breathing room. My biggest complaint about these gloves are that the wrist moves easily when you punch the bag since they're a little loose since there are no wrist straps to support the wrist. If you hit the bag enough times it shouldn't be a problem though because your wrists should be able to take the impact. These get the job done but if you hit the bag everyday for more than 30-45 mins then I suggest upgrading to something better. I can stand these gloves for 20 minutes or so but you eventually get stronger the more you punch the bag.
4,Need to specify Mens OR Women's~,"Very confused because when I ordered these gloves, it just said Large. Did't say Men's on it anywhere. Now I received them and the box says Men's L/XL - which are obviously too big. I certainly don't want to spend the money to ship these back when I feel the description was misleading."
4,Nice themed serving bowl,"Well made and looks nice. Personally, I likedProgressive International Salsa Bowlbetter (and it's cheaper, too). But this adds nice variety and has a spreader rather than a spoon for more spreadable food. And though it's a touch more expensive than the product I linked to, it is still very reasonably priced."
5,Exactly what I was looking for.,"This hard-to-find mini eraser was exactly what I was looking for and needed. I am a transcriptionist and recently purchased a new machine to play tapes but it did not have an erase function like my last machine did. I found this mini eraser and it does the job perfectly. It's quick and easy. Although it was a little pricier than I had expected, this particular one was the least expensive of all the ones I found on the Internet."
1,Missed the boat with this one!,"While the TiVo service is amazing they really missed the boat with this product.The idea behind this unit is to be able to record two shows at one time; a really great idea that has been available in cable and dish systems for some years. However, this unit really can't do that for many people.You can ONLY record two shows if you meet ALL of the following conditions:-You subscribe to cable TV-At least one show you want to record is on analouge (not digital) cable-The other show you want to record is on either digital or analouge cableIf you have an antenna, no dice. Dish newtwork or DirectTV, no dice. Want to record a show on HBO and Showtime at the same time, no dice. Basically, you can never really know if the shows you want to record can be recorded or not without having to cross reference them to what part of your cable service they are on.TiVo has the right idea but clearly did not execute it with this product."
3,What is the TIVO service,"This might not be the best way to approach a question but I'm confused. What exactly is the ""TIVO service""? Is this monthly service required just to record TV shows on my Charter service? Don't have HBO or a dish. Just want to shift watching shows to a later time. Thanks."
2,Very disappointing,"I had my previous Tivo box for 5 years and I was very happy with it. This particular machine promises that its dual tuner technology will allow you to capture two channels at once. An exciting promise, but it doesn't deliver. Getting a blank screen on one of the channels is the most common problem Tivo owners have - check any Tivo bulletin board. The worst part is that the two channels will be working fine and then you discover that it hasn't recorded programs because of the dual tuner.In addition, I've had far more trouble connecting to the Tivo service through this box than I ever had with the previous box.I've disconnected my cable splitter. I'm just going to use it as a single tuner box. I hope the connection problems don't continue.I miss my old Tivo.Update - March 2009It works fine as a single-tuner Tivo. I haven't tried the double tuner since I bought it."
4,A good read,"This is an excellent book for someone looking to get into the Borzoi showing commuinity. Not for someone who just wants a pet Borzoi or for someone who already knows a lot about Borzoi (unless you want to do a bit of english pedigree research). I'm just getting into showing Borzoi and I found the book very informitive.This book goes into a fair ammount of detail on conformation, bloodlines, breeding, showing, and genetics. I did happen to find the photo-manipulated pictures a bit of an annoyance though.""The Complete Borzoi"" by Lorraine Groshans (a fairly difficult book to find) and any of the BCOA publications are much better than this book. But, it's worth reading."
1,Drivel,I was amazed at the lack of knowledge expressed by the writer of this book. Down to things like according to the book a borzoi has hare feet at the front and cat feet at the back.......only if your dog is walking backwards would that be true! I'm surprised this got published.
1,"Thin, outdated, and pretty much useless","As an artist for 30 years and a teacher for over 20, I can't figure out how anyone could actually find this book useful. First of all, this is an ART book with NO illustrations --- so you need to know something else before you read the entries. I must admit that I haven't read the whole book, but none of the dozen or so entries I saw gave useful information. For example, notes on Frank Stella, Rauschenberg, Jasper Johns, Robert Morris, Bruce Nauman, were mainly short descriptions of single works, or periods of work, from 25-40 years ago. The shallow entries seem to be quick, random, fact and quote gathering. The writer seems to have much more interest in what might be called traditional art as the entries seem longer --- for example the entry on Puvis de Chavannes is longer than that for Rauschenberg. What this book is for is beyond me. This may not be the fault of the writer, but it is a fault of the whole concept. Can't be done in 730 pages."
2,still in the dark on Dutch poetry,"i bought this book to read en route to the Netherlands. As a writer of poetry myself, I like to get a feel for the local poetry of places I visit. The dutch are apeople who have made great contributions to Western society--but in the realm of Dutch language literature, they (wrongly) assume that only they are interested in it.Unfortunately, this book does not present me with a clear view of Dutch poetry. Why? The translations are hideous! They are written for the most part in a convoluted, artifiical English which was obviously composed with too much closeness to the original text and not enough feel for the natural flows of English. The translations are artificual-sounding, with lines composed in an unnatural way so that they ""will rhyme."" So on the quality scale, these translations are the equivalent of paint-by-number. I can't believe that Dutch poetry can be this bad."
4,A great compilation...but!,"Capitol is finally giving Linda some attention her catalog has needed for so many years. This is a great compilation, but where is ""(She's A) Very Lovely Woman""? I remember it getting airplay when it came out. I bought the 45. So, what's the deal with this song being so damn obscure?"
5,An unmatched voice,Linda Ronstadt remains one of the all-time best for power and emotion. Love the clarity found in the remastered version.
2,poorly remastered,"i bought this primarily for heart like a wheel, this is my second attempt at getting a remastered copy of this album. i've purchased all of the mobile fidelity pressings of her other recordings which are amazing. this, like the other copy, is an import. it seems as though the person responsable for the remastering never actually listened to the final product. her vocals at times sound distorted, the bottom is flat and the highs are to high. this is the case on both cds so i don't think its defective, its just a bad remastering job. heart like a wheel is a great recording that just needs to be done correctly. this isn't it."
5,COUNTRY ROCK QUEEN AT HER BEST!!!!!,"JUST RECEIVED THIS COLLECTION AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FROM A FRIEND. TO SAY I'M A HUGE FAN OF LINDA'S WOULD BE A MINIMIZATION. CAPITOL'S REMASTERING OF 4 ALBUMS PLUS BONUS TRACKS OF THE GREATEST AMERICAN VOICE EVER IS INCREDIBLE. YOU CAN HEAR EVERY NUANCE OF THIS SUPERSTAR'S PHENOMENAL VOICE AND RANGE. THE GRAPHICS AND PACKAGING ARE GREAT ALSO WITH SOME GREAT PICS OF LINDA. LONG LONG TIME LIVE IS AN EXTREMELY EMOTIONAL READING OF WHAT ESQUIRE MAGAZINE HAS CALLED THE ""ULTIMATE HEARTBREAK SONG."" A MUST HAVE FOR LINDA FANS AND LOVERS OF QUALITY MUSIC!!!! 46 INCREDIBLE SONGS FOR A GREAT PRICE. THANKS AMAZON!!! MOST HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! EDDIEJINNJ"
4,Less than satisfactory remastering sound,"I bought this double CD mainly for the remastered sound of the album ""Heart like a Wheel"", and it looks like a good deal to get all her early works remastered on a double CD set. But I need to adjust the treble down to make this work better. Otherwise Linda's voice would come out somewhat high-pitch w/ what I got. So I cannot give it a 5-star for that reason. They also release her next five albums as original series; but w/o remastering the sound I would not pay for these music again since I already got the original vinyl."
2,Snowflake Charm too small,"I'm giving this snowflake charm a low rating because of the size. If it would be larger, it would be gorgeous. Photos on the internet can be deceiving. This snowflake charm is a little smaller than a dime."
5,SPREADING ANTHRAX!!!!!,"WOW! This is a great THrash Punk METAL album!!!! ANTHRAX really found their sound with Joe Belladona...His debut here brings another dimension to the IRON MAIDEN/JUDAS PRIEST fusion ANTHRAX were doing on their great debut FISTFUL OF METAL...while Neil Turbin was a fusion between Rob Halford and Paul Di'anno, Belladona is more like a punk Bruce Dickinson...Fistful is great, but i think is on SPREADING THE DISEASE where ANTHRAX become something more...A.I.R, MADHOUSE, STAND OR FALL, THE ENEMY, AFTERSHOCK and MEDUSA are great METAL tunes...well, this one, AMONG THE LIVING and PERSISTENCE OF TIME are the best from ANTHRAX with Joe vocals....REALLY GREAT!!!!!!WELL DONE, ANTHRAX!!!!!!!"
5,Great Album,This is great thrash album i love AIR the first song on this album just tells ya how good Anthrax is. Anyways the whole album is good buy this and don't forget Anthrax's best album Among The Living. Spreading The Disease and Among The Living is Anthrax's best albums in my books. Great Thrash Metal!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,It's a Mad House...,"Of all the other major thrash bands, Anthrax is one of the few who sounded almost upbeat instead of using the much grimmer sounds of most thrash bands. While I have no problem with either sound, if I ever get weary of such grim songs, I can switch to the much more fun sounding Anthrax. And who could possibly forget driving down the streets of Vice City causing mayhem to ""Madhouse"" in Grand Theft Auto Vice City?"
4,Four and a half stars,"No question that this is a classic of the thrash genre, although I won't say it's quite as good as Among the Living. Killer metal riffs, chugging tempos, often-humorous lyrics and the occasional goofball singalong chorus are the Anthrax trademark and STD has plenty of it. In addition to the loveable 'Madhouse', serious headbanging fun is to be had with 'A.I.R.' 'Stand or Fall' and 'Aftershock', while the closer 'Gung-Ho' is one of the fastest tracks I've heard from them. Not the very best thrash CD I've heard, but certainly up there."
5,Screams! In the Night.....,"People will constantly tell you how good Among The Living is, and how it is superior to any Anthrax album. In my opinion, this is wrong!This is one of the best thrash albums released with vocals you can hear. Not only that, but Anthrax possessed from 1985 to 1992 one of the greatest singers of the genre : Joey Belladonna. And this is why this album is the greatest Anthrax release, because this was recorded at the only stage in their career when they perfectly fused British Metal with Hardcore and the thrash sound. Check out Joey's singing on 'A.I.R', 'Lone Justice', 'The Enemy', all amazing songs, and the highlights for me. Other highlights include 'Madhouse', 'Gung Ho' and the amazing 'Medusa', which is sooooo cool. This album has that rush to it, and the musicianship is on top form, whcih is why you should buy this album now metalheads! This should be a classic, make it one by purchasing now"
5,Where the classic Anthrax sound began,"Fistful of Metal was a Kiss on speed sounding record, average vocalist, average songs, average band. On this recording, Spreading the Disease, new singer Joey Belladonna steps in and not only do the songs improve, so does the production and the overall product, as well as the band. Joey's voice really helped push this band. Modern day Anthrax is now sporting John Bush and the results are day and night, no longer classic Anthrax. There isn't a dud on this CD, the boys come at you with their ""gang"" backing vocals that help make these Anthrax songs. 9 great tracks, although there are A.I.R, Madhouse, Armed & Dangerous, and Lone Justice that rise to the top. This CD comes from a time when metal was new and we didn't have or worry about MTV. Their best behind ""Among the Living""."
3,Impressionistic but generally interesting memories of a long life with books,"These intertwined memoirs cover the lives of Leona Rostenberg and Madeleine Stern, who blazed a new path for women in the book business. The stories are more sketches than portraits, although I enjoyed most the section on book selling, including a listing of all the ways in which the bookstores of their past are now just memories.I suspect that the reviewer who states that Old Books, Rare Friends is better probably has a point, although I haven't read that book. There is a sense here of oft-told tales. Still, it's worth reading for the part on their lives together selling books."
5,Awesome,"5 stars for sure, one of the best shows out there! If you are new to the show, warning: it might not be the most family friendly, but it is great for hanging out with friends and laughing your ass off."
3,"Started out strong, but the last couple (8 and 9) of episodes","...they seem to have lost the funny touch. Maybe out of ideas but raunch is only funny if done right and normally they deliver in spades. Just the last couple episodes, so far of season 4 have gone over the top and/or were just not really funny. Epi 1-7 were great though."
2,What Happened??,"I simply don't know how a show which came off its funniest season to date COULD completely jump the shark with that abomination of a first Season 4 episode. I am tired of all the 'sports related' guest appearances. I understand the premise of the show is far-fetched to begin with, but at least try to make it a bit more relatable to those of us that actually indulge in a bit of fantasy football. Seasons 1-3 did a phenomenal job of doing so, but all of a sudden now you have these guys being whisked away to Cowboys training camp, or having a different athlete every week be in the middle of the story line. ENOUGH! What saved this season from getting a 1 star was the Hoodie Episode. More Episodes like this, Less Episodes like the 1st one or the one where Kevin is running for Judge (HORRIBLE! but fast becoming the norm)."
1,Boring and unfunny episode,"I am a huge fan of the first three seasons. But this season opener is pathetic. This episode attempts to replace raw, edgy humor with about 9 billion cameos from football players and coaches. If I wanted to see football players, I'd watch football. When I watch The League, I want it to be funny."
1,Yikes!,"While the first three seasons were highly juvenile, there were enough chuckles to make it worth watching. However, I would strongly caution past viewers from paying almost $2 per episode to watch pretty much all the same old jokes re-hashed. Perhaps $10 would be worth it for the whole season, but the current price is simply too high."
5,Awesome,"Hilarious, energetic. The league is one of the best shows on TV. I own all 4 seasons and I don't even watch football."
2,Lazy season for a great show,"I really loved the first 3 seasons. They have lost some steam in season 4. If you see an early Rafi sighting ... watch the whole episode, it's worth it."
2,Not about fantasy football anymore,"There were still a few decent jokes, but the show has nothing to do with fantasy football anymore, which was really the draw before."
3,Weak Sauce,"In my opinion, the show went too ridiculous this season. The jokes and premises became less and less believable, and the chemistry was just not as sharp as it has been in seasons past. Here is hoping that next season is a return to the low-brow, sharp banter that makes this show spectacular. (3.25 stars)"
5,Love this show,"This is a great show, absolutely hilarious and unlike anything else on television. Buying it on Amazon makes it so convenient to watch it whenever you want."
5,Season 4 does not disappoint,"Love The League Season 4: The ""Breastalizer"" episode was classic Raffi. Gotta love it!!!!! The constant ripping on Andre is always a classic!"
4,Hilarious!,This show just gets funnier every season and it provides an inside look at the lives of the fantasy-league obsessed and how their lives can literally revolve around football.
5,Back on track,"The first episode of the 4th season of the The League shows that they are back on the right track. Rather than bending a little too far into dark and personal story lines that plagued the 3rd season they go back to the 50/50 formula that made the first 2 seasons so funny. Also as a consequence of the return to form, any child that should be born to me will now be named Chalupa Batman."
2,may have jumped a shark,The first couple of episodes were pretty funny. The rest of the episodes seemed to be crude without a point to being crude. The show has gradually become less funny because as the show has progressed they have dealt less and less with the fantasty football aspect of the show. The charecters and plots of episodes have become less believable. It is too bad because this once was one of the better shows out there.
4,Lighthouse,Eugenia Price's books are always great. I've read most of them and was surprised to find I've not read this series yet.Loved it!
5,A good historical novel,"If you like Historical novels, you will love the writings of Eugenia Price. She was known to go to graveyards, look at a tombstone and do research on that person and then build her story around that. I've read all her novels and am looking forward to a re-read of this one."
5,Lighthouse,I love this book because Eugenia Price has captured the lives of the people of St Simons Island in a wonderful way. I have the St Simons Trilogy on my Kindle and it will always be there when I need something to read. I'm on my third time reading it. I love all of Eugenia Price's books.
1,dull writing,"Personally I hate bullies, which is just what the syndicate is on a grand scale. My librarian tho askedme to give it a test run and I did, as far as I could anyway, which was page 48. The writing was justtoo dull and simpleton. Mr. Gambino should of hired himself a good writer to breath some life intothe life."
1,Rates ZERO STARS-The Author Is A Con Man-NOT Michael Gambino,"According to today's(Aug.28th)edition of the New York Post-the headlines are screaming about how this book was a total lie-Michael Gambino is actually a smalltime Vegas con man named Michael Pellegrino. Pellegrino didn't spend half as much time in jail as he's written in this book. The real Michael Gambino is Carlo's great grandson-a 16 yr. old still in high school. Don't waste your time or your money on this, folks. Not recommended at all."
1,The Author Is A God,"Or atleast he thinks so. If it were up to Mr. Gambino he would have you think not only did he create the wheel but also every vehcile it goes on. I think he spent so much time reading and listening to stories about the mafia that that he actual believed himself to be the mafia. If Mr. Gambino only had writen the stories as they were told to him the book may have been ok, but probally not! The title should have been Mikey Gambino One Man Mafia ."
1,The Honored Society,"Pure trash !I read a wide variety of material and this book belongs at the very bottom. Contains no redeeming features for author or book.If one enjoys sloshing through the slime it may be of interest, otherwise cross this one out."
3,Very pleasant,"Very nice story and message but meaning is lost on my 4 year old. The illustrations too are pleasant but not as captivating as I had hoped for. Even at this young age, my daughter is looking for a story with strongly defined characters and some type of climax and resolution. The message is a good one, but punch!"
5,We're on our second book...,"We read our first copy so many times it became extremely worn, especially when the little ones would look at the book themselves. So, we purchased another copy that remains on mom's shelf for safekeeping--one that will be returned to when the kids are grown up and have children of their own.This book appeals to children because of the delightful pictures that are so detailed they draw you into the story itself. Children are naturally drawn to nature, so this short book, which features a different season for each verse and is loaded with close-ups of animals, is particularly attractive to young children. Older children will like just looking at the pictures.I would recommend buying this book just for the illustrations."
5,Gorgeous illustrations,"Both my 4-year-old and 1-year-old enjoy this simple, moving story about a kindly fairy. Henterly's illustrations are magnificent."
2,Runs much smaller than other New Balance shorts,"I have several pair of NB shorts in size medium and they fit great. But these run extremely small. (I'm wondering if this batch was mislabeled.) They're also very high-waisted, sitting above my waistline. Try yours on first! Don't make the same mistake I did by washing them first, then trying them on thinking they would fit like all my other NB shorts!! No returns for me!"
5,True Witchcraft,"This is not a wiccan book at all. If you believe in wicca then stay away. This book is about true witchcraft as a practice, not religion. If you are interested in working with the spirits and practicing witchcraft then you have discovered your book. There is no mention of Karma here and there shouldnt be, karma is a hindu concept not a witch's."
4,From a Satanist's point of view...,"I am a satanist. After reading this book (so far) I realize that Paul Huson does not make the ever-made distinction between, ""White & Black"" magic. Magic is Magic. Step by step, he teaches how to do all of the things he describes, and makes the distinction between what is essential and what is optional. Once I started reading ""Mastering Witchcraft"" I couldn't put it down. And whether you are a beginner, an old pro, or just reading for education/entertainment, I suggest this book for you."
1,Avoid,"This book is a hodge podge of Ceremonial Magick, Wicca, and the fantasies of the Inquisition passed off as ""real"" Witchcraft. True, their are people who practice Witchcraft outside Gardner and Wicca, but I doubt you will see a book by them. They are very diverse and many do follow their practice as a religion and not ""just a craft"". Many are also bound by oath, not to reveal there practices to anyone. The craft is passed many times only to those who the signs say should learn it, even in the family. I really wish I had paid attention to the sub title ""For Witches, Warlocks. . ."". Warlock means oath breaker it's an insult. First clue on the spot a phoney list, Warlock. I have a good friend who is a real Trad Witch, and can trace her lineage back to the ""burning times"", I'm going to give this to her as a gift, a GAG GIFT!"
1,RUBBISH!!,"I wish that there was a way to have actually stated on the rating drop-down ""0 Star""The VERY first give away that this book was complete rubbish whaat when Mr. Hudson referred to himself as a ""warlock"". It was downhill from there.When speaking to Anthropology classes studying religion, magic and witchcraft, this is my example of a ""do not buy""."
1,THIS BOOK REEKS,"First of all, you don't master witchcraft. Can you master a religion? NO, NO, NO. You cannot master witchcraft. You follow it, practice it, and live by its one law. This auther calls male witches ""worlocks."" I am a male witch, I am a witch, not a worlock. Worlock means traitor or oath-breaker. There is a chapter in this book called vengence and attack, whata load of TRASH. All REAL witches now that attack and vengence is strickly against the wiccan rede. Keep away from this book. If you want to read a truthfull book on what witchcraft really is, then read books by Scott Cunningham, Silver Ravenwolf, Laurie Cabot, or Ray Buckland. This book should not even be allowed in the section with the rest of the wicca books. It is trash, don't read it!"
4,Not for beginners.,"Huson's book has lots of good solid information about magick and various magical practices, but it's not for the beginner, and some of the included information falls well outside the Wiccan Rede, so watch your step and read it with that in mind"
1,"Like it or not, it shook up the early 70's","I'm a witch in my 40's and the first two books on the Craft I read were this one and Leek's Diary of a Witch. I even remember seeing Paul Huson plugging the book on the tv game show, ""To Tell The Truth"".So what do we have here? An interesting mix of witchcraft, ceremonial magick, ""satanism"" (that crap about repeating the lord's prayer backwards)and ethics-free suggestions about spellcasting, as well as some intriguing guidelines on coven organization.Do I recomend it? Certainly not for any beginners. I do think its an important work in the cannon of Craft history, for the sake of being one of the very first best sellers about actual, practical magic. I think it belongs in a coven library for this reason, but not for use as a working text. Like A. Crowley, there are some gems here...but you have to dig through a great deal of stuff that makes many readers uncomfortable.Read it for it's historical value. Go elsewhere for Craft intruction."
1,don't get your hopes up,"this isn't a tradition of witchcraft it is a mix of all kinds of things cerimonial magic, black magic, necromancy (just to name a few ) in this book the author claims that witchcraft is still selling your soul for magic powers (read the introduction if you don't believe me) it just doesn't say to who. (how convient.)i don't believe pagan is the only form of witchcraft and i think one could use this in witchcraft however this book doesn't discribe any traditional practice of witchcraft it's just the author putting together a ""stewpot"" of magical elements into one single book"
1,Not witchcraft,"While there may be some magical techniques in the book, it has very little, if anything to do with pagan religions, or witchcraft. Saying a prayer backwards might be good for the movies, but other than being borderline gibberish, borderline teenybopper rebel satanist, is not a good way to truly start. And loving that after he instructs you to do this, gives you a ""blessed be""."
5,Classic 70s occult fare,"While not the happy go lucky book of rites n' rituals that we've come to expect in Craft literature, and while it's usually heavily criticized and proclaimed as illegitimate by Wiccans, this is actually one of the very few mass market books that deal with Traditional Craft practices. Highly recommended."
3,Attack or not?,"Mastering Witchcraft by Paul Huson was one of the first books that I read dealing with the subject. I found it refreshing in that it didn't deal with ""goddess worship"" or basic candle magick. I did find that it could induce paranoia. Most of the book deals with methods of attack or protection. He also seemed to have an obsession with Habondia and Cernunnos. It was entertaining though and there's one method that I did like alot. The Black Fast section helps me to quiet myself and at the same time energize for an upcoming spell. It helps the mage to concentrate on the target of the spell. in his work, it was for use mainly for spells to harm, but I find it useful for both Magick black and white."
3,Just OK,"Ok. That's all I can say, OK. Not bad, not great.Buy this CD if you want to have fun listening to it whilst cleaning your apartment. Background music at it's best.... Don't get me wrong - they are both talented music makers and DJ's alike, but this is a prime example of trying too hard. The mix is fluid but choppy. Interesting and boring in the same sentence. A compilation CD on vitamin enriched diet coke. 2manydjs with a hard-on. I could go on..... but you get the point.Both these guys are capable of so much better than this and I know that this is an album that will soon be collecting dust on my shelf.Masturbation is best done in private when nobody else can hear it."
5,Wish I could rate it higher than five stars.,"My wife and I discovered Daniel O'Donnell on PBS a few weeks ago. This artist is excellent. We love him. This cd is also excellent. Highly recommend to anyone who likes easy listening, melodic music."
4,Great to find this here!,It is hard to find such oriental products in the grocery store and driving to an oriental store is just troubling. It is really nice to see this product on here with a very reasonable price.
2,drippy,Mr misty is mister drippy as far as using it in a tub shower. It makes heavy wet mist that soon has my floor very wet and slippery. I instead hooked it to my reverse osmosis water filter and installed it in the plenum of my gas forced air furnace. It works very well in that location because of the high air flow and the heat. One needs an electronic humidifier solenoid valve connected to the humidifier terminals of the furnace (and a water pipe)to make it work well. If your RO filter goes nova then you will get tell tale white dust everywhere. A good RO filter should last a few years though.JL
5,This Product Works Extremely Well,"I purchased this product around the holidays last year and have been extremely happy with it. It was a breeze to install and it saves me a ton of time from having to fill up my traditional humidifier every other day. It does make a minor hissing noise when the steam is let out. Also, be sure not to leave anything in your shower that you wouldn't want to be damp for a very extended period of time. I have definitely noticed that the static electricity during the dry winter months is much less. I am very happy with mine and am going to buy a second one as a gift. One thing that I noticed that may cut down on the effectiveness is if you have a vent in your bathroom that automatically sucks out air. You have to cover it up or shut it off to get the full effect of the humidity."
2,"Dampened bathroom and nearby carpet, but not rest of house","I like the concept of the Mr. Misty, and suffer from lots of static shock and dry everything here in the desert. So, I gave the he/she a chance, and then returned it a week or so later. I wasn't happy with how wet everything became in the bathroom area -- the ceiling and walls were damp, bathtub full of water droplets, and dampened carpet just outside the bathroom. On my 1600 square foot home, Mr. Misty had little to no chance of making improvements outside the master bedroom, it just created a very lopsided change in humidity. So, back to the retailer he/she went.Those living in more humid parts of the country can do more than just imagine the things that grow in standing water..."
1,Mr Misty,worked for a month then clogged up and is unuseable. great idea with poorly engineered parts - cheap plastic. Don't buy if you want it to last more than a couple of weeks.
4,been waiting,"I have been looking for a year for the short sleeve thermal type shirt, and I finally got one. I like it, but they don't go smaller than small, so it is to large for me, but I am keeping it to wear with loose tops. I can't wear it with slighly snug tops. Other than the size and that I have a couple of wishes I would buy another"
3,too small. always order a size bigger,"I used the product for many years and I like it a lot since I am older I canuse the warm, soft, etc. But these ones were at least one size smaller."
4,Don't Put Cuddle Duds in the Dryer,"I like to wear the cuddle duds in the winter under my work clothes. Very warm and not bulky. After washing in gentle cycle, dry on a rack to prevent shrinking (other customers review)."
2,Consider something else,"I purchased this program and found it to be annoying in it's redundancy. The Pimsleur method may work for some, but it didn't work very well for me. Your mileage may vary.The more expensive Pimsleur versions contain readings which enhance the experience, but not much. For similar money consider Eurotalk's Talk Now! Polish which is a computer application using picture, written word, and spoken word association. I found it to be superior to Pimsleur and Rosetta Stone in every regard. See my review of that title."
2,slow,The entire Pimsleur series that I have encountered is mind numbingly boring with endless repetition of the same basic phrases. I learned much more Polish with one World Talk CD than with the 5 Pimsleur CDs. I had the same objection to the Pimsleur Romanian CDs.
2,Not the ULTIMAX,"Disappointed! The picture shows these sox as ULTIMAX. I have some older ULTIMAX sox and this is not the same. Kept the name and changed the soxs. While these soxs appear to be good soxs, when compared to my previous ULTIMAX they don't measure up. The original ULTIMAX are thicker and the knitting is visibly denser."
1,Wrong advertising,"I ordered L socks. The socks were labeled L. But the socks were very SMALL, do not fit, are useless.Quality, color, fast delivery were fine. But what good is that if I can't wear the socks. And I can't think of a 10-year old that would wear those socks."
3,Ok,The socks were kind of wimpy for the 12$ price and started to unravel a little. So I would not buy these again
5,comfort #1,"Very comfortable, warm, thin, and has extra padding where the the tongue of your shoe rides. Great sock, great price. X-mas is coming, stuff a stocking."
3,Good but Over-Priced,"Bought a pair to compare to cheaper socks from Wigwam that I like. Great socks, but not really worth the extra expense."
5,"My Little Piggies are going""Wee Wee Wee!"" ""We love our Wigwams!""",Expensive. But worth it. They don't get stinky and crusty like other sox. This is due I'm sure to their moisture wicking feature.
4,a good place to begin,"This book gives a basic detail of where to start, some simple recipes and lots of really helpful tips. I really liked it and have moved on to other books with more complex recipes and that's just what I expected from this book."
2,The Title Says It All,"I bought this book hoping to learn how to make better home-cooked vegetarian meals. While I thought it was a nice, informative introduction to vegetarian cooking for those new to vegetarianism, as a long-time lacto-ovo vegetarian who wants to improve her cooking skills, I didn't find it very helpful. In my opinion,too much time was spent discussing things about vegetarianism that I already knew about (e.g., vegetarian philosophy, etc.) and not enough time spent on cooking techniques and recipes. So, I recommend this book only to people new to vegetarianism (guess that'll teach me not to pay more attention to book titles!). Culinary challenged, long-time vegetarians such as myself might be better off looking elsewhere."
1,Bad Kids-Bad Book,"Adding nothing new to the world of juvenile law, Barry Feld once more demonstrates the gap between academia and real life. It is apparant that the author is either naive or has no real or practical experience with delinquents, the juvenile system or the politics of criminal courts. The book contains no new ideas, insights or real solutions to the limitations of our juvenile system or the issues facing today's families and thier chidren. Rather, Feld merely rehashes revisionist histories and opinions of other academics and concludes that because a greater number of delinquents have been treated as adult offenders over the last decade, we should scrap the system altogather thus literally throwing the baby out with the bath. It is not suprising that the positive reviews of this book have all been from other academics. It is a shame our ""scholars"" cannot offer better than this."
2,Not as good as it seemed,"Not as good as it seemed, would have liked a better fit. Not pleased, will not but this item from Amazon sellers again."
1,yeah yeah yeah.,hmmmm.. the name of the band says it all. should you listen to this band sometime? yeah. sometime NEVER. singer chris reynold's vocals are mediocre at best and the lyrics so ridden with cliches that one wonders why this band would want to make a permanent record of their work. seeing them open for low was one of those moments where you watch someone embarrass his/her self and you cringe because it's painful. do you stay for support? or do you you just walk away? most people did the latter. save your money. support your local band that opens for low because this one isnt' worth the bucks. there is no time for idle dreaming in my life and there certainly is no time for this generic blah blah blah disc.
4,a good book,A young man must break away from his mother and her life before he can discover a life of his own.
4,Comprehensive and useful,"This is a good, solid summary of Greek Mythology. It does not try to oversimplify or codify. It is not a book for those who want pleasant stories; it is a book for those who want some flavor of what it was like. Nor does he bowdlerize; The stories are crude and beautiful and a challenge to those still inhibited by the nonsense of ""paganism"" and ""heathens.""He does, however, have a point of view that really intrudes only in the introduction. His privilege. Otherwise, you're in the company of a fine scholar and a fine writer."
3,Bed Of Roses,"A good effort as the Statlers made the move from Cash's back up quartet to being independent. Not fond of ""The Junkie's Prayer"", but ""Tomorrow Never Comes"" and others songs are very good. Great that I could get this on CD. Hope they put more Statlers work on CD soon."
3,"it's calming and mellowing, yet makes you think....","while the music seems to have a calming effect, it's a bit unsetling also. as the movie goes along and you want to scream what's going to hapen, then cry when things aren't right, that's how this is. it make's the emotions flow. it's a great thing to listen to if you are in the mood. if you don't enjoy this type of music, then don't bother with this one."
4,Brilliant shot on video (VHS) movie,"When you think of John McBride, you really never think of a brilliant movie. You think of a fun, cheap shot on video movie experience. This movie for me is still and will always be his best effort.For a shot on VHS movie you'd think everything would suck, from the gore to the acting and surely the directing. This movie seemed to have a lot going for it. The acting wasn't great, but it was pretty good. The killer were nicely contrived and acted, the blood and gore was phenominal for such a low budget production.It's a fun, fun movie. Loved it."
2,The Unicorn by Iris Murdoch,"This novel can be summarized simply and briefly. If you like Jerry Springer, you'll love ""The Unicorn"". It is not even close to reality."
3,"Good, could have been better","Like most of the other reviewers here I found that Charlotte Gray didn't come close to Birdsong - but maybe it is unfair to compare the too. Charlotte is a good read. I came to care deeply about all of the characters and was eager to see what would happen to them. The one part of the story that rings false is the love story between Charlotte and Peter. Much like the granddaughter in Birdsong, this plot seemed contrived as a way to tell the rest of the story. Faulks is at his best describing life in ""Free"" France and the people who lived there. His prose brings the landscape and even the smells to life. From anyone else this would have probably been considered a wonderful book, maybe it's just that from Faulks we've come to expect a bit more."
5,A Chilling Truth Of The Holocaust Rarely Bettered,"The story of Charlotte is peripheral to the eventual all-pervading horror of the treatment of Andre and Jacob. In its never-ending awfulness, you want, desperately, to reach into the book and save them. Of course you cannot and so are but a helpless observer as they pass from one hell to a worse one and then on to their deaths. I have never felt so emotionally drained by a book. I now carry these images with me. I wish I didn't but I know I, and everyone else, should. The final 150 pages are very difficult to come to terms with. But then, why should we ever find it easy to come to terms with genocide?""It's only a story,"" someone said to me. Except, of course, it is anything but."
3,"A casual review of ""Charlotte Gray""","I really liked the recent movie ""Charlotte Gray"" starring Cate Blanchett. The book is rather dryly written. Unless someone is really into English literature, I wouldn't bother taking the time to slog through it."
3,Not bad -- although Charlotte was less than convincing!,"Faulks writes of this young lady Charlotte who is taken to France on a mission that is not altogether true and stays longer than intended. Prior to this she falls hopelessly (and somewhat unconvincingly) in love with the pilot Peter Gregory.Throughout her stay at the Domaine, her focus remains on the lost love of Gregory and not perhaps on the WWII which she is surrounded by. I found that Charlotte's story didn't ring true for the short time that she knew her love.The book was particularly long and fluffy and perhaps would have achieved the same end if a lot of it was cut out. Perhaps then I would have given it 4 stars."
2,A sorry disappointment,"Faulks probably made most of his royalties from me INSISTING to friends that they buy Birdsong. I LOVED that book with a passion, and so swooped on Charlotte Grey. I found it utterly uninvolving, the characters as flat as the pages they were written on and the plot had no ability to hold me. I was SOOOO disappointed. I look forward to the next Faulks with some apprehension."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I Love books set in war-time, so it seem natural to read ""Charlotte Gray"" by Sebastian Faulks. Well I finished it all that I can say that it seem uninspiring to me.Charlotte Gray is a young Scottish woman who moves to London during the war to work, after meeting and quickly falling in love with a pilot, who then quickly get shot down over France. Charlotte who of course can speak near-perfect French, decides to become a spy and go to France to find her pilot/lover. While in France she get invovled with a resistance leader.Mr. Faulks seems to make everyone but Charlotte flawed and of course everything is easy for Charlotte to get to France to find her love. There are better war-time books out there and its not ""Charlotte Gray."""
2,Charlotte Gray (a lot of nothing ?),"I read Birdsong and enjoyed it. I bought Charlotte Grey hoping for more of the same but was dissapointed. After reading it I was left thinking ""what was it all about"" ? I think the author has a funny style of writing in that he goes into great detail about things that appear unimportant (even irrelvant) but skips by things which are central to the story (like the capture of the children). In the book the death of the old man in the camp is dealt with in less than a page after being a key character throughout. Whilst reading it I was constanly waiting for something (anything) to happen but sadly it naver did and in the end it fizzled out like a damp firework. I intended to buy the third book in the trilogy but after Charlotte Gray I don't think I'll bother. In summary the book was a lot about nothing"
2,Just couldn't stick with it,"Charlotte Gray was not at all what I expected; I read the first 70 pages or so and found it slow and dull. After that I skimmed for another 40 pages or so before admitting defeat. So glad I got my copy at the library. For a much better treatment of the same subject matter, read Simon Mawer's Trapeze."
3,An overused subject but from a new perspective.,"I bought this book because the plot seemed to be somewhat original for the world war times. I was not prepared for a soap opera. I guess I expected somewhat of a different approach by Faulks. Still, it was a semi-interesting book."
4,"A summer read, when you don't have to worry about time...","Faulks' flawed and interesting novel can occupy your vacation time, while you are at the beach and have nothing else to do. One young lady who read this book said that it made her ""cross,"" because the heroine seems so dippy and ineffectual. Another person said that the book lapses unrealistically in its description of spying and the French Resistance. Yet a third friend said that the father-daughter ""trauma"" and the concentration camp overlay were unnecessary or out of place.True, you will not be disturbed by strong women or reality in this book. Still, this is a good book for your vacation time, schmaltzy and frothy and not too bad, unless you happen to require strong, unselfconcious women in your novels. This is not Jane Austin or Tom Clancy, but I liked it, anyway, on a hot summer day."
4,recommend the audio book,"Sam West's interpretation of the characters in Charlotte Gray made the book well worth ""listening to"" - he's fantastic. His inflections and characterizations are consistent and show imagination and strength. I had to share side 2 of the first tape with all my sisters. Those who have listened will know what I mean."
4,Pure entertainment,"While not as viscerally charged as Birdsong, this book does succeed on an entertainment level. The characters and plotlines are interesting and the pacing is wonderful. Enjoy it for what it is instead of comparing it to other books."
1,"Dull, dull, dull","This was very dull reading. I had to force myself to finish it. The love story is not at all compelling and the two lovers never had an interesting conversation. With all the opportunities for suspense in this book, there is none. In France, Charlotte disobeys orders to return to England and spends the money alloted her by the SOE on new clothes and panties for herself, instead of helping people in the Resistance. It makes the SOE look incompetent when they praise her for doing a good job. The token ""snitch"" in the French village is a cliché character. The Jewish story did not work, and Charlotte's hanging out in front of the concentration camp was ludicrous. I suspect this was a ""bottom-of-the-drawer"" manuscript that the author submitted after the success of ""Birdsong."" I hope the movie will be better than the book."
2,Good story but dull characters,"I agree with the other reviewers who said the characters were dull. I felt compelled to finish the book, but it was the story itself that intrigued me. I kept hoping Charlotte and others would come to life and display some passion, but it was never to be. The only part of the story which touched me and was heartbreakingly sad, was the fate of the two little brothers who were killed in the camp at Drancy. This book never came close to the author's previous offering, Birdsong."
3,No better than alright....,"I agree with those who have rated this as an OK book but nothing special - although the scenes in which the two small boys are sent to the concentration camp seem all the more harrowing in the contxt of the central character's generally unisnpiring ""adventures"" in France. However, don't give up on Faulkes if you haven't read Birdsong. There is no comparison between the literary worth and emotional punch of these two novels: Birdsong will tear you apart even before you get to the trench warfare. Please read it."
2,"A bit of a disappointment after ""Birdsong""","""Birdsong"" was one of my favourite books so I was looking forward to reading ""Charlotte Gray"".To say that it is not in the same league as ""Birdsong"" is an understatement-it is almost as if it was written by a different author.I thought the characters were shallow and the dialogue at times unbelievable.Faulks will have to try harder-he can't trade on the success of ""Birdsong"" forever.The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that as a Scot living in France,the background details of the German occupation were quite interesting."
2,A love story? No way,"I thought this book was so good at the begining and enjoyed the first few chapters but then what happened????? She ends up in France looking for some guy she met a few times and it's meant to be some wonderful love story. Who cares! Boring, boring, boring........"
2,Decent airplane book but nothing more,"I would not recommend anyone buying this book. If you are curious, check it out from the library. The character development is shallow and the story is generally not well written. The readers who have enjoyed this must be very young, and therefore not exposed to the better writers of the past. I put a lot of blame on the editor of this book, as it is his job to assist the writer in preparing the manuscript. I will not read this author again."
1,Total waste of money,"Let me start out by stating that I've been a loyal Rush fan since the early 80's, and still am. This DVD has the poorest production quality of any DVD ever! It's obviously something that a couple of people threw together in an hour (maybe less). I thought it was gonna be a concert video, but it's just a collection of their music videos.There is noticable static on the Red Barchetta track (on a DVD???). Some of the videos don't fade out completely, they just start to fade, then freeze, and then end. The production company that made this is totally trying to rip off fans. This is certainly not representative of the band or their own production values."
3,Disappointing...,"This DVD is disappointing because the quality is not great. (My VHS copy looks just as good.) Also, it seems that not much care was given to the menu design. The overall feel is that the label is just trying to cash in on what already exists in their archives. Some restoration/remastering is definitely in order here."
2,no need to rush,"Rush is the greatest band on the planet... musically. As a video band, they are abysmal. Every video here is either pure cheese or poor-quality concert footage. The overall quality isn't better than the VHS version, and the only extras are two additional videos that should've stayed in the vaults. Maybe this DVD is a good intro for new fans, but there's nothing different here to really offer the Rush fanatic."
3,Beware if you have an HD TV,This DVD was made at 5.0 aspect ratio so the video quality is not that hot but good enough to view anyway.It's a great collection of their music videos including some old stuff.
2,HORRIBLE MONO sound on videos,"NO excuse! No excuse to release this DVD in 2001 and use the MONO versions for the videos! Just pathetic! I really wanted to kick back and enjoy some Rush videos and they are all MONO! I mean come on! It dont take much work to re-edit them using Stereo and 5.1 mixes! Plus they left out ""the Body electric"", ""Vital Signs"" and ""show dont tell"". Really bad all the way around! The CD version comes with a booklet and all, this one...NOTHING! No booklet, no insert, No Bonus material! They phoned this DVD in!"
3,rush chronicles,"I have owned this video for a long time and i'm getting mad. i might be retarded, but how do you fine the hidden songs the enemy with in and afterimage. I have watched this dvd many many times and can never find them can any one help."
3,Rush DVD's,"Well, I own this DVD, and the video quality is almost the same as the VHS, but it's cool. However, I highly recommend you to wait, in this 2003 year, they said that they are releasing a LIVE DVD! Not the Exit... Stage Left DVD, nor the A Show of Hands DVD, nor the Grace Under Pressure, or th Different Stages DVD, they aren't expecting to release any of these videos. They are going to release the 'Rush in Rio DVD', recorded at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on the last year. It's the largest concert that Rush has ever played. Also, it will include some Behind-The-Scenes footage, and it will be surely better that the Chronicles DVD..."
3,Sad but true,"I'll keep this short and to the point. While Rush is one of the greatest bands ever, this dvd is a disapointment. The quality is not very good and I play it on a $1300.00 dvd player. I am going to keep it as there is nothing else by Rush on dvd. But Mercury could have done them better justice. Shame Shame!!!!"
3,"Not bad, but awful selection","This DVD spans Rush from 77-87. Highlghts include an excellent live version (in a studio or concert hall of some kind, not live audience) of The Trees, and the same with Closer to the Heart (although this one is lip synched directly from Kings). I found the DVD quality quite good. But totally disagreed with the selection of videos. Too much from Power Windows and Hold Your Fire (the 2 albums that basically ruined this once KILLER band). Afterimage cranks,as well as Red Sector A, taken from the Pressure tour video. Highly recommended. 31/2 stars. Also of note are Sawyer and Limelight, filmed in LeStudio during the recording of Moving Pictures (less than a month after I saw them in concert...awesome show baby. These guys sure were terrific back then)."
4,This is a start.,"I love this DVD. It has all the videos of the songs that are during the timeline of the album. I would love to see all of their home videos come out on DVD, and supposedly they are except for Different Stages, sometime during the first half of this year. One thing I want to point out about this DVD is that it doesnt automatically play all the tracks in a row. You have to go to the options menu to set it on that mode. The reason I only gave it 4 stars is because these facts, but otherwise a must-have for the RUSH enthusiast!"
5,Big Yes for Rush!,"Yes, Yes, Yes!!! I have Chronicles on VHS, but am eager to get the DVD version. These are classic videos by one of the best rock bands ever, so it's easy to see why I'm so excited! Rush rocks and Chronicles, with the bonus video of Afterimage, is what I need to tide me over til their new album is released 1Q 2002!!!"
1,How can you review something you haven't seen or experienced,"You people need to wait until you actually see this before you can review. You so desperately want this to be great because it is RUSH. I love RUSH, but let's get real. I do not want to buy just because it is RUSH. Remember that the record lables are involved, so there is always compromise. I hope it is great, but your bogus reviews do not help anyone."
5,Classic Rush Tunes on DVD,"These are not fancy videos, pretty much just studio shots of the band performing. The later songs have more of an ""MTV"" flavor. If you are a die-hard Rush fan who loves the old tunes, this is a must have. It also reminds you of how long these guys have been playing."
3,Vintage Rush Captured in '70s and '80s Videos,"Unfortunately, Rush's videos do not compare to their music, as is evident in this collection of songs from their greatest-hits album, ""Chronicles"". It opens with an almost comical ""Closer to the Heart"", each band member clad in KKK-like robes (sans hoods). One can get a good look at Geddy Lee's facility on the bass on a few of these tracks, as well as Neil Peart's intensity on the drum set. ""Subdivisions"" is illustrated well conceptually, but broken at a few points with a very fake Alex Lifeson's backing vocals. ""Red Barchetta"" shows just how dorky old videos can look nowadays, with a sound wave turning into a car and zooming off in the song's intro. The high point of the video is ""Limelight"", which is just straight studio recording footage. But it can't make up for the rest of the video. Considering how good Rush's music is, it shouldn't be a surprise that their videos are such a disappointment. For die-hard Rush fans only ..."
3,We want MORE!!!!!,"This is a great addition to th RUSH collection. But there are, alot of videos which could have, filled the extra space. The, quality is good but the VHS is, just as good. All in all they could have released the live DVD of the Test for Echo tour which they did record but I guess Atlantic is waiting. That is what we want. A new live DVD we deserve it well we would buy it."
4,A farily good DVD collection of Rush,"Rush is an excellent, ground-breaking trio. Geddy Lee was a major reason, along with The Who's John Entwistle, why I picked up the electric bass in 1983. This DVD has very interesting moments, but the VHS-like video quality on a couple of selections on this DVD are a bit frustrating. Rush is one of the best, and hopefully when the powers-that-be re-release ""Exit Stage Left"" and their other concert videos on DVD, the quality won't vary as much and the DVDs will be longer in length. They could have put more videos on this DVD, especially a couple more from the ""Exit Stage Left"" tour. It's not an awful DVD, but it could have been a little bit better."
3,Um...Ok.,"I learned a valuable lesson after buying this DVD... Rush make [...] videos! Now, don't get me wrong... their music is AWESOME and I'm actually a huge fan... but how many times do I really want to sit through all their low budget and usually uninteresting music videos...?!?!? Most of them are just painfully cheesy and uninteresting...Admittedly the best parts of the DVD collection are really at the beginning with their early songs when RUSH just used performance and studio footage for their videos... I wish they would have followed that path through the rest of their career...Be warned: It's a nice video for historical purposes, but not particularly artistic or entertaining."
3,"I just love Rush, but this could be better","OK, I know, it's Rush, you may say there's nothing else to say. But for me the only thing that made me happy seeing this video was the ""new"" Tom Sawyer version in the studio. I mean, what are they waiting for to produce something new, or to take old videos from previously albums and put all of them on a new one? 11 years after the last video release (and it's the same!), I can say that the quality of the band has nothing to do with the quality of the videos..."
3,"great concert, horrible sound",this was a big dissapointment the band is great the songs are great.Whoever is responsible for the sound recording should be fired!!! this would have easily been a 5 star dvd.Rush should re do this
3,"Hippie music: some charming, some inane","This album is charming in many places and equally inane and annoying in others. Heron and Williamson can write some enchanting, celtic flavored tunes. They can also write some of the dopiest, meaningless, pseudo-mystical lyrics around. There is the very lovely ""You get brighter""-perhaps the best song here (which is why I bought the album). Some songs, however, are little more than many, many musical phrases strung together. As a time capsule of an early era of incense and naive mysticism, this will do just fine (it was released in 1968). Dated, but still worth a few listenings."
5,Nader is a national treasure,"Ralph Nader is about the only person I can think of who will be interviewed by Sean Hannity one day, and Amy Goodman of Democracy Now! the next. I hear so many ""dittoheads"" on talk radio say that they voted for him in 2000 that it makes me wonder if maybe some votes of conservatives disappeared down some Diebold rabbit hole.I didn't realize that Nader was the force behind the auctioning of seats when airplanes are overbooked. And his efforts to make cars safer here, made cars safer all over the world as foreign producers had to increase their standards to enter our market. So, Nader isn't just a national treasure, but an international hero.I just started the book, and it will be helpful in figuring out how to be a better public citizen myself."
3,Nader with his arms tied behind his back.,"This was a pretty good read, however somewhat dissapointing. It is standard arguments against the party duopoly. However, Nader does not stick it to the Democrats enough. They are a big part of the problem as well, and I feel that he may be holding back because of the complaints coming from that side.If Nader gave it to eveyone equally it would make for a much better book. Being that this is my first real experience with Nader's work I wished I would get more. However, it does serve to demonstrate most of his major arguments and criticisms regarding our corporate government."
1,Zero Stars,"I just saw Al Gore give a truly remarkable and inspiring talk on the realities of Global Warming, and couldn't help thinking what a great, green (though not Green Party) President he would've been.So, I re-read sections of this book to see if I could yet understand Nader's rationale for running in two super-tight (537-votes in 2000) presidential races, knowing he'd likely hand the election to GW Bush. And, once again, I can't see it.How cool would it have been if Nader had joined Gore (or Kerry) in return for a top post at the EPA, Agriculture, or other consumer-related federal post? Then, he'd really be making progress.As it stands, the world is going in the exact opposite direction of Nader's proclaimed platform, and his book doesn't make a strong argument for running. Not to mention, the rambling semi-coherent nature of this book makes it a tedious read.This book is conceptually and stylistically flawed."
2,It is not microwave safe,"One of the plate I bought broken during a 50 seconds medium heat microwaving, so I doubt it is really good for microwave. When I called Lenox, their rep. simply asked if I want to order a replacement from them as if the bad quality was not their problem. Disguesting.The design pattern was nice though."
4,The second in the series is a winner,This is the second in the series by Eloisa James and just as good as the first. This story picks up with Sophie and hunt for a man she can trust. The one she thinks she can trust may not be the one that is ment for her.With this book just as with all of Mrs. James other novels you need to set aside some time to be able to read it all in one setting. It gets to hard to put them down. You want to see if Sophie gets what she really needs and desires....Well written sensual book with a bit of light hearted fun along with a tragedy that brings them together.
3,3.5 Stars - Good Read,"I am pleased to see that this writer has begun to fulfill the promise exhibited in her first novel, Potent Pleasures. With a little more practice, she has the talent to become an excellent romance writer, rather than a merely good one. This second novel continues with the characters from the first book, and it is always fun to see the character development from novel to novel. I would agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending needs a little more oomph, but this is a well-told and well written story, and I would recommend it."
2,Book just didn't get going for me,"I'm going to make this short and sweet...I just couldn't get into this book. The various misunderstandings were ridiculous and in the end I lost interest. However, I adore Eloisa James and heartedly recommend her other books."
2,Plot depends on silly misunderstandings,"The title just about sums it up. And on top of that, too much focus on bedroom scenes - though this could be just personal taste."
3,Ok,"flirtatious doesn't equal confident. I like my heroines natuarally confident, Sophie has to wear dresses with necklines down to her nipples to build her confidence, that's not appealing to me in a heroine. Other than that the book was fine."
3,Just Okay,"I read Potent Pleasures and just loved it and couldn't wait to get my hands on the others in this series. This one was a huge dissappoint. The characters are completely ridiculos and YES, there are hardly any steamy scenes in this! The next in the series is much better as are the rest of her later books. I think she was getting her barings with this one and really missed a step. Honestly, this was just okay. Skip it and read everything esle of hers."
3,Sweet...Fast Read....I'd Give it 3 1/2 Stars,"These characters are well-developed and it's pretty much a good plot....but the whole Turkish adventure was kind of dropped and the extent of their misunderstandings weren't believable considering the intelligence level of the parties involved....I think the main problem was the book was overly long because the issues should have been resolved far earlier than they were.....I don't know, I really liked these people and just expected them to be a little smarter in their communications since they were so responsive physically. Bottom line, enjoyable and well-written romantic fluff...but overly long for what it was."
4,PLEASURE ON THE HIGH SEAS!!!!,"For the first few chapters I was bored. I had the distinct impression that the author was trying to show off to her readers that her knowledge of history and language was quite extent. I am glad that I decided to continue to read it for I ended up loving the book. If you have not read it yet, then my advice would be to not give up on it. Trust me, it is worth reading!"
2,Really Disappointed!,"At the beginning of the summer I read Potent Pleasures, I really love it!When I learned of ""Midnight Pleasures"" was coming out,I One-Clicked and waited for it to come. When I finally got a chance to read it I was disappointed. The charm that made ""Potent Pleasures"" so great was missing in this book. I really didn't care for either Sophie or Patrick. The plot just just didn't move me. It an okay book, but Ms. James' first book was better."
3,Pleasant interlude,"I almost did not buy this book because I was so disappointed with ""Potent Pleasures"". I am happy to say that this is a better book and worth the price. ""Midnight Pleasures"" was a good read for a rainy afternoon.The conflict between the main characters was well-written, and the plot did not drag. The primary fault I found with Ms. James earlier novel was the irrational behavior of the hero. The hero's behavior in this case had a documented reason (which the reader knows but of course the heroine does not), and was not as dramatic or unreasonable. There may be the minor inconsistancies that so irritated other readers in ""PP"" but nothing that was glaring, I thought.All in all, not a bad read."
1,Why did this book get such high ratings???????,"This could have been a good story. However, there was just too much unnecessary writing. No detailed, very boring, and short sex scenes.OMG! The sex scenes were horrible. Too many characters in the story. Too many boring plots all in one story. It started out pretty good. But once the heroine and hero got married (which by the way happens too early in the story) It just got so boring. Lady Sophie (heroine) starts out as this vivacious and flirtatious character....then suddenly becomes a gloomy, cowardly mute. I mean the author really destroyed the personality of her character. Because I really liked her in the series book before this one which is Potent Pleasures which was a whole lot better than this book? I like Patrick's character in the beginning of the story. But he becomes boring as well. This was so bad I dodn't want to finish the series."
3,"OK Read, More than I expected","This was a very good, lite read. I didn't expect too much from it, but it was more than I expected considering all that was written about of her first book. I read it all in one day. I would read the next book in the series, because I was intrigued by Quill in this book."
3,tripod stool,The stool itself is alright but on the long run if used often the rubber in the stool legs will wear out and break
4,Awesome,"These ""down-unders"" are really bringing forth the most awesome worship songs. ""How I long for You"" is worth the purchase. It is a refreshing CD both with the lyrics and the music. Honest, intimate expression of worship that you'll probably wear your CD player out with."
5,Nice upgrade,These worked great. It's funny to see peoples reaction when they are not expecting the rumble. No paperwork in the box but found the hook up info online.
4,Aura AST-2B-4 Pro Bass Shaker Pair,After reading quite a few reviews on this item I decided to get a set I remember a Porsche boxster had alpine versions of these fitted from the factory a few years back and thought for a convertible it has a good bass responseyears later and trying to get some bass out of the alpine 305 head-unit and Rockford fosgate amp but there is no where to put any subs in the XJR without sacrificing space and I don't want to sacrifice anything once they are installed Ill do a further follow up
4,does the job,"I made a video soundtrack for my thesis project that had some extremely low frequencies. Short of renting a professional grade audio system, this bass shaker was the cheapest and best solution for replicating the sounds in a gallery. I combined it with a 4ohm switchable stereo receiver I got for $40 from goodwill and attached the shaker to the underside of a gallery bench. I loved the results and got a lot of good feedback."
4,excellent bang (bass-shake) for the buck,"I bought both this Aura Pro bass shaker as well as the Buttkicker gamerButtKicker BK-GR Gamerbass shaker at the same time. I actually used the Buttkicker amp to temporarily power the Aura Pro, with good effect.The Aura Pro does not shake quite as forcefully as a Buttkicker, but it does an excellent job for the money.I think it actually does a better job than the Butttkicker with music, greatly enhancing the ""feel"" of lowbass when used with a decent subwoofer. Just a hint of extra rumble, adjusted so that the bass shaker does not call attention to itself as a separate entity, greatly enhances the music.For movies and videogames it does a pretty good job as well.I simply used four screws to attach it to the lower center back portion of my couches wooden frame.Then attach speaker wire to it just like you would any speaker (preferably from a subwoofer amp and the subwoofer output from your receiver) , and you are set, on the cheap."
1,Not powerful enough.,"I tried hooking it to a 75w sub-woofer amplifier and all it did was slightly vibrate and make a little noise. However, they are accepting it as a return, so I do look forward to doing business with them in the future."
2,These don't work we'll,"I got the audio source amp 100 that puts 75w per channel @ 4ohms to go with it but but the 2 bass shakers I got will not rattle my teeth at all at max volume, at least in my set up they don't. One of the reviews stated that at around 15w the bass shakers rattled his teeth, that was not my case.I would not buy these again"
1,bass shaker,Aura bass shaker Didn't work at all did nothing not a shake or sound!Would not recommend to anyone ! Sent back waist of money
5,"My favorite fragrance, don't know what I will do if it's discontinued!","I have used Pure Turquoise since it was first introduced. At that time I could buy inat most upscale department stores. Then it became scarce so now I have to order it online.I was surprised that very few of the perfume specialty websites stock it. Thanks Amazon,I am ordering the biggest bottle available on here. Please Ralph Lauren, do not discontinuethis wonderful fragrance. It's perfect whether wearing jeans or a little black dress."
1,Old and Turned,I ordered this for my wife for Christmas based on the good reviews. She was so excited until she sprayed it on her wrist only to find it had turned and smelled awful. I am trying to return the item but the seller is giving me the run around. Product and customer service terrible. Buy this product with caution!
1,Very sad...,"...to find out that the perfume I bought for Mom for Christmas was OLD.She is in the hospital and will be receiving hospice care, I finally found this perfume (her favorite) here and had it shipped. While visiting for an early Mother's Day surprise, found the perfume.It's old! It's yellowed, and even smells old, not like the original. She didn't have the heart to tell me as she knew I'd looked for it for so long.So sad."
4,Rouge Banjo,Great starter banjo for the price. No complaints. The banjo sounds good and plays well. Would suggest this instrument to another person.
5,Video cabinet,This cabinet is very nice. I bought it as a gift for my mother and she really liked it. I would definitely recommend it.
1,Some assembly required? Please.,"Lock it up? Right. When this package arrives in the mail, you'll get a box full of pieces and screws. Nothing in this manufacturer's description even remotely implies that you'll need a carpenter with a power screwdriver to put this ""storage cabinet"" together. ""Some assembly required."" Please. Get ready for a full day's project of sorting out packs of screws, pieces of wood, locks, latches, brackets, shelves. I'd rather pay return shipping than spend another minute sorting through this rubble."
4,"Nice, but not really warm white color light.",This set consists of 3 Hera Eco-LEDs puck lights and a transformer. Its all plastic painted in a stainless steel color. It emits a nice pure white color (3200K). The warm white description is misleading. Its warm in comparison to the common bluish LEDs. I was hoping for a more warm yellow incandescent color. This set is super energy efficient. I measured watts with a kill-a-watt watt meter at 5 watts. Each puck contains one super bright LED. The super bright description is relative to other LEDs that I have seen. This set is good for cabinet accent lighting.
5,Statler brothers new testament,"Bought this from the Statlers website when it was supposedly no longer in production. Got the Old Testament and New.Lots of good, country gospel telling stories vs. just gospel msuic."
3,Discs are flawed.,The discs skip or break with use in the songs; it varies each time they are played. That is the only problems.
5,GREAT MUSIC,My wife and I love this album. If I could find more at a reasonable price:I would buy them for gifts.
4,Good Book;Too much Ad Lib,"Aaliyah:More Than a Woman is a good book. The book describes Aaliyah's personal and public life; how she was ,who she was,and the people's lives she touched worldwide. The only problem I had with the book is how the author,Christopher John Farley, commented on the lives of other artists and not put his primary focus on Aaliyah. Much of the book contains the rise and fall of other artists of whom Aaliyah had met or come in contact with. The main chapter I was disappionted in was ""Damon and Aaliyah:A love story. That chapter didn't state anything about Aaliyah's relationship with Damon. In the beginning it started off with how they met and who Damon was and that was the end. The rest of the chapter the author just drifted off to another topic like much of the book.Overall, the book was still a good read. For all the devoted Aaliyah fans I would recommend this book because it gives you a deeper look to who Aaliyah was off camera as well as on."
3,Okay Biography,"I had high hopes for this book, but when I finished reading it i was dissapointed. The book told all about Aaliyah, her early life, accomplishments in music and movies, her love life, and her death. The material on Aaliyah's life was the only good part of the book, because the book kept on going off-topic to discuss lives of Aaliyah's family members, producers, fellow musicians and singers, and other people Aaliyah was involved with. This got very annoying for me, because I wanted to read about Aaliyah, not her cousins or music producers. The book could have been better researched in my opinion, and I wish it focused on Aaliyah's life only."
5,Wonderful book!,"The book ""Aaliyah"" is so good. I cried because it was so sad for a young person like her to die so soon when everything was going great for her. I recommend people to get this book!"
4,Fast Reading,"I read this book in 2 days. I am a huge Aaliyah fan, was very upset when she was killed. She was a beautiful young lady & now she is a beautiful spirit. The book was good, it touched on things most of her true fans had already known about her. The pictures were cool too. I like the fact that the author was truthful and didn't add things that were not known about her. I suggest every fan read it and if you would just like to know about the original hip-hop princess, read it.... They say they have a new hip-hop princess (Ashanti), but they are not saying that she is replacing Aaliyah, noone will ever be able to do that!"
3,It was Ok,"The book was okay but I did not like the author's style. It seemed like he was more intrested with other people more than Aaliyah. Aaliyah was an angel and desrves to have the whole book to herslf, or at least most of it. Not half of it to D Angelo or to Gladys Knight or to Kurt Cobain. I think it would have been much much better if he didnt keep on going on and on about other people and focused more on Aaliyah. It got to the point that I could turn to the next 5 or 6 pages and he would still be talking about someone else (not Aaliyah). Overall, I thought the book was alright, but the author needs to focus more on who's on the cover more than anyone else."
2,Aaliyah,"I thought this book helped me to remember the type of person Aaliyah really was, but the book really didn't give new insights on how she lived her life. It was just the same old story that MTV, ETV, and VH1 were telling. But I do like hearing what the other stars have to say about the death of Aaliyah. I wish the book had been more specific about the day that she died. Fans such as myself already realize how good of a person she was, I just wish people who really weren't into her music to know and come to understand why everyone was deeply hurt to hear that she died. The way the book was written, you might as well have had one of the fans write it. Maybe one of us could have told the story better."
5,"Aaliyah wasn't one in a million, she was the one and only!","First off I want to say that I know the devastation that's being felt right now with the loss of Aaliyah. As a music inspiration, Aaliyah showed the world what she had to offer. Her music, her talent, HER SOUL. She was a truly beautiful woman.This book was a great griefing method for me to accept what happend. It was written very insightfully. It talked about her career in both acting and music, her family, friends, and fans, and just the way Aaliyah touched us on this earth.Easily said, this book was just what an Aaliyah fan would like. As one myself, the book touched me deeply. Aaliyah's spirit and soul will live on forever. God Bless!"
2,Please don't waste your time or money,"Okay,I am a Aalyiah fan, and I am a person who loves to read. So when this book came out I ran to get it. I would not recommend this book to anyone who has cable or internet access. The information in this book was stuff that I could see on E's true hollywood story or VH1's behind the music or visiting a website. This book did not offer anything we already didn't know about Aaliyah. So if you have cable or internet, don't get it. It was rushed and hurried. I think the person who wrote the book was looking for a quick dollar. If a book is going to come out, it should be written or influenced by those who KNEW her."
3,"Short, but Sweet","Produced mainly for the adolescent market, ""Aaliyah: More Than a Woman"" by Christopher John Farley is a good biography on the life of the R&B; singer who was tragically taken away in August 2001. As a paperback book, this book will make a great read during a trip or at the school library, however since it was released so quickly to the market shortly after her death, the book lacks the qualities you'll find in a longer, well-researched biography. It would have been much more enjoyable to read if Aaliyah's family and closest friends provided the author with anecdotes and/or memories about Aaliyah that would have made this biography feel more personal.While it falls short on content, ""Aaliyah: More Than a Woman"" is a good read for those who know little or nothing about this amazing young lady. If you're an avid Aaliyah fan, I would wait until there is a hardbound biography produced in collaboration with Aaliyah's family."
5,Aaliyah,"I have a copy of this book already, but, i wanted to purchase another copy to replace the older one that I already have. :) It's a great story about a star that was just beginning to shine, but, was burned out by an unthinkable tragedy. :-( But, above all, I love the book and I love and miss Aaliyah very much."
5,More than a Woman *,Aaliyah(More than a Woman) is like no other it was the best. The book told everything about her life. It told everything she accomplished and more. Her life was interesting she was what you would call a lady and a family oriented girl who never forgot who she really was and where she came from. She was truly a angel and thats why people respect her all over the world. She was amazing and I would suggest anyone was into her and her music and acting talents read this book!
1,Not for die hard Aaliyah fans,"As a die hard Aaliyah fan, this book is just the facts page on an Aaliyah fansite. There could have been much more substance to it, there were a few small facts that I didn't know, like her hotel room alias was Vanessa Lake or something like that. But with the title,More Than A Woman, I expected to read more about the people person she was. Like the fan encounters and her march towards the the top of the entertainment world. It's just not worth the 7 bux to me, go to an Aaliyah fansite instead, cause that's all it is."
3,AALIYAH MORE THAN A WOMAN,"I LOVE THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A WHOLE BOOK ON AALIYAH, BUT WHEN I READ IT I WAS DISAPPOINTED. THE AUTHOR TALKED OFF FOCUS ON AND ON ABOUT OTHER MUSICIANS. I THINK THIS BOOK WAS ABOUT MUSIC IN GENERAL, WITH A LITTLE SECTION IN THE BACK ABOUT AALIYAH. AALIYAH IS BEAUTIFUL!"
3,A descent cd,"This is a descent cd and comes close to the real themes, but it isn't that bad. It has songs from WWF, WCW, and ECW. Not too many cds have all three companies on one cd."
2,Not what I expected...,I wanted oil to seal my cutting boards; this product is for furniture.It has a strong odor and is not made for cooking surfaces.Good for furniture only.
3,not so great quality,My friends complained about the sounds quality of the product. It broke recently after I used it for about a year.
5,A good strategy for 2001 and after,"Owning property or a business outside the U.S. could become a private alternative to storing wealth in a foreign bank or securities account that has to be reported to the IRS. New regulations effective on January 1, 2001 require foreign banks to report U.S. securities owned by American clients."
5,Tax free areas only,"What I really like about this book is its deliberate limitation to tax-free areas or special tax holidays (such as 10 years no-tax for opening a small hotel or guesthouse) instead of being just another book on moving abroad. This lets you improve your income dramatically, by choosing to build a business in a place where your money is automatically worth twice as much because you don't have to pay income taxes - and that is a huge portion of the world. Overtaxed Americans and other nationalities can gain much from the advice and opportunities in this book."
1,Don't waste your money!,"Wow, what a piece of garbage! I read the reviews on this page and thought I made a good choice. Not! I sent it back to Amazon.com, after reviewing it for 20 minutes. This book doesn't tell you why or how to, it gives you lousy information that can easily be found through public sources. I've found ""the offshore money book"" by Arnold Cornez to be much more valuable..."
2,Not of much use for the ICW,"I bought this thinking I might learn some thing about navigating the ICW. If that is your interest, you are better off buying a book on cruising the ICW. I am not saying the book is wrong on any point, it is just not helpfull, as it contains only a bit of useful information."
3,No choice here...must read!,"Rules or the ""road"" - so many questions can be answered in these pages...just boring to read but...you need this book,"
4,Rules from the Coast Guard,"Very technical. It would be better if there were lots of examples., This book is required on larger boats, I bought it to cover with my students in a USPS class."
4,Every seaman must have,"If you are a seaman you have to possess it, read it, and understand it. Period. The price on Amazon was much cheaper than my local stores."
2,USCG Navigation Rules,The publication is REQUIRED to be onboard vessels over 39 feet. Not much choice in the matter.
1,Lights and Sounds - Not Much More!,"New to boating, I wanted some help with proper use (i.e., navigation) for my boat. No help. Just lots of lights and signals. Nothing on courtesy, which side of markers, how to read channel markers, etc. A waste of money."
1,Not big enough to justify price.,"I bought this as part of a baby shower gift. I expected something larger. Instead I got a tiny little sampler pack that fits in the palm of my hand, specifically this thing is only 5.5 x 4 inches.Also, mine arrived in bad shape, the package had broken and was repaired sloppily with packing tape. Not an attractive looking package to give as part of a gift.I paid $12.39, and THANK GOODNESS I did not have to also pay shipping for my order. If I had another few dollars tacked on for shipping I would really be irate.I advise not to buy this. Probably, would end up cheaper for you to just go out and buy a couple full sized products. I guess the only use for these are for using when one travels. They are that small."
4,Little but great product,I'm a huge fan of Burt's Bees products and these are no exception. The oil is especially great for newborns during the winter.
5,Burts Bees is the best!,"I love these ""Baby Bee"" products, and this set is the perfect add-on gift for a baby shower..."
1,WORST STROLLER EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the worst stroller ever, this thing takes up the whole back of my Grand Jeep Cherokee. It is heavy, I think it is 50 pounds, can't go anywhere with this, the back tires are very far apart making it very wide, I always need help when I get stuck in aisles in stores, getting in and out of doors. It is way to long, longer than all the other tandem strollers. The front foot rest is up to high, so my 19 month old son's ankles hit the foot rest(it is not ajustable) can't get stuff in or out of the basket easily, you have to unsnap it. The shade in the back gets ruined and doesn't stay up because of folding it up. I had the eddie bauer single and decided since I had the car seat for my new baby already to fit this, I would save money. I am buying another tandem after she is out of the carseat, so what a waste of money. DO NOT BUY THIS STROLLER, IF YOU WANT TO GO ANYWHERE!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Disappointed in size.,We have had a George Foreman for years. When our last one stopped working we ordered the new one with the removable plates. The grill is great just thought it would be bigger. The last one we had you could cook 4 chicken breast this one only two.
4,Great Indoor Grill,"We love this grill and use it all the time - the interchangeable plates are easy to remove and clean. We have not been too successful with making waffles. The first attempt was great, but ever since then, we have had an issue with them sticking to the plates."
2,Uneven heating - don't buy this if you are buying it for waffles...,"We bought the G5 unit mainly as a nice _big_ waffle maker with removable andwashable plates (we have a propane grill, so grilling isn't important).The problem is that it does not cook waffles evenly. If you fill the grids, thecenters start to burn while the edges are still raw. If you don't fill the grids(i.e. limit the batter to what's directly over the heating element) it worksOK but you end up with evenly done, but half-size, irregular-edged waffles.If you are buying this as a grill, ignore our issues; they probably don'tmatter unless you need big waffles.We returned the unit"
5,A great grill,"We have used several different counter top grills, including other Foreman grills. This one is our favorite. The interchangable plates are great. It makes great waffles!"
3,liked,Why cant you just click the number of stars and be done? Most of time I do not want to go into detail.
1,Disappointed,I was pretty disappointed in this product. I got it for Christmas and was going to return it because I already had the regular Foreman. I should have stuck with it. Have the removeable plates dont work well with the what you would put in it due to the slant. I did not like the egg omlette one the griddle is bad also. The only thing worth keeping it for is the meat and in that case you might as well save yourself some cash and get the regular Foreman. This one is not worth the money.
4,G5 Multi Removable Plate Grill,"Before I purchased the G5 I had a smaller Geroge Forman that was probably one of the first ones sold. I did not like that I could not remove the grills. The G5 grills are super easy to romove so I really like that. The one thing I do not like is the upper ""Steak Plate"" ridges slant in several directions and that makes it a little harder to clean than the lower ""Grill Plate."" I would like it if both plates had the same ridges. I like havinig different temperature settings. Everything cooks very quickly. I used the ""Bake Plate"" for heating up a left over tostada and it worked great! It was like having a small oven. Overall I think this is a great appliance."
5,easy way to cook,"I'm not into cooking, especially since it is typically dinner for one. This guy is my hero. I don't have to heat up the oven in the summer, go outside in the snow to grill steaks, etc... It also lets me impress people when I make waffles or the perfectly shaped omlets (I bought the extra plate for those). It is easy to clean with the non-stick surface. I can either wash the removable plates or plop them into the dishwasher."
4,I love my new George Foreman Grill,"I really love my new George Foreman Grill. It is so convenient now to fix quick meals. It cooks pork chops, steaks, sausage, bacon, most anything quickly and thoroughly. I love how easy it is to clean the plates. They are so easy to remove, put in the dishwasher, or suds down right away. Just let soak for a few minutes or put soap water on the grill while it is hot. One thing I have found that is important, though, is to always, always, always use some type of oil spray before cooking anything. I forgot to tell my daughter this and she cooked something and when I went to clean the plate, it nicked just a bit. Prespraying saves the tephlon. I don't care what the manufacturer says. Also, cook your meat at high temperature. It keeps the meat juicy. Grill cheese sandwiches are delicious. I have not used it for waffles yet. All in all, I would not do without it. This product sits on my counter ready to use because I use it all the time."
3,Review George Forman Grill,The only problem I have with the grill is the waffle iron grids don't fit very well. They are loose and tend to fall out. I like the grill for cooking meat but otherwise it is not what I expected.
5,excellent,"this grill is greatit gets rid if all the nasty stuff and makes amazing grilled cheese,quesadillas,and many other things without soaking them in butter bc its nonstick so u dont need it!its soo quick and handy and one of the greatest ways to spend some money"
5,George Foreman Grill,I gave the Gearge Foreman Grill to my daughter-inlaw for Christmas; she said she absolutely loves it. This was said after she used it several times
2,non intuitive and confusing,"The program is powerful, but the interface is very confusing. I've been struggling with it all day now, and i still can't get it to behave predictably. Figuring out where drawing elements are going to end up (in 3D mode) is very, very tricky. I've been through the tutorials, but i'm still deeply in trial and error mode. Frustrating.You have to keep telling it to redraw the images, otherwise you wind up with leftovers on the drawing surface.BTW, i've been a professional software developer for almost 20 years (DOS, UNIX, Windows, Pocket PC) and i'm an electrical engineer -- not a novice at this stuff!"
4,many uses,the software was very useful and gave me ease in using it and creating many different drawings and sketches.
4,the pirate's booty,"Wow , Blackbeard's back and just as scary as he was the first time around .His self-determination may include kidnapping and teen-rape for starters , but that's only the tip of his iceberg....and what a deadly iceberg it is that lurks below the surface of the historic and beautiful waters of Eastern North Carolina .Danny Ferguson weaves the past with the politically power-filled present to give his readers a sense of how much power can manipulate .I'm waiting for the sequel, and keeping my light on at night and the doors all securely locked ."
4,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book very much. Not meant to be comprehensive, it gives a lot of information about the best beers in the world. It also rates pricing,availability and durability...something very unusual in a book like this. His quick guide gives you an instant pair up with foods and a lookup by characteristics. The visuals are spectacular and make you thirsty just by looking at them. A must-have for geeks and newbies alike."
4,Altons Angle knives,"I recieved the bamboo 3 knife box set a few years ago I love them! But I noticed one of my knives with a bit of rust and notches over time, of which I have never seen in any of my knives before.I find them really easy to use and am looking forward to purchasing a larger knife like the 6"" ChefDragona"
2,I feel like i was tricked,"I donot allow people to walk with shoes on in my home,i ordered these for the shoe basket next to my door for guest who wish to keep their shoes on .the problem is that i thought the 12pr-ment 12 pair of shoe covers ,no its one and they are huge looks to be about a mens size 10 n larger shoe covers,oh well for a little over 3bucks i will keep but wanted to note this for potential buyers!!"
5,painless and quick,When I ordered this item I was worried it might not work or it might be the wrong item. with all the letters in the item code. but it was spot on. extremly easy to install just plug it in the docking station and off you go. no cables no screws no hasstle. it been working like a dream.I recommend it to anyone with a VAIO docking station.
5,Comments of the book,It was an excellent conditions and price is pretty good I loved the quality of that kind of book thanks
2,Not a very good album... sorry.,"If you are a Die Hard Fairport fan then you probabily already own this album. At this stage in this groups evolution, they are unsure in what direction they want to go, pulling in three different musical directions. Not the excellence of Leige & Lief to later follow. Tho, Dennys voice is strong in 'Fotheringay' & 'Nottamun town' and a very good rendition of Bob Dylans 'I'll keep it with mine' is still not good enough to pull is album out of the dumpster, and for $20 + bucks one would expect more..... Sorry."
1,Don't be taken in by rip-off artists!,"Let me start by saying that my review is in NO WAY a reflection of the music on here. Everything on this CD is great, and I love it.But people are charging insanely high prices for something Wendy Dio is reissuing and remastering later this year or earlier next year. Just wait a few months, and it will be readily available again. Don't give these rip-off artists a dime."
4,"Long live ""Stars""","Granted the lyrics are not shakespeare, and the five minute guitar solo may seem excessive, but the song ""Stars"" still reminds me why I fell in love with classic metal.The vocals are great, the solos are super rockin', and face it, this song at the time(compared to ""we are the world"" and the ""band aid$Q[Is this the song name?])is like comparing Slayer to Michael Jackson. I would give the song 5 stars if the lyrics were just a smidge better(it receives 4 stars for quality, but 5 stars for emotional attachment from when I was 11), and the album receives 3 stars as a whole(the contributing artists could have put out original songs, or unrecorded b-sides, instead of rushed live recordings of the songs besides Stars. All in all I feel as if I'm back in 85, before Poison and Warrant made metal a joke, when I listen to this album."
3,OK for the first clanbook,"Considering that this was the first clanbook White Wolf published, it's pretty good. Its strongest features are the non-sterotypical character templates, and its explaination of the three Brujah factions.It could use more information on the history and leaders of the clan, and the secret powers could have been edited out.Overall all it's good for players who want to play Brujah as more than bullies."
3,An adequate update,"While this newest clanbook makes a good attempt at explaining how this clan can attempt to hold power in the world of darkness, ultimately it fails at really making a case on how a clan so lacking in planners or diplomats can hold its own against more unified, well liked clans. Yes, individually, they may be more physically powerful then other clans. But the ""V:tM"" game has already established how little this matters on the grand scale of things. More illustration of Brujah 'long term' thinking should have been presented. Sadly, this clan is still portrayed as the shortest term thinkers of all the clans, and therefore the least formidable. Despite this, an entertaining read and an adequate update."
4,Very interesting,"While I had disliked the idea of Brujah characters usually, and though I may have bought this clanbook against my better judgement I was surprised. The Brujah have a history all their own and I especially thought it was interesting of how the American and European Brujah differ and why. Once again- in immersing myself in the fantastical world of VTM which is ingeniously interwoven into actual history, I learn more of the progress and history of the world than I ever did in school."
4,Wish they would have put everything on one disc,Recieved UFC: Best Of 2008 from Amazon. Kind of strange how they decided to include 2 25GB discs instead of putting everything on a 1 50GB disc.The picture quality is pretty good.The content is:Disc 1 (21.1GB)Penn Vs StevensonPenn Vs SherkSt-Pierre Vs SerraAnderson Silva ProfileJardine Vs SilvaFight For The Troops PromoEvan Tanner TributeMir Vs LesnarCouture Vs LesnarMir Vs NogueiraDisc 2 (23.4 GB)Jackson Vs GriffinJackson Vs SilvaUltimate Fighter PromoLiddell Vs EvansGriffin Vs EvansBonusUltimate Comebacks TrailerTop 5 Knockouts Of 2008Top 5 Submissions Of 2008UFC Behind The Scenes (33 minutes)
5,Great UFC blu-ray title,"To the previous reviewer who wanted to know what the ""packages"" are, they are basically clips/promos. For example, the Evan Tanner package is probably like 3 minutes of an Evan Tanner tribute. The fight for the troops package is just a 3 minute promo/summary of that event.I just watched this today. I always order UFC PPV events in HD and this blu-ray is certainly better quality. This is a must for any UFC/MMA fan."
4,"Great Pix, should have included more fights","Amazing picture in Blu Ray. All fights featured were shot in HD. Box says 1080I. I believe Blu Ray player upscales to 1080P. Definetely a notch above the PPV HD broadcasts.As others stated, there should have been more complete fights included on each disk since since Blu Ray discs support 50 Gigs of data. I would have liked to have seen Hendo/Anderson, Machida/Tito, and Lesnar/Herring complete fights. Also, a few of the e Fight for the Troops main card.UFC should include some easter eggs in their DVDs. If your a UFC/MMA fan this is required buying at the current cheap price for a Blu Ray."
1,better,I like using[..] to look for jobs... with websites like this you don't need this book. Helpdeskcrossing just has jobs from employers websites and it's got a lot more listing than a lot of the other job search websites or job boards. It's really cool and easy to use and a lot faster than reading a whole book or registering through one of those places that helps find jobs for you...
5,Another excellent cd set.,"My wife and I have not found a bad cd by this artist, yet. He is such a pleasure to listen to. The only thing better is his DVDs. Hopefully he will be making more."
5,Beautiful,"There are three songs I don't remeber hearing before. I thoroughly enjoy this album. I especially enjoy the way Daniel sings LOVE ME TENDER, SMOOTH SAILIN', and HELLO DARLIN'.Whatever Daniel sings is beautiful!!!!!!"
3,It's fine if you don't need sound or a parallel port,"I bought this for use in the office. The unit is hearty and well constructed. It includes both an analog video port and a DVI port, 4 usb ports, and gigabit networking.However, it does NOT include a jack for external speakers, microphone, firewire, or a parallel port. I can understand skipping the parallel port, but the other three boggle the mind. They're small and arguably very necessary in many circumstances.And it's not like they didn't have room for them on the back. Toshiba just decided not to include them. Unfortunately, if you own a Portege M400 like me, this port replicator is your only option.I was going to buy a second one for home, but decided not to since it doesn't have all the functionality I need."
3,Solid but could use some improvement,I am using this right now - everything is great except for two things.1. NO headphone jack so you can't use non USB speakers!2. The only other negative thing is that my computer wiggles a little to the right and left - it is not completely locked in. Too bad :(
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From an OBJECTIVE reviewer...critically WAY over rated, commercially perhaps underrated, but still forgettable sorta folk music."
2,Better than nothing,"I bought this map for a trip to Ecuador. There are several things I do not like about it. 1. It is made out of plastic rather than that super strong paper like material that I thought it was made from. I fear that repeated folding and refolding is going to break the plastic. 2. natural features are not indexed--rivers. 3. no longitudes or latitudes are shown (this absolutely blew my mind. I had never heard up printing a map without these. Makes the map useless to use with a GPS.)What I do like. 1. nice scale 1: 1,000,000. 2. well printed 3. roads are well shown."
5,Workhorse - never lets me down,I've owned this saw for over a year now and it is the main workhorse here on the farm. Love the button that releases pressure to help it start. Cranks on no more then 3 pulls and has done all I have asked of it. I use gas preservative and only Husky oil to mix with the gas and have no problems with this saw or my smaller Husky. Highly recommend this saw!!!
2,Beware of Muffler Bolts,"I have had this chain saw for a few years with only ocasional use (4 hours total). I always drain the gas between uses and it has started and worked reliably until today. About an hour into my work I heard an rattling sound and turned off the machine. One of the two bolts that secures the muffler had fallen off and the other was loose. I tried to use the saw with one bolt but it quickly loosened and I ended up stripping the threads on the engin block with all my tightening. I spent a few hours looking for a replacement bolt, but Husqvarna is not well suported with repair shops locally.My advise is make sure you have a local shop that repairs the saw that you buy."
5,dressage/eventer from the U.S.A,"This is a delightfull book about the good and bad times of Mary King and her horses. It is written from the heart and you will laugh and cry. Annie's views and stories are wonderfull. She deserves, and gets, alot of credit for being a top groom. A must read for any eventer."
4,Helpful book,I just started my Masters program and found this book helpful in my writing style. I found the book easy to reference material with and it made sense of things so that you could understand easily what the author was explaining. I recommend this book for all levels of education.
4,SUPRISINGLY GOOD!!!!!!,"a group of robbers on the run make the mistake of using an abandoned mansion as their hideout. Something terrible living inside the walls awaits them with a fate more frightening than the one they may find on the outside.DVD has audio commentary, deleted scenes(not worth a damn), and a making of featurette.has some pretty good gore and fairly descent acting for a ""B"" movie. definitely worth the 3.29 at blockbuster."
4,CIVIL WAR HORROR,"This movie was truly EERIE. There were a few parts I just didn't quite get like at the end when the last survivor got shot. When the soldiers went over to him, he was not human, but one of those weird looking things that seem to live in the cornfield. So what was that about? Did he become one of those things, but only appeared to look so to other people? There was one litte skip in the DVD, but no biggie."
4,"Shocked, very shocked..........","...... at how good this film was. I rented it because I didnt want to buy it considering it was , I guess you could say not a big budget film and for the price i was skeptical. But I rented and watched it and I extremely enjoyed it, just fantastic. A scary movie that was actually pretty scary. So I will go out and buy thgis because it is worth it to have IMO atleast , its movie I will watch multiple times. give it a rent first and see what you think most likely you wont be dissapointed."
1,Dead Birds,"Dead Birds should have been entitled, Dead Ducks! It wasn't the actors, it was the plot! Something (skinned dog manufactured out of spent gum?) attacks the 5 people heading for the old farm and they are forced to kill it before they even get close. Hmmmm, not too promising in my book! Nevertheless, the group continues to the old farm and spend lots of time wandering around the interior (neat old house!) There is also the subplot of the original owner who turned his children into little sneaky things with sharp teeth via cutting up his slaves. Of course, we don't really know why he did this or for what purpose. The kids only show up two or three times to scare someone and their moment of glory is so fast you have to stop frame them to get the full effect. In spite of the feelings of unrest and the fact that characters regularly walk out of the house and disappear, the group continues to stay. Personally, I would have kept walking on down the road after the gumby dog showed up; go figure!"
1,Worst Movie I've Recently Seen,"It boggles my mind how in other reviews this movie was praised. It was possibly the worst movie I've seen in quite some time. (Saying alot since I watch a ton of movies) The whole premise to me was ridiculous. Confederate soldiers after robbing a bank go to a haunted old mansion and systematically get picked off one by one. Besides the time period, the rest of the movie was completely unoriginal. It featured a creepy little boy a la The Grudge, a creepy little girl and a well a la The Ring, and a scarecrow a la Jeepers Creepers. The shooting of the movie was unique and featured wide angled, deep shots however it didn't really add anything to the movie. Overall I wouldn't waste your time."
2,Weak!,Boring the script was very dry it could have been so much more but it was complete crap if you want to see this movie rent it from redbox do NOT buy this movie.
4,Dead Birds,"From reading the premise of the film it sounds very good, and for the most part the film does deliver. The ending feels a bit rushed at times, as some characters kind of just disappear (literally), but I still found it to be pretty good. That is a huge welcome in the onslaught of all these terrible so-called `PG-13' horror films. Anyway, good price, good movie."
1,Horrible film from start to finish,"When I bought this movie, I at least hoped for good actors. Good actors will make any movie, however bad, worthwhile. Then after the first five minutes I started to hope for good cinematography. When neither of those hopes came true, I laid my last hope on a good story line with scary monsters. The cover at least promised that. Needless to say this movie was a bomb through and through. The actors are hams, the flow of the script is monotonous, and scary monsters were in very short supply. I want my two hours back."
4,What a suprise! This movie was very good!!!!!!,"I went into this flick not expecting much. Newer horror movies have been disappointing. It was a different story, and really kept my interest. My only complaint is the CG effects. I wish movies would quit relying solely on them. They really take you out of the moment."
2,Let Down,I bought this movie after reading how scary it was.Well if any of the pictures on the back of the movie case scare you then by all means watch it.
2,could have been masterpiece,"Wow a horror western. About time,, straight to video,, not sure,, result,,, Well this has a great evil feel, good on surround speakers. great cast, great filmed. Story? who wrote this a 4 yr old it made no sense and did not explain. Only japanese horror are supposed to do this. If you want to see a good atempt and maybee see what you can do and try it your self. Talk a friend into renting it and watch it. Never buy."
2,too slow,"Good luck staying awake through this one, and if you do manage to see any action in this, it is very generic, as well as the acting. Bring a pillow Zzzzzz. picture quality and sound are good, gave it an extra star for that"
2,Dead Boring........,"After hearing that this movie was a great horror movie, I decided to purchase it. Something I regret doing. First of all, the title does not make sense for this movie. It is set in the 1800's which made it boring for me right from the beginning. The movie is about a group of bank robbers who hide out in a abandoned house. It is more of a western type movie than horror movie. The only good part of the movie was when the ghostly images appear but their faces remind me of the rediculous face of the killer in the Scream movies. There are supposidly souls and spirits trapped in the home but don't get prepared to be scared. This is not a scary film. I don't recommend anyone buying it. If you are curious, just rent it and save yourself money!"
3,SOUTHERN SCARES,"DEAD BIRDS is one of those atmopsherically creepy indies that works due to its spooky undertones and an original plotline. A band of confederate soldiers rob a bank, kill everyone inside and even manage to kill a little boy on their escape. They seek refuge in a deserted plantation that was the site of some deadly black magic. ET's beloved Henry Thomas, all grown up, plays the robbers' mastermind, with support from a largely unknown cast of players. Director Alex Turner keeps the mood eerie and suspenseful, although there is a lot of wandering around with lanterns that tends to get tedious. But the movie's shock moments are potent and DEAD BIRDS manages to be a breath of fresh air in the straight to video market."
1,Are You All Serious???,"I'm a fan of all types of horror films, so my opinions regarding this movie are not based on dislike of the genre. 4.5 stars overall for this??? Folks have to be crazy. This movie went nowhere...slowly. It lacks plot,characterization, and the charm that makes even ""bad"" horror movies worthwhile.Fans of this movie just can't be fans of real horror flicks."
2,Just Plain Bad,"This movie was just plain bad. The setting and premise were great, but the script and execution pathetic. Typical 90 minute straight to video garbage!"
1,the worst Horror movie ever,"boring! And what is happening? Nothing. Tese people go into that house and the whole time they are looking in the rooms and searching around the house but nothing happens. Some people disappear, that`s all. Don`t buy it. Go for The (NEW) Hills have eyes or saw but forget about this one."
4,"Not too bad, but made in CHINA","I bought this from reading the highly rated reviews and thought that it would be nice to1) not use so much non-stick pans because of the chemicals that are on it.2) buy something Made in the USA.Unfortunately, these pans are now made in CHINA, because a another company bought out Doughmakers.Nevertheless, the pans seems pretty sturdy. I've only baked once in them (carrot cake) and with parchment paper lining the bottom, and some butter, the cake came out easily and cooked well. I look forward to seeing whether these pans are worth the price tag, and if they are as durable as the reviewers claim."
1,dude! Where's my house?,"This is a very thought provoking study as only the infamous Robert Wayne Kirmis could prepare. It's obvious he tapped his super-human power bands for a little extra gusto on this one! On my recommended A-List for anybody who is bored with there job and doesn't have anything better to do! (Or a good toilet wipe for the homeless!)peace, brother."
4,Good overview of underrated Canadian band,"Culled from their three albums with vocalist Buzz Shearman, Self-Destruction is a good way to check out the band's best work released in the latter half of the 1970s. You'll also be able to hear just how hard-livin' turned Shearman's clear vocal into a raspy echo. He was later replaced by future Loverboy singer Mike Reno for a fogettable album that, thankfully, isn't included here. Moxy without Shearman wasn't Moxy."
3,Apparently they were big in Texas...,"...but isn't EVERYTHING supposed to be big in Texas? Moxy were heavier than a lot of Canadian rock bands from this era, but didn't seem to have any outstanding songs to offer. You can imagine them being a good live band in their day, though"
5,Life's Characters,"Richard Bissell is a master of dialogue and character development. The story of one trip on a tow boat up the Mississippi unfolds almost as a back-drop, as conversations between characters reveal the lives of the boatmen and their perspectives on life.One of these marvelous perspectives, on growing older, was ""...there is such a short time between being scared and wondering how to purchase a ticket to Sioux City, and then all of a sudden knowing too much about tickets, trains, and especially Sioux City.""This is a wonderful book. If you are from the Midwest, you will appreciate the honest, uncomplicated, realistic way Bissell presents the people and places, without the sarcasm of Sinclair Lewis. And, no matter where you are from, you will recognize the character types and enjoy the subtle presentation of deeply thoughtful insight found in ""High Water."""
5,Insight into the Spirit World,"This is a fascinating look at a phenomenon which swept American society in the l9th century, involving many of its leading citizens. By focusing on the Fox sisters, the author offers an up close view of spiritualism and the period."
2,"Good info, poor book",I bought this book on a recommendation of a friend. It was super long-winded and not all that well written. It mentioned everyone who ever interacted with the sisters. I could not finish reading it. It got boring pretty quickly. Goes into the next garage sale.
5,This book will get your group talking!,"I have used this book to lead a discussion group. The group was mostly comprised of people who are in the process of investigating the claims of Christianity. It really got the group talking! Each of the sessions in the book raise questions that help everyone identify personally with the topic. It then helped our group to come to terms with what Jesus has to say about these very relevant issues that we all face in today's culture. It is well written, was well received, and easy to use. I believe it is a very effective tool to help people understand who Jesus is, and what he is saying to them about the world they live in. It makes those involved think about what their response should be to the issue, but most of all, it makes them think about what their response should be to Jesus, himself. I look forward to using this group discussion study guide again, as well as the other study guides in the Reality Check series!"
3,Great made for TV movie,"Courtney Thorne-Smith portrays the dairy princess from hell who'll do anything to gain the love and affections of local farmer Kyle Secor, even if it means eliminating her main rival, his plain Jane fiancee (played by Tracey Gold). Unfortunately his love for his fiance is more than she bargained for and he's a tough man to land.Based on a true story, Courtney is completely believable as the deadly beauty queen who is at one time earnest and eager to please and within seconds turns psychotic. It would be too easy to turn this role into something campy, but Courtney displays great restraint. You can occasionally find it playing on Lifetime or LMN, but at this price, it's worth the purchase."
3,A filmography more than a biography,"The book starts out with a detailed account of Mitch's childhood/early adulthood and sets up the reader to think it will continue as a biography. Instead, it is a highly detailed filmography, citing every detail of almost every film he made. It was interesting, but I felt cheated. I wanted to know more about his siblings, children, and wife. Server introduces all of them but doesn't elaborate. Only ""tidbits"" are given of Mitch's personal life (mostly concerning his public drunkeness; was there more to him than that?). It is truly a filmography. If its a look into who he really was you want, this won't deliver. (By the way, he didn't make the ""Apartment"" with Shirley Maclaine, that was Jack Lemmon)."
3,Too Much & Same Old Information!,"I enjoyed reading some of the ""behind the scenes gossip"" of the movies, television shows, etc. Robert Mitchum was part and parcel of. Some items, the drinking, farting, and womanizing, I could have done without. If only, because these same things were discussed, analyzed, etc. over and over again-same song, second verse!"
1,"Horrible, Absolutely Horrible","This is a terrible book. The author does a terrible job of making anything about Robert Mitchum's life seem interesting or worth reading. And whoever edited this book should immediately be fired. For instance, Eglin Air Force Base near Pensacola, FL is not spelled ""Egland"" - I know because I was born there. There are many other errors of this kind throughout the book (for instance when the author calls Mitchum's son ""Josh"" instead of ""Jim"") that totally detract from the readibility and smoothness and veracity of the book. And it's one boring page after another of movie details that have no releveance to Mitchum's life. Check it out from the library if you must read it but definitly DON""T BUY IT! Better yet, just go rent some of his movies - you'll see that Robert Mitchum truly was one of the greatest actors of all time."
3,LG CU500,"I recieved the LG CU500 about a month ago. It's a nice looking phone andI'm pleased with the strong signal I get in my area (S.W. Michigan).However, I am disappointed with the ringer. It goes from very soft to a very loud volume and sometimes I miss a call due to not hearing the phone til it gets loud. (VERY ANNOYING!!)I am considering returning the phone due to the ringer that is not adjustable. Otherwise, everything else is good."
5,Absurd!,"This soundtrack is good but, are you serious? $135? It's rare but it's not that rare. You can get one at a collectible shop for $15 (like I did). I am fairly confident the person that is either selling this or knows him/her is the one writing the above review. Don't get sucked in!"
4,Expanding one's view of Virginia Woolf,"Barrett brought together several of Woolf's writings and criticisms about women and writing. It's a fascinating collection that expands one's view of Virginia Woolf as a writer and as a thinking, highly intelligent woman. Her reviews of some of her contemporaries or such writers as Jane Austen, George Eliot, and the Bronts are thought-provoking and revealing about Woolf's inner life. Coupled with Barrett's insightful introduction, this book is a welcome addition to anyone's Woolf collection or to those interested in women as writers. It expands a bit on the notions presented in her famous ""A Room Of One's Own""."
4,First Incredibles,"A delightful album which showcases the emerging talents of songwriter/minstrels Mike Heron and Robin Williamson along with the (slightly) more conventional musical abilities of their friend and mentor Clive Palmer. Clive contributes the more traditional banjo and blues pieces while Robin and Mike drop fascinating hints about the diverse musical territories they were about to venture into. ""Womankind"" and especially ""October Song"" stand out as timeless classics but everything else is pretty fine. If this is a true reflection of the music to be heard regularly in Clive's Incredible Folk Club in the mid 1960's, it must have been an extraordinary time and place. The original Incredibles are now touring again after all these years, which makes this first album all the more fascinating."
1,Incredible String Band Self Titled Vinyl,I never received my item; The seller shipped it via FedEx with no signature required so they left in outside my apartment and I never got it so I assume it was stolen. :(
3,Vic Morrow tough guy,He plays an assasin who escaped from prison and fakes his death and has come back to have his revenge. For a 70's movie it is OK and since I grew up watching him I liked it. It is sometimes implausible but it moves fast enough to keep you interested.
5,The Wellness Encyclopedia of Food and Nutrition,"The book ""The Wellness Encyclopedia of Food and Nutrition"" that we ordered arrived in the condition the seller said it was in and was packaged well. My husband's parents have one of these books. My daughter really liked it and wanted one for herself. It has a lot of information in it that she wanted. It is a good book for people who are interested in eating and living healthy. We were happy to find one on Amazon for her. Thankyou for making it possible to find things like this on-line. :)"
5,Marvelous,"If you love Oscar, if you love Ray Brown, if you love Kern...this is your album! Nothing else to say...just marvelous."
1,Not a very useful reference.,"This book does not contain any information that is not easily available on the Web for free. Go to the AMCC or PLX web sites and read their documentation. They go into much more detail. This book is way to general to be of any real use. The diagrams are not explained in any more detail than is available in the PCI spec or the PCI Handbook. Finally, a few software examples would be very instructive. The included CD-ROM does not include examples, only the book in electronic form."
3,I have no idea how to use this.,I bought this for the nutritional benefits but so far my results have been failures. It's tasty but as with whole wheat flour I prefer the taste of regular flour.I finally made the teff peanut butter cookie recipe and they turned out like a flat crunchy cracker but I improved the second tray by adding marmalade and cinnamon for a surprisingly Chinese flavor.
4,"nice bridle, got several compliments but...",while I like the bridle I am not happy with the super grip reins. They are super grip but uncomfortable to hold.
1,Emachines complaint,"Emachines is a company that clearly considers their service department primarily as a secondary income stream. Emachine is a company, which demonstrates no intention of standing behind their products. I bought one of their laptops less than a year ago. Within less than six months I had problems with the power port. After another three months the power port burned up. By phone I asked to buy a replacement port from Emachine, they refused to provide it. They said they would only offer to repair it for 40% of the purchase price of a unit, which worked correctly for at the most six months. I simple want a power port replacement for my laptop, which has been inoperable for almost six months. Emachines is a company, which chooses to negligent it's obligation to support its product."
1,Underpowered,"First impression is important for anything, and mine with the M5305 is not positive at all. The unit arrived with two production defects, one more serious (three bad pixels on the screen) and one minor (media drive doesn't fit exactly). The performance is very bad... I've seen a Fujitsu running the same processor and it was fast, but not the M5305. The video performance is also terrible. The combo drive is noisy, making one feel uncomfortable using it on the road. Travel weight is a little over eight pounds, so it's heavy! And the styling is quite ugly, too. There's a reason why emachines chose the angle for the product shot on their website... and did you notice they have very little specs info? This is one under-equipped machine. The widescreen is pretty much useless in 99% of your computing day. In sumary, South Korean PC maker Emachines must do more to make decent and reliable products... much more."
5,Awesome,Product was easy to use and exactly as described I used it to make monkey faces for cake pops for my sons 1st birthday party so cute perfect color
3,"nice color selection, difficult to work with","the color selection was very nice in the box, however it was not easy to work with. it was very soft and i needed to add powdered sugar even when working with smaller quantities. i would try to use another brand in the future because of this."
2,a little disappointed,"I bought the product and the colours are beautiful and it arrived speedily, but boy are the packets small! Ok so the weight checks out. I just somehow imagined it to be a bit bigger. It's a bit pricey and I would think twice before purchasing it again."
1,I could never use a product this ignorant.,"Look at that cute cake on the box! It has people with white skin, and brown skin, and dark brown skin. Such a special diverse cake!! And look at the colors used; according to the box the colors are light brown, dark brown, pink (skin tone), and black. Wait! Pink is the only one that is ""skin tone""? Didn't they use 3 of the 4 colors to make SKIN tones? If the needed to describe the shade of pink why couldn't they say ""peach"" or ""light pink"" or something similar to that. Why make pink stand out as the only one that is ""skin tone.""It doesn't matter how good this product is, I cannot use it until the packaging is no longer (probably unintentionally) offensive and racist."
1,Not for anyone who likes protein or low-cost menus,"The book was informative and is based on scientific fact. However, the time to make and acquire the ingredients are time consuming, especially if you live in any small rural community. Only the wealthy can afford to have ""Dakota"" beef shipped to their home. It is extremely expensive.The diet is vegetarian based, if you aren't already a vegetarian, you probably will not like it. In addition, the recipes I tried were not tasty at all and we didn't enjoy the meals.The Sugar Busters Diet proved to be much better and we were both highly successful with it.Several friends have also tried both diets and found the recipes in Sugar Busters to be highly superior. It is no wonder as Sugar Busters was written by a group of physicians from New Orleans, the food capitol. Try it. . .I think you'll agree it works better, faster, and it's more enjoyable."
2,Too old,"This book was published in 1987. It is out of date, and for the most part, useless. The cholesterol drug he talks about has been supplanted by many newer and better drugs. The dietary suggestions are okay, but nothing new. Some recipes in the back are okay. All in all - don't buy it."
2,Don't buy this one - there is a newer version,"Robert Kowalski has a new updated version, called ""The New 8-Week Cholesterol Cure"""
5,I am so glad I discovered this author!!!,"This series was wonderful... eloquent with Characters that tear at our hearts. This series has elements of everything: romance, fantasy, a daring but compassionate heroine, the monstrous but kind-hearted companion, the quiet and mysterious and perhaps more monstrous other companion. I was hooked... and as long as these books are, it is quite a feat to be hooked for thousands of pages!!"
5,This series is great!,"All I can say is Mrs. Haydon can take you away to another world. She has actually ruined all other books for me, lol. I am currently waiting patiently for her 5th book. I truley think that if you like fantasy books you will enjoy this series. Best books I have read in years."
1,A little too dues ex machina for my tastes.,"It's an interesting concept, but too many things are just too coincidental to be entirely believable. Also, Rhapsody's extreme humility is annoying beyond belief, the characters take forever to figure out what was obvious to me, and the end was mostly predictable.That said, I did finish the series, mainly because I hate leaving stories unfinished (even when they're not to my liking).I certainly have no plans of ever buying the follow up, Requiem for the Sun, nor would I borrow it from a library to read."
5,Treasure,"This book is a treasure, a relic! I was not able to find lyrics, let alone chords or sheet music, for their songs nowhere on the internet!"
3,Vocal coach needed. Now!,"Although I consider myself a 'Gees fan, I have to admit that Robin is my least favourite vocalist of the group. That said, after liking a couple of the singles I decided to give the album a go.On the plus side, the songs are as strongly melodic as ever. At least half the tracks here would have made good singles back in the day. The production is a typically early '80's 'synthy' drone that does tend to detract from the songs 24 years on. Gibb's vocals, however, are an utter nightmare! I don't know if the original LP had a lyric sheet, but, boy, you certainly need one as RG's unearthly shrieks render most of the songs unintelligable. It's too much of a -not necessarily-good thing as Robin is given full reign to wreck almost every song with a grotesquely OTT display of appalling singing.Finally, I should also add that this CD really needs remastering as it's very 'soft' sounding with precious little bass and far too much treble."
3,Robing GibbHOW OLD ARE U?,This album is great to anyone who is a BEE GEES fan. For the most part it has the sound of pre-disco BG's. It's best only for diehard fans although Juliet has a top ten hit in Germany. For the rest of the public it's better to try the group recordings.
3,How Old Are You? So-so for Robin...,"I am a huge fan of Robin Gibb, however I was a little disappointed in this effort. Granted it did come out in the early 80's, so we do have to give him a little slack for that! My thoughts on this album are that he was not quite ""finding his niche"" for the times. There was alot of Brit-synth around at the time (Duran Duran, Tears For Fears, etc.)and Robin would have done better to not try to follow that path.But alas, in mine eyes, Robin can do no wrong, so I shall have to rate this a 3 of 5."
1,blue #1 and yellow #5 ?? WHAT !?,"So, we do not feed our children food dye for various reasons. This makes it tough to decorate cakes/treats for birthdays and holidays. We have been using INDIA TREE natural food coloring for years. Although the results are frosting colors much lighter then grocery store food dye.....the kids are happy and so are we. The other day i ordered the INDIA TREE ""Emerald City Green"" sparkling sugar to make pretty treats for St.Paddy's Day. The package arrived today and i could not be more shocked/upset. They use Blue#1 and yellow #5 in this product. I had assumed(my bad) all their products used natural alternatives.....if i had wanted these chemicals i would have gone to the grocery store and bought that cheap stuff. I'm so angry and very dissapointed."
5,Great!,"I bought this for my two year old daughter. She felt so secure and confident with this sweater that she didn't feel the need to hold on to me the whole time. Like she did with the arm type swimmies. I would reccommend this to any child learning how to swim. I have bought three, one for our house, one for the sitter's house and one for Grandmom's."
5,Grosse Pointe Girl,"Grosse Pointe Girl by Sarah Grace McCandless is not a typical diary from the well-to-do in this northern suburb of Detroit. It is instead almost an understated peek at the angst of the adolescence of one of its residents. It is not a whine, and like fine wine, the flavor is subtle yet rich. It truly sneaks up on you. Each chapter is well written with a vivid imagery, but ""The Lochmoor Moms"" is truly the apex. In one final sentence, Ms. McCandless captures the sense of a generation in suburbia."
5,Suburban life at it's best,"Spanning the years of Emma Harris's middle school to 10-year reunion experience, GROSSE POINTE GIRL is a short, yet revealing look at adolescence. Remember the days of 'going' with someone, terrifying, yet hopeful school dances, and navigating the dangerous waters of female friendships? It's all captured here in snapshot form.Grosse Pointe is a suburb of Detroit and after Emma's parents divorce, she is living on the fringes of the affluent area of town. During the course of the book she ditches her best friend for the popular crowd, gets ditched by the popular crowd, loses her virginity, finds true friendship and love, and learns the meaning of loss.The writing is spare, but it allows you to see through to the rigidity and sameness of adolescence and suburban life."
4,Great Camping Grill,"After reading the poor review of this grill, I knew that it wasn't how they all were. I bought this for camping this summer and it performed very well. We cooked steak, hot dogs and hamburgers, and egg sandwiches and coffee in the morning. The only complaint that I have is that, there really isn't a low setting on the stove. There is either high or higher! Overall though, great grill, would definately recommend it."
1,"Defective, poorly made, potentially unsafe product","It is unfortunate to have to write such a review, but the product received was so beyond unacceptable that I am compelled to do so. The unit was received new, but the hinges were already rusted, the closure hasp broken (poorly designed and executed), the grille had sloppily attached and bent locating pins and virtually all the lid edges were razor sharp. Made in China, this stove demonstrates no attention to detail, quality control or materials. I own several other brands of camping stoves and am dismayed that this unit was ever allowed out of the factory, much less, off the design table. Further, the design of the unit is poor and execution is extremely poor, if not downright unacceptable (in major ways). As this unit was new in the box, I can only assume that it represents the low level of quality and lack of respect the US manufacturer has for customers. Save yourself cut hands and returns, buy another brand."
2,"Great idea, poor design!","I had a lot of fun with this stove while it lasted but it did not last long -- about six months! I live on a sailboat and I used it every day; maybe someone who goes camping once a year will have a better experience. The burner did not simmer well (the flame kept creeping back up) but the grill worked great until the stove itself died. It seems to have a design flaw -- the regulator has an unusually narrow diameter tube and the propane tubes inside the stove are flimsy and wobbly. I called Century and they said this is the way the stove is supposed to be. Hmmmm. I did not think it would last long but I liked it so much that when it died I tried out another one. This one was immediately defective and I took it back. Neither Century nor Coleman seems to make a tough propane stove any more. Camp Chef may be a better, though much more expensive, choice for a person who does a lot of camping."
1,Don't bother..,"True, it's easy to install and use. But, without the ability to add grids (like feet, inches, etc.) it's useless. Very limited functionality in selecting and modifying selections (i.e. can insert a tree but the description remains, you can't remove it). Non-standand in terms of Windows, like right click on an object and expect to edit the properties, forget it. House designs, deck designs, etc. limited in color and type. It's cheap, but still not worth the price. I'll be doing my planning on graph paper instead of this."
1,Just awful,"As the previous reviewer stated, it doesn't seem possible to specify any kind of dimensions with your drawings. I bought this software for the purpose of designing the landscaping in my back yard. I measured my house and my fencing but there's no place to put these measurements in the software. This renders it basically useless for all but the most simplistic or rough designs."
3,For DC Lovers Only,"It's a very quick read, but I only recommend it for people who like DC because I would think it would be pretty boring otherwise."
2,Good But Not Great,"This book started off well and captured my attention from the start but failed to engage me all the way through to the end. The characters were colorful but undeveloped and there were many characters introduced but never fully fleshed out.Bailey and Louisa fall in love but why? Jon and Peter are happy but why? Eve and Max continue their relationship but why? The relationship problems are dwelled upon but the resolutions come almost as an afterthought. Sometimes the resolutions just appear, without any discussion.The characters in this book don't really have any serious problems and everything seems to sort itself out. The conflicts are few and amiable and do not feel like real life. The happy ending is of course expected because nothing really bad happens to these people and only confirmed my view that this book was good but not great. An enjoyable read but nothing I will recommend or remember in a few weeks."
1,A little disappointing,"As a native Washingtonian, I was drawn to the book by the title. About 50 pages into the book, I kept waiting for the plot to make some interesting twists and turns. The relationship between Bailey and Louisa was predictable and needless to say, the book didn't ""wow"" me. I guess I had different expectations. I enjoyed the references to local restaurants, bars, bookstores, etc., but found that the lack of character depth and compelling story lines left me feeling uninspired and bored. Leave this one on the shelf."
1,Like a written version of a bad sappy movie,"This was just a really, really bad book. Sappy, predictable, lacking any depth or art. I bought it because I lived near Dupont Circle one summer, but I think sitting on the circle watching the grass grow would be a more productive use of time than reading this book."
4,"More, Please","This book cries out for a sequel so that readers can find out what happened to all of the delightful characters that we met and left behind in DuPont Circle!I read this book in just a few hours and was sorry to close the book. It was a fun read, a low-key comedy of manners, with many permutations on the words ""couple"" and ""domesticity"". The various parenting scenes were right on the mark no matter who the parent was.While dealing with serious subjects like gay parenting, the author never preached. He let his characters do the talking and they did it so well!I especially loved the banter between Eve and her fiancee. Those two characters had some of the best scenes in the book.A light but clever look at all kinds of people who make up today's families."
4,Crampy,"Gosh, I'm amazed that you can buy this on Amazon.com. Anyway, I can't remember much about it (I heard it a long time ago), but it's well worth having - it's a collection of psychedelic folk songs, of a type that seemed to be almost close to the mainstream way back in the folk-obsessed late-60s / early 70s. Think 'Steeleye Span', only weirder, and you're half-way there. This was the strangest of the three albums I heard, and if you can take folksiness without gagging it's great."
3,"Jake & Mimi, oh darn it - I was almost there!","This was a pretty good book, which could've been a great book if the characters had been fleshed out (no pun intended). Jake's a master of seduction, yet we're never told how or where he's been trained or what kind of training? Kama sutra or tantra - inquiring readers want to know.Mimi's character was really underdeveloped. Considering what she's risking readers should know what motivates her. The author misses opportunities to draw us deeper into Mimi and Jake's minds. I wanted to feel the passion that rules Jake and the desire that has Mimi risking her fiancé. Mr. Baldwin gets high marks for all else, especially his handling of the scenes between Jake and the ladies. They were arousing without being explicit or uncomfortable (for me).Unfortunately the ending just didn't hit my spot, it left me unsatisfied, unlike the women who'd been with Jake! More detail and development next time!"
1,luckily i didn't pay money for this book--,"I obtained an advance copy of this book a few months ago, and read it because it sounded like an engaging, trashy novel. Well, it's not very engaging...the female characters are all gorgeous bodies for Jake to manipulate, and the sex scenes are overblown and not really believable...as is the dutiful explanation of why Jake treats women the way he does. Mimi is a boring, stereotyped character--hesitant about marrying her fiance because the sex isn't so great...thus begins the voyeuristic relationship Mimi and Jake that somehow isn't very believable. And the mystery stalker that is watching Mimi just seems to be a diversion so the novel can actually go somewhere. This book is better as a TV script for Ally McBeal or something..."
2,WHAT?! THAT'S IT?!???,"The title of of my review was basically my reaction when I flipped the last page only to find out that it REALLY was the end. So what happens between Jake and Mimi? I suppose the story leads you to believe that they ""end"" up together but the ending doesn't give much of an indication. I'm just glad I didn't have to spend $$$ to read this."
3,"A little gratuitous, but sometimes that's what you want","Mimi is making plans to marry her loving and safe fiancé when she meets Jake Teller, bold and sexy ladies man. She discovers that Jake goes beyond the typical wham bam, thank you ma'am. He seduces women, binds them, breaks them, makes them beg for release and satisfaction. Mimi, pure and simple, is fascinated by Jake. How far will she go to learn what she really desires? There is another being in the mix, watching, waiting for his chance to step in, and take Mimi to her breaking point."
1,Just a leader for Scientology,"Hubbard claimed he could make a person ""clear"" using this technology but then failed to ever produce someone who could demonstrate they were ""clear"". I tried some of it( having the process) and it was upsetting but not theraputic. I realise now that it was just a way for the guy who sold it to me to try and get me into Scientology. If you're going to read it, take it with a pinch of salt as all those ""case studies"" turned out to be made up and Hubbard's university degrees were made up too!"
1,Terribly written,"This book is full of hazy, muddled ideas. Now don't say that I didn't read it correctly. The first page of the book tells you to look up any words you don't understand. I followed that rule. The words make sense; the sentences, paragraphs, and ideas don't make any sense whatsoever. I was told this was a self help book. Instead I found it to be a book of vague common sense and muddled thinking of bad ideas mixed together. Don't bother with this one."
1,"The Cult from hell, and how this book started it.","It all starts out at a mall you are walking though and a zoned out man or women at a book stand speaks up to get you interested in this book. Its a slippery slop from here. You waste your money on the tapes and soon enough they have your bank account. l Rom Hubbard the author of the book and the church of Scientology has been able to make one of the largest scam cults in history.If you need self help, see a real religion that is not after your money, there are many free ones out there, and work is not forced."
1,complete crap,This book is clearly speculative nonsenseScientology is a pseudoscience and more or less a cult for those who seek meaning is the strange and unusual.I recommend this book for a good laugh and that's where it ends.
1,"fiction, not science","I will let the philosophy professor Robert Carroll sum up my feelings about this book.---What Hubbard touts as a science of mind lacks one key element that is expected of a science: empirical testing of claims. The key elements of Hubbard's so-called science don't seem testable, yet he repeatedly claims that he is asserting only scientific facts and data from many experiments. It isn't even clear what such ""data"" would look like. Most of his data is in the form of anecdotes and speculations ... Such speculation is appropriate in fiction, but not in science."
1,Greatest dogmatic fraud of the 20th Century,"With the exception of 'Mein Kampf', no other book published in the 20th century has inspired so much blind zealotry, bigotry, hatred, and mass fraud on the part of the 'true believers'. What began as a third-rate self help guide written by a hack science fiction novelist has turned into a diatribe against common sense.'Dianetics' has been described as the ultimate self-help guide, in fact nothing could be further from the truth. In reality, 'Dianetics' was written by an author of pulp science fiction who believed he could transform his arcane theories into a workable religion. What L Ron Hubbard never truly realized before his demise in 1986 is that he had succeeded beyond his wildest expectations. The minions of $cientology have infiltrated all walks of society, thanks to the gibberish which graces the pages of 'Dianetics'."
1,Absolute Rubbish,"Don't buy this junk, filled with trash that won't do you any good. All $cientologi$t want is your money and if you have none, your out of luck. Try to leave the church to criticize them? Expect a bunch of bullying, read it up they actually encourage it."
1,What the * is this guy talking aobut,"I've read a lot of books on spiritual development, but this one was just plain weird. But ok, we are all driven by sex and the need to survive. I get it. Very rambling. Was never quite able to figure out if it's a book on religion or psychology. There were some derivative points taken from others such as Maltz and some TA theory, but over all this book is a mess only because he (L. Ron)must not of wanted it edited by anyone but himself. Not impressed."
1,"Like Battlefield Earth, only slower...","After watching Battlefield Earth, I rushed out to get my own personal copy of Dianetics, so I too could believe in this mysterious truth that was a well kept secret to all. Wow was I further from being right.This book talks about mental health, curing ones self with herbs and roots. rubbing powdered Xenu penis on your temples to gain enlightenment, and believing that all people are from a volcano.This book is not the cinematic masterpiece of John Travolta SciFi I had hoped it would be.If you are looking for something to tide you over until the eagerly awaited next installment of Battlefield Earth, I suggest ordering a hamburger and awaiting a raccoon in return."
2,Why read this book?,"I thought the book was very hard too read, for the author had a very high vocabulary. However, after receiving the ""auditing"" for ONLY twelve hours my life completely changed for the better! My IQ rose higher, i felt happier and even more attractive. When before i had a hard time confronting people and handling situations i am now am able to be better in life. If you have a high vocabulary or are willing to look up many words i recommend it. This is no ordinary book! L.Ron Hubbard sure did his research well."
4,Why people have weird impulses is not so mysterious now.,"After reading this book I could understand why people acted horribly, hurtful and stupidly. I realised there was something that came in and tangled thoughts and teared apart reason. I also realised that the people's whose thoughts were being tangled didn't know why. Dianetics sheds lots of light on why you have weird unexplained feelings of doubt and depression and fear. Although this is a serious topic, the mind, the author writes in a simple, clear way. He's quite funny in places and he certainly answered a lot of questions that were hovering in my mind."
5,Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health,"This book and other books by L. Ron Hubbard have helped my life in ways I never thought were possible. I believe that if you would like to better your life in any way, this book is the right start in that direction. Give it a read and decide for your self. If [...] could help your life be easier, isn't that worth it?"
5,Dianetics is a Miracle!,I have read the Dianetics book 3 times now and have gone to the Dianetics Foundation and completed my own certification as Dianetics counselor.The book was difficult to read at first but I did as the important note at the beginning says and read the book with the use of a dictionary. It took me about 2 months to complete the book the first time and I had numerous realizations about myself and others that helped me to get a better handle on my own problems I had in dealing with others.EVERYONE needs to read this book.
1,Service is terrible,I ordered this item a month ago! And it still hasn't been delivered. Last I checked started USPS took at MOST 5-8 buisness days to deliever an item. This is ludacris.
3,The Most Contoversial Book of the Century!,"This book is a piece of work! Scientologist swear by it, critics and Scientists loath it. In this book you will read about the views of L. Ron Hubbard's on how the mind works. To L. Ron Hubbard the mind is similar to a computer, if a person receives bad input, called engrams, then this will cause them to have problems such as fear, doubt and other other ailments that will affect their lives. His belief was that these engrams could be erased by using a discussion with a person trained in Dianetics counseling that are called auditors. He believed that engrams had a charge and with a e-meter you could discharge the engram by going over the incident until the e-meter showed that it was discharged. This is very similar to what other counselors do in that they discuss bad experinces with their subjects. It is diffucult to read, but if you want to know about L. Ron Hubbard and Scientology then this book will give great insight about the subject."
5,The BEST book for improving one's life!,"When you read this book you will understand why the world today is in the condition it is.When you read it you will find out what caused bad relationships, bad health, unwanted emotions and criminality.And after knowing the cause of them, you will read how you can handle it and get rid of them once and forever.Because it gives solutions applicable in life, in your friends and in you yourself, so that you can have a better life!When you read it and apply it, you will see the difference!I did it!Do it yourself and you will remember that day forever!"
5,Just read it,"This book changed my life. Since reading it, I can handle things better and I don't find myself doing things that I later regret. I think people really can get better if they apply the stuff in it.I know there are a lot of crazy theories about this book, like it's a cult and evil and stuff. But if you actually use it correctly, you can see for yourself that all of that is lie. Cult? I honestly don't know what they're talking about...So basically, I would say just read it and get the truth for yourself."
4,Universal principles,"Although this book is recognized as the foundation of a controversial religion, I believe it is best regarded as a handbook of universal principles. The various levels of enlightenment attained in this religion lead the participant into deep inner exploration and greater self awareness. I recommend this book only if you are willing to read it with an open mind. Another classic book of universal principles that logically explains how to master thinking and feelings and make the most of any situation is Optimal Thinking: How To be Your Best Self. If you are a seeker, you will find optimal solutions."
1,Ridiculous and beyond,"Dianetics is no more than pornography for an abortion fetish. I had to come right out and say it. Children cover your eyes and ears. I never imagined there would be such a thing as an abortion fetish, but there it was. Every other page of Dianetics is either a case history of an attempted abortion (people remember what happened even when they were zygotes in Hubbard land) or a pregnant mother being unfaithful or beaten up or both( I repeat: people remember things from the moment the sperm finds the egg)...and they founded a religion on it! I have to admit, I only read the first 2/3, but the pattern was there: Attempted abortion, over and over and over. I couldn't do it-I couldn't keep reading this book. I understand that this was written before Roe v Wade, and such things did happen, but not on every other page. Do not read this."
1,THIS is what's destroying people's minds?!,You have GOT to be kidding. I slogged through this confused gibberish in an attempt to give it a fair hearing. What an utter waste of time. Hubbard was nuts but clever. It's just hard to believe that educated people get sucked into the Scientology morass.
1,Pure Rubbish,"I have read this book twice now. I can find nothing here of redeeming value. It seems to lack either scientific or even logical backing. I am concerned that someone with no discernible background in medicine, psychology or psychiatry can claim to know how the mind works."
1,People believe this?,"This is just one of hundreds of reviews, so i'll keep it short. The book is really dry, and doesn't even make a decent argument. I have a feeling that many of these reviews are written by those who religiously follow Hubbard's work (Scientology). Otherwise, it would have undoubtedly been given a much lower rating!!!"
5,Valuable information on living,I found that reading this book really helped me understand the people around me and give me some tools to work with. I had always wanted to help others and it also gave me an additional tool to do that.
5,"A ""must-read"" if you are interested in self-improvement","The book gave me insight into how the mind works, why people go ""out of control,"" and how and why unwanted emotions kick in.That information alone would have been worth the time and money invested in reading Dianetics. But additionally, the book contains the procedure to actually handle the cause of unwanted emotion. I read the book, I applied the procedure, and IT WORKS!"
4,Why so threatened?,"I can't believe that there are so many people who feel so threatened by this book. I'm not a scientologist or even a big fan of ugly Hubbard but this book is definitely worth reading and it deserves to be judged on it's own merit and not on the basis of other works by hubbard. I have found the techniques in this book to be very effective and I really believe that regarding this subject (Dianetics and not Scientology) Hubbard had something. Of course, the reader should make up his own mind about this book and others by L. Ron Hubbard."
5,The proof is in the pudding,"When I first started reading this book in 1976, I simply couldn't put it down. As I devoured its contents, there were so many, ""Oh, that's why such and such and so and so happens to me and to others around me."" Anyone can benefit from the application of Dianetics. It's simple and it works. That's really what is important, isn't it? The reviews I have read on this site are either totally for or totally against Dianetics. No one can decide which is true for you but yourself."
3,Some interesting viewpoints,"This book has some interesting insights about the various levels of consciousness. I believe it has several flaws, as do many of the positive thinking books. I still recommend reading it to decide if you can get some jewels, and I would definitely recommend Optimal Thinking: How to Be Your Best Self as well."
5,This book has the answers,"Reading this book was a revelation. So many questions about my own past, about why I react the way I do and why others act and react as they do were answered. After reading Dianetics I found that I understood others better, I tolerated their idiosyncrasies better and, best of all, I could effectively help myself and others to a better life. I highly recommend this book if you want a better life."
5,Well - It worked for me.,I studied many things before I ran across Dianetics.What can I say - what I experienced when I sat down to receive the counseling as described in this book... was exactly what Hubbard spoke about in the book.It works! That's all I was looking for!Read it and see for yourself.
1,Terriable.,"Not scientific with its evaluations. The book likes to use large ""science sounding"" words to describe things, but it doesn't source the studies. Most of the ""data"" presented is anecdotal and doesn't follow the scientific method. Essentially the book is useless as anything, but a door stop or a fire starter."
1,Pure fiction,Not even a good science fiction novel. Great little earner for the 'Church' of $cientology though.
3,Interesting but not practical,This is an interesting read and gives you an idea of what dianetics is about. But it isn't a practical book because it is only a stepping stone to taking courses and auditing which will ultimately cost you thousands and thousands of dollars.
5,Dianetics Review,"I can't believe I've had this book for 36 years! I just finished reading ""Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health"" for the first time, last week. I had to use a dictionary and the glossary a lot, because Hubbard's vocabulary is extensive. But it was worth it. I feel wiser. I actually know what's going on with people now, and know how to really help them."
5,the biggest most beautifull book in the whole world,"full of what? Full of beautifull language right crisp and straight from the tongue. Like an oyster in mother-of-pearl L. Ron Gubbard makes light work on an intricate subject. The evolution of man, and life on earth! All in one amazing hard to find and out of the way galaxy science-fiction pulp-paper waste-bin or trash-can near you."
5,This book puts psychiatry to shame!,"I read ""Dianetics"" when I was 17, and everything made sense. The lies of life became very apparent and the truth was there to see. If you havent read ""Dianetics"" you are still asleep so get it quickly and wake up. bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"
5,This book Changed my life,"I read this book twice. I can see why some don't like it. It requires some type of education. I found the book to be an amazing look into the human mind. I understand how it works and why and I understand why some people leave poor reviews, they don't like being figured out."
3,A big book with big ideas and big words.,"I've attempted reading this book on several occations and have yet to get through it. It seems to be written for a learned audience. It is has some practical stuff, but I had a hard time understanding it all.I saw the video tape on the same subject and it was presented in a lot simpler format that I actually could and did follow. I am depressed much less often after doing some of the therapy with a friend as shown in the video.I guess the book was over my head."
5,It all makes sense now!,"I always struggled with how the human mind works. Now I really understand it! This book is technical, but it's like the ""owner's manual"" to the human mind. I understand now why people act the way they do, why I react to certain situations, etc. I would be lost without it."
4,Worth the effort to read-life changing potential,"This book takes some perserverence to get through but the understanding one gets at the end is unbelievable. It opens up a whole new world of realization about the power of the mind and makes total sense. I worked as a psychiatric nurse for a very short time - until I realized the field of psychiatry/psychology was clueless about how the mind really worked. The ""authorities"" were crazier than the patients. This book explains how the mind truly does work and why conventional ""therapy"" and drugs do not work. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants a greater understanding of our trials and tribulations and where they really come from."
1,Just not for me I guess.,"I tried to read this book in college for a report on self help books. I had enjoyed some of L. Ron Hubbard's science fiction, especially Battlefield Earth (much, much better than the movie) so I thought that this would be a good fit for me. Unfortunately I just couldn't stand it. It was so dull and it is now one of the few books that I have started, but that I had absolutely no interest in finishing. This means a lot considering I managed to slog through the entire ""Mission Earth"" series that he wrote which is full of deviant sexual behavior (including torture and pedophilia, really why ruin a perfectly good sci-fi story with all that?). So I thought it was just plain bad. More ""Mission Earth"" than ""Battlefield Earth"". I would not recommend this book."
1,Totally unreadable,"If I could have given this crappy book 0 stars I would have. I had never read anything this bad before,I tried to be patient hoping that at some point I would start understanding what this guy was talking about but it never happened. I simply do not understand all the high ratings on this book,I guess it must be Tom Cruise and others who have consumed the Scientology Kool aid..."
1,Bad Science Fiction,"This is one of the worst science fiction books I have read. In fact, if it wasn't written by the renowned science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, I wouldn't have pegged this book for science fiction at all. Almost seems like Hubbard was trying to write something more along the lines of a philosophical or religious text. I guess his mind went off on a tangent. Oh well. He should have scrapped this self-indulgent exercise and stuck with the ""Mission Earth"" project. That's pretty good."
5,Great book,"Simply a book of self discovery. I understand myself and everyone better after reading and understanding this book. It explains how the mind REALLY works. You have to be somewhat intelligent to understand it though. It's a study. It's not an easy read. If you lack intellegence (like the other review, this guy Bashing L Ron Hubbard and Scientology, boy does he have an axe to grind!) then you should just get the video to totally understand it. It has helped me and many others that I know.Whatever you do, do not go into the church.Paul"
1,Waste of time,"The thing that bothers me about this book is how it lacks in any sort of scientific validity. The book proposes theories about how the mind works without any research evidence. The concepts are dreamed up by this science fiction writer and don't really have any sort of relevance to how you can become happier, etc. If you want to improve yourself, read a self-help book written by a mental health professional, counselor/psychologist,etc. If you want to go to Hubbard's dream world of magic, read Dianetics."
1,Get a second opinion.,"I read this book years ago and I found it quite appealing. Hubbard sure seemed to know what he was talking about. I even considered joining Scientology. Luckily I also found a copy of the book L. Ron Hubbard, Messiah or Madman? It changed my mind and saved me a lot of grief."
1,Not even good science fiction,"It was worse than I thought it would be. I had assumed there would be more fuzzy positive thinking suggestions and that might account for some of its success. But no, it really is as odd and unconvincing as people have suggested.I can only assume that most Scientologists haven't even read this book. It is even too dull to be effective as a parody."
2,stupid and foolish,"This book starts out well, but if you just stop and think about what Hubbard is saying, it is foolish.Don't get sucked in by this or the ""religion"" it spawned. Save your money."
1,"Fictional, poorly written, and crafted to mislead people","This is a fictional work under the guise of a religious guide, crafted by a fiction writer. It's poorly written, and despite its claims, offers no actual insight into the workings of human though. What it does offer is a gateway into a corporate controlled pseudo-religion designed to extract as much money from patrons as possible, while leading them to believe that they are gaining more control over their own lives. The organization built around this fictional work is constantly being charged with fraud, as well as being considered a cult, all around the world.Don't buy, don't read, and certainly don't talk to anybody whom would recommend it. You're much better off sticking to the classic science fiction, not this poppycock."
1,A Cult Classic!,"Prepare yourself for some of the best brainwashing in the industry. Dianetics is preparatory reading for indoctrination into the Church of Scientology and a must have for anyone that seeks to place blame for their personal failures at the feet of an invisible and untouchable entity.I suppose the best review I can provide is to submit a quote from the author himself:""Writing for a penny a word is ridiculous, if a man really wanted to make a million dollars, he would start a religion."" - L. Ron Hubbard"
1,Childish prose in service of circular logic.,"There is no ""science"" here. Please take some time before you buy this book and familiarize yourself with Mr. Hubbard's background before he wrote this book. Go to Wikipedia and get educated."
1,DUMB BOOK,"This book contains no science, no proof, no logic and happens to be the beginning of a cult. Stay far away."
5,Actually Delivers,"When I first read this thing I thought it was like all the other fad books - but it blew me away. The third section is all about actually doing it, practical application. I have been using Dianetics for over ten years now to anything from relieving stress to overcoming personal hangups. It is the only self-help book I know that actually delivers. Check it out!"
4,Good Book,"Great book for getting to what's inside you without stirring up too much negative. A lot of it makes sense, and you don't need to adhere to Scientology."
1,How to use Dianetics,"You can sum up this DVD in 3 simple steps, and save yourself some cash:1. Get any copy of Dianetics that you may have.2. Throw it in the bin.3. Enjoy your life."
1,Better options,An overly complex theory full of psychobabble to the extreme limits of human imagination.Solution focused brief therapy as written about by Insoo Kim Berg among others is far more worth the mental energy than this garbage.
3,on my list of books to read.,I cant really rate the book yet. I've heard of the book as well as what others might think and i was told it's informative
2,A total disappointment,This item is about as cheap as you can get. I wouldn't be surprised if it only cost 50 cents to make.The fit is also not very good as it isn't molded very well to the shape of the IPAQ - again a quality issue.It was an unfortunate disappointment.
2,iPAQ kept slipping out of this case,The case never kept the iPAQ secure. The iPAQ would fall out of case all the time.
2,Still don't have the product,I ordered the product on 3-5-04 and it's now 3-17-04. Seems a bit slow for even standard shipping.
4,PDA-lite,"I have owned two Palms and two iPacs which kept me organized when I was a manager. I have broken three PDA's over the last six years. Now I am retired and decided I should try something that had a lower cost, but provide me with some of the organizational features I like in a handheld.This orgnizer fills my needs for addresses, notes, and calendar.One of the features I really appreciate is the thin, lightweight, flip-open, protective case. I purchased an extra organizer for a 6th grader. She read through the instructions and mastered the instructions in less than an hour.This organizer is an excellent value for basic use.If you are addicted to Palms or Window systems, prepare to take time to learn how to use this organizer. If you want to add software, you will need to consider more expensive options."
3,beware...,"just bought this thing. note that the alarm tone is very quiet. when it is in the case, on your hip, you can hardly hear it, if at all. if you want something to beep you, this might not be the item for you. I haven't found any way to increase the volume either."
1,This product is outdated and needs to be melted down.,"I purchased this in hopes of being updated in my calendar. After opening it and hoping to connect with my computer, the device comes with an outdated 5 pin connecter and the quality of this item was equal to my four year olds toys. The plastic is cheap and the product reflects this. I contacted the seller who told me they do not accept any returns. What are the odds of someone not accepting any returns when they sell electronics. This product is aweful."
1,Bad,Only had a month so far and the screen is already illegible. I am cannot read most of it. Not worth the money.
1,Poor buying experience- disappointing unit - no help,"This product was purchased to help a student with organization. It arrived minus a stylus and with a previous user's data still on it. An e-mail to the vendor yielded a form response and no help. A follow-up e-mail produced the stylus some four weeks after delivery of the Organizer. Of the product itself, the display is dark and hard to read, and the alarm for the to-do list is all or nothing. One cannot set the alarm for selected events - something that was not clear from the description. Furthermore, documentation shows a procedure for setting the alarm that includes tapping a symbol that doesn't exist on the display. A request for help on the Sharp site, has yet to provide any assistance two weeks later. Poor buying experience and disappointing unit. Recommend spending more and getting a unit with better features and from a different manufacturer."
3,organizer,This product is not for me. The entries are too difficult for me to read and it cannot take all of the info I want to list for an entry. I cannot recommend it.
3,Scheduler,Sharp YOP20H 1MB Electronic OrganizerAfter reviewing the item. I was disappointed with the software. My computer would not load the software and the cable was not set up for ease of downloading. After the purchase of the additional cable and having to upgrade the software thru the internet. It would download the addresses I needed to.
3,Didn't last long,"at my house. Purchased for 11 year old boy. A few weeks being tossed around in the backpack was the end of it. The screen was hard to view, not enough definition. After using my Palm with color and great graphics, it looked cheap and tacky. Worked well enough for what it was, but not very hardy. It really needs a better cover to protect the screen from scratches (and from being shattered, which is what happened to this one)."
3,Its OK,"I bought this product to replace one I received about 10 years ago. The screen was going on the old one. I am frustrated that the memo feature doesn't hold very many words. I like to put my passwords and ID's for online stuff in the memo pad. I had to continue some on another memo. Also, I don't like the way the addresses show on the screen as one long address I keep needing to scroll thru. Did I miss something in the instructions?"
3,Sharp organizer,"This product is great, the only thing it is missing is a calender to help you plan your schedule!"
4,What she wanted!,"My 9 year old daughter has wanted a palm organizer since the first time she watched the movie The Cat in the Hat with Dakota Fanning. It was difficult to find exactly what we were looking for because today everything comes with a cellphone and we are not yet ready for her to have one. This little PDA is great! I once had a Palm Pilot and I have to say, this is much easier to use and has great features. The price is a fraction of what a Palm cost. So far we are very pleased with its performance."
2,Hidden calendar?,"I have an old Sharp organizer that I have happily used since 1998. My husband had its twin, and recently lost it. So, I picked this up as a replacement. Because mine has a nice calendar display it never occurred to me that this unit's ""scheduler"" as advertised on the blister pack didn't include a calendar. I probably spent half an hour trying to ""find"" a calendar and found the unit easy to use and a pretty self explanatory manual. But, I certainly would find it more useful with a calendar. Anyone else miss this feature? Or, better yet, anyone else find a hidden calendar?"
2,doesn't hold any info!,"i have 3+ phone numbers for many of my friends, but this organizer only lets me enter two of them. plus, after you enter the phone #, it doesn't let you type ""cell"" or ""work"" or ""home"" or anything to let you know which # it is! for $19 i won't complain too much, and it's nice to have as a backup in case my other organizer fails me for some reason, but i was hoping for a bit more capabilities."
3,Not what I'd expected,Followed the directions carefully and am having alot of difficulty gettingit set up. Some of the numbers and letters don't display clearly.It's ok but not great.
3,Good cheap electronic organizer,Easy to operate. Some inconvenience with the limited (36) number of symbols in the schedule mode. English-Spanish translator and Diet Function Mode just use the memory. Overall - good for its price.
3,Nothing fancy,"The linking to Outlook on your computer doesn't work, as many of the reviews I had read stated, but I just wanted a simple device to hold passwords and addresses to replace an old organizer I had. If you want something a bit ""cutting edge"", look elsewhere, if you want something cheap and basic, this might be an option."
3,It does a lot for not many $,I got it for my daughter for Christmas and she likes it quite a bit. I found the screen to be busy and the data a bit difficult to enter. I had an older Sharp Wizzard that used the keyboard approach and I prefer it. It is not a PALM but it has it's place.
2,Good product - would try something else,"I liked this product a lot - at least the idea of it with less of a price tag. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for in this case.The stylus will 9 times out of 10 bring up the letter next to the one you are trying to use, the phone book is set up weird, the appointments/memos start in date order and the format of them are odd. There's not much room to write. You constantly need to switch between numbers and letter keyboards and it just gets to be a pain by the end of entering 1 contact or appointment. The translater is a little hard to use - sometimes it won't bring up words or it will bring up a completely different word that has those letters in it. I would definitely not rely on it if that's a reason you're getting this productThe only thing I use it for anymore is the pedometer and the games. I would have to say - go ahead and pay a little more with something that is better quality."
1,Simple,If all you want is a phone list this is the item for you. BUT if you are interested in adding addresses this organizer lacks! It only allows you to input addresses as oneliners which means you have to scroll to read the complete address. I would not buy this again.
1,organizer,This was not up to Sharp's standards. I can't get it to do anything like put an address in and keep it. Read the instructions several time and can't get it to work.
2,It is what it is,This is a good organizer for someone who is in middle or high school. Or maybe even for someone who loses things easily so does not want to spend a lot of money on an actual palm. Its okay for what it is but it did not fit my needs. I ended up having to buy an actual palm and I gave this organizer to my little sister to play with.
2,"""Where's my back-up?""","I purchased two of these about three years ago and gave one to my mother. We use them every once in a while. I later replaced the batteries, and when I turned the units on, I noticed parts of the numbers and letters were missing. Needless to say, this is very upsetting! So I'm warning you, if you have one, you better get a back-up before it's too late."
2,Broke after 3 years 2 days,"This TV is / was fine until it quit working. A few days after my Circut City extended warranty ran out it quite on me. It won't turn on and now I'm stuck with a 400+ pound broken TV in my living room.I would not reccomend this set - much better set's on the market that are lighter, better and cheaper than this one."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TV!!!!!!!!,"Had this TV for 4 years. Some days it turns on and some days it does'nt. Called SONY and they told me I had to take it into a certified repair center, which, by the way, the closest one is 45 minutes from my house, not to mention..I can't lift it!! Called the service guy..he told me it was the tube and would cost $375 to fix. Total load of crap....I did my own research and found that it is an electical problem with one or more circuit boards....very common with this model. Called SONY again...they basically said...too bad!! If you do your research, you will find this problem is very common with this model......A LOT OF MONEY TO PAY FOR A DISPOSABLE TV!!!!"
4,still great in 2010,"i purchased this set used, yesterday (2/2010). still a great picture and wide range of features. I believe this set is 7 years old and still going strong. fyi - i have an original 36"" sony vega purchased back in 1998 or 99 and it, too, still works beautifully."
2,Broke after 3 years 4 months,"The problem I experienced with this set was similar to the January review posted here. When the set worked it was great. No complaints. Then it wouldn't turn on so we had it repaired. The power supply thingy went out. The repairman said this was a very common problem for this TV. It ended up costing $350 to fix it. I'm still not convinced that repairing it was the right move, but that's what we did. Maybe I just expect too much from these modern day electronics. It just seems to me that a $1300 TV should not need a repair for many years. If I was to purchase a new TV today, I would definately not purchase this set. It is extremely heavy and bulky. LCD would be the route I would take."
3,good but lacking........,"i was super excited by this collection of games, and i really wish i could give it 4 or 5 stars, but i can't. the two pac mans are great, but the controls are maddeningly difficult. Glaga and Glaxian are basically similar and the controls are ridiculous.....simply innefficient. DIG DUG and Pole Position are fine, but again the controls leave much to be desired, creating a level of difficulty that is simply too high to provide a fun challenge. All of that aside, these games are pretty cool, and pretty addictive. For FUN, i give it 5 STARS, for CONTROLS, i only give 3 STARS. figure out that average, and then go buy the game anyway..... it's a lot of fun and nostalgia."
3,Great Games. Too Bad Nintendo Controllers Can't Handle Them.,"These games are classics. Many of the game sounds, sadly, are not from the arcade games of yesteryear (they are, in general, more annoying). The Nintendo 64 controllers perform fairly poorly with most of the games in this collection. If you are the nostalgic type, want to reminisce about all those times you bummed quarters off your best friend (or your parents) at the local pizza joint, don't mind consistently low scores, and can get this game on the cheap, go for it! As for me, nostalgia only goes so far."
4,I get to keep my quarters!!!,"My youngest son insisted to him mom that this should be my gift for father's day. Being a sound and worldly adult I said I didn't care. Now that I have it I just smile and grin. I don't think I can count the number of quarters I spent on these games in my youth, in fact a coffie shop near the house has MS Pacman and Galaga and I spent quarters there with both of my boys. The games themselves are a joy but there are several weaknesses. The contols for the PACMAN games respond slowly (or maybe I'm just slower) and standard N64 Controler isn't easy for POLE POSITION. On the whole this is a great set of games invoking a great set of memories and most important fun I can have with my sons."
1,Received Wrong Game,"I received the wrong game. Not only did I receive the wrong game, but it was for a completely different gaming system."
1,Attention 6th graders,"Here is a book written just at your level. Fern Michael is one of my favorites. Hence my purchase of Future Scrolls. What a shock to find this new one such a disappointment. The wording is so simple,the plot so pathetic and the characters so dislikable, you fault yourself for even finishing it. It comes complete with a heroine with no self-respect, a hero who seems to love being obnoxious and even a ""ghost"" who solves real problems for them.And when its over, you still have no idea why the scrolls were so important. YUCK!!!"
1,HORRIBLE!,"My nine year old could write a more coherent story! The basic plot of this story, had it been fully developed and well written, could have been a wonderful novel. Unfortunately, this writer could not produce. Weak and laughable characters, unrealistic events, and the most interesting and compelling part -- why I actually finished the book -- was never revealed! What were these scrolls and their impact on humanity???"
1,Not at all happy with this book....,"I was so disappointed in this book, that I really wondered if Ms. Michaels actually wrote it. First of all, the heroine, Dani, is a chain smoker. That turns me off. But she is a culinary master in the kitchen. Try and figure that mix. Maria is a six year old who at times talks like she is twenty. ""I was going down our mosaic corridor on my way to the library"" just doesn't sound like a 6 year old.The evil wife is so evil, that I can't believe the super intelligent and successful Dr. Alex Mendenares didn't have her done in years ago. And of course the monk ghost shows up now and then with the whirling wind and things flying everywhere. Sorry, but this was a total turn off and I stopped reading it before I found out if Dani ever get off those darn cigarettes."
1,Absolutely dreadful!,"Improbable plot, stilted dialogue, characters who act out erratically and stupidly. I can't believe an author with this one's reputation would put out something like this; and I definitely can't believe anyone would publish it.Wish I could give it negative stars."
1,Someone stole the writer's identity??,"Please, Please tell me that is the truth. I mean, after reading at least 7-10 of Ms. Michael's books, I just cannot believe that she actually let her name be attached to this novel. The writing was bad, choppy, plot all over the map, no flow to this story whatsoever. Please don't waste your money on this book - thank God I borrowed it from the library and am not out any $$."
1,Was this book even edited?,"Where was the editor for this book? Inconsistencies, dreadful character development, rushed writing - it seems more like a synopsis for a book than an actual published book. Don't waste your money on this title."
4,didi,AS always the book was very enjoyable. Ms michaels comes through with stories that are hard to put down. I recommend this book as a 4 star.
3,Only lasted 4 months,"This printer worked wonderfully for the first 4 months, but then got the imaginary paper jam problem that I have seen on other reviews. When speaking with technical support, they basically said ""tough luck"" and we had to buy another printer. The cartridges are cheap and last a fairly long time -- it even had a Staples brand one that was compatible, only $7 for black & $12 for color."
4,4 stars for a $50 printer,"I replaced my Epson RX500 ($245.00) due to $$$ ink replacement and other issues, and I love this little printer! After almost five months of steady printing I'm replacing the black ink tank for the first time (about $7). It's a little rough on the paper feed but cranks documents out quickly. Photo quality is average for the price of this unit. However, compared to the enormous costs of the Epson ink tanks, this Canon has already paid for itself. I've printed out resumes, pictures, spreadsheets, and loads of emails on this machine. Well worth the price!"
5,Canon Pixma iP1500,"This is a great printer at any price. The print quality is good and you can even print photos if you want. The ink cartridges are inexpensive, especially if you go with remanufactured, and overall, the printer is a great value. The only bad part is that the printer does not have an output tray, but don't let that stop you from buying this printer because it is truly a great value."
4,Canon PIXMA iP1500 Photo Printer,"Nice printer, works fairly quicker than my previous Canon. Only downside, as other have pointed out, is the lack of catch tray.My old ink worked just fine for this one also, didnt even need to buy a differnt type."
3,Freezes Internet Browser,"Overall - Great quality, average speed prints, crappy software compatibility. You get a good deal for the price.The Easy Web Print Software that comes with the printer freezes Mozilla Firefox, and Internet Explorer. Maybe just my computer sucks. The printing quality is great, the printer never jams, kinda slow but that may be due to my long usb2.0 cable."
5,SEEMS TO WORK PRETTY GOOD,I bought this printer based on the reviews given below. I was trying to find a printer that was good quality and used lower cost ink cartridges. So it has been pretty good. I have used it since july of 2005 and it has performed well. Ink cartridges are much cheaper than my former HP photosmart printer p1000 i think that's what it was called. The only thing is i wished this printer had a paper exit tray. But anyway it has been very dependable and i like it. I would buy another one. gg
4,Prints Great and saves tons of money!!,"If you hate spending $35 or more on printer cartridges like I did, get this unit. I can get cartridges for about $2-$5 a pop and the print quality is great. I don't print pictures on it, but I did when I get it. Picture quality is ok(from what I can remember), but for doc printing it's great!"
1,It gets paper jamed easily!,"I used to have a S300.It worked great and it's really cost effective. That why I bought this one last week. However, this new one gets paper jamed easily, and sometimes it just fails tofeed the paper in but still sends paper jamed message.( I used the the HP 21 pounds papers bought with the printer).I am considering to return it, does anyone has the same experience? How to fix it?"
1,Poorest Designed Software Ever,This software is extremely frustrating to work with. You can't even draw a simple straight line! How does one make an organization chart without the ability to add straight lines or arrows!? I would NOT recommend Instant Flowcharts to anybody.
4,Overkill - 'W.F.O.' (Atlantic),"'W.F.O.' is something like my fifth Overkill CD/lp I've ever had,so I am familiar with most of their material.On this effort,vocalist Bobby 'Blitz' Ellwsworth and crew had apparently parted ways with their long time producer,Terry Dale in order to handle that very chore themselves.So MUCH better than their dismal 'I Hear Black' offering.The blazing guitar work done here by Rob Cannavino and Merrit Gant works well on tracks like ""Fast Junkie"",the ass-kicking ""Supersonic Hate"",""The Wait"" and the raging ""What's Your Problem"".Plain and simple,a good thrash catalog title."
4,What the??? Import? Travesty.,"I've had these tracks for so long, I can't remember where they originally came from. I originally had the album, so I'm kinda surprised to see it here as an import-only. Bizarre, 'cause some of Overkill's best tracks are on this album.I submit:Where It HurtsThe Wait/New High in LowsWhat's Your Problem?R.I.P. (Undone)Those four tracks alone are worth the purchase price, certainly at the ""used"" prices I'm seeing here.I mean, these are some of the fast, loudest, heaviest songs in the true Overkill tradition. You can't go wrong with those songs. I'm listening to them over and over again now, just because I had forgotten how much I truly loved 'em."
2,2 and a half,"Overkill has been around for along time. When I first purchased W.F.O., I was a bit dissapointed with the album. Even though I still listen to this every once in a blue moon, there are only a couple quality songs on this. Its nothing like HorroScope, and I believe nothing will be, yet its still a little weak. If you want some Great Overkill start with Taking Over or HorrorScope."
4,"Season 3 Episode: "" THE SET-UP""","This two-part episode called the ""The Set-Up"" was by far my favorite. It had all the ingredients of major motion-picture action movie. Were Starsky & Hutch had to protect a federal witness, in witness protection. Our beloved detectives had to throw away their badges, in order to clear their name. Then had to clear another potential suspect who was gunned down, but survived and had amnesia. Starsky & Hutch peaked in season 3."
5,"Old friends revisited, the real Starsky and Hutch","Having been reacquainted with Starsky and Hutch only last year I was delighted to order Season 3. This season is focused alot on Hutch and the things he went through! The friendship bond is never so apparant as in the episode ""The Plague"" Thanks Amazon.com too cause you are the only place to order from that finds my house!"
3,Season 4 - get it early from Australia or Europe,"Season 3 was great compared to season 4, but there are definitely a few gems in 4. It was released in Australia (region 4 DVD, PAL), will be later in Europe (region 2 DVD, PAL), and even later here. It's hard to wait, so I ordered my copy from Australia. The price was actually about the same (including postage) as what I'd expect to pay here. Multiregion DVD players with built-in NTSC-PAL converters are under $100, and I'd recommend to anyone getting other-region DVDs and using this type of a player."
5,Original Series of Starsky & Hutch is the Best,This is probably one of the best seasons for this series. Looked forward to watching D. S. and P. M. G. each week.
4,this was a cool show and season 3 was good,"back in the day i use to have my own Starsky and Hutch car with the remote control and i would spin it out. anyway season 3 as with the first 2 was good, alot of various topics and themes made there way and the storylines were well writting and balanced. Huggy Bear was always a stone cold trip. season 3 had some bumpy episodes and then they had some great ones. in between you catch alot of then up and coming actors and actress's doing there thing and getting on the ground room floor in performance. of course it would be cool if they offered a few more extra outtakes,etc.. however having the show is cool and it still holds up. starksy and hutch stayed cool and it went just right."
3,Colorful but unbelievable...,"Jazz Bird takes place in the 1920's in the midst of the prohibition. The story starts of with the murder of Imogene Remus, the wife of a convicted bootlegger. Her husband, George Remus, confesses as the killer but he seems like an unlikely suspect as he's always been deeply in love with his wife...During the trial their story unfolds a twisted and complex tale of betrayel and manipulation...until the end when you find out the truth about what happened to their relationship and the day of Imogene's murder.The characters are colorful enough to keep you reading but the ending goes no where. Entertaining but not dazzling. I give this one 3 stars..."
2,The Jazz Bird lays an egg...,"I have spent the last 3 months reading 4 dozen various mysteries and I have enjoyed every single one of them--until now. I found this book terribly confusing with the story jumping around between past and present and the assortment of characters. I thought that the character of Charlie Taft was very undeveloped and that he should develop a ""passion"" for the dead Imogene rather laughable. I could not understand why people had such sympathy for George Remus and was disappointed by the ending. Any book that I start, I force myself to finish. Many times I'm surprised halfway through. But I now wish I had bailed out on this book after a couple of chapters. It wasn't worth the time. I read in Holden's notes that he had two editors for this book. Perhaps that was a big part of the problem. This will certainly be my first and last Holden."
4,It Grew On Me...,"So I listened to Rain Dogs. And at first I thought it was the worst [money] I spent in my lifetime. But you really can't go wrong with Tom Waits. By the second listening, I was singing along. My family hates it, but I beg to differ. You get to like it after a couple of listens, and you have to admit, it's mighty good bed-making music. I prefer his experimental songs/dark caberet music, but his blues and rock and folkis good nonetheless. Does he have a mouthful of marshmallows?"
3,Not what I expected,"I think I came at Tom Waites from the wrong direction to really appreciatre this album. The first I bought was Blue Valentines, followed by Closing Time and Grapefruit Moon. I loved the dark moodyness of songs like Kentucky Ave and I hope that I don't fall in love with you. So when, after reading all your comments at Amazon, I bought Rain Dogs, I must confess to being a little disappointed. The music is inotative alright, and there is some excellent stuff here, 'Dimonds and Gold' and 'Midtown' ones I would pick out. But it is much harsher, brasher and rougher around the edges than some of my existing Tom Waites. Now this maybe my own loss in not appreciating Waites for what he really is, a brilliant and radical musician with out constrictions of style and presentation. But I just thought a word to anyone out there who may have trod the same route as mine, it's a good album, but not 'Closing Time II'"
5,Classic Waits,"This is a great Waits disc from start to stop-- favorite tracks include Jockey Full of Bourbon, Blind Love and especially Anywhere I Lay My Head. Really worth the purchase; highly, highly recommended."
5,Dang 'ol creepy carnival music!,"While I wait in agony for ""Blood Money"" & ""Alice"" to hit the stores in May, the best I can do is turn to the uncountable number of albums Tom Waits has already put out. Among the best of them is ""Rain Dogs"". Tom Waits, who has the voice of a 'Muppet' & a flair for genius as a writer, gives another top notch look at bottom-of-the-barrel characters. Right from the start of ""Rain Dogs"" we hear a blanket of jaunty tunes of all shapes, sizes, & colors. The title track is just one of the wonderful glimpses we get into Waits' world. Right from the 1st track, ""Singapore"", the listener gets to cavort & carouse & rabble-rouse alongside Waits' various nighthawks until the end. We even get to hear the original version of Rod Stewart's hit ""Downtown Train"". (Waits' version is better, duh!)I've never heard Tom Waits put out a bad album, but if you're looking for one of his best, ""Rain Dogs"" is it."
5,A masterpiece!,"A masterpiece. Tom Waits recording career can be divided into two sections (so far). The second begins with Swordfishtrombones, an experimental alblum using unusal percussion instruments. While I like much of it, Waits is obviously experimenting with new sounds and approaches.In Rain Dogs it all comes together. Great lyrics, a great sound, a unique voice."
3,Listen...,"I love Tom Waits, ever since ""I Don't Want To GrowUp."" What a rare gem! It's so hard to find rare gems that aren'talso lame. If you like Tom Waits, then check out Chris Black and theHoly Ghosts. (I just found out about this Austin, TX-based bandmyself.) Use a search engine to locate their very interesting website.Chris Black's old band was Shoulders, who were once ranked #2 onFrance's top billboards."
2,2 good songs,I got this cds because I have read all kinds of good reviews and only liked the songs clap hands and jockey full of bourbon the rest I think is complete junk those of you who are fans of tom if any of his other albums sound like those two for the whole album please let me know because I loved those songs.
1,rain dogs? huh?,"This guy is just a creep. He looks dead on the album cover and he sounds dead on the songs. Clap Hands? CRAP Hands is more like it, please!I don't know what happened to real rock and roll like Creedence and Skynnrd. This guy sounds like he passed out under a drunk piano.Real musicians like Keith Richards and Rod Stewart would be rolling in their graves."
5,Beautiful Music,"Tom Waits' follow up to Swordfishtrombones is a masterpiece. Lyrically superior than the Swordfishtrombones, also has something else in the mix. Three songs with guitar by Keith Richards of The Rolling Stones! The production by Waits is amazing as always. Favorites include Clap Hands, Cemetery Polka, Big Black Mariah, Diamonds & Gold, Hang Down Your Head, Time, Rain Dogs, Gun Street Girl, Union Square, Blind Love, and Downtown Train (would be later covered by Rod Stewart). Waits version is better to me because he sounds like he's looking for redemption when singing it. The music also seems better because of the guitar. But that's my opinion. The rest of the songs are also very good. Highly highly recommended!"
3,An Interesting Songwriter,"To be honest, I like 2 songs on this CD, Downtown Train- greatly saved by G.E. Smith's guitarwork- and Hang Down Your Head. Tom Waits's music is a bit too strange to work on any sort of pop level and for that he became a cult hero. His lyrics are certainly an avant-garde poetic interpretation of urban streets and are worth a second and third look. How he puts it to music is certainly tough to handle at times and even how he sings can be really rough. Still, Waits is a treasure, a special songwriter. He can weave through his rough vocals a certain storytelling quality that is undeniably strong and charismatic. Downtown Train is electrified through Waits vocals and Smith's guitars. It is hands down better than Rod Stewart's version. This album may lack a certain rock-pop quality, but what it does contain is a genuine character telling some great stories. Tom Waits is amazing, I can tell that just by this album."
3,Strong if not spectacular,"3 1/2As diversely experimental as anything he's done, Wait's often classic tweaks upon various genres bends in momentum only to its predecessor."
2,I truly do like Tom Waits,"But I think this album is extremely overrated. It just doesn't do much for me. Not too exiting. I dig BONE MACHINE and MULE VARIATIONS and I consider HEARTATTACK AND VINE to be quinessential Waits. But I'll only listen to ""Downtown Train"" and maybe one or two others before I've had it with this tedious album. Sorry if you'd prefer me to jump on the critical bandwagon, but it's my honest opinion."
3,A Classic never fades,"This cd is a classic ISB cd. It is not as good as previous releases but it is still a must have for all ISB fans. Mr. and Mrs. are and Creation are among my favorites. This cd is a departure from the norm and is a nice change of pace from the everyday folk singers releasing cd's now. ISB music still remains original and cutting edge, 30 years after it was released."
2,teensy disappointment,"Everything about this book is too little. The pictures, the maps, the print. Incredibly small font, maps that can be seen only via strong magnifying glass. No legends for the maps--you have to look through the teensy text for explanations. It would make a nice coffee table book for elves. Doesn't even have the heft of a quality book."
4,Ha,"To the guy below, this cd came out in 1970, Boris just coppied this cd's cover but with a double neck guitar in 2005.So please next time before you say anything think a bit."
5,2nd the Best.,"My first on Drake's 3 lone albums comes to be my favorite. Not as bleak and quiet as Pink Moon nor jazzy and plain as in Five Leaves. The songs can range from a light airy pop of Hazy Jane 2 to a dark but enlighting Northern Sky. The instermentals are a little comteperary with a flute guiding the songs along. But probably the warm guitar and and drifting piano that is on Poorboy makes it my favorite song. This album is great to by played on a cloudy chilly day,well probably all Drake's albums are superb for that partiular kind of day."
4,A solid album from one of folk music's more underrated artists,"For fans of Nick Drake, this CD belongs in your collection. In my opinion, it's not his best work (I prefer the more stripped-down tracks that are found on ""Pink Moon"") but it's a great and mellow acoustic album nonetheless."
5,Perfection,"Like Nick Drake's album, Pink Moon, Bryter Layter is also an unforgettable one. His lyrical and musical genius remains to be unseen in all of popular music today. As a poet, Nick Drake exploits the simplest circumstances of human existence and sheds new light upon them. From the somber instrumental opening of Introduction, any listener can feel that we are dealing with something out of the ordinary... pastoral moods, cynical insights, and ""The Greatest English Love Song Of Modern Times"" (NME) are some of the things you can expect to find on this fine piece of art."
3,Precious.,"To actually access the music of Nick Drake, you have to get past a lot of baggage: the biographical legend; the twee aesthetic, aptly signified by the blandly psychedelic cover, fey title and spelling; the voice, an adolescent-whisper-falsetto type thing when it's not trying to be Bob Dylan. Once you do get past all that, the album is a vaguely pleasant, if indistinguishable, wash of folk pop, with unexpected instruments - cello, piano, harpsichord, sax etc. - keeping things interesting (some of the songs sound like an earnest Divine Comedy). There is one stand-out track, however, 'Poor Boy', part-Jobim samba, part-Legrand French cafe pop, part-Stones gospel. Its pop melancholy suggests where Drake's true talents lay."
4,Drake's lightest touch,"Drake's second outing has neither the dark edge of his first record ""Five Leaves Left,"" nor the brooding emptiness of his magnificent ""Pink Moon,"" but the ensemble does some complicated and interesting stuff all the same. John Cale's presence definitely felt, giving the album a funky classical and jazz feeling."
3,UNOBNOXIOUS...,"This is so totaly relaxing that it takes actually a few listens to notice a few annoying things:- Nick can only sing in one voice- Nick can only write lyrics that convey one kind of feeling- Nick can only play the guitar in one particular way, and in one (quite particular) tuningHe has basically one style. I you like smooth, romantic but somewhat sad music, as I do once a year, this is a rewarding listen"
4,An Album With Many Different Musical Styles,"Nick Drake's second album is much more upbeat than his other albums.It's more produced than the others as well.These aspects make this very different from his otherwork,and it's not comepletely represantative of his workStill, there's plenty of great music.""Northern Sky"" is one of the most beutiful songs that he ever recorded,and it features some beutiful contributions from John Cale.""Fly"" has sincereand earnest lyrics, and he sings it in a similar way.""Hazey Jane 1"" and ""Hazey Jane 2"" are strange ,haunting and melodic,with interesing lyrics,yet they are different in many ways.Others,like""One of These Things First"",""Poor Boy"" and ""At The Chime Of A City Clock"" explore different lyrical and musicalideas.The many different songs on this album fit together well creating a feeling of melancholy and beautey"
4,An excellent album.,"This is a great album, and really got me into Nick Drake. Wake up on a Sunday morning, throw it in the CD player and enjoy."
4,Haggis,"If you celebrate the Bard's birthday in January and live where you cannot get fresh local haggis, or just like haggis; this product is a god send. A few minutes in a microwave, it is ready to join the tatties, neeps and roasted beef. Sadly, it is not the same if you want to ""pipe in the haggis"" and perform the ""address"", as it does NOT come in a casing. Somehow, carrying a Corningware dish filled with steaming contents (no matter how good) as opposed to a ""great sausage"" on a silver service would not have the same meaning. On the other hand, I have been able to get folks to try haggis in this format, who would never try the sausage style haggis. Somehow it demystifies it! Go figure..."
3,CARTOON SUPERMAN,"Cheapie cartoon video offers some nice muted color tones in digitally remastered episodes of ""Popeye"" and ""Superman"". Seven 'Popeyes' from the 1950s are less adventurous than earlier entries, but the two 'Superman' episodes from the 1940s offer cool cartoon noir with excellent drawing, color and animation."
3,Let's Check that House!!,"The book "" How Many Miles to Babylon"" is about a boy who is curious and enters in an abandoned house. Suddenly, very surprising things happen. I gave this book three stars because it is very slow, without emotion. Until about the middle there is nothing with a lot of excitement that you would really enjoy reading."
2,Maybe I'm missing something.....,"I have read the three previous books...loved the 1st, liked 2, and fell back in love on 3. However, this one cannot capture my interest like the previous stories. I don't think Donati did a good job of ""building up"" the relationship (much less the sexual tension) between Lily and Simon. They were just suddenly together, and did not even seem to like one another that much. Hannah's story is just too depressing for words! I kept hoping that something would bring her some joy in this book, but there was nothing! Even the romance between Eliz & Nathanial seemed dull....like it was something that had to be included, but she really didn't want to put much effort into describing it.I guess I will re-read some sections of the book to see if I missed something.....I find it surprising that everyone else gave this book 5 stars."
5,"Love this series, and this 4th book is my fav so far!","I am a huge Diana Gabaldon fan, so that is how I found my way to Sara Donati's series (beginning with Into the Wilderness). Fire Along the Sky is the 4th in the series, and I read almost the entire novel in one weekend! By now, I have truly come to know and love all the characters, and I just can't wait to see what happens next. I recommend this series!"
5,Book Review,#4 in the Into the Wilderness series of book and it was another page turner. Couldn't put it down.
5,Donati fan,"THe Wilderness Series is one of my favorites, and have enjoyed reading these books several times over. It is up there with Diana Gabaldon in my ""favorites"" list"
5,"Another great book, but with an ending that makes waiting for her next book painful.","I adore this series. I literaly read every second I could, and although I hate to criticize a book I like so very much, I did feel like she ends the book abruptly, but it's more to the fact that I wanted to keep on reading so badly. I can't wait for the next installment."
2,They could do better than this.,"I was very disappointed when I got this game for my birthday and after we played a few times we realized that these cards have duplicate questions. You'll see the same questions over and over and they are the exact same questions. There is only one box of questions, so it doesn't take long to learn the answers. Very disappointing - I wouldn't recommend it for this price."
2,Major Rip Off,"I can't believe they actually charge $35 for this game. There is only one box of cards. We are paying for a bunch of cheap new game pieces. Don't they know that everyone plays with their one of 6 ""original boards""? I think that they should just sell the cards (2 boxes please...most games do consist of 2 teams, do they not?), charge about 20 bucks for them, and still continue to sell the entire set if you are new to the game. But this is an insult to Trivial Pursuit buffs who have bought EVERY SINGLE GAME, (ok, not Lord of the Rings)."
3,"When in doubt, guess ""Lewinsky""","""Trivial Pursuit: 1990s Edition"" continues the recent trend of the Trivial Pursuit creators to develop games that appeal to specific, niche audiences. This game promises to ask questions from ""the most trivial of decades"", and it delivers. Similar to other versions, the 1990s Edition requires players to move around a board and collect pie pieces from different categories (sports, entertainment, technology, news, etc). Success in the game requires players to answer questions like: Who once said, ""a zebra can't change its spots""? And whose ear did Mike Tyson try to eat?The packaging of this game seems rushed. Only four game pieces are included and two (Computer Screen and Palm Pilot) look alike. The game also contains a very limited amount of questions, meaning die-hard players will run out fairly quickly. With more imagination and a deeper desire to put-forth and enjoyable product, this game could have been much better."
2,difficult questions,I ordered this for my 23 year old son who asked specifically for the 90's edition thinking he would know more about the 90's than the 80's. Well he was wrong - questions are way too hard even for myself. We tried playing it a couple of times and just get frustrated because we can't answer the questions without alot of guessing. We don't even understand some of the questions let alone answer them. We expected some challenging questions but they all are too challenging as far as I am concerned. All in all I would say we are somewhat disappointed with it.
2,Not what I expected,Thought this would be like the standard Trivial Pursuit game with questions from the 90's. Some of the question were ridiculous and too hard for my kids or even my husband and I to answer.
5,Love trivial pursuit,I grew up playing this game with my family and always hated that the game was out of my league. I love the 90s edition because its an era I actually experienced. I do wish there were more playing pieces - the set only comes with four.
5,Great addition to the Trivial Pursuit family.,"I like the durable metal box this version comes in. If you have any awareness for the news on a day in and day out basis, the questions are not hard, but, anyone who doesn't keep up with the news and current events may struggle with the answers. Many of the questions give clues to the answers if you are paying attention to how the question is phrased. I played it with my adult children and their spouses and it was as much fun as the original. Trivial Pusuit is still our ""family favorite"" game and this version is a great addition."
4,Definately the trivial decade...,"My boyfriend and I bought this edition since I was born in 1980 and he was born in 1974. I figured I'd know the 90s well enough to be evenly-matched with him. We didn't figure the questions would be so difficult, but then, I suppose we forgot that most Trivial Pursuit games are more difficult than other board games. We had fun playing with his parents, but the difficulty of the questions makes the game last a while."
2,not for instructors,"I bought this book hoping that it would give me a brief overview of infant development and then help me teach children to swim. I am an experienced instructor, but have limited experience teaching infants. This book providing only information on appropriate hold and introduction to water...not actual swimming. My studnets are 6 months old and doing floats with kicks and this didn't even come close to that level of instruction."
4,Good,"I ordered because we loce Castle and the lady who plays Beckkett is the star of this low budget film. She is younger and too thin, but a good actress."
3,Katic Fan,"I viewed to see Stana Katic's work.More story,less violence,more Katic would have been appreciated.. without Ms Katic why bother seeing Stiletto."
2,Stana is stunning,"but the movie is more like a ""straight to DVD"" movie. I could write better dialogue. There were situations that never went anywhere. Don't know if that's the director/ the editor/ or the writer's fault. Probably all 3."
3,Having seen the trailer & pics,"Dearest filmmakers. For god's sake, please employ Russian or CIS actors to play Russians :)This girl is as much Russian as I'm Japanese. I understand that Olga Kurylenko might be a little too expensive nowadays, however there must be many more over there.Or, if being realistic is not the case then slip the background stories and just do the Tarantino..."
2,Left me with an empty feeling,"I decided to purchase ""Twelve Stops and Home"" after falling in love with ""Sewn."" The album sounds reminicent to the likes of Queen, 10cc and such. There was something peculiar about the lyrics in the songs that left me wondering."
1,I Should Have Known Better,"After hearing The Feeling's performance at the concert for Diana, against my better judgement, i ordered their debut cd. Outside of I Love It When You Call, it is a pretty dull affair. Perhaps with a different engineer and producer, they might have sounded like a band comprised of living beings instead of zombies."
5,Pure Pop Euphoria,"This CD is like molten sunshine infused into my veins. Or a head-rush of pure cane sugar from a syringe. It has excellent harmonies, great layered vocals, and is so catchy you need a jackhammer to jar the melodies out of your brain. I don't normally like radio-oriented pop, but this album has excellent musicianship and the songs are incredibly enjoyable without giving your teeth a cavity. The first eight songs are delightful and even a little poignant. Even though I lean toward progressive rock and metal, I will definitely buy ""The Feeling's"" next CD, if only to get respite from the crunchy metal riffs that have caused permanent damage to my psyche. Listening to ""12 Stops and Home"" is enough to cure any amount of angst brought on by angry alternative bands, cell phone malfunction, or too much foam in your double caramel mocha latte crappuchino."
4,love it when they play,"A little bit pop, little bit ELO, little bit rock, little bit Queen, mix it all together get The Feeling. 12 perfectly crafted pop rock ditties that bring a little bit of the Seventies back into vogue, but with better production values. Fans of Brit pop rock should definitely give this group a listen."
5,Pure pop delight,"The purist, most delightful pop-rock in years, Twelve Stops & Home magically blends the best of boy-band melodies with rock sensability. Well-written, hard-to-shake tunes will have you wondering how good, say, a boyband like Backstreet Boys could have been if they wrote all their songs, played all instruments, stayed away from schmaltz and Muzak....okay, forget that comparison, that was never gonna happen, just pick up this disk and try to get it out of your head after a couple of listenings. I'm already looking forward to The Feeling's next venture."
1,"Lots of words, LITTLE REAL HELP!","The book appears to be weak in offering real help in configuring a Windows XP machine beyond the most obvious. For example, instead of offering step-by-step help on how to configure a Peer-to-Peer Network, the book goes into detail on how to plug in a NIC card and what the screens look like when its connected to a network, BUT does not go into any details about how to diagnose and configure the network connection by selecting the correct:1. Protocol2. Device configuration3. Other detailsfor a Peer-to-Peer network with other machines running Windows 95, 98, 2000 and ME."
4,Good Intro Book,"I bought this book for my father, who is getting a new computer loaded with XP. He is NOT a computer whiz and doesn't really want to be. This is a book for someone who needs a handy printed reference on XP basics, peppered with some useful tips.I looked at several of the other introductory books in the store and though some had friendly looking, brightly colored pages, none of them had the straightforward organization and succinct writing that this book offers; nor were they as comprehensive. It's very easy to find answers in this book!If you can get past the unattractive newsprint paper and don't mind the relatively small illustrations, this book will provide enough detail to point a novice in the right direction and help him quickly accomplish tasks without getting bogged down in lengthy descriptions."
2,Good for beginners,The book is good for overall planning of your system. If you are looking for the how-to for the more complex stuff its not the place.
2,"""I looked Up"" disappointing","At the time of ""Changing horses"" the ISB unfortunately began to exchange originality for decadence, and increasingly so. This record is an example of this - great songs combined with songs that never seem to end - making it difficult even for a seasoned ISB-fan like me. In fact, only two songs seem to lift themselves out of this pool of sound, and the record starts off with them. Heron's songs ""Black Jack Davy"" and ""The Letter"" are among his finest songs, but in the songs that follow even Williamson must have lost track of what he was doing. ""This Moment"" sounds alright, but the album as a whole suffers greatly from a lack of direction and a tendency to hold on to a format which was so gracefully introduced on ""Wee Tam & the Big Huge"". In contrast, I must admit that this album seems to have a lot of the original and hard-to-define spirit left. For true fans only.Hans Wigman"
2,"Nice fabric, but disappointing","It took awhile to get here. It was within the range predicted, but at the very end of it. The real disappointment came when my boyfriend (who I bought this for) opened it up and put it on. There was a hole in the pocket! Of course it's easy to fix, but a new product shouldn't be flawed.It was also a different fabric than I expected. Of course, I don't hold the company responsible for that. It's one of the chances you take when you buy something online and there's no close-up pic of the fabric. It was very soft fabric, but thin. I'd say it was more appropriate for summer.If you really want this bathrobe, remember to give it it's fully predicted shipping time to arrive and don't be surprised if something is wrong with it."
2,Not quite what I was expecting,"This book about the Magical Imagination is Nick Farrell's second book. He is now becoming quite the author.This second book bears many similarities to Shakti Gawain's book on Creative Visualization. But there are some real differences. This book draws on the magical tradition of the Golden Dawn, and emphasises this in a big way.All in all, this book is okay to read."
2,A reasonable attempt at a book about imagination,"But, however, as Elias Legolas has already pointed out, this book is very similar to stuff already available, and does not really give any new information.If there were no other books on this stuff (but there are plenty), then this book would be a good buy.I remain the artist - Joe Blow. Yours Sincerely in ""magical power""."
4,Empowering and Wise,An empowering and wise guide based on the refreshing idea that the qualities necessary for achievement are inherent in Latino culture.
5,"Tolstoy's ""Resurrection"" brought to film","This remarkable film directed by Rouben Mamoulian and starring the vastly underrated Anna Sten and the stellar Frederick March, is based upon Leo Tolstoy's unforgettable novel, Resurrection. The themes in this story revolve around the struggles that have plagued but ultimately elevated humanity since the beginning of time: how we may self-justify our own errors, blind spots and prejudices; the ability to self-reflect, modify our behavior, and hold ourselves accountable for our actions; to experience the transformative effects of remorse, apology and redemption; and the conditions under which we forgive. Of special note are the scenes illustrating the Russian Orthodox Easter liturgy, which are aesthetically, culturally, and spritually transporting. To begin to understand this film, see the Amazon page for Tolstoy's novel here: [...]"
3,o.k. movie,"I was disappointed, not much excitement. It just fell short of what I was expecting. I was sorry I had purchased it."
1,Interesting socialist propaganda from the past!,"This was the classic prototype of past socialist propaganda which adored Communistic Russia, was an apologist for the excesses of the communist regime, and could easily sway the idealists of that time or this time that matter. The KGB subsequently learned that a consistent subtle propaganda is more effective and believable than this movie's approach. This movie is not subtle in its message.The story line is obscured by the obvious propaganda. The story line is unrealistic and hard to believe. The photography and editing, especially considering it was made in 1934 are excellent."
5,A must for any collection!!!,"This masterpiece should be in any serious music lovers collection no matter what genre you love. This is quite simply one of the greatest records produced by anyone, ever. To call this is a masterpiece is as easy as saying the sun came up today and it will touch you on so many levels you can't imagine. This will get in your skin and never leave. If you can find fault with this incredible opus then your heart has stopped beating and you should crawl in the ground cause you've already died!!!!"
5,KRIS DOES IT AGAIN,"Although the voice has lost some of the growl, the feelings and symmetry of writing have not diminished one iota. These songs will touch you and make you think. Sad, joyous, controversial. Vintage Kristofferson, to say the least. Kris himself finally seems comfortable in his skin, and a couple of these songs reflect that. It's been a long time coming and he's worked for every minute of it.An unexpected bonus on this must-have album is the inclusion of THE FINAL ATTRACTION from the SONGWRITER soundtrack. It would be an inspired move on the part of the powers that be to release all of Kris' out-of-print albums as both new and old fans have the very Devil of a time getting their hands on them. Think about it, Killer!"
5,Best Album I've heard in a long time!,"Kris' voice HAS lost some of its strength over the years. I think you'll notice that right off. But there is an honesty and integrity to this entire album that makes it unforgettable. No bad songs, no 'cheesy' songs, just a man explaining the world and his unique view of it.This album spoke to me the same way many of Johnny Cash's ablums spoke to me. The music may have entered in thru my ears, but I 'heard' it in my belly. This album has caused me to reevaluate Kris Kristofferson and his place in music."
1,Dabbling in the occult,"If you're looking for a clear, concise guide to delving into the world of the occult, you've found it. Like most of the books in the ""Idiot's Guide"" series, it's easy to follow and practical. So why do I rate it one star? Because in this case, clear and concise instructions are a negative. It's like a book that gives great instructions on how to become a drug addict. I strongly suggest taking time to consider the dangers of communicating with demonic spirits before taking this leap. It's actually very EASY to communicate with demonic spirits, even without instructions. They WANT to communicate with you, but you can bet it's not to help you in any way! No one dabbles in the occult and comes out of it for the better. I have to assume that most readers interested in this type of book are open-minded. Why not try communicating with a much higher power to get true enlightenment and direction?"
5,"A wealth of info, a great buy!",This study Bible is one of the best versions out there. It is very easy to follow and understand. It has outlines and footnotes that allow you to apply each verse to everyday life.
5,Best book ever!,"This was my favorite book to read when I was little, and I still read it every Christmas! I love the story, and the illustrations are great. It's way more interesting than a lot of the more traditional holiday books. I know I thought it was way cooler than The Night Before Christmas when I was 6. I mean, an awesome monster in a cave who eats cake with whole apples baked into it? So much better than another reindeer story xD"
5,History That Helps You Understand the Headlines,"Although published before the current war on terrorism, this book's historical overview of the relationship between media and the American government during times of war is strikingly relevant to today's headlines. Military tribunals for civilians? Abe Lincoln tried that in the Civil War. Another intriguing element is the discussion of how suppression of the atomic bomb's development -- by both the government and the media -- led to not only an ill-informed public, but an ill-informed president and may have impacted the final actions of World War II.Filled with solid scholarly research, this book is still accessible to the lay reader and offers fascinating insight into our country's history. From the Revolutionary War to the Gulf War, it covers who, among journalists and politicians, took what actions in time of war; why they thought they were justified; and what impact these actions had on political, legal and military developments."
4,What is a pink moon?,"""None of you stand so tall / Pink moon gonna get ye all..."" as Nick Drake sings in his whispery voice in the title song to this album. But what does it mean? Only one thing gets us all, and that is death. Death came earlier to Nick Drake than to most of us, perhaps by his own hand, one night after years suffering from depression. So if the Pink Moon is death, why pink? Think of the folk belief about a crimson or blood-red moon. A blood-red moon is an omen of violence and death. But to a person who does not fear death, for whom life offers only pain, there is no shocking blood red there. It is a pink moon he calmly awaits, lovely and inviting. ""Yes, a pink moon / Pink, pink, pink moon..."""
5,hope for the future,"listen to this music to celebrate life. our time on earth is short. somewhere in the universe there is a special museum with all the artists and musicians who died before their time. They are still making music, nick drake runs the place!"
4,Take Drake!,"This is great buy because its very simple music. Basic soft vocals and acoustic guitar. Nick Drake is also a very good finger-style player too, so its not all ""strum, strum, strum..."" and heavy unnecessary instrumentation. This is likely one of the most UNPRETENTIOUS CDs I own.Great song writer with depth & passion and something to say. Nick Drake is the real deal if you want something that is genuine.This album is great!"
5,"No, it's really true","I have to admit I was skeptical about this. 28 minutes of a soft voice and acoustical guitar? Oh come on, there must be a thousand albums like that from unknown artists. In no way was I prepared to buy into the whole Nick Drake legend thang.But . . . it's really, really good. After one listen I couldn't get it out of my head. It's so skeletal it's hardly there, yet there's something extraordinary about it. Check it out."
2,Nick Drake is overrated...,"This album had such a reputation that I could not miss it. What I must say, this is not for people who enjoy bubblegum hummable top 40 tunes; or most other people I'm sad to say. The songs are tuneless, melancholic droning without any distinct structure. Pink Moon is the only redeemable track. Nick Drake the 'tortured' genius the legend has become intertwine with his music so that its not his talent alone, but the sad story of his premature death which has carried this decidedly mediocre record.If you're into depressing music then Elliott Smith offers much more listenable fare. At least his songs have beautiful melody, harmonies, instrumentals.etc."
5,A Special talent,"It's hard to explain to someone why you like Nick Drake. People either hear the unique talent or they don't. To say he has a cult following today is an understatement.In all his songs there is a soft gentle vocal wrapped around an intricate guitar arrangement. 2 of the better examples of this would be the title cut and ""Place to Be"". Listening to his music all these years later, it's hard to see how radio missed this wonderful artist."
1,A tear on the sun,"Apparently, a lot of modern young musicians have looked to Nick Drake for inspiration. That sense of despair, that sense of loneliness, irrelevance, that kind of thing... Maybe that's one reason why they walk around like tramps, loud-mouthed and stupid. The search for individuality has surely drifted into the hands of ignorant swine.By Pink Moon stage, Nick Drake had drifted into isolation and heavy depression. But the sound of Pink Moon is not crushingly depressing nor is it tediously claustrophobic.The album has an overall quality of sound. Some bits are higher tempo and, so, more uplifting. The instrument playing is precise, like Drake's voice, carrying the listener over desolate hills and stillwater beaches. I can't really pick out the highlights because it's like taking the chicks away from the mother hen.Pink Moon is worth more than a listen. It deserves to be thought of as a beautiful, melancholic, classic on anybody's list."
2,Where's the despair?,"I bought this CD in the expectation of being blown away by melancholy grace. (No, I had not seen the Volkswagen commercial, but I had read reams of reviews and comments.) The album, in fact, is slight. The songs are not concise--they're simply short (and some are simply inchoate). And the melancholy is vague and unpersuasive. I will stick with Belle and Sebastian."
5,Boycott Volkswagon,What a disgrace that such a passionate and powerful album would have one its songs bastardized by being used to sell a car. Whoever is responsible for this should be ashamed of themselves. STOP THE COMMERCIALIZATION OF ART! We are not free from the mind pollution of our commodity and consumption obsessed culture. Demand space free of advertisments before there is none left.
2,"Insipid, pedestrian","Granted, Nick Drake was an originator, but like the rest of his stuff, these songs are insipid, with that breathy voice of his, simplistic and boring. Pseudo-emotional. No verve or daring."
5,Gorgeous timeless music...,"I have this on CD, but it's pretty battered from over playing, and has a tendency to skip when I play it on my car stereo. What a treat to find this classic in MP3 format!What can I say that hasn't been said by an absurd number of reviewers? Sample Nick's album...you either ""get it"" or you don't. This is great ""driving"" or lazy around the house music. Sip some coffee (or chai) on your sunny porch & bask in the simple beauty of Nick's music...or share with someone you love... over a quiet dinner."
5,Missed Him in My Youth,"I missed Nick Drake in my youth (I am in my late fifties). My youngest son who plays the guitar and has a very eclectic library played him for me. His melancholy, intricate, complex use of the acoustic guitar and simple lyrics (In particular, I like ""Road"".) moves me. My only compaint is that ""Paracite"" sounds like ""Dear Prudence"" by the Beatles. The collection of music in ""Pink Moon"" is by far my favorite because it showcases Drake's guitar and voice and is not over-produced. This is not the case in Bryter Layter. I was dissapointed in the song ""Fly"", which in its original version, highlites his very intricate guitar work. In the remixed version of Bryter Layter, it is lost in the production. I would very much like to hear ""Way of Blue"" released on CD, but not if it ends up like ""Bryter Layter""."
5,Unfathomably Beautiful,"I first got into Nick Drake when I downloaded some tracks from Bryter Layter (also a great album), but when I first heard Pink Moon I was blown away. What this album lacks in length (28 minutes) it more than makes up for in pure musical brilliance. There is a lot to be sound for the beauty of one man and his guitar. For my money Drake is the finest lyricist of the 20th century; Parasite is my personal favorite from this album. Coupling his lyrics with his whispful yet powerful voice creates a feeling of honesty that seems so rare to find anymore. His guitar playing is absolutely exceptional, ranging from rhythm rich picking and strummng (Things Behind the Sun, Parasite) to the the plaintive sparseness of Horn. A truly masterful work, a must for any fan of the singer/songwriter genre. Actually anyone who considers themselves a true fan of great music should own this album."
5,Perfection in Melancholy,"My first impression of this album was pretty music, but not all that much more. After my second, I found myself thinking this is very pretty music, and more. And after my third I found myself compulsively listening to this album for months. Beyond Nick Drakes importance as an influence on many of the greatest bands and musicians playing today, Pink Moon is simply one of those albums that any self respecting music fan must own. I do not make this recommendation without a warning though. Pink Moon has the emotional density of only the greatest albums (Coltrane's A Love Supreme for instance), and listening to it will rout your emotional state to match that of the album. This is the power of music at its greatest potency."
5,Nick Drake,"Nick Drake's ""Pink Moon"" is a revelant today as it was two decades ago. His lyrics and melodies are haunting. The title track is now being featured in a VW TV ad. Funny, how a virtually unknown artist, long since dead, can have a small revival.Vocally, Drake ranks right up there with the best of them."
5,Hard to sum up...,"The is a profoundly moving album. Even more so if you are familar with Nick Drakes other work. His other albums are filled with sad beauty. This one is filled with despair. The voice of a man past cracking up. He sounds already gone. The music is sparse, the melodies simple, the lyrics hardly there at all. Why do I like this album then...it's hard to say - it fills me with sadness, makes me depressed...maybe it just reminds me that no matter how far down I go there's someone who has been further."
3,"Still ethereal, but the beginning of the end.","Nick Drake's final `proper' album is somewhat erratic, his detachment and alienation from the world around him becoming more apparent in this collection of short songs.The guitar and vocal sounds are different from his early pieces, often a little grating to my ears which prefer the flowing beauty of his earlier work. However, `Place To Be' is a remarkable piece in which the vocals seem somehow to both fit the music and be detached from it, because they start in an unusual place. This is quite deliberate as he is using it to help convey the lyrical theme of being lost, searching for a place to be. As is normal with Nick Drake, the material grows on you and the bluesy `Know' is appealing, but some of this album doesn't stick so well. A worthy addition for anyone already with an appreciation of Nick Drake but not the place to start."
5,More people need this,"I remmber the day clearly when I first heard this record. I was in a record store( Live music? in Berkely) and they had a listening section. The cover really fancied me and I decided to give it a listen. I fell in love with it from the first strings. I listened to the whole album and that day ""Pink Moon"" was in my head everywhere I went. I finally bought it and I still feel the same about this record. It has the imagaination of a Lewis Carrol work mixed with a haunting depression that Dylan could only reach a few times. In my life I have only met less than a handful of Nick Drake fans and one day I was cleaning my room and from the T.V. in the other room I heard ""Pink Moon"" and saw it on a car commerical. Atleast that gives me a feeling some people know Nick Drake. This album just does something to you inside. You'll just have to buy it and see."
5,"Pink Moon, 28 minutes seems much longer.",Nick Drake's music for whatever reason fell in to my lap a few years ago and really did have a deep resonance in their impact. Pink Moon happened to be the first listened to and have been enjoying its beauty ever since. Like other reviewers 28 minutes seems to be a very short album but with repeated listens and as his lyrical execution and unique guitar playing persuasion hit your soul you find the 28 minutes could be easily 280 minutes such is the strength of focus the listener can expect from Nick Drake.Highly recommended.
5,Very wholesome,"I feel very pure when listening to this. The album is a journey from start to finish and is meant to be listened to in order...to feel the experience he's trying to invoke. At first I read into this album too much 'cause of the whole thing about his suicide and all that....I feel like this guy was rather young but intelligent. There's only one song with accompaniment, Pink Moon...has a piano that I think fits. I revisit this album on and off and like the subtlety and woodiness and purity of the songs. They don't hook me with the usual writer hooks. His voice reminds me of Donavan a bit and he's been compared to Van Morrison..but I think that it's only the time style of his stuff...the arrangement have simularity...but that's about it. It's a great album. I love it. (sorry about the randomness)"
4,"Reminds me of a quiter, melancholy Cat Stevens","This album is pretty good. The singer's voice for whatever reason reminds me of a softer version of Cat Stevens, the music is slower, quieter and melancholy. The arrangements are just him and a guitar, with a bit of piano on the title track. If this came out today, it'd probably be labelled ""sadcore"".My only real complaints is that the album is a little short, and I felt there could be a bit more accompaniment. The piano on the title track is nice. That's just a matter of taste I guess.I enjoy this album nonetheless. It's relaxing and I enjoy going for a walk during the evening with this on."
3,don't look back,"not like a fine wine, closer to an aged cheese. all of these players are talented and creative . there is some great playing in general. so what is the ""problem"" the music is passe', anachronistic . fusion, synthi, conflated music, do not stand the test of time. all a la mode, no Grissel."
3,"Close, but not it","I almost got this figure because, unlike most of the figures in the Batman line that Hasbro is pumping out, this one is fairly close to what the character actually looks like it the cartoon. Not quite, though.Fortunately, there's one that's much better. I believe it's called the ""Spectrum of the Bat"" series, which is very similar to Mission Masters 4 (in that it has a Robin, a Joker, and several Batman figures). The Spectrum Robin matches the animated series design much better - the arms and legs are red instead of green, and the gold accents are gone. My only complaint is that, like this Night Fury Robin, the cape is cloth, which I personally think looks dumb on action figures, especially at this scale..."
4,Fifth Grade Broadcasters,You will enjoy this book as much as candy. Benjy and his great friends from school are radio broadcasters. Benjy's class are going to have an exremly hard history test. They get the questions from the teacher's desk and ask them on the radio to prepare for the test. They give weird prizes like turtle food. So read this book because it truly is as good as candy.critic:Kiersten
4,great CD!,"my roommate had this CD, and i thought that it was really good. i would definitely recommend it. one negative side to the CD is that all the songs seem to sound similar. other than that, all the songs are good. get it and listen to it."
4,WONDERFUL LENTEN READING,"FR. FRANK has written a very enjoyable and easy to use Lenten companion. His thoughts, which are tied to the Gospel of the day, put things into our lives as they are today (rather than 2000 years ago). His is a very humanistic approach and he includes himself as a participant in our Lenten journey in particular and our faith journey over all. I highly recommend this book and use it as an addition to Living Faith."
2,Does not handle bidirectional communications on app startup,"Two programs I use regularly send commands to an attached device (TNC)to initialize it and the device responds. When using this adapter, the data sent back and forth is corrupted and most of the characters are dropped. I have to send a CR one or two times to get the computer and the TNC in sync so the application will handle input from the TNC.Both programs work flawlessly with a legacy serial port and have worked with other serial-to-USB adapters (that use the FTDI chip) -- not this one.Inquires for assistance from Bafo have gone unanswered."
5,Beyond Enchanting,"Have you ever felt close to someone thousands of miles away? That's how you will feel while listening to this celestial gem of a recording.Each song on this CD will transport you to a melodic and lyrical state that will remain fresh and compelling no matter how many times you listen to it. Her voice is framed by the most unusually creative arrangements, and the instrumental voices of her accompanists seem to inspire her to greater feeling. There isn't a lemon in the batch. Every song represents a hallmark of mature acheivement. I guarantee her voice will haunt your dreams. Certain melodies will enslave your consciousness. If I could only have one CD from my Brazilian collection,I would choose FESTA. It is pure distilled love."
2,Burt's Bees Natural Remedy Kit,I was a little disappointed with the sizes of the product. I did not know it was a trial size. I thought the products were full size.
4,Essential reading for the Usagi Fan,"While I agree with others' reviews that this is not the best place to start, for someone like me who had previously read other, later Usagi installments, it turned out that this issue filled in some key back stories. If like me, you are already familiar with the characters Jen and Ino, you definitely will want to read Volume 4.In addition, the intro by Alejandro Jodorowsky provides an unintentional chuckle. Of Usagi, Jodorowsky writes, ""Rendered with a grace that verges on the miraculous..."". Hey Alejandro, it's just a comic book :-)"
3,Casting Her Own Shadow,The book was fine. I received it in a good amount of time. It was an old library copy which I didn't expect but in good condition and it was a hard back.
3,Good buy,"The product worked like a charm and did exactly what it was supposed to do. Easy to hook up and work on. Only minor issue was the linkage between the pressure hose from the bottle to the additional hose to the master cylinder (the product comes separately). In other words, there are two hoses that fit together with a metal fitting. Where the two hoses or fittings meet, it leaks slightly. Note, I've yet to use some pliers to try to make the install as tight as possible, but still- the fitting should be sealed tight enough to prevent this. The type of leak is very small drops. Seeing that brake fluid can really mess things up (ie paint, etc.) I just used an extra rag under that area to absorb the leakage.Everything else worked out great. I took off two stars simply because of the leak issue and the amount of cash I paid for the product. It could be a little bit cheaper for what it does."
4,"Perfect product, could use some upgrades.","This thing is great for bleeding, the only downfall is the shortness of the hose, and I would like to see a nipple you can hook up vacuum to suck fluid back though the line to avoid spilling in engine bay when you are done bleeding."
5,A BMW DIYer's must have item.,"There are ways around using this type of product, but the convenience for the buck is definitely worth it. Does exactly what you'd expect it to, but better. A concern I had before buying this was losing too much pressure too quickly. Once the system is pressurized and the bleeder valve is then opened (in my case it was the clutch slave cylinder on my 03 BMW 330i) a lot of fluid will exit before it loses too much pressure. This really is a one and done, one-person solution. I haven't bled the brakes yet, but I'm sure it will be a piece of cake. P.S. If you are having issues bleeding a BMW clutch it may help to replace the master cylinder (not just slave). This cost me about $60 for the part and took about an hour. World of difference! Overall very glad I bought this product and considering the universal adapter for my other cars."
4,Great for one person bleeding!,"Good item if you are tackeling a job alone and do not want to bleed the conventional way. Fill the container, screw on the cap and pump away. I bled my 2002 passat around 10-13 psi. No need for any more. Make sure to bleed in the following order from fartherst away to closest. Rear Pass, Rear drivers, front pass, front drivers. Other things to watch is the level of fluid in the bottle and any leaks.The only reaso for 4 not 5 stars is the coupling between the two sections of hose (brass) will leak if not super tightened. Had to really wrench mine to get it from not leaking. Otherwise, great product."
5,Great ... Used it for my e36,The item makes bleeding the brakes an easy process. It is a must-have for DIYers. can save you $200 on a brake flush.
1,"inferior product, leaks on first use",This thing leaks on first use. The hoses are not tight and the brake fluids leak everywhere under my hood. Lucky I put 3 towels around the brake fluid tank because I knew this would happen. Will not buy this again.
3,song title???,Does anyone know the name of the song when the 3 boys are driving to the dance with Stacey and he's smoking weed after he held up the store and then gets pulled over by the cops? That song should totally be on the soundtrack!
1,ripoff,"i'm deffinetlly over 13yr i said ""specifically"" send me the ""ADULT VERSION ONLY"" U sent me the g or pg. WILL NEVER BUY FROM U AGAIN."
4,Might want to wait,"I love ""Reba."" I can wholeheartedly recommend the whole show for being funny, having great actors, and supporting good values. If you've seen any of the show and liked it, you'll probably like the whole thing.I will say that it might pay off to wait to make this purchase. I bought seasons 1-4 for about $45 before season five came out. Season six will probably come out relatively soon, and the bundle then might be more worth it. Whenever you buy it, I say go for it. Also, in case you're wondering, there should be special features on each season. I got the entire seasons plus special features when I bought 1-4 together."
3,Good quick introduction to subject.,"This is a short simple explanation of the new discipline of 'Extreme Programming'. Fast to read, easy to understand. So much for the book. I have doubts about Extreme Programming, it seems either unworkable or something we already do anyhow (contradictory statement, i realize!)."
5,XP will change what is possible with quality software.,"XP redefines the relationship between software developers and their customers. Better said, it defines that relationship when up time now it has been characterized by tension and blaim. XP defines simple rules, and simple roles that allow for better communication and higher project success rates. XP gives Project Managers the tools to measure and manage a project. XP gives Software programmers the tools to deliver a higher quality product."
3,If you're really that curious about XP.....,"I would recommend this book to any software modeler-geek that just loves to read books about the software development process. Certainly XP is not a lazy alternative to UML. If you are new to programming I would pass up this book without a second thought. I do not care for XP, so I could'nt recommend this book to anyone but the serious, serious software development process GURU who wants to have read everything. But if you're really that curious this book will (try) explain it to you."
1,"This is a hacker guide to the old ""dive into coding"" extreme","This author is trying to destroy all the great works in object-oriented software engineering that was developed by the great methodologists (Booch, Jacobson, Rumbaugh, B. Meyer, Coad, Yourdon, etc.)This book is trying to bring back chaos and dive-into-coding hacks under a desguised name to make it acceptable. Make no mistake. This is no RUP or OMT or OOSE. This is an attempt to legitimize hacking and chaos that happened many decades ago.Don't waste your money on this and go read the books by Booch, Jacobson, Rumbaugh, Coad, Yourdon, Odell, and Meyer."
5,Very enlightened and enlightening,"I'm about halfway through this book and it is a joy to read. It is so beautiful in its wisdom and simplicity. Extreme programming seems to make a lot of sense as long as your mates area) Marginal competent,b) Don't think of pair programming as a struggle for dominance,c) Can accept criticism without throwing a fit that would embarrass a toddler.Regrettably, none of these traits can be attributed to the pair I currently work with, so this book has inspired me to look for a new job. But I know I won't find myself in the same position since this book has showed me the red flags to look for while interviewing."
2,Purely amature,"While ""Extreme Programing"" has a number of sensible suggestions, the net-effect of it is quite marginal. I read numerous positive reviews and was hopeful when ordering the book, but was rather disappointed in the end.The prose of the book is quite poor, almost to the point of annoying. Everything in the book is referred to as ""Extreme Programming"" or ""XP"" which really nullifies the term. The author also has very little support for most of his arguments, which leads a reader to wonder if some of the ideas presented are mere whim.If you don't already own this book, then save yourself the bother. There are a number of books along the premise of ""Extreme Programming"" which are much more useful in the end:""Rapid Development"" and ""Code Complete"" (both by Steve McConnell)""The Pragmatic Programmer"" (Andrew Hunt)."
3,"Radical zeal but concise, simple, courageous","No doubt the ideas brought forth in Beck's work will generate controversy. He writes as he preaches, simple and courageous. I read the book in 3 hours and am still thinking heavily about its message. Current technological advances may actually allow his approach to work but it will be a tough sell to any customer comfortable with current methodologies. Beck's zeal is contagious but it comes across as rationalization for the lazy way I want to code. Frankly, what he espouses could be downright dangerous (not courageous) if the test bed environment is not extremely robust. I would have loved more facts and figures behind the one-paragraph arguments. I agree with other reviewers, this is just a large article, not a book, but oh does it generate some radical thoughts!"
3,anecdotal and sometimes silly,"XP has some good ideas, but this book could have been reduced to a paper by removing some of the silliness and the many anecdotes."
1,Where's the beef?,"Chapter after chapter I kept thing that the author would get to something substantive. He never did. Not one example. Not one piece of concrete evidence. He had some good common sense ideas, but they are all presented in such general terms that they are self-evident. The author makes grand assumptions and goes on to explain (in generalizations) his theories which are based upon these assumptions. I often envisioned the author standing on a street corner proclaiming the end of the world or espousing the ""scientific"" basis of creationism while exposing his complete misunderstanding of science and his willingness to ignore facts that disprove his assertions. This entire book is written as if it were an introductory chapter. It reads like a psychology text - a lot of verbiage which hides the fact that the text has almost nothing to say."
1,Poorly written,The book is a summary. Too many assumptions are made of the components involved in the XP model to give the readers a good base to use. There are some good ideas but not enough to actually implement the process.
3,OK general summary of XP,"I find the authors style rather long winded. I wish he'd get to the point and not be so chatty. The book provides a good high level, but very general overview of XP.If you want to learn what XP is about this isnt a bad book. It doesn't take too long to read.Many reviewers have rated this book poorly because they dont agree with XP. Thats a seperate issue. As a book it fulfills its purpose and explains XP. Be aware that these XP books tend to regurgitate a lot of similar general information. If you read the others in the series (as I have) you will be disappoined with how little additional information they add."
5,Great book and a Successful Philosophy,"Beck's book is an outstanding summary of a great development practice. I picked up his book for no real reason, but was so compelled by the arguments, that our little software development group implemented (most of) his suggested practices. Naysayers can say what you would like - 5 appplications and 5 contracts later, our company is growing, the customers are happy, the applications are in widespread and increasing use. This book describes a revolution built upon common sense."
5,brash new approach,"Just the testing and integration technique alone is worth the price of this book! As he says, this is probably the only part that you can take by itself. If you don't read anything else in this book, read the parts that have to do with testing and integration. These 2 elements are the cornerstone of his entire approach. The rest depend heavily on each other and must be taken as a unit.The theory here is exceedingly simple, but just like dieting, it takes discipline and persistance, and (as he intimates) maybe even sacrificing an odd person that won't ""fit"" with this management philosophy. Although I would probably not copy every stylistic element of Beck's approach, this makes a lot of practical sense. He is realistic in that this is geared toward a somewhat narrow audience with medium-size teams."
4,Anti-Methodology Culture Formalised,"I have been writing software for 17 years and now realise the past 10 years were cursed by the rise of formal methodologies.This book provides useful ammunition so that programmers can protect themselves from the chattering classes of the IT Industry and get on with the job. No doubt the Rational Rose crowd will spend millions of corporate dollars in an effort poor scorn on the title.The ideas presented in this book will be debated for years, let's hope more skilled communicators take up the Extreme Programming baton and publish further titles.One star dropped due to the shallow presentation and poor organisation, but then a well-structured book from this author would have been almost disconcerting!"
3,Lost treasures on the old spanish trail,very good reading and research that was conducted for the book seems to be above average interesting chapters on old lost treasure mines though out the west
3,no cross platform networking support,This is a great printer for the price. I got a deal at target for $50. It has photo quality color print on photo paper and the black is clear. My only problem is this printer is relies on a host computer to supply its information. This means that if your computer is slow or has little memory the printer will frequently stall. Also I installed it on my iMac and it won't share with a XP pc. I emailed tech support and they suggested a Lexmark print server for twice what I payed for the printer. And if you try to print hundred page files you'll run out of ink fast. But refil kits work but leaves a grainy print.
1,A disappointment over and over again,"I bought this and loved it at first. Then one day it just stopped working. It was stuck in a frozen state. So I called tech support and they replaced my machine. This one had the same problem when I took it out of the box! So now we moved onto the third machine, which seemed to work at first to my relief. One week later, the same problem again! This time, instead of wasting my time and patience, I just put it in the trash and now I'm shopping for a new brand. Beware; there is something wrong with this model. It's a great design but obviously it hasn't been perfected yet."
4,Can't beat it for the money,"I just setup this all-in-one and it was very easy. It is very quite. I have another color printer (Epson) and a laser (HP) and they are both louder than this one.The quality of the color is great however I haven't been able to get any images I print to be crisp. The images come out perfect on photo paper though. Small text looks great. This is good if this will be your only printer. I usually print with the laser, but this would be a great alternative if the laser every went down. The text is better than my New Epson that cost lots more.I bought this all-in-one because of the copy and scan features. I was replacing my scanner and this was a good deal so I went for it.I am impressed and feel I have spent my money well.I gave it a 4 stars because I would have liked to have a legal sized scanner/copier bed and color images don't prnt crisp enough on plain paper. (FYI... I already tried to fix the blurriness with the alignment tool.)"
3,"Documentation is lacking, otherwise quite nice","This printer is amazingly quiet and crisp, I have no complaints about it, especially for its price. I also have a Dell A940 multifunction printer (in reality, its actually a Lexmark X5150) and that is much noisier and more expensive. My problem with this printer was with the installation. I installed it on a PC running Windows 2000 Professional and the scanner would not work. After trying all Lexmark's troubleshooting suggestions, I went to the Lexmark web site and found that the drivers supplied with the printer/scanner do not support Windows 2000. I had to download a new setup from the website and once I did that, everything worked. There was nothing in the documentation that suggested the operating system I'm running on this PC was not supported and that would have been such an easy thing for Lexmark to do, it would have saved me a couple of hours of angst."
5,All in one,"This Lexmark multi task printer is a great choice- it takes little desk top space and prints/copies/scans in black/white and in color.I use a Sony VAIO with windows xp. The set up of the printer itself was easy and came with clear easy to follow instructions. The software CD guides you through the installation process and then you are ready to go..easy to use, easy installation. Great for beginners and a great value for your money."
1,What a mess!,"I purchased this printer because of the good reviews but after I tried out the printer, the black only worked for a little bit. I replaced the ink cartridge and it still had problems so I returned it for a new one, same model. The new one seemed to work just fine and then after about a month of use, once again the black ink printed only small streaks every once in a while. We tried one more and went through the same thing and finally bought a different brand all together."
3,Slobber Jet,This is as good as the price but it uses a lot of ink and copys are not what they should all in all it is good for the price
3,perhaps overrated,"I live in Europe but visit New England most years. I first use my European moss flora and quite often I arrive at a good result. For the remainder I use Conard's how to know your mosses and this Crum and Anderson classic. I miss a universal key, you have to know the familiy. The drawings look really great and are very detailed but in my experience don't draw the eye easily to the important details for the species. The descriptions are very helpful once you arrived at the right name."
2,"Okay, but nothing special",Mr. Chowdhury's writing is quite dry and I didn't get much out of reading this book. I was quite disappointed after hearing so much from others.
4,It's good.,"I eat it because I can't eat wheat, oats, or rye. Also, most outs are contaminated with wheat oats or rye. It tastes good, for what it is."
5,Very satisfying,"A good gluten-free meal. I mix in almonds and fruit and it's a good meal. As with most gluten-free foods, there isn't much in the way of vitamins, so make sure you add what you need."
2,not very tasty,"I know this is supposed to be healthy--but it's not tasty at all..and to keep it healthy, you wouldn't want to put sugar, or cream on it!"
1,disgusting mush,"This stuff is absolutely disgusting!!! It cooks to a mushy texture and is kinda like cement, with a slightly better flavor. I does not have any resistance like oats or other grains. It says creamy buckwheat cereal....description sound really good!! Do not buy it unless you like mush!"
2,Many Inaccuracies,"Unfortunately I can not recommend this book. I used to welcome books about James Bond because they were far and few to be found in the world of publishing. This book falls into the plethora of recent publications about Ian Fleming's creation. Being part of that trend this book carries the stigma of glaring inaccuracies when it tackles Ian Fleming's written word. Many authors do not do their homework and the research into the actual words that Fleming put to paper. Fleming's sublime knowledge into the world of espionage, esoteric life styles and curiosity pieces is something analogous to the riddle of the Sphinx because in many instances the reader either misunderstands Fleming's prose or the reader just glosses over his words totally oblivious to the intent Fleming implied. Hell's belle's."

3,"GOOD, BUT ...","Good, but kind of nonsense. Savage Art is much better than this book because the thriller and the characters are better established and linked. By the way it`s a good entertaining and I would try other books from this author."
1,Not good!,"This book was falling apart in my hands when it arrived, which I was not aware of but the price was very low so I didn't bother returning it but just recycled instead."
3,Loud-- Put it in your mouth!,"Alec Empire proves that the noisier the better. I didn't think they'd have it in 'em after their last blast, but ATR comes back stronger than ever, as if they're floatin' on weed!!! The power ballads are the only flaw... I mean, is ATR thinking that it's like the new Journey or something?"
1,"brings the noise, leaves the music behind...","Quite simply, Atari Teenage Riot is so bad it's good. Almost. The music is terrible, not just performance-wise, but recording quality, too. It sounds ATR leaned a Fisher Price cassette recorder up against a blown amp and then cut thier album. But, I guess that's part of ATR's charm. the lyrics are almost completely incoherent broken english, but honestly are fun to scream along to and make fun of. It's hard to believe this is a real band, but I love them anyway."
4,The Non-conformist Force of Angry Raver Youth has RETURNED!,"ATR IS BACK!!!!!! While there are lots of similarities between this album and Burn Berlin Burn, many of the trax are dustier and harder --- lots of horror-movie screaming, harder and faster -- jumpy, too, kinda like this review. The missing star is for the lack of slow and thoroughly comprehensible trax like ""Sex"" which appear on Delete Yourself! (1995) and Burn Berlin Burn. ATR isn't exactly well-known for its slower recordings, but we DO know that Hanin Elias can do more than scream :)The sequel to the original ""ATR"" (Track 4) is just as good, but maybe not single material (although it'd be cool). ""Ghostchase"" (my fave) and ""Too Dead For Me"" are prolly the best contenders.Atari Teenage Riot fans, buy right NOWWWWW!!!!!(if you're new to ATR, though, Burn Berlin Burn's prolly your best bet.) :)"
3,This is what I think.,"I like the previous albums better. It sounds too damn clean this time around. Other problems with the album: The slogan chanting (""Throw your fists up...blah blah"") is much more cheesy than on the other previous albums. Also, this album has a very pop feel to it, which is also annoying. ATR going pop is like Iggy going classical. I can't wait until they tour, though. I'd be curious to see if their live show falters as much as 60 Second Wipe Out does. PS I like Nic Endo's noise on the album. I just wish her sound was more discernable in the mix."
3,Atari Teenage Chaos,"While I feel this album shows much tallent, it also shows they need much work. I am a fan of ATR and would like them to get rid of some of the background noise in their music. It is way to chaotic at times and is nothing more than pure noise, and while I like some noise this just gets plain annoying at times. Keep it up you are the cutting edge of music and I will eagerly await your next album. They have consistently shown improvement and I can only see them getting better."
5,Best Secret Spice in your Pantry,"I absolutely love this seasoning. Best on seafood such as tilapia, shrimp. Melt a little butter and/or olive oil add Citrus Grill to taste and broil/grill. I'm so glad that I can now purchase this thru Amazon. Before this, I could only find it at Sam's Club and my membership is now expired."
5,She does it again,Lexa Rosean is more of the most talented writers around. This book is great. This is a must have for your library. It is really easy to understand. Just get it. You'll love it.
3,disappiontment,"this cd I expected to be decent because Too Short was one of the producers, but it was a total dissapoint ment. they need some real beats. stick with ""Can't stay away"" too short fans"
1,How can a cable fail?,"It worked for a few weeks, then failed. No physical damage - it just stopped working. I've never seen a cable do that before."

1,"""Valuable travel information""","Rand McNalley states under their folded map description, ""and valuable information."" However, when they made the map, they must have run short on ink. They forgot to put in any milage or distance information. As a traveler, the first information one seeks, is how many miles is it? The milage information allows one to determine, fuel stops, lunch breaks, time to location and overnight stays. Without milage, the map is useless to the traveler. Sorry Rand McNalley, I would have given you zero stars, but it was'nt available."
5,A simple yet charming story,"Marvelously written by Julie Sykes and splendidly illustrated by Jane Chapman, Dora's Chicks is a wonder-filled color picturebook for children, about a mother hen doing her best to keep track of her six chicks - but one has gone missing! The hen and her brood travel all about the farmyard, from animal to animal, asking each one about the missing chick. A simple yet charming story especially suitable for reading aloud to young people, Dora's Chicks is enthusiastically recommended for family, school, and community library picturebook collections for young readers ages 3 to 7."
1,another book about counting,"The dialogue in this book is pretty pathetic, and the characters are lame, like Bobby the Bird. Give me a break. The illustrations could have been done better by a sixth grader.Don't buy this book unless you want to be bored out of your mind every time you have to read it to your kids. Although, your kids will probably find it just as dull."

5,"Incredible, Complete..a must read for all Dane fanatics","As a lifelong Great Dane owner, I have read them all. This is by far the most complete book I have seen yet...and a joy to read. It will be included in all my puppy packets for future litters as the most complete ""instruction manual"" I could hope to find."
5,Century Is Improved,Century has an improved regulator which provides constant light output in cold weather or when the cylinder gets low on fuel. The 7215 model puts out more light than my Coleman 2-mantle propane and gasoline lanterns. It is compatible with an extension pole which allows you to use 20-pound (5-gallon) tanks. The extension pole also has two other outlets so I can have a hot plate and heater operating at the same time. The hard case is also superior to Coleman soft cases.
1,"Horrible, Pretentious Environmental Psychobabble","DO NOT waste your money or your time on this video. The only reason I didn't give this drivel 0 stars, is because it wasn't an option. If this movie is supposed to be about the influences that shaped J.R.R. Tolkien's writing, it is seriously lacking in some of his most fundamental influential elements: Tolkien's devout Catholicism, Tolkien's friendship with Oxford colleague C. S. Lewis and Tolkien's family life (the fact that he wrote much of his material for his wife and children) are completely ignored. Instead, the folks at National Geographic seem to have opportunistically decided to glob onto the success of the Lord of the Rings movie in order to push a left-wing anti-capitalism environmental agenda. For sheer pretentiousness, the ending in which we are asked the rhetorical question ""Who will be the ringbearer?"", takes the cake - it sure sent my gag reflexes into overdrive."
2,Boo,"2 Stars is all this CD will get. If you are a serious Tolkien fan, you will know that the content has a lot of twist and stretch. For one thing, it says Tolkien began writing LOTR after 1939, but Tolkien was already writing it in 1937!! And the CD also draws lots false connections between the book and Tolkien's life: Gandalf's visit to Minas Tirith to discover Isildur's scroll is like how Tolkien had discovered Finnish?? But most of all, this CD (and even Peter Jackson!) keeps linking World Wars to LOTR. How insulting!! The only reason that this CD does not deserve trashed is because it also has some rare photos of Tolkien. And what has that rain-forest guy got to do with LOTR? Just because he also read the book and started a journey to save the trees?? Give me a break!!"
4,It'll hold you over for a while,"This DVD provides an interesting, concise look into Tolkien's eternal epic, 'The Lord of the Rings.' Interviews with people who knew Tolkien as well as the stars behind the new movies (including Peter Jackson and Elijah Wood) tell the story of the man behind the legend. An educating and entertaining movie- this is worth the money because of the movie footage alone. I only gave four stars, however, because the program does go off on a typical National Geographic tangent about saving the rain forest at the end. Like I said, this may be enough to hold you off for a while until the movie comes out- rumors now claim August 6."
1,"Horrible, Disgrace to Tolkien","Having read ""The Lord of the Rings"" and being a large Tolkien fan I was sickened at how the makers of this video tried to twist Tolkien's visions into their own independent agenda. Tolkien outwardly warns against this type of misinterpretation at the beginning of ""The Lord of the Rings"". I used to have a very high opinion of National Geographic, but they've really let me down here."
4,cultural background for epic fantasy,"When I saw this tape, I wondered how National Geographic could review what essentially was an epic fantasy stressing good v evil and friendship. They have done an excellent job.The video explores three points. First, how the degradation of industrial England destroyed the environment of small village life. (a typical Geographic theme: Ecology).Second, the effect of World War I on the fantasy, mainly in the battle scenes. Readers of LOTR know that one of the major themes is that the heroes do not seek glory on the battlefield, but when it is required, they do indeed heroically fight. It also points out how the war democratized Tolkein's view of the then stratified British society.Third, it points out the roots of the fantasy in Finnish poetry.For those who dismiss LOTR as a childish fantasy, this exploration on the cutural and intellectual basis explores why this epic tale has such a hold on so many people of different backgrounds."
1,LoTR Fans: Save Your Money,"This is getting one star because you can't give it a half star.The worst part about this DVD is that it doesn't do a good job at masking the fact that's its not really educational- it feels more like a long winded commercial for the movie. It hits on historical bits and points here and there but never goes into much detail. Additionally, it just seems to wander from point to point without a lot of structure.Sleep inducing, really.Save your money.LoTR can easily sell itself without the help."
2,Completely misses the point of the story,"The writers of this review appear to be more interested in advancing an agenda than reviewing the story. They draw allegories with World War II, which Tolkien specifically rejected; Tolkien hated allegory. The writers relate the story to deforestation, which is also completely forced. The discussions of Beowulf and the Kalevala are interesting, and the movie clips are good, but overall this DVD is a waste of money."
1,how disappointing : - (,"Thanks for this DVD. Now we all know at least that the background of ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the world war and no longer just a fantasy story. Endless scenes of fighting, bombing, Hitler (Sauron), factories, soldiers and all this between Germany (Mordor) and the rest of the world (Shire) is never ending.J.R.R. Tolkien made clear that he had the idea with the ring, the fight, between good and evil in his head before the war even started. The whole story is strongly linked to the hobbit.All I can say ""what a waste of money!!!"" If your a real fan of the movie please don't buy it !!!!!!!"
1,Insipid,"The DVD reminds me of a high school term paper. It draws shallow and insipid analogies between the environmental movement and the two World Wars with Tolkien's work. The environmental ""spokesperson"" seemed particularly out of place.The only interesting part of it is on the historical background of Middle Earth's Elvish heritage.It's a shame National Geographic released something so blatantly without intellectual merit or interest. Buy it, if you want to reward this behavior."
2,See the infamous car-in-the-background scene!,"Is this documentary worth watching for its literary or environmental value?Heck, no!But, if you can get a hold of it for free, it is worth watching to see the car driving down the road behind Frodo and Sam.That's right! Remember the big thing about a car in the background of FotR?Well, it's true (the producers make reference to it in their audio commentary for FotR).However, nearly the only way you'll ever see it is in this documentary, b/c the scene was ""fixed"" for the DVD release of the film.If you don't know, it's the scene when Frodo and Sam are leaving the Shire and Sam notes that he's never been that far away from home before.It's silly, but fun."
2,Commentary Behind the Scenes,"This is a look at what went into making The Fellowship of the Ring movie by Peter Jackson based on a book by J.R.R. Tolkien. How Middle Earth was created, good vs. evil, -places- heroes- villains in Middle Earth. Who are the real life Frodos? Looks at the lush New Zealand and U.K. landscapes the film was shot at. I thought it was a parody of the sword and sorcery genre and its cliches. I've seen them all, but wouldn't rate them beyond mediocre."
2,"Not worth buying, but worth a rental","I received this as a gift. Pretty hard to impress me with something Tolkien related, I've read the main books at least 3 times each, the entire 12 volume History of Middle Earth series from Christopher, the entire Tolkien Studies series from West Virginia University press, and numerous others. This would be good additional information for anyone that was a fan of the Peter Jackson trilogy, but if you're the type that's as far into Tolkien as having read the Silmarillion, this will disappoint. For many I'm sure the information about the rune singers and the Kalevala is info you might otherwise not find unless you read some of the more esoteric of Tolkien histories, so rent it for a night (there's hardly an hour of content here) but don't buy it."
3,Background viewing,Interesting for background information about the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Nothing like as good as seeing the actual film Peter Jackson has produced. I'll revisit it when the Two Towers and Return of the King movies are completed and the DVD's & VHS's are out.
3,"Interesting, but not what I expected!","I really bought this video, as I missed the making of lord of the rings on tv, and thought that maybe this would give me an insight. It did have some clips from the actuall film, but it is more about Tolkins life! So I wouldnt recomend it if you are a fan of lotr and want to see what happens behind the scenes, as that is only part of the beginning bit, and some references towards the film in other parts. If your a fan of Tolkin, then get this vid! But I was a little dissapointed!"
2,Better rental than a purchase,"I purchased it with high hopes that it would really give some good insight about how Tolkien came up with the LOTR. Unfortunately, the insights were rather weak. It was really well researched, but there were no interviews with Tolkien of any kind. One would have thought that some insight from Christopher, his son and editor of the Silmarillion, would have been included in this, but it wasn't.There was never any mention that the story of Bilbo Baggins was a story he told to his kids, and because they liked it so much, he began to write it down.I found out more about Tolkien by reading the CD sleeves of the radio dramatization of LOTR (ISBN 0553456539) than I did with this DVD, I feel completely jipped.If you want to see it, I recommend renting it. It's not worth adding to your collection."
5,Storytelling as it ought to be,"I thought they didn't make them like this anymore.I very rarely buy short story anthologies because they so often do anything but tell a story.Dick Hammond is different, and every one of these stories was utterly enjoyable, and a view into a forgotten time and place. The last story, ""The House by the Talking Falls"" is unique, possibly the only example of West Coast Canadian Gothic in existence! It can stand proudly next to any Edgar Allan Poe or M.R. James."
2,This book wasnt my favorite book,"This book wasn't the greatest book in the world. I read it and it didn't make much sense, the author just kept repeating himself and the concept never concluded, Clifford just sucked some cat through a tube and all of the sudden the neighbors loved him, unbelievable. If everyone in the whole town liked Clifford why wouldn't these neighbors? Clifford should've just went into his giant house and not bother the old people, instead of trying to gain friendship. I would recommend it to younger people but not teenagers 15 and up, they should read something like Spot, its much more interactive.So I rate it an overall 2 out of 5."
1,"Pinnacle's slogan should be ""This is idiot proof software""....","The fact that you purchased our software after several hundred 1 star reviews is proof that you're an idiot (high five). I tried using the trial version with Vista, no-go. Vista didn't like it so I called the sales dept at Pinnacle and the sales guy said that the full version was compatible. After going back to Pinnacle's website I read where the latest version was beta, it might work with Vista but we're not sure and by the way it's not supported by Pinnacle. So I loaded it on another PC with XP and it took 45 minutes to install, then 2 minutes to start up and 2 seconds to crash. Uninstalled it and sure enough it hosed the SQL server version that XP installed. So even the free trial cost me a lot of my time which I don't consider free."
2,Too much pain in using it,"The product is good in features, but very unstable. It crashes easily. Good to play with for kids, bad for serious users who want to edit videos."
1,Buyer Beware,"Don't buy this product. After several attempts, and multiple packages of software, this product did not load on a computer that met all the system requirements. We tried phone support, and that was as poor as the product. Look elsewhere."
1,What is up with this program,"I downloaded the trial version 10 from their website. Installed it, rebooted, ran it and got a trial version has expired message. Uninstalled it and rebooted. Reinstalled it and rebooted. Ran it again and got the same message along with it locking up and asking me to fill out an error report. I did and clicked ok and got a message to go to control panel to setup an email account to send the message........!!!!!!!! Uninstalled it and rebooted and moving on with my life.....GOODBYE PINNACLE!!!!"
4,"Most intuitive editor, only with HD, and fast","I've been using Studio for years and while I definitely had reliability problems with Studio 10.0, 10.6 has been very reliable, and beta testing 10.7 shows me it is just getting better. I tried Premiere Elements but it was much harder to figure out how to do things, and it was much slower burning a simple DVD image, and it simply doesn't do HD which I've started playing with. I'm sticking with Studio and I make a DVD just about every week with my kids' videos. I do recommend that you have a good system that is fairly clean."
1,From good to bad,"I've been a user of Pinnacle version 8 (which I loved), and needed to update to a version that could burn dual layer DVDs. What a disappointment this ""upgrade"" has been. Crash after crash. What is most disappointing is that Pinnacle built in a feed back system so the users could ""help"" them develop a better product. This means to me that they knowingly released bad code, and used their customers as guinny pigs while sticking us for a $100. Guess what, I don't want to help Pinnacle build a better product. I want a product that works when I purchase it.Lesson learned. Next time I read a bad review on a product, I'm staying away."
1,Pinnacle or Nadir?,"Among stiff competition, this has to be a contender for the worst software ever, particularly in its price category. Almost nothing works, options are preset and cannot be changed. For example, if you use a separate HD you cannot select it as an option. Forget about the monikers 'plus' and 'special' with 'extras'. If the package I got indeed comes with 'extras' the bare-bones software must consist only of an opening screen that says, ""got you sucker...one born every minute"". The software is counter-intuitive, doesn't actually work and it is very time consuming to establish this. If you bought it, uninstall it, toss it and cut your losses and buy something else. This will drive you to drink."
3,Pinnacle 10.5 seems better than Adobe Elements 3.0,"I haven't bought this software -- yet. But I have downloaded Pinnacle's 30-day trial version and I've been working with it side by side with Adobe's 30-day trial version of Premier Elements 3.0. I am finding that Pinnacle Studio 10.5 is much more intuitive and easier to use than Adobe's offering. It also seems to have better and more special effects and transitions. Since I want to be able to integrate still photos with videos (from old home movies, a BIG upcoming project), I like Pinnacle's ability to pan and zoom on stills, a la Ken Burns. I haven't had any problems with Pinnacle on my Windows XP PC, which has a 3 ghz processor, 1 gig of RAM and a 128 MB video card. That's all I can tell you about it at this point, but it does look like a winner to me."
4,Easy to use once I cleared up the firewire problem,"Hi,I've been using Pinnacle Studio since version 8, didn't do much with 8 or 9, but went to version 10 when I really had a lot of video to edit and put on DVD. 10 crashed alot, mostly to do with capturing, and I went through a lot of updates etc, but nothing seemed to help, until I switched to a combo firewire and analog capture card, and my problems all went away. There was something about the integrated firewire port and driver on my ASUS motherboard that didn't jibe with Studio. But with the combo card firewire port, everything is working fine, and I really like the ease of use, i'm getting to be an old dog and new tricks are difficult."
2,The Consensus Is: They Blew It!,"Yes it's true, the bonus material is better than the actual feature. This type of editing is getting very dated and I think it impresses no one. I repeat what many have said:1. Good music, performances, and sound quality but so irritating how interviews intrude on the performances.2. Headache inducing rapid fire edits that rival the movie Catwoman, band members somehow change guitars in the middle of songs, visuals don't match what's heard, producers show no affinity for the music.3. Too many shots of the crowd, many of which seem to be planted strippers, etc.The people that made this show just should have let Aerosmith and the music do the talking. This hard-sell editing seems more suited for an up and coming boy-band or somebody else that is trying to establish itself and create hype. This DVD should have tried to please it's established fanbase and given them a pure concert video. If only the feature was more like the songs in the bonus video material!"
3,Too Slick To Stick,"Plenty of people have talked about the annoying voice-overs, so I'll pass on that part.This is a good performance, but a tacky editing job. A&E; were stuck in the past when they edited this performance, loading it up with hired models pretending to be girls in the crowd. Find me a woman under 25 who knows 70s Aerosmith lyrics, and I'll buy you this DVD. There are also plenty of ""glory shots"" of band members where it's clear they are not playing the parts you are hearing. I find that unacceptable because it just doesn't add anything - I already know they are cool, I don't have to be convinced.What saves the whole thing in the end is five performances included as extras which must have been edited by someone else. These are clean shots of the songs with no extra frills, and they are simply amazing.Guitar fans: Joe Perry busts out a double neck black Gretch for Living On The Edge that probably resulted in a call from his buddy Jimmy Page looking for a Christmas present. Amazing tone!"
1,Unwatchable. Simply Unwatchable.,"To summarize:(1) Horrible editing. Six cuts per second made me disoriented and angry. Please, Mr. Director and Mr. Film Editor, just point the camera at Steven Tyler and give us the film of him doing his thing.(2) Voices talking over the music. Hey, guess what Mr. Film Editor - I bought this DVD thinking I'd see and hear a concert, not somebody's irrelevant comments over the music.(3) Shots of the audience instead of the band. Obvious plants of paid models in the ""audience"" (although they coulda been filmed separately in a studio, for all I know), acting as if they are jamming to the music. I gagged.I hope someone (Aerosmith, maybe?) will take the raw camera footage from this concert, and re-cut it into something coherent. THAT would be the DVD to buy."
1,"HEY MR. DIRECTOR, GET A GRIP! YOU RUINED THIS DVD!!","This DVD COULD BE GREAT but IT IS BAD, AWFUL. It looks like it was edited/directed by a 14-year old that has just discovered that he can use 100 different cameras. There is so many distractions going around that you just can't enjoy the show! You can not even LISTEN to the show because there are all these stupid interviews going ON THE TOP of the songs! This coulda been a great DVD had it been recorded with 2 or 3 cameras and 10% of the budget if only the editor/director had half a clue of what he/she was doing. Avoid it unless you are 12 years old."
4,Still a Great DVD,"These reviews are pretty funny.You guys are right,too many crowd shots and too much talking.One thing I hate is when they talk over the music.Play the entire song,then talk.I saw Aerosmith in 76'and 93',and they were a hell of a lot better in 93'.The sound on this is very good ,possibly the best I have heard on DVD.The 5 bonus songs save the whole thing and I love Brad Whitford on lead guitar.The whole band is in great form and this is worth the $15.00.It could have been 5 stars except for the above criticisms."
2,Details you have to know before buying.,"Positively. The sound is very good, the band is very good, the choice of songs are good (I would have said great but they played..Elevator..Crying..Don't want to miss a thing - a too commercial period for me).Negatively. This is NOT a non-stop concert. we see footage of the band speaking between songs and even sometimes when the song is already started(easily 30 seconds into the song sometimes). We see an awful lot a silicone babes and stripper looking girls...really I never saw a DVD concert with That much shots of the public. I didn't have the feeling I was there, which is what it takes for me to make a good concert DVD."
3,"Sound was off, not a very good dvd.","Could not wait to watch this DVD. When I got home and watched it with my wife we noticed that the music was much louder then Steven's vocal. You could not hear much of the lyric. This band is great, but who ever made this DVD should edit cartoons for the deff and blind."
3,"Great material, poor format","If you're looking for a live concert, this isn't it. The live cuts are terrific. The dialog leading into each cut is interesting, once or twice. The problem is that you have to listen to the dialog each and every time, which gets tiring in a hurry.Summary. Good material, but the format is very disappointing."
4,Now that I have watched it............,"I rented it first due to some reviews on this site and others being down on the editing. The editing should have been alot better. I will be purchasing this dvd. This will be a very good piece of music history to own. Aerosmith is awesome on stage.The chemistry flows. The bonus footage is the best. If you are a hard core Aerosmith fan, you will enjoy this. It does rock."
5,You owe me...,"I don't have this DVD yet (though I want it), and I just wanted to point out to Christopher Fama that he owes me a copy of it: ""Find me a woman under 25 who knows 70s Aerosmith lyrics, and I'll buy you this DVD."" I'm 17, and I've got all their albums, and of course I know the lyrics!Perhaps you shouldn't be so quick to assume that your generation can keep all this good stuff to itself."
1,bland and disappointing,"this once great rock band's first ever official DVD release is not what it should be. Before you buy, consider this - it's NOT a proper concert. It's a selection of songs chosen from one of their gigs, put together but hidiously edited with pointless interviews and behind-the-scene footage in between the songs that are so annoying they even run over the concert footage. In other words, during the cool intro to ""Sweet Emotion"" you don't actually hear it coz an interview is still going on!! so if you're expecting a full concert start to finish - avoid this DVD now.Aerosmith better bounce back with a major comeback soon before their fans get bored - their ""Honkin' On Bobo"" album was dreadful and this poor excuse for a DVD is not much better."
3,Not worth admission price,"First - I hate it when someone talks over the song intro!!!Really ruined it for me.Steven Tylers interviews are spoken in his own language I guess. I had no idea what he was babbling about. And really didnt care.As a guitar player, I picked up on the overdubbing. I wonder what the editors are looking at?There was a segment involving an ill child, they spent 3 minutes on it tops. If they spent more time on that, and less on Tylers incomprehensible interviews, I may have like this better.Sound is fairly good, though I dont have any HIFI equip."
4,Craig Braden,"Being the behind the scenes camera person for the concert footage, I can honestly say there where no paid models in the crowd. About all the audience shots, what do you think the band wants to see, a documentary of nothing but shots of themselves, they want to see there fans reacting to there music. Its not only a film for their fans, but a film for band to enjoy as well."
2,BIG Let Down!!!!!,"I say BIG with capitol letters, because as in the case with a previous reviewer, I am a life long Aero fan. I can go on, but I won't bore you with the details. The fact that they decided to talk over the top of otherwise perfectly good songs is a complete let down and absolutely horrible decision. Like the other reviewer, I can't put into words how disgusted I was with this disc after waiting for it for so long. Bad move guys. Please try to get it right next time, if there ever is one."
5,Excellent production values!,"This music DVD has the best picture quality I have encountered on a concert DVD. Many of the preceding reviewers are correct that there is too much talk at the beginning of the songs. The interruption of the lead in to to ""Sweet Emotion"" was particularly annoying.The 5.1 mix is very tight, and one of the best 5.1 mixes I have come across. The music is very clear. There is a selection of songs in the bonus material that is pure concert footage without the voice overs and cut scenes of the crowd. It was very enjoyable.If the DVD had an alternate track with the voice overs and snippets on it, and a primary track with just music this disc would be perfect. As it is, I have enjoyed repeated viewing/listening of it and highly recommend it."
3,Could we see the band play?,"Yeah, talking over a song does suck but the thing that really turns a 5 star performance into a 3 star video is that constant cutting from the stage to the fans back and forth. Maybe the band thinks its a tribute to the fans to put some of them on their DVD. More likely is that video directors and editors cut to fans having a good time in order to remind dvd viewers that you too are ""partying with the band."" I believe I can safely say that fans don't buy DVDs to look at fans. We want to see the freaking band!"
3,Don't buy - the Razer HP-1's offer 5.1 surround & sound MUCH better for same price range ...,"I've been using these Creative Fatil1ty Pro series headphones for a few weeks. I eventually bought a set of Razer HP-1 Barracuda 8-Channel Gaming Headphones, and just compared them ... The Razer headphones sound much clearer for both music and games! The creative headphones sound dull and muddy compared to the Razer set. Before hearing the Razer set, I thought the Creative set sounded OK ... now, I really regret spending the ~$80 on them! For around the same price, I could have bought the Razer set to begin with, and they sound much much clearer, and offer 5.1 surround sound which the Creative set doesn't have."
2,Cheap parts,"This headset broke after using it for roughly 2 months. The plastic pieces (that has the signatures on them) connecting the top portion of the headset and the speakers are the problem with this item. They will snap and break eventually.The headset is quite large and will become uncomfortable after hours of wear. Other than those complaints, however, the headset overall is a good product. The mic is very clear (from what others tell me) and the sound quality is decent. The cord is extremely lengthy and has a clip to clip onto shirts/clothing, so that's another plus."
2,Promising... but...,"I've ordered this headset a month or two ago, and within the first day it went from sounding ""alright"" to sounding terrible. Severe distortion plagued every beat of music... so I returned the headset and got it replaced... same exact thing happened... i'm now on the 3rd set... this ones going back to get me a logitech headset... this is the worst $40 i've spent on a computer headset... on the plus side, theyre very comfortable... and look very nice... but thats about it..."
5,Excellent book,Great book to teach children about never giving up on your dreams and family ties. This book is very easy to read to students.
5,Great even for adults!,"I am a substitute teacher in a primary school. I was subbing in the library and this book was part of the lesson for that day on ""perseverance."" I loved it so much I had to buy it for my personal library. I highly recommend this for adults as well as children. If you are trying to reach a goal and have a difficult time attaining it, this book is for you. If you are doing what you set out to do read it anyhow. It will inspire you to keep going forward!!"
4,Wonderbug was super silly!,I remember watching this as a kid in the 70's and for some reason it seemed more serious back then LOL! It was worth seeing again for the memories and I got a kick out of how silly and campy the show was. The actting isn't the greatest either but this was just a kids Saturday morning show. It's a hoot to see it again after all these years!!
1,Confusing/missleading terminology,"Too much tutorial for VS.NET, not enough on C#. If you know something about C++, then steer clear from this book. It uses confusing terminology in wrong context. For instance they inaccurately refer to an ""object of 'type'"" as ""Object derived from class"". Derivation in OOP has a very different meaning. Also they repeatedly call a class as a ""template"" for an object. There are more similar confusing wordings and terminologies. I understand they wanted to be illustrative but IMHO they fell over the fence and rather confuse the reader."
3,Good for Beginners,"This is a very good book if you have no previous C# experience. I decided to read this book after reading Sams Teach Yourself C# in 21 Days and I found that all the programming concepts were review. I did like this book's focus on the Visual Studio .NET IDE and Windows forms, though. It shows you some basics on using list views, tree views, etc. which Teach Yourself C# in 21 Days completely skips. If you're looking for some simple Windows form concepts or if you're looking to learn C# with no programming experience, this is a good book, but people with C# experience and some Windows forms experience can definitely skip it."
4,Good Start to Learning C#,The book was helpful in starting me on the path to writing in C#. It was easy to understand unlike other books on programming I have read and had examples and projects that were doable by me not just those who wrote it. It did take me longer than 24 hours to finish but was worth it.
4,Recommend!,"Great book. I have been working with VB for a couple of years and wanted to get a quick insight into C#. This book was great, it not only gave me the insight and knowledge I was looking for with C#, but gave me a tutorial on the VS IDE with quick tricks I can start using in C# or VB. The only reason that I didn't give this book 5 starts is because it uses the old naming conventions. Other than that the code samples and examples used through the book was real life. Recommend for newbies and current programmers that want a quick read on C#."
4,clean product with professional results,"I am pleased with these brackets, they were perfect for my installation. This would have been 5 stars if a template had been included to make for easier installation. The directions say to trace the inside of the mount and cut it out, but logic dictates the mount would not fit in the hole you just cut. I created my own template before trying to install these and had no issues."
4,Excellent Bracket,The bracket is great for cables. I used it for behind wall cables when mounting a flat panel TV. The only thing that made it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it would have been helpful to have a paper template for cutting out the drywall.
5,Worked as described. Great for variety of uses,Worked with many different plates / uses. Would recommend highly. Made installation of home theater very easy. Good quality. Perfect
5,Easy installation,I used two of these mounting brackets to hide the cords going to my wall mounted tv. The datacomm plates fit perfectly and installation was a breeze. If you have a good jab knife you can cut the holes for these in a few minutes following the simple directions.
4,Works as advertised,"I used this to attach a low-voltage media plate. It was easy to install, and the plate looks great. I wish it had come with a template to mark the opening, but measuring worked just fine."
4,L/V Bracket,Worked great and holds flush to the wall. I would buy again if they didn't force these reviews on me repeatedly
