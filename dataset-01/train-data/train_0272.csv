2,Tao Lin is right,"Tao Lin's review is on the money. Heller repeats himself over and over - sometimes entire paragraphs - and not as a stylistic choice but because he probably didn't know where the story was going. No beginning, no middle, and no ending, just a long slog through pages of exposition with no real purpose. The concept and title are catchy, but its all sizzle and no steak. Not recommended, despite its ""classic"" description in most circles."
1,Terrible,"It was the slowest book I have ever read. Joseph Heller over describes the characters and tries to use a 1960's euphoric childish humor that more irony than anything. 3 key words, Do Not Read"
3,"""Best book I have ever read!"" Anyone who says this.....","here are a few recommendations.If you want to laugh out loud and tell your friends about the funniest book you've ever read, pick up something by Bill Bryson or Tony Horowitz. If you want to read ""the best book you've ever read"" pick up a Dickens, Stienbeck, Orwell, Twain, or Harper Lee and surely you won't be disappointed.This book is definitely different and I will not go so far as to say avoid it, or even that I didn't enjoy it simply because Heller tells his story in such a unique way, but to put such a book on a pedestal above works by the authors I have mentioned, which is by no means a complete list, is ridiculous."
1,a confusing mess,"Wow. I just made it through the first three chapters withouttossing it out the window, which I really wanted to do.I kept reading, hoping I would eventually ""get it"".All I got was Highly disappointed.The writing is repetitive, confusing, and has no substantial point.What is all the hype about? I feel like the little kid in theEmperor's New Clothes story..."
5,There is no adjective I could use to describe this book...,"Hilarious, despondent, satirical, sardonic, mordant, cynical and simply brilliant. Catch 22 is all these and more. Quite possibly the best book I have ever read. An absolute must-read."
2,Not for me,"Don't know if this is meant to be funny, at least I am not laughing. All the characters are indifferent to me, still haven't figured out what is the plot after 80 pages, so I'm really struggling to finish this one."
3,a bit slow,This book took me much longer than I would have liked to read. It can be very slow and overly vulgar at times but it is funny and intelligent
5,BEST BOOK I VE READ RECENTLY,I STARTED RECENTLY READING CLASSIC NOVELS. EVERY THING FROM THE BIBLE TO ULYSSES. THIS BY FAR WAS THE BEST AND FUNNIEST BOOK I'VE READ. I ALSO BELIEVE CATCH-22 MUST HAVE BEEN THE INFLUENCE FOR THE MOVIE AND TV SERIES OF M*A*S*H. EXCELLENT AND VERY EASY TO READ
3,Lost in time,"Full of sarcasm, ridiculously funny, with wonderful prose interspersed. I am sure it was unique and shocking for its day but I believe it to be overrated and does not stand the test of time. He makes use of the dictionary, so keep one handy, and the ranting dialog gets to be too much. What Heller did was to spawn others to do the same, such as the novel ""Castle Keep"", which was better, and the movies Mash and Kelly's Heroes.The protagonist, and antagonist is a W.W.II bombardier who finds himself at the breaking point. Along with bombing missions his other mission is to find a way out of the war. It doesn't help that the Generals keep adding more missions onto the squadron's quota. We find our way into the hospital quite often through this read. The characters are unordinary, finding any way they can to divert and diverge themselves from the war; we discover entrepreneurs, maniacs, ridicule, capitalists, ineptness........ but rarely normalcy.Wish you wellScott"
2,not my cup of tea,"I have to be completely honest that Im half way through this book and I'm looking for an escape hatch as I'm really not enjoying this masterpiece. Reading much of the one/two star comments I agree with the average interpretation but I don't agree with childish sledginging, naming those who enjoyed the book as fakers. I,m going to give the book back to the friend with crab apple cheeks and rubber under wear who gave it to me. Sorry mate but it just wasn't my cup of tea, this goes down with the one percent of books I couldn't find the will power to complete."
2,Confused,"I bought this book because it was known as a classic. I don't know if you have to read it 20 times, but I was confused through the whole book. I couldn't tell the timeframe of each chapter. Maybe I just don't appreciate that each chapter was a catch 22. Oh well, I don't suggest to buy this book, though."
5,The greatest book ever written,"My one-line summary says it all. This is the best-written book ever. The characters are unforgettable, the setting is amazingly real, and the plot twists and turns, skipping around until it is on complete picture. Yossarian proves that often the people called crazy are the sanest ones."
5,Did Mark Twain Die and Come Back As Joseph Heller?,"This book is so sad, its not funny. And there are other things in it that aren't even funnier. Like re-reading this damn book every two years or so and crying hard not to laugh at the same passages."
5,Very subversive,"This book has helped keep me sane while living through some insane times. Once you read it, you will never look at the world the same way again. ""The best there is"" certainly describes Catch-22."
5,Was Yossarian related to Holden Caulfield????,"Catch-22 was easily one of the greatest masterpieces I've had the enjoyment of reading. The book will make you laugh, cry, and make you eager to read on. Of course though this book along with every other book imaginable isn't for every audience out there. For one thing veterans are sure as hell to hate it since the whole book makes a mockery of the military, and I also feel that people who are acute to profanity and sexual situations [are there such people?] wouldn't like to read this book. Young people such as myself are sure to love the book though; if they like to read to begin with. On a final note, I'd also like to say that Yossarian's cynicism reminds me very much of the character Holden Caulfield, the boy from the story The Catcher in the Rye (which is another one of my personal favorites). To those people who've read CITR then Catch-22 is for you."
5,CATCH-22 a masterpiece.,When this book came out in the 1960's the world was obviously a different place to todays world.WWII was recent history and the old guard establishment in the UK and US were in control of the media .The reviews were mixed because the reviewers did not understand or comprehend the subtleties and genius of this book. They missed the point.I remember reading it at the age of 13. We were brought up to be voracious readers in our house and this in truth got under the wire as my parents did not really understand what it was. They were about as pro-establishment as you could get. They blamed the downfall of the British Empire on The Beatles.Suffice to say I have probably read this a dozen times in my life at the age of 50.I used to stay up late in bed laughing till I cried re-reading individual chapters. I still do .I read it again last year.A remarkable insight into human nature. No need to describe the events.
2,Could not finish,"I tried to get into this book, but could not. I read about 30% and stopped. I may try to finish later."
2,"Don't be fooled - this ""classic"" is a stinker","Sorry, people. For some reason this book has been branded a classic simply because...well, I'm not sure why frankly. The satire hits you over the head until you are dizzy (unfortunately not with laughter), the plot is cellophane thin, the message completely muddled. The book flows as smoothly as a trainwreck. There are some witty commentaries but overall don't believe the hype. This book is an outdated bore."
1,60's trash,"Anybody mind if I break up the love-fest for this piece of anti-establishment drivel? Get serious folks. The premise of this book is based on three assumptions, all incorrect, which are as follows: (1) the military is evil, (2) any person in the military is an idiot, and (3) any person who mocks the military is heroic.Please. This type of thinking went out with flower power and tie-dyed t-shirts. Get with the times, people. Vietnam is over."
1,"Heller, I heard you the first time...","Take war, mix in the Marx Brothers, and place them in Alice's Wonderland, and you have Catch-22...only the book isn't nearly as interesting as I just made it sound. It is simply one of the most tedious, poorly-written books I've ever read. It makes its point well within the first 100 pages, then spends the next 300 plus pages beating you over the head making the same point. War is hell, the military bureaucracy is tedious and illogical, war profiteering (capitalism?)is evil, there is no God, there are bigots in the world (and half of them are in Yossarian's chain of command), blah blah blah. The characters are shallow, cold, and completely unlikeable - perhaps none more so than our poor, put-upon Capt. Yossarian, although I don't think that was the author's intent. I appreciate the literary device of absurdity as much as anyone, but its overuse in this novel struck me as...well, absurd."
2,"Well, it was okay.","This book is interesting but it is not one of the best books I have read. I found that Catch-22 was a slow moving book that often wanders aimlessly in many directions. However, this is a good bed time book for someone who has trouble falling asleep"
4,Catch-22,"My only complaint was that there was writing in the book and that wasn't mentioned in the product description like it was for others. Other than that, my book came in on time and I am happy with it."
5,Very Enjoyable,"This book is total satire and irony concerning WWII, combined with a dose of sobering morality along the way. This book will make you will laugh, and just maybe, cry. Perhaps old WWII vets may not enjoy reading this book, but I certainly did. Only down side was the open-ended ending, leaving the reader with no clue what happens to Yossarian. However, it showed what a strong, unyielding character Yossarian was. I would rate this book as one of the top 10 I've read. Lots of rare vocabulary words--have a dictionary at hand."
4,Joseph Heller's Catch-22,"I, like many others, have used the term ""catch-22"" knowing it's core meaning but never knowing it's origin. The book was nothing like I had expected and the wacky way the author's characters were drawn was a little hard for me to accept. However, the more I read the more I understood that these players were caricatures of the real-life insanities that many of us have experienced.By the time I finished the book I felt a sense of loss that it had ended!Wes Hill"
5,one word... crazy,"If you are going to read this book in a subconscious state of mind, don't even bother. The book is well written and extremely humorous, but the reader has to think while reading it. The plot is not obvious; the characters are not fully described. This book was written for a thinking man (or woman) with a good sense of humor. I would say that it is one of the best books that I have ever read."
4,Why are you bothering to read the reviews?,This book is a classic. Catch-22 is on all of those Top 100 books of the century lists. Just start reading the damn thing already! Jesus!
4,The insanity of war,"Captain Yossarian has a problem. He wants to live, but thousands of people he has never met are trying to kill him! Every mission he flies as bombadier for the Army Air Forces could get him killed, and he wants to get out of the war. Unfortunately, the only way he can get out is if he's crazy, and wanting to get out is proof that he's sane.This is a biting, cynical indictment of beauracracy and the narrow-minded paper-pushers who make it so disfunctional. From the squadron commander, Major Major, who was promoted based solely on his name, to Colonel Cathcart, who keeps raising the number of missions needed before the crews can go home and volunteering his crews for the most dangerous missions, to General Peckem, who wants to add the bomb groups to his special services command, this book is full of over-the-top characters that are just barely within the realm of believability. This book is funny and infuriating, at the same time, and reflects the worst traits of any beauracracy."
3,Great re-write of Voyage Au Bout De La Nuit,"That's about it. Louis-Ferdinand Celine wrote Voyage Au Bout De La Nuit in 1952. Mr Heller Americanised the setting and the dialogue but the entire book, the ideas, the storyline is virtually identical to V.A.B.D.L.N."
1,What did I miss?,"I forced myself through one hundred pages of this book and then I stopped. Nothing much was happening & I just had no interest in the characters or slow moving story line. Maybe the book picks up further a long, but I wasn't interested enough to read on. Maybe I missed something as the reviews for this book are most high."
1,Awful,"How anyone could call this book a classic, or well written, or even funny is beyond me. Obviously, a lot people were smoking a lot of weed in the sixties to think this thing is worth reading. I am being generous giving the book one star."
1,Overrated,"The most overrated book I've ever read. Catch 22 is filled with unfunny, Abbott and Costello-like ""Who's on First?"" dialogue that goes nowhere. Remember those old war movies wherein the acting was overly sappy and sub par? Well that's Catch 22. You'll find yourself getting the point, and tortuously trudging through several pages for the point to be complete.A must read for insomniacs."
3,Dissenting Opinion,"Although I found the book to be wildly funny and brilliantly clever I feel that the world view forwarded is dated and dangerous. This book is a perfect example of the counter culture's henious self indulgence. The book brings up the issue of responsibility and Yossarian retorts with ""I don't care."" Worth reading but deserves analysis and thought. I'm glad I read it as an adult and not a teenager."
4,Catch 22,"Entertaining, funny and extremely well written, Catch 22 lives up to its iconic title. Why did I wait so long to read it?"
5,title,"funniest book and movie ever made. I'vc never read a book more incredibly ironic, more incredibly true to form, more realistically typical of miltary life than this book. I've never seen a movie that ever complimented a book more than this one."
5,Perhaps the Great American Novel of the 20th Century,"I first read this book in 1962 as a 20 year old. I loved it, was transformed by it. Years later I would periodically re-read it and fall in love all over again with Heller's prose, his unmistakable characters,and his profound truths about war and human nature. All this served up with a rich language and zany characters. I just re-read it yet again now, 50 years later, and found more to discuss and ponder evan all these readings later. The rich and rewarding experience of reading ""Catch-22"" is a gift to all who experience it."
5,"No Catch, Just A Great Book","The story focuses around Yossarian, a WWII officer stationed in the Meditaranian Sea. Everyone thinks that Yossarian is insane because he is paranoid about dying. As Heller shows though, this is the very thing that makes him sane.Quite simply, one of the best books ever written."
4,"""Confusion....Only Problem""","Catch-22 is a great book to demonstrate certain literary devices. This book is a great book to understand foreshadowing and symbolism. Heller uses great symbolism to present the idea or purpose he's trying to get across. The one main problem I had with this novel was the confusion that Heller puts the reader through. I like books that have mystery but are straight forward with explaining the ideas, exceppt for Heller who makes you think you know the idea but there's actually a twist to it."
4,How long will it take you to really figure it out,"The spotlight in which Catch-22 has remained since it became so very popular during the 1960's, is one of great significance to literature. Heller was ingenues in the way he compiled the stories of these seemingly simple characters. The further along in the story the more attached you become the each character. You fall in love when they do, feel loss when they are morning and find humor when you realize the foolishness of their situations.This book was the first of its kind in the way it was organized. It's plot is not in chronological order and you find things out long before you truly understand what they mean. This book is a wonderful piece of literature and recommend not only reading it, but possibly reading it again to fully understand it."
5,Catch-22 is a masterpiece of social satire,"Heller's timeless classic, Catch-22, is amazing. Hellercrafts an upside-down, senselessly sensible world whereeveryone but the main character, Yossarian, is sane. Or isYossarian the only sane one? Decide for yourself when youread the book. The novel is endlessly funny, pointedlyrevealing and gleefully rambunctious, filled with inherentcontradiction that somehow makes perfect sense. It's beenone of my personal favorites for years and will remain sofor many to come. Highly recommended."
5,A Timeless Classic and the Best Anti-War Novel Ever Written,"A brief exploration of plot and character serves as an important and integral segment of most book reviews. None of that is necessary when speaking about Joseph Heller's masterpiece, Catch-22. Every year, in high schools throughout America, a rather large percentage of english teachers introduce this novel to yet another class of high school english students. What a good thing it is that these teachers do.Catch-22, from the moment of its publication, redefined the anti-war novel. Witty, ironic, savagely sarcastic, yet all the time retaining the poignancy of truth, this book has played a substantial role in teaching people to question authority.If you've read Catch-22 before, grab it off the bookshelf and read it again. If you've been given this book as a class assignment, thank your teacher and relish your good fortune."
4,Great book...but the movie? Hrm...no,"Really good book, it was a great change for me from my usual boring technical books. Really worth the time."
4,messy masterpiece,"So yes, the book can read a bit messy. It does take some acclimation, but it is more than worth the work (for some people, such a style makes perfect sense and would give such a book 10 stars if possible). However, if you are not one of thee latter folks, hang with it, and you will be stuck with a brilliant piece of writing that will haunt you for a very long time. This book has staying power, and that's what may make it something of a masterpiece (albeit a messy one)."
4,Not Funny,"I still can't decide if this difficult and cumbersome read was worth it. It was like watching Dilbert devolve into a horror movie... I kept reading with a mounting sense of terror, I was actually biting my nails by the last few chapters.This novel *is* a work of genius - the repetitions that so many readers find unbearable demonstrate the way Yossarian's mind travels in circles around the traumatic events he cannot face without going completely crazy (they remind me of the writing of Connie Willis - a favorite of mine). I don't think anything else I have read has brought home the horror and senselessness of war quite like this book, and I can see why it is taught in so many literature classes, you could discuss it for hours.....however, that being said... I have no desire whatsoever to open this book again."
4,clever and funny -- but sometimes it tries too hard,"A clever mix of ""alice in wonderland"" kind of dialogues in a ""apocalypse now"" scenery. A rich cast of unlikely characters, full of bizarre idiosyncrasies, blurs the border between reality and fantasy, and makes you ponder about the absurd double-binds of our ""normal"" lives. The very non-linear narrative ties together a long list of episodes, loosely revolving are the main character, Yossarian.Some parts were truly great (I loved Milo's character and syndicate), but at times the it seemed to try too hard to be clever and witty."
5,Five Stars of course,This book is a must read. I read this book more than twenty years ago and I can still tell you the story verbatim.No library is complete without this book.
4,the goods and bads,"Catch 22 is satirical novel which pokes fun at many different parts of our society. It manly criticizes capitalism, the army, and the chain of commands that it consists of. Some readers may dislike this anti-military tone. I liked this novel because Heller's original and repetitive style of writing was funny as well as influential, but by no means is it easy to read. A less competent reader may not enjoy the book as much because the underlining humor may not be understood. The plot and character development is choppy making it difficult to understand the story line. In order to enjoy the novel you must enjoy the humor because the plot itself is not interesting enough to cary you through the book."
3,"Catch 22...not horrible, but not fantastic!","This book was quite interesting. Some of the dialogue was funny...still, it felt like I was wading through all the dull chapters, military names and titles, to get to the good stuff. Still, some of the content was funny, especially the part about Doc Daneeka ""dying"", Washington Irving, and stealing the plum tomato. And of course, the concept of Catch-22. It all makes you think a little bit more than you did."
5,Great book!,"This book is great! All the characters are insane! I'm almost halfway through and I still haven't found a plot! This book is hilarious, but it is sad and shows how crazy war really is."
5,It's a paradox that you can't help but connect with.,"Being a sophomore in high school, I didn't know what kind of treat I was in for when I picked up Catch-22. I was hooked after the first page. The witty paradox of Yossarian's situation and the realization that he represents all of us, really influenced me. John Yossarian's character really pulls the reader into the plot. I couldn't help but sympathize with him, yet there is something in his personality that offends the reader as well. He is crude at times, but it is so close to the way things were during that time, that you forgive him, and learn to love this character. I thouroughly enjoyed this book, and will read it again and again... I highly recomend it to anyone who likes a challenge... you will be pleasantly rewarded."
4,I could not stop laughing.,"This is one of the funnest books to read. It starts out a little hazy, but after you catch on to heller's style, the book becomes better than anything out there. This is a book where you can laugh and will not have to think too much."
3,Thought it would be funnier,"I read this book based on a friend's recommendation that it was ""the funniest book ever"". Sorry to say that I can't agree with her. This is one of those books that does have some funny parts but that's it... these funny parts simply aren't delivered on a consistent basis. Despite this, I did think that Heller did deliver a powerful message about the sheer absurdity of war. Other than Yossarian (the main character), character development wasn't that strong but that's just my opinion. Overall, I thought it was an average book and a bit of a letdown."
3,ok but...,"this is an ok book, but the movie was much better, the book drags a little too much, you would also need to read it a few times to really understand what the author is trying to say."
5,I love this book,"I read this book this spring, and it is now one of my favorite novels. The language is challenging, but not flashy. The story is rich, full of wit, humor, loss, friendship, hope, and triumph. I recommend this book to everyone."
1,Don't look for justice in this life......,"It's almost as if the band could'nt hear themselves as the were making this sorry excuse for what they called a record. I've heard better cover bands play for drinks at The Thirsty Whale on weekends. If this is what you call rock-n-roll these days, then I hope Elvis is really dead so he doesnt have to witness the horror. These guys are on Subpop? No justice, I tell you....no justice at all."

1,Up the Academy.,"I grew up more with Porky's,Revenge of the Nerds among others,So When I decided to watch this on Netflix cause it was from the 80's,I made a bad decision,It has it's funny moments but the Audio/editing is off,the plot is there but the final product just can't hack it to me. I really like though The Kid getting the Corvette,Although if you pay attention he's looking at a 1980 Corvette brochure and the car itself when he is in it later on is a 1978/1979.The Caddy is cool,the gun Instructor Lady Is beautiful with a nice rack,And Antonio Vargas makes brief funny appearance with hardly any dialogue."
3,I love the 80s,"If you grew up with cable TV in the eighties you'll remember this one. It is still funny when the kids get their revenge.. has some quotable lines.. ""Say it againnn!"" Not very ""P.C."" with the stereo type characters, butr it was the 80s."
5,up the academy,"blast from the past, great movie and it got here quickly. movie was perfect, thank you"
4,Good. No... Great,"This film could have been 5 stars and a true classic if it was edited better. Watching it, you feel that some important footage was left out. There's some set-ups that don't get punchlines. But anyway, everything else works. Great cast, surprisingly entertaining plot and enough good jokes to make this an essential 80s comedy."
4,SAY IT AGAIN!!!! SAY IT AGAIN!!!!,"Okay. This movie is amazingly stupid. I will readily admit that but damn, sometimes stupid is so enjoyable. I can't believe it's FINALLY available on DVD. I never thought I'd see the day. Ron Leibman's performance is one of the best comedic villians of all time. Funny thing is, he saw the role as a pox on his career. Think again, Ron. His performance makes the whole film and God bless him for it. And the soundtrack...so damn good. Do yourself a favor and pick this up if you'd like a good bite of late seventies-early eighties teen exploitation frivolity. And Stacey Nelkin is none too shabby either as the inevitable teen ""love interest"". Her ""babeosity"" is drool inducing. Just a lot of un-PC fun for all! Buy and enjoy!"
4,GREAT!,"This was a great peice of work that kept me laughing and quoteing lines for days. I also have to say that it was filmed in and around my home town. The gas station attendent, Chester, is the sheriff in my home town. Great work Ken!"
3,a fun movie!,"yeah, well it's stupid and immature... but it's a fun movie. I'll watch it over and over just to catch 3 or 4 of my favorite scenes. the best gimmick is the wind blowing every time Leibman's character is approaching. the person who produced this movie must have been high at the time, but i thank him for the times my friends and i could gather around the television at 3am and enjoy a good laugh. it also has a pretty rockin late 70's soundtrack."
1,Poor size chart,"The item came on time, but the ""size small"" was way too big for anyone, it would be a Large at many other stores. I dont even wear them because they are way too big for me."
1,My copy from Amazon only came in Korean subtitles!,"I've seen part of this great movie on TV, but wanted to watch the entire thing. I purchased a DVD copy here on Amazon and took delivery. I kept the copy for several months without viewing it. Well, tonight I tried to view it for the first time and guess what? The ONLY subtitle it will display is Korean! There was no mention from the seller that this was the case. Since I don't speak Italian nor Korean, I just wasted my money on this dog.I wonder if there are others who are getting the wool pulled over their eyes also?"
4,KX-TG543M 5.8 GHz,Great set of phones. Easy to set up and use. The only reason that I give it a 4 is that the wall hanger looks awful. This contraption was a complete after thought. If you plan on using it find a place where you can't see the side.
4,My review,I would recommend this product. If somebody is planning to use voip these phones are perfect
5,Very nice phones,"These are the best phones I've had--* Are not interfered with by microwaves or other 2.4GHz appliances (duh they are 5.4Ghz phones)* Can move phone books between handsets, not having the same phone book in each handset is nice if you have kids or two people (roommates) who do not want to share/see each others numbers all the time* Batteries last a long time* Range is superb... I could walk across the street to the donut shot and still have signal (base station in the center of a 3rd floor apartment)* Sound is good from the handset, could be a bit louder and maybe not as tinny* As usual, the headset jacks result in complaints of ""you sound distant"", etc... this has been true for the last 3 models of cordless phones I've had with headset jacks--an AT&T;, a no-name brand, and now Panasonic. The headsets work fine w/ cellphones, but for some reason they just don't work well with cordless phones"
5,"Very nice, good features, very clear","I upgraded from my 2.4 G phone to this one. Very nice improvement with sound quality and some additional features. The only disappointing item is that the distance range isn't more than the 2.4G phone. I tried placing the base unit on the second level of my house to improve range but to no help.Also, I have tried various headsets with my 2.4 G phone and all of them produced results that had the party on the other end complaining that they couldn't hear me. I used a Panasonic brand headset with this phone and it gets rave reviews. Everyone says the sound quality is excellent."
1,"Terrible, awful phone system","I just returned it after 5 days of trying to use it. I did everything correctly (am an experienced, expandable-phone user) in setting it up. All of my callers sounded as though they were talking through a barrel, even with ""voice-enhancement"" enabled. (Voice enhancement? How about ""voice impairment?"") I was constantly asking them to repeat what they'd just said. Horrible static, too: I bought a noise filter from Radio Shack & that did no good. I replaced it with a GE, similarly priced, ""interference-free"" expandable system. It's charging now; we'll see. No more Panasonics for me."
4,Good intro to new puppy owners,"This is a nice little book for new puppy owners. Having owned dogs most of my life, I knew a lot of the information, but since I haven't owned a puppy in many years, I thought this would be a nice refresher course. It was. I had forgotten some of the things this book covers, but some of it seemed obvious."
2,hover disc,"Product wasn't what I expected. Material was flimsy, difficult to blow up. Would not buy another one. Wasn't happy with product."
3,Something Missing,"I have enjoyed the new Kimba series, and was looking forward to seeing the final story in this tape. Sadly to say, the two episodes on this tape work up to the climax of the plot, then drop off. Fans will be disapointed at this sudden drop off in mid plot."
1,Bad description. parts don't fit,"Bought this for a family member because of the product description -- which is wrong when it says ""Ships complete, with easy to assemble snap on seat with lid and large 12 qt. capacity pail with lid"". It ships completely broken down and must be fully assembled. The snap on seat is easy to assemble but it does not otherwise come complete. Also, the cross bars that hold in the bucket are too short and don't fit. I am going to bend them out to make them longer and then I think they will fit. Very disappointed. Otherwise, the product appears durable and good for the cost. I would probably give it 4 or 5 stars but for the bad description and the too short bars."
5,Fantastic Receiver,"I love this receiver, great sound quality and extremely solid construction so it doen't look and feel cheap like a lot of newer receivers. Should last many many years and provide great sound output!"
3,Incredibly Hard to assemble,Nice bookshelf once it's all put together but you need to be a contortionist with a headlamp to be able to assemble it anywhere near correctly. The holes for the screws don't always align properly (some in the row are perfectly aligned with others completely out) and the angle in which they need to be screwed in gives you no sight line or range to turn a screwdriver.
3,Too small,This mp3 player case was too small for me. Make sure you know the dimensions of your player before getting this. It seems to only fit squareish mp3 player shapes. Otherwise it seems durable enough for a workout.
4,Good continuation of Web Page development,"As part of my training on basic Web page development, I started with Ruth Maran's HTML book and then followed it up with this book. This gave me a 1-2 punch at mastering web development. I needed Web development skills to augment my Visual Basic and SQL Server skills and both of these books provided the foundation for more advanced training. This is a good continuation of the HTML. Indeed you will use HTML in your Active Server Pages development. Both authors did a great job with this book. I could not find any major errors but did find some minor errors. The examples at the bottom of each page can be hard to read especially for people with sight problems. I highly recommend both books."
1,waist of time and money,"Half of each page is devoted to a picture of an almost empty screen with comments like ""Position the insertion point between the quotation marks and type the name of the file you want to include"".This book is shallow."
3,"A good book, but too elementary","I bought this book hoping to learn the basics of ASP. Well, I sure did learn the basics! I already have experince with HTML, java, cgi, perl, and visual basic. So I already know the basics of programing. The way this book is divided up, is by ASP subjects, and really did not show how to integrate them into a finished web project that really had a use. Unfortently, I may still have to buy another ASP book to fully understand ASP. I would recomend this book to anyone who does not have ANY programing experience at all. But too elementary for myself."
3,Very weird and strange and in a way..... SCARY!,"On a trip to England, I bought this book. I thought it would be really good casue I am a big Lennon fan. I thought. I thought this book had some humor in it and had a few good pictures. And Amazon, I have a copy if anyone orders it."
3,Disappointing,"I love screwball comedies and had heard that Carol Lombard was not only beautiful but a brilliant comedienne, so I expected a lot from this film. The first half was funny, due mostly to Barrymore, who was at times truly hilarious. By the time they got on the Twentieth Century, though, the plot was forced, and it wasn't much fun anymore. I did enjoy the character of the little man who stuck stickers all over the train.Lombard was the biggest disappointment. She is very beautiful and wears some nice costumes, but she delivers all her lines at the same volume level: screaming. This gets really annoying. By the end of the film I was beyond caring what happened to any of them.I give it three stars just for Barrymore's performance."
2,Overrated Mess,"I can think of so so many screwball comedies better than this..................Barrymore, great actor that he is, really emotes way too much..................Hawks obviously could not control him..................the only reason to watch this is for Lombard..................wow, what a great looking woman she was! Watch My Man Godfrey, Libeled Lady, or Theodora Goes Wild if you want to see GREAT screwball comedy."
2,Too much ham provided by John Barrymore (Jaffe) & Carole,"Lombard(Lily). They outrageosly overact their way thru this disappointing 1934 comedy. It's a battle of wits as Lily tries to escape the clutches of her director the great Jaffe. He has made her a big success on Broadway. But he is sufficating her with his controlling of her every waking moment. She rebels & flees to Hollywood & becomes a star. Jaffe is a flop after her. Several years pass & they happen to both be traveling on the 20th Century. It is the train traveling between Chicago & New York City in the 30's. The hysteronics commence. I know Lombard is the queen of the screwball comedy genre but the dialogue becomes rather tedious. He plots & schemes to do everything he can to get her to sign a contract. She does everything to evade him. But they are on fast moving train that rarely stops. They are, of course, in love. Neither is a likeable character & they deserve each other."
3,Way over the top!,"For film historians or those curious about how women were used in 30s films, this certainly is typical. The raves about its insights and comic moments are hard to support as it is so exaggerated. Harlow is smart and quick and Barrymore, at a low point in his career,takes his egotistical character up into the thin air. A lot of patience is needed to enjoy it."
2,beg to differ--disappointing,"I had high hopes for this film. I love Carole Lombard--Barrymore, Connolly and Hawkes too. But for me, this screwball comedy/farce seems dull and dated.Lombard is well below par, certainly nothing compared to her work in My Man Godfrey. And unlike Lombard's chemistry with William Powell (her ex-husband in real life)in that film, here she seems to have none with Barrymore.Barrymore has some good ham moments, as do Connolly and the other sidekick. As a whole, a long 90 minutes, with lots of painfully obvious ""humor"".For all the positive reviews here, I think smarter comedies of the period--like My Man Godfrey, The Lady Eve and Philadelphia Story--hold up better today than this one."
5,One of the first screwball comedies,"A fast-paced and hilarious screwball comedy. Howard Hawks directing Barrymore, Lombard and some great character actors ( with great dialogue by Ben Hecht) -- all this on a speeding train -- what more could you ask for?"
4,worth having for the Young Reader's Companion,The Young Reader's Companion provides a plot and reading level for important children's literature. This is about half of the book.
2,Not recommended,"Problem 1. This case is ill fitting for a newer ipod with the earphones socket to the left. The case is designed to fit the earphones through the center, you have to contort your headphone jack to get the case to close, which worries me since it may well damage the earphones.Problem 2. The armband is ineffective. It is narrow and flimsy and the ipod flops around when you walk or move your arm. It is a bad design because the Velcro doesn't hold the case firmly, so it hangs from your arm and makes it useless for a work-out situation.I had actually expected to get a different armband with this, since some retailers advertise it with a thicker, more secure looking armband. The packaging for the product actually pictures this thicker, sleeker design. But it doesn't come with this, it comes with a narrow piece of neoprene that is poorly designed.Get something else."
3,Just ok,"You don't realize the importance of a view window until your MP3 player has a few slow songs on it and you're at the gym trying to get into a workout. Easy solution, of course, is to restrict your playlist. The product is constructed nice, but it does keep sliding down my arm when I position in the bicep area. Again, it does what it needs to do, and a good value, but has a few quirks"
3,very cool but not practical,"I bought this bank for all the kids in my family. It is very interesting and they got a kick out of trying to figure out how it works. However, it doesn't hold a lot of change and doesn't 'secure' to promote saving. I want to teach my 2 children and inspire the other children within my family structure to save. This is not the resource to do it with. Hence, looking for other banks....I'll let you know when I find one."
3,Rather cheap,"Rather cheaply made, this is not a toy to hand down, but it does provide stacking and packing play."
3,Meh,"I love the boxes of dried cranberries and cherries, but the blueberries are not so tasty. The texture is more chewy and the taste is more tart. I like having the dried cranberries handy to add to cereal, mix with some peanuts, or add to other dishes, and I will order them again. I will not order these blueberries again."
5,Great with everything- can't beat the price!,"I've been buying dried blueberries from the grocery store for ages, and struggled everytime I had to buy a tiny bag that only lasted 2 days. I went online to see if I could find them in bulk, and low and behold...! I use these on everything: Spinach salads, cereal, yogurt, trail mix, even just to snack on plain. These blueberries are acutally better than the ones I was buying before, because they don't have High Fructose Corn Syrup. Sugar is actually healthier and tastes better. I will buy these again and again."
2,Too much sugar!,Too bad they don't have a sugar-free option. They taste like raisins with all the sugar. Good perhaps with breakfast food but not so much for a snack.
5,These blueberries are FULL of flavor!,We are licensed Home Bakers in Vermont and people think we bake with FRESH blueberries...that is how good these blueberries are! When we explain that we bake with dried blueberries they are astounded. Traverse Bay blueberries have minimal processing and since we do not use any preservatives or anything artificial in our baking we appreciate that ! Just note these blueberries are NOT small as some blueberries are that are grown in other parts of the country.
3,Okay,Most of the blueberries are juicy but some where dry and hard to chew. This was my 1st order w/Traverse Bay and I don't think I'd reorder. I've bought better dries blueberries else where.
5,Delicious,"These are my go to snack! I really like the convenience of dried fruit. I also like the pricing for bulk orders like this. I was so satisfied, I've reordered the item for myself and friends."
5,Awesome! Simply the berry best,"I have ordered these twice and my kids love these. Definitely more cost effective than purchasing them at the store. Great quality, love that they are on subscribe and save. We use them in granola, yogurt, oatmeal, trail mix and even eat a handful of them plain. We have yet to use them in pancakes and muffins, but they really are good!"
4,New improved version?,We needed this tool for work while in another state. It was impractical to get the one from home. We prefer the old style with the handle made of wood. We couldn't find one of those so chose this as next best. The cutting part still works as expected.
2,"Vender honest, but product so-so","The blade is made of thin tin that bends and breaks easily. If you have recently painted or mildly painted shut windows, this tool will work great. If your windows are really painted shut, the tin blade will bend and break. Basically, the price is a good indication of the quality."
4,good for the money,Violin is a good one for a first electric. Did not come with any instructions on how to put the bridge on. We had our violin teacher put it on and tune for the first time. We did have a string break right away because we tried to keep it in tune. The pegs slipped quite a bit. Bought all 4 new strings and had those put on along with fine tuners on all four strings. Has worked much better for our daughter. I would plan on investing a little more in better strings and the tuners. We paid about 40.00 for strings and tuners We have not had a problem since.
2,Not so good!,This electric Violin was awful! It didnt come with the tuner and only 1 of the fine tuners were there. And only one of the things that hooks the string to the chin rest thing was there! and the rosin is awful! The bow was wierd and when I tried to play a string it didnt play! And the bridge is cheap!
1,low budget cliche,"Groan. This low budget oater is full of every ""noble savage"" cliche in the book (who can forget Scar offering 3 horses for Beth and then fighting Grayeagle for her). The best that can be said for this movie is that their hearts were in the right place, and the scenery is gorgeous. Plus they did cast Iron Eyes Cody as one of the leads. The lead actress, however, can't really act, and whoever cast Alex Cord as Grayeagle should have their head examined. He is an adequate actor in Western roles but at the time this movie was made there were some American Indian actors perfectly capable of playing this role. Vies with Winterhawk for worst '70's picture in this vein."
1,Do not give this to your baby!!,"With all the recent news regarding harmful chemicals leaching from plastic containers into food, I was shocked to see the recycle number 7 on the bottom of these plastic containers. Number 7 labeled plastic is the worst plastic you can possibly use. It is being recommended by health officials to avoid products packaged with these containers. This story was aired on Good Morning America. I had just purchased about 20 packages of this baby food for my daughter and immediately threw every one away. This makes me very concerned that Gerber is not fixing this problem."
4,Slick stuff.........,"I bought this reuseable parchment paper to cover my half sheet baking pans after I retired my non-stick bakeware due to the non-stick coating issues and the non-stick coming off here and there. (Not to mention that the old stuff would fill up with water when put in the dishwasher). These reuseable parchment papers work very well. Nothing has stuck to them yet, but I mostly do cookies. They wipe down easily and store right in my half sheet pans. There is but one but.....these parchment papers are made with PTFE, so if you want to stay away from that stuff, you might want to consider other products. After using these for dozens of cookies, I am very pleased with them."
3,"Freud ""invented"" psychoanalysis to please his parents!","This is a curiously psychoanalytic review for an author who thinks psychoanalysis is just about the greatest ""con"" of the 20th Century. Freud wanted to please his parents, and this meant inventing something that was radical on ""the surface,"" but is really just safe old Judeo-Chrisitan wine in new (pseudo) scientific bottles; thus Freud ""appeared"" radical, but in the end was a ""good old boy"" after all.There are more footnotes in this book than one can shake any kind of stick at, but most of them are quotes from other book reviews and other tertiary sources; it ends up as a ""fake scholarly"" piece on what the author calls a ""fake"" science. So why does Webster use psychoanalytic theories to discredit psychoananlysis"
2,Why Webster Was Wrong,"Any book that Anthony Storr calls original is suspect. Nowadays pompous titles are in vogue, presumably because they aid the sales, and this book, as far as I can tell, is selling very well indeed. After all, don't we all want to know exactly why Freud was wrong? Unfortunately Mr. Webster does not tell us much; his book mainly consists of recycled material from diverse sources, confusingly assembled, plus a pseudo-philosophical meditation at the end. Curiously it seems popular to bring in Darwin, who is on the chart of all the ""critics"" of Freud. another interesting fact: people who are most eager to attack Freud as a pseudoscientist today are English Professors... And finally, as John Forrester noted, none of these people encourages us to actually read Freud, and to find out things for ourselves. Is there a pattern in all this?"
1,This must actually be designed to be a non-working product,"There is no mechanism by which the guitar could possibly work. We just purchased it and it has A) No speaker in it, B) No cord to attach it from its hole to the hole in the microphone stand, and C) No instructions that tell you how to use the microphone stand speaker as the speaker for the guitar music to come through. We bought TWO and neither one even remotely worked. The package says it plays music and is an electric guitar but this is patently false advertising. We will be returning it and would like additional compensation for our time and our son's disappointment."
2,TOY IS VERY EDCATIONAL,"THIS TOY IS VERY EDCATIONAL FOR MY 4 1/2 YEAR OLD SON. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE WHEN CHRISTMAS CAME AND WE OPEN FOR THE FIRST TIME WE COULD NOT GET THE SREW OUT TO PUT THE BATTERY IN. THEIR WERE 5 FAMILY MEMBER TRY AND EVEN THE DEPARTMENT MANGER TRIED WHEN I WENT TO RETURN. I FEEL THAT TOYSRUS SHOULD SEND MY SON SOMETHING FOR HIS DISAPPIONTMENT ON CHRISTMAS DAY, IF IT'S NONTHING BUT A COUPON OFF HIS NEXT PURCHASE. WHY DON'T ASK THEM NOT TO PUT THE SREWS IN SO TIGHT. THANK YOU, I PRAY FOR YOUR COMPANY. GOD BLESS..SIGN A CONCERN PARENT.."
2,"Great toy, but not very sturdy","My 3 1/2 year old daughter received this as a Christmas present and was so excited to play with it. We figured out that to get it to work with all the sounds and drums you had to turn on the power button on the guitar as well as on the microphone stand. We loved that this guitar had real strings. However, my daughter didn't quite get the idea that the plastic screws to adjust the strings actually affected the sound the strings make, so she continually turned them, and I had to keep adjusting them. In doing so one of the plastic screws snapped in half, and now the string hangs loosely and can not be tightened. We also have a problem with keeping the microphone stand adjusted to the height we desire. It has a knob to tighten it that doesn't actually seem to do anything. Overall, it's not a horrible toy, but it definately does not live up to the Little Tikes name."
1,"I can't believe, everyone has the same problem!","This is so amazing......we also bought this guitar for Christmas and could not get the screws out. Not only that but, the mic stand broke as soon as it came out of the box. I too, returned it only to find that there were no more. I signed up to have it emailed when this item became available and upon reading these reviews and relooking at my own experience. I will not be buying this toy again. How disappointing! All my son wanted for Christmas was a guitar and this is what he got. Shame on Little Tikes!"
1,Very disappointed!,"We have purchased a ton of Little Tikes toys...all of which we were very pleased with. However, eventhough this toy is made my Kids Station, Little Tikes has put their name on it so the quality should be comparitive with their other toys...this is not! We are very disappointed at the cheap plastic and lousy ""noise"" that the microphone and guitar make. Little Tikes needs to stay away from musical instruments obviously!"
5,It IS Essential,"I approach each release of Oracle with trepidation simply because each release contains so many new features and with it a considerable amount of documentation.I think everyone who is considering Oracle 10g should definitely purchase Oracle Essentials - Oracle Database 10g. It succinctly gives the highlights of the database in general as well as specific new features in an easily digestable manner. It not only explains the parts and pieces of the database, but why and how they are used. This book is heaven sent for me. This compact book gives me everything I need to know in one terrific volume and encourages me to delve further in the specific areas I need to know.As for one of the authors, Bob Stackowiak, I have known him for many years and have always been impressed with his breadth of knowledge on the database. To recently discover that he is one of the authors of this book makes it all the more compelling to read.I highly recommend this book."
2,A Noisy Yell-fest,"I think the intent was to make an album that was high-energy and uplifting, but what we have here is just a big yell-fest. I think this is one of those things where you had to be there. The audience has been whipped up into ""putting their hands together"" and cheering which creates a lot of noise ... which you hear a lot of on the album ... constantly. And the band has to play loud to get over that noise. So the choir has to yell at the top of their lungs just to be heard. And the soloists have to do a lot of yelling to be heard.Maybe because this is live, the spirit was moving the choir to keep on repeating and hammering away at whatever the catchy part of the song is because that is the way live things go sometimes. So you get a LOT of repetition -- with the soloists trying to yell ever louder and more soulfully as the repetition grinds on. Everything is done to such excess that it all becomes a headache inducing mess."
5,Moment by moment account of one of battle of Tarawa,"The definitive book of the Pacific War along with ""Goodbye Darkness"" by William Manchester. Sherrod's ""Tarawa"" is to books what ""Saving Private Ryan"" is to the movies. Except Tarawa is real while many of the scenes in Saving Private Ryan are recreations of anecdotal incidents which took place on the beaches of Normandy. Sherrod's Tarawa is an actural account of the grisly battle for Betio, which cost the lives of almost 1,000 Americans and thousands of Japanese Marines. Sherrod's ""stream of conciousness"" is much more vivid andeasier to read than than most technical descriptions of the battle. Tarawa and the opening battle scene of Private Ryan almost compliment each other, especially with Sherrod's description of almost being able to ""reach out and touch a thousand bullets."""
1,watered down alcohol,I have ordered this perfume for my wife who already had some and loved it. What I received was a bottle of watered down alcohol--colored yellow in a Faubourg 24 container ---and when I tried to return it ---it was listed as a hazardous material and not returnable ----shame on Amazon---they need to do some quality control on thewi LLC partners---a $92 error in this economy HURTS!!!!!!!!
3,All 9 seasons of Dynasty distilled into one bottle,"This perfume smells like what you think of when you hear the word ""perfume"". If you mainly enjoy fragrances made in the last 5-10 years - those fruity sweet scents that smell like bath products - you'll hate this. If you're under 30, this might remind you more of what your mother would wear, if your mother is someone who attends posh parties and wears mink.It's famous for being a favorite of Princess Di, and is a complex and sophisticated scent. There are those who miss the days when perfume smelled like perfume and not vanilla candles; they'll love this. Sadly, I'm not one of them. To me, it smells like what I imagine soap opera stars would have worn in the 80s. By all means buy the small bottle before splurging on the large one."
2,I am too young for this stuff...,"I was SUPER excited to get this in the mail, and then I actually tried it on. BLEH I smelled like my mother in law. Which is fine if you are over 50 but it made me feel really old. The upside is it has quite a strong staying power. I had to take a bath and scrub up with soap to get the smell off. I wanted it to be elegant and but it was just gross."
2,Not worth the money,"I'm glad I bought the tiny bottle of this because I wouldn't purchase it again. For one thing, the little stopper is so difficult to get out that I ended up spilling a little of it.As for the fragrance, I've had better. It's one of those perfumes that smells different on everyone and on me it didn't seem to last long."
1,Manufacturing Defect,"I ordered this from Amazon and received a set with about half the pieces having noticeable pits or marks. Some of the pieces had a rusty groove running most of the length. The design itself was ok, but the table spoons (or dinner spoons I suppose according to the box) were extremely large and heavy. The spoon might not fit in a small person's mouth. It's almost as large as the included serving spoon. The large forks and knives were very heavy too because the handles are very thick and round. Tone your muscles while eating your soup!"
5,Fantastic Album,"I had been hearing the Seasons quite a bit on the radio over the summer, and I decided to buy the old Anthology CD from 1990. That only made me want more. So I bought an LP, and figured that even if the other songs sucked on this album, then at least I'd have ""Rag Doll"" and ""Ronnie"" and ""Save it For Me"". I didn't have to worry about that though because every song on this album is great. I especially think ""Huggin My Pillow"" coulda been a hit. I am only 16, my parents dont like Valli's music much, but me and my brother sure do. I greatly reccomend this record to any fan of the Four Seasons music."
5,A Ray of Pop Beauty from the Past,"Ah...possibly the most uniquely dynamic vocalist in pop music-- Frankie Valli-- doing some of Bob Gaudio's and Bob Crewe's most inspired tunes along with the original line-up: Nick Massi on bass vocals and bass guitar, Tommy DeVito on baritone vocals and guitar, Gaudio on keys and second tenor. An amazing sound these guys created. Only one flaw: the original album's playlist included ""On Broadway Tonight,"" the theme song to a short-lived sixties variety show hosted by Rudy Valley. It's been replaced by The Seasons' treatment of Cole Porter's ""I've Got You Under My Skin"" which, though great, has been heard a zillion times and can be found on any number of Seasons anthologies. I would have preferred having the TV theme song. It's a gem and I'd love to know where I could find a copy of it."
3,Czos Review,Mr. Nanny starring Hulk Hogan is quite literally so stupid it is funny. Really bad acting and a totally off the wall storyline make this worth viewing. If you like movies that you think are so bad their good you will like this one.
3,AN OK MOVIE FROM THE HULKSTER,"A FORMER WRESTLER [HULK HOGAN] TAKES A JOB BABYSITTING A RICH MAN'S KIDS WHO HAVE MADE EVERY OTHER BABYSITTER THEY EVER HAD QUIT THE JOB. FUNNY AT TIMES, BUT NOT ALWAYS ENTERTAINING. THIS IS AN OK MOVIE TO WATCH IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT TV WITH YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY OR IF YOU NEED A GOOD LAUGH. HOGAN DOESN'T DO TOO BAD IN THIS ONE."
1,The only reason to see this movie is Madeline Zima,"Hulk Hogan should stick to wrestling, at least in the ring he doesn't have to speak. Hasn't he ever heard of the wise phrase ""It is better to keep your mouth shut and raise doubt on your intelligence than it is to open it, and remove all doubt."" The only thing that keeps this movie from being a total fop is the cute and intelligent performance of Madeline Zima, the true star of the show. We love you Maddie. -Kate"
2,For Mother Love and Sherman Hemsley Only,"I gave this two stars for the two people who make this movie funny in my opinion. This movie is stupid because you see the same stuff these kids do in other movies. Home alone 1,2,3 and Dennis the menace spring to mind. I've owned this movie since I was 8 and to this day, I fast forward to the parts with Mother love and Sherman Hemsley. Mother love plays the sassy maid. You see why the kids didnt try to get rid of her. Sherman Hemsley plays Sean's old manager, Burt. These two really make the movie worth watching. Especially the scense when they are together. These kids needed to get they're [butted] kicked. Especially for what they did to the gym. They better thank God they didnt have my grandfather as they're father."
5,Hulk Hogan Twin Pack DVD,Both DVDs arrived in excellent shape. I really love watching Hulk Hogan in Suburban Commando. It's one of my all-time favorite comedies! Mr. Nanny is a good family movie too.
4,Have you ever heard of WW II?,"I just want to add a comment to the only two reviews [ Canada and Connecticut] I have read. It's maybe not the best Mankiewicz [ I would vote for ""Sleuth""], maybe not the best James Mason, but what is appalling in the reviews is that people talk about a talented thief operating in foreign embassy. God! You've never heard of the German spy whose code name was Cicero? This man has really existed, and the movie makes an accurate summary of his life. A thief! Sorry, it is not Cary Grant in ""How to catch a thief"". It is a real story. Maybe one day you'll come to believe that Anna Frank used to be a talented ""foreign"" writer only known for her diary. Sad. America won WWII, please educate yourself with ""Trial at Nuremberg"", ""The Odessa File"" and this very good movie about Cicero the spy."
1,Skip it!,"The film is excellent, but the Korean DVD is not. Horrid transfer, with blocked up blacks, washed out whites and overall soft image. Don't waste your money as I did. Why 20th Century-Fox Home Entertainment hasn't yet released this offically is a mystery, but I recommend writing to them and waiting."
3,silly predictable Nazi spy flick,"I adore James Mason but he is sleepwalking through this silly and predictable Nazi spy flick. (Could you not see the ending a mile away?) I can only imagine he did it for the paycheck. He seems bored silly, as was I. (I just picked up his autobiography here at Amazon so maybe I will find out.) But the film is worth seeing for the truly amazing scenery, all filmed on scene in Europe. It is stunning, thus the 3 stars."
3,Good product,"I have struggled finding simple garden tool storage. These are ok, but not great. It is not easy to put shovels on them and they are awkward to use. The lower hanging hook is the best feature. Maybe they are best for brooms and cleaning items."
4,Not bad for a B-Softcore flick.,"For those of you out there who recollect those awkward teenage years sneaking up late at night for a glimpse of late night Cinemax ""fun"", here's one worth checking out. For what this product is worth it's not bad. Sure there's the flimsy (at best) plot, the bad dialogue, worse script, and every actor/actress has about as much of a delivery with their lines as one would expect in a B-Softcore porn movie. The only thing going for it is the rather steamy scenes of ""action"" and the two female leads. I came across this film while diving in the ""dollar bin"" at my local video store for a movie to fill out my free-rental with ""Predators"". All in all, I could have come out worse."
3,worth checking out for Kim Yates,"This film made me a Kim Yates fan. She's tall, blonde, and hot, and her sex scene with Judy Thompson is one of the best in the soft-core genre. The rest of the film? Well, it has a sort of loopy appeal, but the production values leave a lot to be desired and detract from the viewing experience. Without Kim Yates, I'd be tempted to give it only one or one and a half stars."
4,Not bad...,"I really enjoyed this film. The plot was just ok but lets face it guys....do we really watch these kind of movies for the plot? If I wanted to watch a movie with a good plot I would get something that was directed by Ron Howard or Steven Spielberg.Anyway, Judy Thompson is really hot. And the blonde who plays her friend has a smoking body even though her face is only average. They share a very steamy sex scene that would give the dead a hard on. However, my favorite scene was Thompson's masturbation scene. The only knock on the movie was that we did not get to see enough of the professors wife. I would have liked to see her and Thompson do a sex scene alone together. I recommend this to every horny male out there!"
2,"Lousy low budget story, great softcore sex scenes.","Overall, a pretty bad film. The acting isn't terribly great, and the story is boring in the way that those late night Cinemax movies are boring, but like those late night Cinemax movies, it DOES have it's good points. Namely Judy Thompson and Kim Yates. Both are sexy, beautiful women and the softcore scenes with them are positively scorching."
3,"Kim Yates ""rides"" again.","First off, the girl on the cover isn't in the movie. Darn. Second, this is Kim Yates's picture. Her limitations as an actress show, but her skills as a softcore performer are on full display. She is second to none in this genre. Judy Thompson is the female lead, and if you like fake breasts that are too large, she's your cup of tea. There's a story to the picture, but I forget what it is. I have not forgotten how Kim lays it all out for you. This movie is must-have for Kim Yates fans. Naturally, get the Unrated version."
4,Husband,"My husband is very peticular about his curve in his ballcaps, this was a stocking stuffer for him this past christmas. All in all, I have to say I think was a nice surprise. He uses it on new caps to kind of break them in, and seems to be happy with it."
2,Designs May Vary - INDEED!,"When I saw, ""Children's Construction Hard Hat (Designs may vary)"", I thought that perhaps the sticker on the front of the ""Children's Construction Hat"" may be different than what I was seeing on the website. Um. Wrong. Instead of a construction hat, I received a Firefighter's Helmet...! While it is not worth returning, it forces me to go elsewhere to look for a construction hat. A firefighter's helmet doesn't quite go with the construction vest nor the tool workbench I intend on giving my nephew for his birthday. :) Just be warned. Had I read that ""design may vary"" meant you may not get a construction hat at all, I would have selected a different ""construction hat""."
3,Cute....But *REALLY* small!,"I purchased this hat before Halloween for my 3 year old's Halloween costume. Boy, was I wrong! The hat is really cute, and gets a lot of play at our house, but that's because my 18 month old daughter wears it! It wouldn't even go on my 3 year old's head!If you're ordering this hat for a very young child, then it's a great purchase...but if the child is much more than 18 months old, you'd be best advised to pass on this item and look elsewhere.I ended up finding a REAL builder's hard hat at a garage sale just a couple of days before Halloween! :)"
2,Another Hit for a little boy,"I bought this for my son to go with a tool belt. I LOVES this hat. THe first words out of his mouth when he wakes up are ""HaNDY MANNY""(TM) hat. Although this product is NOT trademarked with the Handy Manny series/logo nor is it advertised as such, it makes him feel like one of his heros. The inner band that sizes the hat tends to come undone, but it clips back in fairly easily. Overall, I am thrilled that my son is thrilled.Update: About 3 months after I bought this, the sizing straps inside the hat broke. It goes into the recycling bin this week."
3,construction hard hat,It does well for $5. Good range of head adjustment albiet the head strap is held by 4 slots so it is constantly coming out
2,Construction hat,"The hat was ok, the strap was a little bent and was a bit uncomfortable. It made a cute addition to the tool chest I gave to my nephew though."
2,not durable,"cute hat, adjustable band is a good feature, however, the hat cracked within one hour of my 2 year old playing with it."
4,Good post good price,This is a good solid workhorse seat post. The reason that I purchased this post is because it has a micro-adjustable seat clamp that allows me to get the correct angle on a variety of different saddles. This is a feature found on many of the high-end posts but few of the basic posts which typically rely on interlocking teeth in the seat clamp. I log about 120-150 miles per week on this post and I have not had any difficulties with the saddle slipping. Initial set-up of the post included greasing the bolt threads and washer to prevent galling and positioning the steel crescent washer in the proper orientation.
1,Unusable,"The seatpost needs an unusual amount of high tork to stay, otherwise the back of the saddle slides down. Even when the bolt is tightened practically to the point of stripping, it still slides back slightly once you sit on the saddle. So it's a shiny piece of aluminum, I'm ordering another seatpost. I'm not just putting down cheap components either, promax actually makes an even cheaper seatpost, which works fine. This one just doesn't work though, at all."
4,1-3,"I've listened to the whole CD a couple times or so, but the songs that really stick to my head are the first three. Hence they're the most often replayed in my CD player. ""My Friends Over You"" has a catchy chorus, though it sounds a little weird after the second chorus when the vocal sings without any instruments. He kind of sounds a bit off tuned, but ignoring that, this is a great song. I especially love the third song (I'm not sure if the title is really ""Sonny"" or ""Sorry."") cause whenever I hear it I have this scene plays in my head, and I guess you just have to be me to appreciate it."
5,Awesome Punk!,"ANFG's sound just keeps getting better and better every album. Definetly get this and their new ""Calalyst"" album. ROck on"
3,good intentions,"This cd is truly effective but without personnality, it sounds like green day sometimes, blink often and to other olders punkers"
3,Pretty good but could be better,"This is an awesome CD, with a few minor flaws. First of all, every track sounds the same. Honestly, if there was no pause in between songs you could probably mistake every track as the same song. Second, the album just gets a little boring after 2 or 3 songs. I think you should listen to this album in small doses, dont listen to the whole thing at once. Besides that, its a great CD with excellent drumwork, great guitar riffs, good bass and excellent lyrics. Theres even a few guitar solo/bridges (Sonny, Head On Collision) that I dont hear from some pop-punk bands (Simple Plan, Bowling For Soup...). Just because their on TRL doesn't mean their sellouts, I mean their current single All Downhill From Here is like in the top 5 on TRL, but at least theres some GOOD music on that countdown. Buy this if you like Blink-182 or Good Charlotte."
4,"Poppy, but Nothing Worse than the self-titled","Being a long-time NFG fan, I had the agony of watching the band turn from semi-hardcore kings (Nothing Gold Can Stay) to Blink-182 rip offs (self titled) in 2 years. But even though that was an unwelcome change, the self-titled cd still had its good parts.Which brings us to now, and NFG's newest offering Sticks and Stones. When I first saw it in the store I thought ""oh great the downward spiral continues"" but it's like the self-titled CD and might be a little bit harder too (see Singled-Out minus the corny intro, and Never Give Up). In comparison, Blink 182 went from bad (Enema) to worse (Take Off...) because of this mentality (hmmm Adam's Song was slow but it made us money, let's write another one just like it! cha-CHING!) But NFG sticked to their guns (sorta) and made a CD that doesn't continue a downfall into MTV and TRL poster boys (that's happening anyways, but don't blame the music)"
1,Zeppelin Beware......,"This is a rock n' roll masterpiece. My grandkids will be listening to this album some sixty years from now, and I can tell them all about how NFG created a cult following of 11 and 12 year old TRL teenyboppers. Get real.. this is NOt music. This is far from talented, creative, or tasteful. Everyone all at once jumps on the bandwagon and all the punk wannabes are hailing NFG as the greatest band ever. Yeah well, if you think this is punk, listen to THE CLASH, and then we'll see how ""Hard and heavy"" NFG is. This is a great example of music's gradual decline. Thank God we still have the underground scene, you know, the music that isnt on TRL. Anyway, enjoy this album, cuz believe me, ten years from now youll look back at this and wander what was I thinking...."
5,"+ N + F + G + - - - - A Review From a ""Soft-Core"" Punker...?","To be honest. I am not a ""Hard-core"" Punk listener... I can't stand songs with the constant drumming noise in the back. However, listening to ""Sticks and Stones"" I've enjoyed every track. It's a great CD and everyone should buy it. =D.My Favorite Tracks;- Forget My Name- Head on Collision- It's Been A Summer- My Friends Over You- Singled Out- Sonny- The Story So FarMy LEAST FAVORITE song was ""Something I Call Personality"" mostly because of the drums.. but as for the lyrics... they were entertaining. =DOverall it's a great CD.. from 1-10... it'd give it an 8."
4,All for the pop-punk,"Like many new NFG fans, I found this band on MTV2 and watched the ""My Friends Over You"" music video. I've always been a fan of an upbeat punk ever since I started listening to Blink182. Despite similarities, what did you expect? Punk sounds like punk no matter who is singing it- don't expect any great revelations. If you're looking for something to jump around to, let loose, and just have fun- this CD is worth your time. And, believe it or not, I've connected with the lyrics on several parallels; it just depends on your perspective."
4,Good,I think this a great album. Much better than their first. I definetly recomend it if you like punk/pop.
4,Good CD,"It's good stuff, I'll admit. I must say I was never a big fan of New Found Glory because of the apparent lack of talent (Come on, they make the same music that Green Day does, only with FIVE people instead of 3. Green Day even does it better, anyway.); however, I decided to get the CD because everyone I talked to would tell me how great it was. I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me. It isn't brilliant, it isn't very original, but it's a good, fun, rock record. If you like Blink 182 or Green Day, you might like this."
1,This CD sucks compared to the others!,"O.K. Now all you little posers out there who think that this album is good, shut up. New Found Glory's Nothing Gold Can Stay (NGCS) is one kick [tush] album. Then there was self titled, which wasn't terrible, then there was sticks and stones. Its a TRL album, its poppy, easy to anticipate, and it gets old after one run through listening to it. If you want to here New Found Glory buy NGCS. Thank you."
4,Love this NFG album,"Wow... I love this album... The album start whit the albums best song Understatement and following whit grat songs like My Friens over you, sonny, Head On Colision, Forget My Name, The Story So Far etc..."
1,Emo?,"First off, what is New Found Glory doing in the emo section. They are another blink 182. Another band that started out sort of punk, but then got a record deal and became so pop that rock stations won't even play their songs. Emo is music that makes you think, and sometimes, if it befits the circumstance, makes you cry. The only reason you should cry listening to New Found Glory is because you wasted [$$] dollars. The people at the record store ripped your heart out and then stepped on it. Write a poem about that, poser."
3,22 minutes of silence,"There's about 22 minutes of silence at the end of track 12 that keeps this CD from being a 4 star CD. If you have the patience to sit thru the silence, you are 'rewarded' by getting to listen to the guys screw around. It's one thing if you hide a bonus track, but to tease stupid nonsense is stupid--and somewhat insulting. If I wanted silence, I'd turn the stereo off.I just don't understand why they'd decide to do this--leave the gimmicks to the amateurs.All things considered, this is a good cd. The cover art is cool, but we don't really need to know who Sticks and Stones are. Subtlety is often sexier. Hey, take what you can get."
2,NFG Has Officially Sold Out,"I love NFG, but they have done what a lot of punk bands have done and that is sell out to the mainstream. If you people who gave them five stars actually listened to their original work like Nothing Gold Can Stay then you would realize that this [junk] that they just put out is nothing like what they use to make. I am very disappointed with the band. Dont buy this album if you liked the original NFG sound..."
3,I was dissapointed,"I had liked New Found Glory when I heard the song my Friends over You but I didn't like what the album offered. It was a big dissapointment. Jordan, the lead singer has a nasal voice that gets annoying after a few songs and the sounds from this album sound similiar to Blink 182. I still like My Friends over You and Head on Collision but the others on this album, for a lack of better words, suck."
2,BLAH BLAH BLAH.,"Probably the worst NFG cd, if youre looking for a good NFG cd, go for Nothing Gold Can Stay or S/T. So much better. better lyrics/music/talent."
3,"Starting to become less appealing to me, still a good band.","Although I try to stray from comparisions in my reviews, New Found Glory's first two full lenghts were much more appealing than ""Sticks and Stones."" NFG's newest offering is still a worthy effort, there are some definite keepers here. I guess the can't - miss - tracks were just too few for this album to be rated as high as thier ""S/T,"" and ""Nothing Gold Can Stay."" These guys can still play tunes as catchy as ever, but their poetic edge seems to be fading badly in this release. However, the blaring guitars don't quit and neither does Jordan's infectious vocal onslaught. If you are a fan, buy it. It's still good stuff. If you are just getting into them, you will probably rate this 5 stars. In my opinion, it is just not as good as they are capable."
4,awesome!,This is a GREAT cd in my opinion..it rox- all the songs have a different sound and are fun to sing along too! i totally reccomend this cd to anyone who likes this style of music..its so cool!
5,the croctinculin of a modern day emo band.,"the mere pistagurin is breathtaking. listening to jordan howel his inner most trecheries on tracks 2-7 sends me into a state of euphoria. this cd is not only a must buy but if you bought it you would vomit through the pain of your metatarsals! i give this my worst review ever, seven thumbs up. AMBIGUOUS!"
1,Some more Pop-Punk ...,What is this [junk]? Everyone from Blink 182 to Good Charlotte to this are a bunch of punk-posers. I'm not a hardcore punk fan but at least I can tell the difference between pop and punk. I'm tired of all these MTV poser bands. If you want to hear some real hardcore punk then go listen to Rancid or The Distillers.
2,Why oh why....,"Well...Mall punk was everywhere in 2002. Thanks to Blink182, we have 7,892 cute and cuddly bands whose music videos look like Saved By The Bell episodes. Silly, cute, safe, and goofy good times for the entire family! With Hot Topic accessories no less! Punk Ruuulez! These bands are the reason that punk is deader than Sid Vicious."
2,Came broken.,The case was completely shattered when I received this Cd. But luckily there was no damage to the CD itself and I don't usually keep the cases.
5,Sticks and Stones,"New Found Glory is deffinetly influenced by pop-punk bands like Greenday and Blink 182, but Sticks and Stones is one of the best, most compleate punk C.D.s you can get. The songs are light and up-tempo. All the tracks are good. My favorites are ""My Friends Over You"", ""Sonny"" and ""Forget my Name"". The band even throu in an extra disc of songs from up-and-coming punk bands. N.F.G ROCKS!"
4,"It's not punk, but it's good MUSIC","NFG's album 'Nothing Gold Can Stay"" is a classic for all emo/punk fans. And while ""Stick and Stones"" is nowhere near NFG's best, its FAR from horrible, in fact it's a really good CD filled from top to bottom with GOOD MUSIC, not necesarrily good punk. Tracks 1, 8, and 10 give a quick reminder of what NFG is capable of and what they used to be. The rest of the CD is filled with energetic music that is fun to sing and listen to (track 4 and 6 especially).So if you're in the mood for emo/punk ""Nothing Gold Can Stay"" is a must in the CD player, but if you want a variety of fun and energetic music, a bit slower than classic emo, then listening to, ""Sticks and Stones"" isn't a bad choice"
1,Honestly...,"do you trust someone's opinion that had THIS to say: ""NFG all i have to say is that u rock!! I love ur songs and lyrics!! Ur the best band ever!!"". skip ""Sticks and Stones"". if you're looking for something poppy and punky that doesn't sound like every other label-manufactured piece of trash, get one of New Found Glory's previous albums. better yet, go buy some Dirt Bike Annie, Rufio, Homegrown, or Sewing With Nancie. those bands are creative, a trait that's sorely lacking on this album."
5,An overall great album,"I enjoy listening to all kinds of music. But most of the time I find myself listening to punk rock music. I really enjoy listening to the guitar and the drums in songs. I also listen to the vocals and the words of the songs. That is why I believe that New Found Glory's, Sticks and Stones is a really great cd. It has alot of upbeat songs and a few slow songs. They mix it up quite a bit. My overall favorite song is ""Something I Call Personality"". It is a really great song and i really enjoyed the lyrics. I also enjoyed the beats of all of the songs and I would rate this cd at a 5. I just love how they are so original and they dont care what people think about them. You can tell this because there is a fat guy in their band. So if you are looking for a great sound and some originality then you should buy this cd."
5,nfg's best,"Sticks and Stones may be NFG's best cd yet. They keep impressing me. The cd is fun, and you can relate to the songs. In my opinion, Blink 182 should be opening for NFG, instead of vice versa."
4,"Talented vocals, good guitar playing, semi-great lyrics","I bought this CD in the hopes that this one was as good as their last. In a way, I was kinda disappointed. I was looking for more of a punk kinda album, but NFG seems to have mellowed out a little bit.Overall, the songs are great. Even though it wasn't a punk cd, it was still quality music. Almost all the songs are catchy, however, the lyrics can get a little cheesy. Overall, I think the song writing is poor. They're laced with cliche after cliche and it gets kind of annoying. All their songs talk about roughly the same thing. The lyrics seem to be more focused on the early high school audience, if not junior high.Hopefully on their next cd the guy who writes the songs finds more entertaining things to do than write his songs only about girls. And hopefully his song writing grows up as well.Other than some of the lyrics, the songs are really catchy and the music is downright good. Thanks for reading."
1,The worst new band out there...,"If these guys can get a record deal, anyone can. The lead singer may have the worst voice in rock, and the band isn't much better.Avoid this one at all costs."
1,Remember when they were A New Found Glory,"Is this Blink 182? Wait this is Blink 182? It's not? It's Blink 181! The only thing they are missing is the video where they look like Blink 182 but make fun of the video process. No wait they did that. New Found Glory creates a very forgettable pop record. Don't listen to hard kids, all that sugar will rot your teeth. It's not my cup of tea, then again less and less is these days. Check out The Used instead, it will do your ears good."
1,im cryin listenin 2 dis,i used 2 like bands such as nfg and blink 182 until i realized i was turning 2 a f^^ so just listen 2 real punk like the ramones or minor threat ok!
3,Guilty Pleasure?,"I never thought I would have bought this album. This band is quite a stretch from the Glassjaw, Tool, Deftones, The Used sort of music that I typically listen to. After I heard Head on Collision though, my attention was raised, so I decided to check out these guys. And so now NFG is my guilty pleasure CD, even though I'm not really feeling too guilty about it. Great production, sincere lyrics, (albeit whiney at times) and some very clean, solid guitar playing. It's a great CD to just throw in when you're driving around and don't really want to think about what you're listening to, which I find sort of refreshing. So I actually give it 3.5 stars. It's a well done album, just nothing new or mind blowing."
2,Ehhhh....,"This band could be really decent, but ends up seeming to just want to make a buck, and worse off is chad from Shai Hulud is in it."
2,if heard good things but i hated it,"im sorri ppl but i really didnt care for sticks and stones i just got it and have listend to it once i loved the song my friends over you but most of the cd's songs had horrible lyrics that just didnt go w/ the music like there self titled lp i like nothing gold can say the most i have now every NFG album and i perticuarly liked them better with the ""A"" i dunno maybe the whole writing about girls thing worked better for me then i thought im sorri if i sound poppy because i hate all pop punk bands exsept nfg and gc but i really am disappointed in sticks and stones and the only reason i gave it 2 stars was because of the epiphany of a last song ""The Story So Far"" has been one of the best songs ive heard recently and well the hidden track was phuni as hell"
5,Who Isnt Going To Buy This ?,"When I bought this cd I put it in my cd player and was amazed.Well I knew I would be after I bought theyre self-titled album. The songs on this are amazing! My opinion on this album is its pretty good for 13 bucks. My favorite songs are My friends over you,Singled out,The story so far,and Forget my name. If you you want to be amazed with NFG buy Sticks And Stones"
5,NFG kicks [butt],every song on this cd is amazing. these guys can play amazing punk rock. go buy this cd now
3,Not worth getting...,"PUNK ROCKERS: You should have the intelligence to stay away from this CD.Pop punkers: If you want to own a NFG CD, don't get this one, get their self-titled. Although a couple of songs are okay and catchy, it's nothign compared to their older works.Mainstream fans: This CD is for you! Full of poppish rock songs about breakups! If you like GC or Simple Plan, this CD is a must have!P.S.: I can never watch any of their music videos. Not only the videos are bad, the guys are... not very good-looking... REALLY ugly... I can't look at him for more than 3 sec."
3,"New Found Glory, Different?","As a punk rock fan, I could tell you that NFG has gone almost completely pop and has sold out big time. But since I have a open mind to music I still accept and like their music. However, anyone out there who was a fan of ""Nothing Gold Can Stay"", ""It's All About The Girls"", or even ""From Your Screen To Your Stereo"" will not like this album because of its lack of actual punk beats, stops, and rythms. For those of you who loved the Self-Titled, you'll love this album. In my opinion it's better than their self titled because they actually went a little more original this time around. The most punk tracks on this CD are ""Never Give Up"" and ""Something I call Personality"". Hope I was helpfull!"
4,Really Catchy...,"Everything on here is catchy...seriously, you'll be singing along to every track. The Standouts Include: Sonny, The Story so Far, Understatement and Its Been A Summer...not to mention The Lead Single My Friends Over You..."
4,It's good,"I'm just going to review each song...1. Understatement: The best opener to an album I've ever heard. 5/52. My Friends Over You: Cool, but gets a little annoying after a while. 4/53. Sonny: The music is good, but the lyrics are what really stand out. 4/54. Something I Call Personalitty: Meh. 3/55.Head on Collision: Cool, but should have been called ""Bruised and Broken"". 4/56. It's Been A Summer: Extremely catchy. 5/57. Forget My Name: One of the best NFG songs ever! 5/58. Never Give Up: Yes, 3 good songs in a row. 5/59. The Great Houdini: Don't see what it has to do with Houdini, but it's good. 4/510. Singled Out: Stupid lyrics, ""Why did you have to go and make me say these things about you?"" What? Someone can't make you say things. 3/511. Belated: The chorus makes up for the wierd 2nd verse.12. Story So far: Kind of forgettable, and the hidden track is pretty lame. 4/5Overall, I have mixed emotions for this album, fans of NFG will like it."
2,Uninspired,"I bought the new NFG album ""sticks and stones"" expecting them to mature from there breakup, revenge type, attitudes, but all we got was the same subject matter as both ""nothing gold can stay"" and ""self titled"", theres only a few good songs, but i dont even like them enough to remember there names first hand, im pretty sure they are numbers 3 and 8, but whatever, it will be in my cd player on and off for the next few months but after that it will disappear into oblivion with drowning pool, sum41, and every kid rock album every made. Its just uninspired, and its getting old."
1,"I'm saddened, again.","I feel bad for most kids and the music industry. We have touched kids with candy that rots their teeth and now music that rots, well music. Some albums need to be made to be critiqued and this one and the rest of theirs, and the rest of their buddies, buddies, buddies albums sadden me. I really do feel sick that these guys are the future. Smart kids though, really got some dough. I can't blaim them. I really can't, but it still makes me suicidal sometimes, knowing that this isn't a bad dream and that this is reality.Well, I'll never let my uncle Jim buy me a cd ever again. I'll just politely ask for the receipt or for some cash next time."
2,Crash and burn,"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh this Cd what can i say, its just bad. First the lead singer so called vocalist is not much of 1 because he sounds like he just came off the street.He aslo sounds like a girl with a really high voice. All the songs sound the same with ok lyrics. Some of the songs are good like ""head on collision"" and ""my friends over you"" but thats about it. So if you like good music i suggest you stay as far away from this Cd as you can."
3,HMMMM....,"I origoinally got this cd because of some online quiz that recomended it 2 me. It's ok... but gets annoying really fast. Its sounds IDENTICAL. Its not a cd you can listen to from beginning to end, cuz if you do ull go crazy. its ok to listen to 1 or 2 songs at once, thts about it. If you like peticular songs, you can buy it, but its hard to get into any new songs while listening to this. Ide say tape the songs when you hear them on the radio."
4,Pretty good stuff,"The songs are kind of repetitive in subject, but the music is good. I enjoyed this cd very much. There's also a hidden track at the end. Don't listen to this when you're home alone! It'd pretty freaky. I do recommend this cd to anyone who likes the boy band punk tho. By the way, these guys put on an awesome concert that's way better than the cd."
4,"""Sticks And Stones"" make Stars","New Found Glory an established punk/emo band rocks new tunes to their latest album ""Sticks And Stones"". The familiar voices and always uplifting tempos have once again caught the attentions of all punk and pop fans alike. Just like the music of Blink 182 the use of power chords and hammering drum percussions keep the beatof the CD going. Their only downfall in their new CD is no variety. Meaning that they continually sing liyrics of some perfect girl, New Found Glory paints pictures referring to themselves as one person being disappointed by this girl or wanting to do anything for her. Most of the tracks follow this format and rarely has the listener uninterested at all. A must hear from their CD are ""Forget My Name"", a song on the disappointment of a deep and broken relationship and ""The Great Houdini"", which refers to the trivial quest to be great in ""her"" eyes. New Found Glory rocks again and again."
3,"common boys, you can do better","jordan's emotion is gone, this record is overproduced, musicianship is garbage, this cd doesnt really havve anything going for it. if it wasnt for a few catchy (although way too pop)tunes like ""my friends over you"" this would be the biggest waste of money ever. Its like the title of NFG's frist album, i guess ""notihng gold can stay"""
2,New Found Glory Sticks and Stones,"I am a great fan of punk and pop punk and this can only be seen as a dissapointment. They are trying so hard to be blink 182 but they simply dont have the tunes. Every song is a samey and dull affair with a bad chorus other than ""my friends over you"" which is New Found Glory at their bouncy and perky best. Everything is perfectly polished with some decent guitar hooks but nothing really stands out as great or indeed good. Sadly New Found Glory sound like washed up punk wannabes....."
3,Definitely NOT what i expected,"Before buying Sticks and Stones, i was pretty optimistic. i had heard head on collision before, and i was like yeah, cool, whatever ill buy the CD. my friends like the CD, so i got it. I started listening, and after listening to the CD once through, i was truly disappointed. Jordan sounds more like some whiney pop singer than a true punk rocker. the guitar is good though, but jordans nasty voice hangs over everything. even though the songs are pretty catchy, it doesnt meant they're good. because of this annoying CD, jordan's scratchy, hip hop, whiney voice goes around with me wherever i go, and its starting to piss me off. if you liked nfg's earlier album, then buy sticks and stones. but if you're a fan of true punk rock, go with a blink 182 CD or Sum 41- real bands."
5,New Found Glory at their best!!!,"Wow, this CD is definatly better than their last, if that was even possible. It sounds more hardcore than the last, which is so much better, giving it a vibe of their live shows. This CD is simply amazing, all the songs are equally incredable. Jordan's vocals are stronger and the rest of the bands instrument playing has improved as well. Songs that immediately caught my attention were ""Understatment"" ""Sonny"" ""Something I Call Personality"" ""Forget My Name"" ""Singled Out"" and ""Belated"". But don't get me wrong, all the songs are energetic and fun to sing along and listen to. it deserves all 5 stars. Go buy this CD, you won't be sorry."
5,new found glory is amazing,If you like the NFG self titled album BUY THIS! I bought it the day it came out and i was not upset! There are so many good songs on this cd i do not have time to put them all down!
1,My garbage man wouldn't even pick it up,"Garbage. I really don't care if these guys sold out or not. Even if you sell out you make a record with a few decent tracks. This one lacks any creativity. It's all whiny about how their girl doesn't love them anymore and wah wah wah. Someone needs to inform these guys that they're allowed to have input on the making of their own record, because it sure doesn't sound like they did."
5,Awesome Album,This is one of the best albums ever! Most of the good albums today have parental advisory slapped on the album. This is a good album and it doesn't have any bad words! I recommended to everyone.
2,corporate rock,"this my friends, is corporate rock at its best... the 15 year old girls and boys call it ""punk."" They must be punks they have blue hair and tattoos. the only song worth listening to is ""its been a summer."" My friends over you is ok, but it's played out now. And finally... those of you who think they have ""hard and heavy"" guitar riffs, i have got two words for yall GOOD RIDDANCE."
2,I expected more,"NFG is one of my favorte groups. I got hooked after listening to thier self titled release, which is one of the best I've ever heard. My hopes were high when I first got Sticks and Stones, but after a few listens I felt that the CD as a whole was kinda weak. It has its high points with Understatement (my favorite on the disc), My Friends Over You and Forget My Name. Other OK songs are It's Been a Summer, Something I Call Personality and Singled Out. Everything else is pretty much filler. This CD has a much different feel than their previous albums, and it seems as if they have lost a lot of the energy in their songs and have replaced it with emotion. Unless you're a [real] fan and are [eager] to buy the CD, just download these songs and you'll be satisfied."
3,Ok but not as good as self titled,"well yeah,i bought ""sticks and stones"" because i was totally convinced that it would be awesome. NFG started off nice with ""understatement"" but after the first few songs things got kind of ,well, annoying. it all sounded the same. i have nothing against NFG, im even going to one of their october shows, but if your gonna get into them, buy their self titled cd."
5,BEST CD EVER!!,"I'm a big fan of groups like Blink 182, Sum 41, and Greenday. But now, I think my new favorite band is New Found Glory. This CD is great. Every single song on it is wonderful. The lyrics are really cool and the the guitar, bass, and drums parts are like nothing I've heard before. Even though they have their own uniqe sound, New Found Glory reminds me alot of Sum 41 and Boxcar Racer. Another cool part about Sticks and Stones is that if you put it in your computer, you can get some interesting stuff about the band. If you're a fan of Blink, Sum 41, or Boxcar Racer, you'll definetly love this CD."
4,NFG,"When i heard NFG for the first time it was in concert, i loved them so i bought one of there cds,when this one came out i was like ""oh my god its gonna rock"" but i was really disappointed, its good and all, but it isnt nearly as good as the first one. I would suggest buying it, but only if you have like there older ones."
3,2nd best CD I own-I own a lot,Great cd. I bought it for the song- My Friends Over You but the rest of the cd is great. THe best CD I own is Linkin Park Hybrid Theory.I recommend this cd to anyone!
1,"THIS PEOPLE ARE NOT PUNK, THEY'RE POP.","THIS PEOPLE ARE WHAT EVERY PUNK FEARS, A SONG SO POPPY THAT PREPS CAN LISTEN TO IT, LABELED PUNK, THESE PEOPLE ARE RUINING PUNK ROCK"
1,I'd give it a zero if i could,"My little brother who is 14 listens to this cd at least once a day and i told him if he wanted to become a man he should at least listen to some green day, rancid, nofx or screeching weasel. I mean at the very least. Me and him have recently taken a baseball bat to all new found glory, sum 41, simple plan, and blink 182 album we could find. i think i remmeber liking one or two songs on this cd to tell you the truth , it was the one with matt skiba on it from alkaline trio. the lead singers voice is just annoying these guys and bands like them are the boy bands of punk rock theyre not even political or interesting all about girls."
2,Not what you think your getting--Check carefully!!,"If you are purchasing this for a class, I highly recommend that you purchase the package from the schools bookstore. I tried to purchase all of the ""parts"" on amazon and because the discriptions are sketchy I ended up spending more trying to get all that I needed for the class than I would have. For instance they split the CD that normally comes with the book seperatly, and they split the SAM CDs from the student manual. When the SAM CDs arrived they had been opened and were missing half the CD's (ordered from Amazon), although Amazon is fixing it with no fuss, the shipping time means that I will not have the CD's in time for class, and I have to HOPE the next ones they send are complete!"
4,great used book,"affordable and in decent condition! it's been a huge help for a student who cant afford new books. there is some writing in it, but that was mentioned in the description."
4,Contacts: Langue et culture francaises 8th ed.,"I love this textbook for speaking French because it integrates French history, culture, grammar and vocabulary with lots of pictures and exercises. The online workbook is a fabulous addition as well."
3,review,"the book was what i was looking for. however it did not have the CD's that i was expecting it to come with, since i spent the extra money to purchased it new."
3,.,"I bought this used and when it came, some most of the pages were written with ink. That bothered me a little but the writing was small so it didn't matter that much. Aside from that the book was almost new."
1,Too Expensive!,"This is just a book for beginners and doesn't offer anything more than other French books that are written for the same purpose.If you have a choice of buying a cheaper book, go for that. The price does not necessarily mean that the book is better. However, it might mean that your instructor has got ""some incentives"" to ask you buy this specific book and not a less expensive one."
1,Not worth the money.,"I originally bought this book because I thought that the title implied there would be an extensive discussion about how the vegan way of eating leads to improved health. Was I wrong! There were only four or five pages discussing this issue and then the introduction went into a couple of more pages describing whole ingredients. The rest of the book is devoted to photographs (not very attractive), a small number of recipes, and lots of empty space. Only one or two recipes even remotely appealed to me. All in all I felt that it was not worth the $19.95 price tag."
5,"Tasty recipes, well written, informative.","I found the recipes in this book to be very flavorful, and mostly simple to make. This book is great for everyone - whether or not you adhere to a vegan regime. The vegetable recipes and banana oat ""cookies"" were my favorite.The sections regarding ingredients which may be unfamiliar are well written and informative, as is the ""shopping list,"" which helps to organize your first trip to the health food store."
2,Soy heavy and not strictly vegan,"This book is light on information about the health benefits of a vegan diet and the recipes are very dependent on soy products. Many people (myself included) have soy allergies or intolerances and including so much soy in a ""healing"" cookbook seems a bit misguided.Quite a number of the recipes use honey as a sweetener and this is not an ingredient that strict vegans would use.The good points about this book are that the recipes use lots of fresh produce and they don't use refined sugars or starches."
1,math review terrible,"i agree with the original posting.after purchasing this book,it looks like the authors and editors failed to review their own work.questions full of errors ( their explanations showed they transposed numbers etc.)only AFTER one works thru the problem,then goes to their explanation to find out the original question is not answered !i would opt for a different book.besides this book is too outdated !!"
4,Hammers home the terms!,"I found this book extremely helpful when studying for the state exam. I like the quick overview of each section and love the false friends definitions. There are so many new terms to learn! Words you'd never heard of before or words that you thought you knew but in real estate world, they hold totally different meanings! This book really helps to hammer those terms home!!Yes, I agree with the other reviewers that there are quite a few errors in the questions and/or answers. But it is still a very worthwhile investment, in my opinion! I like the set up and format of the book too- very user friendly.I recommended it to several people in my class and they all purchase it and found it very helpful as well.I wish they would update it, that's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5."
5,"""Get your stinking paws off of me...""","This is one of Charlton Heston's last great performances. The film, though filled with action, also has an intelligence to it, and a slow, methodical style that is characteristic of the good science fiction movies of the era that ended with Star Trek II. Space explorers crash-land on an unknown planet, struggle to find food and water, and then encounter a band of mute humans, and then the dominant species on the planet: apes. It was a mirror to race relations in the 1960s, and also a reflection of the clash between scientific and religious thought on the origin of our species, and finally also a speculative tale of man's own fate, should mankind not master the worst parts of its nature."
5,Amazing Blu-ray release,This looks as good or better than any BR I own...Right up there with the Dark Knight..WOWWhat the heck happened to the BR release of HEAT and Goodfellas.This is a 40 year old movie and it is literally amazing..Stellar!
5,It's a madhouse. A maaaadhooouuuuse!,"Unbelievable breakthrough sci-fi movie from 1968. Flawless conception from Twilight Zone writer and guide Rod Sirling. I remember watching this for the first time when I was about 11 and I was just floored. Still a great ride 17 years later and an essential item for any sci-fi movie fan. Great use of sci-fi in exploring cultural and philisophical issues of great proportions and magnitude. Good effects for 1968, no CGI or advanced makeup and the makeup and sets don't look dated. Great story, characters, action, and a mind-shattering ending, though the stupid DVD cover gives it away! I know any adult probably knows the ending, but why blow it for younger viewers? Charleton Heston in his prime with Linda Harrison as a devoted, mute supermodel love slave. No time for love scenes with this tight, well-constructed sci-fi action drama.-- JJ Timmins"
4,ape,in this one some astronauts are in suspended animation.they come out and go down to some strange planet.charelston heston is in it.whos he?guess that was before my time.the kids will think the apes are funny.i cant tell if its low budget because all those old movies look low budget.it is the best of the set which has many many sequels.it is also better than the tim burton version.the very last scene is very well acted and one of my favorite scenes ever.thee are some chicks about but its hard to tell that they are as sexy as they are through all the grime and dirt from the forest world they live in.its an excellent film.
2,The movie is anamorphic but the extras are just retread....,"It's nice to see that this movie is finally being released as an animorphic widescreen version, but ALL of the extras are already available on the BEHIND THE PLANET OF THE APES 2 DVD set. So those of us fans that already bought the Behind set are getting corn-holed. Buhahah... it figures.And while were on the subject... hows about letting us have the damned ANIMATED Planet of the Apes series on DVD already!! Geez!"
5,Planet of the Apes,"This was the original, and the best one of all of them. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It held your interest from the beginning to the end."
5,timeless,"I had forgotten just how good this movie really is. Sure they got relativity a little skewed, and no one questioned English speaking apes light years from Earth, but they got prejudice, greed and religious intolerance very very correct. I've become a fan of Dr. Zaius, who had all the best lines and carried the nature of man in his pocket - ""Beware the beast man for he is the devil's pawn. Alone among god's primates, he kills for sport, or lust, or greed. Yea, he will murder his brother to poses his brother's land. Let him not breed in great numbers, for he will make a desert of his home and yours. Shun him. Drive him back into his jungle lair. For he is the harbinger of death."""
4,Sci-Fi Fantasy Still Holds Up,"Unlike alot of the sc-fi films from the sixties with a message, ""Planet of the Apes"" still holds up remarkably well due to the strength of it's story, production values, and the acting. The film has a coherent narrative which was definitely lacking in Tim Burton's version. The world in which the apes inhabit is richly imagined. The basic premise of man's inhumanity to itself and other creatures may be heavy-handed at times but not overly so. The ape make-up is breathtaking and does not impede the actors sporting it. Director Franklin J. Schaffner has assembled a first-rate cast with Charlton Heston solid as the astronaut, Taylor, Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter give superb performances as the sympathetic ape scientists Cornelius and Zira and Maurice Evans appropriately crotchety as head ape scientist Dr. Zaius. Linda Harrison, wife of a then Fox executive, is visually stunning as Nova, the human girl the apes attempt to mate with Taylor."
5,I'll be a monkey's uncle!,Short and sweet? This movie is fantastic. Much better than the remake starring Mark Walburg (liked him better in Four Brothers). This one is a classic and spawned a franchise. The others in the series weren't as good but are watchable. Nuff said...
5,Most Intelligent Movie I Have Seen In A While.,I loved this movie. It is about four astronouts who crash on to a mysterious planet. All of them die in the first 20 minutes except for Charlie Heston who is captured by the natives. People-like apes. The ending is great and this is a must have. I give it *scraches a five onto a prison cell wall* FIVE STARS!
1,shlock,"This movie is valuable as an advertisement for the brilliant novel of the same title (that is, of the same title in English translation--it was originally published in English as ""Monkey Planet""). It has no other value. Charleton Heston is pathetic (as always) in the lead."
1,Should have stuck to the original story.,"This movie could have been so much better, as could the remake.If you have actually read the Pierre Boulle novel, and seen Rod Serlingsoriginal draft and Artur P Jacobs pre-production artwork, you can really appreciate what a disaster the final outcome was.In the behind the PLanet of the Apes dvd, there is the original screentest showing Edward G Robinson as Zaius, the Orangutan makeup was so much better, than waht eventually turned up.This film really needs to be made the way it was intended, with the astronauts landing on a parralel world, where the apes are technologically advanced.Actually the ending of Burtons remake stuck pretty true to Boulles ending of the planet of the apes."
2,Not that great!,This movie was ok. I felt that the content could have been more well-presented. It seemed to drag on in certain parts.
2,"I'm sorry, this movie is just bad.","Even though I was old enough to have seen the original movie in theatres, I never did. I finally saw it on dvd because the critic in Entertainment Weekly talked about how great the ""surprise ending"" was.I'll keep this short. You'd have to be pretty dim to buy into the premise that Heston's character......supposedly a scientist.....wouldn't at least suspect that he might be on earth. There was so much evidence to that effect. So the ending is not a surprise at all. You can see it coming hours away. Aside from that, the movie is just very lame. I had a tough time forcing myself to watch it all the way through. Bad acting, bad dialog, bad plot. Nuff said. You're either with me or against me..:-).........p.s. I find it amusing the way all the POTA lovers out there can only express their hurt by indicating that my review was not helpful. Boo hoo!"
5,A CLASSIC!,"1968 version of Planet of the Apes, this is the one that started it all. Received the DVD in a prompt manner. Enjoyed watching it again after seeing it for the first time when it came out and I was in high school. Quality of the picture is very good as is the sound. It's the best of the Planet of the Apes movies, though I really enjoyed Rise of the Planet of the Apes which came out recently. Charleton Heston is excellent and, for its time, the special effects are outstanding. If you never saw the movie and want to see it again, this is a very worthwhile buy."
5,Good old movie,"Good movie. Nothing to do with that piece of garbage of the remake (2011). This movie is not heavy in special effects, nevertheless is a good movie and more important is the original. The quality of the Cd is good. Worth having it in any collection."
5,Supierior grade sci-fi adventure!,"I saw this movie for the first time when I was 12.(long after it's inital release in the theater). One thing I love more than anything is a good sci-fi adventure. This one will get your adrenalin pumping and has an excellent story and excellent cast. Charlton Heston's character is a bit of a super-hero because he can fight apes, and we all know apes are many times stronger and quicker than men. The new movie depicts this more accurately, but is not near as good as this original 1968 version with Heston, Roddy McDowell(an exellent ape) and Kim Hunter(the most sympathetic of chimpanzees)as well as Maurice Evens(whom you love to hate) and many others too numerous to mention."
5,"It gives an ""what if""","WOW. What if those apes took over? What if those apes got smart? What would happen? This is a truely awesome movie. I mean when ""Bright Eyes"" finds out it was earth after all, I could only imagine what he felt. It gives the messge to be careful of science and not to always take a smart pet into ur house. Like in the sequals. THE APES ARE COMMING! I cant wait for the remake this summer!"
5,Still chillingly effective,"Charlton Heston is simply great as the asronaut Taylor. His face perfectly conveys the feelings Taylor is having throughout the whole film. He starts out hating the human race, then becomes their principal defender, and finally sees his original feelings borne out in the shocker conclusion that I won't dare give away. The very underrated Roddy McDowal shines through all the makeup, and in fact all the ape actors are excellant. I don't think the film is anti-religious or anti-government because all the apes' assertions are actually proved true. Too bad the budget couldn't create the technologically advanced world of the book, but it's still a good ride."
5,AN ASTONAUT IS CAUGHT IN A WORLD TURNED UPSIDE - DOWN,"One the BEST sci-fi films ever made. Co-written by Rod (THE TWILIGHT ZONE) Serling, this classic film is based on the novel by Pierre Boulle. NOT only to it spawn 4 sequels but also a live action and animated series. The startling conclusion at the end of the film STILL sends chills down my spine. [Charlton Heston's character sees the STATUE OF LIBERTY 1/2 way submergered in the sand, and comes to the STARTLING CONCLUSION that this strange planet is Earth]. The AMAZING ape make-up, earned creator John Chambers a special Academy Award, BEFORE make-up effects became a category. I can't wait for the Arnold Schwarzenegger remake to be completed and released."
1,Dummy,"The title of this book should read ""The Autobiography of a Technical Writer."" Sheryl Lindsell-Roberts' career, although auspicious indeed, is not what I was looking for in a manual. I became so exhausted reading her personal triumphs that I decided not to become a technical writer. The book contains nothing of substance, nor does it give any pertinent information on the realities of skills necessary (less ""soft skills"")for a junior writer to crack the program-specific job market."
2,Citi's are NOT Cables to Go or as pictured,"I got three different colors from Citi (7 ft model)They were NOT as pictured.Instead of a very flexible snagfree tab, they had a tiny hard nob in its place.Much harder to release ... it did release though.No markings of any sort stating that they were Cables to Go.I have others that are Cables to go and they were as pictured with a flexible snagfree tab that worked great.Bottom line is that Citi sent a different item, the Cables to go as pictured are great."
5,Awesome!!!!!,"I never got the chance to really dig into Mission Hill before, but I had a faint memory that it was nice then I found it at a really decent price so I bought it. Wow, such a good show!! very well designed, the characters very well thought and developed, interesting themes, etc. I just loved it! I'd have loved to see more seasons of this show but like always, it seems that very few good shows survive the first season."
5,mission hill? mission impossibly awsome,"Mission Hill hits my sweet spot.This is more an exploration of passing into adulthood than situation comedy. Andy and his little brother are both stuck in the place between childhood and adult hood. A sweet place to be. A point in life where we are optamistic about the future, I want to be a cartoonist, I want to go to an ivy league collage, but we get stuck in the quagmire that is day to day life. Do we write a resume or get trashed with the hot chick down the street?I love the mocking tones against Mtv. Mtv has no substance. Then they pose the question, what if you were offered a spot on Mtv? Would you turn it down? Hell no is the answer.The crappy job with a sleazy boss. Then you become the boss.anyway I could go on. If this sounds like the show that scratches you where you itch then you must have it. It will validate your existance. But if your one of ""them"" pretend you never saw it and keep walking..."
5,A Great Series that was cut short...,"I loved this show. The animation was unique and fit the show, and everything from the voices to the music just 'felt right'.I wish this show was still on the air. And adult swim has long since stopped showing the reruns. I'm very grateful they brought this to DVD."
3,Some people found this offensive.,Some people found this cartoon offensive. That's probably why they only made thirteen episodes of it. They may have found it offensive because God drank beer in it. I didn't find this cartoon offensive. This cartoon was good but it was no Family Guy.
5,Extremely satisfied,"i am extremely satisfied with this product and the ""relationship"" with this seller. They were very pleasant to do business with. Product was in the exact condition they described it as. Am very pleased."
4,yo this is a great dvd to buy,i think this a good dvd collector set to buy but are they ever going to make a second season or volume write me brett.thecool@hotmail.com
3,"Great series, poor production on dvd's.","This series is a great, although it ended before its time. The Daniel Clowes-esque animation is terrific. If only the studio could do a Ghost World animated film :(... but anyway, the episodes are pretty funny and offer some pretty good choices. Sometimes, this show's a filler on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, which is where I got into it a few years back. I like the cast of characters immensely.That said, I can't 5 star this because the production of the DVD's seems like a common problem these days: unfinished and/or poor surfacing during the production. Both of my discs arrived and most of the episodes play fine, but due to a faint semi circle error on each disc, I had to get them resurfaced to watch an episode on each disc, and crappy disc production should be a factor on reviewing any DVD."
4,Excellent Taste-but not really a meal,"A great treat for between meal snacks. The protein makes it filling, and the flavor cures the craving. The only think keeping it from being a 5 star treat is the fact that it advertises itself as a meal replacement. Not quite filling enough for me."
1,Wrong size bars sent,"The first shipment was just as ordered. This last shipment was not the same....the bars went from 1.59 ounce to 0.9 ounce. The bar says chocolate peanut - not chocolate peanut butter. The picture looks the same on the packages. I am very disappointed in this shipment. We opened all the boxes before we realized the difference, so we couldn't send them back."
4,OK But Not Outstanding,"These bars aren't ""awful,"" but they're not ""fantastic,"" either. They're kinda gooey, and kinda small. I ended up eating two at a time, so I won't be buying them again. I prefer the larger bars with a little crunch."
1,Has white fungus on chocolate,The black chocolate on top is whitish on edges. It looks like old chocolate or like they store these bars in a war place so that chocolate get old and white fungus starts growing on it.
1,Watch out!,"This looks like a great phone, but I wouldn't know. I've ordered this phone twice and have yet to get the correct one. They keep sending me a handset that can't be used without a base unit. It's not even an expansion unit for THIS PHONE, but for another phone altogether! Obviously Amazon is having some trouble with this model number, so I'd stay away if I were you. Order at your own risk!"
3,"GREAT early ""prog/pub rock""","As in the title, no question. But buy the three-CD set which includes all the first three albums, because - well, you're getting GREAT rock and roll here but what you're paying for is a back cover-picture of Bill Wyman (the band's producer) relieving himself. I mean, you know, your money..."
4,SUMMARY,"Covers detection of insect infestation, methods of control including chemical and biological control, and detailed information on specific types of insects. Includes chapters on leaf-eating insects, sucking insects, meristematic insects, wood destroying insects that effect dead trees and logs, and arthropods. Includes black and white photos and diagrams of both insects AND the type of damage they do. detailed bibliography at end of each chapter."
1,ProComm Plus DOES NOT work with Windows XP,"ProComm Plus DOES NOT work with Windows XP, You can make it dial, but you cannot use a .dir file, aspects, or scripts."
2,Procomm Plus is Vaporware,"You should know that this product is no longer supported. The last build was in 1999. At the time of writing this, that is almost ten years old.In '99, Google was just getting started, Windows XP was not yet released, and most importantly, SSH wasn't used. So, no SSH with this software."
4,Super old software for super old systems,"This software isn't secure, doesn't work well with current operating systems, and is completely essential for maintaining a connection to some old systems. I use this to capture a data stream from a fire alarm system that used to output to a serial printer.It does what it says, it's old, if you're looking for it, you'll know if it will meet your needs.Four stars instead of 5 because it would be helpful to update this software, even though the market is probably pretty small."
2,"If you have no internet, this will help...some","This book is now 3 years old. The info is getting more outdated by the day. Casa particulares sites are easy to find. You pay an extra 10$ per day but you can make reservations on line with little trouble. The CPs are now taxed and regulated and easy to find by virtue of the blue and white triangles the display. His book on Havana isn't much better even though it is a new edition. Unless you're a technophobe, stick with the internet and print out what you need. The best part of both books are the maps for getting oneself oriented. I find out in two months how much updating they need as far as points of reference."
4,A GUIDE WORTHY OF THE NAME,"We just returned from Cuba, using this guide and one by Knopf which we found useless. This Moon guide was accurate, broadening, perceptive, comprehensive, and funny. Actually, we left the guide in Havana, and on the way home my wife said she'd have to buy another once we got home; she had not finished the extensive and very good ""history"" section."
4,very good,"Very details information and the maps are very useful, the one of the best book this kind and you much read before go to the island."
2,Dance on my Grave - that's all that happens,"I wish my friend hadn't told me that this was a book made him cry his heart out. It made me expect a real tearjerker, some really heartbreaking material.Unfortunately not. Maybe it's because I couldn't relate to the character, who always tended to get himself into unrealistic Looney Tunes style fiascos, maybe it's because it should be for, as the book states, 'teenagers and young adults' (but I'm 22!), or maybe it's because there's lots of pontificating and not much else. There's not much of a story to this book, but if you like reading ""me and my thoughts"" books, then this is it. Personally, I need a book which keeps you more on edge.My friend liked it a lot though."
5,Courage is not a good enough word to describe this little boy's story,"This is an absolutely incredible book about the story of AIDs in South Africa. Never before has the AIDs crisis been made so real to the reader. The story is focused around hero Nkosi Johnson's short life and legacy. Jim Wooten did a wonderful job of conveying the emotion and struggle of this conflict which is the greatest enemy of Africa today. Whoever gave this book two stars for not saying Wooten got across the emotion, must not have a pulse. I highly recommend this book for your own good of exposure to the AIDs crisis. There is something for all of us to learn from this story."
2,We're All the Same but We Write Differently,"Too bad Jim Wooten couldn't get himself out of the story even tho he promised at the beginning to insert himself only where necessary. I felt like I was listening to a documentary vs. reading a memoir. He completely missed the emotional tone of the thing and instead, got lost for three pages on who the father was. He should stick to Tv or whatever he did before that made him famous."
5,We are all the same...,"Excellent book. I read it because I am going to South Africa, but this book is a good read for everyone. It is informative and compassionate with just the right amount of information to get a clear picture of the characters and how AIDS has impacted this country."
4,It's not only retro 'n' roll,"Once again, another eclectic album by the southamerican Fab Four ;). As in their two previous cd's (1998's Autopistas y Túneles and 2000's Mancha Registrada), Super Ratones keep experimenting british styled rock 'n' roll (and some detroit garage too) mixed with different regional styles from around the globe, this time with an eye (or an ear) in Eastern Europe. ""Polka Miseria"" and ""Dice"" sound like Emir Kusturica & The No Smoking Orchestra rocking at Ny's CBGB and ""Sube y baja"", ""Carne Picada"" and ""Pararme Solo"" keep contact with The Stooges and MC5. Also, there are some brit-like ballads, like ""Viajo para olvidar"",""A Quien?"" and ""Nunca me fui"", the closing track, that equals an union between 90's britpop and Jeff Lynne, from Electric Light Orchestra."
5,Disco Heaven,"DISCO HEAVEN is a great compilation filled with shiny disco songs with big vocals. This one is my favorite thus far in the series. There's a lot of great songs spread across 2 discs, 24 tracks in total. Some highlights include Inaya Day ""Hold Your Head Up High"", a cover of Michael Jackson's ""Man In The Mirror"" done by Rythme Fatal feat Redd-Angel, Michael Grey's ""The Weekend"", Solitaire's ""You Got The Love"", Soul Rebels ""I'll Be Good"", StoneBridge and Therese ""Take Me Away"", and many others. A worthwhile compilation to get your groove on with!"
2,"More Disco, Less Heaven","Disco Heaven 01.05 is the fourth title in the Disco Heaven series. It's a change of direction for the series in that it moves to a more disco heavy sound and away from the gospel-jazz-dance sound that made it's three predecessors ( Disco Heaven 01.04, 02.02, 02.03 ) such excellent albums. This change could be excused if the songs were unique or at least ""catchy"" but they're really just average disco songs. Disco Heaven 01.05 is a true disappointment compared to the first three albums."
2,Not What I Expected,"If you like repetition and an outdated Miami/San Fran rave club beat that never ends throughout the 2 disks then this cd is for you. It was not at all the type of mix of disco I anticipated but that may be my fault. There's no pulp fiction here, just a continuous boring repetitive dance beat on every track. You could just hit repeat on the 1st song and you'd get the same result..."
4,If you think language is a virus...,"If language has ever or stolen your dignity in Paris, or slapped a large strip of duck tape over your lips; or if you've ever learned anything from a 4 year-old...I highy recommend this novel. The allusions get a bit tedious, but what a wonderful transcendence above where language and literal description leave you scratching your head trying to figure out how to communicate an idea. It's fun."
1,An inert book.,"I wanted to like this book very much. But I found it quite boring and odd. Not that oddness is bad (I enjoy Pynchon immensely), but this particular kind is. It is frustrating, repetitive, and does not offer much in the way of style and language. For all it's erudition, and the originality of its concept, the book left the brassy taste of emptiness in my mouth when I was finished. Certainly not worth anyone's while who is not a student of philosophy, and hardly worth while for one who is."
2,This book recommonded to me is a book for literary wanna be.,"This book was recommended to me by a lawyer friend who thought it was brilliant. The book makes great claims on the book jacket, eg ""it is ""as precise and dazzling as Joyce."" Thats ridiculous! This is a quite shallow book for literary wanna bees! It has no depth. Literary allusions are sprinkled through it, but in a quite silly way with no integrity at all with respect to such plot as there is. The author will merely pick up the name of a great writer and make childish jokes: Joyce by comparison is brilliantly literate. Anyone who reads would be horrified by the comparison! The book is silly from beginning to end and hardly even at the level even of a parody. For that reason and a number of other reasons I got more and more annnoyed as I read it. Dizzy it is, but not delightful. Its claims to be experimental are also absurd. It is just vacuous."
5,a singularly elegant journey...,"there are numerous sensations we are unable to put into words. these are the reasons that i enjoy an intense conversation, sit on the beach, sip a cup of tea and perhaps most of all...pick up a book...wow...what a book...i am reminded of the solitude of beckett's ill seen, ill said; the relativism of pinget's recurrent memory; the textual exploration of robbe-grillet's topology of a phantom city; and so much more...so very much more...markson has allowed me to see the world and especially how i recall it in a remarkable new way...this the book i would take to a deserted island."
4,"Brilliant, funny and strange, picks up where samuel beckett left off","David Markson is sort of like a soft-core Samuel Beckett, the stacatto sentences that make up Wittgenstein's Mistress are a voice from the edge of experience, maybe not as extreme an edge as Beckett, but no less singular or powerful. Maybe she is the last person on earth. Maybe she's just crazy, maybe both. But her oddly funny musings on history, literature, music and painting develop this weird, enthralling rhythm, as does the incredible sense of loneliness and isolation that those musings seem meant to ward off. Markson bounces between her coldly academic tone and a more goofy, anarchic sensibility with ease. For some reason, as I was reading it, I kept imagining the voice of Helen Mirren speaking the words."
3,Why I didn't finish an interesting book...,"Synopsis: A female artist writes about her life as the last person on earth.Reasons why I stopped reading this book halfway through (and then skipped to the end.)1.Interesting ideas, which is essential for me as a reader, but the language style was tedious. Even an intentional tedium is still tedious.2. Male author speaking as a female. This often works, however the way the narrator speaks about her menstruation sounded like a man trying to sound like a woman and that ""willing suspension of disbelief"" got suspended right there.3. Also halfway, I realized the narrator sounded exactly like me and I spend enough time in my own head; I want some relief.4. It would have been nice if some resolution or growth occurred somewhere--I guess I'm a traditionalist after all."
2,cheap product,Our new xbox iglow controller broke within a week of purchase. The control knob dislodged from it's socket and it's useless. I would not recommend this product.
1,they're paperweights,"i received the controllers in good time which made me happy ... until i opened them package up . the first controller i tried didnt work at all , i think the receiver was the problem , but either way after many attempts i decided that it just wasnt going to happen , and went to the next one . the next one at least received a signal , which made me happy .... til i saw that the left stick was broken and leaning to the left , rendering it worthless as well. they look cool when they light up , but thats about all that worked on em . they're garbage."
2,iGlow Wireless,In less than two weeks both of the controllers broke and they can't be used. They were very lightly used. They are poor quality.
2,"Cool idea, terrible controllers.","I loved the idea of the glowing controllers. They look cool when lit up and work pretty nicely. Except for the fact that the joysticks break off of the metal part after about 3 months. It seems to be just a cheap plastic housing that connects the joystick to the actual metal piece that moves. I received them as a gift for christmas with my xbox. I loved them. The white one broke after about 3 months, and I thought I had just gotten a bad pair of them. I bought another package and they worked great. Until they both broke. Cool idea, complete waste of money. Too flimsy and the joysticks are barely held onto the controller."
1,Nostradamus Exposed,"Terrible. I'm not religiously motivated. The guy who narrated this definitely was. Bible this and bible that. We don't watch movies to listen to some [guy] talk about the bible. Nostradamus was a neat indidividual, but I can't even think of another Nostradamus movie after watching this."
1,the secrets of nostradamus exposed,This is a very deceptive video. It does not expose anything except the opinion of a religious man who tries to make you feel guilty about even reading about Nostradamus. He claims Nostradamus basically just copied from the Bible and got his visions from the occult. He contradicts every predition with his interpretation. Only at the end of the video do you get a true picture of the man narrating the video as nothing but a preacher and his true colors come out. He is very judgmental about Nostradamus as well as anyone who even wants to read about him. Very dissappointed with this video.
5,Rare vintage soul,"With some recording artist/song writers after an extended period of time the material produced can become predictable. Charles Brown has been on the recorded music scene as long as I can remember and ""Someone To Love"" illustrates the care that he has placed into his craft of writing great songs and along with this project his selection of musicians to complete what can only be described as a master working his gift. ""Merry Christmas Baby"" a standard by any critics measure, ""Someone To Love"" a collections of standards just a refreshing as the onset. Anyone interested in listning to good music will appreciate this effort."
5,"Not Drownng, Waving","My exploration of Virginia Woolf has been a progression from To the Lighthouse to Orlando to The Waves. The Waves is not the best of the three, but does seem to be the pinnacle of Woolf's technique. Like impressionist painters in the same time period, Woolf was trying to see what the limits of her medium were--what could be expressed with the written word that could not be expressed in any other way. Her amazing creativity with metaphor and blurred boundaries of time and mind are in full force here. In addition, the book has a poetic (yes, oceanic) rhythm that is unlike anything else written. Ultimately, it is not an easy read, but is nonetheless an entrancing experiment of literature as dream."
1,less expensive editions,"The one star rating refers not to Woolf's novel--which receives a five-star rating--but to this particular edition. There are less expensive editions of this novel. The ""annotations"" of this edition are not new--and the editor makes no secret that the annotations are available elsewhere. The ""introduction"" is interesting, but it also offers nothing particularly new for Woolf scholars and nothing particularly enlightening for non-academic readers that they could not easily find on any number of online sources."
1,This isn't the edition for your collection,"My review applies to the specific hardcover edition and not to the book itself. The Waves is brilliant. It is an essential book for anyone who loves the art of writing, and loves it especially for how it can alter our perspective on life.My reason for the one-star rating is the quality of the publication. This is not the edition that you want in your collection of best-loved books. It is copied, not printed, on poor paperstock, and in a cheap binding.... Basically an ugly edition. It does not come close to doing the book itself justice. And at the price charged, well, it's outrageous."
5,I love this tent!,"As a professional, I have to say this tent is awesome, and despite what the other review said, I believe it works well in cold weather as well as hot. The vents at the top (which are there so you don't suffocate in the snow) can easily be velcroed shut. This, combined with the fly keep out the wind nicely. True, the window in the fly is always open for anyone to look in, but it's pretty small. Don't camp with weirdos!I love the fact that the fly comes all the way to the ground, which is great in the rain, and allows me to keep my gear dry without it being inside the tent. It's easy and quick to put up...a little tough in the wind, but doable. because of it's low profile, shape of the fly, and tie-down anchors, it performs excellently in strong winds."
5,Kirk Douglas is a genius at playing this genius!!! What a movie!,"I will always love any work of van Gogh's because I feel I understand it better, somehow. It is thru the acting of Kirk Douglas, how he portrays the talent and tortured soul of this genius. 5 star for sure!!!"
3,Post-Impressionist Painting 101,"""Lust for Life"" and ""The Agony And The Ecstasy"" were two of the first artist films that I ever saw. Its taken a while to find them but I'm very happy to have them in my permanent collection.Along with ""Frida"", ""Pollock"", ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"" (Vermeer), ""Goya's Ghost"", ""Carrington"", ""Camille Claudel"" (Claudel and Rodin), ""Georgia O'keeffe"", ""Superstar"" (Warhol) and ""Crumb"". ""Lust for Life"" is mainly about Vincent Van Gogh and Paul Gauguin's friendship and collaberation, while ""The Agony And The Ecstasy"" delves into Michelangelo and Pope Julius II's rocky patronage.These films may not be completely historically accurate but they are all artistically done, Oscar caliber and catnip for the serious fine arts lover."
4,If you want to meet Vincent Van Gogh...,"Forget about the fact that it was made in the 50's, the quality was restored and the directing is cartoonish; the story is rich, the artist was on an emotional rollercoaster, you get to see a lot of his work (well, some of them are actually reproductions of the paintings in the making) and the it's starring Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn, need I say more? Buy the DVD now!"
3,Price Increase,I put this DVD on my wish list and the vender promptly raised the price by 14%. The same product is available by another vendor for less that the the original price. It always pays to check prices from different vendors.
3,"Great film, disappointing DVD","Warner Home video offers a good colorful transfer of LUST FOR LIFE, one of Vincente Minnelli's and Kirk Douglas' best films. However, the print used for transfer should have been restored. Even more disturbing is the lack of DVD extras. Other than a very good, though dry,commentary track and a trailer, there are no extras for this important film. Not even the ""making of"" featurette prepared at time of the film's release. Very surprising considering the care that Warner HV normally puts into its releases. The moive is a must, however this DVD presentation disappoints. Certainly worth a rental or purchased at a ""used"" price. Perhaps one day WHV will revist with a truly special edition."
3,Nonplussed for Life,"People jumping around like monkeys. Tall dignified monkeys, or lowly grimy monkeys, but monkeys none the less. Melodramatic, affected monkeys bopping around papery, evenly lit sets, with occasional exterior establishing shots. Stage acting? Silent film acting? Who cares. The activity of a scene ends and suddenly the lighting jumps 3 shades brighter, because they have inserted another film layer for a slowly cross-fading transition to the next scene. Yes, its one of those.Its unfair to judge this movie by today's standards, and unfair to this review not to.--Did Van Gogh cut off his own ear?--Did he mail it to anyone?--Was it all over a man or a woman?Anyway, after the ""accident"" I found the decision to simply shoot Douglas from his right for the rest of the picture rather than create some kind of make-up special effect for his ear, a rather tasteful one.If you are curious about Van Gogh, but not curious enough to read ""Lust for Life"" then watch it."
1,"Lust for Life, Indeed!","Douglas as Van Gogh was a reincarnation of the artist himself. Van Gogh was an eccentric and tormented soul. Douglas manifested all the elements needed to descibe and fullfill the artist's message. Like all the great artists, Modiliani, Gauguin and Van Gogh were haunted by the demons of their past, which inevitably lead to their self destruction. An excellent film to all, not just art historians."
2,Re: no subj.,"Product was a flimsy material to begin with and lousy craftmanship. It makes people think and THEN buy more durable products which are sold in the U.S.A. Buy AMERICAN and you can't go wrong, more expensive but You pay for solid quality. Besides, it doesn't fit!"
2,not that great,"Its ok, it doesn't really fit me very well. It comes in handy every once in a while, but i don't use it much anymore."
3,*Important*,"As for M. Monson who claimed that the first song was the greatest rock song they have heard in ten years...well they must have been locked in a cellar for ten years and chained to the wall. For the most part this cd is just average rock. The pic on the front is kinda what you what expect from an aggressive guitar-driven rock band. BUT, this is nothing of the sort. I'm slightly dissapointed cause I was expecting some hard angst rock but instead got, well, Candlebox part 2. (Except at least Candlebox had catchy songs like Far Behind) This is rock/mellow rock so don't be fooled by the reviews claiming this is hard. Finally, and I'm not saying this is always true cause there have been many exceptions, but when you buy a record from a group that isn't signed to a major label, (in this case the label is DMI..doesn't ring a bell, does it?) then you're bound to get an at best average cd that knows nothing of the word ""catchy."""
5,This book will get you thinking...,"Elliott's book is a good read for those who have ever worried about America's growing obsession with medicine and technology. Even if you haven't ever wondered or thought about this part of American life, read the book anyway, because you should probably start. Elliott brings in a little of everything: the past, present and future, and scientific data as well as personal opinion, in order to ask the question, 'So where are we going with all this?' I think that this book can start a lot of us out on the right foot in trying to answer that question..."
2,"Starts Out Great, But...","I got this book based on his April 2006 Atlantic Monthly article. Turns out that he spends nearly the first two chapters with a focus on patients who have undergone sex change operations. Lots of useful information and insights...but he does overanalyze ""identity."" I realized that he doesn't quite ""get it"" when he asserted that we teach our children to fake gratitude and appreciation to others."
1,omg so ugly,"I specifically ordered this plant because it looks so realistic in the photo, I open the package and it's pearly and bright green, one color, just horrible. Going straight in the trash."
4,Great CD by Allen & Allen,"This is an excellent cd. Has classic gospel songs with a very cool jazz flavor to them. Love A & A. Next to Ben Tankard and Sam Levine, I enjoy listening to these three artists the most. Very uplifting."
5,Disnery Encyclopedia of Baby and Childcare,"This is a MUST HAVE REFERENCE for parents, babysitters, daycare people, etc. Is organized by developmental age, newborn, 2-3 months old, etc. You can use the index to look up a diagnosis or body sytem (respiratory sys.) or look up the conditions alphabetically. The colored pictures are great...especially for a child choking or needing mouth to mouth resusitation. I will never sell this book. It will stay in the family."
3,Gothic mystery spelling,"This is a fun 1947 guilty pleasure gothic mystery romance, complete with deranged villain and golden haired damsel. Set in the 1840s among the Hudson Valley Dutch ""aristocracy"", it is, due to the pathetic quality of the proof reading, sometimes impossible to tell if the words are Dutch or just another aberration of the text recognition program used to create the Kindle version. There has very obviously been no actual proof reading.......the word ""the"" is rendered as ""die"" throughout."""
2,Melodrama and more melodrama,"I've long loved Seton's other books, particularly Katherine, The Winthrop Woman, Avalon, and even Green Darkness. I suppose I missed reading this one long ago, and I wanted to like it as well. I just can't. Perhaps I no longer love the Gothic romances, but I doubt that. I can even understand the peculiar nature of the relationship between the heroine and her husband, but it is on the whole, overly simplistic and I was annoyed most of the time with waiting interminably for the inevitable conclusions. Read her other books and skip this one. I now go to reread Katherine and let Seton redeem herself."
4,One of Seton's best,"This book turned me into an Anya Seton fan when I was about ten years old. When I later studied New York State history in school, I knew more about the rent wars than the teacher -- thanks to this book. It inspired a lifetime love of history and of Anya's delicious way of delivering it. I went on to read ""Katherine"", ""The Winthrop Woman"" (about an ancestress of mine), ""Green Darkness,"" and others.This one was/is my favorite. I'd love to see the Vincent Price movie once more."
5,"gripping, spooky and romantic","I have other Anya Seton's books - I found this to be very different from Katherine or The Winthrop Woman, but just as enjoyable. I read it until 2am and had to get up at 7am, but I just couldnt put it down. A romantic period story which is not your typical 'bodice ripper'and is well founded in historical details."
5,Really enjoyable read,I can't believe that I've ignored Anya Seton for all of these years. I thought this would be a simple gothic romance novel/ghost story and it was so much more. I loved Anya's eye for historic details and her insights into human motivation that are still pertinent to this day. I highly recommend this book and look forward to reading the rest of her novels.
3,Not one of Seton's finest,"This is a mediocre work. Seton's ""Katherine"" is far superior. The actions of ""Nicholas"" in this work are so far fetched and confusing they severely affected my enjoyment of the novel."
2,Even the author made fun of this book ...,"When the book opens, our young heroine is reading a tawdry rag of a novel ... consider it foreshadowing of your own experience and go no further. This book was a depressing and sophomoric bore."
2,Junior High Reading,"I didn't like this book. I gave it two stars only because of some of the descriptive narrative -- This is a book I would have liked to have read in Junior High, it was slow and predictable.Mirinda Wells, born to poor farmers, goes to live with rich relations and beomes a woman. I highly recommend it for Junior/Senior High children. I was disappointed and wished I hadn't wasted my time trying to 'get into' this book, it never happened."
1,uh-oh,I feel like a traitor since I love Seton's THE GREEN DARKNESS but this is probably the worst book I have read in ages. The characters are amoral and unsympathetic and nothing really happens. Blech--I want the two hours I wasted on this back.
3,Gold,This book is mostly information that is already on the web or in other publications.It has some good information in it though.
1,Return of Watch Repair Tool Kit,"Deluxe Watch Repair Tool Kit for Minor Repairs in Zipper CaseReturned Tool Kit due to strong mildew odor inside case and I couldn't get rid of the smell. I was supposed to make an exchange for a Watch Storage Case, which cost 13.00 more and they were going to waive the shipping because of the problem that caused the return. However, that didn't happen and I was disappointed. I must have checked the wrong box on return sheet. Did get credit back on my account, minus the shipping charge which I had paid for the return. Otherwise, I got prompt answers on my e-mail requests and would do business with this Company again. Storage Case is very beautiful and worth the money as far as I am concerned. Will order another one soon. Marjory Lowrie"
1,cheap,the jewel screwdrivers blades broke .could not remove the screws that i needed to remove..would not recomend.
1,Cheaply made.,This product is not worth the money. I used it twice and both times ended up with broken or bent tools. First time I used the tweezers they bent. Following that the pin removal tool's tip snapped off.
2,disappointing,"Quality is poor. I was able to change the hands on a Unitas watch using them, but I can see that I will not be able to use the tools on a long term basis. And ideally there should have been a guide booklet or something that indicates what some of these tools are for."
4,Good Review,I like this kit. I have replaced batteries & sized bands for both sides of my family. I only broke one tool forcing the back off of my 15th watch.
3,"Cheap, but you get what you pay for.","First of all, I know nothing about watch repair. I had to research stuff on the internet so I could figure out how to do it and what equipment I needed. The Paylak kit (Made in India) looked pretty complete. It had everything it said it would come with. However, on closer examination, some stuff like the watch case holder (round thingy that you put the watch on while you are messing with it) was not what the pictures said it would look like - what I got was some cheesy cheap looking naugahyde covered disk which did the job of stabilizing the watch case, but just barely. The plastic nonmagnetic tweezers (for changing out watch batteries) were not well machined and kept slipping. Eventually, I got the job done, but not without wishing for slightly better quality tools. Having some instructions as to how to use each tool properly would have been a big help."
2,Instructions please,The instructions that you do get are wrong. The items I get and the ones listed are totally different. It doesn't tell you how to use each of the tools. Some of the tools I'm still puzzled in what to do with it. The soft head hammer that is used to knock the pin back into bracelet doesn't look too soft too me!
1,Jaxa wrench does not come with the bits that go in the three holes.,"... which makes the wrench completely useless. I'll have to buy another wrench elsewhere from a vendor that supplies the bits. Also, the wooden handles have splinters and are extremely cheaply made. Do not buy this product."
5,It's The 2nd Dr. Martens Shoe I Own!,This boot is very comfortable and light weight compared to my wife's more expensive Dr. Martens boot. I was very surprised at how light it weighted. It did take like a 1.5 week to wear out the leather to make it soft and comfortable. Before the wear time it did hurt my left toe's Proximal Phalanges bone area [...]It is very well built too so it would last for years like my first Dr. Martens shoe I got.
4,Sturdy soles,"Pros: Good soles, very comfortable (almost no breaking-in required)Cons: the leather seems too soft such that creases form quite easily."
5,dr.martins,I ordered these as a christmas present for my son. They were the perfect fit and they are his second pair he loves the boots
2,Overpriced here - buy new on Arica website for $25 - or not...,"DEFINITELY do not buy ""new"" here as it is much cheaper via the Arica website. However I concur that the material is radically out of date. Its sole usefulness is following the trail of what Oscar USED to think about realms, instincts, etc. You can borrow it from any decent public library system, read it and note the points you care about, which are anyway buried pretty deeply in a text that was clearly taken straight from the lectures and NOT edited for readability.The presentation style and word usage are extremely dated so be prepared to wince a lot."
5,awesome,"Daryl Coley is an annoited and awesome minister of the gospel and of song. He touches the heart, soul and spirit of everyone who hears his wonderful music."
2,Old Music Book,"Condition of book was not very good, but music is still able to be read. Nice easy Xmas music for young learners."
2,Better than nothing,"As the old saying goes ""Jack of all trades - Master of none"". This manual tries to cover five different GM models and as a result does none of them well. While attempting to diagnose a fuel feed problem in my 1994 Grand Am I found several errors in the documentation. The manual will cover one type of system in a particular year group and gives you the infamous... other models similar. So, while it's better than stumbling around in the dark I can't recommend spending $22 for it."
4,Comprehensive Study Guide,"If you need the information to study for the MySQL dev and dba exams, this is the book. It covers most everything, but it is more of a manual than a book covering the subject. So although it covers all the material (and then some), it isn't a comfy read."
4,great prep for exam,"I took the MYSQL 5.0 dev I and Dev II exams from this book.More than any other book I've ever read, this book prepares you for the exam. There's no material on the test that is not in the book, another first. In fact, some of the examples on joins and subqueries are taken straight out of the book's questions on CD's; some of the tables used in the exam are taken straight out of the book's examples. I can't stress this enough: more than any other Cisco, MS, Red Hat, Sun, or CISSP book, what is on the exam is in the book if you are willing to read carefully.The questions are challenging, even more so than the exam itself. The writing is clear, as good as any book I've read. The examples are all excellent.4 stars instead of 5 because the authors can't resist putting their political views in the text. They prominently list ""Palestine"" as a country (unnecessarily IMO) and refuse to say ""fire triggers"" because of the association with guns.Besides that, it's a great book."
4,Learning MySql,"If you need to learn MySql, this book is a very good choise, easy to understand, good and clear examples step by step, no just the query they show the query and the response from the server, not like another books that only show the query but don't show you the server response, you must guest or try and try."
5,Solid material for exam or not,This book is a very comprehensive guide to what MySQL offers and can teach you.Would definitely recommend for anyone needing a great book about MySQL.
4,"Pen is ok, BUT...","The pen seems to work fine, although I haven't had it long.However, check your total carefully before confirming you order: at least one vendor charges only a couple of dollars for the pen but adds $20.00 shipping charge (for a shipping weight of only 5 or 6 ounces). Vendors that charge a buck or so more for the pen charge only a fraction of that amount for shipping."
4,"Yep, it draws black lines on CD/DVD discs.","Bought them so as to avoid destroying CDs and DVDs I write on. Other permanent markers are said to be bad for the long-term health of the discs, and these pens are said to not cause the discs to deteriorate. But, we don't have decades to wait around to find out if it is true or not, so all I can say is that they write OK on the discs. Not quite as smoothly or as well as, say, a Sharpie, but 90% as well. Works for me. I've had them a month and they work."
2,NOT fine point,"I owned an ""eFilm Solvent-Free CD/DVD Pen"" previously, which was ""fine point"" and much easier to write legibly on optical media. The point on this pen is too fat."
1,They dried out very fast,These pens only lasted about 6 to 9 months. And then they were dry completely. I stored them at room temperature. what else was I supposed to do?
2,Not a fine enough point,"This was to replace an old CD pen that was almost out of ink, which had a fine enough point to write small. In contrast, this archival gold pen has too fat of a tip. Looks and writes like a Sharpie."
1,They just don't work,"Archival Gold products were a huge disappointment, these markers just beaded up and smeared. Also, I bought their CDs and DVDs. CDs were fair. DVDs had to be mostly thrown out."
1,Dried Out,One of the pens was used immediately upon receipt but was only good for a few DVDs before drying up. The other pen never worked. In retrospect; I should have returned them.
3,Not that impressed,"This was probably a much better book back in its day. One of the problems with a lot of older stories is they're one-trick ponies. There's a single plot line and that's it. Over time readers have demanded more and more intricate and complex plots and subplots, and books that don't rise to that challenge seem dull in comparison. I think that's why it took so long for me to read Bug Jack Barron. You have Howards the rich evil guy trying to pull one over on America, and you have Barron the media celebrity with a direct line to the public standing in his way; and that's the whole of conflict in the entire story.So while an interesting read as far as seeing the ideas Spinrad had and the world he's created, unless you're going to pick this up just to check another off your 'classics' list, go with something fresher."
4,"Good but,...","Not what I consider science fiction. For me, classic sci fi is big space, etc. But Norman Spinrad is a great writer and the book was enjoyable."
1,An old book that doesn't wear well,"I read this book -- and was somewhat impressed -- when I was a kid, but rereading it today it seems like a book written mostly to impress adolescents of the 1970s. The female characters are poorly drawn, the hip lingo is *really* out-dated, and the conundrum faced by the protagonist fails to grab today's adult readers. Even the profanity is boring."
4,Yummy,"This collection of stories was an amazing celebration of womanhood, including stories of love, life, and tragedy. This compilation covers all the bases of a woman's life from poverty and love in the heart-wrenching story ""Christmas in the Silver Egg"" to the humorous ""I'll Never Understand my Wife,"" which deals with marriage. A Second Chicken Soup for the Woman's Soul is satisfying, refreshing, and warmhearted."
2,"Nothing but cliches, but still a so-so read","As the title says, this book is filled with cliches. From an unlikely boy hero to an unlikely familiar (a Skunk!) to Wizards taking apprentices like Blacksmiths, etc.Its just all too familiar.I will admit that I did not finish this book (it was too horrible) but what I did read was so-so.The actual writing style of the author is great, but the plot stinks and the ideas are unoriginal. If you've read Jordan, Stanek, Goodkind, Tolkien, Brooks, etc, then I might recommend this book. But I would say only people that read every fantasy book on the market should read it."
4,Great for the vehicle or boat,"As the title says, this is great for the car or a boat, even in a barn or stable. This was given to me as a present, and, if you know me, you know why!! Amazingly, I have yet to use it. The metal box is great, I have already stepped on it, dropped it in a parking lot and it tumbled out of the car and plopped into a good puddle, yet the contents were safe. Almost everything you will need is in the metal container. The only addition I wll be making is an ace bandage, probably the single sticky version, but I think there should be an ace bandage in every first aid kit. If you have a van or truck, it is able to be mounted inside of the vehicle, but the case fits just fine in the hatch of my PT (along with ALL sorts of other stuff). So, 4 stars because it is what they say, minus one only because, from my past experiences I feel you should have an ace bandage in every first aid kit."
3,Oops,I rated to wrong one. This kit is Ok but has a lot of stuff almost never needed and not enough of stuff needed most. First thing I needed was tweezers. One plastic tweezer in a bag that says to throw away after one use.
2,The Incredible Egg -- not about a boy's dinosaur,This is actually a comment about the one review available for this book. The Incredible Egg: A Billion Year Journey is NOT the same book that the other reviewer writes about. The book she is writing about is a great book. This book is an actual history of the egg! I'm still looking for the children's book about a boy and his dinorsaur egg.
4,Bonus Tracks,"Only 2 years old when Paper Lace repeated their UK success with a Number 1 single in the colonies, I have quite a different perspective on this CD reissue. KUDOS to the producers, who have finally made the B-side of 'The Night Chicago Died', a seemingly-Beatles/Badfinger inspired track called 'Can You Get It When You Want It?' available to those of you who didn't swipe your older sister's copy of the 45. Omitted from the LP release in 1974, It's about time it was available again. I was 10 years old before I realized that 'Can You Get It' wasn't the A-side. Along with the other tracks (the Superior original of 'Billy, Don't Be A Hero' to name but one), this collection is a must for Retro Brit-Pop fans!"
4,"Kitschy, Camp, and Totally Dear","I vaguely remember hearing a couple of the songs on this album when I was a very small girl, but wasn't completely familiar with Paper Lace until a friend drew my attention to them recently. Listening to this CD is like being taken in a time capsule back to 1973: a time when HR Pufnstuf rocked my socks, a time where I wore my kneehigh rainboots around the house because I wanted Go-Go Boots so badly, a time when wax lips and candy cigarettes still cost under ten cents. This album represents a more innocent time in some ways, a more daring one in others. If you, too, want to be transported back in time this way, then do yourself a favor and get this CD."
2,Color is not red,"When I recieved this item I was very disappointed, the halter color was not red. It is more of a coral orange. Very disappointing, but the quality is decent."
3,Rutger deserves better scripts,This is a watchable movies---especially for Rutger Hauer fans. He plays bad guys so convincingly. The other cast members were good but the script is typical Hollywood nonsense.
3,Entertaining though not outstanding,"The story moves forward well enough and has an element of suspense. The caliber of the acting is satisfactory plus, and the improbability and contrived sequence of events exert limits on the overall effect. Does not improve on, nor much vary, previous videos of this genre."
1,disappointing amazon return service,"In a nutshell - bought this item in late Oct. for an Xmass gift. (I like to get my shopping done early.)Christmas day my mother went to try it out. Product was defective - sealer would not seal, which made the unit useless.Due to Amazon's return policy - item was ordered more than 30 days ago, I was only able to get a partial refund - not even a replacement for the defective item. Needless to say, I will no longer buy Xmass gifts from Amazon - at least those that are of the electronic nature. BUYER BEWARE!!!"
5,Great Machine!,"This is probably the best food sealer on the market today. I think I probably had one of the 1st Seal-a-Meal's made in the 1970's, and although I love it, this one is 100 time better. The only slight drawback is that it requires quite a bit of pressure to snap it closed, and then a lot to open it again. Other than that, it does a great job of sucking all the air out of the bag, and sealing it tight. I can store many more Seal-a-Meal bags in the freezer than I can freezing the same food in containers."
2,Diffucult,"I received it for Christmas. It is very difficult to use. I couldn't get the supplied bags to seal properly after two tries. It is supposed to snap shut, but my wife wasn't able to put enough pressure on it and I also found it hard to close. And it was also hard to reopen."
1,Do not waste your time with this product,"I bought one of these about a year ago. When I brought it home it sealed 2 bags then stopped working. I called the company and they said to take it back to the store. I assumed it was just an extreme case so I exchanged it for the same product. Within the first year of having it, the wire that seals the bags has burned through it's protective coating. So now whenever I seal a bag it burns a hole in it, which then lets air into the bag, defeating the whole purpose of the machine. I wrote the company and asked if there was something I could do or a part I could buy, I was told that they don't sell that part and that since it had been a year there was nothing they could do. I do not recommend this product, it's cheap and the Rival customer service is definitely lacking!"
2,"Seal a Meal, good design with no factory support and parts.","I bought this product a couple of years ago and was initially very impressed. After a while I had problems with the heater strip. I disassembled the heater ad thought ""This isn't so bad, I can fix this easily."" That is until I discovered that there are no parts available from the maker and no after market availability either.It would be a very easy appliance to repair. If parts were available and at a reasonable price I would give a 4 star rating. (I rarely give 5 stars as I'm very technically competent and there are few products that deserve that high a rating.)"
1,Hard to close plastic cover eventally cracks,"My cover is cracking on the corners from closing even though the manual states: ""Do not be afraid to apply pressure to the Lid, you will not damage the sealer."" (What a JOKE!)Even their new models have the same ""push down hard to close"" cover!I wote to Rival and they don't care or stand behind their products. They only guarantee it to hold together for one year, make sure you keep your receipt or your on your own. I would recommend finding another brand."
4,Good value,"While this machine may not be the easiest to get started with the vaccuuming -- the directions are not clear that the machine needs to be (forced) closed before the suction will activate [and although it's only sensible that the machine be closed, a lot of pressure needs to be exerted, so it's easy to think you may break it] -- it works well for the cost. The bags are pre-cut or you can select any size you want from the roll that accompanies the unit -- and they are reusable, which make for additional savings as well. I have had no problems with the sealing apparatus. In fact, once the vaccuuming begins, the product works very well. Considering many other units are sold for double the price of this one, I think this is a good overall value."
1,Shipping cost you incur for then to fix their problem.,The Rival VS110 Seal-a-Meal worked great on the first few bags.Then the bag developed a hole in the center of each seal allowing air back into the bag. Unfortuately this happened after 45 days from the purchase date. Therefore we had to ship it back to Rival Products at our expense.(shipping cost to them and back to us)They said they had received complants about this problem. So don't buy a Rival product and have to pay the shipping cost for them to fix their problem.
1,Don't buy this low-grade marzipan,"I ordered this marzipan last Christmas, amazed by the great deal that I had found.Unfortunately, the old addage is true: you get what you pay for.This marzipan is made with corn syrup instead of sugar, so it doesn't have the same texture.Even more interesting is that I froze the unused marzipan in the same bag with a 'better' variety. Within three months this marzipan had taken on a freezer taste, whereas the higher grade marzipan still tastes great even one year later. They were both in the same bag together, so it can only be the ingredients themselves that didn't hold up.This may be fine for gourmands, but a more refined palate is going to recognize the difference right away. I am so glad that I didn't buy the ten pound block like I originally intended. It may be suitable where the marzipan doesn't take center stage, but when the marzipan flavor is important pay the extra money for a 60+% almond paste made with sugar."
1,WARNING OUTRAGEOUS SHIPPING COST!!!,"Buyers Beware, 1 lb. of Marzipan for $4.99.. Sounds great, right?What they neglect to tell you is that there is an additional $9 shipping charge!!!!!!Insane.If this company *ever* thinks they will get another dime from me, they are sorely mistaken.I placed my order along with some books, and Amazon does not itemize the shipping charges, only gives you one lump sum for all the items you order... At *no point* does Amazon or the company tell you what the shipping is for this item, unless it is the only item you order, and then only right before the final checkout.It was only after paying, when I received itemized email invoices that I was informed of the $9 shipping charge.What an incredibly shortsighted business practice.1 lb Marzipan, for $16. No thank you."
3,Biermann Marzipan 1 lb,"First of all, the picture shown is not what's received. It came in a round plastic container, not in a wedge shape. That doesn't matter much though.What does matter is this marzipan was so-so; I've found some brands of marzipan can be amazing, terrible, and so-so. This one is so-so. Also, I thought I was buying unflavored, plain almond paste marzipan, but it turned out it was flavored with apricot kernels- which sounds delicious, but practically it only came out okay.The marzipan I get at my local European Deli smokes this one by miles and miles, but is much more expensive. I'm going to try a different brand on Amazon."
1,Corn Syrup,"Unfortunately the marzipan has corn syrup in it, so I couldn't use it. The corn syrup makes it sickly sweet. Too bad!"
5,Great service!,I gave this book as a gift. the person I got it for was very happy. The service was outstanding! My order was shipped the following day.
1,This book is NOT for kids,"This book is written for grown-ups, not for kids. A relative read this book to my children because she found it so funny but my 6-year-old told me later that the book made her feel ""sad"" and that the ""mommy didn't like her kids."" The story is about the mom being annoyed by her kids who were trying to share their accomplishments her. Their efforts were ill-timed on her part and she shows no tolerance for such. In fact she seems to show contempt for their efforts to connect with her. There are much better ways to address a parent's need for time away from their children. From a child's perspective, this book is just not right. I would not recommend reading this book to kids."
5,"Love this book, as do my children!","Such a cute book, great way to explain how a mom needs a break sometime too! We really needed this!"
1,Very Sweet Book,This book will make any parent laugh. Mrs. Large is a lovable and relatable character and kids love this book because of the imagery of the animals in the bath.
1,Mean book,"I thought this book was going to be funny and then at the end have the realization that it's nice to be around the kids, but it didn't do that. I was going to give it as part of a gift of a bunch of books, but when I read the whole thing I decided not to. Pass on this one."
5,Great,Another great Jill Murphy book with the elephant Mrs Large and her family! A perfect read for toddlers and young children.
2,"Not helpful, incomplete","The Onions Glossary is incomplete and out of date. For real help on the words in Shakespeare, the Lexicon or ""Shakespeare's Words"" (by the Crystals) is far, far superior."
1,One of the worst games I've ever played,"This has got to be the worst military game I've ever played. The best part of the game is before you even get into the game itself. The still photos of Rangers in action are the only positive thing I can say about it. Don't let it's low cost attract you, you get what you pay for. Save your money and buy Rainbow Six:Rogue Spear."
5,Another incredible 2006 Black Metal effort,"2006 has been a great year for Black Metal. Incredible (and accessible) CDs from Venom, Cradel of Filth, Dissection (RIP Jon), Satyricon, Carpathian Forrest, Celtic Frost, Enslaved, and now I. This offshoot from the ashes of Immortal more recalls Moterhead with more ""guteral"" vocals, plus a creativity usually not associated with this sub genre (at least not till this year). Those who enjoyed the Dimmu Borger side project Chrome Division should deffenatly seak out ""Between Two Worlds""."
3,Nothing special Abbath solo project,"Not bad but comming from Abbath I expected more. Most of the songs are mid-tempo Motorhead/Bathory (especially in the vocals) influenced metal. I was hoping for more of that dark Immortal sound as their last album Sons Of Northern Darkness was so excellent. There are hints of that power, some of these songs sound like a logical progression from SOND but overall they just don't have that extra something, that chills up the spine darkness. The guitar melodies are a little too happy and the vocals are sometimes weak, especially when Abbath tries to growl melodically. Between Two Worlds doesn't hit the emotional peaks or excitement of Abbath's previous work and seems unispired comparitively. Oh well I guess I'll have to wait for Immortal's reformation to get my fix."
4,works like a charm,"easy to install. i used this in combination with a quality patch panel from monoprice to create a data ""closet"" for my home. with the new panel, this hub, and some removeable keystone jacks, I can easily switch outlets over from telephone to wired internet as our needs change."
4,It's a good product line,Used this product line and have never had any problems/issues with them. I would use them again and once more and another time too. (is that 20 words?)
2,Very cheaply made,I wasn't expecting too much from such an inexpensive headset but these should only sell for about $10. Very cheaply made. I returned mine. The stock headset is much better.
2,Sounded pretty good until the left side stopped working,The price has dropped quite a bit since I bought this. I liked it for the built in mic and iPod pause/advance button (it functioned just like the set Apple gives you). The ear pieces were comfortable but mine just stopped working. There is a loose connection in the mic/pause button.
2,Broken headset in less than 1 week!,"I got the headset in reasonable timing but after 3 to 4 days of use, the jack and the cable connection are not well made as they became problem for me when I touched the cable and jack, the audio from my iPhone disappeared. I just sent it back to Rivet for a replacement and hopefully they will replace it as Blue Proton won't take back the broken headset...."
2,"Terrible sound, poor design","I only paid $17 for these headphones here through Amazon, but I still feel ripped off. The sound quality is very poor, no matter what equalizer setting on the iPhone you use (despite other reviewer claims). As far as sound quality goes, they couldn't be too much worse... so if you are buying them to improve on the already weak iPhone headphones, you will definitely be disappointed.The cloth covering for the cord is nice, and the sliding lanyard adjustment is a nice innovation as well. The problem is that unless you are running the cord down the back of your neck and then around front, the microphone that is built into the cord won't be ANYWHERE near your mouth. I am 6'5"" and when wearing these normally, the microphone is literally at the level of my belly button. Not really optimal placement for something so key to the whole function.These are definitely not the answer to the sad lack of decent iPhone headphones."
1,Horrible Product,"They broke after a week of usage. Very uncomfortable. It is indicated that you can use them either behind the neck or upfront. Both schemes are difficult to work with, simply because of the weight of the unit."
3,was this the only lanyard earphones made for the iPhone?,"The lanyard concept is awesome for iPhone/iPod/i-whatever, keeps my earbuds from falling all the way down when they fall out or I need to have them out for a while. The don't hold up forever, I bought spares and toss a set every several or so months. Does anyone else make durable lanyard earphones? The newer iPhones have a normal plug so I don't need ones specifically for the iPhone. But I don't want to pay $150 per set b/c they take some abuse and I doubt they'll last for years anyway. These were like $50-60 if I recall, that's a good price point for a cable you wear, and wear out."
2,"Decent earphone for $20, no way for $60","So I've gone through 3 sets of these. First set cost me $10, second set cost me $20, third set $35. Each set I had has broken such that:a. one earbud no longer worksb. mic button no longer worksc. cord snaps off at buttonI'd be willing to continue to get this at the original price, 'cause I like the way they fit and the lanyard design is very convenient, but $60 is way outrageous for a product that is just ok."
1,Broke after a couple of months,"I really liked these headphones before they broke. They fit well, the sound was fine by me, and I like the lanyard design. But eventually they broke, now the sound cuts out at the slightest movement of the wire, rendering them useless."
2,I loved these 20 buckers while they worked!,"I really love these earbuds but they are already broken!I've been using them daily for a month and really love them. They sound is as good as a pair of $20 earbuds can.However, the connector has already started shorting out. Too bad - I like these way better than the iPhone earphones.I'm very rough on earbuds but most brands last me 6 months before they get to the state these are in.Still, I may buy another set since there are no other inexpensive options yet."
2,Two broken in one month,"The Rivet Stereo Headset has okay voice quality for phone conversations, but poor music quality. The build is so fragile that extra care has to be applied to let them last longer than one month.The first one I bought broke in two weeks, when the microphone and the microphone button stopped working. I used this headset in regular computer headphone jack and destroyed the microphone circuit probably in 3 hours. So be very careful not to use it anywhere except for the iphone.the second one I bought broke within one week, when the extremely long wire caught up on a door handle and a moderate jerk broke the internal wire: the left headphone, the microphone and the button are all not responsive now.I would not recommend this headset, because unless extra care is applied, it will cost $20 a month to replace it every month."
2,"Rush engineering, cheap sound, bad mic.","Mine does have the button, but the mic/button is more than 2 feet from the earphone. This means the mic is right around my belt buckle. Do you talk out of your belly button? Cause I don't.Sound is blah, about the same as the apple earbuds."
5,Great headphones for an even better price!,"I'm not sure what others are seeing that is negative with these phones, but I've had them since summer 2007, and they've been rocking ever since!I've had a lot of more expensive headphones, but these have (to me) the same or better audio quality and I find them with better utility due to the neck lanyard system.I used to run with these babies and I also play drums along with my iPhone, and I've had nothing but great use and no problematic issues.Two thumbs/Five stars!!"
2,"Ok sounds, convenient design, but no durability","First of all, I am no audiophile. However, I thought it was pretty evident that the original apple headphones had far superior sound. I quickly got used to the landyard style, even though it can be a pain always having to stick your head through the loop. My first set quit working after a week, then the replacement set lasted slightly longer. I was pretty gentle with these- they were not durable at all. I'm curious to see how many people gave it good reviews for the sets to quit working soon after."
2,"Nice fit, but poor sound quality","The lanyard style works well, length of the cords is great, but the sound quality is not nearly as clean and crisp as the default iPhone headphones."
3,OK for the price,"I bought this headset for around $10. For that price I must admit that they are decent. I would have felt cheated if I had bought them when they were $30+ though. Bass is very muddy, mids and highs are ok. Noise isolation isn't very good and noise from the lanyard/cord is quite annoying unless sitting very still. Results are a little better when used as a phone headset. Callers don't complain about not being able to hear me, and I hear them well.These quickly became my secondary headset as I was gifted the V-Moda Vibe Duos recently. They are on the pricy side, but I highly recommend them if you can swing the $100 price tag. I'd have waited to buy them myself if the Rivets hadn't been so cheap. (and if I didn't get them as a gift!)"
1,Great for a month... exactly...,"This is a great product... for exactly a month. i read the reviews that said that it would break and one of the ear buds would not work anymore. i figured that i am extreamly careful with all of my stuff, and this would not happen to me... wrong!!i have had two sets of these and both of them broke just about a month after having them. both left ear buds just stopped working.They sounded great b4 that... but who wants something with a major flaw?dont waste your money... you worked hard for it."
1,Works for about a month and then breaks down,"I have had 2 sets of these headphones and bought another one for a friend. All three of them have worked between 1-2 months and then the left earbud dies out completely and the right one works sporadically. The mic continues to work but it is not always responsive for skipping a song or answering a call.Initially, I thought I was doing something wrong but if all three ended up the same way, it appears likely that these headphones are just not made very well.Also, I have attempted to contact Rivet to request warranty replacement and my requests have thus far been completely ignored.Ultimately, these headphones are a waste of money and I recommend trying out a different pair."
2,Not worth the money,"I've been looking for iPhone-compatible earphones for a while, since the included Apple earphones keep falling out (must be something odd about my ears). I didn't want to give up the microphone and the v-moda duo (with mic) are backordered, so I figured if these were originally $30-$40, I'd give them a try. Unfortunately, the sound quality is nowhere near the Apple headset -- it's resonant, kind of like a telephone, there is little bass (and what there is is boomy and... resonant) and there is *no* detail. For $10, it's not worth the trouble to return them and I'll use them as a spare pair, but I wouldn't recommend these to anyone. You do get what you pay for."
2,Faulty glue,"I would love this product if it was not faulty. In trying to pull the jack out of my iPhone, the glue by the casing came loose. (No I am not wonder woman or anything, just your average Jill).Love the fit and feel on these headphones, otherwise.Too bad the plastic casing wiggles off of the metal jack."
2,I loved it until it BROKE!!!,"I liked the product being that it's hard to find a headset that's trully compatible with the iphone being that it does have the call button. Unfortunately it broke! I have no idea how or why it broke. I don't even remember any type of impact that could have caused this. So unfortunately I'd have to say although I liked the set, it must be pretty fragile!"
2,"Good function, Poor durability",These work good and I like the around the neck cable routing. The plug rubber wire cover has started to come off and the plug has started to com apart after only 3 weeks. I will be returning these but not sure what I can get in the same price range.ThanksVincent
3,Returning them..,"I didn't expect wonderful sound quality from cheapie headphones, but I expected them to sound better than my OEM iPhone headset. Unfortunately, they don't sound any better to me. I'm no audiophile, so I can't describe the sound well, but the bass is pretty lacking.The earbuds are pretty comfortable and fit well in my ear. The button is a little large, and even with the headset worn correctly, doesn't line up near my mouth at all so I couldn't use it for phone calls if I wanted to. The lanyard style is useful for someone who rarely takes the headset on and off, but I don't like the lanyard because I take the headset off and put it back on a lot throughout the day.One major drawback about this headset is the cord. Any time something brushes against the cord, you can hear the sound (loudly) through the earbuds.Also, the button is extremely finicky for me. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. I'll be returning this headset and waiting for a better one to come out.."
5,"Comfortable, good sound, great price","I bought these to replace the earbuds that came with my iPhone, and I have to admit these are 100 times better, which is surprising given how inexpensive they are. These fit my ears *perfectly*, unlike the Apple earbuds that just don't fit right. The sound quality isn't *quite* as good as the Apple earbuds, but I'm still very happy with it. Not only do they fit, they are very comfortable too. The in-line button works just like the iPhone earbuds.My only complaint is the length of the cord. It's a *little* too long. The Apple earbuds got the length just right, but these ones are about 6 inches too long and have some slack.Some people might also like to know that the cord is actually a fabric material, not black plastic like it appears in the picture. It doesn't get tangled as easily, and it looks pretty cool :-)I highly recommend this product!"
1,Not bad... until one earpiece died,"I used this product for about a month, and then somewhere between Beijing and Hyderabad the left earpiece died."
2,Warts and all...,"There aren't a whole lot of options for in-ear headphones with an accessible button out if you own an iPhone. Given the alternatives you really do get a lot of bang for your buck with these headphones. The sound quality is decent and the earbuds stay firmly in place, as opposed to the default ones which come with your iPhone.That said, I've just gone through my second pair. Each time I have had physical damage occur at the plug. The first time I removed the headphones while gripping the rubber casing around the plug, when I looked down I noticed that the plug remained solidly in the ipod and a frayed wire remained in my hand. The second time around the wire appears to have snapped inside the lanyard and I can no longer hear out of the left earbud.All in all, not horrible given how inexpensive they are (which is why I opted to give it two stars rather than one), but the manufacturing quality leaves quite a bit to be desired."
1,don't buy this,"this is a waste of money, I've thrown mine in the trash. The over the head, wrap around idea is really stupid (think using this in a car, i.e. your phone rings and you reach for your headset, etc.). The earpieces don't stay in your ears, and finally, the person on the other side of the line can't really hear you. Don't waste your money."
1,it broke - just like everyone said would happen,"i loved it for the first 3 days that it worked. decent sound, nice design. but here i am on day 4, and the sound just went out in 1 ear. i wish i'd saved the shipping box..."
1,Going...Going....Goooone,"Well,even though reviews said these headphones would last three weeks, I bought them anyway keeping my shipping box close in case of an emergency.I've had bad experiences with headphones and since then, I take care of my headphones like no one else.I loved the headphones, but two weeks of intense work proved to be too much for these. First the mic, then the left earbud, my headphones literally imploded.I am shipping it back.Do NOT give these buds a shot."
1,Simply Poor quality,Keep your original earphones that came with your Iphone. Do not waste the money on thesepoor quality earphones. The sound quality is extremely bad.
3,Great build medocre sound quality,"The fabric braided covered wires, the switch and the plug that fits the iPhone and the silicone sealing earbuds are all really first rate. The sound quality does not follow. Likely about tthe same as the lousy stock Apple buds. But they work and since they seal in your outer ear canal they do cut the background noise. Don't expect a sony 71 earbud quality sound here."
4,Surprisingly pleased,"Decent sound quality, very comfortable, amazing value. The method of wearing seems a bit peculiar at first, but actually makes sense, enhancing comfort and mobility. I'd surely buy another if this one broke."
2,"Liked the sound, but not the feel",I really liked the sound these put out. And they certainly isolated noise - I couldn't hear anything but what I was listing to when I had them on.Dislikes - they hurt my ears. I am wearing the smallest buds and after 6 hours of listening today - my ears still hurt 5 hours later. This has been going on for a week - I am getting ready to return them.The lanyard style is also weird. I need to be able to get on and off easily - I wind up getting them caught in my hair and my earrings.Will wait for someone else to come out with iphone compatible headphones.
2,Poor sound quality/bad design,"I bought these as a replacement my iPhone headphones. While they are inexpensive, I would not recommend them:*Odd design recommends hanging them in a loop around your neck, which is just inconvenient. If you don't do this, the mic will be in the wrong place. The cord is so long that it gets tangled very easily.*The fabric coating the cords creates a loud sound in the earpieces when it just brushes against your shirt. This gets annoying very quickly.*While the low end sound is decent, there's a real lack of clarity on the high end. I'm by no means an audiophile, but the sounds quality is much worse than standard iPod headphones.Overall, very poorly designed."
4,Affordable... Decent replacement,"I am no audiophile, but I found the sound on these earphones at least as good as the original earbuds that come with the iPhone. I like the lanyard as I find myself needed to pull out my earbuds frequently. They are left in convenient place for a geek like me to return to listening. Plus, in the car, I can easily keep one earbud in for phone calls."
1,bad design,"No comment on sound quality. However, the way the cord splits from the microphone fob for no good reason is stupid and causes more tangles than needed. The microphone is so far from your mouth, that it almost doesn't work. Don't get this one."
1,bad music from a bad club,this was very dizzappointing-just like that druggy club was. i got this as a gift. it is dizmal muzic.
4,Altus Athletic ADG Home Door Gym,The door gym is very easy to set up and is good for light to moderate resistance. This product is definately worth the $30.00 I paid for it. It also makes a great travel gym to take with you on vacation as it fits most doors.
4,Three phones are so practical.,"Three handsets are just right for any large family to stay in touch without yelling through the house, but my favorite feature is conferencing between headsets. ""Come down and help with dinner please"" without leaving the kitchen! The clip on the back makes it easy to stay connected while you are doing housework or relaxing in the yard. I can even go half way down the block and still have great reception. Please note: They have proved to not be water proof so set them well away from the side of the hot tub."
5,cordless phones,"These phones were an excellent buy. I was specifically looking for a product that came with at least 3 handsets, ws expandable to 5 handsets and had a digital answering machine. Very easy to program. I have used Panasonic cordless in prior homes and just love them. The new models have smaller handsets which I like. They have a mute button and speaker phone-perfect for all those conferences call when telecommuting. I highly recommend this product. Amazon had the best price-even with shipping."
3,Expected better performance at this price,"Pro'sLight weight and stylishLimited interference w/ 2.8 Ghz wireless internetVery loud and clear speakerphoneGood to average sound quality when placing callsCon'sScratches easilyOccasional static on the phoneVery low calling volumeDisplays 'call missed' on handset when call is not answered on those handsets,even though the call was answered.Price is too high for an average phoneAfter reading everyones reviews I was expecting to recieve a high quality phone. Unfortunetly, all these ""high"" ratings are a bunch of hype for an over priced phone. The phone has average performance. I would advise to wait until the phone is in te low $100's to buy unless you want to waste your money and be disappointed w/ the results."
3,Very good phone,This is one of the best phones on the market. Very user friendly. My parents have had many cordless phones and could never figure them out. They have no problems with this one. It has many features and a menu system that makes them all easy to use. It does have a few features that are not needed like changing colors for message alerts. These are marketing tricks but they don't detract from the phones usefulness. The voice enhancer is another feature that they market heavily but is basically useless. The reason I give it 3 stars is the caller ID does not work correctly on the handsets. If a call is picked up on one phone it will mark it as a missed call on the others. Previous models worked this way and there is no excuse for this not being corrected.
3,"Good, solid phone, with some problems","Overall, this is a good, solid landline phone. Excellent features and voice sound quality. My only gripe is that the greeting on the answering machine is muddled and hard to understand. Also, the display indicates the number of missed calls that are actually received calls; it does not distinguish between missed and received."
5,Excellent though with some quirks,"These are excellent phones with great range and sound quality. Small size and lots of features. My ony gripes with the system are: there is no way to program the phone handsets to NOT keep recording ""received and missed calls"". Since I have 3 handsets if I use one mainly near me it still records ""received and missed"" calls on the other handsets in the house - which then I would have to manually erase. Stupid. Also, when using the hand sets the response time from one function to the other is delayed by the phone's internal programming and there is no way to simply jump to the next function without having to wait for the one you're using to ""time out."" Stupid, again."
3,Not as good as a Uniden TRU 9496,"This phone is good but has a couple problems for meno ability to become 2 line operation like the uniden TRU seriesthe speakerphone on each handset is nice but you have to use it all the time since the regular handset was often time too quiet for others and they would say they can't hear you when you are not speaking right into the mic of the handset.Kinda of looks nicer than the TRU series phone from Uniden and the small buttons would most likely be a problem for older people but the lack of ringtones is much worst the the size of the buttons.The built in answering machine is nice as sometimes it is misleading that there is only a ""digital answering system"". It would be nice if phone had both of these built in rather than typically one or the other.also battery life could be better."
5,Best value for money,"We bought this phone after using many different cordless phones so far.But we are so satisfied with this phone, we now think why didn't buy this phone before and waited so long.we are very impressed with the additional sets which work just with power supply, so we can use anywhere in the house .It is the best value for the money."

2,Not as Expected,"The album was well done but it was not what I expected. The songs chosen were too slow, I only watched half of the DVD."
2,"Disappointing, doesn't work on Macs","I needed a replacement USB drive and was hoping this purchase would have quelled that need for a long while. Came in good package and looked rather sleek, but it's continuous problems with Mac computers has left me unsatisfied. Roughly 1 out of every 10 times I plug it in will it actually detect on my computer, which I first thought was on my end, but after trying it out at my college's computers seems to be a recurring issue and one that is annoying to deal with. Seems to work fine with PC's but since I don't have one anymore and its purpose is to transfer files to any computer needed, it's a regret on my part. It's possible mine was just a freak occurrence to have this issue, but it's still a regrettable purchase."
3,Mislabeled Pattern,"This pattern is not Wallace Rockport. If you go to any of the Wallace sites and look for Rockport, this is not the pattern."
5,perfect for the holidays,It was just what I was looking for. A roaring fire glass of wine and the perfect christmas music.
3,Really nice cd,"This is a really mellow, relaxing Christmas cd. John David has a really nice touch on the guitar. I played it Christmas day, and it really set up a nice, peaceful, natural atmosphere."
3,Nice Album,"For me, ""Things to Come"" by Seventh Wave was a main stay at University in the early seventies. It was great; putting on the headphones and doing homework to music of the sorts. I still have that LP. Someday, I hope to own the CD version. Maybe, one of the sellers will accept $18.98 (American), for his or her [IMPORT]!?! With reluctant anticipation, I'll be checking from time to time."
4,A must hear.,"A great example of early synthesizer music! Reminding you of a time when it seemed like music was going to take off in a new and exciting way. Released in 1974, Ken Elliot, keyboards and vocals, and Kieran O'Connor, percussion, do a wonderful job, even in today's standards! In my opinion, this was the beginning of the PROG type sound of today."
5,This is a great care plan book,I am a nursing student. I have 4 care plan books that i use when writing a care plan. I use this one alot because its: simply stated and i find rationales in it that the other books don't have. Its worth the money.
5,Must have for Nursing Students,"This is one of the best nursing diagnosis books on the market. It is easy to use, very understandable, and the layout is extraordinary. I use this book for all of my care plans and to cross reference with other care plan books. This book is every penny worth the cost."
4,Good Book for care plans from Amazon!,"Very good book, lots of good information and at a great price!!!I like this edition better than the one that comes next!!!"
4,Comfortable inflatable PFD,This is my second SOSpenders auto-inflate PFD with harness. The changes are mostly cosmetic. It is comfortable to wear and work in over anything from a t-shirt to full foulies. I particularly like the double D-rings for attachment to jacklines since that design does not depend on the integrity of the plastic buckle to keep me on the boat. Recommended.
3,cwest,"I bought two of these, one for me and one fror my wife. They were both the same, adult universal. Well in that universe there must only be small people. They fit my wife OK, but were way too small for me, I am 6 4 and 250. Way too small for me."
4,A nice collection,"A good, diverse selection of songs. On a few, the quality is not the greatest (i.e. some slight vibration, echo, background noise) but overall the selection is of good quality."
2,Not for newcomers to DirectX,"This book does not explain the basics, like what files to include, and is vague on where to put your code. If you have ever gone through the code generated by AppWizard, you know this could be very daunting. For programmers who are very familiar with DirectX implementation, I would recommend it. If you are not, keep looking."
2,Programming is good reference for direct 2.0 and lower,"I found the book to be helpful for programming in sdk, but it is outdated. The code does not work unless you use direct 2.0 or less. With a little practice,which helps,you can get everything to work. I would not recommend for 1st timers."
3,"Overall, not a bad reference","This book was designed for use with DirectX 1.0 (GameSDK), not the later versions. Any attempt to get the sample code to work with DirectX 2.0 or higher leads to miserable results. Like many other people, I could not get the samples from the CD to work, and when they did compile they GPF'd. The book does, however, give a good foundation for game programming and has a decent section on sound and music. A more updated version, with better compatibility, would be nice."
3,The book covers playing midi music files under win95!,"I am a developer that has about 3 game programming books, 5 graphic books and about 10 other programming books. Out of all of them the only one I found that covered playing MIDI files was this book. This was a godsend. The class, covered in chapter 17, is called CMIDIStream. Playing a midi file seems to be horribly complex even with windows multimedia functions. This book provides you a class and enough documentation to get you started to put midi playing functionality into your game. The class itself isn't wonderfully implimented, but its a START and at least it works. Also, something that really threw me of when trying to use it was that midi files need to be converted into MSU format by the MID2STRM program provided at www.microsoft.com. (do a search). Otherwise the book is ok reading material, although I only use it as reference material"
2,"Out of Date, DANGER, do not use with Eclipse 3.2 !!!","Good book, except..., the code samples are embedded in a plugin that only works with Eclipse 3.1. I tried 3 times on Mac OS X to load the code samples some way, including the book's website, and disaster happens. Not only does the code not show up, but all my closed Eclipse projects opened up, and my entire Eclipse 3.2 crashed big time... I was doing fine going through the tutorial, Hyperbola ( a chat room app), and then the book gets to the point where it forces you to install the code samples from their website. You are stuck if you have Eclipse 3.2 running."
3,Not For Web Developers,"The book look like it has some promise. Unfortunately, it does not even touch those things that are important to web developers. There is no mention of setting up servers in eclipse, publishing, remote debugging, etc....If you are looking to do standalone applications or you want to know just the very basics of eclipse, this may be great for you. It goes through some basic stuff systematically with clear explanations and diagrams. However, if you need to do web development, please look somewhere else."
4,Eclipse Rich Client Platform,"This book provides a nice introduction and overview to the Eclipse Rich Client Platform, and is a good alternative to reading all the tutorials and articles scattered around the web. I found that most of the topics I was interested in were covered, but there are gaps (e.g. nothing about multi-page views, undo/redo support, form-based editors, or headless applications), and some of the topics aren't covered in much detail (there is a total of 7 pages devoted to testing, good luck figuring out e.g. how to run your tests in a headless build). I also question the choice of a sample application that needs to connect to a server (XMPP) in order to run, but the code printed in the book is concise and well explained. I didn't import or run the code, so I can't comment on the problems other people have reported."
5,"Nicely organized ""Teach by Example"" book","I purchased 8 copies and distributed them to our team. Several team members went through each chapter, building the sample application on top of the Eclipse RCP. Each of us, whether or not we built the application, have learned a great deal about using Eclipse. I highly recommend this book to any software team that is starting a new product or that is in the throes of refactoring / recasting an old one. The book will jump-start your Eclipse experience."
1,Loading Code will Destroy Your Eclipse Installation,"If you have a current installation of Eclipse and you are using JPA (ex: Hibernate), don't even think about using the book's update site. It will totally hose up your entire Eclipse installation and you are looking at a complete re-installation.It's a shame, because otherwise the book seems to be very helpful. Rumor is that they are planning an update sometime late 2008, but none of the bookstores have a publication date on it yet."
5,"Serene, yet quietly complex.","A beautiful album put together from the soundtrack of an even more beautiful film. I was not familiar with French classical music before being introduced to this collection of soothing string music. The sound is quiet without being timid, and complex without being debatable. The only accompaniment I would recommend would be a yoga mat and a peaceful view."
3,Violent Satire,"Man Bites Dog is an odd movie about a camera crew who follows around a serial killer and his friends. It's filmed in black and white and it's one of those films that breaks the fourth wall.. It's like they took a video camera and started filming a mental case and the audience gets to watch as he goes from nice guy to killer. Around his family hes nice and when alone and around his friends hes psycho.As far as it being disturbing its about a 7-8 out of 10. Some parts were deeply disturbing, others funny. It's hard to imagine how anything could be funny in a movie like this but they managed to mix disturbing with humor. One scene will have you laughing, another will have you shaking your head.I really couldn't say what I liked or didnt like about this film. It didn't strike me as anything great yet it wasn't terrible. If it was anything it was definitely out of the norm.The whole thing is in French. Do not get this if you have a weak stomach. Its very graphic."
3,Laugh?,"I've seen the uncut version of Man Bites Dog. Could be an age thing, but I didn't laugh. I wanted to vomit. Killing a child, raping and mutilating is funny? Compelling for sure, but be wary of those who think call this humor. And for god's sake, don't watch it with kids!"
4,SHOCKING EUROPIAN GANSTA-MOVIE,"'Man Bite Dog' is from Belgium. But the movie is influenced by Jean Luc Godard and Quentin Tarrantino, and does away with all formalities like Godard's spirit. The violent depicts of evil is so eccentric! excellent!!!!!!!!! @.@"
5,Twisted humor at its best.,"This film is a ""documentary"" about the life of a callous serial killer. While the protagonist can go around killing people with no remorse, during the breaks from ""filming"", we see that the killer is also entirely capable of having congenial conversation with the ""film crew"". After a meal, they go back to work, continuing to document the killer's ""work"". What I found so hilarious about this was the matter-of-fact manner in which the documentary is made to be done. The very notion that a serious group of film-makers would think of doing a film on a serial killer, and actually record his killing people, is so preposterous, that it ends up being very funny!"
4,Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Belgian Cinema...,"As a Belgian my comments may be biased, but when it came out I knew people would have to talk about this little gem. If nothing else it showed what low-budget headaches on the part of the producers can generate in terms of brilliant inventiveness: a pseudo-documentary about a quite ""personable"" serial killer. Many people see this flick as a rabid satire on reality tv and media violence. I agree. But, think about it, just the idea of the setup is fantastic. For those who are interested in watching this, like always, be certain to get the uncut version (unless you want to censored), because American censorship is still alive and kicking!"
4,A must for film lover,"If a good film is a film that will implant some outstanding scene in your mind for a long time (or forever), then Man Bites Dog is highly successful. This is a very uncomfortable movie. The horror, no matter it is from the graphical sense, or from the subtlety from say the narration, is a pure challenging experience from everyone. The documentary-style is not totally believable (if you compare with say Blair Witch), but it demonstrates the expertise and supremacy on film-making, especially from a country we are not usually familiar with - Belgium. Highly recommended."
4,Disturbing,"where did the crewmen find this serial killer? At first, they won't even share a beer with him because he is so distasteful to them. By the end of the movie they are helping him dipose of bodies that will potentially be discovered. My interpretaion of this film is that the director was trying to poke fun at journalism and it's minions. Can you imagine cameramen filming the murder of a child without becoming involved in trying to stop it? All for the sake of the story."
2,Don't Kid Yourself...,"This film was pretty weak. I realize it is a low budget satire about the film industry and society at large. But this film is far from providing any useful commentary on these far reaching and noble subjects. It was just a poorly made and poorly written series of disjointed scenes. The director was trying to intertwine his social theories into the dialogue. So maybe it was lost in translation. But whatever the case, the film did not live up to its billing. If you want satire, try Kubrick. If you want a low budget blood bath try Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1973). And if you want a bloodbath with social commentary, try American Psycho. The bottom line is there are much better films that cover the same topics and fill the same niche."
2,Glorified Saturday Night Live Sketch,"Very disappointed with this film. This film is really nothing more than a glorified Saturday Night Live sketch- you get the joke in the first thirty seconds and the remaining hour and a half is more of the same. People refer to this film as poignant commentary concerning the media's obsession with violence. It's really not. See Natural Born Killers- its much more effective-if this is the subject matter which pricks your interest. I would really give this 2.5 stars but you can't on Amazon, so I rounded down. It's definitely not a three star movie. So there."
2,Byron: Overrated Romantic,"Byron's poems don't seem to seek to make any statements. Unlike his Romantic contemporaries Keats, Coleride, and Wordsworth, (even Shelley, to some extent) Byron puts forth no idealogy as to what poetry should be. Instead, he relies on certain aspects of that Romantic idealogy, such as frequent parallels between the state of man and the state of nature... however, with few excceptions, this fails to create unique insights, comments, or even descriptions in his writings. What results is florid, wordy, rhyming travel writing, often promoting British or macho ideals. This edition receives a low grade because it fails to lead me to any better of an impression of a poet that has obviously been influential and looked on as an esteemed figure for so many years. This book can be read as an interesting historical document, and, perhaps most importantly, as Romantic poetry falls out of favor, Byron's poetry as collected within helps to explain the reason why."
5,This is the movie you have to see,"I watched this movie yesterday and I must say that I couldn't sleep very well last night. This is scary movie! It's a lot of more scarier than Scream, Scream 2, I Know What You Did Last Summer etc. In this movie, every second is so scary. All the time something happens... Murders, weird things, nightmares... I think that this isn't a teenage horror movie, because it's so scary. The greatest in directing is that the guy who's watching this have to afraid of something all the time. This is till great movie, and I bet you like this! If you are 12-30 years old..."
3,Good but not great,"The Halloween series is one of the best horror series out there. I personally think every entry to this series was good to a point, i like em all. Now Halloween H20 is a very ver good movie, but it seems to miss some of the magic and atmoshpere of the other films; including three. I think that H20 shoud tied in ALL the entries but alsa it only focuses on 1-2. The thorn sub polt is great, and gives a little clarity to the celtic word written in blood in part 2. Hopefully in the next entry they will tie in EVERYTHING. I also that the movie pack in the suspense, but the scares were limited for me since the mask in all my bluntness is stupid looking. It seems to show to much expression. In the other films the mask looked like pure unadultrted evil. If they had another mask from any of the other movies I would believe that this movie would have been a lot higher in the scare factor."
2,Very bad film,"This is a real BAD film!!! Comparing to the other new sacarry movies, it's even worst than Urban Legend!! You think it doesn't exist? Watch it!! It's well done, but the story and the screemplay are terrible."
5,BEST ONE YET!,"now here is one that lives up to the original.after an awful! 5th installment, this gem comes along!it has a typical story, but it works, because they got ppl that could act. cool beggining and end, that make u wonder..."
5,20 Years Later: ENTER LAURIE STRODE,"It was great to see Jaime Lee Curtis back in full force again. Michael Myers is back with 2 things on his mind, killing his sister Laurie and killing everyone that gets in his path. Laurie has many flashbacks of her brother in the beginning of the film until, she is face to face with him in a window of a door. Josh Hartnett plays Laurie's son John and does a pretty good job as a newcomer to the big screen. This movie I thought was a very good one and tries to stick with the original formula of the first one. However, very inferior to the one that started it all. IMO, absolutely no horror movie will ever surpass Halloween, period! If you are new to the Halloween series I would STRONGLY suggest watching the first and second ones before this. If you are a fan of the series it's a no brainer, if you are like me, you've owned this movie for some time now."
2,Scary? I think NOT!,"I LOVE the Halloween movie series, but Halloween H20 is one of the worst since Halloween 3! Take the following things for example:1. Not even really scary! 2. Almost NO gore at all! 3. It acted if as Halloween 4-6 never happened! 4. The storyline is just stupid! 5. Not even the REAL Michael Myers....I think!This is very bad! If you still want to see this, DO NOT buy it....a waste of money! Just rent it or something."
3,An enjoyable effort,"This was an enjoyable film for the Halloween fans, but it forgot one very important issue. Laurie Strodes daughter. Even if Laurie was in hiding she would not have gone without her daughter, Jamie (Halloween 4 and 5). Otherwise, not a bad effort for a final episode in the series. And what is up with the DVD? Did everyone who purchased the DVD return it? I did. I was furrious at the false advertisement on the packaging. I refused the DVD and returned it for a full refund. If everyone does, maybe the makers will get the picture."
3,LIERS!,"I bought this DVD because I realy loved this movie, and I would have given it 5 stars if the DVD cover didn't say that this DVD contains an audio commentary by the director Steve Miner and Jamie Lee Curtis. if this (would have been great) audio commentary exist then ahy the hell can't I access it. I've tried pressing on the audio button on my remote control (doesn't work) and it doesn't exist on the bonus materials menu. If anybody owns this DVD and has manneged to access this audio commentary PLEEEEAAASE let me know. thanks."
1,curtis can't save this mess,"jamie lee curtis must have been offered a lot of money to be in this waste of her talent and our time. at least i hope so. not sacry just pure junk,not even any chaem or so bad it's good to help this mess. just stinks!!!!!!"
1,pretty bad!,"Halloween H20,another chance to try to cash in on the success of 1978's Halloween.They brought back Jamie Lee Curtis to try to intice fans,other are a few other big names involved also.This time it's just too boring.The movie is half the way through before you even see any killings or anything good like that.I say avoid this stinker!"
1,They cant be serious,"The Halloween series is a well respected one in the world of horror films. Its the series we run to when we wish to escape the flat boring teenie bopper horror we are now faced with like Scream and I know what you did last summer... Well not this time. This new Halloween installment ignores all that has happened past Halloween II but this is not the problem. It has a flat script that is lacking in its ability to scare, thanks to Scream scribe, Kevin Williamson. Hasn't he proven to us enough that he cannot write anything scary? The worst abomination is Chris Durand. This stuntman clearly didnt do his homework, his rendition of Michael Myers is laughable He moves wrong he's much to fast and not at all methodical or creepy.. all in all avoid this entry unless you really enjoy seeing teenie bopper films."
3,Jamie Lee Curtis makes a welcome return,"The first was great, the second was good, but 3-6 were completely rubbish so with this film I was not expecting much. But I was pleasantly surprised to find that H20 is as good as the second film. Basically it completely ignores the stories of the last four sequals and begins 20 years after the first Halloween. With Jamie Lee Curtis making a long awaited return to the series as Micheal's long suffering little sister. The film complete forgets the fact that Lorrie had a Daughter who featured in the Halloweens 4 through 6 and instead gives her a son (Josh Hartnett) who secretly stays at a bording school when his mother thinks he has gone on a school trip.Of course the ""Shape"" turns up for some late night classes and terrorizes the young group of partiers.LL Cool J gives some light comic relief as the security guard who wishes to be a romantic novelist."
5,Great movie,"I have only see halloween,Halloween 2, and halloween h20 and i think this seiries is the best. This movie is great and worth seing. Very scary... I love micheal myers and i hope they keep up the great halloween movies!!!!! I recomend this movie to every one!"
5,The best Halloween sequel out there!!!!!!,"This movie is the bomb! And I thought Halloween 2 was a good sequel. This movie destroys Halloween 2 , but Halloween 2 is still 3rd in the Halloween sequels. I never thought that a Halloween movie would ever come out that would be on par with Halloween. This movie is very suspensful and full of action. The action really heats up at the end when Laurie takes the ax and ends it in one quick swipe! The only complaint that I have about this movie is its length. It is only like Disney movie length. But you will enjoy the ride the whole way through!!! I highly recommend it! Buy it now!!!!!!!!!"
5,THE BEST SINCE THE ORIGINAL!!!,I THOUGHT THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT MOVIE!! JAMIE LEE CURTIS WAS AWSOME AND THE PLOT WAS GREAT! VERY GOOD ENDING. I JUST THOUGHT THE MOVIE COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LONGER. A MUST SEE FOR HALLOWEEN FANS.
5,"I thought ""Halloween H20"" rocked!","I thought that the film was excellent, stunning and scary!! That person from Brett Bishop Roy, Utah is wrong!!!!! This movie was neat and Jamie Lee Curtis made an Oscar wurthy performance! I own the movie so I have probobly seen it 34 times! Michelle Williams and Josh Harett gave an excellent performance too! I have seen all the Halloween's and I think ""H20"", 2 and 6 were the best!!! If I were incharge if movies, I would vote this ""Best film of the year!"" And that bitch that I mentioned earlier, I thought that all the movies she thought sucked, were good! I give H20 *****!"
4,H20 Review,Awesome. I mean it was a little confusing but awesome all the same. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Michael Myers's sister very well. It was an exellent blood bath like most of the Halloween movies. It was a little confusing trying to figure out which of the two was the REAL Michael Myers. I liked this movie although I wouldn't recommend it for viewers with weak stomachs.
4,THE BEST ''HALLOWEEN'' IN YEARS,"THIS SEQUEL REALLY PUT MICHAEL MYERS BACK ON TRACK. IN THIS ONE; MICHAEL RETURNS 20 YEARS LATER TO FINISH OFF HIS SISTER [JAMIE LEE CURTIS], WHO IS NOW A TEACHER AT A PRIVATE SCHOOL IN CALIFORNIA, AND HAS A SON [JOSH HARTNETT]. THIS MOVIE IS REALLY THRILLING, ESPECIALLY THE ENDING. ONLY MAJOR FLAW; CASTING LL COOL J. LL HAS NO PURPOSE IN THIS MOVIE. THIS IS THE BEST SEQUEL THAT ''HALLOWEEN'' HAS TO OFFER. AND THE PLOT SEEMS TO IGNORE ALL OF WHAT HAPPENED IN HALLOWEEN 3-6. OTHER THAN THAT, THIS MOVIE IS GREAT AND IT'S UP THERE WITH THE ORIGINAL."
4,Maltin Type Review,"By far the best in the series, this one re-introduces Jamie Lee Curtis to the succesful little series. Now the headmistress of a private school, Laurie Strode (Curtis) is living under the assumed name of Keri Tate and trying to get on with her life, but on Halloween night, her favorite masked killer shows up for a little fun. This film is great fun. Curtis looks and acts great in reprising her first ever role. Rated R ***1/2 out of ****"
3,"None scary, but an OK entry...","Kevin Williamson ... apparently loves the Halloween movies, or so i heard. If he really does, then he should have kept his hands on his own franchise instead of ruining John Carpenter's masterpiece. The idea and plot for the movie was ok, but dissgarding the previous sequels (from part 3 to 6) was a really ridicoulus idea. Also having almost no murder sequences and attempting to make it more ""Scream"" was a biiiig mistake. The actors was to live with, but director Steve Miner, who directed the dumbest entries in the Friday The 13th franchise (part 2 & 3), was a huuuge mistake as well. Buy the six first movies instead, and skip this movie and the 8th one..."
3,"It's not the first one, but, what the hell !","Okay, alright, that's not the first and original Halloween, the director isn't John Carpenter, is Steve Miner, ok, ok. But, god, what the hell, it's Michael Myers and Laurie Strode, together for a last revenge after long twenty years ! Jamie Lee Curtis still made a wonderful job, as a very beautiful and intelligent Laurie Strode and Michael Myers still very cruel ( not scary ). And there's the ultimate scene where mother meets daughter : Janet Leigh, Marion Crane from Psycho with Jamie Lee Curtis from the original Halloween. Can you handle that ? And after all, Janet says : ""Let me be a little maternal for a moment..."""
5,The Best Halloween Yet,"I thought that Halloween H2O was even better then the first. i don't exactly know why I liked it so much but it was awesome. Jamie Lee Curtis was great, she is a great horror movie actor, the horror queen. i didn't think it was the scariest movie ever but it just plain ruled. the best Halloween ever:Halloween H2O. if you liked any of the other halloween movies or if you like hrror movies then you will love this movie. go out and rent it or buy it today! the movie rocked!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent Movie! A MUST SEE!,Excellent movie. Gives you lots of chills and laughs. Jamie Lee Curtis rocked this movie. Josh Hartnett and Michelle Williams bring a fresh taste to this trilogy. A must see no matter what genre you like!
3,great movie,"this is a good movie, but i think the whole halloween thing was played out long ago. But other than that this is a movie worth seeing. Since Josh Hartnet is so hot. I just hope this is finally the last halloween movie."
2,Don't waste the money!!,This movie was a horrifing 1st he jumped out the window and was still alive then she crashed the alumbance and he was still alive then she finally chopped of his head. How stupid can you make a movie. The movie was so Fake not even realistaic in real life one bit.
2,"TOTAL CAMP, IT IS A MASSACRE INDEED...ON THE VIEWER!!!!","Steve Miner the dreaded director of Friday the 13th parts 2 and 3 hands us a hand full of nothing with the badly acted, poorly directed and disasterly written crap that is H20....whats with H20 anyway? It has no kind of balance on anything, it takes place after the first film....But they mention the fire that happened in the fifth film. Jamie Lee Curtis makes a laughable come back (from what?) with her poor ass performance as Laurie Strode. I hated this movie. The only thing that gave me a jolt was when Jamie finally sees Micheal for the first time since the first film. When they look at each other through the window..Thats powerful stuff right there for ya. But the rest I thought was total camp. The body count was terrible, acting was worse then crap and the writing was close to Spice World material. My God this movie had no substance. Steve Miner should just stick to Comedies cause this movie made me laugh."
2,It wasn't bad. But I was bit disapointed.,"H20 was not scary (unlike Halloween 4 Now that's a horror movie) The only freaky part was the part in the road side bathroom, when it looked like he saw her in the stall. But the ending was dumb. If she chopped of his head that means there will be no more Halloween movies (but hey, thats what you thought about Chuckie)"
2,Not scary.,"This wasn't the most horrible movie I've ever seen in my life, but for a horror movie it wasn't scary at all. A lot of things that happened were so unrelistic! For example, L.L. Cool J.'s character got shot several times, and you are sure he has to be dead, but he returns being minimally hurt. The movie starts out good, but gets boring. It could have been made a lot better."
4,Great Closing to the Michael Meyers Saga!,Halloween H2O was a good show even though it was short. The ending was befitting of Michael Meyers. It took Jamie Lee Curtis how many episodes to decapitate Michael? Could she have done it sooner? I say yes.
4,Good...but some dialog screw up's!,"I did like this movie but two problems. 1. Since when was Michel Myers her brother? 2. In the beginning it shows her year book picture saying she is a 1978 graduate. If the first murders took place October 31, 1978 she would have graduated June 1979 not 1978.The movie company should be fined for screwing that up so bad. But I did enjoy the movie."
1,If you love Halloween make beleive this movie was never made,"WHY , WHY , WHY ,would they take a series of movies that essentially ""started it all"" and totally change the style? Scream, Urban Legend, I Know What You Did last Summer and the rest of those films ...! So why is halloween H20 just like it????? Beats me, MICHAEL MYERS SOLD OUT!! ..."
2,A little better but...,this film tries to recapture the spirit of the 1st two but by doing this basically disregards h3-6. So much for continuality. This should have been the end but they just had to make pt8 which makes H20's ending look stupid. H8 has no chance of being good
2,a stupid halloween film,"i really did not like this halloween because it was not scary and the mask was bad and the guy who played michael myers did even act like michael. This movie forgot about 4,5 and 6 of the halloween movies. i would of gave it 1 star but the halloween series is my favorite and i cant wait to see halloween 8 this October !!!!"
3,It was not so great.,"I am a really huge Halloween fan and was a little dissapointed in this one. First of all it was not as scary. Second, there were only 6 killings.Halloween 1-6 had more killings than this one did, you would think this one would have more killings since it was the latest installment. It was still good but not as good as the others. I don't suggest you buy it unless you need to complete the Halloween collection at home."
1,"Another ""Scream"" clone and here is why","1.The plot is a masked killer is stalking teenagers in California(ala ""Scream"")2.They use the music score from ""Scream""3.They watch ""Scream 2"" and in ""Scream"" their watching ""Halloween""4.In one scene Jamie Lee Curtis saids:Get to the Beckers houes(Hello, Casey Becker from ""Scream"")Dont waste your time on this stupid,cheesy ""Scream"" rip off."
4,AT LAST A SEQUEL WORTH WATCHING!,"This entry into the halloween series is probably about as good as it is gonna get! After two really really bad installments(parts 5 and 6) we get a pretty darn good sequel ""Halloween H20"". The best thing about the movie is that Jamie Lee Curtis is back and it makes all the difference. I still don't understand why they keep changing Michael's mask? It looked great in the first movie...why fix what ain't broke? This movie is really a 3 and 1/2 star movie,but they don't have that option. The DVD transfer is good,but I would like to see a 16X9 upgrade someday."
1,4-6 are conclude well4 anyway,this movies bad but in the begining you see pitchers on loomis wall one has the bloody scisors trhat jamie stabed her stepmother with laurie far from hadon field they never found his body the escape halloween 4 miuchal would have gone to find laurie put the docter said a niece lived in hadonfdield plus he might of thought laurie was dead after killing jamie hew goes after laurie after heescaped in pt.6 actually theres just evidence that parts 4-5 happened theres no evidence of p.6 hope that helps
3,Is Michael Dead?,"Michael is after his sister Laurie Strode (Curtis) again, this time she has a new identity and career. Halloween seems to be returning to the stage of thrills, chills, and suspence. Although I would like an answer as to why Michael just stopped hunting down his niece's baby that he was after in Halloween 6 and just decided to go after his sister again. Overall, an improvement in the series and is entertaining enough for the average halloween fan. Supposably the last installment. But the way movies are these days, anything is possible."
3,Scary movie! Two nice guys!,"Great movie: scary, funny, and two hott guys! Josh needs to comb his hair DESPARATELY but he's still a fox. And Jamie's boyfriend Adam is loomingly attractive. Luscious lips too. These movies need to think a little more about including male nudity, though. A good idea or what?"
1,The worst horror movie ever!,"I heard that this was a good movie so I rushed out to rent it, mainly because I love horror movies. After I finished watching it I was bored and unsatisfied.Because I live in Australia, this movie was rated ""M15+"" (that's PG13+ to you).I think it barely derserved to be rated PG. It was so STUPID! Everything, right down to the blood was OBVIOUSLY fake and it was WAY too over the top and too hammed up to be even SLIGHTLY scary.Take my advice.... don't rent this movie unless your DESPARATE and I mean REALLY desparate!"
3,Dawson's Creek Vs. Michael Myers,"I just don't see why everyone loves this film so much and some feel it's on par with the original. Sure Jamie Lee returning was great to see but this film has the feel of all the teen slasher films of that era with all the pretty looking teen stars. It's basically Michael Myers Vs. Dawson's Creek. Many will say the series started to go downhill with part 6, which I disagree with and actually didn't think was nearly as bad as most feel (director's cut is much better) but I think it started here. It does have it's moments but it's nowhere near as good as the first two films and even Parts 4 and 5 though I must admit it's better than the Halloween: Resurrection, the worst of the series (not counting Halloween III)."
2,SO overrated...,"It seems that the only reason people say that this is the best Halloween sequel, and that it matches the style of the original, yadda, yadda, yadda, is because Jaime Lee Curtis revives her role as Laurie Strode. It is WAY overrated, and it truly boggels me why so many people give it *** stars and up. It's not scary AT ALL, and it doesn't even LOOK like it's taking place on Halloween. And it's just BORING. But I really can't give it under two stars. It's just not THAT bad. I wouldint reccomend it unless you feel you must watch every Halloween movie."
2,H20,"The past decade has seen the fall of the horror movie we used to know and love, horror movies are no longer suspenseful, nowadays they consintrate on the teen casts, and their lifes. Its the same in H20, they should have called it ""I know what you did last summer with micheal myers"". What happened to the genuine horror films of the 70's and 80's."
1,one of the worst of the series,"H20 is a major disappointment. It ranks with 3(Season of the Witch, a non-Michael Myers sequel in name only) & part 6 as the worst of the Halloween flicks. I have always considered Michael to be the best slasher character since the original Halloween was first released. I wanted to like this, I really did, but it was terrible. The story was pathetic, the climax was anything but climactic, the acting was lackluster, and Michael just wasn't as menacing as he's supposed to be. The only good moment in the film is when Jamie Lee and her mother(PSYCHO) have an amusing verbal exchange in the parking lot...nothing to build a movie around. I'm a Halloween fan, but, man...this was BAD. I'd advise you to stick with the first two movies, if you need more, then skip three and skip this!"
5,Halloween Horror Hour,"This movie exceeds all expectations. Now I love the original Halloween and liked Halloween II. After those though, I don't believe a good Halloween was made until this movie. A lot of that has to do with that Jamie Lee Curtis suggested this movie which was released 20 years after her original debut. This movie had an amazing writer and director who realized that a good horror movie goes light on the gore and heavy on the story. I would recommend this movie for any time your in a scary movie mood or for an awesome Halloween Night Marathon."
4,a good movie,after halloween 2 jamie lee curtis decited to stop making horror movies she went on to be famous but twenty years after she started acting in halloween she decited to make halloween h20 part seven but they made this a great movie thhey completle ignored part three through part six and went on to continue the story line in halloween and halloween 2 it is a really good movie it is the second best sequel halloween 2 is the best sequel
4,Good effort,"For being a 7th movie in a horror series, I expected this movie to plain awful, even with Jamie Lee Curtis in it. I was pleasantly surprised.Halloween H20 was much more than just another movie about kids getting together performing several naughty acts and paying the price for it. There was actually some plot to it with excellent character development (Curtis & Hartnett), and a fair amount of suspense.Unfortunately, it's impossible to live up the first Halloween. H20, while a good effort, falls a bit short of the original Halloween in the thrills & chills department. It just isn't as effective. But I think the movie is still worth it's weight, and is arguably the 2nd best in the series."
4,Best Halloween Sequel.... since 2,"One heck of alot better than 3-6, not as good as 2, and Resurrection can't even hold a match to it. I liked it. It would have been a good way to end the series... but the producers see the green, not the films. I guess we can try again at killing Michael Myers...."
5,Still Great 20 Years Later!,"This was a very good movie. Although I prefer when they take place in Haddonfield, they made up for it by bringing back my idol, Jamie Lee Curtis. This movie was pretty scary, and I totally recommend it."
1,A disgrace to one of my favorite horror series,After seeing all Halloweens about 6 times i figured i would never see a movie as bad as Halloween III but H20 came pretty close.This movie was very predictable and had a very big story screw up in it.My man Mike would'nt have waited 20 years to kick some butt.Anyone thinking of buying this movie dont waste your money.If you want a Halloween buy Halloween4 or 5.
1,Halloween H20 Predictable and Badly Written,"Halloween H20 is the worst scary movie other than I Know What You Did Last Summer. One question: Why would Micheal wait 20 years to kills his sister's son? Lame, lame, lame. I hate this movie. Hollywood: Stop throwing out bad scary movies just for money! It's starting to be annoying. For example: I Still Know What You Did Last Summer? What was that? The title is even wrong. She killed him the summer before that. I Still Know sounds better!"
1,Pain... Just sitting through it,"It was a real disappointment, if you want a scary movie, watch something else! How many times will Micheal Myers get killed?. Theres bound to be a halloween (H21) 'the return of the rest of Micheal Myers' (You'll only get that joke if you saw it but don't, watch Scream that is the best film"
1,Here we go yet again.,"The utterly stupid title (is it supposed to be funny?) sets the scene. Endless padding, nothing really fresh or exciting. All-in-all a pointless waste of time and money which doesn't even deserve one star."
1,The movie was not all of that.,I expected a little bit more from the movie as far as being scary. I didn't like it. It was corny.
1,Not up to par with the previous releases,Well i may be a big fan of the halloween saga...but this one was lacking compared to the rest. The one thing that can never be replaced is the vital role of Dr. Loomis and you can tell the difference his abscense left. There were alot of questions left unanswered from part 6 and H20 left them that way. I guess anticipation got the best of me because i expected too much. As for the rest of the Michael Myers' fans...do not worry the saga will continue...and i can't wait for part 8.
2,Better stick with the others!,"H20,a bad movie.Lets face it H20 is nowhere as good as the first and it had major problems.First of all H20 tried to forget films 3-6 which (excluding three) were good movies.Also this movie needed Dr. Loomis which he was allways was a real good thing in the othe movies.And most of the scares weren't done by the best killer ever Michael Myers.The Halloween theme was changed and I didn't think it was as good.The ending I didn't like because it made me think will there be another Halloween film.Like Brad from Pittsburg said that ""True terror never dies"" I just hope he is right"
3,Michael Myers shall live,"I thought this movie was Ok. I didn't like the fact that it disregarded Halloween 4-6. I think there will be a Halloween 8, because true evil never dies. Michael will live forever."
4,Collectables,"This is the real Halloween 3. The sad thing for the series is Halloween 3. I DID NOT LIKE the fact Michael was not in the movie, still its not a bad film on its own, I DID LIKE H 20, it answered a lot of qestions regarding the family tree, although im still confused if Jamie had a daughter or son. The spooky atmosphere makes these films. My favourite movies are pts 1-5. Pt 1 - 3 brings me back to my youth and the DVD transfers are fine, if you are after something intelligent, this is not for you, for the films are a fun and entertaining session of good-looking horny teens getting slashed. Not great but what the hell its all popcorn stuff anyway. If anyone is interested in Halloween collectables, email taylor5821@hotmail.com"
4,"""Good Halloween Sequel!""","Jamie Lee Curtis and Josh Hartnett star in Steve Miner's1998 horror sequel. After 20 years, Michael Myers findshis sister and her son. I like that Jamie Lee came back,but I wish Donald Pleasence could've been in it too.This dvd has good picture and sound plus a coupleneat extras. I recommend this good sequel."
3,It Had It's Moments,"H20 is mainly a follow-up on the Laurie Strode character and while the that story was handled well the film suffers from the lack of Dr. Loomis.H20 was actually my introduction to the Halloween series and probably the reason it took me a while to follow up by seeing the original films. The reason being that the film is a fairly generic mid-90's slasher aside from the brother vs. sister angle. The final fight and aftermath is great, but the other kills (especially the opener) are fairly boring.The Michael Myers character and performance are great, the only problem being that they allowed us to see his eyes and they were far from ""the blackest eyes...the devil's eyes"".Personally, I would have preferred a follow up to Halloween 4 that brought Jamie in contact with Laurie (friendly or otherwise) then Michael appearing to attack them both.But overall, one of the better sequels in the series."
3,Very entertaining!,"I sometimes find myself disliking this film. But I must now say, it is another winner from Steve Miner, who did the classics Friday the 13th Part 2&3 and House. His Warlock was also really cool. Unfortunately his latest flick, Lake Placid was pretty bad, except for some cool gore and funny humor. Anyway, I will say this film didn't have to steer clear completely from the others in the series after Part 2. Because there are a lot of series fans that like 4-6. The filmmakers made the film with a cool pacing. NOTE : The film has a lot of scores from other horror flicks like, Scream, Wes Craven's New Nightmare etc."
3,H20:20 Years Later....Yeah 20 Years And Its Still Boring....,"Ok that was an over-statement,the movie is pretty good but it sort of lacks that horroe-esqe vibe.It could of been a little longer and the ending could of been ALOT better!When my cousin saw this in the theater she said all of the people stared booing at the end.This has it's good and bad moments,It is in my collection{DVD}. You should see it to make you on thoughts.Please do not exept mine,until you see it.It is a high 3."
3,EXCELLENT ending!,"I bought this video RIGHT when it came out. I thought it had to be better than 6 because it had Jamie Lee Curtis from the first two in it. The opening scene was EXCELLENT! When I saw that, I thought I was in for another Scream. I wasn't happy with all the lameness sandwiched in between the beginning and the end, but I was BLOWN AWAY by the EXCELLENT finale! I can't wait to see Part 8. Just kidding."
5,finally a sequel that leaves up to the original ! ! ! !,"This movie is the best sequel of HALLOWEEN,has a great story but forgets a little the previous ones,is super cool that the new generations enjoy an anniversary like this movie,what was made before some of us be born,this is one of my favorite movies The DVD has a very clear image but the only problem is the widescreen Letterbox aspect,we need a widescreen anamorphic edition to enjoy more this great movie,the audio Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround is excellent the sounds are separated excellently. The previous edition of this DVD indicate in the packing an audio comentary that is not including but in the recent edition this mistake doesn't appears. I think that there's a special edition with DTS,but I'm not so sure if this is true.All i can say is: Jamie Lee Curtis makes a triumphal return!!!."
3,michael's back,michael's back in this latest installment. i found this dvd to be very close to the first halloween. very good acting and storyline. my only complaint with this movie is the fact that it completly leaves out the story of halloween 4 - 5 & 6. it picks up after part 2 and makes no metion of the rest of the halloween movies!!! part 8 will no doubt do the very same thing which is due out in march 2002. the truth is this series died afterpart 5. buy this one only if you are a die-hard halloween fan!!!
2,some 80 ones where better,am i the only who who notdid think it was that great. it was boring an slow movie at parts and predictable. there were a few good things about it thou mainly jamie lee curits returning and a pre peral harbor josh harnett. it also had refence to the orignal which was good. the biggest loose was that of donland plesance who played dr. loomis. he brought the series part of its life unfortualy he died a few years before this was made. too bad he would have brought the movie up a star.
2,Not happy with this one!,"This is basically a direct sequel from Halloween 2,leaving out 4,5 and 6,can you believe that?!anyway Lauries life has been ruined by what happened to her,Michael kills Marion Chambers from the first and second and finds Laurie and her son and we got LL Cool J in this who didnt even die!well at the end we thought that Michael was dead cause he got decapitated,but thankfully for Ressurection director of the second fixed that up for us,i remember seeing this movie and i just walked out of the cinema laughing!"
1,Cash Grab For Echo Bridge,"Attention Amazon.com customers....1. Avoid this release like the plague. This Blu-ray Disc only has the movie and nothing else. LITERALLY! No subtitles, no trailer, no anything.2. The picture is subpar for a high-definition transfer. Not to mention, it's not in the original aspect ratio. H20 was filmed in 2.35.1. This version's ratio was changed to 1.78.1.3. The audio is pathetic. You don't even get surround sound. You get a pitiful DTS 2.0 Stereo track. The DVD at least offered us a 5.1 mix. I thought Blu-ray Disc was supposed to be an upgrade from DVD?Save your money and avoid this title. Echo Bridge has a reputation for butchering films and they did themselves justice with this one. Until we as consumers stand up and quit buying this garbage of a release, they will never give us the quality that we deserve. The links below will give you a little more information concerning this release.[...][...]"
1,AVOID THIS RELEASE!,"Echo Bridge's release of Halloween H20 is severly comprimised and should be avoided.First, this release is not in the original aspect ratio. Originally released theatrically at 2.35:1 (per imdb), this Blu-ray includes a cropped 1.78:1 aspect ratioSecond, the only audio option is a DTS-HD 2.0 stereo mix, as opposed to the 5.1 mix included as part of the original dvd release from December 1999! Additionally, there are no subtitle options for the hearing impaired.Lastly, there are no special features whatsoever.So, let's see, no OAR, comprimised audio, no subs, no special features.Remind me again why anyone would by this rush cash grab by Echo Bridge?"
5,Good Sequal,"Good to see Jamie Lee Curtis back in this exciting sequal, even though the years of being stalked by Halloween Boogieman......Michael Myers, had taken its toll . Very exciting clkmax....."
1,It was just like the first one,"This has to be one of the worst Halloween sequels I have ever seen. Why would they have Michael Myers wait 20 years? I mean I think that's a stupid idea (no offense). This movie wasn't that scary, there is only like about two scenes that are scary but the rest of the movie sucks and it's so dumb. I also can't beleive that they are busy making another one and I hope that's the last Halloween movie. But if it is the last Halloween movie please don't make anymore it's getting kind of annoying by the way they are making so many sequels that don't turn out to be good. So if I were you I would stick with the first one don't even bother of renting this movie you'll be disappointed."
1,Glad I had a movie pass. (Didn't have to pay to see it),"Where the hell is Joseph Gordon-Levitt when he is needed. Oh, now I remember, he was bloody killed before the opening credits."
1,In my book this movie gets a TURKEY...,All I have to say is don't waste your money on this cinematic garbage. It was boring and even lame to say the least. And why did they find the need to change the music and his mask? This is deffinately one of THE WORST movies I have EVER seen!
5,GREAT SEQUEL,"Halloween H2O was such a thrill to watch. With all of the releases in the HALLOWEEN franchise, H2O is right up there with Halloween 1 & 2. Jaime Lee Curtis reprises her role as Laurie Strode, 20 yrs later and Michael Myers finds her. This is a great movie that I feel will just get better with time."
3,OKay,The movie was okay itself but the mask of Michael Myers was awful. It looked like something they just put together with out of clay. This movie is still worth a rent.
1,Ok movie sequel but rather poor DVD,"I'm a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis and so I bought this and while the movie was ok for being what it was, a tribute sequel to a successful long-running horror series as well as a tribute to the horror thriller genre (the scene between Jamie and her mother, famous for Pyscho was excellent!)For the cost of the DVD and what it represents, I expected MUCH more in the way of extras. In fact, the box advertises a commentary but doesnt actually have it! I returned my copy because of this and will not buy this movie again unless it's released as a special edition or as part of a box set like the Nightmare on Elm Street movies."
1,wheres the zero star!,"the worst movieI have ever seen ,I really would not recommend this movie to anyone even if they only had half a brain cell. its not scary more of a comedy gone wrong, DANGER KEEP CLEAR!"
3,Okay movie,"It's an okay movie. If you wanted a one line summary you got it. But really, think about it. This movie pretty much stains the names of horror flicks everywhere! And the way they changed his mask... DOWN-RIGHT DISGRACEFUL TO US DEVOTED FANS!! And the whole sex appeal thing? That preety much ruined it for younger veiwers. Jamie, I'm sorry but your movie (NOT MOVIE'S!!)just didn't get me goin' the way the did long ago. No disrespect to the people who liked the movie. There were some good parts. And the ending.. I don't want to give it away...!! HE HAS EVEN BIGGER PROBLEMS THAN I THOUGHT!!! If you like all that teenage, kinky sex thing.. go see this movie. If not go see it anyway. It has it's ups and downs."
4,Laurie is going to take care of Michael once and for all !!!,"Michael returns to the original plot of the Halloween series.But this time the Myers blood in Laurie Strode/Kerry Tate(Jamie Lee Curtis) is going to set her off is much or more than Michael. I can't say the ending,but I can say the movie is in a Suspense format like ""Halloween"" instead of a Horror format like 2 through 6.This movie definitely lives up to its predecessor from 1978. But the good thing about this film is you only have to see ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II"" toknow the basic entire story of Michael Myers."
5,A TRUE RETURN TO HORROR,"Probably one of the best horror films to come out in years. It doesn't totally rely on gore/slash or the hot young stars of today. Jamie Lee Curtis is great as usual. Although short, it gets right to the point and doesn't keep you yawning or hanging on. This movie is destined to become one of the horror classics."
1,Halloween H2O Twenty Years Later,"WHAT A RIPOFF!!!!!!!!! We just got this movie in the mail today, sat down to find out that it is a cropped 1.78 version instead of the original 2.35 one that we have in regular DVD. The sound is inferior 2.0 Stereo...in these days of everything being in 5.1 or 7.1 surround sound. Obviously the people at Echo Bridge Entertainment are a bunch of greed-heads who are in it to RIP YOU OFF!! Don't waste your time and especially your money buying this piece of CRAP!!!"
4,Laurie vs Mike III,"I found this movie to be more of a novelty item to the original's greatness. I think Steve Miner could have used more gore (i.e. F-13 2 & 3) and maybe they should have changed the plot to have Myers on his old stomping grounds. Anyway, it was pretty cool, LL Cool J as fun laughing at, but why didn't Michael choke his annoying a@@ like he did to the guy in Part I? Maybe then I would give this five stars. H20 just makes the original look even better."
2,It's all wet,"Michael Myers is back once again without an explaination (only signature of DIMENSION) and after 20 years of searching, he's found his sister. He then proceeds to the private school in California where she teaches and hacks up a few of her students before going after her. Starts off lame with Curtis dropping a bomb on the project and doesn't get good until the near end, where Curtis begins to improve. Pretty much just another teeny bopper film of the late '90's that wins over part 6 but not by a noticable lot. If you don't know who the secretary is before watching the behind the scenes specials, it's better that you retire from the HALLOWEEN fanclub."
5,Halloween H20,"Jamie Lee Curtis is the all time horror film actress. What I didn't like is her change of identity from Laurie Strode to Keri Tate. I know she was terrified of her crazy brother Michael, but it's not worth changing her identity. I rate it 5 stars, but the movie is WAY TOO SHORT!"
3,Not a very scary halloween night,In my opinion this flick was a total letdown considering that the movie stars one the greatest killers of all time and also one of the hottest babes of all time but neither of them deliver the merchandise.It's still a pretty good flick with some good scenes but it could have been so much better.
2,not as good as critics say it is,"This was a OK movie.I thought it was cool to have Curtis back but this movie kinda stunk.For example,this movie isn't scary and it's too short.""Jason Goes To Hell"" was scarier than H20.Also why did they say in the start of the movie(when the 2 copswere talking after the lady died)""They never found Myer's body"" to make it sound like parts 4-6 never happened? This Halloween is really for the people who don't watch the other Halloween's.If your a true Halloween fan, skip H20, if your a person who didn't watch the other moviesand gets scaried easily, go on ahead and this weak Halloween movie."
2,Yet Another Halloween Movie,"Well, when I first saw this movie, I was assuming it was picking up where the sixth one left off. That made little sense to me. Why would Laurie Strode fake her death and leave behind her little daughter as prey for her crazy brother? Kinda selfish, to say the least. Then I understood what ""20 years later"" implied. When watching this movie, you have to pretend that everything after the sequel doesn't exist.Laurie Strode is living somewhere else now with her teen son. She assumes that her dear brother Michael has no idea where she is. Fool! Michael knows everything.Lots of blood and carnage follow.This movie is OK as a horror genre flick. I liked it better than the sixth one."
3,What matters to you?,"Im on the fence regarding this release. Yes it has better picture quality than the dvd however as previously reported the aspect ratio is off. The good news is that you dont lose any picture, you actually gain picture. The bad news is that the extra picture is really not what the director wanted. Its not the travesty that everybody is making it out to be but it is annoying if you care about the directors vision. BTW I took a star off my rating for the cover alone. Why they just didn't use the original cover art is beyond me/"
2,"If Jamie Lee isn't afraid of Michael, Why should the audience be?","The last 20 minutes of this movie are of Jamie Lee Curtis stalking Michael Meyers and not the other way around.If that seems like a scary premise to you then you don't ask for much.This deflates the threat of the masked killer and leaves you with nothing but Jamie Lee doing an action hero impression.""Scary"",yes,but not in the way I want a Halloween movie to be.Stick with the first two movies.Halloween 4 was ok too."
4,EXCELLENT!,"Rip-roaring sequel to an appaling predecessor. In this film we see the return of Jamie Lee Curtis. Now headmistress in a new school, Jamie has changed her name in the hope that her psychotic brother will never find her. Introducing Josh Harnett as Jamie Lee's son and a load of cheeky humour from Scream Producer Kevin S. Williamson. This film is also less violent, which is a plus. But of the violent scenes prepare to turn your stomach this is quite gruesome in parts. Excellent film: 1 flaw- what happened to storylines of Halloween 3-6? Secondly, producers don't create that sequel you are planning to create- Halloween 2000....you are on a high now and end it like that"
1,"Halloween H2O, last was one of the worst","I went to the theatre expecting to see a great scary sequel to all the halloween movies. When I saw the movie, I had all the emotions about it that I didn't want to have. It was boring, no where near scary, and what is up with it being so short. The only thing that I liked about this movie was Jamie Lee Curtis's attitude. She finally quits running away and faces her problem. I have seen all the other Halloween movies but this was the 2nd to worst one (Halloween 3 being the worst). But, contrary to my review, I do recomend seeing it, but only so you can see how the series ends, but if this is your first halloween, try to pick a different one."
1,THE WORST HORROR MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!,"YUCH!What an awful movie.This doesn't deserve to be in the same category of Nightmare on Elm Street,or even a part of this series.If I could I would give this movie a zero,even a negative.I have seen hundreds of horror movies since I was a boy, but this is slasher movies at its worst.It had no good point,and the directing was awful too.Not enough killing,and flat out boring.Not worth a penny of my money.Not scary at all.Steer clear of this stinker."
4,A Surprise!,"""Halloween H20"" is the best since the first two films from the late 70's and early 80's. I was not expecting the genuine suspense that this 7th sequel provides. This one kind of dismisses part 3-6 as if they were never made. For many that may not be a bad thing. Out of the two latest installments like this film and ""Halloween Resurrection""..""H20"" is much superior! ""Resurrection"" is a joke! Jamie Lee Curtis dies in a stupid way and the story they came up with is laughable. You'll have to see for yourself on that one. With ""H20"" keeping with the spirit of the original 1978 classic, you can't go wrong with this ""20 years later"" anniversary film."
3,"A ""Halloween"" to Remember","Twenty years after the first ""Halloween,"" Michael Myers is back and better than ever! Well, not really, he's just back. Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is now a headmistress of a California private school and she's having psychological problems. Her brother is in her nightmares and he's come back to pay his dear sister a visit. Those silly children should've gone to Yosemite. LL Cool J plays a security guard who cusses and writes poetry! Melodious! Why does the boyfriend always act tough in these kinds of movies, but never survives? This movie is a good sequel."
3,Twenty years Later.,"This one besides the first two is the best of them all. Not because of the story or acting, because of how scary it is and how great the ending is. This one is well worth buying, The story takes place in California at a school where Jaime lee curtis is the head mistress. She faked her death to get away from her brother Michael and now has a 17 year old son named John. But somehow Michael finds away to get to her and starts trying to kill John. Laurie now knows to face her brother in this one.This one is truly a thrill ride from start to finish with a great ending."
2,Did we really need this?,"How many sequels can you take? As if the previous four weren't bad enough, (we'll go ahead and throw the third in there too.) now this. Unless I am mistaken, the original premise of Halloween was that evil can never really be truly eliminated. Obviously since then we've discovered that all you really have to do is crash an ambulance. Plus, gore is not suspense people!"
2,"""he's not dead dammi*""",20 years ago Michael meyers stalked his sister laurie strode and tryed to kill her. After he failed he ramaged against his other family members to get to her and to fufill his destination. In h20 Michael finally finds his sister and stalks her again. This movie sucks it has the teen 90's horror movie feel (like dumb a$$ scream). Michael should be alive and back on his rampage. Donnot waste your money seeing this movie. The only reason we(my cousin and I) give this a two is because it brought you back to the fight between Laurie and Michael If that really was Michael.
5,This movie rocked.,Jamie Lee does make a triumphant return! The best of all of the Halloween sequel which pays homage to the original.
3,Is this game right for you?,"Face it. The graphics in this game stink. Only at a certain elevation will the ground NOT look a bunch of multi-colored squares. Even at this point the ground looks flat and the buildings do not stick out- they are 2-D. Only skyscrapers stick out- they are visible from all levels because they are 3-demsional. There is a limited variety of planes- just 6- but you will easily grow to like some. Cockpit is easy to control and you can fly to onlyy 300 airports. There are plenty of sites to see though. There are challenges that you can play were you are put to the test. Some are wild stunts, and others are finding your way around in bad conditions or landing on an aircraft carrier. This game also includes a flight school were you can learn to maneuver with great skill to the greatest level. This game is great to get started on, but you may find yourself wanting to upgrade to a better version."
4,"Excellent for Beginners, Not as good for experts","This program is excellent for beginners, but experts may not like it as much as FS2000. I assume there is no manuals with it, so reading learners may not like it. The best thing about this game is it is expandable(e.g. New aircraft, scenery) e-mail me if you want to know how to expand it!"
5,An Uplifting Album,"Another one of Commissioned's masterpieces. My husband and I love this CD, and are usually fighting over who gets to listen to it. My husband's favorite song is ""I'm Learning"". One of my favorite songs (and I have a whole lot of them) is ""We Shall Behold Him"". Of Course it talks about the Rapture, and meeting the Saviour in the air. I am anticipating for His return! Just to see Him face to face would be so awesome!!"
4,Hot Stuff....,"This is a great collection of music by Bow Wow Wow. A Malcolm Mclaren creation...Adam Ant's original band with a jailbait female singer....the band put out some really great music. This CD includes ""Sex"", W.O.R.K., Louis Quatorze, Uomo Sex Al Apache and their masterpiece ""C30, C60, C90, Go"" in english and in spanish. Originally a cassette-only release (back in the days before cds) it was called Girl Bites Dog Your Cassette Tape Pet."
3,You might already have taped this.,"There's Obama-mania out there. If you want to sell a cup of lemonade, write Obama on the cup. So ABC wants to make money off their inauguration day coverage. This is just what they showed that day put on DVD.Don't get me wrong: I'm proud to have been in DC on that day. But if you already saw Aretha's hat or Yo-Yo Ma's string-synching, then this is nothing new. They show Warren's prayer without speaking of his bias to the rainbow children. This felt like watching the coverage of a Thanksgiving day parade.Still, you may want this for posterity. Your unborn children and grandchildren may grow by seeing this. The special features section is significant as it shows election night and Obama's entry into the race, etc. Also, like many, Obama's candidacy was just as important because of Michelle as it was for him. She is here in healthy amounts and seeing the first African-American First Lady is what makes this era so special to me, even as a brotha."
1,the inauguration of barack obama;a moment in history,please check this product properly the volume is having a problem i return the first one you send to me because of volume problem and the second one is also the same
4,Nice historical keepsake,"Buy a little history today. It is through the eyes and commentary of ABC, so if you watch another news organization you may a well buy that version. It does do a nice compressed view of the days events. There are older interviews of the Obamas before the election which are nice to watch."
4,President Barack Obama DVD,"We purchased this DVD as a gift, but understad from the recepient that it captures the Innuaguaration events very nicely."
2,Disappointed,"The quality is not at all what I expected. Also, the DVD was one of two I received which were loose and not secure (free from scratching) in its case."
2,More alphabets than invitations,"This book was certainly not what I expected. I'm always on the lookout for new ideas and creative invitation samples. This book fell short of my expectations because it had very few actual pieces featured. If you are looking for a beginner's calligraphy manual, and have lots of time to spend on your wedding placecards, this book would be a great resource for you. Unfortunately, I didn't find the inspiration I was looking for."
2,Best used as a caligraphy manual,"This book consists of different types of caligraphy fonts and how to place the lines on the invitations, but it gives very few picutres of finished invitations. It doesn't give creative ideas on how the invitations should look beyond how to do the caligraphy. If you want to use caligraphy to address your invitaitons yourself then this might be usfeul to you. Otherwise, look to other places for creative ideas on styling your wedding invitations, announcements, placecards, and more."
2,"Where's the ""and more""?","I recently purchased this item thinking I could get some great ideas for wedding stationery. I found that this book is strictly a calligraphy instruction manual. The title does not really reflect the contents of the book. If you are looking to learn calligraphy I will assume this book may be of great use to you. But if you are looking for some creative ideas for stationery this is not the book for you. There is no ""and more"" just calligraphy styles."
2,A big disappointment,"I loved ""Chronometree"" and had high expectations for this album. In short, they were not met. The music is dull and seems slaved to/constrained by a completely unoriginal narrative that runs through the album. The lyrics strike me as embarassingly over-sentimental. I think the word I'm looking for is ""schmalzty""?But then again, I never could get into the whole ""rock opera"" genre - if that's what this is attempting to be."
2,Hardly complete,"The vagueness and inconsistancy with the finer points of raising ACD's can create some real problems for those who don't realize the intelligence of this breed. Also, the history of this breed, according to this book, will lead you down the road of half truths and myths regarding the true origin of the Australian Cattle Dog. I would suggest Scott Lithgow's book, Training and Working Dogs even if a companion to this breed doesn't wish to work their dog. It has valuable information on raising this particular breed and others like them. For true history of this breed, I would suggest A Dog Called Blue by Noreen Clark."
5,The Complete Australian Cattle Dog,Wonderful book. Very easy to understand. Sound information. Very helpful hints for raising an ACD. Highly recommended.
2,not what I was looking for,"I think for a breeder or trainer, they might find this book helpful, for the lay dog owner..not really what I was looking for."
4,so so,"Not terribly useful.........I thought it would be more of an Owner's Manual and I'd like to see more specifications, links, you know, questions like ""How long do they live?"" ""Average weight?"" ""When do they stop growing?"" ""Do they ever grow up?"""
4,Good video,It's a good video and seems to work if you practice the tips presented. Give it to a friend when you're done!
4,Not as bad as the AVGN said,"This game is not all bad. Some parts are iffy, but over all it is faithful to the series it was based on. It not a very graceful game, like Castlevania...which was made by Konami...like this game (Ultra is a subsidiary of Konami created to facilitate getting around Nintendo's draconian licensing rules, namely the 5 games a year.) If you like Star Trek, you would like this game."
3,VERY FUN GAME!!,"I have played this game before back when it had just been released. I bought this copy because I had lost my old one. This carridge has obviously seen better days, though. The game works but only occasionally and intermittently."
5,CRIKEY WHAT A GOOD DVD,"Steve Irwin, a universal wildlife warrior, will deeply be missed. This dvd covers every aspect of his life, only an hour long but its well worth the purchase!I would also recommend the tribute dvd"
5,excellent book,"i have been breeding saints for several years now, and this is a very good resource book...some of the information is not practical(like make him tripe to eat); but you are able to infer and obtain basic information....saint bernards are the most loveable dogs in the world, if possible everyone should have one!!"
4,Good Stuff but with Misleading Product Name,"The picture quality and sound quality are more than satifying to me. However, I believe that it does NOT have the capability to receive digital broadcasting, which means you can NOT use it to watch HDTV from the airway.The only TV tuner I know that has the capability to receive digital broadcasting is Hauppauge's WinTV-HD and its cousins."
5,Living Legends- They are what they are!,"Yo, this disc is on point. Every track is sumthin nice...no fillers on this one. The phat beats keep your head boppin, and the lyrics are RAW as sushi! Check out the tracks..Gotta Question For Ya, Nightprowler f/ Slug, Common Ground, Nothing Less, Soap Boxin. I Gotta Give it up for keepin it Underground..F**k commercial Radio!! Another HIPHOP CLASSIK, What more can I say? They are Living Legends!"
4,The genious and mastery of Eric Dolphy,"Although there is very little footage of Eric Dolphy (ED) in this informative documentry,the film still manages to capture the essence of this beautiful brother. It seems that ED knew what he wanted to do at a early age. His level of commitment is truely endearing, as this is conveyed through interviews (early in the film) with relatives, music instructors, and acquaintences. ED could have given up his pursuits of a musical quest because as teenage he had applied to play with the L.A.Symphony, but was turned down do his ""color"". Fortunately for us ED persevere, and continued pursuits musical creativety. This a beautiful film about a beautiful individual. Truely one of the great jazz gaints, whose career was cut to short in part by a miss diagnosis hypoglycemia."
5,Magical Book about True Divine Love,"This book is a Magical Book about True Divine Love.I could literally NOT put it down. I was filled with such love and joy andso many other emotions reading this book about true love and the magicof it when we come from Divine Love.I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who is a lover of life, God and each other.Tianna and Williams mystical love story will inspire everyone to follow their heart."
4,Sophisticated Mystery,"This novel gets off to a suspenseful start. It is beautifully, thoughtfully and cleverly written--no question. However, you need to pay attention or you might get lost along the way. Characters are at times reintroduced with no reminder as to who they are. You might get the Bakers and Palmers in the story confused, or just have forgotten who they are. The denouement was quite intricate and threatened to give me a headache, I was trying so hard to follow the thread and make sure I had picked up on everything. And, finally, the propensity of young girls to fall for middle-aged men in this book is amusing (a wishful-thinking trait endemic to many male written mysteries). These are the only reasons I did not give LAST BUS TO WOODSTOCK five stars; it is just this side of brilliant, and Colin Dexter's depiction of Sergeant Lewis, in particular, is truly masterful."
3,Disappointing,"I am a particular fan of British mystery/procedurals and have read and re-read Dorothy Sayers, P.D.James, Deboria Crombie, Peter Robinson and Charles Todd with unabated delight, but after plodding through the first three of the Morse books I have struck Colin Dexter from my list. I had not watched the Inspector Morse series on TV, had no preconceived ideas about the characters or the format, and relied only on the enthusiasm expressed by other readers. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I found the characters unappealing and the plots flat and tedious."
2,Disappointing,"I had high expectations to this book; with so well reviews from people I really looked forward to it. Now, I'm not saying it's bad, no, but not all that it's cracked up to be! It's nothing to do with Morse's diversions from the TV-series, it's just the plot, the characters; it's all rather mediocre. Maybe my expectations were too high...? No, if you want to read Dexter, read Service of all the dead!"
1,Read Another Book In The Series,"I started reading the Inspector Morse novels with Dexter's later works. I don't normally do that, and so decided to go back and start at the beginning. I wholly regret doing so as it's nearly ruined the series for me. Although I am not a militant feminist by any means, I felt that the repeated ""jokes"" about sexual assault were offensive and in terribly poor taste. The characters are cardboard cut-outs, the mystery is touch-and-go, and, IMHO, the ending doesn't work well at all. My advice is to skip this book and move on to others in the series."
1,Just to make money,"This book is a badly written summation of his other books, into which he has woven some moral sermonising to promote his humanitarian work. This is not of itself necessarily a bad thing but I didn't buy the book for that reason. So it was a big disappointment to me personally."
2,Not So Happi Tummi,Bought Happi Tummi with the hope of some relief to our 4 week old's colic symptoms. Didn't seem to do anything except spread a pleasant chamomile scent
2,Does not taste very good,the cost of this cocoa is about $4 per cupand I does not taste very good.You only get 12 small 1 cup servings.it tastes just like any other cheap cocoa.I will not buy this again....
5,Amazing Film!!!,I can't believe I just watched this film for the first time. I honestly can't say why I've never seen it. It is one of the most powerful stories ever rendered to film. It's relevance to Iraq and the Arab/Isreali conflict is actually quite spooky. I've seen few films that deliver the political and emotional left hook that this does. You must see it - you will be transformed!
5,Entertaining & Educational,Fabulous historically accurate fictional movie (almost documentary). Gripping. A must see in all mature French and History classes. Arrived as promised.
3,Important But...,"I will never watch it again. A bold documentary style recreates events so well it feels at times you are watching the real thing. However, it lacks personal touches of what it felt like to be a French soldier fighting an immoral war, an underground muslim bomber struggling for independence, or a civilian of either nationality trapped in the middle."
5,An astonishing document,"There is no other film that stands remotely near ""The Battle of Algiers"" as a reference point at this time when we are commencing a ""war against terrorism"". Such a war is the subject of this film. It can only be compared with ""The Triumph of the Will"" as a masterpiece of political propaganda. In the twenty-five years since its first release, ""...Algiers"" has probably inspired more specific acts of violence than any other film ever made. It has been an indispensable document for students of the Third World from then until now, and now is more pertinent to us all than ever before. As an extra bonus, it has music by Ennio Morricone. Be warned, though; it is a cautionary tale for us, as it has always been."
5,Where is the DVD of this film?,One of the great films of all time--why is it not on DVD? With commentary? My father was stationed in Algeria during WWII and saw the utter contempt with which the French treated the Algerians--worse he said than racism in America a hundred fold. To understand the tragedy of Algeria today one must understand the great heroism of the Algerian people in the 50's and 60's.
5,Brilliant and compelling work on a difficult subject,"Just for the record, the synopsis is incorrect in one area. There is no, repeat, NO, ""real life"" footage in the film. The fact that so many believe that actual documentary film was used in the film is a testament to its realism and power."
3,The Battle of Algiers (1966) - Gillo Pontecorvo,"The Battle of Algiers is a mixed bag of both cinematic venture, and amateur acting. Director Gillo Pontecorvo's choice of using mostly non-professional actors was both a blessing and a curse. The unfamiliar faces helped create more of a ""realistic feel"" the film is known for, but many times the acting is laughable, taking the viewer out of the film entirely. The film's best quality is the nice location shooting, and it's universal belief of the powers of revolution. Unfortunately the quasi-documentary style never sustains itself throughout the film and it becomes a rather unrealized picture of political cinema. The Battle of Algiers is noteworthy because it attemped more than the usual ""Hollywood"" artifact."
4,Movie Review,I can say this movie was just as expected. I can say this movie also has a history. The Pentagon had shown this in 2003 to get an view of what warfare is like in the 20th century. Also it was used by groups both right and left and is one in which lots of students in Political science classes and beyond have studied and why I recommend it. Some of the footage even went into other documentaries.
4,Great black & white cinema,"Excellent historical narrative of the French colonial desire to control North Africa for the ""Motherland""It is somewhat symbolic of what apartheid did to South Africa"
1,Battle of Algiers,"One of the best movies ever produced in Algeria. I would like to have it in my library, in fact I will buy it."
5,Truth translated thru film....,"This is an extraordinary, great film and a ""must see"". I first saw it in U.S. theaters as a youth in the 1960's when it was first released here, and then sought it out again to gain another perspective (than that offered by the pathetic U.S. media) on current global events and the seeming widespread misunderstanding of terrorism in the world today. This film presents a graphic, fair, and thought provoking depiction of what people are driven to under extreme circumstances. The truth in this film is clearly applicable to situations around the globe today. See it.....and check your own truth."
3,In sore need of an editor,"Don Quixote is a touching, often funny, often sad novel. Since everybody knows what the book is about more or less I won't spend my time on it. However I do feel that this book could have used a lot of editing. The story diverges from the main plot (which is not really coherent) quite often by telling totally irrelevant tales. One such tale makes up about 250 pages of the book, and is totally unrelated to Don Quixote's travels. I know it was meant to serve (at its time) as a parody of such knightly tales, but this parody has lost all of its relevance today. I would personally recommend skipping those parts entirely (gasp!). Had it not been for them I would easily given this book 4 stars, probably 5."
3,Abridgment,"Just a head's up for people. This book is an abridged version of Don Quixote. It says so on the title page, which unfortunately the publisher doesn't allow Amazon readers to see (at least at the time of my review).It's a shame, too, because it is a nice edition at a more than reasonable price (currently $7.49): it is a hardback edition with a sturdy spine and binding; the pages are thick; and the font is clear. Overall, in my opinion, it's an aesthetically pleasing book.I did check the publisher's website before purchasing Don Quixote to see if I could obtain certain information (e.g. translator), but at the time when I checked, I couldn't find such information anywhere.I hope Ann Arbor Media Group will consider placing this sort of information on their website and/or online catalog one day."
4,Adventure Bound,"I was afraid that I might give up in the middle of the book- which I hate to do. There are so many versions and translations of this work, but having finished the book, I'd say that Putnam's translation is among the best.A man who thinks he's a knight traveling all over the country with his squire; his misfortunes are strange, often hilarious. Some parts of this knights adventures seem repetitious. Sometimes I found it hard to read 20 pgs at a time, but reading about Cervantes' characters it's difficult to not grow close to them. Really...where can you possibly find such a true and brave knight who will battle windmills- everything - to prove himself worthy of his Dulcinea?"
4,Don Quixote De La,"Some speak of the book as being about doging good and helping the weak, but the book goes much deeper. It is really asking is this all there really is to life. Is it possible that people are happy with just sleeping and eating or do they seek adventure. Are they satified with looking at the mountian - or should they venture to the other side. Seek adventure and the slain giant shall be your reward."
4,Very Good. Not Great but Very Very Good,"For any one that has heard the story of the windmills and thought ""Sounds funny but stupid,"" BUY THIS BOOK. The story of the windmills is not at all funny compared to Cervantes' subtle humor and satire masterfully woven throughout this book. If you think the book is a bit long after the first part (I was beginging to think so), READ ON. Part two is much better than Part One. Cervantes is never-suffiently-to-be-praised!"
5,Phenomenal,"The tale of Alonzo Quixana, or as he calls himself, Don Quixote, and his partner, Sancho Panza, is one of the greatest works of satirical literature I have ever read. Making fun of religion, chivalry, and more, this book is not one to be forgotten over the ages!"
4,a truly enjoyable read,"I didnt think I would enjoy this...and was proved totally wrong. Although it's set in 16th century Spain, the humor remains vivid and I laughed out loud at many of the incidents. Footnotes throughout clarify the many references to Quixote's much-loved romances. Very readable- but I felt it was long enough!!"
5,Our True Spirit,"Don Quixote is a true classic. A comical and entertaining story about acting out our inner most passions, constrained by the time we live in, with respect to the past and ourselves. The book exemplifies man's evolution onto the next century, with ""Hamlet"", ""Faust"" and ""Quixote"" telling our tale...a must read."
4,Don Quijote in a nutshell,I bought this book for my 7 year-old grandson. It's very easy to read and understand and contains most of the highlights of the story of Don Quijote.
1,very bad book,"very boring abou the squire, i encourage everybody to no read this boring book, althogh it was pretty amazing"
2,autodidactic weaknesses,This book is not entirely suitable for people who want to study on their own.There are no answers provided for the exercises so there is no way of checkingwhether they are right or wrong.
1,What was I thinking?,"I purchased this ""kit"" yesterday and was very dissapointed with it. Upon close inspection of the beads furnished with the kit I noticed that the ""carnelian"" beads, that the book leads you to believe are truely carnelian, are actually made of plastic. (You can tell by looking inside the drilled hole in the bead...it is white inside. True carnelian would be a uniform color inside and out.) I'm not really sure what the ""tiger's eye"" beads are made of. I'm sure they are some sort of synthetic fiber optic material. Also upon inspection of the drilled hole on the ""sandalwood"" beads i noticed that the outside of the bead has been stained to obtain its ""natural color"". How dissapointing! I'm guessing the makers of this kit didn't really care about the true nature of the religion the stamped on the outside of the box, but instead were thinking about capitalism!"
2,Two stars is being generous!,"This book is full of pretty pictures, but that's about it. It lacks any sort of indepth knowledge or teachings about the subject of prayer beads....I would save my money or purchase the book, ""Beads of Faith"" by Gray Henry and Sussnah Marriot!I don't recommend this book to anyone unless you really want it! It's a total waste of money.....borrow a copy from your local library!"
1,Misled by item.,"The book was extremely small and just a paperback. It didnt come with any beads as it should have, as this was the idea of purchasing the book, to use the beads to make a bracelet etc. Therefore the book is quite useless unless one can purchase beads elsewhere. I am very disappointed as, I was under the impression that the book came as a fixed unit ie beads, threadplus anything else to make, and the book enclosed to show how as for sale on other sites for the same amount of money . Not the book sent on its own and the buyer left with not being able to use the information to make anything."
1,I think that last review was a plant,"The writer of the last review did not say anything special about the kit and still managed to give it a top-notch rating. I presume he had read some of the other comments and yet had no response to their detailed and specific criticism.Could it be that a certain book seller gets someone to check out low-scoring reviews and plants a 5-star review to ""improve"" the average on display?I sure hope not because that would be DISHONEST AND WRONG."
4,Enjoyable Little Book / Kit Combo,"Considering you can buy Malas from to...this is a worthwhile kit with book. You make 3 very nice Malas out of carnelian, tiger's eye, and sandalwood. Amazon's price is excellent (I purchased this for tax from a local bookstore). I think it's a nice gift idea. <BRI'm inspired to make more (fun and easy to make)!"
1,Puzzling,My mother is a Dakota speaker and she doesn't recognize many of the words in this dictionary. Many of the words are probably old and no longer used but as I read in the New Lakota Dictionary many words in this dictionary are incorrect. TheNew Lakota Dictionaryincludes words from the Dakota dialects and my mother recognizes most of those.
2,A depressing disappointment,"I had to force myself to finish this book. Just as I was going to put it down, ""something big"" happened, and I thought the story would pick up and things would be resolved. WRONG! I agree that none of the characters were likeable. In fact, they were all pretty mean people. So many things were left undone. I have no idea what happened to these characters and at the end, I didn't care."
2,felt riped off,"Yes I got these. They took forever! and then I got them in a big box and when I opened it, it was a teeny tiny little thing. After paying to much for shipping. I felt very ripped off. It does say how many are in there and I did pay the shipping because at the time I could not find any here where I live (In Japan) Usually things I order get here fast but not this. I wont buy anything uless it is bigger or in bulk to make it worth the shipping. I will also just plan on it taking longer then normal. I am not saying I wont buy from them again, because I may if I need something, and feel I can make it work it. Its more my fault then the companys for not thinking it all through."
1,Does not work,"This peeler does not work. Once one applies enough pressure to get it to peel anything, it digs into the veggie and takes 1/3 off. This may have only cost $2.00, but it has one function. It fails."
1,First and Last Good Cook Purchase,One star is being VERY generous. I paid $4 for this and it's worth nothing. Good Cook should be trying to bring customers in by offering refunds for these worthless peelers but I saw they have discounted them to $1.81 on their website. I guess they don't mind alienating a bunch more potential customers. Here's a great mental note for everyone.... If you see a Good Cook product on the shelf.... LEAVE IT THERE!
2,Blunt after a couple of weeks,"As a corer, you have to puncture through the center of the apple twice to make a complete hole. Then you rotate it before you push the core out. Not very hard to do as the tip of the peeler is pointed.As a peeler, it was good the first time I used it. After a couple of weeks, the blade becomes blunt. now it is too cumbersome to use, you need extra effort, and you need to position the apple perfectly to make a peel.The good thing about it is that no matter if you are right-handed or left-handed, it will work for you. It has two blades on each side."
1,Lousiest peeler I've ever had,"For me, the key to a good peeler is one that ejects the peel as you peel. The design of this one is such that it slices under the skin, goes right through, and when you're done with the stroke, the peel is still in place on the vegetable, and you have to pull it off since the moisture holds it in place. Also, the peels sometimes stick in the peeler as well, so what used to be, with better peelers, a simple task, becomes much more work with this one. Finally got fed up with it this morning, and am searching Amazon for a better replacement."
3,A real ghost!,A sad ghost is trying to scare the twins as they visit theri aunt in an old mansion.But the twins and their cousins may be the only ones who can help him.
4,This is a very good HORROR!,This is one of the best horror books in the SVH editions. I have read alot of SVH items and this is one of the best Horrors!
5,Hungry dragonflies in search of mosquitoes,These men brought the fight to the communists. They fought smart and hard and outguerrlla the guerrilla. There is action from the beginning of the book to the very end. Doc Donahue writes a descriptive and detailed account of his experience in the jungles of Vietnam fighting with a Special Forces led indigenous Cambodian fighting force. It is amazing the hurt they put on the Viet Cong and sad when many of these brave fighters gave their lives often fighting a superior force. I also enjoyed the story of Donahue's adventure of getting supplies in Saigon. An unconventional fighter making an unconventional acquistion of supplies through unconventional means. I plan on reading all the other Donahue books.
2,Just okay,"I know this is a first hand narrative and it's all authentic, but I found this rather boring for some reason. I know everyone will say I'm crazy because of all the positive reviews, but it was tough for me to get through this book. I would recommend it to read for free from the library but I wouldn't recommend buying it. Hope this helps."
5,What audacity!,A beautiful testimony to the courage of these elite soldiers whose mission was to serve as bait for enemy forces far greater in number. Blackjack-33 is the code name of such a perilous mission.
5,spellbinding few days,"Spellbinding is an often overused word but it immediately popped into my mind as I started writing this review. There are few books that ""I could not lay down"" (another cliche') but this one was very hard to lay down, keeping me up late at night. I highly recommend this book. There are a few places where the author seems to have cut and pasted the same description of terrain but this is small criticism compared to the power of the narrative. Few people are aware of the cross-border excursions our troops made, or want to pretend they did not happen, but this book is about the unsung stories and heroes of the ""other war"" that we denied existed."
5,Blackjack 33,"I rate this author a 5 star writer with the most authentic capture of the Vietnam War era. I've read all of his books and continually look for new ones in the future. His account of the actions of the Mobile Guerrilla Forces has illustrated the closeness and personal bonding of individuals regardless of rank, nationality, or race. Each character comes alive as you live each experience with them each day. If you were a real grunt and not a REMF you would understand this bond. I give Donahue 5 Stars!!!"
4,A great book for betterment in business and life,"A great book that's pretty dated now (the author talks of walking around Brentwood, CA with his Walkman and heavy hands), but it's principles are still very relevant. I have highlighted this book all over the place and written in the margins, etc. and I still come back to it time and again to learn more.I liked the story about how he came to be a big PR guy in Hollywood. He's definitely walked the walk, so you really can't go wrong learning success principles from someone like him. Use what works for you and discard the rest, as is the case with anything.Great advice on topics ranging from networking to interviewing (Dress as if I'll fit in with those above me not those below me, be on time, arrive early, keep up with current affairs.), to appearance and selling.His advice to not buy another success book can definitely work but I'm too much of a self-help junkie to heed it. Certainly worth reading and applying wherever and whenever you can."
4,Sick,I frist heard of eyedea & abilities on tony hawks pro skater 4 ( boreing game good soundtrack) i thought big shots was alright so i check out the cd. this cd is SICK it is a must have for any underground rap collecter. 1 of my favorites is on this i stand. tite track.
5,"Hip-hop as you know it, is ever-changing...","""First Born,"" a perfect title for a new style of hip hop that offers intelligence and a new avenue for thought. This cd has some ill tracks on it. Thoughts ranging from dissing MTV to a fish living in a bowl of rocks, mind-expansion is at a premium on this album. Eyedea is well, only the sickest MC out there right now. A voice that is appealing to the listener and flow that is smooth and flawless. This cd, made in 2001 was so ahead of its time that it has the feel of a current release. If you are a fan of Atmosphere, Sole or Alias, you will feel this album to a maximum. If you are new to the hip hop game, you need not look further for the best that hip hop has to offer."
5,SUBSCRIBE:,Phat beats and Ill scratching this cd contains some angery lyrics and sick beats. Kinda reminds me of Atmosphere but with more break-beats. Eyedea and abilities have other disks avalible but I recomend this one (First Born) above all other cds they have released thus far.
3,Generic trance,"This is a good *dance* CD, however I have chosen to give it 3 stars because it is an attempt at Trance/Dance using generic trance tunes. Think of this as Chris Sheppard making a Paul Oakenfold CD, in my opinion most accuretly described as a mix between Chris Sheppard's Groove Station 6 and Paul Oakenfold's Tranceport. On this CD (especially the second disc) one will find that the DJ jumps between dance tracks and trance tracks frequently, giving you energy at times then calming you down on the trance tunes. As mentioned earlier, this is a good dance CD and shows how trance could possibly (with more work though) have a dance influence instead of dream/ambient music."
4,Interesting...,"Jochem has brutally twisted all his sonic textures again, and the result is one of the most interesting releases lately. Industrial-influenced techno and ambien-ish soundscapes with overdriven rhytmic patterns rule here but somehow Mr. Speedy seems to make sense with all this noise.Shocking indeed if you're after bubbling trance-techno like his first album, but if you're into something not quite straight forward, this is the album to get."
3,"Good, but definitely not my favorite album ever","I enjoyed this release but Speedy J has never been the most complex/thoughtful artist in my eyes so I was a bit letdown when I was expecting something along the lines of Gridlock and Autechre only to find a carbon copy of rather than something similar to.It's good music if you enjoy the industrial side of glitch music, but otherwise I wouldn't really recommend it. Chris Clark has done very similar music only improved it significantly; I'd rather stick with him."
1,I want the old speedy j back,"I dont know what all you people who gave this 5 stars are talking about. I wouldnt have even given it one if that were an option. There was a time when speedy j was one of the best IDM artists around. His tracks were uplifting and they would send tingles up and down my spine. This cd however is dark ABRASIVE SONIC GARBAGE. I regret the day i ever bought it. I would suggest buying Ginger instead, Unless of course you enjoy beying irritated, depressed, and paranoid which is how this cd will make you feel."
1,Not acceptable in my opinion,"The cover of the book looked very cute. My son choose the book at the local library. I wish I would have read through more of the storyline before we checked out this book.The reference to a ""stupid person"" was bad enough, but to continue on with: ""People can be good-looking or just ordinary-looking or plain ugly."" in my opinion is not worthy of CWP and was very disappointing as a parent to read this aloud to a four year old."
1,Good facts but...,"It really disappointed me to find the word ""stupid"" in the book. I am aware most of us use that kind of language once in a while but at least I don't expect to find this kind of vocabulary in a book for kids. I believe the word ""silly"" could have been used instead. This is the second time I find this word in a book for kids. Good luck for me they were library books and I just returned them. The other one was ""The Dinosaurs are Back and It's All Your Fault Edward!"" by Wendy Hartmann (Author) and Niki Daly (Illustrator)."
4,history lesson,"An early e.p. (not really a cutout) from Mike Watt's New Alliance label that chronicles a slice of the early California punk scene. Not entirely essential, it still offers some otherwise unreleased greatness with ""Machine"", an anti-worker siren squall from (pre-Henry) Black Flag, and a Minutemen classic (""Clocks""). More obscure punk greatness is here, like the Stains' hard-to-find dirge anthem ""Sick and Crazy"" and many others are either one-off goofiness from scenesters (producer Spot's ""Dildos, Bondage and Toys"") or low-fi creepiness (the nig-heist). A must have for purists who need a peek into punk's golden age."
4,A very good stateside 80s horror anthology,"With an unrecognizable Clu Gulager (but for his voice) . A terrific Vincent Price . Cameron Mitchell turning in good work and so on . Unfortunately , the various women (by and large) are often either underwritten or poorly written . That said , i'm going to get a copy of this fun and scary picture on dvd , after having streamed it . I love anthologies , and this is a pretty darn good one . It took me several weeks to see . Watching it , bit by bit and it still left me quite pleased and gratified . If you are a fan of this sort of film , i'll readily concede that the stories seem not much more than good comic book tales woven together . I like good comic books too . Must like moderate gore in order to enjoy . Here's bobbing at you ."
1,"Good product, does not last","I have had several of the Grill-Per'fect poultry thermometers and they work quite well. (I also have the one for fish.)However, the plastic handle breaks at the point the metal ends. It is not through rough use, rather they are simply weak and need a better design. I will be mailing the one that just broke to manufacturer. I am switching to another device on Amazon that looks to be a better design (Taylor Temp Rite Reusable Thermometers, 5 Styles)."
5,Love Alive 3...Yes Indeed!!!,Plain and simple...The late Bishop Walter Hawkins ALWAYS DELIVERED with each and every release. The set is brilliant and you'll find yourself playing it over and over again....and blessed each time you do. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!
2,Disappointed.,"Love songs wrotten by Walter Hawkins. Have not heard many of these songs, so was disappointed. Songs are also very old."
5,Dazzling,"I have loved Brahms' Scond Piano Concerto ever since I heard it performed by Leon Fleischer under the direction of George Czell and the Cleveland Orchestra. The Czell/Fleischer collaboration on the two Brahms concerti remains for me the hallmark performances of these works. Daniel Barenboim comes a good second to Fleischer. Unfortunately the Cleveland interpretations are not to be had on DVD, and sound reproduction quality has improved over the years. Although thse recordings are not new (1991), the quality is excellent."
4,predestinados para matar,"El autor es meridiano en su critica al Antiguo Testamento, pero cuando toca el Nuevo Testamento su criterio se parcializa por su criterio religioso, evitando tocar temas sensibles respecto al dogma cristiano. Es un libro que nos amplia una nueva perspectiva del mensaje biblico del Antiguo Testamento. Gracias."
4,Good Tool,I bought this saw for remodeling work. It was very efficient at cutting the materials that needed to be removed for the new wood to be placed in over the rotten parts. The only thing I didn't like is that a blade was not included in the kit.
3,Missing features,"""For versatility, the saw's four-position blade clamp allows you to choose the configuration that best matches your application. This unique feature gives you the ability to make flush cuts and put the blade in one of four different directions.""BEWARE: This saw does not have this feature.It's a good saw otherwise but if you want to make easy flush cuts it will not do it.I should have checked the DEWALT site before ordering.AMAZOM was quick to reply to my complaint and took care of me.DEWALT DW310K 12 Amp Heavy-Duty Reciprocating Saw Kit"
3,picture is missleading,I ordered this superwinch 1501b dash mount kit by the picture and you get what is in the package.All you recieve is a wire kit and no switch.
1,i agree picture is wrong...,"Yep,All you get is wiring and dash bracket with this price, I think the price should be with switch."
4,Careful philosophical work on market socialism,"Critics of American-style capitalism have been dogged in recent years by the question: ""What's your alternative?"" David Schweickart has provided the answer.In this book, Schweickart makes an impressive case for ""Economic Democracy"", the name for his preferred version of market socialism. His arguments derive both from moral/political philosophy and from economic theory, with the emphasis on the latter. His command of moral philosophical concepts will not always please professionals in the field, but his economic arguments are impressive.His arguments draw, furthermore, on what empirical evidence there is of the performance of market-socialist economies around the world.A must-read for those seeking an alternative to ""the American model"" -- the internationalization of capital, accelerating corporate consolidation, downsizing of government, dominance of the political process by capital."
3,I disagree but I still recommend this book,"As a libertarian, I found this book challenging, provocative, well-argued and thorough. Of course, as a libertarian, I also found it to be completely wrong about everything, but I would still recommend this book to any libertarian, conservative or free-marketeer who is up for an honest intellectual challenge rather than the parade of straw-man fallacies, circular reasoning and populist rhetoric usually trotted out by the left."
4,"Great Book, shame on Amazon!","I ordered this book explicitly by ISBN to ensure the correct edition, verified the cover matched the covers on all the rest of my Aubrey/Maturin books, and waited with glee. Amazon pulled a bait & switch on me, shipping the wrong edition (they actually did this with one additional book on my 4-book order).The book was great though. Highly recommended.If you want a particular edition, though, get it somewhere else."
2,Surgeon's Mate,"I find all of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey-Maturin stories wonderfully compelling, but the copy of The Surgeon's Mate I received fell flat due to the narration. With Richard Brown as narrator, listening to the story was unpleasant. I recommend Simon Vance's narration exclusively. The name of the narrator is not alway mentioned in the description, but it makes all the difference in listening satisfaction."
4,Great Books-Expensive Shipping,"This was advertised as a used book, but the condition was fine! If I have one complaint it would be the shipping costs. I ordered three books at once and all were delivered in the same USPS envelope. In spite of that, I was charged three different shipping charges."
5,Great starting place!,"I first encountered this book in the library and checked it out so many times that I finally gave in and bought my own copy. I've made gifts using the instructions and patterns in this book, and found that the guidelines and levels of difficulty ratings are dead accurate. I've used this book as a springboard to go further into this craft.One word of advice - I have found origami paper the best suited paper for most of these projects. Regular silhouette paper is hard to come by and expensive. Construction paper is much too thick, hard to cut, and usually not acid-free."
4,GREAT CLASSICS,Any CD that combines the orginal artists with some great hits is a must buy! I am very happy with the great hits on this CD. I love to listen to it while driving with the windows wide open and the sound turned up.
4,a consistent great lineup of songs from the 70's,"Actucally I don't own this cd, but I have listened to everyone of the sounds clips and they sound good. Plus the selection of songs are great. I wish I owned it."
5,Get this book!,"I am now confined for the second time for my Diabetes 2. My doctor decided to confine me for another thorough check after I was rushed on an ambulance when my blood pressure went up to 230/140. I had this book and the Diabetec Cookbook on my shelf for a long while already, but I never had the chance to read it until now. Dr. Rubin made things so simple for me. Everything my doctor used to tell me make sense now. I am sure I will not make the same mistakes again when I get out of the hospital."
5,Great book!,"I've used a lot of the Dummies books, so I was expecting, and got, a great deal. It was even recommended by my diabetes educator and her team! If you are recently diagnosed with diabetes like me, or have a loved one who has diabetes, this is a priceless tool. I highly recommend it!"
3,"Good Information, But Flawed","This review only applies to the Kindle version of the book. It is book which is full of very useful information. However, the Kindle version is deeply flawed.1. There are many tables of information in the book. They are almost useless on the Kindle. The tables come out as screen after screen of columns of numbers. The Kindle conversion was very poorly done.2. Several places in the Kindle version there are whole paragraphs of text formatting instructions. Again, the conversion to Kindle was done sloppily.I plan to buy the print version of the book to be able to use it to control my diabetes. The book has the best information I have seen on how diabetes affects other parts of the body. This is important to me since I already have kidney damage."
3,Okay for a start,"I bought this for my husband, hoping it would give him a basic understanding of his diabetes. It seemed geared more towards Type I which didn't apply to him. Some info, but I found another book that was more applicable."
4,helpful,very helpful reference book for anyone who wants to learn about diabetes for themselves or just in general.
3,"It's a good precurser, but not a complete reference","As a newly dialognosed Type 2 Diabetic, I had a lot of questions. Being familiar with the ""Dummie"" series, I thought this book would answer most, if not all of my questions...but, I have to say that it left me a litte short. The major issue I have with it is that it's kind of all over the place. Most of the information is about Type 1 Diabetes, with information on Type 2 interspersed into the particular topic. It has very little useful info on self-care & alternative options, other than to say that most don't work. I could of did without the recipe section, since there are only a few listed. Aside from all of that, I do know more than I did before I had it. It didn't totally quench my thirst, but it is a first step in what will be a lifetime journey in dealing with this condition."
4,Good book but incomplete,"This book is very basic. I think it deals with the subject topic very well and it addresses the most basic components of the disease. I think another book that also addresses these issues with the exercise component explored in-depth. I would buy both, because a failure to come up with a practical plan for keeping your weight down means that these books are worthless. Suffers of this disease need every advantage, and dealing with the obesity issue is key.The Homeopathic and Diabetic Fitness Bootcamp Book"
3,Dummies are Me,Very informative and I learned things I did not know. Would be a great book for those just starting down the path of learning about Diabetes.
2,Lots of good information - badly organized,"Let the title of this book guide you. I found the book to be frustrating. It is a collection of fragments of helpful hints. There are better organized books available. Originally the book was quite expensive. I'm glad to see they lowered the price. From a publisher that is the ""expert"" on everything from gardening to car repair, you can do better for diabetes management."
1,Should be for Dummies with Phd's,"If this is for ""dummies"" I really must be ignorant. You would need a great deal of medical info to be able to understand this book. I was looking for the bare basics and got bogged down in heavy medical detail."
2,Just Okay,I was looking for information specific to type 2 diabetes this was okay but very general. Not really very helpful.
3,Diabetes for Dummies,"A little information about diabetes, OK for someone just involved with diabetes."
4,Makes it simple,"An ideal overview for newly diagnosed diabetics, not a lot here for someone with experience coping with it. This is the only book I found that also had a Spanish version."
3,Maybe I'm Dumber Than I Thought,"Although most of the books for ""dummies"" are very readable, I found this one to be a bit clinical and geared more toward full-blown diabetes instead of focusing on prediabetes which was what I was looking for.It goes into lots a detail about the causes and effect but I found that after reading ""Prediabetes: What You Need To Know To Keep Diabetes Away"" by Gretchen Becker I really did not need to purchase this dummie book too. If, heaven forbid, the prediabetes turns into the full-blown type the Dummies book would probably be helpful."
5,Very informative,"Being a recently diagnosed diabetic, I didn't know much about diabetes. I had trouble getting my blood glucose numbers and my A1C down to an acceptable level. This book helped me a lot in understanding diabetes and how to live with it. It is well written and easy to understand. It discusses diets, exercise, blood glucose meters, different types of diabetic medications, insulin and much, much more. My blood glucose is now down where it should be, and I just found out my A1C has dropped down to 6.5 (Yeah!). I would highly recommend this book for all new diabetics."
4,Introduction to Diabetes,"I purchased this book (in spite of the objectionable title)the week after my husband was diagnosed with diabetes after finding a reference to it on the American Diabetes Association website. He read it cover to cover very quickly. It provided him with a good background on the disease, took away some of his initial panic and was helpful in identifying lifestyle changes surrounding diet and exercise that he needs to make. Some of the dietary info was in conflict with what his doctor had told him, but we have are now in a diabetes education program which is very helpful."
4,diabetes book,I bought as gift for a family member. It had helpful information but did not have what we were looking for in it. It should of had info on carbs and sugars but it does not.
4,A wealth of information,I've been reading this book for about 2 weeks now. There is a lot of information and education to take in. It's been great at demystifying the large amounts about diabetes that is available. I used this before we went to the Nutrition Counselor. I feel it helped me take in the additional information that she had without feeling so overwhelmed. I recommend this if it's yourself or a family member that's been diagnosed. With so much information being thrown at you with a new diagnosis it is nice to sit down and read and assimilate at your own pace.
4,"Diabetees for Dummies, a Good Primer","Being new to the World of Diabetees, there are many things we hear, read, even assume. It helps to have a reference like D for D to clarify terms, provide insight and generally take away some of the mystery of my Disease."
2,Not very informative,"A waste of money and time, Lansford must be getting paid by the Bush administration"
4,Overcoming Boundaries,"I watch this one and always think in my home country they should handcuff the so called opposite sides together and see what happens. Sidney Poitier whom my mother always talked about when I was a kid and insisted that I and my sibling watched his movies, is magnificent. He is such a charismatic, beautiful graceful man even when portraying a convict. I remember getting angry watching this because of the racism, hatred and ignorance it portrayed. Yet like all great Hollywood movies there is a real catharis at the end when the Curtis character will not betray his partner in chains, now his equal and friend. I am sure that when it was made in the late 50's/ this film was bold in its subject matter, yet today in most civilised societies thoughts of difference should never cross our minds, but I am sad to report it often does, so this great movie even though it is a (plot formulaic set piece) is still relevant today in it overall message."
4,About the love of two men,"Both men love each other. One of them gives up freedom and the love of a woman to be with his man.The last scene is the beautiful picture of both men holding each other tightly, their faces touching, and their eyes looking at the next 20 years when they will be always together, happy ever after."
2,Overrated,"Vastly overrated. While the subject matter of this film was surely controversial in 1958, it's simply not a good film: Tony Curtis doesn't' sound believable for a second as a supposedly tough convict, Theodore Bikel (? - a Jewish singer/actor) as a Southern sheriff isn't believable either, and the entire concept of a woman so lonely that she would take in not only two convicts in chains, but a black prisoner at all, is completely laughable. There are some fine moments in this, and I understand its cultural importance, but it's nothing special.This script won an Oscar ? Must have been a lean year."
5,Best of their early work,"This is some of their best early work from Light Records...this set includes the entire Tomorrow album plus a few bonus cuts from previous albums you're sure to enjoy. A collector's item, no doubt."
4,It's a good book,"Over all it's a good book but of course you must keep in mind that this is copied from older work(s) that have had the copyright expire or something. You can tell the images and pages have been scanned, that being said, the content is excellent with a lot of discussion and pictures of prehistoric artifacts that I have never seen before (and I consume a lot of books in this area)."
1,"Good concept, ugly shoe!","I really respect the fact that Donald J Pliner is dedicated to making comfortable shoes. However, if comfortable shoes look like this I'll just take the sore feet! Some of the shoes in this brand are cute, fun and sexy as well as comfortable but this is NOT one of those examples! Reminds me of a witch shoe or something my grandma would wear! This pointy toe thing just needs to go away! I don't understand what is so appealing about having your toes crunched into a cone shape and having your feet look bigger! These don't look comfortable, they don't look feminine or attractive and they cost a lot of money. Oh well, I guess everyone has their own taste! Thanks again to amazon for posting accurate photos."
5,How happy am I?,"I remember watching this series many years ago, and I have been looking for it ever since. The series contains humour, pathos, longing for the past, and working through past loves and hates.Remembering one episode in particular makes me very sad because of the poignancy of the situation. If you haven't seen the series, I'll give you a hint: the protagonists can be remembered ONLY while they are the sight of the person looking at them. Once they move from that person's line of sight, they are forgotten.So, roll on 14 February 2012 - this is on my MUST BUY list."
5,The best movie ever made.,"I don't believe any other movie brings as much as this one -period- I have waited soooo long for the Blu-ray release.If they ever bring 4K TV and release this again - I will buy it. The only thing better, If Arnold,Sandahl,James Earl and the rest of the cast would show up on my front door in full attire."
3,Don't tamper with a classic,"This new version is wonderful to look at, and the bonus features are excellent. Sandahl Bergman still smoking hot. SUBOTAI!But the ending is different from the original version. Recall (in the original release) the final scenes where Conan dispatches Thulsa Doom and sets fire to the temple at the mountain of power. The long static shot of Conan in closeup before he takes up the flaming urn and hurls it high on the temple steps. I got to that point in the new 'collector's edition' and, SPOILER ALERT the addition of one extra character completely changed the feeling and tone of the ending. I didn't like it.I will return to the original version the next time I watch ""Conan""."
2,could have been better,"Let me start off saying that I enjoy movies based on mythology/fantasy and though alot of people may disagree with me, I felt that Conan the Barbarian doesn't live up to the hype that's been given to it. I have never seen an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie that I didn't liked so I decided to watch this one having high hopes that it would be an action packed movie with a great plot. Has Arnold ever settled for less? Well, apparently after doing Conan he decided that he needed better roles. Conan the Barbarian seemed a bit drawn out half way through and I was really hoping for a good fight scene between Conan and Thulsa Doom. Besides that, the ending was mediocre and left much to be desired in my opinion. I'm not saying this movie completely stinks. I just felt that more should have been done with it."
1,"Five star movie, one star blu treatment","Where is the extended version?? So Universal decided to skimp that for blu-ray?? How lame and pathetic. No extended, BOOO!!!! No sale. Just like their lackluster Army of Darkness video releases. Boycott."
2,disappointing,i was pretty disappointed with the remake. Whilst the production value was definitely grand the story wasnt all that great. at the end i think the original was still pretty fantastic.
1,Director's Cut Should Be Cut,"I own both the 1998 DVD release and the Director's Cut (Collector's Editon). Crom, the 1998 release is by far the better version. The Collector's Edition adds in unnecessary scenes. There is even a scene where Conan is talking philosophy! It just doesn't fit in. The added scenes feel 'forced' into the movie. The film WAS perfect. I can't watch the Collector's Edition without feeling disappointed. If you can get a copy of the 1998 DVD release, go for it. The picture is not as nicely finished as the Collector's Edition, but you really don't notice any flaws as you watch the movie. My dream scenario is for a new release of the original movie with a more finished picture. I would pay a third time for this movie if they were to do that. Love Conan... hate the Director's Cut."
1,They screwed this transfer up.,I recommend that you don't buy this edition of Conan. The movie is one of my all-time favorites but the audio transfer of this film was completely screwed up by Universal and key music from the Basil Poledouris score was deleted from the film. The incredible score is one of the things that makes this film shine. Shame on you Universal for putting out an inferior product and trying to dupe consumers.
4,Apocalypse THEN!,"If the story sounds a bit familar it should, John Milius also co wrote ""Apocalpse Now"". Conan is Willard and Thulsa Doom is Kurtz.Both Doom and Kurtz lose their heads in a temple!"
2,Bad bad bad !!!,"A master medium (with a map clearly showing a fingerprint) with an image ""type film"" ... The compression is almost invisible black and pretty good overall (sometimes a bit noisy), however the lack of any homogeneity in contrast and definition (sometimes the image is too sweet and sometimes too clear: I suspect the use of ""edge enhancement"") and the color palette appears often fade in short, even if the pleasure is there , we expect much better!"
3,What is best in life?,"""To crush your enemies, see them driven before you, and hear the lamentation of the women."""
5,"Conan, the Immortal Genius","A young boy who witnesses his parents' deaths is taken prisoner and grows up as a slave for the snaky Thulsa Doom. His kingdom is full of nudity and snakes. The boy grows up to be a fighter, thief and warrior. He goes through a lot of weird situations involving a witch, who he throws in a fire and devouring combatants in dungeon fighting! With the help of a wizard and Valeria, the woman he loves, Conan rules the kingdom. I was deeply touched by this legend and wished upon a star for the gods to make more of these movies. Arnold Schwarzenegger stars in his first barbaric role and proves that if you want to rule, you must have a big sword. Sharp! When Arnold perpetrates the king's lair, it's historical. Revenge has never been prettier. Talk about violence! Conan puts the sword to good use and when he gets his hands on the creature which killed his parents, it's astonishing! He must have thrown that head twenty feet! Grotesque! This movie is remarkable."
1,Why not stereo?,"I saw this movie in the theatres and have the soundtrack. It's one of the best film scores ever! But then when released on video it's in MONO! What gives? Whoever decided to do that is ripping off the public, in my opinion. I know it was in stereo at the big screen, so mr DVD producer (and LD and VHS) why not now? Folks, this movie was designed as set pieces based partly upon the musical score (see the Varese Saraband soundtrack CD for details). To release it in Mono is a sin. Save your money. It's really not worth owning as it is now."
4,There is a reason the out-of-print version costs more.,"The ""making of"" and commentary are a nice addition to this release. However, the extra footage is garbage and costs this version 1 star.The additional dialog between Conan and Subotai is weak, disrupts the flow of the leadup to the last battle and features Gerry Lopez sounding far more Pro Surfer than Mongolian, dude. Likewise the new edit of the final scene is disjointed, doesn't sync nearly as well with the score and isn't nearly as striking visually as the Original Theatrical cut.Universal, please make a new version available."
3,Strange blu-ray release,"The blu-ray release is a strange mashup of the Director's Cut and the original theatrical release. I thought I was getting the original theatrical release, as I kind of missed the original ending (and didn't much care for the quality of the added scenes with Conan and Subotai in the Director's Cut) and wanted a copy of the original version. I thought this was, but it's not. FYI."
3,It's not in stereo!!!!,"I can't believe this classic movie, with pretty good features, is not in stereo! And this is not [an inexpensive] DVD. I know people (myself included), that have the soundtrack to this movie, specifically because of the powerful music. Not to hear it in stereo, with the many great moments of warriors entering battle, is like someone taking candy from a baby. I did enjoy listening to Arnold and John Millius commentating, but how could I overlook the ""mono"" sound?"
2,"Loved the movie, but was disappointed by the DVD","Conan the Barbarian's one of my all time fave movies. However the DVD was so sorry. The picture was grainy and had a pulsing in the background. You'd think they would've done a digital transfer, but no. The soundtrack was in mono! Give me a break! Couldn't they have at least remastered it to a 2.0 soundtrack if not 5.1? And yes it can be done, because the original Terminator was in mono, but was remastered to Dolby Digital 5.1. I really wish the same care would've been taken with Conan the Barbarian."
2,zero for sound,"the color and picture quality were very good and true to the theatre however the sound seems to have been left on the remake floor. if a 1955 movie ie: Brigadoon can be remade into 5.1, universal pictures doesn't seem interested in producing an 1982 movie in 5.1 which would have givin this movie 5 stars, and been worth buying."
1,COULD HAVE BEEN GREAT!!!!!,"This is not only Arnold's best role but it is by far my favorite Arnold Schwarzenegger movie!I would love to give this DVD a higher rating than ""1"" but when you consider that it has one of the greatest soundtracks of any movie and that the ""Collector's Edition"" presents this in Dolby Mono, I'm sure you can understand the low rating. WHO DOES THAT? I don't think I can name one other DVD that has sound in ""mono"". Even the cheapest and lowest of low movies are usually at least in Dolby Stereo.I have seen some older films with better sound, I have seen second rate ""B"" movies with better sound, and yet somehow... some genius decided to put this in ""Mono""?Heck... ""Caveman"" with Ringo Starr is even in 5.1 yet they are only going to provide Conan in mono?It is a shame that such a great movie is treated with such disregard."
5,the Ultimate,"Arnie's best movie ever!Gory,violent&uncut!This beats even Lord of the rings by it's music,actors&plot(yeah right!).This goes all the way 2nd on my top5 list!Only Evil Dead beats this movie!I've read all the Conan comic-books,&this is better!Watch this,if you can stomach it!"
5,Conan The Barbarian,"One of my all time favorite movies. This role was made for a young Arnold. He watches his parents get killed as a child. The enemies spared his life- a big mistake. Conan grows up and puts in work, barbarian style. I dont know how many people will enjoy this movie in this day and age, but for us old school folk, simply one of the best movies ever made."
5,Classic,"One of my top 20 movies. The set design, the music, everything takes you into this mythical time and place. Arnold accent and lack of speaking is actually a huge asset for this film since Conan is supposed to be a Barbarian of few words. James Earl Jones plays Thulsa Doom a villain who is a combination of Hitler+Jim Jones meets an evil wizard. There's something about this movie that makes it feel timeless. I'd say this is one of Arnold's best movies."
5,true to the image in the comic books,"this is simply a kick a$$ movie. The fact that there is very little dialogue doesn't matter. Arnold can really swing the sword!! This is one of the best action movies that I have ever seen. James Earl Jones was the perfect villian. It's amazing how good a movie with blood, guts, swords, and horses can be."
4,Best of it's genre,This movie is the best of it's genre not only because it spawned countless rip-offs but because it had originality.
1,Cannot opt out of deleted scenes,"This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time... but this edition is awful. It adds deleted scenes into the movie proper, and you can't opt out of that 'feature'. It completely ruins the movie for me, and makes this DVD a complete waste of money as well. I would have liked to have gone through the deleted scenes as you do with any other movie; afterwords as a lark. There is a -reason- these scenes were deleted.. I wish they'd kept it that way, or made this a two disk set: one with the scenes in, one with them out, the way they did Legend."
4,"Good at times, ridiculous at other times","This movie was Arnold's breakout film, and established him as a box-office draw. Watching the movie now, almost three decades later, one can see why it was so popular. The special effects are good, the acting is decent, the script is fairly interesting, and the casting is perfect. Most of the movie is serious, with the ocassional slapstick comedy scene thrown in; the camel punch is probably one most fans remember. And the movie was innovative in its use of a narration followed by a flashback to set the context for the film's plot. The soundtrack is better than average, though for a film of this quality, it deserved a better score. Overall, a good film."
4,An Arnie classic with great action,"Although I kind of like the less darker sequel more this is still a good movie. After viewing it again I enjoyed it more than the last times I've seen it. I always liked it but before now I just found the comfrontation befween Arnold and James Earl Jones at the end to be disapointing.(...) I know I'm sadistic lol. Anyway would've been bettter if they had this big sword fight instead.The movie is a lot better made than the sequel which had some bad effects but I think it trys too hard to be a big epic, it drags on too long. It is silly that James Earl Jones leads a clan of people who just wanna turn into snakes. Connan's mean for denying them that lol. For the best adventure fantasy of the ""80's"" I'd still have to go with the under-rated Willow though."
4,One of Arnold's First,"I have seen this movies several times, and although I cannot say that it is one of my favorites, it is far from the worst I have ever seen.This is certainly one of Arnold's first flicks, and although his acting was not at the level it is now, he didn't do a half bad job.This is a film that is a must have if you collect classics."
3,"Great movie, but terrible DVD transfer","Love this movie, but the DVD transfer actually looks worse than the LD. And only pro-logic sound!"
3,Stupid and Gory but On-Target,"This is a dumb, over-long at times just plain terrible movie. It is also faithful to the spirit of the pulp novels on which it is based. As such, it cannot be too criticized for its excesses. Let's just say that there is a lot of gore, violence, sex, nudity and moronic dialogue. Schwarzennegar and his co-star Sandhal Berman are both pretty talentless, but look good in various states of undress and can finesse their way through the numerous comic book-style fight scenes. What James Earl Jones is doing in this pleasantly over-heated junk is anybody's guess, but his hammy performance adds one more layer of kitschy fun to an already preposterous cinematic outing."
4,Who the Hell is Luis Barboo?,"OK, was the Amazon server hacked or what? Starring Luis Barboo? What the bloody hell is going on here; is this an All Hallow's Eve prank? Could someone please explain how Luis Barboo can be listed in the lead role when we know it is 'the Governator'!"
5,Easily one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.,"No, I don't think it was meant to be a comedy but it serves up lots of laughs (for example, the wizard who lives in a treehouse). Its sort of unintentionally Monty Python-esque I guess you could say. It has a lot of campy value but there are also some great visuals as well. I laughed so hard I cried."
5,classic sword and sorcery,One of the classic sword and sorcery movies out there. Very well done and entertaining. I've watched it too many times to remember.
3,Too many boring bits!,"I bought this book because I have travelled by train in both North and South America and was interested to see how things have changed since then. Although Theroux can be witty, sarcastic and interesting to read, he has concentrated too much on the bad, boring bits such as the Central American section. I haven't read the whole book yet (he has just reached Colombia) but if things don't improve I think I will give up on it."
4,ideosyncratic but powerful descriptions,"The descriptions of what Paul observed while on the trains, under varying conditions, are what I enjoyed the most- they are clear and powerful. Better yet, he lets you in on what he is experiencing while he is describing, so you can perceive his state of mind at the time (which often has a very strong influence on how he describes various places), and what he is reading. He also focuses in on the most quirky ""characters"" that he meets in the towns and on the trains. His writing style is highly entertaining thoughout the entire book. I liked the fact that he didn't travel first class, but ""mucked in"" (as Michael Palin said in his TV travel series)."
5,From Boston to Patagonia by Train,"Note: I made some immature Mormon angry because of my negative reviews of books that attempted to prove the Book of Mormon, and that person has been slamming my reviews almost as fast as they are posted.So, your ""helpful"" votes are appreciated. Thanks, and note that a short review is not necessarily a bad review if it leads you to a great book.From Boston to Patagonia by train. What an adventure. As I wrote in my review of the ""Great Railway Bazaar,"" treat yourself to traveling the easy way and read one of Paul Theroux's books.Peter Mathiessen described the ""Old Patagonian Express"" perfectly: ""Sharp-eyed, honest, and exceptionally well-written...an implacable landscape, conveyed through a series of marvelous encounters."""
2,disappointing trip with Paul,I enjoyed the Dark Star Safari with Paul very much and carried that level of expectation with me on this trip through the Americas.It was an unfair comparison because of Paul's history with Africa his insights there were based upon his Peace Corps experiences there.The trip through the Americas seemed to be a struggle for Paul and didn't have the historical awareness and intimate connection with the areas covered so the depth that I was hoping for was lacking.
4,The Old Patagonia Express,"Theroux is one of my favorites. ""Riding the Iron Rooster"" initiated me to his books; the ""Patagonia Express"" was a good follow-up. He is an intellectual fellow, I suspect, whom I'd enjoy meeting one day. Theroux writes a reliable read. Get it, and enjoy him. <vossj@mdot.state.mi.us>"
3,Don't be such a whiner Paul!,"Jesus, man! Are you always this annoyed with life? I liked your book but only because you met Borges and were Poe-obsessed throughout the entire trip. But my suggestion is to GO HOME next time you write a complaint filled travel book."
1,Unlikable,"In the ""new"" introduction, the author talks about this opinion out there that travel books always end up being about the author him/herself. He goes on to imply that his book won't be like that. He also says he intended the book to teach us and illustrate to us the countries he visited. Well, he failed on both counts.It's full of condescension, self-absorption, and odd, racism-tinged comments."
3,Cranky,"Although some of the author's anecdotes were enjoyable, I became tired of his cranky observations of Latin America..."
5,The Old Patagonia Express,"Great book..arrived in a few days. No issues at all.In fact, I have never had any issues with ordering anything through Amazon!"
2,Can we have an explorer's perspective please.,"Paul's books provide a very detailed travel account. But, it appears to be a reporter's view. His writings lack the passion of an explorer. Travelling to distant places is essentially a journey within. Great travelers wouldn't ridicule the places they visit or the people they meet. In this book he seems describing the slums and the poverty of Mexico and other countries. Trust me, not many people want to be poor by choice.Traveling is a sublime, spiritual & learning experience. It is an opportunity to look beyond our perceptions & bias. His writings are just an account of what he saw, they lack the light of a traveler..."
1,Dont throw away your time or money,"When I saw this book at the bookstore I imagined it would be very good, a train ride trough the continent!, it is really about complaining on everything, he should have stayed home!, I kept reading because I was expecting it to get better, but it really did not, this was the first and last of his books that I buy, I am sorry but as a traveler I expected much more, I could not imagine a more unfriendly person writting about travels."
1,train wreck all the way,"Ok I agree with what most other reviewers have to say a disaster from the start, he should have flown to Patagonia and saved us the anguish of laboring through his journey. It was condescending and degrading in its description, being a former PCV and an extensive traveller I would definately not degrade those around me for being poor.It would make an amazing diary, if someone else had written it! I was barely able to read the 1st 4 chapters and realized it was only getting worse and dropped it."
3,NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.......,"I WAS EXPECTING GOOD SOLID MUSIC LIKE THAT OF DAVID ARKENSTONE,BUT ALAS, THIS WAS VOCAL. I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS CD.I HOLD THAT ONE WOULD THINK THE MUSIC OF THE JOURNEY OF THEDUNADAN WOULD BE RICH AND STRIKING, WOULD TAKE YOU AWAY TO THEMANY LANDS TRAVELED BY THE DUNADAN, NOT SOME GROUP OF PEOPLESINGING AS IF THEY WERE AT THE PRANCING PONY...."
4,Most favorite brand of casual dress shoe!!,"I love the fact that when you put on a pair of Skechers, they fit right away. I can put them on for the first time just before a long day of walking and not worry about blisters, sore feet or too tight. I have bought similar models to this one every year since 2004 and the only complaint I have about these Skechers and other models like it are the rubber soles are the same materials put on running shoes, so while the grip on a slope is great, they wear out pretty quick if you walk on sidewalks a lot.Comfort: 10Uppers: 10Sole: 7Lacing: 8Weather Resistence: 10"
5,Excellent Product,We have purchased both the Traverse City dried cherries in plain as well as the yogurt-covered and find the quality to be the best of any similar offerings we've come across elsewhere in our travels. We highly recommend if you enjoy dried fruit. The cherries are actually quite moist yet in their dried state and not tough and chewy as much dried fruit turns out to be . . . .
4,A cute first book for children,"This is a nice little book for young crystal enthusiasts. It introduces several members of the quartz family, as well as concepts such as cleansing, programming, chakra balancing, and is full of ideas for meditation and crystal healing.Some of the terminology is a bit above many beginning levels, which makes this book great for reading as a family, and it is likely to improve children's vocabularies."
4,Great CD,Another really good New Found Glory CD.. now I have something to listen too again.. The two killer tracks on this CD are Truth of My Youth and Failures Not Flattering.. both songs in my opinion are better then the first single release (All Downhill from Here).. this is a CD that the more you listen to the more you like..
2,When will it ever end?,"I have one thing to say, the guy cannot sing...at all. it was excuseable on the first one and then the ""Sticks and Stones"" was somehow awesome and then Catalyst. To lead singer dude from New Found Glory, stop singing through your nose."
5,Too Much New Found Glory,"I've been a fan for a long time and this and their last albums are really awesome. I highly recommend both for old fans or new time listeners. They could legitimately release half of both cds as singles, in my opinion."
4,"Surprisingly, this NFG's latest rocks!","After their mediocre third CD ('Sticks & Stones'), I didn't have much hopes for their latest, but it's really good! The songs each have a lot of character and uniqueness (compared with the other songs on the CD), unlike the the second half of NFG's last CD, which starts to sound like the same song over and over. It's just great stuff and as a bonus, the ""secret"" track is hillarious (unlike their other secret tracks, which were painfully lame)."
5,Excellent,This album was great. I had to listen to it a few times before i loved it do death. I recomend this to any NFG fan. A must have as this band grows into the young men they are.
4,alright....for people who like GC and stuff....,"Yeah, I like music like this a bit and it was good, even for people who like heavier stuff. Yeah alright....buy it, its good. But for some true NFG buy some old stuff, that stuff is good too."
3,"Decent, but I expected more.","New Found Glory was at one time one of my favorite bands,their self titled album was genius, every single song was amazingly addicting and easy to listen to. On this CD, there are a few songs that were pretty good, but all the others were just bland, and, well, half-decent. ""Truth of My Youth"", ""Failure's Not Flattering"". and ""This Disaster"" were among my favorites, while sonsg like ""I Don't Wanna Know"", ""Over The Head, Below The Knees"" and ""No News is Good News"", were just plain bad. This CD also contains possibly the worst extra track ever made, totally ruining the end of the CD. Buy it if you like New Found Glory, not if you like Good Punk Albums."
3,They Missed the Mark,"Look, I love NFG as much as you guys, so maybe that's why I expect so much from them. This cd did not meet my expectations. Its a good, but not great album. I found myself pulling this out of my cd player after only a couple days. That being said, I did like the cd, its just not as good as the previous albums in my opinion. But for NFG fans, its still worth the purchase."
3,Alright I guess,"New Found Glory has progressed so much since they started back in Coral Springs, but I didn't really feel the musical growth for their new album, Catalyst. If catalyst is a reference to the change that they have had over the past two years, I wish it hadn't happened. The record is solid and has the classic overlayings of Jordan singing the refrain in his high and low voices. You shouldn't regret buying it though and it is a great asset to the collection. Perhaps the album will grow on me and act as a catalyst changing my opinions of the album, but right now I'm not really feeling it."
3,They sure know how to disappoint.,"To me, this is just another mediocre pop-punk album from a mediocre pop-punk band. I did like 'All Downhill From Here' for its guitars and faster tempo, but it really did go downhill from there (heh heh). The vocals have been done before, the lyrics are average, and the instruments are alright. This is a good album if you're just looking for a fun, poppy feel, but a bad one if you're looking for a little depth."
1,BEST CD EVER?! MAYBE IN HELL!,"This band is one of those sissy poser bands like Green Day, Good Charlotte, SUM 41, NOFX(no effects, but they still sound like posers), anything the Offspring has done since Americana(the first 4 CDs are good), or Blink 182. Poser bands have corrupted what people think punk is(especialy Green Day, they and their ""punk"" friends started it), and it sickens me. I'm just glad there are some real punk bands like the Casualties still left. When i was young i used to like poser bands, but that is all i was ever exposed to, and now i hate that wussy s***."
1,"Jeez, when will it end!?!!?!?!?","o jeez, i thought that all this pop-punk crap died out years ago when metal came back into the scene. How can you guys listen to this stuff? The singer sounds like a dumptruck is running over a squirrel, and some people even try to defend him by saying his voice is ''unique'', pshh, yeah right. Listen to real music."
1,Terrible,"This is one of the worst cd's i've bought in a long time. There are two good songs on the whole cd, All Downhill From here and I don't wanna know, every other song is mediocre and unispired. Most of the songs are depressing which is stupid. If I wanted to listen to some guys whine about their troubles in life I'd go pick up a Staind cd or something thats supposed to be depressing. This cd makes me depressed and may cause me to lose all faith in rock music. I'm extremely dissapointed. This cd is trash."
2,Mediocre,"I listened to this on MTV.com's ""The Leak,"" I admit im not a big pop punk fan but I can still judge, for example the new Blink CD is pretty good.This CD on the other hand, is repative and very mediocre, not BAD tho, any fan will probably like it but new fans stay away, All Down Hill From Here is one of the better songsAnd what happened to Jordans voice? it was never great but the producer made it really annoying. The best song is probably No News is Good News, but yeah very mediocre CD, its different than the other tho, each songs starts out ""harder"" but then goes into the same pop-punk formula as the other CDs."
2,hmm..,"okay, i'm not going to judge them like at all considering i've only heard two songs but they sound like dying squirrels. the two songs i've heard are their two singles an honestly, they aren't bad songs at all. i just wish that they had a different singer who didn't sound like a squirrel. anyways, the only reason why i'm not giving them one star, is because they write good songs (well, from the two that i have heard, lol) but they really need to get a new singer."
2,Punk rock? Yeah right!,"From all the stupid romors I've heard, New Found Glory was an awesome punk rock band. I decided to test my luck and by this CD.Okay, for anyone who things this is punk, you are sadly mistaken. Just listening to the vocals, I could tell this is pop.The only slightly decent song on this whole album is ""All Down Hill From Here"". And ever in that song, the chorus is the only good part. Every other song on this album isn't worth listening to.If you want some good punk rock, buy Bad Religion or Dropkick Murphys, but whatever you do, do NOT buy this CD! If you are a fun-loving pop fan, get this album and be overjoyed."
1,New Found GARBAGE! No style and substance!,"'Dime a dozen' bands like 'New Found Boring' are an embarrassment to real punk music. This whiney, geared for 12 year olds, overly-commercial 3 chord nonsense is a true testament to how the youth of today has massively lowered their standards in their choices of music! The 'dumbing down of America' continues unabated not only in politics and education, but in their pathetic choices of rock and pop music. For real punk substance and talent, go listen to your parent's Clash, Ramones, Sex Pistols, P.I.L., Dead Kennedys, Gang Of Four, and Stranglers albums, as a start."
3,theyre a 3 star band. bottom line,"i say this...because...while they can be musically powerful...the vocals have always been..and will probably always will be...a little weak. sounds like hes trying to force too much sound out of his mouth and some goes out of his nose. it gets annoying, no matter how catchy the song is. this is one of those bands that will have a constant 16 year old fan base. i remember when i got their first album...it was ok. got their seecond album thinking...""hey...they can only get better"" but..they just got more experienced and not much better. this album would have been so much better if he took some voice lessons. whining aint so hot no more."
1,this is just sad...,I'm am soooo disapointed in NFG. I think they're new cd is crap and there old stuff like Sticks and Stones and New Found Glory were beyond better than Catalyst. There new stuff gives me a headache...its that bad. I do not recommend this cd at all. gag.
3,"3.5, actually....","I'm a New Found Glory fan, I've got the full-lengths, and I still love them.The songs you like will grow on you quickly, the songs you don't like you'll learn to skip quickly. This album is more likely to be heard as every-other-track-sounds-the-same. Sticks and Stones was quite a bit more distinctive musically. The lyrics have been jumping out at me from different places every time I've listened to the album.All in all,it's a little different, but not enough to put me off listening. Fans of the band will probably still enjoy it, if you've never liked them you probably still won't, but I won't be raving about it. Catalyst isn't bad, but my socks are still on."
5,Catalyst:::,"I think this cd is probably one of New Found Glory's best yet. I thought it was cool how they still are going punk but are also playing some slower songs. The style's a little bit different on this new CD, but if you're a NFG fan I'm sure you'll love it!"
4,"They've Done Better, But It Still Is Awsome!","The CD is very, very good. Even if you aren't a fan of punk rock, there still is something for you. The music ranges from a nice quiet sound to a very fast and hardcore punk sound. I have to say that I think the album cover is'nt that great, but its the music that counts. In my opinion the best song is either ""All Downhill From Here"" or ""No News is Good News"". They are a very good and highly talented band, Drive Tru Records should be proud to have them on their label. I hope that they'll make another CD, and make it as good as the rest. There really isnt any bad songs on the CD, and heres a shocker, even the intro is good. Well, as iv'e said before NFG kicks ass and is the best band out there. Good luck to them, and I can't wait to see them at the Warped Tour this June."
4,"The kings of ""pop-punk"" reign supreme","I bought this expecting a good, but not fantastic, rock CD. After hearing a few songs like ""All Downhill From Here"" i knew the cd would be worth buying. I didn't expect it to be this good.I thought i would never buy a New Found Glory cd. I heard STICKS AND STONES when it first came out, and i hated it. Heard the self-titled one, too. I wanted to shoot myself after hearing that monstrosity. But CATALYST has more substance to it, and i think they'll win over a lot of new fans while pleasing old ones. Jordan's voice is less whiny - he's actually made it sound good! Standout tracks are the single ""All Downhill From Here,"" ""I Don't Wanna Know,"" and ""No News Is Good News,"" but like i said, the album is solid from beginning to end.The year's first great power pop album is here!"
5,One Word Awesome!,"Catalyst, the brillant new release from New Found Glory, is not only awesome, but an incredible improvment, and it shows the bands growth in many ways, whilst staying with the same old New Found Glory sound every diehard New Found Glory fan loves. I give it 100 stars!! and I recommend everyone to go out and pick it up!"
2,HOW DARE THEY SAY WERE NOT THE SAME!!!!,"This band sounds like every modern college rock band thats ever existed. I really hate to say a band is terrible but every song on this cd sounds the same. The intro is unbearable to listen to. ""All DownHill from here"" is decent. ""This distaster"" Is pretty good but everything else is just terrible. Every track will sound the same and if you have your cd play it randomly you will swear you've heard the same song 3 times in a row. Their radio hits were their only hits so don't bother wasting money on this cd."
2,umm..nah,I'm not a nfg hater or anything but i bought this cd cause i thought all downhill from here was a great song. but this cd is just 13 other tracks of poor pop punk. i cant even remeber any other song off the cd (besides all downhill from here) because all the songs sound the same and just kinda mesh together in one big mess.
1,luvvv NFG,"yaaaaaaahhhhh, I'm a little teenager who loves NFG and yellowcard. I mean, how could you not love them????. their lyrics are sooo inspiring. listin to the lyricz:last year was one of our better years in a life full of separationit's ok to second guess just as long as you remember she's gone..Im a gurl and i totally agree with these lyrics! too bad their lyrics dont rhyme....not realy...im not a little teenager nor a girl, i hate yellowcard punk and NFG, their lyrics suck so do their melodies. three chord songs dont cut it. listen to real music...listen to jimi hendrix, van halen, metallica, black sabbath, stevie ray vaughn. You wouldnt be reading this if it werent for them."
1,I HATE this crap,"I think viewers should be payed for even having to endure this crap when all you wanted to see was good music. Same old ""modern, new age punk"" here. If you like this crap, you PROBABLY like other crap A$$ bands on the ""market"" --Simple Plan, Blink-182, Story Of The Year, Yellowcard... commercial scum"
1,don't,"i would'nt pay that much for a stupid little import with bonus tracks for a band that can't sing, i would for a good band but not new found glory to me they are also named just one word: gay"
4,Not Downhill,"This cd creates a beautiful mix of sound and lyrics. the song this diaster does not have any meaning to the description of this album. with hard beats and pounding drum solos, this is one of the top ten cds of 2004.-cali_surfer009"
4,Pretty Damn Good,"New Found Glory really hasnt changed in there new cd ""Catalyst"" but stayed the same. And thats a really good thing in some cases. Blink 182 changed for the better.. they were getting to old for fart and poopie jokes, i still love em but marks like 35. anyways nfg still sounds like they always did and thats awesome to see a band put out 5 cd's and still sound the same. Id urge you to go buy it.. even if you dont like it, its only like 10 bucks anyways.BEST SONGS: I dont wanna know, over the head, below the knees, and doubt full.peace"
3,NFG CD,"first of all, the best songs on the cd are:Intro- 9/10 fast paced, goodAll Downhill From Here- 10/10 their single, a good oneThis Disaster- 9.5/10 gets stuck in ur head, but its a good thingYour Biggest Mistake- 11/10 prolly the best one on the cdi cant remember ne other good ones, i usually dont listen to the end of the cd"
4,Freakin' amazing,"if you thought that 'all downhill from here' is good this album is for you. that song is by far extremeley one of the best songs ive heard but so are all of the other songs on this cd. all i have to say is if you dont like it, you dont like a new found glory.sDRUGxFREEx"
2,Whats Wrong With His Voice?,I liked the guitar parts the bass parts the drum parts but then i heard the vocals. the leader singer is anoying and whiny and it sounds like he is singing through his nose. Songs like All Downhill from Here and doubt full have good guitar part but the vocals completly ruin the song. If New Found Glory kicked the lead singer out and got one that dosent sing through his nose they would be a OK band. But that dosent seem like that will happen.
4,New Found Glory = Still going strong!,"Another spectacular album from the punk rock babes. This album is full of original material along with the great vocals of the gorgeous Jordan Pundik. I like it because it shows that they are able to continue to keep growning within their influences, for example, 'Its all downhill from here' is very Alkaline Trio like. Each song is as good as the last and I hope they keep on producing great albums like this and the ones before!! The album is a must! I definately recommend it."
1,"OMG, THESE GUYS SUCK!!!!","THIS IS THE WORST BAND EVER!! THE VOCALIST HAS SUCH A HIGH VOICE! tHEY SOUND LIKE SIMPLE PLAN!! And thats an insult! if u have any of this bands cds, burn them. And go listen to some good music likeLinkin ParkThe UsedNine Inch NailsKornChevelleJay-ZLost ProphetsAlien Ant FarmAFIGreen DayNEW FOUND GLORY IS FOR 9 YR OLDS WHO ARE POSERS!later"

4,better than s&s,"let me first say i thought sticks and stones was a very bad cd, but i am still a fan of nfg. From the screen to your stereo, self titled, and nothing gold can stay were all good cds. i think with this cd they were trying to be a little less poppy than the usually are, but i dont think it was to much of a change. I guess its a little less poppy but it still sounds like nfg. the lyrics i think are just horrible on this cd, nfg have never been great at writing but i think this cd has some of the worst written songs i've ever heard (but that doesnt really make them bad)top 5 songs:1. truth of my youth2. who am it3. this disaster4. ending in tragedy5. all downhill from hillthe main problem i got with this cd is that it all basically sounds the same, all the songs have the same styles in them and it gets kind of repetitive"
1,E W!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"i haTE this crap! unless you want to waste your money, don't buy it, this is really 0 stars, but you can't put that"
2,The Jury's Still Out,"Despite having this CD in my hands for nearly 4 months, I still cannot decide whether I like this disc or not. At times, NFG goes back to the good old days of the ""It's All About The Girls"" EP and ""Nothing Gold Can Stay"", and just as soon switches back to the pop-ish style of the hits from Sticks and Stones and the self-titled album. Buy with caution- I'd recommed picking up a used copy over dropping full price for a new one."
1,Hey...I made money!,I like to think I can find something good about every band I listen to. And New Found Glory record is no exception. I first listened for any type of complexity or originality in the music and found none. Then the lyrical content was searched for anything deeper than emo-punk whining...nope. Then it dawned on me...this CD is so numbingly dull that I will ask my dentist to play it for me instead of shooting me full of novocaine. This will save me about $40...more than the money I paid for the record. Thanks NFG for being so practically boring.
5,Most Gangster ...,"Tego Calderon ""el abayarde"" is the most gangster rapper out there, his lyrics are the best you'll ever hear. If you are into spanish rap this is the best cd you can own."
3,tego calderon,"Honestly....is this cd hot??....it was iight, some songs are hot, but other juss sucked, the only reason im giving it 3 stars is because if it wasnt for tego i wouldnt be listening to reggaeton....mah favorite track is pa que retozen...overall this was okay, wasnt it feeling it like any other fan would...."
4,Excellent Introductory Study,"Reading the Gospel of John provides an excellent staging point for students to discover the enormous depth of this extremely popular re-telling of the Lord's ministry. Kevin Quast, my Professor of New Testament at NABC, studied with one of the pre-eminent Johannine scholars Raymond Brown. However, some may find this book too basic."
2,Anti-American bias spoils book content,"U.S. readers may tire of the book's anti-American sentiment. Unfortunately, it's expressed throughout the book, especially in the historical overview, which is incredibly biased.For a much more objective treatment, I recommend Christopher Baker's Cuba Handbook (Moon Travel). Mr. Baker doesn't seem to have an axe to grind, and simply delivers what one would expect to find in a decent travel guide: Good travel information without all the tedious politicizing.Disclaimer: The aforementioned is an expression of my *opinion* as protected under the U.S. Constitution."
3,Mostly philosophers would be interested in this film.,"""Wittgenstein"" is a good dramatization of the life and work of the 20th century philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein. Mostly philosophers would be interested in this film, because Wittgenstein's life centered around his philosophy, which is very technical. Gay men might also be interested in the movie, because Wittgenstein and director Derek Jarman were gay, and Wittgenstein's homosexuality is one of the topics of the movie. Karl Johnson does a good job of portraying Wittgenstein and his emotional life, particularly his various frustrations at understanding the world and being understood; being a philosopher myself, I found this portrayal particularly moving. The film is shot rather like a play, with minimal sets. Other Cambridge intellectuals, such as Bertrand Russell, are portrayed in the film."
4,Great Reference text,"Pros: Great reference text. The examples are clear and there are generally a lot of them. The notation is generally very readable.Cons: The price. As with almost any physics text, this one is most easily understood if you can compare it to another book of the same level (might I recommend Taylor?) However, the price of this book makes that impractical at best.This book is a good text. It is one of the first books that physics students encounter after their introductory courses which makes for a very challenging semester. I think that may be why it has recieved so many poor reviews. . ."
2,I don't agree with 5 stars...,"There is only one reason : Stephen Thornton has spoiled Marion's original masterpiece. If you can get the 2nd edition, which Thornton didn't join yet, just compare it with current one. Except this, I dare to say this book is the best intermediate classical mechanics text book. This was the bible of classical mechanics, but not any more."
2,"Like so many other science books, not worth the money","I used this book as a physics undergrad in the mid '90s. Like so many others on this site, my copy of M&T; split in half before the semester was even half over. I'd sure love my $80 back plus interest...I thought some of the later chapters were quite good -- particularly the one on Lagrangian dynamics -- but the first few chapters didn't strike me as particularly well written. More than a decade later, I can still recall a problem in Chapter 2 that wasn't even remotely covered anywhere in the chapter itself. It somehow managed to survive to the 4th edition, and I'd be willing to bet it's in the 5th as well.There were lots of things I liked about Marion and Thornton, but generally speaking, if students are expected to plunk down this kind of money for texts on fairly venerable topics, the content should be QA-tested, and the book itself should be reasonably well-constructed."
1,Not very helpful...zzzzz,"After using other Sams learn it all in 21 days books, I was eager to use this one. Tood bad, because I kept losing track of what was going on. Too boring, too meandering. I got through the first week and can't bear to touch it again."
2,utterly boring,"A highly confusing ,questionable and dead book.It doesn't speak to the reader.The only good thing about the book is that it provides a list of good web-sites and there are exercises at the end of each chapter. I have personally no fascination for the 21days... series of books and this book doesn't belie my expectations.A better organisation and presentation could have been planned for the book."
2,Not a good introduction,"I am a graduate student in Computer Science, this was my first XML book. I think the author digresses a lot. I have read the first 7 chapters without gaining good insight into how I can put XML to use, or write my own DTDs and documents. I won't recommend this books as a first book, if at all."
1,After 360 pages full with DTD's it says not to use DTD's,"One of the worst books I've ever read! It's full of hyperlinks that don't exist anymore. It uses an XML-parsers that is no longer developed and not even available anymore. If you use software in a book, deliver a CDROM with that software! At the first days it's full of DTD's. Wow, great I really understood them, but at day 17 they tell me not to use them. Well, I could have saved 17 days of reading! After 21 days of boring reading, you will still have no clue what XML is about. Burn the book, this will not make you any wiser! 0 stars would be better!"
1,Doesn't cut it,"This book was my first exposure to XML. I agree with another reviewer that there were many glaring errors in the code examples and if a technical person had edited this book, these errors should have been caught. So right off the bat, that did not leave me with a good overall impression of the book. I had a work assignment to complete using XML, and none of my colleages had experience it. I ended up putting this book down after about the fourth chapter, and went to Microsoft's Developer Website, which could use some improvement, but surely conveys XML in a better manner than this book. Now that I am comfortable working with XML and stylesheets, I wonder why I struggled so much with it at all. Maybe because of books like this ?"
3,"Dated, but widest coverage","Why hasn't there been a second edition? A lot has changed since this book came out, so the content is pretty dated (especially styles), but the coverage is one of the most complete I've seen; it must be the only book that covers DSSSL!Normally I hate ""teach yourself"" books, but this is one of the better ones."
2,Similar to the preface of a good book...,"Does a great job telling what xml can do, but somehow forgets to show you how its done! Be prepared to buy other references to fill in the gaping holes. Despite the book, xml is rather impressive, though still in its infancy. I recommend the language, not the book."
2,Mr. Kimble-itis,"This book has a bad case of Mr. Kimble-itis (the bumbling county agricultural agent from the TV show ""Green Acres"" who could never get to the point). The author has a hard time getting to the point, and rambles all over the place telling you what it is you don't need to know at this point, but why it is important that I'm not going to tell you about it but will tell you, maybe, at some point later, but, aww' what the heck, here is a bunch of stuff you don't need to know.The errata sheet is rather long, and some of the errors are so glaring I wonder if anyone edited this thing. I spent an hour trying to figure out why the book appeared to contradict itself in several places on the same page until finding the errata sheet."
4,Pretty decent book,"I needed a book that would give me a jump start on XML. Normally I am kind of apprehensive about the ""Teach yourself Swalhili, Russian, Hungarian and Finnish in just 24 hours!!!"" kind of books. I decided to buy it based on the reviews by other readers and it was a good decision. This book really gave me what I needed: a good induction into xml and all related areas and practical examples. However, to my taste the authors could have spent some more on DOM. That is why I rate this book 4 stars."
1,A typical Sams crash-and-burn book,"I've been disappointed by Sams before but this probably was the ultimate money-waste. I felt lucky that my workplace bought this book and not me, but I was forced to read it nonetheless. I must say that after the first 7 days you feel as if you're supposed to know enough about XML, yet when you sit at your desk trying to contrsuct something out of your knowledge, you realize you've learned nothing. Your countless hours infront of this book had gone to waste. It doesn't teach, it lectures. And it's structure is something to laugh about. Instead of teaching you how to make the simplest XML page and then show it with your IE5, it waits untill the 11th day to do that. Makes no sense at all. Stay away from this book... You should wait for Wrox to publish their version of XML tutoring, just to see how these aces cope with it."
1,Too many errors and contradictions,"I was originally teaching myself XML from the W3 and microsoft documentations, but decided to get a book that would provide some application relevance in the learning process. As XML and its associated subsets have evolved this book has become outdated. However the inaccuracies resulting from the evolution of XML after the release of this book are minor in comparison to the contradicting statements and blatant errors present throughout the book. The unfortunate fact is that if you don't already know XML you will not be able to decipher error from fact."
1,Awful book!,"I don't normally write reviews. I think I've done it maybe a half dozen times. And I wasn't planning on writing a review for this one. But I just couldn't hold back any longer.This book is absolutely awful. Now I understand the problem with these books - you need to break things down into easy to bite chunks, and there are times when that is not possible. But where these authors draw those lines is ridiculous! There is no real rhyme or reason to the lay-out of the book. The authors cover DTD's in about 6 different chapters, and normally it's a touch of DTD with everything else and my favorite phrase ""as you'll see in later chapters"". If we're going to see it in later chapters, don't cover it here!Don't purchase this book. It's not worth the money. Check out Inside XML instead if you're looking for a book. It's laid out much better and covers a wider set of topics."
3,Great product - expensive shipping,"I love Paula Deen's sauces and they can be hard to find.This is one of my favorites - it's tart and sweet, but not like a traditional ""Sweet & Sour sauce"". It's smokey and perfect for steaks and grilled veggies.Don't be confused by the photo - they are not selling 3 bottles at time. That's just how they picture it. The steak sauce was reasonable at $6.99, but the shipping was $8.95 by UPS and it was late. The US Post Office would have shipped it cheaper and delivered it faster."
1,true garbage,"As others have noted, these songs have been released under multiple titles. One can hardly even tell that Donna Summer is singing on any of these songs.Highly NOT recommended.If you want a better Donna Summer ""rarity"", look for the ""Lady of the Night"" cd, an album recorded prior to her making it big."
2,SHOUT IT OUT ! ... should've been PUT IT OUT !,"Don't be fooled by the cover photo of Donna Summer on this album. She does very minimal centerstage solo singing here due to the fact that this was more a group or band effort ( don't know if it's the Munich Machine singers or other artists of the Moroder-Belotte family that are singing with her). Why this was ever released remains a mystery. It's a possibility this material was written before her Love To Love You phase or shortly after; There's very little if no information regarding copyright dates, liner notes, or production notes. The other vocalists are a little less enjoyable to listen to. Yet, when Summer does take the lead or background, she shines brighter than the rest of the team on this collaboration ! Buy it if you are nostalgically interested in Donna's earlier disco projects or offerings---However,don't expect her to be the lead vocalist here !"
4,"Excellent, but not quite as wonderful as Pajama Sam 2","Pajama Sam 2 is a hard act to follow, and I am not surprised that the expectations formed by PS-2 were not quite met. PS-3 comes close, though, and I am happy to see my 5-year-old play this game. Pajama Sam is a wonderful role model - energetic, smart, polite, eager to help others, determined and happy to solve problems, funny, creative, and resourceful. The environment of PS-3 is just not quite as richly imagined and full of surpises as PS-2. If you have 1 and 2, you should get 3, but if you are new to Pajama Sam, start with 1 and 2."
2,IT'S KIND OF HARD!!,"Reviewer:10 year oldthis game fun in the begining but hard in the end. I bought this game a year ago and still cant figure out how to free a person!! I was extremly dissapointed, I even asked the company people to help me . But they just ignored me !! i wouldn't by this game if you want to find all the players."
4,"A good time, as usual","I expected my kids (6 and 4) would get tired of the humungous game series of role-playing games (Pajama Sam and Freddi Fish), but they don't! It seems they could play them forever, even though the basic gameplay is the same for all of them. Humungous keeps things fresh by introducing new characters and puzzle types that keep the kids hooked. The story is engaging enough that one kid doesn't mind watching while the other plays. But don't be fooled by the packaging that alludes to the educational benefit of learning about food groups--any learning that occurs will be by accident. Also, a few of the puzzles require reading skills and left my kids calling for help. All in all, a fun game that is worth the price of admission."
2,It is no longer Mac compatible,"The product page says it is Mac/PC, the box does too, and even the disc says it is. However the Mac session is entirely missing. It looks like it was remastered/copied by someone who didn't know what they were doing, and there was no quality control/testing.If you have a Mac, you are out of luck unless you have an emulator and a copy of MS Windows.I've contacted Atari technical support, no answer as yet, if/when they respond I'll update this review."
5,Fun for all ages,I've personally played this game when I was teaching part-time in a computer school for toddlers. I enjoyed it and so did the children. It was a gift request from 11-yr-old pupil of mine in the public school I was teaching in for coming in first place for a national drama competition.
4,Pajama Sam 3,Pajama sam 3 was pretty good since i've got it and i cant find granny smite! im trying too search now on the internet for it! well... i figure i'll find it soon. This game is really good for all ages. Unless you beet it. Then it'sboring i havn't so its fun.
2,Difficult for a beginner,I used this book for a beginner 68HC12 class at my college and I thought it was extremely hard to understand. Most of the examples involve C programming and at the time I hadn't taken a course on C so I didn't know what it was talking about. I think motorola has a lot of useful books if you want to program using assembly language. They have a small black book that goes over all the instructions and then also another book that goes over all the registers. I also beleive this book is wickedly expensive.
2,Hurry Up and End!,"I have tried on several occasions to wade through this 1,000+ page book wanting so much to see it through, but it is a tough book to finish. Way to long, it goes on and on and although the husband and wife team of K.B. Gilden are very good writers, I question how in the world the editors allowed this rambling opus to go to print without cutting out about 500 pages. To compare it to Gone With the Wind is like comparing Valley of the Dolls to To Kill A Mockingbird. Yes, it takes place in the South, but I saw no other comparison. The characters are strange and unlikeable. There are times the dialog is very odd and ambiguous. I want to like this book. Maybe someday something will click, but for now, I can see why it never became a classic despite all of it's ballyhoo upon it's publication."
5,Americans get it - Washington doesn't,"Fixing America is a wonderful but depressing work. Laffey interviewed dozens of ordinary Americans, and their voices are dripping with disappointment and fear. They know what's going on, but the politicians in Washington driving us toward the cliff either don't get it or don't care.But Fixing America isn't lacking hope. The ordinary folks he talks to have solutions. Real solutions. It's just getting the message to Washington that is the problem."
2,Under Black Skies,"Oh, what a terrible movie. I wasted $2.99 that I should have spent on a taco and a soft drink instead.The acting was bad. Where did this guy get the pistol? Was it a Smith and Wesson or a Ruger .357 mag. A gun not used by British soldiers during WWII. Maybe he mail ordered it from America.Sad to say that after watching this movie for 30 minutes I had to turn it off and hopefully never see it again."
1,Type of DVD,Please note that the HD DVD is also Blue Ray and does not play on a standard DVD machine. No clue but wasted an overnight delivery and planned double feature.
1,Omega Man,"I cannot use this item whatsoever. It's my fault, because I didn't notice that it was listed as HD-DVD. I cannot play this item. I will have to discardit. No one else has a HD-DVD player that I know of, either."
3,A MAN WHO THINKS HE IS ALONE BUT IS NOT,"The story of a man(Heston) who survived germ warfare and lives by day searching forthe lair of vampire like mutants and by night is hold up in his fortress-house.OK SCI FI film, its like Last Man On Earth (Vincent Price) with a 70s flare."
3,Disappointing,"For the most part this was a 4 star movie, but then the writing & direction took a downward plunge at the end. That's what pisses me off the most - when the writer plays god & makes some of his characters do & say nonsensical things. That's what happens as this movie reaches its ending."
3,"Just plain WIERD , but truly sci-fi","This movie also , as ""Soylent Green"" should be rated PG13 minimum , possibly ""R"" for nudity alone .STILL , all in all true apocalyptic Chuck Heston SCI-FI . This plot is still world wide , but a ""we against them"" type ; SURVIVAL . ""EVIL government scientist"" Heston becomes a tainted hero . Anthony Zerbe is a GREAT vilain . 2 societies now ; those who survived the plague ravages and those immune or longer onset time of illness . Chuck saves his skin long enough to try to be a hero for the ""new world"" . HOWEVER , which ""new world"" will it be ???WATCH and find out..... who & what is left on earth"
3,Chuck vs the Photophobes,"Gimme Heston vs. crazy villains any day. This is one of the big 70's Sci-Fi movies. Along with ""Planet of the Apes"" and ""Soylent Green,"" these movies made me a big Sci-Fi fan. It's a little cheesy, but it holds up well. one & 1/2 thumbs up."
3,very 70ish,"my Dad just loved this movie but it did not do it for me. Its very 70ish with the ""family"" and all. I liked I AM LEGEND with Will Smith a lot more. But the Will Smith move dose pay a lot of tribute to this movie."
4,Last Man?,"Charlton Heston is Neville, who may be the last normal man on earth, after a biological war has killed everyone. He was able to develop a vaccine but it came too late. He does live with a contaminated zombie like group that call themselves ""The Family"". The Family can't stand the sunlight and they peruse Neville during the hours of darkness. Neville fights back during the hunting down members of the family. Neville is captured by the family and then save by a woman. He uses his serum to save the woman and her family and friends."
4,Omega Man rreminiscent of Vincent Price film,"I really enjoyed this film. It has the same story line as the Vincent Price film, ""The Last Man on Earth"" -but you get the awesome Charlton Heston. There are no stellar performances, but it's still fun to watch. If you enjoy 70's films, then you should definitely watch this."
3,Story characters not just special effects,"It does show its age, but it has characters, personalities not just special effects. There is an explaination of how the situation arose and why he survived. There is also some imagery, annalogies about the situation and the omerga man.The music is ok but dated.The main point is that it shows you what film making was about till mindlessness and profit took over. Yes you actually have something to think about. God forbid!I could say a lot more, but I'll leave it at that. See it and think. Naturally Charlton Heston does a brillant job. A more fitting age, fit and an action character not super human type thanks to special effects. Don't get me wrong love S.E. but used to tell the story not be in substitute of it."
4,Free Zone,Ce Blu ray est Free Zone ... J'ai une PS3 Europe 40G.Francais anglais et sous-titresMono de très bonne facture.
1,"Just because it is a old, doesn't mean it's good","I recently watched this film through the instant view option on Netflix. Heston did a really good job in the Ape films, so I figured I would give this one a shot. Here, Heston overacts, and the motivation behind the way the behavior of the cult is silly, and worse, inconsistent.Simply put, this film is aweful! Not terrible enough to be campy. Just bad enough to make you want your time back."
2,Do you really need this in Blu-Ray???,"Its a corny,cheesy borderline terrible movie with horrible special effects and make-up. Why they released this movie in Blu-Ray is as befuddling as why I bought it. Rent it so you can say you saw it, there's no need to own it."
2,Sound configuration sux,"I hate it when the sound is 1.0, everything thru the center channel. Is 2.0 too much to ask?"
1,4 stars when it's been released but what about now!,"I saw this movie very longtime ago and as a child or teen, I remember how scare I was of the albinos survivors : The family. I found the DVD and I was so excited to see it again. I finally found how silly this movie is. It looks so old now and hairy Heston is quite ridiculous in this role. The make up is laughable and the characters are so borrrrrriiiinnnnggg. This is an old fashioned science fiction movie and you have to watch it with the time it has been released in mind. Believe me It's today a very boring flick."
2,Dated piece of 70s junk.,"I had feared that The Omega Man was not going to be too good, especially since I had never heard of it and it wasn't.Logan's RunandSoylent Greenwere both good, but this one was just plain bad. It was pretty stupid and rather boring too, not to mention that it was ham-fistedly made. The remakeI Am Legend (Widescreen Single-Disc Edition)with Will Smith was slightly better, but only because it was more up to date in story development and how it was made."
2,Too 70s,"I love zombie movies. I loved the remake with Will Smith. I did not love this movie.First of all, the albino creatures had clearly spent a LOT of time in Haight-Ashbury and at Woodstock.Second of all, zombies don't talk. They eat people. They don't stand around and talk about their organization.Third of all, Charlton Heston. I'm sorry, loved him as the head of the NRA, don't care much for his acting."
3,"Not so ""I am Legend""","The movie version of the Richard Matheson book, ""I Am Legend"", that is least like the original story. Definitely a case that Charleton Heston was doing this for the money not because he believed in the project. Decidedly dated (very 70's). Still it is an interesting film that should be owned by all completionists of the ""I Am Legend"" translations. The Vincent Price version, ""Last Man on Earth"" and the recent Will Smith version are recomended above this version.The Blu-Ray transfer is solid. It looks as if it was digitized from the cleanest print available. Not much as far as extras. It was well worth the $10 that I paid for it."
2,"Interesting, could be better","The film, The Omega Man seems to have a very good plot and and could be a much better film then originally anticipated. Charlton Heston puts on a fairly good role as the military scientist that fines the vaccine to the ultimate biological weapon which wipes out the entire world. The Family, a group of slowly decaying survivors try to destroy Neville ( Charlton's character) and to abolish the old ways of life and return to the older "" holy"" way of thinking, thus wiping out mankind's age of the wheel forever. All in all not an entirely bad action-science fiction film, although it is plauged with some mind-bogglingly cheesy lines and awkward action scenes with members of the family dressed up in white make-up, start throwing themselves out windows and chasing Charlton while he is on a motorcycle. The film is alright, but it could be much better."
3,The rating is off,"I wanted to add a warning about the PG rating.The ratings from the seventies are inconsistent. This film has two scenes that have nudity. One shows full frontal nudity of a woman seated on a bed and the other is a side shot of her trying on clothes. The displays are only few seconds of the movie. I saw this in the theater as a teen and didn't remember it. Perhaps because this was blu-ray the details where more noticable.Other comments: There was a lot of gun play in this movie. The scenes showing the deaths of the bad guys were graphic and a little cheesy. Perhaps because this was blu-ray, but the use of paint as blood was quite clear and odd looking. In retrospect, I think this is better than a scene so realistic that you feel a bit sick afterwards.If I were to buy it again, I might get the DVD version instead or more likely I would pass on it."
4,Still a good watch after all these years,"I remember seeing this movie on channel 7's afternoon movie when I came home from school in the 70's and loving it. I watched it again and it is just as good as I remember it. You know how it goes...you remember a great movie you saw as a kid so you go out and buy it, BUT, it turns out to be not so good after all (for example, I remember loving ""The Strongest Man In The World"" with Kurt Russell but recently saw it again and thought it was a bore). Anyway...This movie is still great with a great sci-fi story and a great performance by Heston. The only thing that isn't great are the extras. There is only a short behind-the-scenes extra that actually only whets your appetite for more info.Highly recommended movie."
3,I like post-apocolypse movies but...,"I have mixed feelings about this one. But I do realize what the other reviwers said about 60's-70's camp, before there was camp. If you look past the camp you can see the movie for the idea it was trying to follow, as in the classic I Am Legend. The opening scenes are very good shots of a post-apoc mid 1970's world. I think they achieved the setting very well its one of the best parts of the film. Including the long empty free-way scene, similiar to the '28 days later' empty Highways' scene.The film to me feels like it boggs itself down in cultural/social commentary of the time it is was made. If it was less centered on that idea I think it would have made a better film, myself. But the film does have alot of action and a fast tempo. If you were bored by I Am Legend, you probably will not be bored with this film."
4,Something a little different..,"I saw this movie on TV quite a while ago, yet it has lingered in the back of my mind ever since. Omega Man is a rather eerie look at a very lonely, empty world after biological warfare has seemed to kill everyone on the planet -- except Charlton Heston and some very weird and intolerant mutated people. If you are in the right mood, there are few movies more unsettling and depressing than this dark journey into an unknown future -- set in the early 1970s.From the beginning scene where Charton Heston, who gives a very believable and memorable performance, puts an 8-track in his car stereo and cruises down an empty city street to the theme from a Summer Place, you know you are in for a very timely and intriguing film. The love story subplot will tug at your heart strings as the hope for a healthy future and peace will provoke uncertainty. If you love the 1970s, don't miss this excellent sci-fi thriller, filled with impressive acting and lingering social commentary."
4,The Omega Man...better then I Am Legend,"The Omega Man came out in the early 1970's amid all the doom and gloom of the time...dirty water, dirty air, nuclear war tensions etc. Based on the Richard Matteson book I Am Legend, the Omega Man is the second movie version (the first being with Vincent Price) its not exactly true to the book but what movie is. It is a good movie for its time as it deals with one man's believe that he is the last man on earth and his loneliness with believing it. Out of the three book to movie makes of the book I think this one is the best."
4,Omega Man,A great sci-fi movie that has held up very well and compares favorably with current similar films even with their advanced use of special effects.
5,Vintage film meets blu ray,I was not expecting a film decades old to be of excellent quality when converted to blu ray format. I was surprised and pleased with the excellent picture quality. Recommended.If you are one who can enjoy this genre you will not be disappointed.
5,To J. Bohara,In your review you accidentally said about Neville going through New York. Actually the film is set in Los Angeles not NYC. All the main actors and actresses in this film turn in good performances and despite the slight Starsky and Hutch-look it doesn't come off campy. There are many ways Matthias and co. could've gotten the robes. There are movie studios nearby. realize without any electric heating the LA nights can get cold and the robes are probably warm.
1,A badly dated sci-fi film.,"Heston plays the last man on earth. During the day, he prowls the streets of LA in his Mustang. However, at night he must be back in his upper floor apartment because zombie-mutants come out in the the evening. Both the acting and directing are barely adequate. During the day scenes, you can clearly see other autos and people in the distance (the movie was apparently shot in Los Angeles in the early morning). The make-up and costumes for the zombies are ludicrous. All the actors look glum and dour. I saw this movie when it was initially released and thought is was OK. Unfortunately, it hasn't aged well."
2,Mediocre Sci-Fi Thriller,"With no pun intended, there is a germ of a good story here but the way it's executed is laughable. The direction and script are flat. The thrills and chills aren't all that thrilling and chilling. Attempts at gallows humor are lame at best. Charlton Heston seems to be going through the motions here. Rosalind Cash delivers a cliched soul-sister act. ""The Family"", led by a usually reliable Anthony Zerbe, are laughable instead of scary in their black cloaks, sunglasses, and spooky eyeballs. Do yourself a favor and see the basic premise of this film executed better in Danny Boyle's ""28 Days Later""."
3,Charlton Heston: The Last Conservative on Earth!,"In a sort of goofy version of the culture war, two-fisted Charlton Heston stars as the Last Republican on Earth, clinging stubbornly to his gas-guzzling car and his collection of guns, flame-throwers and grenades. His solitary existence is threatened by freaky albino liberals who outnumber him a hundred to one. Lucky for Heston, they eschew guns and technology (most of the time they just run around in black polyester robes and gnash their teeth). Heston discovers other humans like himself and it looks like there may be a happy ending, but as usual Charlton Heston can't quite dodge that last bullet. The pace of this movie is uneven, alternating between long, talky sections and furious action-movie mayhem. Modern viewers will cringe at Heston's unfortunate decorating choices."
3,Average apocalyptic action,"This is the second version of Richard Matheson's thrice-filmed novel ""I Am Legend."" Charlton Heston leant his commanding screen presence to a string of science fiction films in the 70s, of which this is probably the least, though it is still entertaining. Director Boris Sagal and screenwriter Joyce H. Corrington altered the story to comment on social issues of the time, making the plague victims into a Manson family type commune intent on destroying the last vestiges of the technology that spawned them rather than the more savage mutants that appear in other versions of this story. This makes the film seem terribly dated at times, but it is still enjoyable. Some of the early sequences with Heston wandering alone through an empty city are still creepy."
4,Hi Fi sound,"This is a classic and still a terrific movie. I just wish that those who transferred it from the master to DVD took the time to give it qualty sound. HI FI Sound by todays standard is like listening to a terriffic song in a LEXUS on a walkman.....a great little stereo, but you expexct more and it leaves you disapointed.HAD TO SWITCH THE SURROUND OFF and listen to the mono output on the monitor."
3,Great video. Poor audio,"The movie is a classic. 5 stars for the movie. This review is for the quality of the blu ray disc. Video quality is 5 star. Audio 1 star. Audio is 1.0 MONO. !?!?!?If you have a good home theatre receiver you can 'tweak' it to multi channel, but the disc itself is ONE CHANNEL MONO. But for $12, what do you expect?"
4,Glad I got it.,"If you don't mind watching older movies and you liked ""I Am Legend"" with Will Smith then you may very well like this film."
4,Original Omega Man,"This movie is still a great watch even though it was made more than 40 years ago. The newer version, ""I am Legend"" with Will Smith is also pretty good for a remake with the same story line."
5,classic si-fi,"classic si-fi with Charleston Heston,made in the early 80's still worth the time and effort to watch.. one of the all time greats, just remember this was 30 years ago.........."
4,Read the book!,If you like this movie ...you'll love the book...I Am Legend...also available thru Amazon.com
5,Memories . . .,"An outdated movie? Certainly, in terms of costuming and filming technique, Omega Man is showing it's age. But in terms of what the movie is about, it will never seem old - at least not to those of us who were young in the real world of the time. The issues addressed weighed heavily on the country - isolation, nuclear and bilogical threats, racial tensions that could only be addressed when times were so tough color didn't matter as much as being with another loving human being . . . wait - do those issues seem so far distant from what we live with in today's world. Only now, we've heard it all before - in movies, music, television, and print. Back then - this movie was one of the first to raise these questions and challenge us to consider the answers.For me, the Omega Man was a must own. I understand it may have been rushed to market to cash in on ""I Am Legend"", but, as my first BluRay experience, I wasn't dissappointed."
5,Superb Movie.,The Omega Man is great movie that takes place in the near future after biowarfare. Charle Heston is the only one who had the cure and the rest of the people are zombies. It's a good movie and I give it *Watches Woodstock five times.* FIVE STARS!
5,Chuck Heston at his best!,"Great 1970's sci-fi flick with my main main Chuck Heston thinking he is the last man on earth after chemical warfare with those damn commies!If you love 70's flicks like Nipsey does, You will love OMEGA MAN.Nipsey sez... OMEGA MAN is da BOMB!"
3,A campy classic,"What a campy classic! Cheesy, yet satisfying. Watch for the comparisons made between Charleton Heston and the Christian Messiah! Also, keep your eyes peeled in the opening shots for extra cars roaming the streets! There are at least two! From the cartoonish opening to the religious ending, it's a [mostly] delightfully silly [yet somewhat depressing] flick! And leagues beyond its anti-thesis ""Soylent Green."""
5,the omega man,"one of the best movies from Charlton Heston / only one word: OUTSTANDING / Mr. Heston's performance during this period and the type of movies made were quality assured. All the cast members deserve to be mention and thank for the JOB WELL DONE / and for the finest performances. I have all his movies (Go! Charlton Heston, GO!!!)"
3,OLD SCI-FI FLICK,"Omeaga Man is the fore runner of ""I am Legend"" and for the 70's is a pretty good flick. I saw it in the 70's and wanted to see if it was that good afterall these years. I enjoyed the film as most SCI-FI folks will"
3,Heston does it again!,A movie that tries to deal with what we are doing to this planet and ourselves and the consequences of our slide into nuclear dependancy and therfore nuclear accidents.
4,70's,"This film really shows its' age. Filmed in the 70's, it has the bad clothes and hair of the time. I did laugh when I heard the word ""honkey"" used. I hadn't heard that since the Jeffersons. This is very losely based on ""I Am Legend"". For a more pure version of the book, you will need to pick up ""The Last Man on Earth"" with Vincent Price. Heston is the real star of this movie. His performance is great as the last man on earth. Watching him unravel mentally was terrific. I wish they had spent more time with that aspect of the story before introducing other characters. All in all, it was a terrific story and worth purchasing."
2,It didn't come close to capturing the mood of I Am Legend,"It is no small wonder why Richard Matheson did not want his name associated with this film/novel. It is a poor adaptation of the original, and Charlton Heston fails to capture the thoughtful personality of Robert Neville, but instead brings arrogance to the role. END"
1,Disappointed,"Since I saw ""Last Man On Earth"" with the fabulous Vincent Price, I've loved it. I recently read the book, so I decided to watch this version of the story that was made later. I was thoroughly disappointed in it from the very beginning. Matheson, who wrote the novel said that this film was so far removed from his story, that it didn't even bother him. I can see why, if I hadn't aleady known that it was supposed to be based on the book, I'd have never have guessed it. The book is wonderful, I couldn't put it down, as is Last Man on Earth which was co-written by Matheson under a different name. I was very disappointed in this film. I highly recommend the book and previous film though. I'd leave this one on the shelf..."
2,cheesy,"Horrible acting, effects, and story. I don't really know how this is considered a sci-fi classic. I admit, I didn't read the book, so don't know how accurate it is or isn't. The premise is semi-plausible, and channels some of the fears that people had back then, but that's about all it does. Not really a deep movie that really explores anything. You can kinda understand the motivation of the ""enemy"", but it basically paints them as evil. And the protagonist is nominally the ""hero"", but doesn't really say anything to convince you of the ""right"" of the way he lives. Maybe that is the point. He is just trying to maintain his semblance of reality, which is the only thing important to him. Meh."
3,Good acting by Heston but movie still had problems,"I enjoyed the book ""I am Legend"" so I thought I would give this movie a try. As noted by other reviewers, it was only a very loose adaptation. It had its high points, and Heston did exceptionally well in the lead role. I nevertheless thought it was a bit overdone in places, and I hated the final scene where Heston's character seemed to be portrayed as Christlike. Anthony Zerbe was a brilliant actor, but his role in this movie seemed weak and the motives of his character seemed contrived to keep the story going. The older Italian-made movie with Vincent Price, ""The Last Man on Earth"" was much truer to the book and much more grimly realistic about portraying the anguish of what it would be like to be the only human being left on the planet."
3,"My Eyes,My Eyes...Take Flight ?","GUESTARBLOG OF THE MISSED !AIR COLLISION -- Either poking fun at disasters or takes itself `Way Too Serious' ?Stars: Reginald VelJohnson (DIE HARD) ,Jordan Ladd (BIRDS OF PREY) and Gerald Webb(Asylum Icon).Wow,No seriously,Umm...'Ouch' in the Air .When a studio loves their CGI this much,Got to tell ya `Back Off' on the `Showing Off Peeps !'.Was thrilled to see Andy Clemence,As the US President again,He should run this year...Next to Harrison Ford,Best President on a plane moments.Now,Jonathan Nation, You were mean and a bully and well,Your character was very,very bad.We really like,Dave Vescio,As the unusual passenger,Really.Umm, If We die on a plane,Don't cover my head and buckle me in next to the live people in coach, Please.Feeling,It's time to end this review,One last cast to hold up,Gerald Webb,'Damn Man',Finally a leading role,You get to grow as a character and get the girl...IN THIS FILM ?"
1,Awful Movie!,"I was more than upset with myself for making this puchase and in blu-ray no less! This ""film"" is a ghastly excuse for entertainment. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
3,If you like airplane crash movies....,"If you like airplane crash movies, this one is okay. Not great but not a waste of your time. Kind of cheesy at times buy okay."
1,got to be one of the worse movies ever,"Too many faults with the movie to list. The military rank was all wrong, a Captain in the army is not called Colonel and the ""Colonel"" was much too young to have ever reached that rank. Normally when a T-tail aircraft bumps it's tail against the bottom of another aircraft moving at high speed, the tail falls off. Glad I only paid $2.00 for the movie, it was incredibly awful."
1,Did they do that on purpose?,Its a sick planet when you can have millions of people starving in the world and millions can be spent making a movie like this. If I gave my baby sister a 1980's VHS recorder and sent her into the backyard I dont think she could have done much worse!!!
1,Plot okay,"This show has a good plot, but it is very low budget. I can only say it is watchable ! It was the normal cost for a new release, but the cost should have been half that."
3,Candy in a Box,Tasty but too tasty? Too much like candy for my purposes. If you are on a diet you might like these bars too much and find you want more than one...
1,bait and switch or....bait and steal,"I have a beef wiH these people. I ordered siX packs of these boxes as it says on the iTem description....andI only got ONE! ONE BOX!!! I contacted them and they told me I only ordered ONE box. So I asked them toread the posted AMAZON description of the items for sale...and they told me....get a hold of this! That theorder, MY order was for one 6 pack of Special K snack bar!!!! THAT aMAZON HAD HAD THE DESCRIPTION WRONG! If that is right who on earth would pay $11.98 for one six snack bar pack? that is like you guys out there paying the $23.00+ for ONE box of these snacks ... BUYER, BEWARE!"
2,only 4 grams of protien,"I thought this was a really great deal, but its not. This box is only 4 grams per bar, the smaller bars."
1,"special k ""protein"" bar vs. kashi","the special k ""protein"" bar is a joke. in comparison with a kashi bar (which in my opinion tastes as good if not better)..here is what you're getting with the special k bar:40 more calories, for only 3 extra grams of proteinnot to mention:10 extra grams of sugar6 more grams of carbsand3 more grams of SATURATED fatconsumers need to start reading and comparing labels, instead of going by the name brands"
4,Tastes great,I purchased this product because I like to have a little protein in me before my morning walk. It is delicious.
1,False advertising,"Calling this a ""Protein Snack Bar"" is bordering on fraud. It has four times as many grams of carbohydrates as protein. This is actually a ""Carbohydrate Snack Bar"", otherwise known as a candybar."
3,"Tiny, not that good for you but taste good","Beware how tiny these are. I didn't read that part and was stunned how small and light when I received them. I had to eat 3 to satisfy my snack craving and by then, the sugar and carb count went through the roof. These are not healthy bars and not great for you. Sure, they have a little protein but what else? Sugar, carbs, virtually no fiber..find your health bar somewhere else. They taste good but don't assume these things even compare in size to any snack bar out there. The smallness makes these more expensive as well."
5,Fascinating,"I was fascinated by this look at the arrival of the colonists on Pern, and how they created the dragons as a defense against threadfall. It was interesting to read about the people that the Holds and Weyrs of Pern are named for."
4,Solid Pern Storyline,"Dragonsdawn is one of a line of books centered around the original trilogy based on Pern. Anne McCaffrey does a good job explaining the origins of humans on Pern, and what many of the ""missing"" capabilities that their ancestors miss so much actually are. Although this is the most science-fictiony of her Pern books, it by no means gets mired in the details. The book is much more character and plot oriented than technology oriented. Although many things are explained in this book, there are still some mysteries to keep the readers guessing."
4,"Dragonsdawn, aptly named as it is about the dawn of Pern.","Dragonsdawn, a story about the beginnings of the settlers ofPern. As very good story, it practically explains everythingthat you might wonder about in relation to the culture ofPern. Everything from where they get the names of the Holdsto how the magestic dragons came about. A very good storyas well as a definite must see for anyone who has read anyother of the Pern series."
2,Not My Favorite,"I have read some of Anne McCaffrey's other books, and I thought that they were pretty good. Not the case with this one. It seems like I'm the only one that thinks this book was awful, but I just didn't like it.I thought that the story did help clear up some of the Pern ""mysteries"" of the ancestors, but I was constantly being averted by the numerous swear words and nasty scenes that I won't mention right now. :-) I understand that some of them may have been affected by living on a ""corrupt"" Earth, but I really didn't want to hear that. This book has caused my respect for the series to downslide somewhat. I believe that the same effect may be reached without the above mentioned, and yet still not be classified as a little kid's book."
2,"What's all the fuss about, anyway?","I saw the Dragonriders of Pern series in the SF and Fantasy Top 100 list, and since the book was both SF and fantasy, my two favorite genres, I snapped it up when I saw the book in the bookstore.(Enlish titles are hard to come by here, anyway.)And then I read it. And then I realized that not all books are good merely for being science fiction or fantasy, or even science fiction and fantasy at the same time. The whole book is about how resourceful, loving, and noble Sean and Sorka are, what an (unbelievably) evil slut Bitra is, what great leaders Benden and Boll are, and so on. The author's obsession with detail, which would have been pleasing in many other books, make reading this book laborious work. Phew! The other Pern book at the bookstore, Dragonquest or whatever, is about the same. What are all these people, reincarnations or something? First novel where I counted the remaining pages while I read."
4,"Anne McCaffrey ""Dragonsdawn""",I bought this book for my wife as a Christmas gift and she loves it. The book is in excellent shape and came to us in a timely manner. Thank you.
1,Rehash,"The villains are overstated and the other characters are bland. The opening is without interest and slow. The best scene is the discovery of fire lizards and even that is repeating an event from a previous book.To be fair, the author has a difficult task in front of her. Her previous books, set in a later era of Pern, contain many references to the the founding of Pern. Now, writing the ""first"" book, she is left with the task of connecting her dots and making a story out of them. This isn't her best work, but she manages a credible story that may be more enjoyable to those who have not read so much of the Pern series as I have."
5,One of the best,I read just about all of the Pern books. This was a must for Anne Mccaffery to write. It explains so much about the way Dragons came about and how all the Wyers and holds were named. I plane to read it again.
5,Your collection is NOT complete without this book!,"I'll tell you now, I'll probably have to get a new copy of this book because I've read it so many times the cover is falling off! It is a must have for all true McCaffrey and Pern fans! If you don't have it as part of your collection please GET IT! You don't know what your missing!"
4,Excellent reading if you want everything explaining.,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Dragonsdawn, the characters were warm and inviting, and you felt as though you knew them by the end. I have read all of the Dragonriders books and this rates up there with the best, although I think for us die hard fans, it may be a case of reading anything which says Pern in the first paragraph, even if it were on the back of the cornflakes. Some fans may find it annoying having everything explained and if you want to leave things to the imagination , then don't read it, because it shatters a lot of illusions of the medievel land we were first introduced to in Dragonflight, which was where it all began 38 years ago. But, at the end of the day, its 100 times better than Renegades, which was dire. But is not up there with the White Dragon, which was 10 stars, or All the Weyrs of Pern. Happy reading"
4,fun fantasy book,"A great book for young teens or for adults who just want to relax. Well worth the price, I now look forward to the entire series."
4,Chronicles of Pern,"After many years I have re-discovered Anne McCaffrey's Pern novels, and I am enjoying them as much as I ever did. Whether a new read or a re-read the stories are wonderfully vibrant"
1,420 Pages of Chatter,"This book was a terrible drag to me. Not only is the plot very slow, but it's also unbalanced in a sense that AMC procrastinates pages after pages on irrelevant points and quickly bundles up essential matters in a few sentences. For example, results of essential conversations are reported in three sentences instead of providing the conversation itself. The same occurs with the experiences with Dragons, or with the death of some characters.Then it makes the book complicated to read because you can't predict what you can safely skip... After a while, you get frustrated and end up skipping paragraphs because you just don't care about anyone any more. Never mind who is who and who does what.Eventually, less than 10 pages out of 420 remain in my mind. A pretty bad score, indeed."
1,Her worst book (and I'll tell you why),"This was McCaffrey's worst book (okay, Renegades did suck worse), and the reason is that it destroys all the thrill of discovery that we felt all through the first three books and the rest of the series. The ""ancients"" are revealed to be boring, stiff characters not half as interesting as the best of her 2nd string characters. The ""main characters"" are stupid and allow themselves to be duped, the evil characters are way too evil, and it basically takes much of the magic of the series away. All this history is meant to be subtle, to be something you think about after you put the book down -- but it's just a lot of dreck. It offers nothing that we didn't know, but a lot of flat, boring characters named Benden, Bitra and so on, and does nothing good. Please, do NOT read this book. Spend time with your kids instead."
2,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"ALLRIGHT, THIS IS THE FIRST PERN BOOK THAT I'V READ, (AND PROBABLY THE LAST,) SO I MAY NOT HAVE PICKED UP ON ALL THE FORESHADOWING TO LATER BOOKS OR SOMETHING, BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS PRETTY BORING. ACTUALLY I THOUGHT THE BEGINNING WAS PRETTY GOOD(HENCE THE TWO STARS INSTEAD OF ONE) BUT IT RAPIDLY DEGENERATED TO A COMBINATION UNIMAGINATIVE FANTASY, LAUGHABLE ATTEMPT AT SCI-FI, AND A SOAP OPERA.AFTER ALL THE HIPE THESE PERN BOOKS HAVE BEEN RECEIVING I EXPECTED MUCH BETTER. FOR A BOOK WITH A REALLY GOOD PLOT I WOULD RECOMMEND TOLKEINS LORD OF THE RINGS OR ROBERT JORDANS WHEEL OF TIME, OR FOR SCI-FI, ISAAC ASIMOVS THE ROBOT SERIES."
4,Dawn for the dragons,Though I do not love Anne McCaffrey I am beginning to like her just a little.I read the Harpor Hall trilogy 1st and to some that would be a mistake but thats where my taste lies.Dragonsdawn is a good book.If you love fire-lizards its a good read.It kinda lets you into the dragons world little by little until you feel at home.Because of this book I want to read more not only of the fire-lizards but of the dragons themselfes and their bonded.The charachters are well written and I did cry twice to my surprise as I read the book.I got attached to the characters...Now my only problem is what is next after this book?...hehehe
4,To prevent confusion,"I highly recommend this book as a useful prequel to the Dragonriders of Pern series. By giving a background for how the world was colonized and how the dragons came to be, otherwise confusing terminology is introduced gradually, so that by the main series it's not something to stumble over."
5,Another amazing accomplishment,"I cannot emphasize how much I love Anne McCaffrey's work. Dragonsdawn is a touching and amazing view of the first people on Pern and the creation of the dragons. The blend between science and fiction was perfect. I greatly enjoyed the genetic engineering (I'm minoring in BioMedical Engineering) and the honest look at how easily things can go wrong when trying to play with genes and with creatures' natures. An absolutely marvelous book, once again from McCaffrey."
4,Pern with a little more science fiction spin,"I enjoyed this book very much. It combines the fantasy charm and character development of the best of the other Pern books with more of a standard ""Science Fiction"" feel due to the higher tech action of the colonists arriving in their space ships. I personally found it a felicitous combination. When I read this, I had already read the Dragonriders and Harper Hall trilogys, as well as Moreta, Dragonlady of Pern, and it was fascinating to go back in time to the original settlers and learn how dragons came to be. However, this could also be a good introduction to Pern for someone who had never read anything in the series."
5,Excellent re-read,"I've read this book before when it was first released. I decided to re-read the series in chronological order so started here. I have to say I enjoyed it more the second time around, although it's been over a decade since I first read it. Excellent story and Chronicles of Pern: First Fall makes a great follow up. Binding was very good, an off white color which surprised me and the bond has a rough finish to it, kinda nice."
5,Read Dragonsinger 1st!,"I recommend for you to start with the harper hall series. Dragonsinger, dragonsong, dragondrums. Or read the Lessa series (dragonquest, the white dragon, etc) first. This is a book for when you can't get enough of Pern and you want to know more! There is also a Dragonlover's guide to Pern book for those of us who love Pern. It has recipes for Klah and bubbly pies! (I have tried the bubbly pies and they turned out good!)"
5,Great Book!!,"A must read for dragon fanatics... combining the magic of dragons with science. This is where it all began, and particularly good for someone who started with other books in the series. If you've read the others, pay attention when you read this, and you'll pick up on some good puns...!"
5,I can see clearly now the history's here,"Benden Weyr - Admiral Benden, Telgar hold - Telgar (in memory of Sallah). This opens my eyes and is thoroughly brilliant, I reckon that some of the above reveiws have small minds and even smaller imaginations. I believe this to be among her best work, it is fast and exciting allong with the real threat of thread. It is a lengthey version of the history bit they give you at the beginning of the other books. It shows you how they made the dragons and how one woman's genious saved an entire colony. I love this book and the Chronicles, the best Sci-fi/Fantasy books concerning dragons written ever."
3,"Good, but Too Many Loose Ends","First, I'm impressed with the technical thought that went into this book. The merging of space technology with a basically primitive planet could not have been easy, and I think it was done well. The plot that's weaved in and among these details, as a group of people from an advanced civilization try to make a new home on a world nothing like the one they left, quickly drew me in and kept me reading.My biggest problem with this book, though, is the number of things that were started, but never finished. Some of them are important, and some of them aren't, but there are enough to make me wonder. Perhaps they're answered in other books I haven't read; but if so, the author must surely understand that not everyone has read every book in the series.This book is a must for die-hards, but can be taken or left for others."
4,my favorite in the Pern story,"I've read this book many times, one of my Anne McCaffrey favorites. the Kindle edition was well presented and a nice way to re-read it."
5,Great Product,"Great price for a quality product,. Performs and meets or exceeds all OEM specifications, I would definitely recommend this to others."
3,question,"whats the diff between part item 4957 and 4958? it seems like both are the same product. are they manufactured with different materials, or made at different times?"
5,Great value and all the socket adapters you'll ever need.,"Fits great and the sorted sizes work perfectly to attach sockets and ratchets with sizes 1/4"", 3/8"", 1/2"" in every possible combination."
4,works but not for heavy duty,"Good product, but you cannot use for heavy duty.... I would say not over 150 ft/lb... I tried to use it to unsrew a very tight bolt that is most likely over 150 ft/lb in my car, and it broke.... I think it's a good product, but I probably used it passed its specificactions... overall good product, a bit surprised that it broke though..."
5,Tekton Impact adapters,Must have set of adapters for impact tools or regular tools. I've had to use these frequently when I cant find the right socket. ;)
1,Gusus is not Gus Gus,"Amazon totally blew this one. I really like the band called Gus Gus, so I entered Gus Gus in a search and found several albums. I ordered about 5 and when they came, one was obviously not Gus Gus, even though it shows up right in the middle of the search list for Gus Gus. It is a band called Gusus, made in Japan and it is horrible. Easy mistake to make, I had to read it several times before I realized what had happened. Amazon made the same mistake, and since there were no reviews on Gusus, I didn't pick-up on it.It is heavy metal with a male screamer....good for some, not good for me.Amazon, you need to remove the entry from the Gus Gus list!P.S. This is my first negative experience with Amazon, so I don't want to give the wrong idea. This is just one small error and other than this, I have had all great experiences on this site."
2,Boring,"Really disappointed. Did not hear anything new or interesting on the subject and the ""investigators"" were stilted and also boring."
4,Great cheap version of the Borgia Codex,"Be warned that you must compare the images from this reproduction to the original, for three reasons: 1) sometimes the authors of this reproduction use colors that do not match the original codex, 2) sometimes the authors of this reproduction place the wrong imagery in the reproduction, for example a monkey's head instead of a humans head, and 3)Sometimes the authors speculate as to what might have been on a page and they use their own judgment, which might be wrong.Other than that, this is a great reproduction of the Borgia codex. It is cheap, it is light and it is well made. Another thing to keep in mind, the codex borgia is read left to right, this reproduction was printed right to left, so it forces you to read the codex in the wrong direction.Look at the ""plate number"" and the page number in the book, they do not match. Also notice that the plate number is in descending order."
5,The Other 5 Star Reviews are Right,"I will not go over their 5 star comments except to say that I agree. The amazingly colourful and crisp art in this short book is rivetting. As much as one may credit the reknowned author, deep congratulations should also go to the publisher for a masterful print job."
5,Back Cover Copy,"This is the new edition of America's most trusted baby book - the one that has helped over 2.5 million new parents. It is practical, authoritative and unique to any other baby book. It is actually three books in one...a prenatal book, a child care manual, and a personal record book.This review refers to the 1973 edition."
4,Dholak,"We really like the dholak that we ordered from Amazon.com. It has a nice beat to it. The only concern I have is what happens if you tighten the screws too much. Otherwise, it seems to be of good quality."
3,DVD quality poor...Actual Movie Excellent.,A beautiful and gripping story is marred by the use of poor movie print when transferred to DVD. I would have to believe there is a better copy of the movie available to transfer to DVD. A five star movie is reduced to 3 stars by the poor DVD.
2,great film ruined by bad transfer,"I agree with most of reviewer here that Roberto Rossellini's Open City is a great film - ground-breaking work that is yet entertaining in the most simple way. However, it appears that most of the reviewers refer to the VHS version. I bought this DVD the moment I heard that it was on DVD, and am much disappointed. Overall transfer is substandard, subtitles miss a bulk of dialogues, and most of all, there is at least one missing shot that I noticed in this transfer (It is the famous shot in which the resistant is being tortured by blowtorch). I had VHS released by Connoisseur, which is superior to this DVD on every level.So buy VHS or better yet tell Image to restore this gem."
2,a great film ruined by bad transfer,"I agree with many reviewers here that this is truly a great film. Someone mentioned that the story is melodramatic or even propagandistic, which is true, but it is really beside the point in this case. What is important here is how the simple story is told in even simpler way in this ground-breaking film, transporting the viewers to the breathtaking moments of last days of WWII in Rome. However, I think many reviews actually refer to VHS version because DVD (released by Image, I think, from Blackwell Films) is even worse than VHS (released by Connoisseur). I bought this title as soon as I heard it was on DVD, and I was much disappointed to say the least. The transfer is substandard in overall, subtitles miss whole bulk of dialogues, and most of all, there is even a missing shot from the film (It is the famous shot in which the resistant is being tortured with torchblow). My advice is: Buy VHS (Connoisseur one), or better yet ask Image for new restored release."
3,Rossellini's Breakthrough,"Italian film owes much to Roberto Rossellini. World film owes him more than he's worth, I'm afraid. Made under some of the most impoverished conditions an underground film ever had to face, Rome Open City has its moments of almost ""documentary"" realness. But then Rossellini had to tell a hopelessly melodramatic story of partisans betrayed by faithless women (most assuredly not Anna Magnani!) tortured by Nazis without betraying a single comrade, while an Italian priest watches over it all like Edmond O'Brien and invokes the wrath of God on the Germans. Far less ""neo-realist"" than propagandistic. Yet Rossellini got a career (and Ingrid Bergman) out of it."
2,mediocre piece of realist propaganda,"A mediocre piece of realist propaganda, now elevated to the ranks of ""film greats"" because of its conformity to certain techniques of the era, this film has nothing to offer except rigid, cliched ""villains"" (the Germans) and the ""noble born oppressed"" (Italians). It is sentimentalizing at its worse, I particularly found the portrayal of the German commander weak, as he looked like a gerbil, and did not seem very apt or capable. There is very little in the way of story and the expected brutality of the Germans is what takes up the greater part of the screen time, how predictable."
3,Works fine,"The above reviewer must not have known what this tool was for. I purchased it and it worked fine for notching tile to fit around shower valves. It is obviously not for cutting tiles. My only complaint is that the Diamond wire does not seem to be available separately. I broke mine after about 6 tiles, or an hour of continuous use. If you are a homeowner looking for a single use tool, this would be fine."
1,Didn't work at all,"I'm tiling my bathroom and thought this would be helpful. The drill bit is very cheap metal wouldn't make the least dent in the tile I was using. In fact, I flattened the end of the drill bit trying. And the saw blade wouldn't cut the tile either. Maybe it needs ...what ...softer tile? Good grief - this is just junk."
1,Not worth the purchase,"The product looked dirty when arrived. It broke immediately on the first use, could not support the weight.. not well built"
2,"OK, But Has Weak Spots","The first Glass Hammer CD I got was On to Evermore, which is pretty good. Then I got Perelandra. The keyboards are very good and so are a few of the tunes. But the vocals are a bit weak in places, and whoever or whatever is doing the drumming needs big-time improvement. Also, the tunes are not strong across the whole album. This album lacks fire/pizzazz/excitement, unless you are excited solely by fast keyboard runs."
4,The Search is Over,"Finally, a band that has something artistically original and compelling to say. Although I like Dream Theater, I'm tired of hearing every new ""progressive"" band labeled as the next DT. Glass Hammer creates a veritable wall of sound. Lush orchestration, inspiring lyrics and bold musicianship drive this album, beginning with Time Marches On. That tune helped me re-visit the spiraling keyboard sounds of the latter 70s and 80s. If you are looking for something new, take a chance on this album -- it's well worth it."
5,ITS UNDERATED BADLY,"After seeing so few stars and reading ordinary reviewsI braced myself expecting the worst while waitng for thisCD to turn up in the mail. When it did I placed it into my lucky CD playerand it began to happen , LUSH BEAUTY COMPLEX ENGAGING It has all of the vintage more classic trates with some modernideas GET THIS CD."
4,glass hammer is fantastic,"Literally, Glass Harp is fantastic, that is, they put into music some of the greatest fantasy fiction of all time. From Tolkien's Lord of the Rings to Lewis' Space Trilogy, Glass Harp is well-read. Only Glass Harp, with their progressive-style rock could pull this album off. It is a masterpiece; truly a magnum opus. One can actually feel oneself take off from earth like a ""starship trooper"" in the opening cut (like Ransom is in the first book of the Space Trilogy). There are many progressive tunes on this album with many soaring synth solos, and divers key and time signiture changes. Also, in the vein of their previous album Journey of the Dunedan, they include several eerie dramas in between songs. Also the addition of Michelle Young on vocals really adds a new dimension to the group. And to top it all, Glass Harp includes their great ballad ""the way to her heart"" (also on Journey of the Dunedan). All in all, this is a great cd."
3,"Fun movie with a ""right on!"" ending","Some times you just want to watch a movie that is fun, the good guys are likeable, and the bad ""guy"" is fun to dislike. This is one to watch."
3,"Working Girl, dvd","This is the story of an employee who is kept at the bottom of the corporate chain, as a secretary. Her ideas are taken by her boss, and passed off as her own. The secretary steps outside her group and runs an idea. Sigourney Weaver is good as the villainous squelcher. Melanie Griffith is good as the ""take this job and shove it"" secretary. Harrison Ford is always good as the romantic interest, of both women. Retribution is swift, but honesty conquers in the end."
5,Great Motivational Flick,"I could watch this movie over and over again. It's a great pick me up movie, that has withstood the changes in time. I find it particularly fitting in today's shaky economy. In the end, the girl gets what she wants, and doesn't wait for things to happen. Great all star cast. Humorous."
4,"Entertaining, even for today","Ahh, I enjoy a good come-up story, even though this one could only happen and succeed in Hollywood. Besides looking at the big hair and shoulder pads, the movie told a touching story - one that many of us could relate to. I enjoy seeing it when the evil boss gets her comeuppance...if only it happened in real life too. But since when do co-workers applaud your success and look out for you?I was surprised to seeing Melanie Griffith looking fresh-faced and pretty, hard to believe since she looks so bloated and old now. Sigourney Weaver gave a believable performance.Entertaining film, if only all life changes and social climbing were so quick."
4,"Sly, Funny and Romantic!","This film takes a gritty look at men and women in the working environment who will do anything to climb the corporate ladder. Melanie Griffith is charming and has her best roleas the ditzy but smart secretary. Sugourney Weaver is also a lot of fun to watch as Griffith's slimy boss who steals her idea. Harrison Ford is also great and makes a great transgression into light comedy. Alec Baldwin, Oliver Platt and especially Joan Cusack are superb. Also this film is one of the few who captures all the glamour and feel of the 80's. A terrific cast and a charming story make this one extremely enjoyable. Maybe not artistically valuable but a lot of fun. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!"
4,Feel-good fairy tale,"I don't mean a fairy tale in the sense of impossibility or implausibility - adults everywhere are going back to school to get ahead in their lives. I do mean that Cinderella-like quality about Tess (Melanie Griffith), who's swept away from her life as harried office drudge to rising star of the business world. I especially like that she did it herself, with her prince charming (Jack, played by Harrison Ford) helpful and supportive but clearly not the one doing the hard part. And I don't ignore the catty delight to be had in seeing Tess unwittingly steal Jack from the evil stepmother/boss Katharine (Sigourney Weaver).Among many other things, Tess does a great job of showing what it's like to grow into one's success when it comes so suddenly. She almost feels like an interloper, like a little girl caught trying on mommy's shoes - only to find out that they fit quite well.-- wiredweird"
1,Working Girl REGION ERROR,"Unfortunately you shipped me a Region 1 version when I am clearly in UK, Region2. you then shipped a FOC replacement, again Region1 you then offered me a refund if I paid to ship them back to you, as I have not been able to view either copy and cannot give you a better ""review"" !"
4,Working Girl Review,"A fun movie. You always see it on TV, but it's cut. Here's an opportunity to watch the original version. Very entertaining."
5,What's not to like?,"This movie has it all - charm, suspense, comedy, and Harrison Ford - all wrapped up in a great movie that you can watch over and over. Harrison Ford gets caught between two women of the corporate world. His heart leads him to love one while his head tells him to do what is best for the company. Lucky for him it happens to be the same woman!"
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:One of the most dated movies I can think of and a thoroughly overrated piece of filmmaking that somehow scored Melanie Griffith an Oscar nomination for her grating, word-by-word line readings, Working Girl is only of interest for people with misguided 80s nostalgia or very strong feminism."
5,goes to show ever body wants to make it somewhere.....,"A Classic'Working Girl' is a classic. The villian, Ms. Weaver, is both deliciously evil as well as scarily realistic. Harrison Ford is excellent as the white knight, with a good mix of Wasp entitlement and sweaty armpits. This is before his acting slid to just staring lost at the screen for various lengths of time to convey different emotions. The movie brings me to the verge of tears at least three times and the ending is beautiful. The soundtrack, featuring Carly Simon and the St. Thomas boys choir, is sublime. When 'Let the River Run' hits as the camera pulls away from Melanie within her new office in the World Trade Center you can only wish that life is that fair."
5,The Ultimate Fantasy,"Who wouldn't like to put their two-faced, egotistical, back-stabbing liar of a boss in his or her place? In ""Working Girl"" we get the chance to live vicariously through Tess (Melanie Griffith) as she initially trusts her boss (Sigourney Weaver) to be on her side, learns of her boss's duplicity and deceit, and then sets out to get what she wants behind her boss's back. You will be cheering for Tess by the end. Way to go, Tess!"
5,Fresh ideas for enhancing a home's appearance,"Curb Appeal: Exciting Ways To Enhance The Appearance Of Your Home provides fascinating before-and-after photos to show how changes in paint, decoration and landscaping can create a new look to a tired home. Fifteen projects are geared to the do-it-yourself homeowner, from fences to outdoor lighting and trim, and provide fresh ideas for enhancing a home's appearance."
2,Was hoping for more how-to...,"I was left wanting more how-to and less 'here are some pictures'. What I really want is a book that illustrates an idea, and then gives you details about the hardscape, construction, plant species, etc. to execute that landscape project. This book is about 80% pictures and ideas, 20% improvement how-tos that don't really seem to have anything to do with the first 4/5s of the book and look like they were cut out of sections of three other books and pasted into this one. For a relatively inexpensive book that might give you some ideas, it is okay, but if you get ideas from this book, you are on your own to figure out how to actually execute them."
2,Not what I was looking for.,"I was looking for a book with lots of before and after photos to give me ideas on changing the faade and landscaping of different types of houses. While this is a beautifully photographed book, it wasn't what I was looking for. I found better material in the Sunset book."
5,"Beautiful book, lots of ideas","This is a beautiful book with fabulous pictures and something for everyone. I'm no landscaper or gardener, so I really appreciate the creative work of those that are. Having your home look breathtaking from the sidewalk is so essential, not only if you want to sell your home, but just for your own enjoyment and that of your neighbors. I love the variety and it has inspired me to take another look at my own home. Great job."
4,Curb aprove,"What i realyy wanted to know before I purchase the book, was did it have a little section of how too created more less some of the gardens that werein the book. The pictures were great and it does help, you do look at your landscape in a whole different way. I have been abel to take different landscape fronm the books I order too start lanscaping my from lawn."
1,not good,"I have this video and it has some inaccuracies, especially about the Egyptians. It says how evil the ancients were, although shortly before Musa, the prophet Joseph (Yusuf) was second in command and was greatly respected by all of Egypt and the Pharaoh of his time. It also made it look as if the ancients did not do anything on their own and depended on the hebrew slaves for everything, and of course this is completely false, and the Pyramids were not built by slaves, as the video tries to imply. The animation is also not good, and I did not like it. The rest of the storyline is pretty accurate and follows the Qur'an, but it is not something I would recommend. The quality is no good."
3,Ping Pong Static,"The broadcast know how to use static, and white noise better than most acts; not only do they rely on noise to creat atmosophere but also to create a beat.Tender Buttons is a definite experiment for Broadcast, how much farther could they take noise and keep it dancey/listenable. The overall album falls prey to it's own ambitions occasionally, especially in comparison to the over-all well versed and paced Noise Made By People or Pendulum. If you are a fan of Broadcast, than you must join them to continue on this path of new sounds and you will be rewarded. But if this is your first time to Broadcast territory, you may want to grab Ha Ha Sound or The Noise Made By People albums first."
2,That special sound is gone!,Im always for experimentation and i guess Broadcast could do no better than their first two amazing unique stellar albums on warp. Tender Buttons has 3 or 4 songs i liked but the rest was not only lacking their usually ghostly sound but the loss of their excellent live jazzy lounge drummer is the end of this band in my opinion. In many cases a drummer can make or break a band and though the female singer Trish and songwriter are left theyve lost that special something they had. Annoying drum machines clatter away synths sequenced to simplistic motifs- fragments of songs that in the past were carried by unique arrangements falter under the sound of what i guess was hip in electronica a few years ago. For the uninitiated- please get Noise made by People and HAHA Sound- two of the most original and special records from the last ten years.
1,"be sure to give this a listen, first.","I've liked and followed Broadcast since their first release. I was -really- disappointed with this release. I Found The End, Goodbye Girls, Corporeal, and Tears in the Typing Pool are the only listenable tracks, in my opinion. Others, like Black Cat are infurtiatingly bad.Tender Buttons is a big disappointment after HaHa Sound."
2,it's time to give it up,"well this is definitely the worst one they've put out. when you lose half your members, either replace em, or quit. man what a letdown!"
5,"Broadcast is the best ever times 47,000","I really love this album. It marks the a change for Broadcast, as its mostly recorded without the live drumming that is a big part of their prior releases. Black Cat is catchy and powerful. Tender Buttons is hypnotic and soothing. America's Boy features really awesome dirty keyboards. Tears in the Typing Pool is poetic. Corporeal is good but has pretty strange lyrics. Bit 35, Arc of journey are okay. Michael A Grammar is oddly catchy. And, it goes on. Another masterpiece from probably the greatest band ever."
5,My daughter LOVES this game!,"My 9 year-old son and my 3 year-old daughter both love this game. They play it together taking turns with different parts of it. My daughter still needs help in the store making change to buy the different clothes and some times will get frustrated when adding ingredients to make the recipes, but luckily her big brother helps her with this part. It isn't difficult, but you need to be able to count things out. The recipes ask for 3 eggs, etc so all you need to do is find the group of eggs (and there is exactly the amount the recipe asks for) and drag them into the mixing bowl. This game has several different things to do in it, both fun and educational. It is also set up like a story book so you go through different pages and click on certain objects and they do funny things. The kids LOVE that!"
1,CD Compatibility,"Arthurs Computer Adventure Ages 3-7 CD software is not compatible with my Windows XP software, even though the package states it is compatible!Even the readme file did not explain, and was written for Windows 95 & 98! Therefore, it lies on the shelf, totally unusable."
1,Not compatible on new Mac's (with Intel processors),"This is advertised as being Mac compatible, but unless your Mac is very old, it will not work."
1,Is it good? I don't know!,"I don't know if this is any good or not. It will not run on Windows Vista, nor Windows XP. It apparently is for some earlier outdated operating system!! But they don't tell you that! It is up to you to find out about this only after purchasing this software!"
1,Not very educational,"I bought this software after reading the reviews. Yes, this game is fun and my sons love to play it. But, that is all it is. Mostly they are just games. We have many other software titles where the children are always learning when they are playing. My children want to play this game. However, I want my children to use the computer as a learning tool, not a gameboy."
1,DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS XP!!!,"No idea if it's any good b/c though it says it works with Windows XP, as several others have also said, it does not, it crashes the system repeatedly."
2,arthur,although it said it was compatable it never loaded so we have no clue what it actually teaches or does
1,Software doesn't work with Vista,This Arthur's Adventure software does NOT work with Windows Vista. Will not install. So don't buy it if you have Vista.
1,Only runs on OS 9 - will not run in classic mode on any modern MAC,"To work this software, you need MAC OS 9. It would not run on My Mac from 2005 - that had OS X. Complex process to install OS 9 classic, for a $6 game. :-("
2,"Promising title, disappointing DVD.","First, the technicalities. The interviewed people responds in various languages, e.g. Spanish (with Argentinian accent) or Korean. The problem was that the subtitles did not work at all, which made it difficult to understand, and thus frustrating! Maybe the DVD I bought was the only defectious one, who knows.Second, I was disappointed because of the content. I expected a more in-depth analysis of the side effects of globalization.I give it 2 stars only because of the activism behind the movie."
2,Not the quality I expected,"If you are seeking a good quality then do not expect that this will be the product to buy. For the cost you pay, it may be OK, but personally I prefer to pay some extra and get a better product like Dura-Stick II Electrotherapy Electrodes, it cost almost double, but defiantly it is much betterBeware that the adhesive conducting layer is not good at all and that will limit the number of times you use it.Also, the shipping price is so expensive - but it is also expensive on the other product I am suggesting to use."
2,Not very good adhesive.,"You have to replace them quite often, because of the adhesive. In the other hand, good conductivity."
3,"Not horrible, not great","Those who say these are the best TENS pads ever, I don't think they've ever used a good TENS pad to know better, 'cause these aren't the best, or even close to it. They aren't horrible, and they work okay the first couple of times, but after that, the gel really breaks down. For me, that wasn't a big deal, since I had some electrode gel on hand to use to re-gel them. I think for the hassle, and for the cost, I'd rather get something a little more expensive that work better and stick and gel better.Plus, I'm not sure what the black bag in the picture is, because the pads came in the mail in simple plastic bags, with no writing or anything else on them."
1,Don't buy it.,The metal stem comes off the glass during the first hand-washing and it seems nearly impossible to get it back on using clear glue. I am very disappointed and would never have bought this item if I knew this would happen.
2,CHUPACABRA TERROR meets PUMPKINHEAD,"Some palentologists and forest rangers go into the woods, disturb an ancient Bigfoot burial grounds(You heard me. Bigfoot Burial Grounds) and end up being chased out of the imediate area by a pack of PO'd Cgi Bigfeet.I'll admit, some the acting is pretty darn good, but they're given a crappy script to work with, and the effects look like something out a video game.Overall, this is a fairly cruddy movie that never gets good until the last 5 minutes. Wait for it to come on Tv if you must see it."
2,Why Do We All Rent These Kinda Movies?,"All of us have rented a B grade movie once or twice.May learn the leason right away DON'T RENT OR BUY THEM.This is that case.The story in general was good, the characters seemed so fake.Not a single character acted with good emotions.Itseems like a late 70's early 80's horror film,slow pace few people get killed off here there.Then it hits them everyone has to flee to survive.The CGI was flat out terrable.It seemed like high school nerds could assemble this with little talent neccasary."
2,OK MOVIE,"this movie wasn't all that bad. bad acting and a bad script aside, this movie was not that bad. it's a pretty good monster movie that kept me watching all the way through. i wouldn't buy it, but it's worth renting."
1,Bigfoot is a serial killer,"Reasonably watchable Bigfoot film. It's basically a serial killer movie with Bigfoot as the killer. It has some funny dialogue, but the entire film just bored me terribly. For the sake of the review I did finish watching it. Apparently, many other reviewers found something to like here, I was not able to find it. Beyond the stale plot lines, sometimes funny dialog, and boring premise (you know, a bunch of campers go to the woods and get hacked up by a machete weilding maniac, oops, I mean a big hairy multi-clawed bipedal maniac), I just felt it was boring."
2,Why can't I find a good Bigfoot movie,"The idea sounded good, a group of people in the woods being stalked by a bigfoot, but the acting sucked and the night time scenes are impossible to follow. You can't tell who is who. I'd skip it."
2,very bad!,"This was a terrible movie the specil effects were bad,the acting was bad,the the only reason i gave it two stars beacuse giveing it one star will be kinda harsh."
2,wrong product,I thought this would fit my 5555 Ipaq but doesn't. I was mislead by the description. Haven't used it
1,This Trifold is for an older model of HP Ipaq PDA,This is for an older model of HP Ipaq PDA is not usefull for me
2,Not for most iPAQs,"This case will not work with most iPAQ PDAs because it is designed for iPAQs with a side hinging cover. The case actually attaches to the hinge of the cover, thereby replacing whatever cover was on the PDA. Unfortunately, my hx2755 has a cover that hinges from the top, so this case won't really work for it. Its a tight squeeze with the cover attached for my PDA to fit, but it does have some room for a few credit cards and maybe some SD cards."
2,Horrible Quality,"I find it odd that it's shot from like 4-5 rows behind people. It looks like it was shot on a digital camera and never actually edited. I'm at least glad it has a DVD menu. To be honest, I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone."
2,Undistinguished in any way,"I purchased this book, in part, because of it's excellent reviews on Amazon. Although the authors obviously did a considerable amount of research for this project, the book as a whole seemed to me rather tedious, with an overwhelming number of characters who contributed little to the final outcome. Although the liberation of Paris was a momentous event and is depicted well in the final chapters, I think a more profitable line of pursuit would have been to examine the critical miscalculations made by Hitler which resulted in the loss of Paris for the German army, or morale among the Germans as the European campaign collapsed. As such , the book offers little in the way of insight into these events, and this, I believe, is its greatest weakness."
4,Great story,"Great story of how Paris survived the second world war. Condition of the Book was great from Denver Savation Army store. If you like to read about the second world war, this is very well written."
5,is paris burning,"recommended by a friend, haven't read it, bought it as a gift and haven't given it to the recipient yet"
4,Insightful!,"The recipe for success isn't so tough to figure out, writes financial entrepreneur Charles Patrick Garcia. Start with a heaping helping of passion, then mix in equal parts hard work, integrity, belief and positive attitude. The quality of the final dish resides in the details, of course, so the former military intelligence officer outlines the actions you must take to succeed and the mindset you need to adopt. Garcia's easily digested writing style, peppered with plenty of real-world examples from the military, politics and business, makes this motivational book a rewarding repast. We suggests Garcia's success manual to managers looking for a refresher course in staying focused, inspired and on task."
4,Juggling Work/Life/Success,"This book does a good job helping you prioritize your relationship between work, success, family and personal growth, with clear & concrete advice. Like most books of this type, it suffers from the vacuum effect--advice as textbook. But it is inspirational and helpful. Coming from a completely different angle, I love how author Bruce Stockler discusses the way he shifted his priorities--work, marriage, kids--in ""I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets."" Very inspirational, but a humorous memoir, not a self-help book."
4,I liked it,"I'm a pretty big fan of motivational books, because they seem to be exactly what I need at any particular moment. I actually found out about A Message From Garcia through an email spam. It was touted as ""different."" I'm not sure how different since many books of this genre are usually speaking the same message, just with different examples and perspectives. But, it was easy to read and kept me turning the page. I really liked the ""how to"" aspect of the book. After all, it isn't any good reading about other people's success if you don't know how to make your own.A big ""different"" -- The book was augmented with a website called Success Compass which helps you set goals and then e-mails you a reminder at whatever frequency you wish, even several times a day. I guess the key to success is not allowing yourself to forget what you want, and the Success Compass website doesn't let you forget. I liked it and I think you'll like it too."
1,NO titles???...NO Review!!,"How can one possible review an album that is without samples...or at the very least, titles!!"
5,Great organizer!,I recently ordered the Racor X-Rack Organizer and I love it!I assembled it myself without difficulty. It is well made and a good size to hold and organize most of our sports items. I would buy this again and highly recommend it to others.
1,Waste of time and money,We were not even able to assemble properly because the holes did not align for the screws. The box arrived poorly taped and every piece was dirty. Don't waste your time and money!
4,X-Rack Organizer,"I read the only other review on here and was hesitant to purchase this item. I ended up ordering two and I'm glad that I did.I have 5 children and live in the northeast and needed something to hang and store my children's winter clothes on and these are great!It sounds like the previous reviewer was putting the rack together upside down. You have to follow the directions and make sure that the holes for the metal basket are on the bottom. Not all holes are perfectly aligned, but if you screw them in part way and then tighten altogether it should workout fine.I now have two X-racks full of winter clothes that are able to hang dry in my playroom. I put two boot pans beneath the racks to keep our carpets dry. They work great!I almost can't wait for summer to come so we can store our bats, balls, gloves and nets on them."
4,Clutter capture!,"We used the storage rack to clean up the sports clutter in our garage and it passed the test marvelously. Our favorite thing about it is that it's so versatile and allows us to store so many different kinds of equipment - both the big boy and little boy stuff. I don't have another storage system to compare it to, but perhaps that is also testimony because it got the job done. A great buy from our perspective!"
2,Not what was expected,"I find this to be unlike other Racor products I own. It is not well designed, and pretty flimsy and does not hold as much as I would have thought."
2,Good idea. Bad execution.,Like some of the previous reviewers wrote. Half of the holes did not line up to bolt together. On top of that it was missing the second set of arms. I called and they sent it right out but just something else that didn't work right.
2,Needs an Alignment,"This product is a great idea with a bad final design. The holes are not aligned. Attaching the racks to the standing bars is impossible. I chose a few to align with the screws and used heavy duty zip ties for the misaligned holes. The zip tie bends to accommodate for the lack of alignment. I called Racor and they sent a new X-Rack free of charge. Unfortunately, the new one did not align, either. Do not purchase this unless you can drill holes through metal, have zip ties at home, or feel like having a product that does not assemble as it should."
1,Move On. Nothing to see here.,"What a disappointment. I have never had a problem putting things together, even if directions were lousy photo copies.None of the holes lined up properly, could have used some washers. When it was finally completed, was worried it was going to fall over as it was wiggling side to side. Do yourself a favor and move along. Dont say I didnt warn you. Can't believe I wasted so much time on this thing, then have to repackage it for a return. The picture may look great, but be warned.FLIMSY!!! Buyer beware. Arrrgghhh!!!"
4,Good product,This sports rack is made well with the exception of the netting. The only problem is the nets started to fall apart after two years. Not sure how I'm going to replace them. I looked all over to buy a sports rack in a b and m store but couldn't find one so of course I turned to my best friend Amazon.
2,"Nice design, poor workmanship.","Materials and finish are good quality. However, the experience was ruined by poor workmanship. The holes simply do not line up on the parts in order to assemble it properly. The holes are so far off that it is necessary to redrill some of them in order to actually put this together. Lot of work. Company offered to replace it, but it's too much work to disassemble it, repackage everything, and wait for a new one. And the next one may be the same, anyway. Since I imagine these are manufactured using a jig or fixture, it looks like there was a bad setup at the factory and would then result in many units manufactured this way."
2,"We like Almodovar films, but not this one.","I agree with those who give it 2 stars - even my wife, who loves Almodovar films, lostinterest. Read Roger Ebert's review of the film - he gives it only one and a half stars. Glad we rented itfrom the library."
2,Disappointing Almodovar,"Pedro Almodovar has been getting better and better with age. He's made remarkable and unforgettable films--All about my Mother, Talk to Her, Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!--and his latest movie, Volver, was a masterpiece.But even geniuses fail sometimes, and The Flower of my Secret is, in my opinion, a blemish on the outstanding career of the Spanish filmmaker. It's not so much a terrible film as a dull and mundane one--and coming from Almodovar, there might not be a greatest sin than that."
2,Fair,"The Flower of my Secret, directed by cult Spanish director Pedro Almodovar is a ""talky"" disappointment. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS."
4,good,"arrived on time have not used it yet so can't say more, shippment was fast looking foward to using it."
2,Not very helpful,"Unless you're already taking a French class, this product doesn't help at all. It has some things to read and listen to, but it doesn't teach you how to speak French, which was what I was looking for. Don't buy this product unless you already know French and want to practice."
2,"Just plain bad for beginners, bad format, and a bad buy!","The format was terrible! You couldn't find anything you were looking for. The games were very difficult, and it does an awful job of giving you vocab words. It would be much better for an advanced french student brushing up on the language, but I would not recommend it!"
4,Great tool to perfect pronunciation!,This product is great if you know the basics of French and want to perfect your pronunciation. It has been very helpful for me in my studies of the French language.
2,User interface needs an update,"This program has some useful features (like the voice comparison) but getting around is a pain, and it is difficult or impossible to do some things. It's difficult to tell where to start, switching from word to sentence pronunciation is not possible, and it's impossible to go back to the ""previous step"" if you accidently click the ""next"" button twice. The male french speaker was talking at warp 9, and the ""slow down"" feature just put a lot of static into the voice."
1,Not helpful at all,"I returned this item. The voice was awful, and the structure was terrible. I was using XP, so this might be better with an Apple system."
5,Lightyears Ahead,"What can I say? I had the lp, way back when, so when I found a German import way back in 2000, I just had to have it.This album predates the digital age. Using analog synthesizers galore and a mix of real and unreal drums and many overdubs, both instrumentally and vocally, it was a very ambtious adventure. Add to that, the music themes are futuristic and spacey, and well what have you got? A real trip.Imagine Gary Wright's ""Dream Weaver"" on acid as a concept album. One of my all time favorites, as a keyboard player/composer."
3,Incomplete Vegetable Roster,"This is an okay book insofar as roasting methods, etc., for vegetables. However, why were there no recipes for the non-exotic vegetables, i.e., broccoli, cauliflower, brussels sprouts?"
5,Makes Your Veggies Taste Great!,"We all need to eat more vegetables and this book, The Roasted Vegetable, will make your vegetable dishes delicious! The recipes are easy to make too!"
4,Like a brighter Brick,"Very noirish and sultry. Stylishly shot, expertly performed. A tour de force High School gumshoe tale. It is quite unrealistic, but funny. Band of Horses play during a school dance. The dialogue is crisp and witty. The set design is inspired. A cool burn. Bruce Willis as a sociopathic principal is hilarious."
3,High School Slap stick Comedy detective movie,"I had to write something. Those that gave this ""undistributed"" video 5 stars must have owned stock in the movie. One short T&A and adult language will likely create a minor cult following buts that's it. It is said the movie had distribution problems, actually they had a script problem. It really hurt to see my favorite Bruce Willis playing the part of a stupid High School principle doing vaudeville ""stick"". Funny at times but watch it if you must, but rental is a better bet than purchasing the video. SORRY!"
3,More ambitious than great.,"Bruce Willis adds weight to this somewhat complex, if not beleivable, story of high school investigative journalism to the rescue. Willis doesn't take up much screen time but he does make a pretty good high school principal for the scenes he's in. I liked it better in the beginning than in the end. Finally, it's a high school movie, with new (and cliche) versions of ""high school cool"" and sophistication amidst a scandal in the student body - and corruption goes right up to the top (in this case the student body VP). Was hoping for something more in the black humor vein of say ""Heathers"" or ""Election"". Unfortunately it takes itself more seriously than either of those. I know, this is supposed to be some kind of high school ""noir"" - an idea that sounds more clever than the movie is. Beverly Hills 90210 meets All The Presidents Men is more like it. Rent if you must."
2,great movie if you are 15 years old. today.,"I mean if you really want to see high school done film noir than obviously go check out the far superior BRICK. This film also reminded me a little of one of my old faves, THE CHOCOLATE WAR, which is just waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay better. Even CHARLIE BARTLETT which was only kind of so so, beats this.""Assassination"" isn't the worst movie ever. Its just not especially good. And I really wanted to like it. I just didn't. I'm pretty sure the problem was the story itself which was kind of rambling and weird in a not especially good way.Watch the movie, just don't buy it."
4,Not Your Average Teen Movie,"The only similarity between this movie and other mindless fluff that passes for teen movies is that this is set in a high school; after that, all bets are off. This is actually teen noir, much likeBrick, but this movie takes its inspiration fromChinatown. I'm not going to give anything away, but I like the lead actor; he nails the part, and Bruce Willis steals every scene he's in with his quiet intensity. I'll admit I wasn't sure about this, so I rented it first, but now I'm going to buy it."
4,You are never too old to go back to High School,"Ola, mi amigos. I really liked this movie, and I'll tell you why. (duh) It runs a delicate blend of odd seriousness, and dry humor. The cast is excellent. It's always a plus to see someone like Bruce Willis show up in a lower budget film like this. The other thing I liked was the directing. Clever without being over the top camera artistry. Also I'm a sucker for a good detective story. There is a nice character arc for Bobby Funke, our main character. Going from wannabe writer to true detective, true writer. I'm not going to launch into the details of the plot, but I will launch into the buy this movie spiel. If you are looking for a well done, fairly fun film, then this is the one for you. There are actually vendors selling this movie for as low as 25 cents to 1 dollar used here at Amazon. Wow, now that's an entertainment bargain. So toss your money around. Come on help the economy out...lol""cliffscosmicmoviereviews"""
5,The Universal Found in the Verse of Particulars,"The Daily Mirror is David Lehman's writing at its finest. So many of the poems move as water falling and turning, fluid and full of surprise. His sense of the poetic line and his innovative use punctuation (almost none) blossom into moments that hold and propel the reader. He uses the timing of poetry in concord with the pace of a life moving and moved by people, images, and ideas. The world of particulars in his verse captures a time (our time) that the reader will want to return to again and again. These poems read like a treasure hunt that never ends. Everyone will have their favorite day in this book of daily poems."
4,"Multiple universes, multiple choices.","This is one of the few Star Trek novels that I could not find much fault with or errors in the plotline or Star Trek lore.This not a ""happy"" novel. Like many tragedies, Echoes focuses on the overwhelming tragic situation of billions of people dying every hour. This book is not for the squimish Star Trek fan.Solid plotline, storyline, and almost believable final resolution."
3,Good effort.,"I always like the stories about paralel universes in Star Trek such as 'Q' Squared and 'Dark Mirror'. However, 'Echoes' gave me confusion about the universes. The best example to use is 'Q Squared' where Peter David used Track 1, Track 2, and so on. This eliminates the confusion of the multiple universes, especially when there are only slight differences between the universes in 'Echoes'. Furthermore, the ending in 'Echoes' is somewhat puzzling. If the Voyager ended the timeline, then what is the purpose of the story in the first place. Other stories about paralel universes show endings in the timeline, continuing the timeline itself, not ending it. Well, this novel is a good effort, but it should have become better."
4,"Fast-paced, well-constructed multiple reality story","First of all, if you're the kind of person that gets headaches thinking about temporal loops and alternate realities, then this isn't for you.It's a bumpy road until you understand the multiple universe construction of this story. But once you get a handle on it, within 4 or 5 chapters, it's a smooth action filled ride. The confusion you are feeling actual enhances the story adding to the complexity of the mystery the crew faces.The story also provides vivid imagery and well placed emotional introspection by many of the crew giving the reader a up-close-and-personal view of the crisis.The multiple universes lend nicely to the short chapters and making it a fast read."
3,"A good book, but it could have been better.","Echoes is one of those books that I could see as a pretty good Voyager episode, that is if it was done right. Echoes has a very intrigueing plot, but the problem is that the plot doesn't really go anywhere (with the notable exception of universe 2410) until nearly the end of the book. The ending is surprisingly cliche, but I suppose I shouldn't have really expected much more. The different universes could have been explored much more in my opinion than they were, and unlike some of the other people who reviewed this book, I would have liked to see more universes included, with bigger differences in each one. Overall, this is a good book, and it is worth reading just to read a take on an interesting idea, but don't expect too much out of it."
5,Star Trek RulZ! EcHoEs? eChOeS!,"This was a A Great Book! I have Been Reading Trek NoVeLS for 5 years, and watching it for 10. You say that's Not a long time? Well YOU probably are not 14. I am really into Trek, Star Wars too, and I agree that Q-squared and Dark Mirror WERE great, but so is this book. Read ""Doctor's Orders"" it is great, so is the ""the wounded sky"" and the BEST OF ALL ""BEST DESTINY!"""
