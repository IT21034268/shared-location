1,Songs From An American Failure: Learning How To Sell Out,"God this album is terrible. I have an hour long commute to work and was hoping it would be a great album. I used to love Everclear (especially So Much For the Afterglow). But when Art starts talking in the third person about how he looks like a sensitive, cute Perry Ferrell (on Unemployed Boyfriend) it is embarassing and I am tuning out. Also, they really have to get rid of the strings, banjo, synthesizers, and overproduction. Don't buy this album. Unless you really really love, power ballads with a pop flavor, you will be disappointed. If you haven't listened to So Much For the Afterglow, go get it instead."
1,stupidest song on earth,never hear wonderful. why? because at the begenning it only says wonderful. i think its retarted to have that song on now 5. i hate it and its retarted
5,Great songs from a great group,Great CD Love the bass work on it. It is hard to top beach music tunes or groups. It is a genre of music all it own. Love it!!
2,*yawn* Recycled and rehashed....,"DMK's attempt at a magical training manual is really just more of the same-old-same-old. It takes the standard western hermetic tradition and dumbs it down (rather than simplifing), without adding any significant insights. There are much better sources for this information, such as Regardie's Golden Dawn books, and Crowley's Liber ABA (Book 4), both of which give wonderful insights of true masters of the magical arts. DMK's well-intended book fails miserably on this front. What little original content there is in it is thoroughly unimpressive.The final straw for me was his repeated harping against ""black magic"" without ever really defining what it is, leaving the student with a vague sense of fear and paranoia that he is somehow in danger of getting into some sort of mysterious, secret, nebulous trouble.All in all, it is an extremely non-scientific approach the hermetic sciences. Save your money."
4,Great for beginners...but often oversimplified.,"Kraig cuts right to the chase with this practical manual of ritualistic magic. This works and it doesn't. On one hand it gives the beginner to the Great Work a chance to jump right in without having to wade through countless works of incoherent (stuff) concerning the philosophies of magic. On the other hand, it has the tendency to make the reader beleive that they do not have to understand any of the philosophies of magic, this in my opinion is dangerous. But otherwise a great read."
4,"A good book, but caution is required","I purchased this book a few years ago and it was the primary source of occult information that i utilized for several months with positive results. Overall it is a very good book for the beginning ceremonial magician. However, there are a few errors in the book, some of which the author intended, some of which he did not. For example, after cross checking one of the sigils for the olympic spirits, i found it to be in error. I imagine that there are other minor errors as well, so i would recommend close scrutiny before the use of some of the more advanced ceremonies. This aside, i would recommend it to any beginner."
4,A great starter book!,"Modern Magick is one of the easiest to understand magick books that I have found. I am constantly impressed by the foundation it gave me in magick. This book is really easy to use, as it walks one through the rituals (unlike other books that just tell you to ""go do a protection ritual"") and makes you understand what you are working with. This book is not a book for children though, its content can be confusing and weird at times. I do recommend it as a starter and great reference on the cabalistic traditions"
2,It could be worse,"Unfortunately, Kraig's book is incomplete and inconcise. It's fine if you want to practice Ceremonial Magick, but first you should learn the basics of plain old Magick. Read ""Liber Null & Psychonaut"" by Peter J. Carroll, ""Basic Magick"" by Phillip Cooper and ""Real Magic"" by Isaac Bonewits. No amount of Qabalah or Alchemy can give you all the practical information in these three books alone.And one other thing: the information on using the Keys of Solomon is hardly original, and worse yet, dangerously incomplete. Go to the original source: ""The Book of Solomon's Magick"" by Carrol 'Poke' Runyon, and the accompanying video, ""The Magick of Solomon""."
5,Truly a required book for anyone new or experianced,"This is truly the greatest book I have ever read on Kabalistic magick. Kraig puts all the information needed to begin or advance study of the ways of magick in a way that anyone could understand. This book explains everything from amulet construction, to spirit evocation. I am a 16 yr. old Adeptus Minor and I found this book to be the easiest to follow book on magick I have read. (Great price too!)"
5,A good start,"Yes, this book may oversimplify a bit, but Crowley and Regardie are hard reads to someone with no Magickal background. This book will get you started with good basic simple info on the main subjects you need to know, and has an excellent bibliography to keep you going. This is the ""1st grade primer"" for aspiring magicians- if you have any prior knowledge, an unnecessary book, but if looking for a 1st book for your occult library, buy and read before spending money on the ""classics"" because you probably wont understand them yet anyway. Also, for Pagans and Wiccans, a good view of a slightly different path. In other words, buy this FIRST, then dive into ""Magick in Theory and Practice"" or ""The Golden Dawn"", it will make them much easier to grasp. Will also make those cool Grimoires you bought like the Keys of Solomon usable."
2,very dirty book,the book came very dirty on the out side .the covers are peling.the page hase a tear. however the pages on the inside are clean.it will do for now untail i can get a new copy.
4,Great for beginners but limited for experienced folks,"The author is great at plain english translations of relatively complex concepts in ritual magic, but after 20+ years of on and off casual study I consider most of the concepts in the book very elementary and I honestly don't consider myself all that advanced in formal ritual magic. My primary focus is on the mechanics of spirit and how/why something works. I'm not sure how relevant that is to the review here though, other than to say I don't consider myself an ""expert"" in high magic and I still found this book very basic.I'll keep it for my kids though when/if they start studying. It'll be a great primer for them."
4,This book was laid out very well for the beginner.,If this is by far one of the better books. The way it was laid out in lesson chapter was great. Rituals laid out in the book are quite accurate and explained well. One thing i would like to say is that Mr. Kraig may have done well to leave some of his opinions out of the text though. That does make the book more personal as opposed to cold but for a rookie that may not be the best way to go. The rookie needs to be free from opinions and assertions from authors. Not in terms of knowledge just opinion. However im confident that any reader will make his or her own opinions and use this excellent manual as a great source of information. All in all this is a great book.
4,HELIONS Recommendation,HELIONS - this is one of our standard texts and we would recommend this book to any beginner in High Magic. It is well written and easy to follow.
2,Lovely Ballad Ya Know,"I bought this about a month before Christina's Spanish language debut was released, which means right around the time this was receiving a massive dosage of overplay. Radio really can make me sick of a song, and this is a song that radio ruined for me. I find it pretty boring, will the Spanish version seems even slower, and makes me tired. Christina looks lovely on the cover, and the song is LOVELY, but it is far to boring. It also has a sticker, and the enhanced video for your computer. While it is great video, she looks a bit too layered with make-up, providing a clown-like view of her. If you can listen to a song even after the 5,000 + radio overplays, your a stronger person than I, and you should buy this lovely Diane Warren tune, but if you are one who tires of the same old song, seek music some were else."
5,CHRISTINA: TEEN POP DIVA!!!,"This CD is great. Christina Aguilera has a beautiful voice. Christina is the Teen Pop Diva. The spanish version ""Por Siempre Tu"" is the best of this CD [Single]. On this Cd you can also see Christina's ""I Turn To You"" video. I also recomend ""Pasional"" by Jessica Cristina and ""Eterno"" by Luis Fonsi."
5,ANOTHER SMASH FOR CHRISTINA.,"THIS IS CHRISTINA AGUILERA'S 3RD SINGLE OFF ""CHRISTINA AGUILERA"". THIS IS THE RADIO EDIT, DIFFENT FROM WHAT'S ON THE ALBUM. IT ALSO HAS A STICKER OF CHRISTINA AND THE SPANISH VERISON OF ""I TURN TO YOU"". ANOTHER TOP 5 HIT FOR HER!"
5,Christina Aguilera demonstrates to continue being the best,"Song of excellent content in their letter that enriches those in love people that it shows the excellent quality of the artist's voice, their quality and charisma once again, when you listen and see this CD you will never be able to forget to Christina Aguilera."

5,Love Louis!!,"I haven't actually read this book yet, but I sure do love all of Mr. L'Amour's cowboy books!! And now I can read a bit about the man behind those great novels!"
2,A ok book,"This book at some parts has very interesting stories. Louis L'amour has been through many interesting situations before which he describes in this book very well. At some times he can be very preachy so you just are goin to have to get through though parts fast to find the tiny nugget of information he leaves. He has good points that are sometimes hard to discover under his words. There are interesting facts of history also in this book.signed the g who read this book himself,R G C"
2,Maria's Book Reveiw,I read this book for my reading class. I like horror and mysteries so it wasn't appealing to me but i gave it a try. The first few chapters were interseting but as I got past like chapter 12 it got a bit boring. It had good information and good concepts but it didn't grab my attention like horror or mysteries do. It was interesting to read about Louie Lamour because I have never read any of his books before this one but I saw some of his movies on T.V. I did like this book but I would only recomend it for people who like biography's or whatever genera this book would fall under. I would give this book 1 thumb up out of 2. Anyway I hope who ever else reads this book enjoys it. Have fun reading...
2,Education of Wandering Man review,"The book ""Education of a Wandering Man"" was an alright book with some things I liked and some things I didn't. The things I liked was Loius L'Amour telling about his adeventures around the world like boxing,mines and Shanghia.Also, how he told about the people he meet on his travels and what they did. The things that I didnt like were his preaching on readind, writing, and traveling. Also, He just goes on with the books he reads which gets very boring and last for the entire book."
2,Maria Rouse's Review,I read this book for Reading class. The first time I heard the title of this book right away it did not sound interesting to me. I'am in to horror and mystery books and this disn't sound like either but I read it any way. I thought this book had good lessons and good information it just didn't catch my attention as much as horror and mystery books. After the first 7-8 chapters I thought it got a bit boring. And I didn't quite get it either but I guess that's just me. If I could change it a bit I would add more suspense or mystery to it. I read this book because I have seen his movies and they looked interesting. But the movies kept me interested more than the book did. But I would reccomend the book to anyone who likes biography's or what ever genre' this book falls under. But who ever reads this..I hope you enjoy the book more than I did. And you can email me and let me know how you liked the book. Have fun!
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring","I am a huge Louis L'Amour fan, so I thought I would love this book. Wrong! It's incredibly boring and self indulgent. I think I understand why he wrote it, but he really should just stick to novels of the west.It seemed to me the things he could have written in a paragraph took up a whole chapter.He also listed all, and I mean all the books he's ever read, which didn't really matter to me. He could of just given a short list of the interesting books he's read throughout his life, not every single book every read by him.All to say, if you are looking for Louis's normal western adventure, you might want to skip this one."
3,l.l. book review,"This book was a very well written book, but got boring many times throughout the book. In terms of likeing the book, it was average. Even though I dont really care about L.L. or what he wrote, at most times, I enjoyed the book very much. Compared to all the books that Ive read, it would be more like a 1, but this was a biography, and it was on something that I didnt really care about, I was excited at times. Overall the book was very well written and made alot of sense. I liked the book at some points, then disliked it at others."
3,Eduction of a Wandering Man,"Education of a wandering man,This book had its goods and bads. Louis LaMour had many adventures in his day. he travled all over the world, he was a boxer (and had good boxing contacts and friends). On his adventures he met many exotic and famous people. He was hobo train hopper who met old wise with great stories and tells them to you in his book. he was also a very big reader, and tells you about odd and interesting books that you probably would never have heard of otherwise, and if you like this book you could be inspired to read some of them."
1,What a disappointment!,"First, this ball is a kind of gross marbled yellow. Second, it's not the kind of tough plastic that is normally used for these balls, it a weird, softer plastic that means every little thing it comes into contact with (fuzz, dirt, crumbs) sticks right to it (and I'm an avid vacuumer!!!). Third, the pump is also strange - it came new out of the box kind of greasy??? Fourth, I would have just returned the stupid thing if the company didn't make it seem like it would be more money and effort than it was worth."
3,Misleading - not chrome,"This item is not chrome; it's plastic painted a chrome color. For the price, however, it's not bad."
3,Little disappointed,"I thought this was going to be chrome. It is just chrome looking, completely plastic. It looks the part but I wanted a heavier holder"
2,Still plastic,"At 4 times the price of the other plastic one, I believed this was real metal. Not only is it plastic, but the silver coating hangs over at the edges (not trimmed well) and looks awful. Not worth the price."
2,Johnny Cash 'Man in Black',Condition of the book was not as good as I would have liked.Man in Black : His Own Story in his Own Words
3,Man in Black review,I thought by the description that the book would be in better condition than it was. It also smelled like it had come from the library or store of a cigarette smoker. My daughter still loved it so I'm glad I got it.
3,"Like ""Chicken Soup""","This reads like a Pre-""Chicken soup for the Christian soul"".A valuable read if you're a Cash-curious."
2,Discovery Channel dissapoints again.,"The content was severely lacking. I learned nothing by watching this video. No talk about design decisions, spacecraft features, technical challenges. It is the result of Discovery dumbing down their content. This DVD is very short, only 43 minutes. Look for the 150 minute version called ""Black Sky: The Race For Space."" I bought this short version by mistake."
2,"Just padding, save your money and visit a model show","The book has no evaluation of the plane,no pilot or crew experiences. There is hardly any specifications and those that there are, are filled with ""no data available"", the line drawings on the whole are poor, and there is no scale for the few scale drawings.So what is in the book? Mainly photos of a model, but it seems that that was not enough to fill this book out, so they decided to give you the same photos, once in black and white and once in colour.There is a good story to be told about this aircraft, but this is just a story of how not to produce a book"
5,Great Purchase,I bought 4 of these about a year ago and love them. My daughter has a food allergy and I have to send a single cupcake to school or birthday parties. The cupcake stays in place with the plastic prongs and holds a standard cupcake. I would recommend this to others.
3,They're okay,"These cupcake holders are easy to get a cupcake in and out of, but they don't really protect the cupcake. It protects from crushing, but there is enough space for the cupcake to move around inside the holder and the cupcake gets a little beaten up during travel. Better than a naked cupcake in your lunch, though!"
4,Antiheroes of iron,"This book characterizes the Italian immigrant experience in coming to America as a loss of values in trade for a new life. It describes exactly how one loses the old culture, and the old ways, and thus is assimilated and often destroyed, but how endurance gives one the right to live this new life. I found it an exceptionally vivid description of two generations of life in the New York slums as an Italian immigrant family, and while it was heavy on the drama (deaths, violence, failure) its dominant trait is its complex view of the primary characters. They are both not heroic, and yet stalwarts, and impotent, and yet keeping what they can of a value system alive in a country that tears it apart at every turn with money. I like this book the best of all of Puzo's that I have read, and would recommend it to anyone as simultaneously more literary and more real than his celebrated offer-you-can't-refuse bestsellers."
3,The Fortunate Pilgrim,"Although this book started off somewhat slow, there was just something there that made me want to continue reading. The author, Mario Puzo used a style of writing that was difficult to understand at times, but for the most part, it gave me a better understanding of the Italian culture, like for example their different customs. It also showed the hard times the family faced, being a lower class in the slums of New York. The events were set up in such a way, which helped the book unfold. I thought the author also used great characterization. The reader was able to see how each character in the family led a different life. I recommend that people read this novel by such a well-known author."
3,"Eh, so/so","Not Puzo's best work. Kinda a bummer, but what do you expect? I think this is either a love it or hate it book. But I can't necessarily say I'd recommend it. Maybe if you have LOTS of time to fill or an exeptionally long flight..."
4,Puzo impresses again,"The Angeluzzi-Corba family with its central character Lucia Santa, battles against 'unfortunate' hardships to preserve her strong Italian values. Lucia Santa believes the family is continually punished; yet it is the survival through these difficulties that is both 'fortunate' and touching.I enjoyed this story, both for its characters and subtle plot."
3,Print very small,"Ordered for a Christmas gift and received in time as guaranteed, however, print is extremely small. Possibly going to return."
3,True to life Italians,Puzo's depiction of what is his own family dressed in fiction is nothing short of real truism. In many Italian families it was indeed the mother who was the true and sometimes only leader of the house. No doubt and in this book the mother figure can be intensly stern. But like a lion she is fiercly protective and loyal to her cubs. Many Italians immigrated to NY and the cities section of Hells Kitchen. I think what makes this book special is its non mafia direction. The mother enforces that to lead a beter life is to work for it! Very good Italian American book on the stuggles of family mapping out a life in a poor area of NY
3,Airbed fitted cover,"A well designed product that is an excellent, INEXPENSIVE solution to a raised airbed for sleeping guests from time to time. It fits the raised, queen-sized air bed perfectly and its' price makes it very attractive. It is also very easy to store (comes in its' own bag) and ship.The only drawback: it's not very warm. You'll definitely need an extra blanket or two with this.....unless it's hot outside.Overall....a good purchase."
3,quality seems fine but too much metal,"if this is marketed towards air beds, then why couldnt they find a way to not use any metal? theres several metal zippers on this things.its making me very nervous having it on top of my air bed. so far nothing has happened, but metal and airbeds really dont mix. it doesnt really coverthe sides of the bed im using very well, like i was hoping it would. it needs to be longer on all 4 sides to cover it better. maybe the bed in the picture is lower than it looks. oh well ill just hope the metalparts never get pushed into the vinyl airbed hard enough to puncture it........"
2,disappointing,I was so excited to see this product but was really let down. It is very thin and scratchy. It did not fit on my air mattress as it had fitted corners. Was a great idea but a dud for me. I would not suggest it to my friends.
3,OKAY,This thing is pretty cool but its a little too tight on my raised colman.I got it on but it was a struggle.next time I use it Im gonna try only filling the mattress enough to give it some form and put it on then.then fill it the rest of the way.
2,Slightly disappointed...,"Received and its a lot thinner than I thought. No bottom padding at all to keep the body warm.Also I am glad I unzipped it to look before I washed it, as it came with some kind of animal hair or strange fibers all on the inside (looked like black dog hair).It washed well though, but do to the thin-ness of the bottom sheet underneath the zipped top, my guest used the whole thing as a padding to sleep on top of instead of inside -- so that kind of defeated its ""sleeping bag"" purpose"
3,Poor quality,"This is not accually a sleeping BAG, the bottom part that you lay on is just a thin peice of linen fabric which is disapointing if you have ever slept on an air matress on a cold night you know a lot of heat is lost through the bottom. Its also sewn very poorly. A great idea but not made well"
3,Sleeping Bag Mattress Cover,Goes on easy but not very warm.Zipper comes unzipped while sleeping during the night.
4,Not for camping without electrical outlet.,"I originially bought this bed for camping purposes. Sometimes you just get tired of sleeping on the cold, hard ground. You cannot tell from the product description, but this airbed cannot be inflated without an electrical outlet to plug into. There is no way that you can use a portable air pump to inflate this bed.I have every intention of keeping the bed, however. I know that it will make a great guest bed. It is easy to inflate and deflate in your home and quite comfortable to sleep on. You can have it good and firm or nice and soft and it is pretty stable for rolling over in the middle of the night."
1,Junk dictionary,"The only redeeming feature of this book is the cheap pulp paper it is printed on, at least that would be useful in the outhouse. The information is shallow and limited but shored up with, for instance, the multiplication tables of 13 thru 19. Then, too, there are all the capitols of the world. Definitely not worth owning or even giving away."
5,A Great Dictionary!,"The Oxford American Desk Dictionary is the perfect dictionary for the home or office. With over 100,000 entries, this will give a good, compact definition to anybody in need of the meaning of a word. It also has very useful appendixes like the meausurement tables, multiplication tables, capitols, Presidents of the U.S. and science and mathematical facts. So, the Oxford American Desk Dictionary is perfect for your home or office. Buy this great reference. Enjoy!"
1,the time on instructional part is very short,Laura Stamm's DVD and Robby Glantz's DVDs are much better than this.it worth over $10 dollar only when combine the content with vol 1.
4,Not bad,"Ladytron has some odd lyrics, but catchy.They would be under fav band for this type of music. ""Playgirl"" was the 1st one I heard and I thought what kind of song is this?..Then I liked it. Its not a bad band if you like Techoish/Industrial. I think thats right..."
1,"Look's good,Works bad!","I have done finish carpentry for thirty five years,and for twenty five of those I have used a Schlage lock gig.Thought it was time to update, you know round corner faceplates and all.Well,don't waste your time or money.This tool is the worst I have tried in some time!It will not hold to the door unless you tighten so tight it will crush the door.The 2 1/8 bit I don't think would cut through butter.I did not try the faceplate cutters,but they look good!"
4,Good deal!,"I have used it to bore about 50 wood doors already, and it works good. Also I have used it on commercial hollow metal doors 18 and 16ga. and works good too, but you have to change the hole saw guide to do metal doors and you have to be careful not to loose the small set screws and alen wrenches that come in the case. The only thing I would buy once I order one set, is a new extra carbide 2-1/8 bit, because at about your 10th door the bit that comes included starts getting dull, and you really have to push much harder., hopefully a carbide bit would make a difference, I haven't tried it, but will order one shortly. Thanks"
3,Almost good,"As another reviewer noted, it isn't the old Schlage set, but it appears to be the only show in town. Because it is it appears that it doesn't try too hard at being good. It looks like it has all the bases covered, but the quick release chuck fell apart on the first use, The forstener had trouble with a solid masonite/composite door. The works got stuck pretty quickly, needing lubing by the third door I worked on.Is it better than marking out with a tri-square and knife? Sure.Did it save time? Yeah.But I surely do not feel that I got a quality piece of equipment and will have to settle for babying it to work with it until something better comes along."
5,in my car 24/7,"this is my favorite CD right now. kmk delivers again w/ their follow-up to ""royal highness"" and doesnt disappoint. even though saint was my fav member of the kings, and i was sad to see him go, i believe that johnny richter does an incredible job replacing him. this CD is packed w/ speaker bustin beats and phat lyrics. all the songs are great, and a bunch of influences and styles are put into each one, making them sound all different so that you never get bored of the CD. if 'high society' is just the 2nd album and its THIS good, i cant wait to see what the kings think of next. Y2KMK."
5,Good Points on a good band,"This cd is smokin'! I ain't kiddin either, cuz, 1) this cd has been in my player for almost 8 months now and still going,& 2)They like to rap about marijauna, which is cool. There beats are awsome, as is their rapping. Who else has 3 mc's (D-Loc, Johnny Richter, Daddy X), a DJ (DJ Bobby B), a drummer (Lou Dogg), and a psycho break dancer? I don't think any other group out there has this kind of a great cast. All the songs on this cd are cool, though my favorites are numbers 2, 6, 10, 16 (with ICP) and 19. Also, this cd is over 75 minutes long and never gets boring! If you like the songs on this cd, or for a little taste of the KMK music, check out take a bite outta rhyme, cuz they got a kick @$$ song on that disc too! Peace, and blaze on."
4,Buy this CD... NOW!,"This CD is awesome, defenitaly pick it up. Track 4 and 16 are some of the best songs I've heard in a long time. The Kottonmouth Kings' (aka KMK) unique sound is very appealing, especially if your into the Insane Clown Posse, Cypress Hill, or Twiztid."
2,i wish i had bought a diffrent one,"i wanted a real hip hop cd for my collection and hoping this would be my answer i was really put down when i heard it. i'm a big fan of kmk but this cd is lacking or a better word. alot of the songs sound the same with the rhymes and the beats. i suggest getting hidden stash vol.4 or cloud nine, those are there better albums in my opinion"
4,"Solid choice, but not my favorite","This album is a solid choice, but I prefer:Hidden Stash IIJoint VentureCloud Nine"
1,Yeah...It's just bad,"What do you want me to say? There's a reason why, out of all the hundreds of CD's I own, this one sits in the back. I seriously can't tolerate this CD. It's existence annoys me to no end. This CD is, overall, a waste of time. 20+ tracks of these guys whining about how it's illegal to smoke marijuana. Time for some new subject matter, guys. Do they actually believe in the causes they rap about? Could have fooled me, it doesn't seem they are taking any real action. The beats are horrible, the rapping is amateurish and atrocious. I'd rather listen to Crazy Town and the last Limp Bizkit record before I pop this in again, and that's just sad."
4,Strong effort from the Kings,"High Society showcases the Kottonmouth Kings during what i call their psychdelic period(this album and Rollin` Stone). It`s a very good album with plenty of bumping tracks like Day Dreamin` Fazes, Joint, Lottery, and King`s Blend(my favorite song on the album) that shows the Kings` great mix of hip hop, reggae and punk. The only negative about High Society is that the last 5 songs are no where as good as the other tracks."
4,This CD is worth buying....,"I know you probably want to download this on Napster, but buy it at Amazon.com because this CD is worth it, and AMAZON is awesome."
5,You Will Learn MS Project 98,"I think this book is excellent. I found the material accurate and easy to follow. I brought this book for my whole project team, I thought so highly of it meeting it's title claim. I was able to take a topic and actually learn it in the alloted time. The beginning chapters provide a good overview of the topics and using MS Project, setting up the project, and good structured project design. When I have a team I need to get up to speed quickly on MS Project, I will again use this book as the tool."
5,Fabulous pipe organ!!,"If you like theatre organ, this disc is for you. It is an excellent organ first of all - a four manual Wurlitzer - part of the Netercutt Collection in Sylmar, CA. The CD captures all of the grand Wurlitzer's sound, and Tom Hazleton's performance is first rate. Highly recommended!!"
3,no title,"A very small slim volume of some text and 24 pictures of oils. Written about the middle of the 50s, I suspect the colors have faded. Most I had never heard of, but Pollack is included and so is de Kooning, when surely they were not famous yet."
4,Brother Sister - actually 4.5 stars,"Wow, only 11 reviews for one of the better releases of the early 90's? Well, I just had to add my 2 cents worth of love for this disc. I fell in love with the single, DREAM ON DREAMER, which got heavy play on both the radio & video channels I watched back in the day.The funny thing about a group like BNH which produces high quality music and is a somewhat self-contained band is that their music definitely stands the test of time. For those who get it in 2006 or after, they'll probably be very surprised to note that this disc was released in 1994! The group specializes in r&b; funk and features one of the unique voices in r&b;, N'Dea Davenport - while also producing terrific instrumental songs.To this day, my favorite tracks are: DREAM ON DREAMER, DAYBREAK, SPEND SOME TIME, BROTHER SISTER, TEN TON TAKE, FOREVER & SNAKE HIPS.If you don't have this disc in your collection and you like funkdified neo-soul, then you will love this disc!"
2,So disappointing.,"I liked ""Dream On Dreamer"" when it was getting radio airplay...so I bought this CD. I'm disappointed. I was expecting more energy, catchier hooks, more interesting songs. Yawn."
5,Words from an expert!,"Book arrived promptly in described condition. I was surprised to see this still available, to add to my professional collection. Would buy from this seller again."
3,Simple and Effective,"Making through dovetails is easy with this jig. The only note of caution is to align the board with pins and the board with tail. Once the jig is setup up per instructions, you don't have to worry about it anymore. So far, the only stock thickness i've worked with is 3/4"", which is the maximum thickness. In theory stock as thin as 1/2"" should work as well."
4,love the pink color,The folders are thinner that what I've expected compare to the ones that I had previously purchased from staples but they didn't carry them in pink.
1,Crazy Indeed,"Crazy, irresponsible and just plain implausible.She apparently has so little respect for the American public that she thinks we would actually believe that a person can go from hearing/speaking the voice of god and waiting for the ""mother ship"" to beam her aboard, to total sanity in one encounter.I do believe she is ""crazy"" but I'd classify her as a sociopath. And, while many sociopaths do come from abusive backgrounds, they tend to spread the damage around ten-fold as adults. I can think of several people and a few groups who will be damaged by this book, looks to me like she is well on her way to her legacy."
4,Call Me Crazy: A Memoir [ ABRIDGED] By Anne Heche (Reader),"I like the honesty Ms.Heche put into this book. It illustrates the contacts of her troubled childhood and her troubled-disfunctional family. In the book Ms.Heche describes the altercations of her insanity and the mulistaion of her late dead father,Anne also tell us about her relationship and breakup with her ex-girlfriend Comedian Ellen DeGeneres. Ms.Heche tells the story in such detail and such HONESTY, you just can't beileve how much she tells. And that is why I like this book."
5,Wonderful,"I'm a forty-something ex-romantic who has pretty much sworn off fiction. I picked this up on a whim at the library and read it in a day and a half. I was a little worried when it started out a bit copy cat of Sex and the City but it quickly evolved into its own. It is artfully organized and written, intelligent, insightful and..... romantic!"
2,Inaccurate title,"The book and title don't match except for the recipes that are used as a framing device to represent principles of a perfect marriage and tie the two women together. Neither had anything remotely like a perfect marriage and only had a tolerable marriage because their poor husbands didn't bolt. Both women were whiny and emotionally unfaithful - looking for love outside of their own marriages. The story had potential, and the importance of fidelity and commitment came through in the end, but I couldn't relate to either woman. Also, too many f-bombs. I know people use them but I don't want to read them."
5,What you really need to know about real love in the real world,"I'm going to skip a comprehensive review and just say this: Anyone wondering about the non-Hollywood version of what love actually is, how it actually works, and whether they're actually in it will almost certainly enjoy this book.Alternating between two people, times, and places, the book weaves into one the story of two relationships. What the two relationships reveal about love is both wrenching and invaluable."
4,recipe for a perfect marriage- recipe has the right amount of sugar,Sweet little book. I think the message is something every young married couple should be aware of. It was a fun clean read that was enjoyable and super quick
2,Recipes for disaster,"This book was selected for our monthly bookclub--all have varying tastes and I make it an effort to put time into selections I may not have selected on my own. Well, this book is sooooo sloooooow! I have been trying to read it for close to a month and am maybe 100 pages in. I would suggest this book to noone! I really thought it was going to be good--especially with the title. No way! Don't waste your time."
4,One of the better early Knott recordings,"Michael Knott, Lifesavers, LSU - all the work of Michael Knott and friends. This is one of the better ones he did in my estimation, but fans would differ. I didn't get much from shaded pain or dogfish jones, but like this one, grace shaker, screaming brittle siren and rocket and a bomb.There you have it - a quick and brief review where none existed before."
2,A very wierd book,"Inside the Playboy Mansion starts out really great. Shows the lifestyle most young bachelors want for themselves by showing how Hef entertained at his Chicago mansion in the 60s. Lots of socializing with very important figures of the day plus all the beautiful women these young men would want. As the book progresses throughout the decades(that's how ""Inside"" is divided), it's starts looking like a very uninspiringly put together society page from a newspaper. Ho-hum pictures with Hefner and celebrities. Don't get me wrong, the book also has some great shots of the most important playmates ever, especially Barbi Benton which was possibly the cutest playmate ever.However, the thing that bothered me the most about ""Inside"" was the last part, were Hefner marries Kimberly Conrad and they have two boys. Totally wierd. All the baby & family pictures just didn't fit. I mean, its starts out as this great sexy book and then it turns into a freaking family album, COME ON!"
3,Good late night fun,"This film whilst obviously not a classic is still worth a watch if you like bad horror films. Owing a lot to Evil Dead II in terms of atmosphere and plot it still has its own unique feel. At times it can actually be scary. Some parts are gory as well. For some reason though the best word to describe it is ""blue"". Not because of porn, but lighting. Nearly every shot within the cabin that the heroes are holed up in are completely blue tinted. The only gripes with this film are the backing soundtrack (which is very funny at times itself) is too loud and the evil monster - when you finally see it, it is clay-mation and just doesn't fit with the rest of the film. Aside from that though this is the perfect film to stay up to watch late at night with friends. It is very enjoyable and a great film, although for no reason you can really comprehend."
1,The kind of stuff that creates killers and child molesters.,"When a couple of ignorant hunters ruin a ritual tribute that keeps an evil dinosaur spawning moose creature at bey, a plethera of little hunting parties turn into hell on ice and only a land dwelling female can save them from the terror. Completely disgusting and wretched excuse for a horror movie makes us afraid to even imagine eating chili or skiing again but it's TROMA, what more could you expect? The effects and a nice poster of ""The Evil Dead"" do this ""film"" some justice. Don't pick out a favorite character, if you get my drift. If you liked BLAIR WITCH PROJECT..."
5,Glowing Review from Its #1 FAN,"I first saw this movie when I was an impressionable 7-year-old in 1982. Needless to say, it left its mark and I searched for the video for the newxt 17 years. I can't rave enough about this movie..I have seen it literally 100's of times. I listen to my soundtrack every day. Who wouldn't want to be Lucy or Strawberrry? The costumes, hair and scenery are wonderfully garish, but what WASN'T in the late 70's? I feel like a member in the elitist and most private club of fans who love this movie as much as I do! In fact, I like anyone who has even HEARD of it because it seems to be such a (GASP) ""forgotten"" film. My favorite scenes are, ""Lucy In the Sky with Diamonds"", ""You Never Give Me Your Money"" and both the opening and finale of the title song..This is a must for Beatles/70's Fans who want to watch an enjoyable movie..no thinking required!"
5,Sgt Peppers DVD,The DVD was as awesome as I remember the movie being! Not for young children! There is alot of sexual inuendo.
3,Cute fantasy set to Beatles Music,"We thought the movie was cute. The music was superb. If you are a Beatle fan, you will like music. All the artist's try to maintain the Beatles version of all the tunes with their own voices. We felt this movie and the artists who performed were complementing the Beatles. If you are looking for an exact replica of the Beatles, go elsewhere! If you like the music of John, Paul, George (Harrison and Burns) and Ringo you will enjoy this movie. If you are looking for the Beatles --- Go elsewhare! I liked it! My wife liked it! I've been looking for this movie for a few years. I found it. I bought it! You should too!!"
1,The WORST movie EVER,"Only rent or buy this if you enjoy movies that are embarassingly bad (Grease 2, Two of a Kind, Rhinestone). Please do not listen to anyone who remembers this fondly from when they were 7 years old. It is exploitative trash and poorly made. The world did not need the Bee Gees performing Beatles songs. We were all ok with the Beatles version."
3,Am I the only one who noticed....?,"I loved this when it first came out. Watched every year for the next 2-3 years (hey, I was a tween, lol). Then, as an adult, I got nostalgic, and found it in Tower Records. I thought, hey, why not? Yeah, it'd probably be cheesy, but that's half the fun, right? Well, yeah, it was cheesy, but it was still fun, until my favorite Beatles song came on, ""When I'm 64"". Now, when I watched it originally, I was caught up in the plight of poor Strawberry, running from that silly pervert, Mr. Mustard. It came to that part, and it was just as funny as it was back then. But, then, wham!! Halfway thru the song, they cut it out and went right into the next scene!! I thought, hey, this is a commercial DVD, what the?? It was like, someone had actually video taped it, and stopped it for the commercial too soon!!Kinda ruined it for me."
5,Sgt. Pepper's,"I saw the movie in the theater the day it came out, and I watched it last week for the 1st time since, and I got to say, I still like it! It brought up great childhood memories! Great family movie."
1,Sacrilege!,"The Bee Gees terribly portray the Beatles second best album, and have no place as no-talent disco freaks to pretend to be the best. Imagine Jean Claude (Clod) Van Damme portraying Humphrey Bogart and you understand why this film is so loathsome. As good as ""Sgt. Pepper"" was, its songs were NOT the basis for a movie."
3,sgt pepper dvd,"I finally bought this DVD not because it's a classic (far-r-r-r-r from it) but because I was in it at as extra. Fast fwd to 6min 47secs and there I am going from the right side to the left, arm raised, holding money. Maybe that makes 5 seconds a classic!"
1,Sgt. Crapper and the lonely Farts Club Band,"This movie is a preposterous attempt to capitalize on the music of the Beatles for commercial profit. The acting is...nonexistent, the musical renditions take perfectly good music and turn it into 70's schlock. The plot makes NO sense (a weathervane comes to life in the end and makes everything right. That is how this movie is resolved.)This is a glaring example of 70's rock excess and commercialization undermining all that is good about rock in the first place. This movie is perhaps the greatest reason we should all be thankful for, if not be a big fan of, punk."
4,"Great family fun, over and over","I too saw this film in the theatre in '78. I loved it then and I love it now. My husband (former Air Force) was traveling alot then and never got a chance to see it. He and I have always enjoyed the BeeGees music. He will now be able to see the movie I raved about. And it is a movie that I will let my children (ages 10,6 & 4) watch without any worry. I don't think anyone ever said that the BeeGees and Frampton were trying to BE THE BEATLES. I think they were having fun. More power to them.!"
5,I love this movie!,I first saw this movie in the theater when I was 14 years old and have always loved and remembered it. I love the BEE GEE's and Peter Frampton. I looked in video stores and department stores for this movie and just finally found a plase where I could order it to buy. HBO or Tv should show this once in a while.So our kids can see how much fun music can be. Besides the BEE GEE'S can sing the music alot better.I never liked anyone but Paul McCartny and he sounds much better by himself than he did with all the beatles.
3,Fun and Diversionary,"Like many movie-musicals (Grease, Xanadu, etc.), this film is intended to focus on sounds--not plot or character development. Those looking for the latter should avoice all musicals. This is light-hearted, plotless but full of solid musical performances. Conoissures can go to Cannes."
2,What went wrong?,"First time ordering instant video - loved the fact that it was simple, immediate, and the price was right. But, even with a cast of a 1000 stars, it really is pretty bad overall. The ""story"" is such a simple one so I don't know why it had to turn out to be such a mess. Still, it was good for nostalgic purposes and to introduce most of the stars to my teenager."
1,Made a pain in me gulliver,"I had the album back in the day (1978) and never saw the movie until it came out on Netflix streaming (2012). The movie is horrifyingly bad. Yet as a time capsule it's rather fascinating. I grew up in the 70's, and yes millenials, this is just how bad your parents looked back then. And how bad style was. And, well, everything. Except maybe some of the music. If you're a Beatles purist, skip this movie or have nightmares. If you're a BG fan, you'll love it. Otherwise, it's semi-watchable as a non-ironic Clockwork Orange, if you have the remote at the ready."
3,"Hopelessly dated, but...","I saw this movie in the theatre when I was 6 years old, taken by the world's coolest dad who wanted to get his son into the music of the Beatles but realized that said son was NOT going to strap on headphones and listen to the collection of vinyl under the stereo. Well, it worked. But more than that, it was actually pretty entertaining--an incredibly colorful and fast-moving movie with (of course) some of the catchiest songs in the universe backing it up. Granted, purists have a right to cry sacrelige at the thought of some of the musical numbers, but purists also have a right to lighten up every now and then. For better or worse, this film, _Star Wars_ and _The Muppet Movie_ are probably the top three overwhelming sensory media experiences of my childhood (unless you count that time my babysitter took me to meet Lyle ""Wonder Woman"" Waggoner, but that's another story entirely). Relax a little and give it a shot."
5,geniousness to the max,"people hate on this movie because it's ""stupid""...to them, i say 'get a life and a sense of humor'. i love the beatles and was skeptical about this movie before watching it, because if you're going to cover the beatles songs you better have an interesting take it, or do something new. i think this movie's campy enough that no one can really take it seriously or consider it a true attempt to compete with the beatles genious versions of their songs. it's just fun to watch, which i do regularly. if you don't take things too seriously and just like to laugh at majestic hair, lip synching, and the 70's then this is the movie's for you!"
1,A Career-Killing Turkey,"In early 1978, the Bee Gees were riding the crest of their phenomenal ""Saturday Night Fever"" wave. Then came the late-summer thud of ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" What a difference a few months can make! Except for Aerosmith, Earth, Wind & Fire, Steve Martin and Billy Preston, no one looked good in this embarrassing rock musical. Beatles producer George Martin somehow got suckered into working on the equally disastrous soundtrack album. The careers of the Brothers Gibb and co-star Peter Frampton (not to mention Robert Stigwood's entertainment empire) never truly recovered from this wrongheaded decision to imitate the inimitable Fab Four. Who knows what happened to Paul Nicholas?"
2,"Nostolgic, but nothing more","I saw this movie in the theater when I was a teen. I had hoped for more then, and I hoped for more now. It was not bad, but it will not appeal to anyone who is not a Beatles fan. My kids got a kick out of it because of the shiney 70s look, and they knew a bunch of the music.This movie is a loosely strung together series of later Beatles music, and a few inside jokes for the fans, but other than a trip down memory lane, the movie is not worth watching. I can even remember being dispointed in Alice Cooper's rendiditon of ""Because"" as a teen even though I was a huge AC fan. Still, Aerosmith's ""Come Together"" is as good now as it was then. Billy Preston doing ""Get Back"" was the most appropriate selection for a performer (Beatles fans will understand why).Unfortunately the movie lacks any real substance. It may be worth a rent for a trip down memory lane, but not worth owning. The chances I will watch this again this decade are pretty small."
2,"The ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" of rock music","1970's megaproducer Robert Stigwood hit a bump in the road when he tried to create a storyline out of characters from various Beatle albums. This has to be seen to be believed - George Burns with an electric guitar singing ""Fixing a Hole""? Donald Pleasance singing ""I Want You She's So Heavy""? Steve Martin makes a hilarious screen debut playing ""Maxwell"" from the ""Abbey Road"" track ""Maxwell's Silver Hammer"". Earth, Wind and Fire, Aerosmith, The Bee Gees and Peter Frampton are watchable in this assault on the senses that is now a camp classic. Lots of laughs and entertainment for bad movie fans, and I wonder why ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000"" hasn't done this turkey proper justice."
1,The Bee Gees' Bowwow!!,"A host of cinematic stinkers came out of the 70s, but ""Sgt Pepper"" stands out as possibly the worst movie musicals of its era. Was Robert Stigwood trying to cash in on the success of the Bee Gees? Or was he trying to one-up The Who and ""Tommy""??Great music it has....great acting it most emphatically does not. In a word...""ARGH."" I wondered how Peter Frampton manages to read sheet music since he obviously can't read a movie script. Great hair and colorful costumes weren't enough of a distraction from the lousy story and through the whole flick the one big question running through my mind was: ""WHAT is George Burns doing in this awful movie???"" He can't have been THAT broke.Sergeant Pepper has one saving grace: It will NEVER be as bad as ""Can't Stop the Music."""
2,"Cheezy acting, but the music is good...","I watched this when if first came out when I was a kid. It seemed good at the time. I didn't realize how short it was, there's hardly any talking. The only thing I enjoy about this movie is the music."
1,I hope to buy a better DVD next time,I bought this DVD since I have never seen this movie before. I had some great expectations since the choice of artists was truly excellent. However I find this movie rather disappointing even for Bee Gees fans or Beatles fans. The story of the movie is quite confusing and even the segments of different bands are included in not very well chosen way. There is no explicit or persuasive read thread in the movie. There may be some similarities with Magical Mystery Tour movie. After all - I don't want to be to unjust - the interpretation of Beatles songs of the great majority of the artists is very good.
5,A musical blast from the past,"1978, Disco was ""IN"" ""SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER"" was hot, and in the middle of this came ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", did it save us from the maddness around us? no, BUT it was fun to watch. This was/is a fun movie, Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees, come on. There was no bad acting, there was no acting at all, a simple story with GREAT music. The co-stars Steve Martin, Alice Cooper, Billy Preston, Earth Wind & Fire, Aerosmith, and George Burns, made this an enjoyable 1hr. 52 min. I was testing my memory at the end seeing all the special guest stars that showed up to sing the end title song, it was a whos who of rock n roll (Wolfman Jack, Edger Winter, etc. Connie Stevens? oh well) This was fun, as the song says ""A pleasent time is guarenteed for all"""
4,Sgt. Peppers,"This is the greatest movie of my childhood! Even though it is a little melodramatic, I still love it. The music is GREAT!!!!"
5,Good old-fashioned melodrama made modern,"I love this movie. There's nothing I like better than an old-fashioned melodrama and this is a good one with good music, good people and good ideals. Frankly, I think the concept of a weathervane that always points the way to happiness is something that should be incorporated into everyday living. I've had this out of the library several times now and am now going to buy my own copy. Major boos and hisses to any critics!"
5,TOO CUTE,"I think that this movie is SO CUTE! I'm 14 & when I started to get into the Beatles (I'm a die hard Beatles fan) my mom said that there was a movie that her & her friends used to love & it was called ""Sgt Peppers..."" & so I watched it with a friend (also a Beatles fan) & we LOVE that movie. I didn't know who Peter Frampton or the Bee Gees were before this movie, & I also don't understand why so many people hate this movie, but I think it's great & fun."
4,Screw The Crititcs!,"This was my first encounter with Beatles music. It was because of this movie that I bought all of my Beatle's albums. It's a fun movie, if you take it too seriously you WILL hate it. But, for those who can lighten up and enjoy a weak plot with great music, this one's for you."
3,The Music Is The Only Redeeming Part,"This was said to be producer Robert Stigwood's home movie and it sure seems like it. It virtually ruined nearly every musicians career that was in it. It's wildly bright, boisterous, flashy and tacky all at once. Besides the music, (of which, most are pretty good Beatles covers), there is no dialogue, save for the narration by George Burns (who even sings a song - don't ask).The plot is simply a bunch of the Beatles sixties songs strung together for kind of a story - that's it. Simple and silly with a happy ending. Blah, blah, blah! The majority of the music is sung by the acts with great studio musicians. However, there are some real bad renditions which will either offend or cause one to roll their eyes.Let me put it this way. The day production began, the Bee Gees reportedly begged to be taken out of the film. Sorry guys. A contract is a contract. They were one of the few survivors."
2,"Weak story, but well-done renditions of great music catalogu","Although the film itself proved to be the swan song for the RSO empire, and a huge blow to the careers of Peter Frampton and the Bee Gees, SPLHCB does offer a really good soundtrack. In addition to the mega-hits ""Come Together"" by Aerosmith, and ""Got To Get You Into My Life"" by Earth Wind & Fire, remember that this soundtrack also features Billy Preston boogie through his own remake of ""Get Back"", Robin Gibb's radio hit of ""Oh Darlin'"", and Frampton's poignant ""GoldenSlumbers"". When it comes to assessing Beatles cover albums of the 70s, this film's soundtrack blows All This And World War Too completely off the map. As for the film's premise, acting, and direction, it's best viewed as a Lennon-McCartney revue, rather than a through-composed screenplay. Only then, in a camp atmosphere, can it be viewed ""seriously""."
1,This movie is a good PSA for saying no to drugs,"It has some ""it's so bad it's good"" appeal, if you go for that kind of thing. I do not."
3,Hard to watch till the end...,"is this film. It gets utterly bogged down with the scenes of the robot and all the computerized singing. I saw this film when it came out in '78 and to me it's hard to believe this movie ever existed. Everyone whose career survived it forgot (at least in public) all about their performance in it. But I like the way it has a complete fantasy feeling and is not realistic at all. We can't make movies like this anymore. Good music too (for Rock n'roll which almost always was loud and obnoxious though). I think the WW1 army band instrumental rendition of ""We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"", played at the beginning of the film, sounds too modern for the year 1918 but since this is a fantasy that isn't immensely important."
4,"Silly, Has Moments, Great Collectors Item for Bee Gees Fans","The Bee Gees are probably the most undeservedly bashed rock band of all time. This project ranks only after ""Stayin' Alive"" as a source of derision. Make no mistake. This movie is silly. But for Bee Gees fans and open minded pop music lovers, the music is a real treat. If you remember the Bee Gees rise to success in the late 1960's and their Beatle-like harmonies, this tape is a must. The CD is not available and the tape is worth fast forwarding through. Highlights include: Barry Gibb with a warm, sensitive ""A Day in the Life""; Robin sings a soulful ""Oh, Darling"" and all three sing wonderful harmony on the title track. Aerosmith darkly covers ""Come Together"". Earth,Wind & Fire sing ""Got To Get You into My Life"". Billy Preston is at his best with ""Get Back"". Life is pretty complicated for us ""baby boomers"" these days. Pump these songs through your best speakers. I guarantee you'll be smiling!"
1,Rating of zero is generous,"I'll challenge anyone who may think they are a bigger fan of the Beatles than myself, however, this is the absolute WORST movie I had ever had the displeasure of viewing in my life. I simply cannot understand how the Beatles could have given the rights to their music to an outfit who could make such a disaster. This is actually painful to watch; you'd get more enjoyment out of watching paint dry. Don't waste your money."
3,Bad and Good,"This is a bad movie but I still love it. I remember seeing this in the theatre when it first came out. Okay, it's cheesy and kind of stupid but sometimes you just gotta take what you like and forget about the rest. I love the Bee Gees and I love these songs. I especially love Robin singing ""Oh Darlin,"" and Aerosmith (as the FVB- Future Villian Band)singing a really cool version of ""Come Together."" Awesome."
4,Nostalgic!,It was fun watching the oldie but goodie - which could not be located in any video store locally! Thanks!
2,"Only one!, Not six!","The toy itself is cute, but the photos of 6 in a bag on the page were entirely misleading. Overpriced for one small toy - should be no more than 6.99."
1,Previous reviewers lied,"There was only one, not six in a package. Instead of having 24 snowmen for students, I'm stuck with 4."
3,"CUTE TOY - Too small, No beans","This is nothing like the larger version. Much better to purchase the big guy. This guy is tiny and has no beans inside, similar to a stuffed animal from the claw machine but made better. Not helpful for kids to pretend play with, but cute stocking stuffer if you like the movie. Too expensive for what is provided, would not purchase again."
3,Open a Snowman Stand,"The Snowmen are darling. Just like the book/movie. Please note that there are 6 snowmen included in this package. Not sure what we are going to do with them, but they are cute. perhaps we will open up a little snowman stand for Christmas."
1,One-sided and ill-informed,"In the ""war on drugs"" most people take one of two fairly radical positions: either drugs are evil and should be completely banned, or are wonderful and don't really do much harm. Both positions are usually very poorly informed. I bought this book hoping to find a well-informed, balanced look at drugs. Unfortunately, this is another poorly informed, biased take by someone who obviously knows little about drugs aside what one could learn from a decent encyclopedia. It is decidedly anti-drug, and completely fails to examine why people would choose to use drugs. Edwards provides plenty of anti-drug statistics, but, when lacking legitimate backing, also reverts to anecdotes and unfounded generalizations to reach his conclusions that governments should do everything in their power to outlaw and discourage use of all drugs excepting caffeine. If you want decent information and any semblance of balance, look elsewhere."
3,Includes Old School Party Smash,"Tone Loc was a toy rapper best known for the irresistible party anthem `Wild Thing' (the rap tune, not the Garage chesnut). This album includes that track as well as `Funky Cold Medina' another kitchy hip-hop classic in the wild party boy style that was popular with rappers before the gansta explosion. Nothing wrong with it, if that's what you into. Fine for you big dance parties but not the sort of music that stays in your disc player forever."
3,This is not the '80s,"This CD features Tone Loc's two smash hits from the late 80s, ""Wild Thing"" and ""Funky Cold Medina"". These songs are both undeniable rap classics. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is not as good as those two songs. Most of the other songs are pretty forgetable, although ""On Fire"" is pretty good. The album reaches a definite low point with the five minute long instrumental ""Loc'in on the Shaw"", which Loc doesn't even appear on. Fans of old school rap may want to get this CD, if only for the two hits."
3,Dig this one (out of your closet),"Ignore the two radio cuts, which were beefed up with hard rock guitar samples for crossover potential, and dance to the spare but utterly funky backing tracks on the rest of this album. I just found my old cassette copy and...this is way funkier than many of the hip-hop albums being released these days. Sometimes Tone is too much ""on the beat"" and throwing out what you'd expect; other times, like on ""Cutting Rhythms"", he leaves nice wide spaces between lines to let the words hit."
3,Tone Loc is a west coast pioneer for sure---,"Being from the Mid-West, I didn't catch on to Tone's early regional hits, but I do remember the summer of '89 when ""WILD THING"" hit the top 40 airwaves, and another hip-hop hero was discovered by me-- I didn't finally get around to picking up the album until recently-- but it's worth it-- The Dust Brothers were definitely on-point producers-- who'da figured that they were a couple of white college students?"
5,Tone Loc Comes With the Head noddin' Beats,"Tone-Loc. MC extroardinarie. With vocal presentation similar to EPMD's bradadocio rhyme styleTone Loc hits harder then Mac Guire. But the beats are what make this album the classic that it is. Personnally, i had to pick up the three 12"" singles from this album on vinyl cause the beats were so dope and I needed the INSTRUMENTALS. The singles really do stand out. First there was ""On Fire"" b/w ""Cheeba Cheeba"" (Delicious Vinyl's first ever record). Then came the classic track ""Funky Cold Medina"", which has the ILL guitar choords (D and E and C) and where Young MC first showcased his unique rhyme flow; later to give fan the classic ""bust a Move"". Then ""Wild Thing"" (which if you remember is the music playing as (actor) John Candy struts down the hall in Uncle Buck) came out. What more can I say. Loc-ed After Dark is dope. BUY THE CD."
2,This is a rap album that was actually funny!,"No deep review needed! Just listen to ""Wild Thing"" and ""FunnyCold"" and you will laugh your @ss off! The sad part is thatsome of that is because this is so cheesy!"
5,Da Best,"We've used this guide on two trips to Kauai and have found it to be right on. Great guides to activities, places to eat, and stay. Great locals only kind of knowledge that goes way beyond your usual guide."
5,Great guide- even greater island!,Highly recommended! Unlike any other guide book I've ever used. Very user friendly and the incredible photos alsmost do the place justice. A+
2,nothing new,We were disappointed to find so many people at places they claimed would be secret and out of the way. The authors need to refresh the text with new areas and better organize the information. We supplemented with two other books we had along.
4,Perhaps a bit biased,"While this Kaua'i guidebook approaches the sheer excellence of the others written by these authors, I think they understate the effect of winter on the enjoyment of this island. The north coast, while beautiful, is not particularly enjoyable during a downpour while sliding in the red mud ubiquitous on Kauai'i. Perhaps the authors are less objective on Kauai'i because they call it home (?). The book would be more helpful if it were more candid about the impact of rain and trade winds on Kauai'i. The comments are in there but too subtle as written. If this is your once-in-a-lifetime holiday, you're better off avoiding the north half of Kauai'i in winter (""off season')."
5,Personal Tour Guide!!,"On our trip to Kauai last year, I took two guide books, this one and the Underground Kauai guidebook, guess which one we ended up using the whole time?! This guidebook was like a personal tour guide taking us around the island. It was soooo accurate!! The maps are right on the dot, we even tried the restaurants that were suggested in the book, they were right about the service, the food and the prices! We never stopped to ask for directions on our trips to many parts of the island. This book was a total bible for us on our trip, we totally worshipped it! It isn't even boring to read. I read it from cover to cover and I feel like such an expert on the island that I can give anyone a tour! We also went to Maui and I got the Maui version of this book, it was INCREDIBLE! We stayed at the places that these books suggested were the best and they were right on the dot! I RECOMMEND this book on your trip to Kauai! I am telling you, it is UNBELIEVABLE! I can't wait to go again!"
3,"Good Details, but BAD restaurant reviews","The book provides great details. However, if you trust the ""ONO (delicious)"" restaurant recommendations as much as you trust their recommendations on hiking trails and everythign else, you will be disappointed.Taste is very subjective, however, taken into account that NOT everyone has similar tastes, I would still say that the authors are WAY off on their recommendations. We went to ""The King and I"" and had the WORST Thai food we ever had. We also went to another Japanese restaurant and found the food to be BAD and overpriced."
4,Excellent guide,"Trusty travel guide. We just returned from Kauai and always made sure to have this book with us. We felt the information was accurate and did not have a bad experience. We had an idea of places to eat and things to do, when we were in doubt we would look to the book for recommendations and found they were right on target."
5,Kauaia,"This is without a doubt the best guide book out there. In fact, when we were on vacation everyone who was traveling had one! You can't leave home without it. The book paid for itself with money saving ideas."
5,Right on target- an honest guide by locals,"After using this book as my guide for two one-week trips to the Garden Isle I have only one word to describe this book - indispensible! From the basics to the most detailed review, this book has everything you need to know to make sure you see the best things the island has to offer and to avoid the tourist traps. You will be armed with the knowledge the locals possess, which is why this book is GOLD. Whether you want to snorkel, hike, helo tour, eat, dive or just lounge on the beach, this book will tell you where to go depending on what your tastes are. The books is written by people who really know the island, and clue you in to things other mainstream tourist guides would otherwise miss. It is full of pictures, maps, charts, guides and is organized to make finding what you need easy. Before you hit Kauai, be sure to read this one! Your vacation in paradise will be the better for it!"
5,Highly detailed guidebook,"We used this guidebook throughout our weeklong visit to Kauai, and it was a great help. Unlike in most guidebooks, the authors express their personal opinions quite clearly. The authors moved to Kauai some years ago, having first arrived as tourists, so they offer a good perspective on the island.The book can be fun and informative, even if you don't always agree. For example, we knew when we went to their favorite shaved-ice place that the line would move very slowly, but the cones would be huge and tasty -- right on both counts. We learned where to get the best value on snorkel gear rentals, etc. And now I understand their suggestion to rent a 4WD vehicle.The sightseeing section follows the road around the island, referencing the mile markers, so it's perfect for crusing around. The investment in this book was well worth it."
5,"Excellent, well-written guide!","Insightful, accurate, and well written guide to beaches, attractions, activities, and lodging on Kauai. Leaves a little to be desired if one is a gourmand looking for a gourmand's take on the restaurants on-island. Better source for restaurant info for the well-heeled would be Fodor's or Froemmers....however, this book is far and away superior to all the rest as an overall guide...perfect maps, pictures, insider advice, etc. Written by residents, with their insight and lots of humor!"
4,Just buy it!,"If you are going to Kauai, just buy this book. We (my wife and I) just returned from Kauai over the weekend (10/01) and took this book with us EVERYWHERE. We used it faithfully and found it reliable. From where to eat, beach, snorkel, find sun on an East-side rainy day, hike and even buy lots (everything is realtive in HI) gas it has it! Read it BEFORE you go (unlike we did) so you can get a grasp on how it is laid out. Have a great trip!"
2,Not Useful,I was surprised by the inaccurate information within this book. More than once I followed the advice of the author which led to unsuccessful dining experiences. This book is in need of an overhaul.
5,Very Informative and Entertaining!,"This book was the absolute best guidebook I found out there about Kauai, and believe me, I have nearly all of them, if not all! It was as if a good friend was touring me around the island. This book will surely not put you to sleep, where other guidebooks are dull, boring, and just straight facts with no opinions. Very beautiful pictures and accurate maps! The best thing about this book are the aerial views of the resorts and hotels in Kauai with comments and inside information! It's a must-have on your trip to Kauai! I also have The Underground Kauai Guidebook and it totally does not compare to this one. Not many pictures of Kauai in that one, only pictures of flowers and other small things she could have taken from her backyard. The Ultimate Kauai Guidebook is the best!"
5,A Must Have,"This is possibly one of the best books for getting around Kauai. Get it a couple of weeks in advance and plan your route.Ultimate Series + Rental Car = Seeing Hawaii at it's bestPS: Having a ""navigator"" helps to spot some of those off the road places when driving around the island :)"
2,Greatly Dissappointed,"Though the maps were noteworthy I was shocked at the manner in which some of the business establishments were reviewed in the the book. Curious we decided to ask the ""experts"", (locals), on the island about some of the businesses in the book. We were glad we did because we would have missed out on one of the best adventures on the island - Kauai ATV.So reader beware. Do your homework and remember that these are the opinions of 2 people with questionable taste. We found some of the reviews to be inaccurate and unnecessarily slanderous. Remember that the best advice is from those on the island who have an intimate knowledge of what is great about Kauai...and as soon as a book is publised it is outdated...."
1,Beware - buy another,"Full of inaccuracies. Can't even waste my time, just buy another book, there are many available."
3,Okay...just okay.,"My daughter wanted this for Christmas. It was all she wanted. For the limited things this doll does, she lost interest quickly. Honestly, I'm not happy that I paid full price for this, but it got played with for a couple days. Now it's a nice fixture on the bottom of the toy box.While pricier, the Dora house gets a lot more use and is more fun for her."
1,awful toy,Please don't waste your money on this toy. It will break the minute your child pulls on the hair it has really cheap parts but a good motor(but what good is the motor when the springs and things break)
5,an amazing toy,This toy is really good. Dora sings and it is wonderful and fun to play with.I recomend this for any dora fan of any ages.from tt niens
1,Pulled by the manufacturer?,I bought this toy for my daughter for an early Christmas present and I was severly disappointed in the product. The hair would grow one out of every five times you touched the magic wand to the gem or the gem would light up until you physically turned the product off. We initally thought that the batteries were used up and tried new ones with no discernable change. We returned the product and was informed that some of the major retailers were no longer carrying this product due to it was being deleted out of their system and that we would not be able to get a replacement. My daughter was crushed. I am now trying to find a good replacement for this doll which was a disappointment.
5,Great Pick,This is a wonderful doll. It is a lot of fun to see my daughter have fun. Interactive great quality. Beautifully made. Beautiful dress. Great idea. Great Pick.
5,Dora Fairytale Princess,"This is all my daughter wanted for her birthday. She was extremly pleased when she got it. She carried Dora around with her everywhere for about 2 weeks. That was over a month ago, she seldom plays with her now..... the hair does get a little ratty from going in and out."
5,Very well made!,"This is an excellent doll!Not only is it really cool to watch her hair grow but she is very durable!When my daughter received this as a gift her and her cousin were playing w/it.They got a round brush all tangled up in her hair.I thought for sure that it was ruined,however I managed to untangle the brush and to my surprise as I was combing her hair not a single strand brushed out!How many dolls can you say that about?"
1,Review by Parent.,"My daughter who is 5, recieved this doll for her birthday. She loves to watch ""Dora The Explorer"" on TV but was so depressed on her birthday.Dora's hair wouldn't grow. Plus, when Dora spoke we couldn't hear what she said. I thought it was the batteries that caused the problem. I had my husband change the batteries three times and it still didn't work. I suggest to all parents that you buy a ""Dora The Explorer"" product that is not electronic. This product is a total waste of money."
4,Great! - Until the hair falls out!,"My daughter asked for this doll for Christmas. She also received the Dress Up Dora and NEVER plays with it. The FairyTale Dora doll is the one toy that she has consistently played with since Christmas (all others are shoved under the bed). Well, Dora bit the dust this weekend. Her ponytail came completely out. My husband had to completely dismantle her and work on her for about two hours. He got the hair reconnected, but it no longer ""grows"". This wouldn't bother me if my daughter had played overly rough with the doll, but I don't feel that she did. Yes, she played quite often with her, but isn't that the sign of a good toy. I hate that for $30 she only lasted a month, but my daughter loves her sooo much I guess we'll be replacing her."
2,never play with it,"This is another one of those toys that does 1 thing. My girls played with it when they first got it for about 2 days and have never touched it again. Pretty boring. It sings and its hair grows. It is really hard. At least with soft toys the kids can cuddle it as well. Skip this one unless your child is a die-hard Dora fan. For us, it is one of those toys that will end up being given away."
1,Broke Down,"I bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas. Her heart was broken when Santa delivered her a broken doll. It did not work even after replacing the battaries. And of course, there were no more in the stores or online. Needless to say, I had to explain to a 4 yr old, why Santa brought her a broken doll. I am sure if we could have gotten one the was working it would have been great!"
1,Hair no longer grows after only a month,"This was the only thing that my 4yr old wanted from Santa. Once she got it, she was so thrilled that she wouldn't even take the hair down because she wanted her to stay ""pretty"". This doll was hardly ever played with and certainly not rough but about one month after Christmas the hair stopped growing. You could hear the gears grinding when the hair tried to wind down or up. This toy was a big disappointment for $30."
2,"One trick pony, and the trick is out of order","Well, it lasted less than two weeks. It's a good heavy doll and looks like it is made well, but within two weeks the hair stopped moving. It just makes the sound like it is trying to, but no magical hair.Before that disaster, it was an ok toy. It pretty much sings one song and then a few phrases if you wave the magic wand over the crown. However, if you happen to have a child that tends to lose pieces - know that you only get one magic wand. Without it, you are doomed to listen to that same song again and again. Maybe that's why her hair stopped growing. Maybe she grew sick of her own voice and her magical hair refused to cooperate any longer."
1,Disappointed Dora Fan,"I read the reviews for the Magic Hair Fairytale Dora before purchasing for my 3 year old daugter. I saw that some dolls were defective, but I didn't think it would happen to us. The dora doll that I spent so much time tracking down does not work. She talks just fine but the hair doesn't grow. The motor churns, but the hair doesn't grow or shorten. My daughter really loves this doll, we just wish it worked. I had to order online because no one had the doll in stock anywhere in town. I plan to contact the manufacturer."
4,Fun For Make Believe,My daughter received this toy as a gift and it's now her favorite doll!!! She loves to make her hair grow and shorten. She also loves to style her hair and put in the barrettes that come with the doll. Wouldn't trade it for the world!
3,Dora Magic Hair Princess,"My daughter seems to really enjoy the doll. She has played with it alot. However, I read reviews saying this was the best Dora doll ever. I can't see where it is better than any other Dora doll she has ever had."
4,My Daughter Loves It,"My 2 year old received this for her birthday and she loves it. The hair does get messy, but that really shouldn't be a surprise, given that it is ""hair."" My daughter drags it around by its hair, she brushes with the delicacy you would expect from a two year old, she drops it and it still works perfectly. I still haven't changed out the batteries it came with 3 months ago. The song is really cute and the questions and phrases Dora says are as cute and engaging as they are in the program. In response to the reviews stating that the doll has never worked, I suggest that you take it back to the store or call the manufacturer for a replacement. Sometimes things don't work, and while I understand your frustration, simply because you got a bad doll does not mean all the dolls are garbage."
5,Minnie and Moo Go to Paris,All of the Minnie & Moo books are sooo silly and funny! My 8 yr old and I love them.
5,Small project clipper,This is a great clipper for small jobs. We have a dog that has really heavy and thick hair. The clipper had to work fairly hard to cut the hair. Wahl makes a heavier duty one that may have served our purpose better. Overall it is an O.K. product.
4,Impressionistic art on my computer,"Imagine a Monet or a Van Gough on your computer screen; this software has so many beautiful images I couldn't name every work, and I thought I knew them all. Tired of seeing seascapes, animals, or nature pictures, I was delighted to find Impressionistic art as a screensaver. Turn-of-the-century art (1900) has a quality that I find hard to express but appreciate very much. If your tastes in art include the Impressionist period, this screensaver is a must-have for your collection. 25 images come to the screen illuminated by the computer, and are really quite nice to view, and are soothing to peruse. Although dated, this software is out of print; it would be nice if someone would step up to the plate and revise a new set of Impressionist art images as a screensaver so more could enjoy it."
3,"Eh, whatever.","I bought this as a beginners violin, thinking that it would be of decent enough quality for me to fiddle around on... needless to say it came with everything mentioned in its packing and in wonderful shape... it just didn't have any real manuals... and it broke, not even a few days into playing it, one of the strings popped randomly... so... I would just buy a violin from someone you can walk up to and hold it in your hands first."
4,Wonderful is Wonderful,I was traveling through Kansas City and ran across the band playing live. After the very first note I was mesmerized for the entire show. The CD that they was everything that the show offers. With intense guitar rifs throughout and excellent hooks the music will captivate. I take my hat off to a band who sounds great and is doing alot of work to get there music out. It is surely a winner
2,"Colorful, but not really very useful.","The book is colorful and the activities are o.k., but by the time you cut out and tear out and laminate all the parts and pieces, I'm not sure it's really worth it. There are probably games that are already assembled that would do the trick just as well, and they are already put together on heavier stock and ready for use. This one just wasn't worth the time it was going to take me to create the activities after I purchased the book. I think I used one activity and the rest of the book is gathering dust."
2,Charlie White,"Not the same product as the one offered seasonally at Christmas...different bottle, different smell. Do not like it, disappointed with product."
2,Not so good,"I purchased this perfume hoping to save some $'s, but I have to say that it doesn't smell so great. Very dry and powdery scent. Not at all what I expected. I didn't like Charlie when it came out because everyone was wearing it and it was cheap drugstore perfume. Over the past few years I have complimented women on their perfume and when I asked what it was they told me, ""Charlie"". Now I will try and find a sample of the original."
1,Awful,I brought 2 bottles of this spray. They do not smell like the ones I buy at local stores. The first bottle sprayer now does not even spray out. I just through it away. The 2nd bottle is still in the box. It smells awful. I usally wear this cologne everyday. I no longer can stand it.
3,Lacking detail and substance,"What makes for a good book dealing with true accounts are the vivid descriptions and details of the story, which I found lacking in this book. Very little information on the friend he shared time with, or the details of his life. Somewhat of a let down."
4,Life in Hell,"I bought this book a week ago and thus far two of my friends and myself have completed it. It's a very fast read and certainly grabs the attention of the reader.Like others have said, I also live in Thailand and suspect that some of the incidents were exaggerated or at least not explained in context. Even so, this book makes for a worthwhile read and should serve as a solid warning to anyone thinking about messing with the drug trade here."
1,St. Martin's Press - Another Fakery?,"This book has more and more improbable happenings strung together. In fact, so many I quit reading halfway through the book. Did anybody see the 60 Minutes segment about St Martin's Press in Feb. '00? The Editor in Chief admitted to Lelsly Stahl that his publishing company does NO fact checking of any kind, nor any research into the writer's background. This is the same sort of fiction that was done in their G.W. Bush biography, which the company later pulled from distribution. Unfortunatly, no one is going to bother to do the basic fact checking to disprove Fellow's rather unbelievable happenings. Don't fall for it."
1,Prison is not paradise,"I am Thai. Many of you may believe what happened to this author. But I don't believe in all the incidents.Please take a look back at prisons in your country. I have been in the US for study for 3 years. I heard lots of horrible stories about your prisons. I heard about violences in prisons, especially the from private prisons where there are not enough guards to watch inmates. I heard about guards got killed, inmates raped each other, prison breaking, drug in prisons, etc.Have you ever been to a prison in your town? Visit there some time. It may help open your narrow mind.I think it is not fair to judge a country from opinions of a man who look at the country with a bitter vision.Don't believe in what a stranger says until you can prove it yourself."
1,Awesome fiction!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This writer forgets that he did the crime and so he did the time. The writer makes it seem that prison should be a fun happy place. Well, he got what he deserved and his writings are no doubt warped by his drug soaked mind."
4,For the reviewer who said warren deserves all he gets!,"Firstly, i have to react to the imbicile who tried to reconcile himself by saying that warren only got a quarter of what he deserved....to all those thinking of buying the book, not once does warren suggest that he wasn't guilty of his crime, not once does he wallow in self pity (until realese! ) about his crime, he tries to take the time like a man......please read the book and then ask yourself "" would i of coped?""....this is truly one great book, not for its literally presence but for its sheer readabilty, it will shock you, make you laugh even reduce you to tears......but the most important thing it will do....it will make you think once, twice three four or five times about committing similar crimes...be warned!"
1,This is the sum of 12 years in a prison?,"This is more of a outline for a book than anything else. Its hard to believe that this guy wrote about 4000 days in a Thai jail and had so little to say. There is very little detail to what went on day to day or even about the author's life inside. He says that he became very good friends with a man from New York, but he mets this guy, gets to be pals with him and then the guy from NY dies in the space of just one or two pages. He never even gives a clear understanding of his Thai language skills or the relationship between the Thais and the foriegners. A reader above said that the writing was ""flawless"". No way, I am a very poor writer and have most likely made many mistakes in what your reading now. So think about it.. If a guy like me found errors in it, you know its bad."
3,A shocking story,"4000 days is extremely shocking. It shows us how amazingly low human being can get. While reading the lines, you feel that you are trapped in the jail along with a criminal that becomes a friend. At first I wanted to stop reading because it was too horrible. But I had to keep reading. I was always hoping something good would happen. A 4000 day nightmare."
3,Gripping Story,"It is hard to believe that this story is real. It seems that parts of the author's story may have really happened, but I believe that his story was exagerated. I am from Thailand, and many places he explains in this book don't even exist."
4,Thai Hell,"I found Warren Fellows description of his ordeal as harrowing yet highly compulsive,in fact I read the book from cover to cover in one session. His descriptions at the beginning of his incarceration are a severe reminder to anyone in the trafficing world that if you deal in drugs in Thailand you really are taking your life in your hands. Having recently returned from Thailand,I was amazed by its beauty but reminded of what squalid conditions lie behind the beauty of this country. An excellent read but not for anyone who is squeamish. Fellows was undoubtedly guilty of his crime yet I got the impression that he really was the pawn and suffered very heavily for it.A great read!"
4,sorry i missed this bit out!,"just for the record...the book title in England is ""The damage done""...not 4000 days, just in case you were wondering! ;)"
4,Good book for anyone who thinks their life is tough.,This book is powerful and an easy read. Fellows' story is well worth it
3,Don't do the crime if you can't do the time,"Implausibilities abound in this 200 page story of life in a Bangkok prison. Some of the accounts are no doubt cooked up by an altered mind admittedly hooked on heroin for most of his twelve year incarceration, with some parts reading like an Edgar Allan Poe drug-induced story.Warren Fellows obviously has a chip on his shoulder about Thailand, and his 20 year old dated accounts of Bangkok overlook the fact that Thailand is now a safe tourist Mecca that is anything BUT dangerous for all but the drug smuggling visitor.The final message is one that most Americans should already know - the penalty for drug use overseas is far too great to risk getting caught. If you don't believe that, or you like reading about wild adventures gone terribly wrong, then this book is for you."
4,Gets the job done...,"This book is a decent beginners book, but I feel that it isn't exactly for the absolute beginner. The challenges at the end of each chapter could be a lot better, they don't completely test comprehension of all concepts in the chapter. If you are already familiar with another programming language, this is a good book to get you started with C++."
5,The Best Available,"This is the best currently available recording of this music. The ABQ play with true passion and commitment in both of these highly Romantic works. By contrast, both the brilliant Leipzig Quartet and the Arditi Quartet recordings of the same pieces are both too cool and detatched, though the program notes on their cds are much more detailed than EMI's. This recording is now hard to find, but it's certainly worth looking for. The ABQ's performances of these pieces are also included on a DG compilation of Berg's music, though I don't know if that recording is the same as this. EMI's sound is excellent."
4,"The best electric toothbrush ever, except...","I am not inclined to write product reviews but this toothbrush is really great. I've used electric toothbrushes for decades. My last Braun ebrush died and I search for a replacement. This one was more expensive but having used it I have to say it was well worth the extra money.The one thing I really dislike about the product is the electrical plug's ""wall wart"" - it juts out much more than any I've ever seen."
4,"Scrubs good, just a button gets in the way","My teeth are now really clean and the gums get a good workout. I think my dentist will be happy, especially with the back sides of the teeth which the hygenist usually has to really pick at during the cleanings. My only problem is that the button which changes the speed/mode of the brush is easily pressed accidentally while brushing. To make sure I don't press it, I have to consciously move my hand farther down on the handle than I would naturally grab it. But that's not really a big problem."
4,Better than the Sonicare,"Basically there are only 2 types of motorized toothbrushes that you should look at and they are the Sonicare and the Oral-B. I used the Sonicare for about 1.5 years and thought it was working well until my dentist told me that I was starting to have receding gums. While I cannot blame the Sonicare, in my opinion I think the Oral B is gentler on your gums. There is also a ""mild"" setting which is easier on your gums which is not an option on the Sonicare."
2,Good while it lasted; Won't be buying another.,"Our family has used the Oral-B power toothbrushes for several years now. The original model lasted a good 3+ years with heavy use. We bought this model as a replacement, but it lasted not much more than a year. It simply stopped working one day. Judging by the moisture that was getting into the LED screen, I suspected that it suffered a short. Thinking that it was just a defective unit, we went out and bought the same model. This time, it came with two of the power toothbrushes. In less than 6 months use, one of the brushes has already died. It suffered the same problem as the first, with moisture getting inside the brush. One would expect a toothbrush to be waterproof. It's very apparent that these brushes are not. It's a shame because they do a very effective job of cleaning teeth. I will be looking at alternatives now."
4,Excellent Product,The Oral B Triumph 400 tooth brush is better than I expected. Great for cleaning teeth and my gums are stronger.
4,Oral B Toothbrush Review,"product appears to be running as it should, the only reason I say this is the last Oral B purchased, a Professional 7000 series has never worked as it should.. Thought we would try their product one more time..."
1,power toothbrush,very excellent design and operation which provides good resultsin cleaning teeth. I am concerned about obtaining replacement brushesfor unit. Would reccomend this to everyone.
5,I'm impressed!,"My face is shaped like Joni Mitchell's: Prominent cheekbones and large teeth. It's really tight in there, and I guess I have been brushing my gums into thier own little resession! Since I have used the Triumph my teeth still feel smooth and clean as they did after my hygienist visit. As for the claim that it gets between your teeth, well, that depends on how crowded together the teeth are. The brush head is a little big to fit between my cheek and gums, so I have to pull my cheek out to give it room. It's also kind of spattery, especially when you are doing the backs of your front teeth. I guess I am still getting used to using it, but guess what...I actually look forward to brushing my teeth! It signals you to move every 30 seconds to a different area, but I am never finished in time because of the contortions I have to go through to get it to fit in my mouth. But it makes my mouth feel so clean that I hate to eat anything between meals- so maybe it doubles as a weight loss aid!!"
5,Very clean teeth!!!,I bought 2 toothbrushes for my son and for myself. We have been using them for a couple of weeks and we just love how clean our teeth feel all day!!!It feels like you just left the dentist's!I can recommend this toothbrush to everyone!
2,Loud and heavy,"I got this new Oral B brush after my last one died in Europe (apparently it was a victim of European voltage differences). I was looking for a while and trying to decide between the Oral B and Sonic Care, which my girlfriend had been using for years. I really liked my old Oral B, and had been using it for about 2 years. So when I saw that this new version had come out, and it had a voltage regulator to support voltages around the world, I thought I was set. It was a big disappointment when I first turned it on. It's got to be one of the loudest toothbrushes out there - sounds like a drill or some other powertool when it's running. It's probably 2-3 times louder than my original Oral B. The other problem is that the handle is much thicker and much heavier than the previous model. I have small hands and found it to be cumbersome to hold, not to mention just too heavy. I think the engineers at Oral B went overboard on this model."
3,Fabulous Brush! Lousy Technology!,"This tooth brush is fabulous and has saved me a lot of money in dental bills, but I am currently on my 3rd brush in one year! The experience I've had is that the LCD screen retains moisture then the brush will die. The first brush I tried to change the battery, and as the review by R.Ocamp/leonpro points out under ""Cons #8,"" once you open the mechanism that voids the warranty. My 2nd brush did the same, but I didn't open the brush and got a replacement via my destist, which I have had for the last 3 months and so far so good (knock on wood). I've been wiping the brush after every use and I don't keep it in the bathroom for fear of moisture."
1,"BATTERY IS ""NOT"" REPLACEABLE DO NOT BUY!!!","The entire braun pro series DOES NOT OFFER BATTERY REPLACEMENT!!! $160 for a toothbrush and you have to throw it out after the battery dies??? Proctor & Gamble strikes again. Throw it away and buy another one is exactly what braun customer service told me!!!PLEASE CALL BRAUN CS 800-566-5752 ask about battery replacement. this is truly a horrible thing. THrow it away in the landfill after 2 years, with the metal hydride battery (again in the landfill) all because P&G; wants you to buy a new $160 toothbrush always instead of a $5 battery.DO NOT BUY!!!"
4,Liked it until it failed,"Dentists had been recommending power brushes to me for years. Finally I broke down and bought this one. The reviews for the Triumph and the Sonicare were both great - I chose this one because the brush head is smaller.I've had this for a little less than a year and I really like it. My teeth feel cleaner than ever and my gums feel better. I also like the polishing mode.I would definitely purchase this again.UPDATE 11-28-08: This thing stopped working last week. I had it for maybe two years, and I do not think that is acceptable. I liked it, but it didn't hold a charge for very long, and now it won't charge at all.I just ordered a Sonicare. I hope that lasts longer and works as well. This is WAY too much money to spend on something that lasts about two years. If it would let me, I would change my rating to two stars. It did a great job, but now it's useless."
2,Very Different from Sonicare,"I previously used a Sonicare Elite for several years, on the advice of my dentist. It was wearing out so I wanted to try something new. The reviews for the Oral-B were very good so I bought it. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.I guess I should have realized the Oral-B was a rotating motor type toothbrush, and I was used to the tiny sonic pulses from the Sonicare. BIG DIFFERENCE. With the Oral-B, I felt like my mouth was being drilled upon, and my whole head vibrated. The brush head was very large and cumbersome for me.I ended up going to a local store and buying the Sonicare Flexcare, which is not the cheapest one out there, but returned to the sonic pulses and extremely clean feeling after brushing teeth. No head vibrations! Smaller brush head with softer bristles, good for sensitive teeth or gums.In defense of the Oral-B, the toothbrush did clean my teeth well. I just didn't like the jarring motion compared to the Sonicare."
5,Strongly recommend the Oral B Triumph,"I immediately noticed two things once I begun using the Oral B triumph over a manual brush. First, it has never been so easy to brush the hard to reach areas of your mouth - the combination of the long head and powerful brushing really made me notice a difference in the back. Secondly me teath never felt this clean before, this brush just left my mouth feeling clean. I recommend anyone thinking about switching to a powered brush from a manual to give it a try - you won't be dissappointed."
5,Terrific Product,"Claims aside, this is the only toothbrush I've used that's truly made a noticeable difference."
3,Oreal B Triumph Toothbrush Professional 9400 Power Toothbrush,"I would have rated this toothbrush higher were it not for several deficiencies in design. In general it is a nice looking device, very stylish, if you're into that. It is also very easy to clean, not like the competition Philips Sonicare device, which is terrible to keep clean. The Oral B's brush heads are cheaper too. It seems to brush adequately, but not better than Sonicare in my estimation. The Oral B's control buttons are far too easy to hit while brushing, changing its mode, even turning it off. As far as the modes are concerned, I find that only one, the default one, is really necessary. Finally, the brush head is not provided with a cover or shield as is Sonicare`s."
3,nice clean,"good speed, but the brush head is oval shaped and larger than the usual oral b (i've been an oral b user for the last several yrs) i'd been using so it was a bit harder to manipulate around the teeth and mouth. plus, the bristles wore down a lot faster too. however, still a good purchase b/c i like that it does clean a bit better than the older models."
5,Excellent product,"I bought this toothbrush after reading all the positive reviews, and am really glad I did! As a long-time Oral-B customer -- I previously used one of their inexpensive power brushes -- stepping up to one much more expensive wasn't something I was ready to do without some investigation. But I'm glad I took that step, because this model is far superior to the one I had before, and well worth its cost.I've yet to test out the length of time this will last between rechargings, but I'm pleased with the performance and quality of this product."
3,Great brush but...,"This is infact a good brush but not upto the mark as expected.Pro's:As everyone stated, it has great featuresCon's:a) Though its a great brush, there is something missing.b) Battery life is not that good, though they have stated as 2 weeks, i could hardly get a weekc) There are no. of brushing modes, but only one speedBottom line is, i am not completely statisfied with it though its good."
3,THIS PRODUCT STOPS WORKING,I WILL BE RETURNING THE ORAL B TRIUMPH PROFESSIONAL TOOTHBRUSH AND THE ADDITIONAL BRUSHES. THE ELECTRIC BRUSG WILL STOP DURING THE USING AND IT'S VERY ANNOYING. IT WILL BE RETURNED A.S.A.P. JOEL M HAYWARD
1,waste money,"I paid about 100 dollars for it. I am angry at this toothbrush now, because handle didn't work at all after charging a battery at the beginning after then one month later handle itself ran without an operation until the battery was completely discharged. I couldn't stop it. I also tried to remove the battery by the presented instruction. Anyway, I don't want to buy this product any more, even though it is currently a good reputation."
3,works really really good,"I have been usig it for 1 week it works wonderful but very expensive. I guess it is worth it, time will tell."
3,Oral-B Triumph Professional Care,For full performance you have to charge battery every day. And on my toothbrush display didn't work and I had to send it to a service.
2,Don't Buy...Many problems,"I have had my Triumph Professional Care 9000 for less than 2 years (came with multiple handles). This is the second time that one of them stopped working. The first time it broke soon after I purchased and was able to return. Now this time my handle says it's charging but as soon as I remove it NOTHING!!So, now I have to contact a authorized service provided -- which took a lot of hunting on the web site to find for a phone #, then to only be lead to another web site, with more phone #'s. What happen to customer service?Buyer Beware...I do love the battery operated toothbrush but you may want to pick another brand."
4,It's like taking your brushing to a new level,"We used to use the Oral B rotary toothbrushes, but after brushing the first time with this, we realized the amazing difference in thoroughness with cleaning. I especially like the polisher head that comes with it - it really removes all the rough spots that tend to accumulate with time on the surface of the teeth that toothbrushes don't seem to completely remove. Try it - you won't be disappointed."
5,Fantastic Toothbrush!,"The Oral-B Triumph Professional Care Power Toothbrush is wonderful. It is everything it is advertised to be and better than previous models of Oral-B Power Toothbrushes. After one brushing my teeth felt smoother and cleaner than they did using the Oral-B 7550 Professional Care Power Toothbrush and the Oral-B Triumph cleaned my teeth very well, yet at the same time it is not harsh or damaging. It is a magnificent toothbrush and I am glad I purchased it."
5,Braun Triumph 9400 Power Professional Care Toothbrush,"I am very happy with my new Braun Triumph 9400 Power Professional Care Toothbrush. It is quality, good looking, works perfectly. The price was very good. I like how it times out 4 quadrants of your teeth and lets you know when to move to another part of your teeth and lets you know when 2 minutes are done. I love the optional types of brushes and the different speeds. It is everything it says it is.Thank you. Tim"
5,Awesome,This product is great. We have a head for each person. You won't go back to a regular brush.
4,good product,This is a great toothbrush. My new dental hygenist recommended it. The dental office was selling a fancier version for $100.00 but this one is sufficient. The only thing it doesn't need is the cover for the brushes as the surface under the toothbrushes began to smell musty from no air flow within the first week. I just removed it permanently.
2,Great when it worked,This was a great toothbrush while it worked. I've only had this tooth brush for 4 months and the handle now out of control. It just wouldn't shut off one day. I finally realized if you put it back in the charger is shuts down. It now won't turn back on. I'm going to try and get a replacement but I don't have much confidence in the product.
3,My Sonicare was better...,"I was disappointed after I began to use this and went for a checkup, the dentist said I wasn't cleaning good enough and when I had the sonicare, all good reports from the dentist. The carring case is nice and the set looks fancy. I don't even use the polishing mechanism because I can't find any polish...or maybe I am supposed to just use toothpaste?"
4,Oral-B Triumph Professional Care 9400 Power Toothbrush,"Great product! You can truly feel the effect it has on your teeth! However, this particualr package came with out the Smart Guide, which was quite dissappointing."
2,I prefer the sonicare,"I bought this because a friend recommended it and from searching the web, it seemed like dentists recommend this toothbrush more than the sonicare ones. But after using it for a month or so, I feel like the sonicare was better for my teeth. This brush is pretty rough on your teeth--it feels like it's grinding them down when I use it, even though I'm not really even pressing the brush to my teeth."
4,"Gives you that nice, KLEEN feeling.","After many years of laziness, I've finally bought this power toothbrush. I should have done this long ago. Not only does it do all the work for me, but the built in timer has actually gotten me to brush longer than I used to with any other brush. Floss action head actually gets some of the stuff in-between the teeth too. Not a replacement for flossing, but still nice.Only downside as I see it is the hard plastic that the actual brush is made out of. Every time the back of the brush touches a tooth, I get a very interesting sensation that runs all the way down my spine.Overall, a solid product."
5,awesome product,"this is seriously a great toothbrush. i reviewed a whole bunch of electronic toothbrushes to see which one stood out above the others. and this one claimed to be the best. i was so excited to get it and when i used it, it definitely lived up to its expectations. your teeth feel soo clean after using it, like you just came back from the dentist! the best part abt this toothbrush, aside from the cool timer and different settings, is the holder. i know, sounds pointless, but i like the fact that it can hold multiple brushes right there in the stand and has a cover to close it. im some what of a germ-a-phobe when it comes to toothbrushes being near other toothbrushes, so this is great! haha. and it's got a nifty lil travel case too. what more could u ask for ;o)"
3,Pain of an off system,"A complicated running system where it should simply shut itself off, it does not, I find it quite irksome."
2,Worse than I thought,"The toothbrush is loud, slow and the round brush head is not as effective as the regular oblong brush. Wish I could return it. The twenty-dollar toothbrush you find in any drugstore is much superior to this brush with bells and whistles and little else..."
5,best electric toothbrush ever had,this brush cleans and brightens better than other Oral-B brushes I had before
1,Makes teeth sensitive,"Using this brush made my teeth very sensitive. I figure it erodes the enamel. As you know tooth enamel once lost does not rebuild. I stopped using the toothbrush around a year back, but my teeth are still sensitive. I regret ever buying this brush. In fact I am not going to buy a electric toothbrush ever. Manual brushes are the best."
2,Rechargeable Throw Away,"I am extremely disappointed in the Braun Triumph 9000. I purchased it on 3/04/2006 and now the battery will not charge. I followed the care instructions and did a discharge every 6 months hoping that the battery would last a little longer, but it still will not charge correctly. I called Braun customer service and explained the problem and was told the handle is no longer good. they said they only last about 5 years. Perhaps Braun should advise the consumer that the unit is going to be disposed of in 5 years. I was offered a $10 dollar coupon or a replacement handle that would cost $60. It is very frustrating to have to purchase another handle when the whole unit costs about $100.(Sam's club) I have to really think about purchasing another Braun brush verses another similar product by another manufacturer. Perhaps I will get more than 5 years out of another company."
5,The best,"Really I have tried many electrical toothbrushes, but Oral B 9400 is the best. Thank you very much"
5,Dentist clean,"The other reviews don't lie, this is a great product and I think it works so well. Even the features are nice and feel pretty useful."
5,Great product,"We are very pleased with the 9400. It does a superb job and every time you use it , it feels like a dentist just cleaned your teeth."
5,Works well,"I bought this primarily on price (secondarily based on reviews) to replace my Philips unit that died many months back. After going without and electric toothbrush my exams got progressively worse, so I began shopping around for a new unit. This one works well; no surpises. It feels different than the Sonicare - more aggressive to my senses. It's easier to clean and dry, and the LCD battery level indicator is nice (no surpises).No regrets buying it."
5,Love it!,"Great quality and even better results. I appreciate that the overkill plastic base is optional, and you choose to keep only the slim charging base. Feels good in the hand and is very responsive."
5,Best Toothbrush,"I've used every type of toothbrush available and this is by far my favorite. It has amazing power and after the first cleaning, I could feel a difference all day. It's been 2 weeks and I can see a huge difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I love this toothbrush!"
4,Best Xmas gift,I received this as a Christmas gift. I currently use a standard Oral- B but the Triumph was alot more powerful. It really is dentist feeling clean. I liked the 2 minute timer. and the smile face that pops up. It's the little things in life that make me smile. LOL I'm so happy I got this as a gift!
5,the shiznik yo!,"check this yo, this album be the bomb! when sittin on chrome be playin and i be pimpin my ride yo, damn!, it's on then."
1,I hate the ICE alert,"When the temp drops below freezing, an alarm sounds and you have to press a button to shut it off. There appears to be NO WAY to disable this alarm - how stupid can they be at Oregon Scientific? Here in Colorado, the temp fluctuates quite a bit and that darn alarm is too annoying. We won't be keeping this."
1,What alarm can't be disabled? This one.,Totally agree with the other comments posted here..the head engineer must've been out to lunch when this product launched. There's no way to turn off the precipitation alarm! I used the method suggested here (switch the sensor to Channel 2) otherwise this thing's going straight in the garbage...I wouldn't even give it to goodwill.
1,Unusable because of ice alarm,"I agree with the other reviews. The unit generally works reasonably well, until the temperature approaches freezing. Then an alarm goes off every 10 seconds or so. Its totally useless and ruins the unit.I bought this over the summer and didn't notice this problem until winter. So I'm well past any return timeframe.I'd avoid this unit. Its a totally useless time bomb which will render the unit unusable when winter arrives.Oregon scientific should do a recall and replace all the units to remove the alarm."
5,Very happy,I appreciated the timely delivery and the consistency of the labeling of the product with the actual product. I am a happy Amazon customer
1,Showalter is a fraud,"I wouldn't believe anything this charlatan has written. This is the same woman who wrote Hystories, in which claimed ME/CFIDS was hysteria like people who claimed they were abducted by aliens. There are over 5,000 articles in peer reviewed scientific journals showing frank biological pathology."
2,Good parole video,"This video has some great footage of Ms Van Houghton's parole hearing. Also footage from Manson's hearing. It was disappointing in the fact that there wasn't any new information. Not to mention the fact that the writers couldn't get the names of the ""family"" correct. They didn't even research far enough to put the correct name to the face in the video clips. This was a disapointment from Court TV."
4,Nice DVD of Stevie Ray Vaughan,"If you're a Stevie Ray Vaughan fan, this DVD has to be in your collection. I have all the others (Live at El Mocambo, etc.), but this one is special because it's up close and personal with Albert King, just the two jammin' together. A must have."
5,SRV Albert King,"I have the SACD of this event, to see them playing in the video brings it all home. Great stuff. too bad the things done today is called music, it's an insult to the greats like SRV and Albert King. This is a well done video, very clean, clear, well done. If ya like great guitar playing, by 2 greats, as they work off each other. this is the one to see."
3,Missing 2 great tunes,This is a mixed blessing. Finally a LEGIT DVD release. Pristine picture and sound. BUT it is missing BLUES at SUNRISE and DONT ASK ME NO QUESTIONS and OVERALL JUNCTION. I know for a fact this footage exists and why it is absent I can only guess; they did not want to pay royalties for them. So killer footage but sadly INCOMPLETE. A missed opportunity for the definitive edition. Too bad.
4,Not a bad read!,"This book wasn't bad. It gave very good descriptions to create a very creepy atmosphere. I'm not sure if I buy Michael Myers GROWLING, but I can deal with it. Two very good sequences involve one of the characters' house alarm mysteriously going off, and Michaels' stalking of kids at a Halloween dance. A big plus in helping this book is the fact that the main characters sound like real people. Real kids dealing with real issues. So through that you care about them, which adds to the tension level. Of course this book doesn't equal the movies, but for a good case of the creeps, it's definately worth a try. I look foward to reading the other books in the series."
3,an interesting thriller/horror,"Haloween the scream factory was an interesting horror thriller with good suspense, great deaths, good characters, and a bad ending. The book overall was good but I thought she at least could have ended it with him being caught, sent back to smith's grove, and in the next book make it the same characters from the first book come back in the second. I think that the other books ahead look really good though."
4,Review from the PostgRaduate Medical Journal,"""The subject of this book, written by a general practitioner and research psychologist, is probably more pertinent today than at any other time in the past. Stress in primary health care professionals is so common that almost every general practice will have had some experience o it first hand. The book is reasonably easy to read and contain extensive analysis and references. It will therefore be particularly useful to readers who have an academic interest in stress related problems... This book will provide a useful...addition to a general practice library.""- L. Tapper-Jones, Roath House Surgery"
2,Pretty Pictures,"This is a coffee table book, with lots of big, full-page color pictures and relatively few recipes. In addition, many of the recipes call for ingredients that are hard to obtain."
2,Much louder than the Cadet Register Plus,"Just too loud. Don't put in bedroom or tv room. Cadet Register Plus much quieter.Cadet Register Plus Heater - 120 Volts, 500/1000/1500 Watts, Model# RMC151W"
4,A Good Movie,"We enjoyed this movie, it was not what it appeared to be in the beginning. Helen Hunt was truly a ""Good Woman"" in spite of her lifestyle. I recommend this movie, might even watch it again."
2,Wrong Cast,I didn't like Helen Hunt being cast in this part. She is a good actress but I didn't feel she looked the part of the character. I would rather have seen someone more attractive - Helen is too bony and plain.
3,A clean adult movie,"Beautiful setting, and wonderful acting by Helen Hunt and Tom Wilkinson. Nice adaptation of Oscar Wilde's ""Lady Windemere's Fan"" with interesting plot twists and witty banter. And though an adult drama, it has more ""suggestion"" than the modern movies that usually leave nothing to the imagination. I felt we learned the story of these people without having to know all of their intimate details. Hallelujah. One of the fun lines: ""You've been buying into idle gossip. I suggest you ask for a refund."""
5,nice. quite nice.,short movie. very understandable and to the point. funny and very interesting. the banter that goes on b/t people in the movie is very entertaining and thought-provoking. provides ample subject matter for a long and interesting discussion b/t viewers.very nice movie.
1,Not very Entertaining,"This was too slow for me...just wasn't my type. Th is more of a lady's movies, one for a very slow day."
1,Yuck,"This was a very poorly made and very poorly cast film. Helen Hunt had zero charisma... she could NOT carry the film, wish I spent my evening watching bowling or something. Though some may claim the Italian setting was worth watching....this is NOT True. Go bowling, you will thank me later!"
2,terrible movie!,"I don't generally write movie reviews, but this one was so bad I couldn't help myself. The characters seemed one-dimensional, and none of them were believable. Dialogue was lacking and artificial. All the principal actors (especially Helen Hunt)--who were such great artists in other movies--really flopped in this one. Maybe they had a hard time believing the horrible dialogue coming out of their mouths. The only redeeming quality of this moving is its setting in the Amalfi Coast."
3,Nice costumes and scenery...,"The acting, by the women, was rather bad though. I've never been a fan of Johansson or Hunt, but both were quite miscast, I think. At least Helen Hunt as the seductress or woman of mystery, should have been a little more charismatic, but I felt like she was simply reading lines with minor inflection(the minimal with which, frankly, Johansson couldn't seem to be bothered). Fortunately, Tom Wilkinson could be relied upon to make the most of his, sadly smallish, part. I will give the film three stars nonetheless, as I like the story, setting, and costumes, and the male actors(sounds very sexist, but I'm a woman which makes it doubly hard to admit Hunt and Johansson's failings;)To be fair, I have seen her give a much more spirited performance in 'Vicki Christina Barcelona', maybe this just wasn't the right part for her."
3,"Surprisingly clean, but acting fell flat","I was surprised how clean the movie was, but the delivery of lines was surprisingly flat. A shame, because this is a lavish film (visually) with plenty of good actors and pithy lines."
2,Just to pass the time - Nothing exceptionnal,Just to pass the time - Nothing exceptionnal. The story is great but the film could have been better with more emotions
3,Felt Helen Hunt acting was not up to par...too much of the same as in other films I have seen.,"The story was interesting, but again, Helen Hunt seemed miscast as the femme fetale'...on the other hand I felt S. Johansan did a great job."
4,Surprisingly funny too!,Very enjoyable. A little slower pace movie so you need to be in the mood for that. Helen Hunt and Scarlet Johanson are not the stars of the movie however. The male actors steal the show at times.
2,Sorry movie,I am a big movie fan and especially period pieces but this was a sorry movie! Helen Hunt delivered her lines with less emotion than a waitress behind the counter of Denny's. Her voice tones are great for sarcasm but for meaning and depth lines it stinks.Johansson was as pale as a ghost. Sure she was a very young innocent but she needed some rouge. I also thought she looked downright ugly and dowdy in this movie. Altho the costumes were beautiful she was an ugly ducklying standout.The whole movie lacked the delicate touch and nuance a Wilde story should have. Helen Hunt was the biggest standout as missed casting. She may do in cutting edge stories in 2000 but not in this period piece.The scenery and costumes were about the only redeeming factor in this movie.
4,Helen Hunt does a great job!!,I like Helen Hunt and she is great in this movie. It was an interesting story with an interesting setting.I loved the story and the suspense filled ending.
1,Trite,"This could have been a wonderful period piece, which could have happened with better cast and dialogue. Came off trite and stilted - definitely not worth the hour and a half or so to watch. Bummer."
2,Total ripoff of Wilde's other works,"Viturally every other sentence is borrowed/stolen from Wilde's other works. ""The Portrait of Dorian Gray"" seems to be a favorite of this film's writer. Uninspired, to say the least!"
1,Huge Disappointment,"This movie has a predictable, formulaic plot, is terribly acted (especially by Hunt and Johannson), and has little to no character development. The movie would have been a little more engaging if the audience knew much earlier that the husband was not having an affair; the audience could have empathized more with the husband's struggle to protect his wife instead of writing him off as an adulterer, and the misunderstanding between husband and wife would have had a bit more suspense. A very big disappointment."
3,A good time filler,It never really grabbed my heart but it was more fun watching this than washing dishes. Helen Hunt did not exactly look the part of a seductress but her looks made believable the point that Johannsen was her daughter. It was a good movie.
2,"""A Good Woman""","The movie is about a man who ""betrays"" his wife by having an affair with another woman. Sadly, this is what has become very common today.A movie about adultry; no thanks."
2,Scarlett Johansson actress?,"Scarlett Johansson ""actress"" (as much as Vanessa Johansson) actually is a clone from original person Scarlett Galabekian last name, who has nothing with acting career, surname Galabekian, because of adoption happened in 1992. Clones was created illegally by using stolen biological material. Original person is very nice (not d**n sexy), most important - CHRISTIAN young lady! I'll tell you more, those clones (it's not only one) made in GERMANY - world leader manufacturer of humans clones, it is in Ludwigshafen am Rhein, Rhineland-Palatinate, Mr. Helmut Kohl home town"
1,Not really a Generationship story,"This story is not logical in that after 2000 years everybody on the ark seems to be happy with their lot in life. No mutinee, no drug problems, no psychotics nor neurotics on board. I am not sure what the author meant this story to be about except some fantasy about Wolf Angels sneeking onto the ship. The science is non-existent, no character developement and no plot. Must have had friends write the rave reviews for him on Amazon. I won't even consider purchasing the second book, not worth the money. There are alot of good Ark/Generationship stories to be read but this is not one of them."
2,The cd when Clarke entered his Funk/George Benson period,"As someone who enjoys early to mid 70's Parliament and Funkadelic, cuts 1, 2, 6 are in that league being a mixture Funk and fusion with a touch of hard rock, and soul thrown inAs someone who does not enjoy later discoish Parliament,Funkadelic and George Benson's crooning ""breezin"" stuff, cuts 3, 4, 5 and 7 fit in that mold.There is very little similarities in this cd with his jazz stuff done in Return to Forever or individual cds being ""Stanley Clarke"", ""school days"", ""if this bass could talk"""
1,STOOOOOPID AND CORNY!!!!,"What the devil was Stanley thinking here?OK, I could understand going more in a saleable R&B; direction but MAN, this was over-the-top corniness of the worst kind, bombastic pseudo-rock/funk arrangements mixed with lame, pointless corny cutting-up and Stanley doing a rather bad parody of himself. And what's up with that idiotic cover with Stanley on a STONE MOTORCYCLE!!???I have to admit I lost a lot of respect for Stanley as an artist after hearing this abomination, (and it wasn't until hearing 1989's ""If This Bass Could Only Talk"" that my respect for Stan as a musician came back in spades). Unfortunnately, ""Rocks Pebbles and Sand"" was only the beginning of the long 1980's Schlock-Fest that Stanley would unleash (no doubt at the behest of his record company).Skip this turkey altogether, unless you are a masochist at heart."
4,Sweet piece,"This is the first thing we bought, after deciding on the Starlight theme. It's helped us pick paint colors and given us a feel for the room. It's sweet for the nursery yet not cheesy. For the rest of the line, we will register!"
3,Informative AND dry.,"Some of the tapes are quite informative, but at least one is too focused on one topic. The tape devoted to Saddam is in the neighborhood of an hour long, and frankly, Saddam doesn't have an hours worth of information in him. It is an hour of ""Poor me, Evil America"" etc. The tape devoted to General Schwarzkopf also runs a bit longer than necessary, but at least he has a personality.The other tapes are an in depth study of the war from every perspective, and make for a very educational video series. Bottom line is, this series of videos is worth about 30 to 35 bucks. It is unfortunate that CNN did not make this available on DVD."
3,Didn't do much for me,"Interesting concept, but did not do much for me since my problem is medical. Encourages healthy eating, which I already do."
1,Item not received,My order was never received. And I was not notified as to why I would not be receiving it.
4,Best deal,"I have several sport / big sizes watch, but none of this brand.This one is the best deal I've made up to now.Great sport look but still elegant (doesn't look cheap), robust,...Good deal to me. I think I'll buy other Nautica watches in teh future."
3,"Ideal for vacation,...except,..","Watch is of good quality, nothing cheap about it.However,..problem is that several functions don't work as described.Cannot change the Date.Cannot change the bands either. Followed instructions and it just doesn't happen.Might need to take it to a jeweler ?I bought it for my upcoming Cruise, so I can wear it at the beach or pool, and then change the Bands for dinner.So, I'll need to wear the orange band with a suit in the evening.Not exactly what I had in mind. If jeweler cannot correct I may opt to return it.R.P."
4,Made a believer,"This book changed the way I see J.F.K.'s assasination. You will never believe the Warren Report, after this one. M.L.H."
4,TALK ABOUT A MARATHON!!!!,"I'm exhausted. By the time I reached the finish I'd forgotten the start. Look, Great facts, alot of research, but I found this book mentally fatiguing. If you are in to conspiracies get it. Meanwhile, I'm going to go lay and rest my head."
3,Short on facts,"A lot research was done for this book. Having sid that, there are a lot of assumptions made that were not based in fact. Maybe Marcello was not an angel but he did many good deeds for people in need and that should be brought out with the rest of the story. He was also a good family man. A very interesting book"
4,A good introduction to the natural history of US forests.,"This book provides some fascinating information on the natural history of the major tree species of the east and central U.S. While some species are covered in much greater detail than others, and other species are completely excluded from mention, the book is still fascinating reading for those interested in the commercial uses, wildlife value, and historical impact that trees have had in this area of the world."
4,Hemingway's Paris,Interesting book about Hemingway's haunts in the Paris of the 1920's. Should be a very useful guide to literary walks in the City of Light.
5,Best guide for everyone diving Bali,This is an outstanding and reliable resource on diving in Bali. The author writes with clarity. It is an enjoyable read even if you can get out there as often as you'd like. Worth reading!
4,Taurine for cats (and skunks!),"I purchased this item because I have a pet skunk, and he requires Taurine. It really isn't that easy to find, so I bought 2 bottles to last me for a good long while. The skunk apparently likes the taste, because he gobbles the 1/2 pills down! Gee, a medication for an animal that you don't have to force feed!! <GG> Can't say how cats would like it though, but if you happen to have a skunk for a pet, don't hesitate buying this product. It's reasonable in price, and shipping was reasonable and fast too!"
2,GMO SOY??,"I bought these pills for making my own cat food; however, they contain hydrolyzed soy protein, which is not something I want to feed my cats. It is probably made from GMO soy as well. I was sorry that I didn't check it out more thoroughly."
1,Unprecedented Scholarship?,"Let's hope so! If all ""scholarship"" was this shallow, we'd be in a lot of trouble. Are these the ONLY writings of the Father's on these particular verses? No? Then why give these? I tell you, I used this book for a class, sight unseen, because the idea of the series was brilliant. Thankfully, I used the real texts (Loeb Classical) as well, and was able to see (1) how bad the translations are in places (reads like the NIV, hmmmmm, wonder why) and (2) how unrepresentative of so many of the views of the Patristic writers on many of the issues this commentary is. You want examples? No space here, fortunately. The only thing less instructive about these idealogically-driven books is my rambling critique of them. Thankfully, I make no claim to have ""international scope"" in my review! Skip these volumes, the others in the series are no better. Read the original texts, draw your own conclusions."
1,What a shame,"The translations go on unabated, and I really hate to give this volume a bad review. It is such a good idea. But this terribly abridged and oddly selected series of translations (good translations, I have to say, that is the one star) is not the way to go about it. We need a REAL and BROAD set of ancient Christian commentaries. These won't do."
2,"Hutz is great, but you don't need to spend over an hour for someone else to tell you that - listen to one of his albums instead","This was an interesting take on the documentary of a rock star. the film is the filmmaker's fangirl crush expounded into an hour long feature that attempts to trace the lead singer of Gogol Bordello's roots and musical influences. The film suffers and simultaneously benefits from the dichotomy of being the movie that allows Eugene Hutz's fans a more intimate look at his beginnings and being a venue for the filmmaker to get back into Hutz's life. In offering a more personal view and explaining her stake in the story, Pavla Fleischer manages to show how charismatic Hutz is but she is ultimately unable to provide any deeper insight into her main subject because she is too busy moping around about not becoming his love interest."
3,Not so good...,I am a HUGE Gogol Bordello fan; I have seen them live and watched other documentaries on them but this documentary was crap. It is a really short film. Nothing really happens and you learn nothing about Eugene or the band. Basically a girl falls in love with Eugene and he doesn't feel the same way. They just tour some gypsy camps and sing songs. It is worth watching but not buying. Unfortunately I bought it. Maybe I am being too harsh but I was expecting more.
2,Sucks. Really sucks.,"It gets two stars because it works like it is suppose to, but it is really very quite, and I had to adjust the the striker and the throw to get it to sound like a bell. Really poor sounding still, the striker is made from a really soft metal and it just can't hit the bell hard enough and it bends out of shape rather quickly."
4,"Louder than the 3"" Bell","You can find bells similar to this but with a 3"" bell at a range of places. That one isn't loud enough. This one is a bit louder."
2,Very loud,This bell is very loud when used with a 16vac transformer. When rung it shakes so much the cover pops off every time. The punch-out for the wires is more like a cut out with a grinder.
2,Only buss from the bell,The bell does not ring it buzzes. In addition to making an unpleasant sound it is not very loud even when mounted on wood.
3,Super cute,I love the looks of this doorbell. I was really inexpensive but that does show up in the quality of the materials used to make it. Kind of light weight. Really loud!
4,Undervalued significance,"Well worth the investment for any serious Davis/Coltrane fans, this pretty good recording features the '60 quintet in fine, fiery form, with Coltrane's meaty sax solo's taking front stage to completely complimentary accompaniment. This was especially an interesting listen for Trane-ologists, as you can hear the master musician just on the cusp of breaking forward to his more progressive-leaning phase, while still completely rooted in tradition- a stage some would maintain was his golden medium."
3,Attractive but not enough light,"This is an attractive, well built fan that fits perfectly into my kitchen which has a 1950's stove, fridge and sink. However, the amount of light is insufficient. It could be corrected with a different glass dome - if one existed, a clear glass could make all the difference. The manufacturer could increase the number of bulbs in this fan, but for those of us who already own this model, we need another option."
4,stop the itch,"works good, my dog stopped itching right away. It has lasted quite some time since I sprayed her. She was absolutely miserable before I treated her."
3,English-Gaelic only...,"I guess I assumed that this was a conventional bilingual dictionary (i.e. provides translations for both English and Gaelic words). It is, as a more careful shopper than myself might notice, called an English-Gaelic dictionary, and it is that only. Mia Culpa, but I bought it to help with translations from Gaelic into English for research purposes. It is, though, quite up to date, perhaps much more up to date than most readers of Gaelic so that you can send them running to a dictionary to figure out what you're talking about... though they'd have trouble figuring it out with this text."
2,Disappointing,This dictionary is relatively hard to follow. The words are listed by Gaelic terms which makes you have to almost go page by page to find the American word. If it was listed the other way around it would make it a lot more useful.
4,Interesting but limited.,A fascinating small work which underscores a key point about Japanese and western aesthetics. But it has distincly wierd undertones and comes across as a reactionary pleading a very localised case. Perhaps someone will pick up the theme in a more general way which reviews the emotional and psychological content of light and shadow. Shame about the bad cover design of the new addition.
3,"Good perspective on Tanizaki, ultimately not very informative about Japan","In Praise of Shadows is a very readable and succinct essay regarding Japanese aesthetics and their gradual Westernization around the turn of the twentieth century. While it provides a good glimpse of what Tanizaki felt about his country, and gives good perspective to better understanding his other works, ultimately its not very informative about Japan. Many of the conclusions about westernization tend to be largley exaggerated. In addition, the picture he paints of Japanese aesthetics is overly romanticisized as well. While it is very readable, and at times interesting, if you read it, use it as a character study of Tanizaki, but if your looking for a good introduction to Japanese aesthetics take this one with several metric tons of salt."
3,Mickey's cage,The bird likes the cage although it is a little flimsy and we had to modify the perches so they would fit in.
3,Wives?? or Daughters of ??,"I watched 1 season of this show MobWives on Amazon Prime cause it was free to watch due to my membership and I was curious who is currently married to mobsters this present day. As I watched I continued to ask myself why they are calling themselves ""wives"". One lady is divorced from a criminal who they say is a mobster, and another lady is married to a guy (another Criminal) who they say is a Mobster? The other 2 ladies are divorced but are daughter's of ""real"" life Mobsters, which is what drew my interest, I don't know where wives come in, (they're pretty much all divorced).. What is the definition of a Mobster? Vs. A common criminal?? They shouldn't have different names, if they are classified the same. I find it hard to watch shows that glorify the worst of someone's existence or past and then use it as their own, and for profit.. I think we need less reality TV and more reality of life, and the greed and the message that is sent to our young ones......"
1,Dumb Dumb Dumb,These ladies need a job or need to focus more on actually raising and nurturing their children. One wife states that she doesn't have time to run around town looking for the things her husband wants her to mail him in prison. She said she is too busy and hardly has time to make herself look good for the day. Really? So you have time to work out and party on the money that your husband made (or stole) but you don't have time for him? Wow. I thought this was going to be a documentary about how hard their lives are being alone. Nope. It's about how hard their lives are now that their husbands aren't able to steal their millions so they can live the high life. Boo hoo.
5,Love the show.,Glad I bought the first season. Really worth the purchase. Now I am all caught up on the series and can enjoy the new seasons.
1,Awful,"This might be the worst reality TV I've ever seen! I don't know exactly what I expected, but so much of the dialogue (if you can call it that) was dubbed, it was pitiful."
1,DVD quality is suspect!!!!,I love the show MobWives but was very disappointed after spending $41.00 on this disc set. I question the disc quality despite being sealed. Are these discs knock-offs??The first 2 discs were scratched upon opening--lost about 10 minutes of video on each disc due to skipping from the scratches!! Terrible quality!! And why does the volume on the discs go up and down? I have never purchased such poorly made DVDs!!Amazon should be responsible but lo and behold--when we log in they have no record of the purchase. Shame on VH1 for selling such crappily made discs through a questionable site like Amazon! So disappointed! It's enough to turn me off of the series altogether.Shame on VH1 and Amazon!!! Do not purchase!!!!!!
5,Mobster b*tching at it best,"I love this season! I'll be watching it over and over and over again! Watching each episode gets me more hooked, & eager to watch the next one! I can't wait till the next season! You will enjoy every episode as each one is different! I love the fights, the bitching the family links & respect!"
1,Poor quality,Ordered twice and both copies the audio and video didn't sync. It was worse than an old Japanese Godzilla movie.
4,Spiritual Prescriptions a la Bingen,Great book for Hildegard fans! She was a millenium ahead of her time and offers relatively timeless insights and Wisdom...
3,Size Matters,"Would fit good if you're a large build person with big arms/wrists.But, nevertheless,this item has that modern style-look.Not that bad at all."
2,Orange face watch,Disappointed that the watch face is encircled in plastic. Gives the watch a cheap look. Hard rubber band is unflexible. Overall not recommended.
5,These sticks are amazing.,"These sticks fit the standards that I've come to know, love, and expect from Pro-Mark. Out of a batch of random sizes and woods that I've decided to try, my previous favorite were Shira-Kashi Oak 727s.These sticks are quite close to them in diameter and length, only being about half a millimeter shorter then the 727s and have the nylon tip which definitely a plus.The big selling points on these over my previous favorites are the thicker neck, bigger tip and the slightly greater weight of hickory.As far as other sticks, these fall about between a 7A and a 5A but are quite a bit longer then both.I'd definitely recommend buying a pair, they're perfect for rock, metal, jazz... just about any genre you wish to play."
4,Feel good movie,Good movie. Jake Gyllenhaal and Chris Cooper do a great job with their roles. Laura Dern is a standout in a small but important role.
5,October sky is a very motivational movie!,I bought October Sky to share with my middle school students. It is a truly inspirational movie that can be enjoyed by the whole family.
5,Amazing!,October Sky is such a great movie! Very heartwarming and being a teacher myself I really love how their teacher inspired them to follow their dreams. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
5,A great movie about American history,As the author ofThe Merry Life of Charles ParkerI drew a lot of inspiration from this film. My son was about seven when this came out on video. My wife had a copy. She thought she might show it to her sixth-graders in the public school. The movie has some profanity in it so she wasn't sure if that would fly with some of the very conservative parents. We discovered this previewing the film. My son was mesmerized. The story of kids building a rocket to keep up with the Soviets is powerfully and eloquently told. I get goosebumps every time we get to that scene late in the film with the last rocket the boys launch. Laura Dern is delightful and Chris Cooper adds considerable depth to the role of a blue-collar father who doesn't understand his son's intellectual ambitions. All of the music from the era is a treat as well. A real gem.
5,Review for October Sky,"October Sky is a movie about a young boy who gets smitten with rockets. There are many great scenes in this movie, but the one I like is O. Winston Link as the engineer of the steam locomotive passing the boys after they pulled up a rail to use to make a better rocket. O. Winston Link had photographed the last of the steam locomotives in action on the Norfolk & Western Rlwy in the Appalachians. It was appropriate for him to be in this scene as, not too long after this, he passed away close to his home in the New York town of Mt. Kisco. Also, the belief the boy's teacher had was also special. Lastly, a lot of the Appalachian scenery is shown in this movie. I really liked this movie."
5,October Sky,"this is the movie of inspiration,when you watch october sky,you live in it. What I like most about October sky is , it's real, real people, real lives.Its what life is all about, go for your dreams.October sky touches your heart, and I recommend this movie with two thumbs up."
4,A Hidden Treasure,This movie didn't exactly get much attention but it sure does deserve it. Great movie.
5,I thought it was a good movie and Homer was really cute.,I thought the movie was excellent and I am interested in rocket science so it was especially appealing to me. I loved it and I also thought Homer was really cute.
5,Exceptional and Inspiring,I read the book before watching the movie and I enjoyed both. Does not rely on special effects but great acting from the cast and intelligently written script. Reminds us what is possible when we set out to reach for our dreams. Good to see that some Hollywood studios have not forgotten how to make a great film. Worth the price of the ticket and a purchase of the DVD.
5,You want sports inspiration...go watch 'Rudy',"This movie is the 'Rudy' equivalent for the academic set. If your kid is not into sports and you want to show him another way to make it in this world, then buy this movie."
5,IT'S WORTH IT'S PRICE!!,"This is my absolute favorite movie of all time. I had to go see it for my birthday because it was the only one we could make. I was really disapointed that we didn't get to see ""My Favorite Martian"" but once the movie started I thought it was real cool. I didn't wat to leave the theater. It is worth it's price in gold. Best Movie of all time!"
4,Good inspirational movie.,"It show this sometimes in my high school science class. The kids seem to like it, and they usually pay attention, but it's not the first movie I'd choose to show (mainly because I teach chemistry and this movie is more appropriate for physics classes).There are some parts in the movie that are ""Hollywood,"" meaning that some of the drama in several scenes seem forced. But I'm a sucker for movies based on true stories, and as those go this is a pretty good one with excellent acting."
5,PERFECT!,I love all of Homer Hickam's books. My interest is always kept while reading because the text is so vivid and compelling. I would recommend ALL of his books to everyone of any age!This movie is perfect and will make you feel like you can accomplish anything if you just try!
5,October Sky is one of the best movies ever made in 1999!,"When this movie first came out I really wanted to see it in the theaters but I didn't get a chance to. But one night I rented it and my parents and I enjoyed every minute of it. I got a little disappointed that it didn't get nominated for an oscar. Oh, well it's still a good movie even though if it didn't get nominated. Laura Dern had an outstanding role and so did Jake Gyllenhaal. I own this movie at home now and I watch it all the time and never get tired of it. It's a good movie to own. I recommened it to all ages."
2,corner of case smashed,"DVD is fine, but the case was in another box inside a bigger box and still the corner of the case was smashed into many small pieces."
5,The top movie of the year.,"Enough saying about the wonderful achievement of this movie. The character development is exceptional which carry a simple story to its triumph and satisfying ending. The music is so mellow that it bring you across the emotional spectrum from saddness and hopelessness (coalwood) to triumphant achievement (space shuttle launch) effortlessly. It demostrated success through self assurance, dedication, hardworking, and most all through proper guidence (Miss Riley). A movie that is deserve to be view by every one. A required reading of the origional book for those inner city kids. An era (and area) that is desperating in need for a positive role model. This movie provide the exact one they need. I wonder why we didn't hear anything from NEA? from black activist? from liberal politician?"
4,"Fun, well-acted Americana","October Sky is an entertaining rendition of Homer Hickam's novel Rocket Boys. It describes Homer's life growing up in a coal mining town in 1950's West Virginia. Although it leaves out some minor characters like Jake Mosby and Geneva Eggers, it gives a pretty good, and fun to watch depiction of an All American story of teenage boys with a rocket building dream. Strong performance by Jake Gyllenhall to lead the cast!"
5,"""October Sky"" or ""Rocket Boys"" it's a great story","""October Sky""October Skyis a great movie based on the true story. It is an example of the American Dream. Our Children can become what they want, if they are willing to work for it. These boys were not ""given"" anything, they earned it, with hard work. This movie is also about the precarious relationships between children and their parents; with love and respect toward each other, even in disagreement. Finally, it's also about friendship. I recommend this move to anyone. I do wish they would have kept the original name, ""Rocket Boys."""
5,Inspirational movie,"This was a wonderful movie. As a teacher, it moved my soul to watch a group of children aspire even without the support of most of the town. It was a real moving movie."
4,October Sky Great Buy,Item was a great buy for the price. Hope to do business with the seller again.
4,Great Movie,"This is a fantastic show with great moral lessons and a good historical context. Again, it's good to have quality movies instead of rated ""R"" tripe."
5,Truly a slice of Americana!,All the 5 stars reviews are correct this movie is a masterpiece and if you have a movie library this one belongs in it no if ands or buts about it. What a GREAT movie you can view this every so often and never get tired of it Chris Cooper was great as the coal miner father. I will always tell it like I see it.Scott M or S&S;.M
1,Like to waste your time? Then you'll love this one.,"I saw this one in the theater after a friend of a friend convinced me to see it with him (he was seeing it for a second time.) After the first ten minutes, I wanted to leave. If you like formulaic and predictable movies that attempt to convince dumb American youth from small, hick towns that they actually have a future beyond their local Wal-Mart or becoming mince-meat in Iraq, then this movie is for you! However, if you like movies that actually challenge you to think, don't waste your time with this one."
1,Not Recommended,"I just barely saw half of this tripe. Why is it tripe? BECAUSE I HAD NO IDEA WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS GOING ON WITH WHAT I SAW! I didn't know who the characters were supposed to be except this kid named Homer, who was only real ambition was to build a rocket and shoot it off at the end of the film. Some plot. I read the book called ""Rocket Boys"" and this movie is just an anagram of the book. I didn't care for the book, so why the movie?"
4,October Sky,Interesting movie. Not only is W. Virginia a pretty coal mining state but responsible for some NASA employees. Cool! I was really impressed with this movie for the price.
3,A suprising knockout,October Sky is based from a true story about a guy who builds a rocket that rockets itself to orbit . This movie had good acting and good sequences but it had some unexcited moments and some confusing story plots but it's a must-see.
4,Good but not great,"I like this movie, but I can't see why everyone is giving it 5 star reviews...it's good but not THAT good. I had heard that it was a good movie but pretty sappy. Now that I've seen it, I agree with that statement. Worth buying but not worth watching every week or something..."
5,"Inspirational, truly well-made film","Everything about this film was exceptional. All four young men gave incredible performances, but especially noteworthy was the talented Jake Gyllenhaal as Homer Hickam. Even though he just about tore my heart out on more than one occasion, the film is not overly sentimental but a very real representation of what one must do in order to achieve one's dreams. Chris Cooper and Natalie Canerday as Homer's parents also did an outstanding job. The production values and period detail were truly excellent. I too cannot recommend this film highly enough. Do yourself a favor and watch it with a young person you care about."
5,Surely deserved better marketing when released.,"Hopefully someone from the studio reads these things because after seeing this film i wonder who the marketing genius was who failed to adequately promote such a wonderful movie. If there ever was a film that today's kids need to see, this is the one. In the year of the return of mindless slasher films this movie shows that a good story can make a great movie. Kudos to all the actors and the director. One movie that should not be missed by anyone, especially those who long for a simpler time in this fast paced, computer driven world."
5,This is one great movie!,"This film brings back memories of ""Stand by Me"". It just had that certain feel to it. This film was filmed in West Virginia, where my grandparents live. Most of the scenery was familiar to me.This was a great story about a boy who fought for his right to live his dream. It was very sentimental, and the scenes between the boy and his father were powerful. You will not be disappointed in this film. You MUST own it!"
5,October Sky,A must watch!!! Love this!!! Fun and inspiration for all!! True story at it's best!!! You can't help but to root for these boys!!!
1,Too Powerful,"I received this as a gift and thought it would be great, but it just isn't practical. There's way too much power. The lowest setting sends ingredients flying everywhere. The lowest setting on this mixer is the same as the highest setting on my old mixer (the setting that you use to get all the goop off the beaters). The scraping spatula also doesn't work well."
1,Avoid if You Need Low Speed,"I've owned a Black and Decker hand mixer (called Spatula Smart when I bought mine) for about 15 years. It's obviously held up and worked ok, but I would never recommend it. There is no low speed. Things fly all over the kitchen when you're beating puddings, liquids or even folding in flour. I even bought a bowl with a fitted cover that the beaters go down inside to try and keep the ingredients from flinging all over. It didn't help much. My beaters are rusting on the tops and bottoms! Rust in my food? I think not. The motor is finally dying from whirring around so fast. While I would say that it's lasted a long time, I'd never, ever recommend it or buy another like it. I should've taken it back right after I bought it."
3,Durable but Too Much Power?,"We purchased this inexpensive mixer to replace one that had a beater go bad. It seems very durable and gets the job done. It comes with two sets of beaters--neither typical of most mixers, but nice to have the ""whisk"" beaters. As a few others have noted, it doesn't seem to have a ""low"" setting... it starts out fast and just keeps getting faster. Ironically, it has a ""speed boost"" button--a ""speed unboost"" button would have been more useful."
1,Black & Decker Pro 250 mixer defective,"We purchaced a Black & Decker Power Pro 250-Watt Mixer last fall locally and when we got it home and used it, we noticed that the slow speed selection was unusually high. We have used it in that condition until now when the mixer will not run unless it is set on the middle setting two up from the slow setting. Even though I had the original box that states it has a 1 year warranty, Black & Decker's customer service refused to help and were not concerned with customer service or their defective product. I have had good luck with Black & Decker products but after this treatment I will no longer purchase anything from Black & Decker."
2,power but no quality,"I was pleased bythe power of this unit. I works in thick batters. However about the 5th usage, the plastic gears stripped. I was not quite finished mixing so this was not a happy moment. Why don't they use metal gears on something that is so important to the longevity of the product. I will go back to a cheaper blender or pay a little more for a real metal drivetrain.black and decker products have always worked pretty well for me. I am disappointed in this product!"
1,Lousy mixer,"We replaced a cheap $10 Proctor Silex mixer with this Black & Decker model that was suppose to be an upgrade. What a mistake this was as the mixer did not even last a year of use. I find it humorous that they give you heavy duty beaters and motor with power boost and then use PLASTIC gears! I took the unit apart as soon as I heard the grinding sounds coming from it and sure enough the gears had warn a thin line down the center of them rendering the mixer worthless. What is amazing to me is the cheap Proctor Silex mixer had worked for 5 years doing the same job without breaking, we ended up donating it at the end but still working as good as new. The only reason we upgraded was to get some of the fancier features this model had, now we need to buy a new mixer."
1,Beaters break and cost $20 to replace,"Have had an earlier version of this mixer for 6 years but probably only used it 10 times. The beaters came apart just like the other reviewer with this NEWER model. If you go to Black and Decker's website you will get redirected twice and wind up at someone called ""Fox"". If you call them you will find replacement beaters cost $20 a pair. I am very saddened by the fact that the original black and decker is now a corrupted shell licensing their name to some cut rate company cranking out junk. How come the greenies yell at us constantly to use paper grocery bags but no one has a problem with filling the landfills up with junk like this thing? Anyway don't bother with it, it is JUNK."
1,No low setting,"I thought this mixer would be perfect because it has 5 settings (who could need more?) BUT, the lowest setting is SO high that it makes the mixer completely useless. Forget creaming butter and sugar together, this machine is so strong that butter pieces go whizzing all over the place. Forget about adding dry ingredients to wet, a cloud forms over the bowl and everyone gets splattered. Even on low the thing is completely unusable. I've never gone higher than the first setting because the first setting is way too strong as it is. I keep using the mixer thinking THIS time it will do what I need but I always end up irritated and dirty. The mixer is now just sitting in my kitchen drawer waiting to be thrown out when I can one that actually has a low setting. I wish I could get my money back but unfortunately I've had it for too long. Trash."
5,Excellent mixer,This mixer is more powerful than my previous Black & Decker so it took a little adjustment. It works very well even in thick cookie batter so it will be usable in more instances. two sets of beaters is nice. Ejection is not easy.
1,Too fast,"The lowest setting for this mixer is insanely fast, basically unusable. If you plan to use this for anything that requires low or medium speed or in a bowl that isn't 4qts, this mixer is not for you."
2,woah!,"Where were all these reviews when I was choosing this item? Like many have said, there is no low speed and the ingredients fly out of the bowl. The only good use I've found is it whipped cream in record time! Definitely wouldn't recommended this item."
1,Sow down,This unit has 5 speeds ranging from fast to extra fast. Even at the slowest speed ingredients fly out of the mixing bowl. This product has a strong motor and would be useful if only it had the ability to operate at slow speed. As is - it is simply unusable for most applications. We will buy something else.
2,Mixer or power drill??,"As other people have said, this thing is RIDICULOUSLY powerful. No low speed at all. I've never even used it above the 2nd setting for fear of launching into outer space. Luckily, I still have my Kitchenaid - got this to do small jobs so it technically does the job intended for my house but I seriously laugh every time I use it because it is so overly powerful.If you need this for a ""do all"" mixer, don't buy it!"
1,Do Not Buy,"In all my years of baking, this is absolutely the worst kitchen tool that's ever been in my collection and will have to be replaced even though it is as good as new. You can make meringue or whip cream on the lowest possible setting but you sure can't cream butter and sugar without having the butter/sugar mix spray all over the kitchen workspace, some of it on you, some of it on the kitchen floor. I have a very strong Do Not Buy warning for this hand mixer.Black & Decker MX250 Power Pro Hand Mixer, White"
1,Sounds like it hates being used!,"I bought this mixer because it had the BLACK and DECKER name and thought it would be great. It is great if you don't mind that it has NO LOW speed, tears everything up in its path and makes the most god-awful noise when being used. I thought I had a banchee in the house! I am having to trash a perfectly good mixer but it doesn't play nice with ingredients and beats the heck out of everything while screaming!"
1,Do not buy this mixer!,"I bought this mixer based solely on other Black & Decker products I purchased in the past. It was supposed to replace my almost 30 yr. old Farberware hand mixer. On #1 the lowest speed, it spattered the ingredients all over the counter. I was finding ingredients in unsuspecting places a week later.I replaced this ""new"" mixer with one recommeded by the editors of Cooks Illustrated, the people who also televise America's Test Kitchen. One of their top recommendations for small appliances was the Cuisinart Power Advantage 7-Speed Hand Mixer. What a difference!! I would highly recommend the Cusinart."
3,Ok for some things,"If you are looking for a mixer to whip cream, forget about this one. It even has a turbo booster that you can use for 2 1/2 minutes, but you can mix and mix and mix and never get whipped cream. Works OK for regular other mixing, cookies, cakes, etc."
2,Almost laughable,"The reviews about this mixer not really having any speed but turbo are 100% accurate. I find myself dreading pulling this hand mixer out of the cabinet, I resort to using the whisk as much as possible because this mixer will fling food all over my kitchen on the lowest speed. I just need to bring myself to replace it. If it weren't for the fact that I don't want to fill the dump with a working piece of home electric I wouldn't even consider giving it to the Good Will."
1,Black & Decker PowerPro,"I like the mixer but the 3rd time I used it, I noticed the metallic covering on the beaters was coming off in my cookie dough. I discarded the dough and am now looking to see if there are plastic beaters available. I don't want to take the chance of contaminating my family with substances that are inedible. I am wondering if anyone else noticed this?I can't use it any more until I can find replacement beaters. It works well but if I can't use it, it's useless. One star because I can't use it at all."
2,Got the wrong model,"Nothing against the mixer so far. But amazon sent the MX250 model in the MX300 box. Everything else was there and in great condition, but the mixer was the wrong one...."
4,Works as said,"I have a Lhasa Apso, he does not like noise of trimmers.But he has no issues with this product.Tolerates it for more than 30 mins.Really Happy...."
1,"Useless, Don't Waste Your Money",I bought this a few weeks ago and tried to use it today on our Bichon Frise mix.Absolutely useless!The DVD shows hair coming off so easily but they don't really work nearly that well. The DVD was made using a different set of clippers as well.Don't waste your money
3,"I loved it, but you might not","I REALLY loved this book, it was the first forgotten realms book I ever read. I was playing the computer game on my commodore 64 and I wanted to read the book that went along with it. I was 10 years old I think, and I had never read a book that I thought was so good. Unfortunately, it is just that, a book for people, particularly younger people, who want a light fast read. The plot is relatively simple so that if you accidentally skip a chapter, you don't miss much. It is a great read if you run a Forgotten Realms AD&D campaign in the moonsea.Bottom line... It's not a work of literary genius, but the plot is entertaining."
5,One of the greats,"This truly was one of the greats. Being a hard core D&D fan, I've read a lot of Forgotten Realms books, but this one really stands out in my mind. The setting was great, and the characters were wonderful. Ren O' the Blade was a very intresting character, a man of great heroism and strong passions. I liked his episode with his thoughts of Tempest. Shal was great. I liked how she wasn't portrayed as the common image for female mages. Tarl was cool. He was a true champion of his church. I mean, so much crap happened to him early on, but he stayed strong. The villan aspect of the book was wonderful, having one villan clearly defined, and one sliding around in the shadows, manipulating others to meet his own ends. The book had a great balance of action, drama, and character development. All and all, it's a must-read for and D&D fan."
3,Not as good as the first time I read it...,"This is one of the very first Forgotten Realms novels I read, so when the Kindle version came out, I jumped at the chance to read it again. Unfortunately, the second time didn't improve the experience. To be fair, this is a pretty old book; and I read it in my teens.The plot is your average ""Heroes needed to clear out this or that location! Treasures to be found!"". The storyline got tiring awful quick -- it became too predictable; not to mention unrealistic. The way the 3 heroes went through each location was too easy. For instance, Shal is an apprentice mage and she manages to defeat monsters more experienced adventurers have fallen to? I mean, come on!You start scratching your head in wondering how it is that experienced adventurers have failed miserably in reclaiming Phlan when these three neophytes succeeded with barely a scratch...Three stars only because it was fun when I read it the first time... otherwise, it's nothing to write home about..."
5,Pool of Radiance,"Book was very well written loved it a lot. Very desciptive, caught my attention right away. You should read this."
5,Amazing,That book is one of the best in the fantasy world. I think it's so good I have 2 copies and read each at least once a month. this book deserves the top ranking 100 stars!! This book is perfect for ANYONE! NO MATTER WHAT THE AGE!!!!
1,Horrid,"Man, this books sucks. I just can't read it any more. I HATE not finishing a book, but this book is just too lame. And it looks like the series doesn't get any better until Ruins of Myth Drannor. Life is too short for something this totally unconvincing. If you want to read a good Forgotten Realms series, I HIGHLY recommend the Finder's Stone Trilogy. Starts with Azure Bonds. Those are fun books."
3,the pen worked!,it was nice that the pen worked and i did not have to go out and buy a whole new leappad but i do wonder how long it will last...it was very easy to replace
2,First time buyer!,"Volume One in this seris was my first eroctic purchase ever and I enjoyed it. This volume, not so much..."
1,Not the Ultimate for sure,"This is just another ole calorie book with the first half devoted to talk about diets exercise and general nutrition. The second half is food items (90%) that I can find the calorie count on the package it came in. It does not have foods I was looking for. . .like, WHOLE GRAINS, 1 oz millet, or buckwheat did not have fresh ground almond butter. . . those are the kinds of things I would say is ULTIMATE as those items are hard to find a calorie amount on. . . .this book spent too much time in the front half on general info and NOT calorie counter and then the section with the counter, it was very hard to follow. . . ."
2,Does she understand what an index is FOR?,"I would not recommend this book. I found this book a real disappointment. I do not wish to spend an hour figuring out what the calories in every meal are. There is a lot of information, but it is spread at random all over the book and the index is almost completely useless. It also recommended calorie intake levels that I believe would be appropriate for a roofer or a dockworker, but for most people with sedentary jobs, she was very far off."
2,not what I had hoped,"I had hoped this book had more specific calorie/carb/fat details rather than the generic food products. It had many purchased items, such as lean cuisine, health choice, etc., but little on non-ready food products. It did not serve my purpose."
4,Calorie counter,This book is a lot of help . It has the list of Restaraunts and fast food places to make a good decision on eating.
1,The Ultimate Calorie Counter,"I will never buy another anything without reading the reviews. This book is useless as a ""handy reference"" for managing a diet. There is no rhyme or reason to the organization, and, to echo other reviews, who needs calorie counts on prepared foods that have calories on the boxes???? Sheesh, what a waste of money. I'm not proud to say I'm putting it in the goodwill donation bag (it should, in fact, go in the trash... at least at Good Will, someone can look at it before they buy it).(Amazon made me ""rate it""... the one star is not accurate... no stars is correct."
1,"Boring, poorly written, unimaginative, typical self-centered Roth","Don't waste your money unless you are an insomniac.Even though I find Roth's writing and subject matter to be generally of little interest I bought this book with high hopes after seeing all the great reviews. After all, the subject of altered history is usually intriguing - who wouldn't wonder what the world would be like if the U.S. had stayed out of WWII?Sadly this book is simply a re-hash of the author's rather dull formative years in urban New Jersey, with rather predictable dialogue and plot devices. The usual sort of whiney angst you find in Roth novels, with a focus on lower midde class Jewish family life. Even as a member of the tribe I found the presentation to be cliched and booorrrring.If you like Roth's prior works, by all means buy this one. But if you are looking for a fascinating page turner, spend your $$ on a real novel like In Cold Blood."
2,Where is the ending?,"Deceptively highly rated book. Having read my fair share of AH books, thought is was about time I picked this one up to take for a spin. It started off quite well slowly building up to the ""it can't happen here"" moment. Just as the suspense begins to build, the book ends with such a poor ending that it ruins all the time and effort the reader put into it. In lay mans terms, the book is like sex w/o the climax that ends abruptly. Kind of pointless and off-putting. This is not really AH but growing up Jewish in New Jersey with a dabbing of AH. The ending pretty much reveals the true nature of the thoughtless nature of the book. As a nitpick, how does the German invasion of Russia end in the same nature even though there is no lend lease to Russia? I mean in an AH book, one expects the author to have some fundamental knowledge of history."
2,Not Roth's Best,"My comments here are related only to style and not content. It seems that Roth could have used a better editor. It's almost as if he wrote the book in a rush, adding a character when he thought of him/her without bothering with a seamless sense of inevitable plot. The other irritating thing was his habit of explaining and explaining. Granted, some people may not know a lot about the history of the period and the people who made it, but after awhile it seems long winded and even pedantic. I am one of those people who thinks Roth is one of our greatest living authors; however, this is not his best book."
2,Real Dissapointing,"Interesting premise, but fell short and was a little too far fetched. I also found it too preachy and filled with author's obvious beliefs, which after a while get to be too much. Thw writing was fine, but I just did not like it that much depsite reading it faily quickly."
1,Dull read,"I am usually a big fan of historical fiction, but I found this book boring. It was a chore to get through and was dull from beginning to end. I wouldn't recommend anyone read this unless they needed a sleep aid."
2,The author truly did his research.,"Book was okay, but slow and times and ended abruptly. Had good historical background but did not make me feel like I was really there like other historical fiction has. Outline at end of book stated what was fact and what was made up, this was very useful and interesting. The author truly did his research."
2,"A nice read, nothing spectacular","Roth has been an excellent writer throughout, standing aloof from most American hypes. With this novel he fails quite miserably. He uses a what-if plotline to try and fan some flames in the worries about the US reaction to 9/11. It is a nice read, especially in his personal observations on what anti-Semitism could have led to in the late thirties. Still towards the end things are stretched a little far, leaving me as a reader in doubt whether the book really justifies making so much hypothetical fuss about something that took an entirely different course already so many years ago. The very few observations that translate to today's situation in the US hardly stand. Making the book a fluke in Philip Roths' usual literary standard."
4,Interesting alternative,"I have never read any of Phillip Roth's other works, but I saw this one on the rack and I picked it up on a whim. I have always been a big fan of alternate history and WW II, so I figured that this would be right up my alley. I was right. Roth has a great descriptive voice, and you really get a feel for his 1940's era Newark. You also feel for the paranoia that grips the American Jewish community when Lindberg becomes president. I always enjoy a novel that immerses you in the lives of its protagonists, and I really got a feel for the dynamics of the Roth family during this difficult time. While this book doesn't have the sweeping scope or adventure undertones of most alternative history, it is still a worthwhile read for anyone who enjoys that era and the might-have-beens."
2,A let down,"I was very excited about reading this book, it has a great premise, but the plot simply didn't deliver. Slow, and difficult to get into."
5,"Also Read ""I Married A Communist""","Philip Roth has a gift of writing alternative histories that are hard to distinguish from ""reality."" There are times in reading this book that I almost ask myself ""Am I sure FDR was re-elected in 1940?"" In both ""I Married A Communist"" and this book, Roth tells a true story, even if it is fiction.I cannot say enough good things about this book.""Sophie's Choice"" comes to mind as a companion piece. Nobody is in the same company as Styron, but Roth is at least in the same neighborhood.Thank you, Philip Roth."
3,Good read gets better at the end,At first I was annoyed -- too much schettle talk -- everyone is out to get the Jews etc. I stuck with it and found that I rather liked the ending and it explained some of the earlier happenings. The idea of what if ... is a good device but again a little too much angst of people are out to get you ...
4,An excellent book,"There are a lot of reviews on here that make me stop for a minute and ask myself, ""what the heck did they read?"" The idea that it's anti-Christian and that most Americans are a step away from goosestepping are not even remotely close to anything in the book. The real (and terrifying) political message of the book is how fragile democracy is. I only give five stars to a book that blows my socks off and changes my life forever though but I highly recommend it."
3,Alternative history only works if the premise is believable,"I am actually a fan of Phillip Roth's work, so I was saddened to find this one so unbelievable...and yet, the writing is, at times, so vivid and compelling, that I couldn't give it less than 3 stars.But the book is deeply flawed, mainly because Roth seems to be trying to create parallels to German and American anti-semitism and its expression. In doing so, he stretches credulity, finally to the breaking point.The United States had (and still has) its share of racial and religious prejudices but to equate Lindbergh and Hitler was a stretch I just couldn't make. Tis time around, I felt Roth missed the mark, but I applaud his effort."
4,"A Well-Written, Interesting Tale Of Alternative History!","Philip Roth has long been one of our leading literary authors and, while The Plot Against America may not be his best work, it is certainly, very well-written, thought-provoking and holds your interest from beginning to end. The basic plot involves a Jewish family's concerns about life in America if, and subsequently when, Charles Lindbergh, is elected president. Roth's character development and narrative skills makes you feel that you are right there living with this family and sharing the fears and turmoil that they are experiencing. The Plot Against America is well worth reading from a literary standpoint as well as from an alternative history perspective. The only factor that keeps me from giving this book a 5-star rating is the ending, which, while satisfacory, I felt was a bit rushed and a bit abrupt."
1,Just as poor as last book I read by this author many years ago,Good plot but not developed by concentration of Jewish Faith.I will not be reading anything else by this author ever.
3,A Serious but Unconvincing Imagining,"The Plot Against America is a serious book. The historical background for the novel is carefully researched. The alternative history appears to emerge seemlessly out of reality. And the characters in the book are real human beings.In my opinion, however, the events, as they unfold, do not ring true. The alternative history lacks the texture and feel of reality - everything is too pat. And the great trouble the author takes to alternate the chief protagonists personal crises with historical events sometimes seems forced.In sum I found this an interesting but ultimately unconvincing effort."
2,I didn't get into it from start to finish,"I kept thinking I was going to ""get"" it, but I never did. I listened to the book on unabridged CD and I thought at one point I got the CDs mixed up because he reveals the whole scoop and then goes back and fills in the gaps. The characters were interesting, but I did not find the story in general interesting... Maybe I just don't get the genre of alternate history."
3,Mixed bag,"While I enjoyed the book overall, I did find it a bit plodding at times. The author is nothing if not extremely creative in coming up with the plot about FDR getting defeated by a Lindbergh with clear anti-semitic tendencies, and a resulting pro Nazi tilt. The book is an interesting combination of ""big picture"" political stuff and a more intimate portrayal of what one family was going through.The plot twists at the end struck me as a bit of a stretch. Why do authors occasionally just go crazy at the end of the book ?Firm 3 star experience."
2,Hard to Pick Up,"A good novel should be hard to put down, but this was almost the opposite. It took me much longer to finish this one than most, because reading it could be such a chore. I've never read any other works by Roth, so I wasn't familiar with his style, but he certainly does enjoy his run-on sentences (peppered with long-winded parenthetical asides)--some go on for over a page! Very distracting. Additionally, Roth can be way too over-the-top with his lists, whether it is a listing of 22 characters in the neighborhood, or 48 guests at a dinner party, they can be exhausting.Perhaps it has been too long since I've read classic literature, but between the subject matter and all the great reviews for this book, I thought it would be a real page-turner. It is anything but."
4,Audiobook review,"Most of the other reviewers discuss the book in detail, so this will be about the unabridged CD. This was the longest book I've listened to, 11 discs, and the first work of fiction. Ron Silver did an excellent job as reader. His acting skills were used effectively to very subtley change the pitch/tone for each of the main characters voices. Definetly made my long commute bearable and I found myself staying in the car to finish a chapter even after I arrived at home/work. I borrowed this from my local library, so don't know if I would have been as pleased if I had spent $30-$45."
4,Execution doesn't quite live up to intriguing premise,"After reading the rave reviews I was prepared for something special...perhaps a bit overprepared.The premise of the novel is brilliant and especially relevant to today's politics. ""It can't happen here."" Yeah, right...I also enjoyed reading from the perspective of young Phillip Roth. It was mostly a good way to see the action unfold. The drama of a working class Jewish family in Newark and their reaction to political changes in the US seemed like a reasonable approach that played to Roth's strengths.But the ending is almost ridiculously anticlimactic. Although there is a nice twist about Lindburgh and the Nazis, there seems to be a bit of an overly quick wrap-up going on. Also, the narrative flows less than smoothly at times. Most of the problem occurs when Roth skips ahead and tells the conclusion before giving the details.Overall, ""Plot..."" is a good book but probably not quite worthy of the hype."
5,Roth at his finest,"In this magnificant imagined history, Roth only needs to tweak actual events just slightly to whip them up into imagined horrors. The anti-Semitism of 1930s/1940s Europe and America were close in spirit, close enough that Roth logically turns America into a fascist and fearful state of of disunity. Showing us this alternate history from an adult looking through his childhood gives it a personal feeling that makes it all the more believeable.While parallels between this book's imagined administration and the current American political situation are frighteningly obvious, Roth wisely lets the comparisons build in the reader's mind.A great book from one of America's most inspired talents."
5,A different America,This is an interesting book. It makes one stop and think what the United States may have been like during WWII. I like history and like thinking outside the box and this book does that. It allows you to think outside the box. It allows us to see the war from another perspective. It's a must for anyone that has liking of history and any twist to history.
4,Roth's PLOT AGAINST AMERICA Timely,Philip Roth delivers again. A timely reminder of how fine a line separates us from facism.
2,A disappointment!,"Roth's latest book is based on a clever and interesting idea. However several things contribute to my disappointment with this novel. Philip Roth intrudes into the novel by being the principal character...Philip as a small boy growing up in Newark and his family ...and this device adds nothing and includes a lot of information which is, frankly, boring!Secondly, the plot is totally unbelievable..not because Fascism couldn't happen here, but because the plot line and writing aresimply not convincing."
1,A major disappointment,"This is the first work by this autor I've read and it will likely be the last. Counterfactual history works have grown from ""rare and difficult to find"" to ""can't take two steps without falling over one"". All things considered, I don't see how this book could begin with such an outstandingly interesting premise to such a miserably uninteresting ending.I'm guessing there was a point to the authors story, but what it was escaped me entirely. Perhaps it was buried in one of his endless paragraph sized sentances or his ""page of type"" sized paragraphs. And, mind you, I was trying to enjoy this book!After fastening upon an entirely believeable historical possibility he smothered it with a cast of utterly unbelieveable minor actors who never once behaived realistically.A good story, an interesting idea was lost in four hundred pages of meandering sillyness."
1,Portnoy's Complaint meets Lord of the Rings,"Easily the worst written novel I've ever made myself read. Somehow Roth has the idea that people enjoy his free associations. His narcissism is legendary (see the famous review of Portnoy by the late, great Bruno Bettelheim).The what-if scenario is intriguing: what would happen if a real, overt anti-semite gets into the White House? Would people respond with all the presumed latent atavistic anti-semitism that Roth imagines? Maybe. But is it worth plowing through endless asides, nearly page-long sentences with numerous asides to get the message?No, it is not.The idea is good. The execution is awful. If he had an editor, that editor should be fired. If he didn't he ought to get one. Jeeeez...how many times is he going to write Portnoy???? Once was enough, already. Do something else, Roth."
3,Philip Roth Book purchased at Amazon,This book is not up to Roth's talent as a writer. It was a lazily written demonstrating no original thought or insight. I can't say that no readers would like this book if they don't demand much in original thinking.
3,Not What I Was Expecting...,"This book honestly felt like a chore to get through. Roth's writing style is comparable to a WWII veteran's story-telling: lots of babbling with irrelevant information and a more than a handful of run-on sentences. Painful to get through but I feel satisfied that I did finish the novel. The postscript and historical events mentioned throughout the novel were interesting and Roth's imagination knows no bounds. Clever story, but too littered with information that takes away from important plot and character development. Not sure if I recommend this, even to history/politics buffs like myself."
4,Plot Against America - good story,I liked the hypothetical plot and the insights about the risks to freedom when the citizenry gets carried away with a personality.
3,'a nightmarish vision of America's anti-Semitic fury roaring...up our backstairs like the waters of a flood',"Roth tweaks 1940s history, imagining how his native USA might have been if Roosevelt had lost the presidential election to Lindbergh- the aviator who was also anti-Semitic and isolationist (opposed to involving his country in Europe's war).He brings out the human side to what could just be a political tale by narrating it as his 9-year-old self; watching his family affected by events such as a state initiative to deport Jews. His cousin determines to help in the War but has to go to Canada to join up. Other families settle in Canada, feeling safer there, while some Jews go along with Lindbergh's government from self-seeking motives.Not really my sort of book- I thought Roth evoked his childhood brilliantly but couldn't get too interested in political events and was glad to finish it."
4,Highly detailed and fictional account of WWII.,"Recommended in '1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die'. An excellent examination of how and why bigotry and racism on a mass scale can occur, re Nazi Germany. Here it is brought closer to home when history is re-written in such a way that the USA president refuses to allow America to enter the war and encourages blame on the Jewish population for wanting to get involved in the first place. Highly detailed and researched and made to seem very real. Written in such a way that you can easily believe it is a true autobiographical account from someone who survived this era - in some places the text is almost boring and mundane, just like it would probably have been (at times) in Nazi Germany. Thus the growing tide of evil and change sits alongside the day-to-day trivia of normal life. Any history buff will likely love this. I found it fascinating."
3,Great Expectations Dashed,"What a captivating plot! What a joy, only to culminate in abject disappointment.Never have I read a novel with such increasing interest only to have the excitement dashed by a wimpy, unbelievable ending. It's as if the writer were in a hurry to finish the novel, so he makes up some unbelievable denouement and implies to the reader that all the irresistible sociological forces in the first 80% of the book were simply much less compelling than they seemed."
2,Character character character,"This is the third book I have read by this author. After giving up on the first book I tried, Sabbath's Theater, I decided that I would give The Human Stain a try, and that I did finish but it took some dedication. Well, this book faired a bit better. I think his writing style in this book was less heady and more grounded in what is real or what could be real if historical events transpired differently. However, I found that the novel was, at points, too character driven as opposed to the events surrounding the title's suggested premise. While I can say that this book was good, I cannot say that I would recommend it for someone expecting a historically event based novel. I think I am done with Mr. Roth at this point in my life as I know there are other more engaging books to read. Maybe it is because I am not Jewish and did not grow up during WWII, or maybe it is just his writing style. I can't bash this book but I also cannot praise it."
4,Eighty percent good,"I thouroughly enjoyed the first eighty percent of Roth's new, entertaining and often humourous novel. Roth paints a very detailed portrait of Jewish suburban life in the 1940's and how political events can shape and mould those lives. The rise of Lindbergh and the suburban family chronicle are briliantly interwoven. Then... (not to give away the ending) it just seems like Roth grew tired of writing the book and ended it too abruptly. Gone are the family insights and interweaving of national events and family life. Perhaps Roth couldn't figure out how to end the book, but this reader feels cheated of a meaningful end to a wonderfully told tale."
2,Interesting concept but boring book,"The concept behind this book is fascinating. The book would be interesting if it were half as long and followed the story of the main characters. Roth spends whole pages running down lists of people who attended various functions, establishing characters who do not contribute to the plot, and otherwise digressing onto every tangent imaginable.It would be far more efficient to just read a few of the reviews here on Amazon. You'll get the gist of it."
1,A paranoid's fantasy.,"Roth's novel claims if Lindbergh had run for president against the popular FDR in 1940 he would have won in a landslide. Americans would embrace isolationism and fascism. Critics had predicted this premise would generate controversy however reader reviews seem to imply it is plausible. What Americans are we talking about...the generation which defeated fascism in Europe? And a shy, reclusive Lindbergh as president? Perhaps Howard Hughes would have been vice president. It is true that FDR was characterized by the 1940 republican nominee as a warmonger. FDR went on to claim 55% of the popular vote and 449 of 531 electoral votes, defeating the republican, communist and socialist presidential candidates (no, there was no German Bund candidate). As an alternative history Roth's work strains credulity."
1,Ready For A Room At Bellevue,"WOW! Over the years Roth has dropped little hints of his extreme hatred of non-Jews but now he lets it all hang out. In Roth's world there are only two kinds of people: Good(Jews), Bad(anti-Semites).Roth has shown himself to be nothing more than the mirror image of the late William Pierce, founder of the neo-Nazi group National Alliance. Where Pierce railed against Jews and non-whites, Roth spews-off against ""rednecks"" and Catholics. What's really sad is that the cognoscenti hold Roth in high esteem as a champion of American letters.Roth needs to stick to writing quasi-porn, which is what he does best.Save your money folks."
2,DETAILS,"When I first read that this book was coming out, with this plot, I thought I would LOVE it. After the first chapter I began to skim the book till I finished. I do not need, no one alive needs, every detail about every thing that is discussed. Page after page after page aboutone stamp....it got to be almost sickening after a few times. This is an alternate history novel, not a book on stamps, and that is what I felt I was reading for at least the first few chapters."
1,bloviating bigot,"this book is a patently absurd fantasy.it is deeply offensive and insulting to non-jewish americans.the idea that the usa could have gotten in bed with hitler is utterly cretinous!were supposed to hatelindbergh cause he didnt want to get involved in the war-duh!-most americans didnt want war;fdr only got reelected by falsely promising we wouldnt be in the war!yet this tired,old,overrated jewish bigot sees america as a raving lunatic that wants to conqueor the world??so lucky lindy got some medal from adolf(pre-war)how many thousands of ""americans"",many jewish,were supporters of stalin,even after the war!!!!"
2,Too Much,"Roth is not the most subtle of writers, and while I understand this I believe that what ""happens"" in and with this novel, while ""plausible"" (etc.), is simply ""too much"": it's strident, overemphatic, besotted with its own cleaverness and sense of truth, justice and the essential beauty of ""American Way"" and restored American destiny. It is also, in some respects, obscuritanist. For example: somewhere in the endnotes it mentions the fall of Japan and the end of WW2, but it does not mention the little matter of the atomic bomb: a dirty trick by the Americans and not beyond the scope of the novel (but that would ruin the novel's pristine sense of the ""justness"" of the narrative of American history)."
4,Not your typical Roth,"I bought this book because I've enjoyed Roth's previous books. To my surprise, I found it to be very un-Roth like but still as intriguing as anything else he's written. With a science fictional ""alternate world"" theme, Roth's chilling tale suggests that anti-Semitism is always lurking just below the surface of our ""civilzed"" culture, and how with a few plausible twists in history, Jews could have been relegated to second-class citizens, blamed unfairly for the world's woes. A warning for the future as well as a fascinating tale of what might have been, The Plot Against America is perhaps the most serious of Roth's books and the one that will give you the most to think about when you've finished the book. Recommended."
2,Lindbergh disappeared and everything went back to normal?,"A pleasant read but disappointing ending. The book did open my mind to the fears that the Jewish minority would reasonably have (really, any minority) with a slight shift in electoral politics, but the ending was completely unreal. By the way, the Constitution provides for presidential elections only every 4 years so there is no way that FDR or anyone else would have been elected president in November 1942."
3,Plodding Read,"I thought the theme of this novel would make for an exciting read. In fact, I barely could finish the book. It was fairly strong about life with a seemingly typical working class Jewish family with Democrat Party ideology in Newark. I would assess the overall story as an average read. In my view, definitely not a quick page turner."
3,OK,"I generally liked the book. The plot was pretty good although the idea of Lindbergh as a fascist was a bit of a stretch. The problem came at the end. It seemed like Mr. Roth got tired of writing and just stopped. The disappearance and its possible explanations made little sense. However the biggest complaint I have is the return of FDR and the entire timeline reconnecting with the actual timeline as if the events of the preceding two years had not happened. Once history is changed the events that follow must change as well. Therefore there should have been no Guadalcanal, Battle of the Bulge, or RFK assassination."
2,He Should Have Retired After Portnoy's Complaint,"Lemme see what Roth has wrought: Charles Lindburgh becomes president, aligns the USA with Nazi Germany, begins co-opting Jewish youth and cowing the rest of the country's Jews, uses the ""Fly Over"" States' population as Storm Troopers to further discourage dissent and we go to the brink of an American Holocaust. Roth doesn't seem to recall that Lindburgh never praised the Nazi regime's racial policies; he did believe that war with Germany was not wise in 1939 and 1940 because we were not close to being ready and that Japan was a much clearer danger. After Pearl Harbor, Lindburgh served on combat duty as a civilian ""advisor"" to US Army Air Corps and Navy/Marine Corps units in the South Pacific at the ""advanced age"" of 42 when much younger celebrities did bond drives and USO shows. Save your money for better than this collection of tripe attacking a great American."
3,Not a thriller,I mistakenly purchased this thinking it was a grand scope thriller in the vein of Ludlum.It's not. Imagine Anne Frank in Newark.
5,very compelling read,"I really liked this book. It was taut, realistic and well paced. Roth does an excellent job of ""what if"" and that's not always easy to do. Definitely a must read for WWII buffs, conspiracy theorists and people who enjoy historical ficition."
4,It Could Have Happened!,"This book gives you a scary ""what if"". Charles Lindbergh hadbecome a national hero after he flew over the ocean in an airplane called the ""Spirit of St. Louis"".In real life he was anit-semite and pro nazi.In this book he defeats Franklin D.Roosevelt in the Presidential election of 1940.This spreads panic in the Jewish households of America.He begins enacting proNazi policies.He also negotiates a ""cordial understanding"" withAdolph Hitler to stay out of World War II.Lindbergh also beginsimplementing anti-Jewish pogroms.This is definitely an eye opener of a book.You actually see what could have been."
2,Interesting idea overwritten and drawn out,"The idea is a very interesting one and presents a very compelling what if. However, the writing style appears to try too hard. The book is well over 350 pages but would be a much better read closer to 200 if much of the nonsense was cut out. The author chooses to use 15 long, runon sentences to explain what many others do in one. There are many rants and meaningless side stories which add to the over abundance of wastes words used. This makes it a more difficult and labor some read when it doesn't need to be. When one is able to sift through the pages long thoughts and cut it down to the nub, one does have an enjoyable story at hand. That is if you have the patience."
2,a little bit overrated,"I would have liked to have given 2.5 stars, but that option not available. Maybe it is just me, but this book could at times be very difficult to read. I personally don't think it is good writing when several thoughts are included in a sentence that sometimes runs the whole page! Many times while reading this book, of which i am admittedly only half through, I would say to myself, ""what the hell did I just read?"" and have to go back.The only other time I remember of late reading a book that frustrated me like this was A Man In Full, by Tom Wolfe. My dad loved it and so did many others, but I found it to be extremely annoying the way he forms his thoughts on paper.Maybe this is just not my kind of book....."
2,A Challenge to stay awake.,"Frankly, I found this book to be completely boring. The premise was very interesting. I don't think Mr. Roth followed through and gave us what we expected, a truely cruel and despotic American Goverment ran by Nazis. I also find that the plausibility and reasoning behind the plot was lacking. I truthfully believe Roth wrote this book under time constraints, because the development of plot ideas shows it (or he simply lacks imagination). My recommendation is not to waste your time with this book."
2,strange plot curve,"The first half of the book was pretty boring; I kept waiting for the poo to hit the fan. The third quarter of the book was somewhat compelling, with the horror slowly but surely building in a somewhat believable way. Then things got woo-woo crazy for a few dozen pages. Then back to complete sanity.It just isn't a well-thought out plot curve. If it weren't for the fact that this is the only book I brought with me this weekend on a trip I probably would have stopped reading it."
3,roth is loosing steam,in the beginning a policital thriller worth reading but after 3/4 falling almost off the cliff as if Roth got bored with the topic or had to cut the book short.
3,"Hmm, maybe I missed the point?","The novel is very well-written, the alternative history was well-conceived, and the family dynamics ring true. Problem is, I was left wondering what the point to it all was. I find it quite remarkable that Roth includes himself (not to mention, the rest of his family) as a character in the story. But in the end, since all of this is ""alternate"" history and didn't really happen (sort of fundamentally undermining the book), I was left feeling rather dissatisfied. In something that purports to be history (even if feigned history), I expected some conclusion.Sure, one can say, ""Ah, but look what *might* have happened if this or that other thing had happened ..."", to which I would reply, ""Um, yeah, but it didn't."" Then, you say, ""But it *could* have ..."", to which I would again reply, ""Sure, but it didn't."" It just left me shrugging.As I said in the title to my review, maybe I missed the point, but this novel didn't really do much for me. Caveat emptor."
2,Disappointing.,"If I were looking for a book with the longest, most confusing sentences, this would be it. As an alternate history, it sucks."
1,there wasn't a plot against America in this novel,"if this were written as a creative writing project it would get an F. As alternative history it isn't any better.The plot of the title was mostly a conflict between 2 political parties. He did invent a plot against Jews that wasn't very believable. There certainly was no plot against America in general.Since the book is partly based on Roth's childhood, he should have just written an autobiography. He could have added his fears of antisemitism."
1,plot against America,"I found Roth's book, The Plot Against America, to be a look into a demented mind. A mind full of a repulsive, odious, schizophienic logic.It is jammed with attacks on Catholics, and Christian people. Wander Roth start wandering.Is not worth your time to read, I am glad I bought it second hand in paperback...would of been mad as hell if I paid full amount for this trash."
1,Tedious storyline,"It couldn't hold my attention. Growing up as a Jew in an America that still more or less tolerated a casual sort of anti-semitism, Roth always felt different. Yes, got it. Lindbergh and Ford were anti-semites who admired Adolf Hitler. Yeah, I know. History would have been different if America had elected Lindbergh president in 1940. Yep, sure would have.After about two-thirds the way through, I tossed this book aside. I have too many other books to read to waste time on this."
4,Plausible Scenario,"Wanted to read the book for sometime but never got around to it. It is a dark book, no real hero (except if you think the author is)plausible scenario, Lindberg becomes president, sides with Nazi Germany, things become terrible for jewish familes in America. I will not give away the reason Lindberg sided with Germany, read it and find out. Good book to read. Not for the masses."
2,Not Nearly as Fun as it Sounded,"I was hoping for an interesting alternate history story, and what I got was a run-of-the-mill story about growing up as a Jewish boy. The whole Lindbergh-Nazi plot was just background."
2,Roth should retire,"Most characters were very boring.Characters introduced, not developed,then dropped. Like the narrator's friend who moved never to be seen again. As I recall people generally kept in touch with letters in those days even children.Are we to believe that after years of abject isolutionism somehow the U.S. enters WWII quickly at the end of the book and the war ends right on schedule in 1945. It's as if Roth got really sick of working on this project and said to himself ""that's good enough, people will buy it."""
2,"The plot against America, part 2","I love the implication that Republicans are nazi. I can't wait for ""The Plot Against America, part 2"" This is the one where FDR wins the election and vulnerable Individuals or as Stalin called them, ""useful idiots"" start to drag our country slowly toward Marxism. Oh wait, this is really happening."
2,Like being stabbed in the eye with a spoon...,"I received this for Christmas, and am still only halfway through it. This after reading 20 novels the year prior. I don't really like to speak ill of such an accomplished writer, but this just bored me to death. None of the characters are even remotely interesting. The plot forced me to buy it, but the execution of said plot is forcing me to an early grave, hyperbole and all."
1,"The Worst American Novel Since Philip Dru, Administrator","A quirky colleague of mine who knew intimately all the top spokesmen for virulent White racism and Anti-Semitism in America once told me that Klandestine Republican David Duke's favorite novel was Philip Roth's Portnoy's Complaint. Go figure. But even the hooded Duke would puke over his white sheet perusing Roth's latest preposterous hate-filled nonsense. It is one massive ahistorical cliche after another, the worst novel since Edward Mandell House's Philip Dru, Administrator. Like House, Roth should have remained anonymous."
1,Offensive,"If I could rate this book less than one star, I would. This ""book"" was heavily biased & just a vehicle for the writer's private agendas, which weren't elequently presented. I just can't believe that the writer is considered one of the best in current day. I wouldn't use this trash to wrap yesterday's garbage.At least I didn't have to buy the book; that would have offended me more."
3,good story -- poorly written,"Roth has concocted a grand storyline and those of us who are his contemporaries, and especially those of us with roots in New Jersey, will find much that brings back the feelings we, as kids, had during the 30's and 40's. But. And it's a big ""But"" -- it is so poorly written that I found myself going over sentences that seemed to make no sense, skipping endless plot mechanics tht slowed down the story rather than moved it forward. I even called a friend to see what she thought of the ending, an ending that was a flat finish to a story with huge gaps that might have wrapped things up. It's as if Roth decided he had a plot idea, began its intricacies and then ran out of ideas or became so mired in convolutions that he couldn't think of a proper ending.He's an author who seems to be popular by reputation and a few excellent books. This isn't one of them."
3,A Good Short Story,"As strange as it seems, the novel ""The Plot Against America"" would have been more successful as a short story. The concept - America ruled by a fascist-leaning, anti-semitic President - is wonderful. Wonderful because it is so plausible, hauntinlgy plausible. Yet, the execution of this concept is lacking. The characters are not effectively brought to life; there are unnecessary pages of seemingly unimportant names; and, finally, and most significantly, the conclusion is so unsastifactory. This novel, with its portentous opening sentence, begins with a bang and truly concludes with a whimper. It is like the month of March, but lacks the substance, the color, the magic of this most versatile thirty-one days."
2,Waste of Time,"I wanted to like this book. Alternative history stories are usually fascinating. However, this book is largely page-after-page a jewish family drama. That is fine, but I found it very boring. The ""President Lindbergh"" idea is not the focus. In fact, the book is slow and plodding until the last 50 pages. In these final pages, the most dramatic political intrigue occurs. Yet, there are not enough pages left to fully explore these plot turns, let alone convince the reader they are plausible. The ending of this book felt like an incomplete Cliffs Notes version of another novel. There were no shortage of positive blurbs on the back cover of my paperback, yet this book left me wondering what those critics were thinking when they praised this book."
3,Not What I Expected,"I guess I was expecting this book to read more like a political thriller. In fact it was really a story that follows one Jewish families trials and tribulations through an imagined alternate history. What if Charles Lindbergh had become president instead of FDR in 1940. That premise intrigued me, and I imagined a fast paced thriller to ensue. What I got was a slow paced story seen through the eyes of the family. It wasn't a page turner but it kept up my interest enough to finish it. Parts of the plot seemed a little far fetched and I believe the ending was a cop out. Give it a try, it does make you want to dust off your history books."
4,Fascinating Look at What Might Have Been,"When I heard that Philip Roth was writing again I got excited, but when I heard his subject I was fascinated. I've been a fan of this time period for many years and loved the notion that so many alternatives presented in such a short period.Lindbergh was worshipped - see Scott Berg's wonderful biography for evidence. It is very plausible that his appeal to the huge number of American isolationists could propel him into office.I suppose that Roth's proposition that this would lead to American pogroms is intentionally provocative, but it had one unintended comfort: it's one of the first things I've ever read that made me feel better about McCartyism.A good read - as always, Roth writes in an energetic, engaged way."
2,A big let down.,"I was very disappointed by this novel. Roth is a talented writer, and I had hoped that he would be able to create a truly compelling novel out of such a promising idea. However, the novel just didn't work for me. The characters felt something like cardboard cut outs and seemed inconsistent in their behavior. The plot spun out of control and became completely fantastic and quite unbelievable. Read something else by Roth - I think you'll enjoy one of his earlier works more than this."
2,in the shadow of bush,"Roth doesn''t seem to understand the Constitution. I think this is an okay novel, but it is written in the shadow of the 2000 election and 9/11 and I think Roth sees a little bit of Bush in his Charles Lindbergh.The kid's perspective was okay but I needed a little more history. And then the ending just messed everything up. I think he was getting tired of writing. If you want to read a good Roth novel go with ""portnoy's complaint."" If you want good alternative history fiction go elsewhere."
5,Excellent book!,"I think this is a wonderful book! It brought up so many feelings, with humor and sadness, through the family dynamics as they tried to weather the changes in America. It also expressed the fear I feel for America today, as I watch the far right ""kidnap"" my country and try to use the Constitution and the Bill of Rights for their own narrow beliefs. I guess some, whose politics are totally opposite mine, may not find the book so readable, but it is a great read, worth every minute I spent on it."
2,Not what it says on the back,"I completed this book that I so willingly dropped in the hat at the last minute for our book club. I was all excited to lead the group in discussion and get ahead. I love history and this book really caught my attention.Unfortunately, this book was a struggle to get through and is not that satisfying. The only reason I finished it was my not-very-exciting train ride from Milwaukee to Minneapolis (I had nothing else to do). I also was praying it would get better (it never did!)The writing is terrible. As other reviewers have written, it is full of run-on sentences with tons of commas and dashes. The chapters are long and hard to follow... I found myself having to reread the pages multiple times to figure out what was going on. I cared nothing about any of the characters. The story line is not very interesting... I would not waste your time with this book."
3,"This is just a taste, not the meal.","Roth fails to credibly develop the plot and does not expound on the key issues. We needed more on world politics. America's relations with Britain, more on the military implications, the likely dialogue among the key historic figures etc. All in all, this reads like an interesting appetizer, but Roth should have dealt with fundamental questions in a world war with America assuming a neutral to pro German tilt. There are the usual enjoyable humerous morsels, but no depth. Roth does manage to create an air of effective anxiety and discomfort which gets to the reader. I kept thinking what this novel could have been and should have been, but was not."
2,Does Not Live Up to its Reputation,"I thought this book would be more interesting than it was. Admittedly, I bought it thinking it would be more of a political thriller than a character study, and I really wanted to put it down after about 50 pages. I stuck with it, though, and after a while, I began to enjoy the passages devoted to young Philip's story--namely, the story of what overwhelming events and parental fears can do to a child. That part of the book was well done and captivating. Unfortunately, Philip's story gets lost in alot of garbage--holy cow! This book has way too much utterly useless description. At times, I felt like I did when I read Moby Dick in school--I felt as if the interesting story was buried between over-done descriptions of whale blubber."
3,"Interesting, but not the Best Alternative History Book","I have never read any of Roth's books before, and only picked this one up because it sounding like a very interesting premise.I won't go into the details of the plot, as they have been summarized already here. But I will go into my reactions while reading the book. I thought it was very well executed, and thought it was an interesting choice to make himself the major character as a young boy. And I totally felt anger and rage at the way the characters were being treated (particularly Mrs. Wishnow)So he had me up until the end. I simply did not like the ending. Normally, I don't mind a book that leaves me with more questions than answers, and wondering what became of the characters. But in this case I felt really cheated. I was left with a feeling of ""Is that it?"""
4,An entertaining idea bookends some draggy sections,"I was totally caught up in the story from the first couple of chapters, and the final couple of chapters blew me away...but things dragged and crept for me in the middle of those experiences. Great idea lovingly executed. Once you're past the first hundred pages or so, take a deep breath and push on quickly to get to the final hundred pages."
2,"good start, then a disappointment","Here is the GOOD news about Roth's novel:He has a daring imagination.The dystopian world is not of the future, but of a possible past.Remarkable research.Blend of personal with history.Now the sad, BAD news:The book begins with a young Phil Roth as the narrator. The early scenes--especially when the family goes to Washington DC--are vivid and excellent. However for some unknown reason, Roth drops the first person / youngster view almost totally.The style is often overwritten; it becomes more of an essay than a story. Too much tiresome passive tense.Roth summarizes far too many events, as if he is a distant historian rather than an involved narrator/character."
3,"Good, but poorly paced.","The overall book is a good read, but there were some moments where I just felt like putting it down for good. The last 50 pages, though, were worth the wait. A surprisingly clever and plausible twist to end a long story about fascism in America."
2,Not Their Best,"""Lay It on Me"" is this CD's best track. It's a bizzare combination of stop and start strings, a gravelly ""country"" vocal by Maurice, and lyrics that are way way out there. Funny thing is, it works!Wish I could say that for the rest of the album. Maurice seems to be the only Gibb here who has his heart in this project. Barry, and especially Robin, seem to be calling this one in.The ""Two Years On"" refers to a two year period that the band split up. This is one of two albums released in 1971, the other being ""Trafalgar""- also available at Amazon. ""Trafalgar"" is far superior, but ""Two Years On"" was released first, so for that reason alone, this CD does have a place in Bee Gee history.You don't get a lot of collaborations or trademark Bee Gee harmony here- what you do get is the equivilent of ""The White Album""- each singer takes his turn at the mike. Only difference is, this entire effort is weak.Marginal recommendation at best."
2,Great Single,"This ""reunion"" album provides the NO.1 hit ""Lonely Days""...and there's no denying that it's a wonderful song. But there aren't too many other highlights here. Most of the songs seem to be leftovers from the Brother's unsuccessful and shortlived solo careers. The title track is an exception with Robin apparently recounting his ""Two Years"" away from his siblings. The recording itself sounds muddled and not up to the standards even at that time. One of their weaker efforts."
2,The Three Perspectives Reunion,"Barry Gibb once mentioned that ""2 Years On"" was the weakest album the trio had recorded. True. Granted that it garnered the huge American hit ""Lonely Days"", the rest of the album seems like leftovers from their attempts at solo careers. Wince while listening to ""I'm Weeping"". Shake your head in bewilderment at ""Tell Me Why"". ""Lay It On Me"" passes the test, but it seems Maurice shot his entire solo wad on that one. Do note however, that the song ""2 Years On"" is a rare early Robin and Maurice collaboration. ""Man For All Seasons"" clearly hints at the Gibbs' easily obtained falsettos to come. ""The 1st Mistake I Made"" is a surprising success, if a bit long. Strong emotional strings and guitar/piano riffs can't help but 'get you'. Otherwise the remainder of the songs are 'fluff'. This 'fluff' led to a magnificnet album less than a year later. The fantastic ""Trafalgar""; the album that brought the Brothers Gibb into maturity."
4,Phenomenous attempt.,"Don't get me wrong. This album has wonderful songs in it. Where would Lonely Days be without this album? And then there's Man For All Seasons, another little hit. Portrait of Louise has beautiful voices in it, and so does the very catchy Alone Again. Every Second, Every Minute is another great solo by Barry. Lay It On Me is almost horrible, and Tell Me Why is quite boring. Overall, some great songs, some good songs, and just a couple dull songs makes this a good enough album to want."
4,Great idea,"The reason I selected this particular product was because my wife had visited the Holy Land and regretted not getting a olive wood nativity set. The characters are just as I imagined they would be. Each has a full featured face and folded hands and other intricate carvings distinguishing them from the other pieces. My mother-in-law even noted that Joseph's eyes twinkled (which tickled my wife). The problem is that this is a delicate set-up (it's carved wood, after all). I received the produce in a timely manner but en route it had snapped in half and had other pieces broken off, as well. As soon as I get done with this review, my wife has directed me to go to the local do-it-yourself center to buy some wood glue to glue the pieces back together. Except for the broken part(s), it really is a great gift idea and my wife really liked it. Really, really."
3,"very basic, good for first time drummer","Very basic handmade construction & beater is tiny but it is my first talking drum & will do until I can get a pro model, it sounds allot better than it looks but for what I paid for it I am happy with it."
5,a chef d'oeuvre,"Excellent album. Richness and diversity in the words and melodies, it's perfect till the last details. Without hesitation, one of my favorite CD's."
5,The BETTER French Artist,"Hi, i'm french, and i can tell you that Pascal Obispo is one of the most talented artist of his generation. He's written a musical comedy on the theme ""Les 10 Commandements"" (The Ten Commands ?) and it's Fantastic !You have to listen to him, because he's one of the best french singer, writer, artist"
5,If you Liked Snow Flower and the Secret Fan you will love...,"The Ginger tree is a remarable book, well written with a good story line. It brings to light much about a culture other than our own."
2,The Ginger Tree review,"A friend recommended this book to me. Since I am a reader and a writer, I take interest in suggestions. I find thus far (at about page 50) that the book has some merits as a travel log. I questioned at first if a man could pull off writing from the first person stand point of a young Victorian woman. While some of the writing carries me along, I am mostly plodding my way through looking for interesting spots. I enjoy, however, being able to look things up on Amazon, and almost always finding the titles available."
3,Implausible,"I just got tired of this book way before the end. And I found the set-up implausible. I had difficulty believing a woman of Mary's era would actually behave in this way. It sucked me in at the beginning, and I felt that was the best part of the book in every way: the plot, the writing, the ambience, the sense of place. But by the end, well, I barely finished reading it."
4,Low cost straplocks...,"These Strap buttons are ideal for straps with thin, or soft ends. The extra-wide head on these buttons help to hold the strap well. One caution though, if you have a thick, or stiff leather strap, be prepared to wrestle with it a bit to get it on the guitar!"
5,Tigger Movie,We received the DVD quicker than we expected. Our boys are really enjoying it!! The movie was in excellent condition and as stated. We are very glad that we took the chance and ordered it.
5,Very impressed,"I didn't expect the movie to be in such great shape, I am very pleased with my order and so are my daughters."
3,A nice kid's movie,Bit it should have been a bit longer. 77 minutes is not enough. I have always loved Disneys animation of the Winnie the Pooh tv show and I was way excited when I first learned of this movie. 100 acre wood looks magical and is presented very well on DVD.The story itself is a bit childish but still manages to have balls when it has Tigger FAIL to find his family. Although I would have liked him too I respect the ending they went for.Although this film isn't to everyone's tastes (I know it seems a little fruity a guy of 20 can like this film) I say you should buy this DVD. It's pefect child fodder and good entertainment. Not just family entertainment. Should be longer though.The DVD is in Dolby 5.1 and is anamorphically enhanced at 1.66:1.
2,Not as whimsical as the original Winnie-the-Pooh,"I bought this for my daughter thinking it would be as light-hearted and whimsical as the original Pooh. It's not even close. There are some scary scenes in this movie ( i.e. Tigger in a snow avalanche), which I was not expecting. It's also kind of a dark movie with a depressed and dejected Tigger looking for his family. A little bit of a complicated storyline for a Tigger movie ( not the simple story of Pooh and honeypots and bouncing Tiggers and gloomy Eeyore, etc.). I was looking for a movie with the ""fun,fun,fun,fun,fun"" Tigger. Basically, if you are looking for a sequel to Pooh - this is NOT IT. Try the ""Book of Pooh"" instead."
5,dvd gift,I believe my granddaughter and grandkids will love this gift. They just recieved it yesterday.
4,The Wonderful thing about Tiggers!,"I just watched this movie a few days ago and the only reason why I had to give it 4 stars as opposed to 5 was because the music was not up to par with other Disney flicks. There was no song that you could keep on singing. But overall, this was a great movie. It was very touching and had good messages about the importance of having good friends and also being a good friend. I really enjoyed this movie and as a Tigger fan it was great to hear Tigger sing the Tigger song. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
3,Not a fan of Kenny Loggins!,"I can't stand that song, I did not care too much for the movie. The characters are cute and all but the plot was a little too sad for a small child to watch. How about they make a movie starring Eeyore at least then we would know why its so depressing."
2,"Even my toddler recognized this as a ""B"" movie.","This movie should not have been shown in theaters. If we had first encountered it on TV, we might have been pleasantly distracted. But going to the movies just to see something this hollow and forgettable is frustrating indeed. The plot was transparent, the songs were fluff. Even though I said nothing to express my own disappointment, when I asked my preschooler what he thought of it, he replied, ""Well, it wasn't a great movie. Was it really from Disney?""Still, it is sweet, harmless entertainment for kids. And that's something."
1,Bad Seller,"1. It took 26 days to get this DVD2. It is coded to region 2 not North America3. Languages such as Greek are on this disk4. It is unplayable even on my computer because there are bad sectors in addition to being the wrong regional code5. Seller would not return e-mail, Luckly Amazon was able to get me a refundI wish I could give it zero stars but that would not let me submit the review."
3,tigger movie vhs,Great movie. Low low price to help charitable organization. But box was dirty & partly broken when arrived. Worked well & very cute!
5,The Tigger Movie 10th Anniversary Edition,"Product cover and case were in great shape, as was the DVD, saved on travel time and gas money and got it fast and at a great price."
5,Saving for Valentine's Day or Easter,"I ordered this movie with hopes that it would make it for Christmas, but since I was late in ordering I am now saving the movie for my youngest daughter for Valentine's Day or Easter! I am looking forward to her reaction when she does get to watch it. I think she'll be thrilled! Shipping was very quick!! (I paid for standard shipping...I just ordered too late.)"
2,Classic Disney Characters Fail To Dazzle,"Tepid, dull Pooh movie that not only bored me but depressed me. One has to feel somewhat bad for Tigger and his lonely life as portrayed in the film. Even the songs are lackluster, all sounding very much like eachother with no real effect on the movie. Still the characters are cute and kids will probably like it. But in my opinion our kids deserve better entertainment."
2,Tigger Can Jump High for a Tiger,"Okay, here's a rundown of what The Tigger Movie has to offer for teens who are trying to look cool so their friends won't totally hate them:1. There's one interesting song number where Tigger talks about his family. You see all kinds of Tiggers, from a Jerry Springer Tigger to a Marilyn Monroe Tigger. It's pretty interesting.2. The movie can be campy sometimes if you're in the mood.3. If you play the guitar, try playing that simple guitar picking that's found in the movie and impress your little sister.4. It'll make you appreciate good, family films like Fargo and Bringing Out the Dead. Go buy them so Amazon can make some money.Well, that's it. I wouldn't compare it to Disney's Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, etc., but for the wee kids, it's not bad. The songs aren't really memorable, but look at the bright side: that means they won't be stuck in your head!"
3,Very cute movie but . . .,"This is a really cute movie but it's the standard cartoon style. My son is addicted to My Friends Tigger and Pooh and the more computer animated style. I didn't even think to check the format of this when I ordered it (my bad), so if you're wanting something other than traditional cartoon, this isn't the video you want."
5,Great case,"Smooth leather on the outside. Smooth cloth on the inside. Doesn't scratch my nexus 7.If you've got a nexus 7 that you want to put in your purse or bag, and don't want to worry about it getting scratched. This is a great solution."
5,new haven daily bread clock,it was just what i wanted but cheaper than other places i checked 4 it =thank u i had been trying 2 find it 4 a while
4,E. A. Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination,"Having never read Edgar Allen Poe I was quite pleased with his writing. One of my favorite stories out of the plethera of choices was the Gold Bug. At first I was relucant to continue with the book. It was going slow and was hard to interpret. Then in the middle of the story it picked up pace and had some mystery and magic in it. I became fixed with reading it and figuring out how they found the treasure and how it was all possible. The process of the way the treasure was found was fantastic. This book has many of Poe's greatest writings. And that is what made it great. You didn't ahve to get a lot of books to read many of his stories, you could simply just get one and read many. This book contained many great short stories. It is a must read."
2,Great illustrations but poor reading typography,"It's an expensive book with only THREE stories from the whole of Edgar Allan Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination. From the title and reviews I thought I'm getting the whole book, with illustrations only for three of the stories. That aside, the illustrations are great! Unfortunately, the reading text is also set in the ornate typography used for the title. While it works very well used as display typography - for titles, chapter headings, etc., this typeface is very unsuitable for reading as text. The book jacket is also slightly yellow around the edges, with a bit of the lamination peeling off. (Guess it's a very old stock. I've got a replacement from Amazon and both books are the same.)"
4,Content - 5 stars; Engineering - 3 stars = 4 star average,"As many other reviewers have stated, this is indeed an excellent sampler, with great performances, and it's a perfect introduction to opera. What's annoying is the fact that the technical quality of the disk is haphazard. These are excerpts compiled from 30 or more different recordings, but the sound engineers didn't equalize the volume from one track to the next, so I found myself constantly adjusting the loudness -- some tracks are significantly softer than others. Also, some tracks cut off rather abruptly, I suppose because they were trying to squeeze as many different showpieces on to the discs as possible. Nonetheless, if you're looking for a great Overview of Opera CD, you won't go wrong with this one."
5,Stupendous!,"This is the most outstanding compilation of operas' beautiful music I've ever heard! If the La Boheme selections don't raise the hair on your arms, you're not breathing!"
4,Great CD- Overload of Pavoratti though,"This is an excellent CD. The versions chosen of the songs are in general quite excellent. In fact, I am getting married in about a month and we are using several of the songs from this CD in the ceremony. The ONLY real complaint I have about this CD is that there is ENTIRELY too much Pavoratti (sp?) on it. I would have liked a bit more variety in the male singers department. Although I do enjoy Pavoratti in general, there are some songs and parts of songs where he sounds like a cat being dragged around a room (sorry Pavi fans!). Otherwise- EXCELLENT. Two thumbs up!"
5,The #1 Opera Album,"21 Dec, 2007The movements in this collection move Me as much as My very bowel. Hence, it might work for your too. Try it, you'll like it if you want to be moved to your very ""soul""."
5,Opera Albums in General,This album is truly representative of some of the best arias in opera. I really enjoyed it. The singing was marvelous and I couldn't have asked for a better selection.
2,The Opera #1 Opera Album,The music is wonderful. The production is terrible!! The sound fades in and out and is very scratchy in some places.
1,Don't Buy This CD,"I hate to go against the crowd but there are so many better compilations of these pieces. To name just one, Aria: a Passion for Opera is much better. The choice of singers is not great on this cd. How do you pick 'E Lucevan le stelle' without selecting the version by Franco Corelli? Same for 'Di Quella Pira.' I admit there are some fine moments but not enough to make this cd worth the price."
4,It's About Time: America's Imprisonment Binge,It's hard to rate since it was sent direct to my teen at college. No complaints so I guess it was ok.
2,A Reviewer from Canada,"I have a previous version of this DVD. However it is two side and not convenient. I wait for a new version like this one for a long time. Unfortunately, this ""Superbit"" DVD picture quality is not good. I fully agree the review of another reviewer on Dec/17/2003. The only benefit I got from this DVD is ""One Side""."
4,Pure enjoyment,"I ordered the DVD just after i saw 'Riverdance-behind the scenes"" on TV. never heard of Riverdance before. I was (and still am) amazed and speechless when saw those dancers and what they can do with their feet. I also liked the Irish music. This DVD top quality is the Soundtrack, and if you can get 5 speakers surround soundtrack and even watch the fine video (Although not using the full potential of the DVD medium) - why not take it ?Do'nt expect too much of it. there are some ""relaxed"" scenes - but some scenes will mesmerize you !Pure enjoyment !"
5,The Best of All the Riverdance Shows,"I have seen this particular show several times on video that I rented a few years back. I have never been able to find it anywhere since, in any video store or anywhere else. I have also seen the other Riverdance shows done in New York and Geneva, but this show is by far, the BEST Riverdance show ever! The collaboration of the Riverdance Company, Bill Whelan, Michael Flatley and everyonelse that was involved in this show is just pure magic! As much as I have enjoyed seeing the other Riverdance shows and Michael Flatley's Lord of the Dance -- there just seems to be something very special about this show! Hope you will get it reproduced very soon!"
3,Too distant,"I have seen it live and the dvd just isn't the same. Music is all the same, dancing is great. Needs more close ups to see expression on the faces."
4,Flat without Flatley,"Seemed a reprise of an earlier Riverdance, without the excitement that Michael Flatley provided. However, none of the releases post Riverdance the Show, met the high water mark of the original. Lord of the Dance, too much spectacle, not enough focus on dance that the original Riverdance portrayed so well. Really want a DVD of Riverdance the Show, with full quality of the recent DVD releases. In the meantime, I'll keep what I have and enjoy both DVD's, Riverdance-Live from NYC, and Lord of the Dance and the VHS tape of Riverdance the Show."
1,Technically this DVD is a Disaster,"Terrific performance. Choppy editing. I was looking forward to getting this wide screen Superbit DVD. What a disappointment! First of all, it's not wide screen--it's actually SHORT screen. On a wide screen TV it takes less space than a ""full screen"" 4:3 DVD or VHS tape. That is, large black bands on the sides and narrower black bands on the top and bottom. One can try the ""zoom"" function on the TV, but with two unfortunate consequences: You lose the top and bottom of the pucture and you make the already very poor definition picture even worse. Superbit indeed! In short, though described as ""anamorphic"" on the box, it surely is NOT. It's extremely fuzzy on my 50"" monitor, much more so than almost any of the many dance DVDs that we own. As another reviewer suggested, they could have produced this travesty by simply copying a VHS tape. Superbit? Forget it!"
4,Looking for the Michael Flately,"I have been looking for the original Riverdance spirit and Michael's performance. I bought the book and the CD of the music, but I wanted Michael Flately's performance, not Colin Dunne's and all the extra junk that has been shoveled into the show. It was all I could have wished for and more."
5,FANTASTIC !,Unbelievable dance performance and exciting music ! I enjoy watching it while on excercise equipment. Always see something different and the music helps adrenaline going.
1,WTF Happened?,"This is not about Riverdance.This is about what this disc did to murder it.I popped it in, expecting to see my favorite dance scenes (while conveiniently skipping the singing), when all of a sudden I'm at the finale. All I could say was ""WTF?!"", ""WTH?!"", or words to that effect.This ""SuperBit"" edition cuts out half -- HALF -- of the scenes this performance had to offer, including (but certainly not limited to) Riverdance and Trading Taps.Not only that, but (unless the ""high def"" only works for high-end TVs) the video quality is equal to my old VHS copy.I sincerely hope this problem only occurs on my copy, but I suggest to get a refund webpage ready, because the atrocious product I received royally screws this great perform up the ---!"
4,We miss Michael!,"We thoroughly enjoyed this video. Some of the slower numbers from the original Riverdance video have been removed from the show (possibly to compete with the faster-paced ""Lord of the Dance)."" Colin is a brilliant dancer, although Jean Butler seems to tower over him in some of the numbers. Michael Flatley is not to everybody's taste, but we personally missed his special brand of flamboyance. The rewind button will be used again and again to watch some of the more brilliant numbers, most notably when the entire Riverdance troupe dance together. Highly recommended."
2,Poor video production of an outstanding performance,"I saw Riverdance at the Auditorium Theatre in Chicago in a production very similar to the one on this videotape performed and recorded live at Radio City Music Hall. What I saw on the video was a small fraction of the sensational dancing demonstrated by the performers I saw in person. That is because there are far more shots showing the head, torso and theatre than full-body dancing. Just as soon as you think you are really going see some fabulous dancing the camera cuts away. I think the tape editors were too into the art of video and not at all into the art of DANCE. It was very frustrating to watch this videotape."
1,"Great show, dreadful video","I saw the show with Colin Dunne, and was delighted with it. But the video was a dreadful disappointment. The direction is nothing less than atrocious. There is constant cutting from one angle to another, and to closeups of feet and faces.After a while I began timing the shots. The average length of time before each change of camera: Five seconds. To film such extraordinary dancers in this flashy, incredibly distracting way is a slap in the face to dancers and audience alike. This is an unwatchable disaster of a video."
3,Overediting Destroys a Fabulous Show,"I loved Riverdance. I have seen it live twice. And every time I pull this DVD out and watch it, it makes me crazy. It is so over edited it is almost impossible to watch. There are far too many shots that are closeups of the dancers faces or long shots that are so far away the dancers are specs on the stage. In both cases you just can't see the dancing. I was so glad to read all the reviews that reaffirmed this view. I just wish I had read them beforehand. I don't know that it would have kept me from buying the DVD (I use it to listen to the music now), but at least I would have been prepared."
5,Riverdance spectacular,"This is a show one can watch again and again. The setting, the music and dancing are all superb. Very well done, but not overdone, it is sure to delight anyone who watches it."
2,Disappointing for anyone who's seen the show,"I've seen the live show 3 times now, and this DVD is a disappointment. The video is fuzzy, the audio lacks the bass ""feel"" (the audio CD has MUCH better sound). If you've never seen the live show, have little chance of ever seeing it, and don't buy VHS, then you might like this DVD. Otherwise, save your money. I gave it two stars SOLELY because it's Riverdance."
3,it's not the original,"I only watched the first routine of the NYC show so maybe it gets better but I got a headache trying to watch the dance. I don't remember the direction being so bad in the original show. We aren't allowed to see what's going on as the angles and cameras change every 5 seconds, from a zoom of shoes moving in and out of view to little figures moving on a stage and anything and everything inbetween. I found it too painful to watch."
5,I still have my childhood copy....and cherish it.,"I couldn't agree more with the two previous reviewer's comments. Not only is Cheerful the sweetest story for a young child to hear... preferably read aloud - The size of the book is also something to note. It's small scale is just the right size for a young child to curl up with. I have only known one other person who knew about Cheerful, and she held on to her copy too...that must say something about the lasting impact this little book has on a young mind. In the end it's all about goodness and finding meaning and happiness in one's life. Palmer Brown made this concept accessible even to the youngest of audiences. If you can find a copy...don't hesitate to buy it and please share it with a little one in your life."
5,super cool duo,"born jamericans are ace, i am a huge fan and love the kids from foreign album.it would be cool if they got back as a duo and performed another album."
3,Not my favorite of his work,"While some of John Crooke's work is among my all time favorite music, this is not on that list. He's as creative and masterful a story teller as usual, but the melodies don't always resolve or repeat in a memorable way and I'm afraid I'm trained by pop and rock to want a hummable tune. This is perfect for my friend who loves the less structured musics of jazz and folk, so it's now a gift which I think he'll love, but for me, I prefer early Jolene to the more artistic endeavors of Tongue."
1,Total rip-off!,"I bought an Invicta Men's 2875 II Collection Chronograph Watch for my husband as a Christmas gift in December 2009. I noticed in May that he hardly ever wore it and asked why. He said it worked for about 2 weeks and stopped, so he just returned to his old cheap watch. I assumed it was a battery but couldn't open the back myself and FINALLY got to a jeweler last week to get a new battery. The jeweler installed the battery and the watch worked for a couple of hours and stopped again. So, for $65 plus the cost of a replacement battery, we got about 2 weeks of function. Now it's too late to return - all I can do is sit and burn."
5,Great Value for a Watch!,"I am a Big fan of watches, and decided to start spreading my love of watches via gift giving. My close friend had been helping me out with a lot of things, and I noticed he had only ever had one watch. In my opinion, every man should have his choice of watches and cars on any given day, but that's another story.. I decided to give him this watch as a dress watch, and another as a daily/sport watch. Upon receiving this watch, I was admittedly jealous! It's a great looking watch, with fantastic attention to detail, and pretty good material and build quality. AND it has complications!! No complaints here! He now has a rotation, and while this doesn't get worn as much, it is reserved for times when a nicer looking watch may be more noticeable.Bottom line?Great Standard sized value priced dress watch. At this price, it could be worn every day and replaced, if so inclined."
3,Decent watch,I have a penchant for watches and normally my favorite watches are the swiss army brand (Victorinox) but wanted to try the Invicta brand but had gotten mixed reviews. I purchased two of them from Amazon and I have to say that while others may have had bad experiences this particular one is pretty decent and works well. I have not encountered any problems and it has not faded as some claim. My other Invicta is also a decent watch and was admired by my co-workers. So far so good no problems and happy with my watch but if you can spend more get a Fossil or Swiss Army better quality and better warranty.
4,Fancy Watch,Nice watch. A bit fancier than what I'd want an everyday watch to be. But great for times when dressing up is a must.
1,Quality Issues,"After two months of owning the watch and only wearing it at work (software company,) I noticed I had two VII's with an I missing. I later found the broken I from the eight at the bottom of the watch. After another month of wearing, the rest of the eight fell apart leaving a V, I, and I randomly getting stuck between the hands causing the watch to be unusable."
1,You get what you pay for...,"I was lured by the pictures and ignored the negative reviews and decided to take a chance on this based on the cheap price at the time. 6 months later the seconds hand has fallen off and is now sliding across the face of the watch and the battery already needs replaced. The watch was exposed to normal everyday use and given the issues already, I am not even going to bother getting it repaired...straight to the trash for this one. Buyer beware!"
4,Madness... Such Beauty!,"This book was like nothing I have ever read before. The detail that was shown throughout the book really was able to make me see what it might have looked like, sounded like, felt like and sometimes even smelled like being in an asylum. The amount of information that Roy Porter put into this book was amazing. You might have thought he haad been in an asylum himself. I would absolutely recommend this book to anyone."
4,Madness in Social Context,"Ror Porter's excellent book places the history of madness within specific social contexts. We get a full picture of the perception of madness primarily as an emblem of difference which serves as a trigger for rejection by the dominant social forces of communities. Individuals outside the dominant social groups are confined, placed in asylums, and made invisible; Porter reveals to us that the ""mad"" weren't necessarily ill or disordered, but often individuals that were seen as a blight on the facade of cities---single women, orphaned children, the disabled, or artists whose freedom was considered a threat to more conservative rulers of town and country. Porter's description of madness as illness is equally compelling. He writes with elegance, style, and clarity. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent description of the development of Psychiatry/Psychology,"Mr. Porter, in this small book, traces the development of thought about madness from pre-history through post-modern psychology. Excellently done, in a way that makes each developmental step make sense."
3,Enjoying it,"This book seems very well researched. It is very interesting. Unfortunately the author comes across as showing you that his vocabulary is superior to your own. Normally I wouldn't mind but in this case it makes the book less enjoyable. If the author would've employed a more common vernacular it would flow More naturally And I think it would illuminate what he is trying to explain to the reader. If you can get over the pretentious quality of the authorship, the book is enjoyable and Insightful."
2,Factual but dry read,This is more of a mini-text book than an interesting read. If you want to use this book for its facts and info by all means read it. If you bought if for a casual read and personal entertainment this book is about as exciting as checkers. Its a dry read and reads like a text book in school. I got bored half way thru and stopped reading.
4,"Good service, but otherwise a waste of money","It is no fault of the seller that this is largely a waste of money. The seller did a rather good job of delivering the product swiftly, though it was a little bit bunged up in spots. Nothing serious, though, and not enough to detract from the games within. However, these games are available for free on the Internet, and while I thought, at first, that there were problems with the copy protection that needed original copies to circumvent, I have found this assumption to be completely wrong. While the seller does good work, and I would buy other things from them, I have to advise potential buyers to find these games online instead, freely and, as far as I can tell, legally."
1,Does not include access codes,"After installing one game, I tried to play it. It says to use the code wheel to decipher the access code for the game. No code wheel was included, so the game is permanently locked.Tried running a few more games, but they would not run at all on windows XP.The huge, poor quality PDF manual is a big pain unless you print it out and index it."
2,Classic Lousiness,"When I first saw this in the stores I jumped at the chance to own fourteen classic AD&D games. When I got home I was incredibly dissapointed. The first thing that bothered me was the installation: Each game had to be installed separately, there was no way to install all the games at once.After I got them all installed the problems really showed up. I didn't expect the game to be of a very high quality, but most of the games had copy protects (older games require passwords and such to actually play the game). I had expected this, however the included documentation was so lousy I never made it into most of the games.I found around four of the games playable, and somewhat entertaining. It's price isn't bad at all so if you're dissapointed you won't miss your money, that much. The bottom line is, unless your a diehard AD&D CRPG fan skip this."
5,Buy it if you love mozart and violin,"I bought this CD set a couple of months back. I'm glad to to say that I've enjoyed it throughly so far. I also have a copy of the rather polished recording of Violin Concertos 3 and 5 that Mutter made with Karajan, and I find the new one seems to have greater energy and emotions. Both the set of recordings are to be cherished in their own right.The Sinfonia Concertante is to die for! I've not heard a better recording, especially the Presto."
5,A must have,"Anne Sophie Mutter shows her Karajan's legacy. She played in a perfect way. The music she developed is something amazing. Her technique is so mature, very academical, very german.Mozart violin concertos (most 3 & 5th) are one of the finest creations and this material is so well performed that can provoke addiction to Mutter's recordings (I take for granted that Mozart is very addictive).Simply Precious."
1,not good at all,"This product had cocunat oil which I did not know about until I got it, which I am allergic to. The ingrentions should be listed before you buy. My husbund did not think they tasted good at all."
5,just what was advertised,The book I requested and received was exactly as promised. There was prompt and efficient delivery and it was in perfect condition.
4,Quick delivery,Received this item very quickly -item is exactly as described. Would buy from this seller again
4,Nice 6x9 envelope.,"This is a nice envelope. I shopped around and considered before ordering, and after receiving and using, like them. The white color makes a nice clean looking envelope (compared to the brown color). I wasnt familiar with this type of seal, but it works well, it is plenty wide enough to make a strong & secure seal, altho it is possible to re-open it without ruining it. The sticky, on both sides, allows them to be stacked in the box they come in without sticking together, but when you seal the 2 sticky edges together it seals quite well. The only drawback for me is that the white paper allows print to possibly show thru, I would prefer a security interior. Another great thing about this envelope is that current postal regulations call this 6x9 envelope a 'letter', as long as it's less than 1/4"" thick, and uses the same postage as any letter ($0.44/oz); but if you buy a 6.5 x 9.5 envelope, offered elsewhere, it is considered a 'large envelope' which costs $0.80 for the first ounce."
4,Step by Step Farsi Conversation,Easiest method learning to speak Fasi without attending a class. I have recommended this to friends.
4,Good product for the price...,"I bought this as a way to jump start my wish to learn Farsi. I bought this last week and am on the fourth lesson. So far, the lessons are easy to follow. I am aware that it doesn't have everything that a formal class would, but for the price, I think it works well. I am also supplementing with other materials I purchased. Hope this review helps!"
4,Learn By Repetition,"This product starts you with the conversation of meeting someone new. Repeating each word several times adding vocabulary to it as you learn. You will discover the grammer as other verbs are added, without having to engage in complicated grammer learning and sentencing structure. The same material is used in other lesseons, therefore constant repetition makes it finally stick. 30 minutes each day, stay with it, and you'll learn to communicate the language, as my wife is doing. I already know Farsi."
3,Kingdom Hearts Trading Cards,Didn't know there were trading cards for Kingdom Hearts. My 11 y.o. son seem to enjoy them.
4,Great for little animal lovers,"Barney always puts a smile on my face and on the faces of my twin girls.He, Baby Bob and the gang are always full of laughter and good spirits.My girls loved the ""dancing"" in this video and instantly thought of sharing the fun with their cousins.Whenever you can mix fun and education within one video you have created a wonderful addition to your family library.If your child enjoys learning about animals and their homes...this is an excellent DVD to pick up. Barney might be a big, purple dinosaur but he is also a wonderful way to entertain and interact with your children on a level they will appreciate.Barney: Jungle Friends"
3,Barney videos,"Barney is about friendship, acceptance of others and being there for you. The videos have little teaching about important educational concepts."
3,Would Not Recommend For Sole Source Of Material,This is not the only book you should have! Lots of material considering reference integrity are NOT well cover (1 paragraph). Answers to question are frequently wrong and NOT as well written as the Sybex books. Take your chances here.
4,Good enough but should be better,"I used this book along with Technet(Backoffice resource kit) and the SQL books online to prepare for the exam, on which I scored an 881. I have a couple year's experience with the product, but not 'in-depth', so there were several topics where I needed a good tutorial. This book filled that need and is written directly to the exam 'objectives'; problem is, I don't think the MS exam was reflective of the stated 'objectives'. So there were several questions on the exam that this book didn't prep well for (like application development and SQL OLE, DMF, ODS, etc, and replication--the publishing subscriber model wasn't even mentioned). But reading the corresponding MS documentation with each topic (a LOT of reading!) covers most of the bases. The practice exams were mediocre. I recommend this book."
4,SQL Server Training is an excellent resource!,"Overall, this book is an excellent guide in preparation for the SQL 6.5 Administration exam. The content is well written, thorough, and contains many great exercises and study questions. The book has 6 authors and the inconsitency amongst them does show from time to time. The overall flow is most preserved though. The chapter on replication could be more thorough, or at least more clearly written. Overall, however, this is an excellent resource and definately a good value for the discounted price offered by Amazon."
2,Not impressed,"Seeing as I purchased this for a textbook for a college class I expected it to be factual. And I was reading the textbook as though it was based purely on science. Up until I got to the chapter that included ""spirituality"", discussed god as a necessity to wellness and promoted abstinance only sex education. Um, let's take religion out of textbooks, please. Because when I got to that part, I hence concluded that the entire textbook was not at all scientific. Too bad."
1,bad!,"This is my first time using Amazon, and I got a wrong textbook that I do not need! I'm so disappointed!"
1,Missing Pages,The book is missing a lot of pages. It doesn't seem like the pages were taken out. Then on later chapters it has the repeated pages. It's all of out of order. I'm very disappointed because I trusted AMAZON.
1,Don't buy,"Length:: 0:43 MinsThí book is cheap compared any others in bookstores. But I recommend you should not buy this. It has about 30 pages repeated. I didn't know til the teacher went over these pages. A student in my class bought her book from Amazon with exact same problem as mine. I have a video, so if you consider buying this one. You might want to take a look at my video before purchase.P/S: Except the repeated pages, everything else is great (price, shipping,good condition...)"
5,Great information.,This book teaches you how to build your own program for working out and nutrition. I am also taking the college class for it.
3,Average,"This book was ""average"" for a textbook.The graphs and charts are excellent, however the author is not very engaging while presenting the material."
4,way to go Lol,i enjoyed this album very much. Cindy reminds me of jeanette laundry's voice on the glove album. I will have a full review up shortly.liverpool mighty reds (greatest team in the history of time)
2,Lovely drawings not enough,"Beautifully expansive pencil drawings don't entirely redeem this disappointing story. Yeah, yeah, I know that meeting a tramp in a vacant lot near the railway happened to the author and all, but the anecdote needed more focus to make a successful tale."
5,Mission Impossible,"Golden Buddha (The Oregon Files)I have always been a Clive Cussler fan and this is a fast moving and complex story and one must pay attention or you will get lost. I'm looking forward to the second book in this series, ""The sacred stone"""
1,"Cliff notes, not a real book","This was like reading the cliff notes about a book instead of the book itself. It was more a skeleton of a story than a novel. There were too many characters and plot lines, and none of them were developed well at all. Halfway through I decided that I just didn't care anymore. Not a single character was memorable. Obviously the name Clive Cussler has been put up for sale and any author willing to meet the price can get their work published- as a co-author. This book wasn't an adventure- it was a dud, IMO."
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,I never do not finish a book. Well that all changed with this tedious quagmire of detail. Complete snooze. Do NOT bother.
1,Oregon series for young readers?,"I read ""Arctic Drift"" by Cussler and thought it was great. I read a little bit about the author and thought I would start at the beginning and I was excited to hopefully read all his books. I started with ""the Oregon Series, Golden Buddha."" I read and read, thinking this would start to make sense or maybe the unbelievable aspects would stop happening. Well they didn't, I read where others think Cussler had not even read this and I have to agree, it is impossible to follow and so unbelievable it is absurd. I bought the first two in the series for Kindle and I want my money back!"
1,Cussler fans- don't waste your time and money,"Mr. Cussler, please don't lend your revered name to such poorly written stuff as ""The Oregon File"" series. Your name on the cover, and your pic on the back may sell books to your loyal fans, but will quickly destroy our faith."
1,"Too bad, so bad.","It seems as if more and more people who have made a recognizable name for themselves by giving us a good product (Yes, books are a product) then decide to up their income by allowing some other product use that name, i.e., a movie star putting her name on a bottle of perfume. I see that here. Cussler's name is proudly bannered across the top of the book but it is certainly not Cussler inside. I wonder if he even read it. If he has and still allowed this to go to the publishers means that he has absolutely no respect for his readers."
3,Not as Bad as Everyone is Saying!,"My entire family are big fans of Clive Cussler and eagerly await for his next adventure. I think the mistake most of us make is in comparing apples to oranges. I think we can all agree that we love the adventures of Dirk Pitt, But I for one also love the adventures of Kurt Austin (actually written by Paul Kemprecos)but not for the same reasons (again, I don't compare the two series to one another}. Let's go back and look at the first few Dirk Pitt adventures and compare them to the latest Pitt tomes, We can probably say they were crap, But the characters and writing and stories improved in time as it also did with Kurt Austin. Although I agree that this is not the greatest Clive Cussler book ever written I eagerly await the next installment in this series and will have as much fun watching these characters and stories develop as I have Dirk and Kurt. Clive and Craig, Thanks for giving me more adventures to look forward to."
1,rubbish!,8.99 for an older book that you cannot resell or loan to others is rubbish! Even worse that it wasn't even written by Cussler! Sorry. One star is being generous.
1,How dumb does Cussler think the reading public is?,"While Cussler's books are not always up to the same standard, I never thought I'd write a bad review of one of them. But this effort is so bad, it's insulting.Anyone who remembers the old Mission:Impossible TV series will recognize this type of plot, though this particular rendition is so overly-stretched and overly-detailed and overly-populated with cardboard characters that it reads like a schematic.I realize that Cussler must be bored by now and wants to extend his franchise by handing over the reins to other writers, but so far his efforts have failed. While the NUMA series is at least mildly interesting, this debut of the Oregon Files series reads like nonfiction (surprise, surprise), and dull nonfiction at that.The fact that this went straight to paperback should have been a clue, like movies that go direct to video/DVD without ever having been released in theatres.Save your money. This is a dog."
2,Golden Buddha-A Golden Bummer,"If you like the Dirk Pitt series & the Kurt Austin series, don't bother reading this book! The action is NOT there, nor is the intrigue that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series. This book was not as 'action-packed' as the two other series, and left me wishing the book to be over. I had to 'make' myself finish the book, and even then, my only comment was ""That's it?!"" It's definitely NOT the 'page-turner' type story that is such a part of the Pitt/Austin series. And, to be honest, I miss the 'cameo' appearances of the author in the Pitt novels."
1,Disaster!,"Can't have been really been written by Cussler. I have read all of his previous books and cannot believe he would publish something this bad with his name on it. Much different pattern for developing a story and plot from his previous books, not just a new set of characters. Even the reader for the audio version is bad in that he over acts when changing characters.If Clive really wrote this we are in trouble when he brings Dirk back if he doesn't go back to his old format. Maybe Clive has really retired. Too bad -- I hope someone can tell him how he is letting his fans down."
1,A big disappointment,"Even though I bought the paperback book at HalfPrice Books for significantly less than its $15 cover price, I still feel like I wasted my money. I have enjoyed all of Cussler's fiction (except the books he wrote ""with"" Paul Kemprecos) but this one is definitely NOT a Cussler book. Tedious, lengthy descriptions, a total lack of character development and weak dialog make this book painful to read. In fact, I put the book down eighty pages from the end -- I just couldn't stand it any more.I guess I'll forgo any more Cussler books until he returns to writing them without ""help"" from other authors."
1,"First Clancy, Now Cussler","I NEVER thought Clive Cussler would have an awful book. But I doubt he wrote this one anyway. His art of switching scenes while keeping interest is not here. This is a hodgepodge of......something. Complicated story. Outright low morals (gee, professional hookers???) were a surprise. I'll pass on future co-authored books."
2,GOLDEN BUDDHA,"I normally enjoy the Cussler books, especially the Dirk Pitt stories. This one, however, is especially contrived and very confusing. There is virtually no character development, so keeping track of the various pieces of the plot is difficult. I felt like I was in the ""fog of war"", seeing hundreds of snippets and just hoping it all came together in the end. Will the real Clive Cussler please come back?"
3,Not Cussler's best,Golden Buddha is good but not Cussler good. It did seem a bit disjointed. I'm not really liking the Corporation (Oregon Files) series.
2,Confusing and overly complex,"This was my first exposure to the Oregon Files, but based on previous Cussler books, I was looking forward to another interesting adventure. At first glance, the book is packed with excitement, good character development and fast paced story. Unfortunately, I found all the different story lines difficult to follow. Maybe I am not used to so many things going on in one chapter, or maybe the writing is truncated and choppy. Despite this, I was able to enjoy the book and look forward to my next Oregon Files adventure."
2,Quick Review,"A super-secret organization called The Corporation has been hired to help return the Dalai Lama to Tibet. In order to do so, they must first steal a large statue (the Golden Buddha) and utilize contents hidden inside long ago to achieve that end.Known primarily for his NUMA/Dirk Pitt novels, this one has Clive Cussler working with Craig Dirgo on a new series with a side character from a previous NUMA story.Another ridiculous but fairly entertaining story from Cussler where the heroes have unlimited ability, finances and connections. If you enjoy his other work, then you will probably enjoy this as well."
3,Golden Buddha - Audio CD,The story is one of Clive Cussler's slower books. The coporation spent more time planning then engaged in action. I didn't enjoy the readers characters as I did the newer CDs.
2,A good idea that should be continued.,"I thought I was reading a Dan Brown book. Plot --> Action Scene--> Cut! No humor. No meaning. My eyes glazed over several times. Even as is, this book is better than most for sale today. However, I prefer his books written without a coauthor. Maybe he's using a new editor..."
2,Marson is On Track,"Why restate what Marson's review so definitively reveals?So, just to add to the mix ...>> This is NOT the classic Cussler as most of us have come to know and appreciate over the years.>> Without any character development and with so many characters, I kept getting totally confused as to who was who. Looking up the character from the list in the front of the book was of no help at all because, without character development, I just could not keep a mental picture of the character as I read.>> The plot was so fast and without any rhyme or reason -- just one action scene after another. It seemed to me throughout the entire book that Cussler was totally AWOL as an author and that someone else who wanted to write a movie screenplay was doing the writing.>> Truly did NOT enjoy this book at all.>> If Cussler continues with co-authors and bad writing, then, like Marson, after reading almost all of his books, I'll have to try to find the next ""real"" Cussler. What a doggone shame!"
2,More mission impossible than Clive Cussler,"This book was a huge disappointment to me. I love Cussler's books, but I'm pretty sure he didn't do much of the writing for this one. Not very much ""action"", nor suspense as, we know the ""good"" guys will win out in this mostly imitation of a ""Mission Impossible"" TV story, though a good imitation. So many characters, the author - mostly Dirgo, I'm sure (whoever he is), that a list of characters had to be added. Also, the story pretty much jumped around a lot, with very short chapters. I think Clive Cussler's name was added so the book would sell. I won't buy any further books by this author (Dirgo)."
1,Terrible,"I am a big Cussler fan, at least I thought I was. Golden Buddha, without mincing words, is terrible. I agree with most of the reviewers that this book lacks any punch at all. As a reader, I didn't care about any of the characters, and I kept waiting for there to be a climax. Most Cussler novels are fairly unbelievable, but this one was just too much. I could suspend my disbelief for that long. There wasn't a single moment in the story where I was concerned about the characters at all. The crew of the Oregon seem to have the ability to do anything they want at anytime. Very bad book, and this is coming from a Cussler and Clancy fan."
1,Boring,"After reading ""Amazonia"" by Rollins, and ""Ice Station"" by Matthew Reilly, this book was very boring, not of the Pitt or Austin action adventures."
3,Hmmmm,See book summary above.It seems to me that Clive Cussler is lending his name to some up and coming authors. Maybe he should have read this again before putting his name on it. This would have made a heck of a good story if it had a little more depth and characterization but it was presented with too many characters who were given too little time. His next solo effort will surely blow this one out of the water.
1,Horribly muddled,"This is one of the most horribly muddled ""thrillers"" I've ever read. By the end, I wasn't sure who was ""winning"" or ""losing,"" nor did I really care. Clive better quit sub-contracting out his writing. He should dump this cast of characters and concentrate on Dirk Pitt."
1,Golden Buda a disappointment,"Clive Cussler is one of my favorite authors. I read anything he writes and anything he endorses. Golden Buda is my first Cussler disappointment. As is typical of Cussler's style, the story is fast paced and richly detailed. The story however is far too predictable and lacks the excitement and raw emotion I have become accustomed to. Portions of the book obviously had Cussler's polished touch, but other sections were substandard. Had I bothered to thumb through the pages before I bought it, the book would have remained in the store. The phrase ""he said"" fails to set the tone of a conversation. Its frequent use in Golden Buda is possibly the second biggest reason for my dissappointment."
1,Why a new series?,"I almost never post reviews, but Clive Cussler is my favorite author and I am so disappointed in Golden Buddha, it's not funny. A friendwho used to write book reviews and still gets review copies gave this to me because he knows I love Cussler. Golden Buddha shouldhave been written as a TV Movie of the Week and Cussler's name taken off of it. I can't believe the so-called 'professional' reviewerssaying this is as good as the Dirk Pitt and Kurt Austin series. Puh-leeze! I am hoping Cussler's newest Dirk Pitt novel, Trojan Odyssey istons better than this, or he's lost a loyal fan."
4,Cusslerfan,"Many people seemed to have missed the boat on this novel. This is a pirate novel set in modern days. The story is your typical Robin Hood (of the Seven Seas) style of adventure. The moral pirate, the scoundrel with a cause, Dirk Pitt without the government to legitimize his exploits. The story is a quick, fun read that captures some of the eariler elements of Clive's first Dirk Pitt novels. My only criticism is the enclusion of too many named characters. I don't need to know what every member of the crew does, save that for further novels. Overall a good read that kept me going, nothing too surprising, but not a let down either."
5,Chussler Does it Again,"One of the Oregon Files, exellent as usual. Action packed. Unable to put down."
1,Terrible and soulless,"I can only think of three or four books which I have begun reading voluntarily and decided to never finish reading (compared to thousands which I happily finished). This is one of them. I was surprised, however, by how many of the reviews on this site agree with my reasons for doing so. There is little that I can say that they have not already. The characters are the flattest I've ever seen in fiction. The story has no soul. Since I haven't finished the story, and since other reviews have gone so much deeper into it than I can or care to, I'll simply end by saying that this is my first experience with Clive Cussler's novels, and it will be my last."
1,Best West Books,"I am greatly disappointed in this order. I wanted a softcover book (size 9 1/4 x 6) and ordered what I assumed was one listed at $14.98(the same price I saw on a friend's copy). I was sent a small paperback(size 6 1/2x4 1/4) rather than what I ordered. This copy had a label on the back over the original price of $7.98. A sticker on the front was for $4.49. I ordered a softcover book and was sent a paperback book at the softcover price.I know that it is ""Let the buyer beware"" but I feel that I was defiiately taken advantage of. To sell a $4.49 book for $14.98 is reallylow.I sent an email to them through Amazon, but got no response, which leads me to the assumption that it was not a mistake on the part of Best West Books.Obviously, I will never buy from them again and urge any potential customers to go elsewhre.The rating should be minus stars!"
2,Cussler flubs finally.,"I've read most of Cussler's works and most of them keep me on the edge of my seat. Not this one. It's got way too many characters to keep up with besides the standard Oregon crew. From some stage after the halfway point, I found myself almost dozing, as it was all predictable. Cussler tried to sew up a story that had a zillion subplots and characters. It was very jerky, to say the least. I was tempted to skip pages, which in itself, tells you something. Cussler didn't develop Cabrillo like he has done in other works. Maybe the problem lies with his partner. It definitely isn't like reading one he did with Jack Du Brul. If this was the first Cussler I read, I'd move on to another author."
1,This stuff sells?,"I was writing stuff like this when I was 14. All his characters are basically the same and make the same dry jokes throughout the book. The real people he uses are not convincing (I can't imagine Valdimir Putin laughing during a negotiation.) The plot manages to avoid being exciting for most of the book because the team always seem to have things under control, and almost nothing goes wrong. Having said that, there are countless plot holes and things that just don't add up. Poorly written and thoroughly disappointing."
1,Horrible Audio Book,"No previous reviewer has commented on the unabridged audio version of this book. With this audio, you not only get a lousy story, but as a bonus you get to hear the story read by a lousy and insulting ""actor."" I can't believe the publisher ever listened to this before it was released. Words spoken by Chinese characters are ""performed"" in the most cartoonish ""Ah So!"" accent you can imagine. It's almost worth looking for a copy in the $3.00 discount stack just to hear how truly awful this book is. I'm trying to plow through to the end of the story, but I fear falling asleep at the wheel. I am not Asian, but I am nonetheless deeply offended by this audiobook performance."
2,"Disjointed, difficult, not worth it",I have read all of cussler's books. I struggled to stay interested with the storyline and characters. The characters were too numerous and you never got any feeling for who they are. There are too many other good cussler novels to purchase.
1,don't bother,"The Golden Buddha by Clive CusslerOver the years I have been reading most of Clive Cussler's adventure stories. They were always very entertaining and some of the descriptions quite beautiful. The stories are at all times fast moving with good development of their often implausible tales. They had a kind of inner truth which an adventure story achieves by good storytelling. Always good fun!If you are a reader of Clive Cussler's books I need to warn you that ""The Golden Buddha"" fails on all counts. There is lots of confusing plot, poorly developed, dialogue is so banal that it is an insult to the reader.Mysterious? The greatest mystery is the question who actually wrote it? Is the name Clive Cussler used only as a brand-name to make a quick buck?Where is Clive Cussler? Does he still write?"
1,Please don't go there anymore mr. Cussler,"I am also a huge fan of mr. Cussler, so I bought this book with great expectations. But like most others I was greatly disappointed. The plot is bad, the story is boring, the characters are more like international terrorist stealing and killing, and for what ? Personal wealth!.Is Craig Dirgo synonymous with Bin Laden ?I had to give 1 stars, it is not possible to give less. Please mr. Cussler don't continue this serie."
1,"I don't know who wrote this, but it was Clive Cussler","I am a huge Cussler fan, but I am terribly disappointed in this book. I am sorry I wasted a gift certificate on it. I don't know who wrote this, but it certainly wasn't Dr. Cussler or Mr. Dirgo. I put it down after 70 pages. I could care less about Juan Cabrilllo and his corporation. It's sad to see someone using Dr. Cussler's name to sell this inferior work. I could see Clive coming up with the characters, but that's about it. I had high hopes for this book; I enjoyed the coauthor's previous works, Seahunters and Seahunters II. I'll go back to the Dirk Pitt series to make sure I get the bad taste out of my head!"
2,Not As Good As Other Cussler Books,"I have reviewed Clive's other books before, so I was looking forward to reading this one. I was sorely disappointed. This book is so riddled with cliches, I groaned with each new one I read. It is definitely not in keeping with Clive's other writings, especially since I could tell from the start that the majority of the book wasn't written by him, but by Dirgo. The only reason this got two stars is because I like Clive and hope his other books live up to the Cussler name. Oh, and Clive, ditch the Oregon Files."
2,Hopefully This Series Will Improve!,"Unlike Cussler's other series, I found this first story of the ""Oregon Files"" slow going at first and rather confusing. There are just too many things going on (no problem, I suppose, for multi-taskers!) and way too many characters to keep track of. Also, there's little to no character development even of ""Mr. Chairman"", Juan Cabrillo. The fact that he and his companions are mercenaries (with a penchant for good deeds that pay well) doesn't compare favorably with the NUMA heroes. However, the plots were intriguing and getting the golden budda out of the country was exciting and more like the roller coaster rides I expect from Mr. Cussler and co-writers. I look forward to the subsequent Oregon Files with high hopes."
3,"A Good Yarn, Unravelling","Mr. Cussler's literary efforts have helped me across the Atlantic and Pacific and Indian Oceans numerous times. They are quick, fun reading stories, with usually some darn good research and writing to boot. Any of Mr. Cussler's books are entertaining. Yes, the topics may seem improbable, but that is what makes good entertainment...Jules Verne and H.G. Wells wrote with the same optimism. My criticism of Golden Buddha is the glaring inconsistencies that a good editor should have caught. For example - in one chapter, the ship Oregon is moored, dockside, Macau Harbor; a chapter later, the Oregon is at anchor; and 5 pages after that, the ship is again moored. It is these type inconsistencies that cause me to rate Golden Buddha less than it should have earned.Mr. Cussler - your legion of fans is deep. We share your enthusiasm and optimism, but when your attention to detail slips, our unbridled support may start to wane."
3,A NEW HIGH SEA'S ADVENTURE FROM THE MASTER...,"Well, Clive Cussler brings a new series to the pages of his devoted readers. The ""Corporation"" a group of characters from the novel FLOOD TIDE. This is the story of a band of characters who work to the highest bidder, selling their skills to individuals and countries who need help. This group was first introduced in Flood Tide, when they helped Dirk Pitt sneak into Hong Kong. Now, they are at it to help out the Dali Lama and Tibet. All in all a great book. The only downside is a very large list of characters to keep up with, although the table in the begining helps. But, still a great Clive Cussler novel for anyone who is currently a fan and anyone looking for a great adventure book."
4,Better Than Critcs Chalk It Up To Be...,"I can tell by the other reviews that this book has been shot down as a failed attempt to capture Cussler's glory of his previous books. If you go at this book like that hoping for the same old, same old then you will be disappointed like the die-hard Dirk Pitt fans have stated. Don't get me wrong, I like the Dirk Pitt series, but this book and the other Oregon File Series have its own unique light.My advice is this: read this book with no expectations and no view points. That way you can judge for yourself. I thought this book was excellent. In my opinion, not only did this book have non-stop action but it lift you hope. It was a great balance of everything. Things were stolen, a country liberated, and everyone had a few laughs along the way.All~in~All two thumbs up=4 stars"
2,Expected more than the same games,"Last reviews have raved about this. Yes, very nice illustrations and clear instructions but in terms of content, sorry, out of the forty five or so games, I already knew about 20. I expected a little more than the games we all know about e.g. leapfrog, twenty questions ! and if they are to be cited, then more variations should be given. For example, skipping has only a couple of examples. Not all games are going to be suitable for your kids either. For example, a lot of games require 4 or more kids, only a few are for the car and these are for older children. Overall, this big book is little on games - certainly not a extensive 'resource' for teachers."
3,Velvet Tiger,"Lissa is a woman of her word. When she said ""I do"" to Kane Marriot, it was with absolute trust. When Kane asks her to betray a trust for the sake of ""their future."" Lissa has to choose between her word and her marrigae."
3,Desiring more Edginess,"Yet another book filled with black & white photos of very pretty - handsome seems inappropriate - young men. These are not traditional studio shots. Almost all are outdoor scenes of late teens/early twenties, mostly white boys looking bored. There is little frontal nudity, however, a few of photos are provacative. These photos appear to lack artistic pretension, instead they come across as very nice snapshots. These photos did not instill any sense of desire. Edginess was totally lacking in the consistant blandness of these photos. Although I enjoyed the book, I felt that it failed to meet the titled aspiration. I expected more."
5,HOWARD ROFFMAM --- A BEAUTIFUL THING,I would not go with out buying anything done by Howard Roffman .. so this is a must to the collection
5,Comprehensive information for the amateur astonomer,"I received this book as a Christmas present from my wife in 1982. I have read this book from cover to cover several times, and it gives the reader an astonishing amount of information about the universe. I have the 1977 edition, and the only regret I have is that Cambridge has not published an updated edition. With the changes that have taken place in astonomy, it still gives the reader an incredible background in cosmology. However, many parts of the book are rather technical. I think it is one of the best books about astonomy that I have ever read!"
2,Disappointing,I thought this book was very long and did not keep my interest even though I am usually interested in natural history. I couldn't stick with it.
5,A fascinating book.,I feel like I am right there with Darwin and he travels around the world collecting specimens never seen before.
3,Harvard Classics Version - Voyage of the Beagle,"In regard to the negative review of this edition citing ""limitedillistrations and no intro etc..."", I am sitting here with theoriginal hardback from the Collier Press 1909. The book has a 1page introductory note and just a couple of maps or sketches.This is more than most writings in the series has. Its a greatset of books dating to my great-grandmother's era and the setwas designed to put the great literature of the world inyour home for an affordable price. I'm happy to find thesevolumes available on Kindle. Maybe I'll finally read some ofthis set that's been in the family for 100 years and fills 5 ftof shelf space for the 51 volumes."
2,A technical disappointment,"The CD version of this book is very easy to use and the search function is wonderful. HOWEVER there is no way to copy text off the screen so you can paste it into other applications. I find this very frustrating and a big disappointment.The CD version of ""The Origin of Species"" suffers from the same problem. Beware."
1,This Kindle edition stinks-- no pictures,"This free Kindle edition stinks-- no pictures. Darwin refers to the illustrations in the text, but they are not there. Get the Kindle Version With Images from Gutenberg.org instead, which otherwise is the same text, right down to the page numbers which are included just as text on their own line (and that's where footnotes are included too.)"
1,Falsity in Advertising,"This so-called ""Illustrated Edition"" contains very few illustrations: a mere handful of small black-and-white graphics. Evidently the book is just a reprint of an earlier edition. It has no introduction and no notes. Darwin, yes; this edition, not so much."
1,"Mix of sci-fi, fantasy and a bit","of romance. I found myself skimming the book frequently, looking for the good parts. I don't like sci-fi, so the 'enhanced' male character, I actually found freaky and scary, not sexy! I had a hard time suspending disbelief at the many off the wall happenings and I feel that the scenes towards the end of the book weren't written to be understood, at all, really. Prior books were good, fun and a must read."
3,Code Name: Boring,"I was really not impressed with this latest installment of the code name: series. While I liked the earlier novels, princess and nanny, baby left a lot to be desired. It was hard to connect with the characters and the psychic dog angle just really didn't seem to be working. Kit and Wolfe were sort of interesting, but it would have been nice if they spent less time arguing and getting injured and more time on character and relationship development. Maybe I missed something, but compared to the last two, I had a really tough time slogging through this novel and the conclusion felt generally unsatisfying. I think that we need Izzy's story, and then to just retire this code-name franchise."
4,"Love, action and Labradors","I have read most of these books for sheer fun, really enjoy them, this one had a couple story lines with the specially trained dogs that made it extra special, since I love that breed. All in all a fun book with some action and steamy sex thrown in. Rob"
3,More Izzie please,This latest book to the series was all right but couldn't compete with the others. At first I thought that Izzy wouldn't appear in this book. I love how he returns in each book. He's a comfortable character that your familiar with. I don't think I'd read the books if he was killed off.Kit O'halloran's childhood hero returns home for a reason he will not elaborate on. He comes in the middle of the night or so she thinks. Attacks a burgurlar and her dogs don't even bark at him.Kit's dogs are her life when Wolfe returns and with danger. Kit only worries for her dogs. Her dogs are unusually smart and are the reason why Wolfe returned home.Kit is used to life on the ranch and was content with it until Wolfe came. Now she thinks her life is a little boring. Her best friend Miki agrees. How far is Kit willing to go to make her life more interesting?
4,Paranormal Thriller,"Code Name: Baby was a new type of paranormal that I enjoyed. Christina introduced mind-altering used by a special group of Navy SEALS who can make you believe you see and feel things that aren't really there. Added to that are special dogs who can work as a team and do amazing feats. Izzy was again a part of the book, after all it wouldn't be a SEALS book without him. Code Name: Baby had it's funny parts with Miki, Kit's friend. For those lovers of the Code Name series, I do recommend this book and look forward to many more."
1,Full of mistakes,"The content of this book is hard to review, per se, since the translation and notation are full of mistakes. On page 215, for example, I have identified four math mistakes:(\exists \beta < \alpha)(dom(x) \in V_\alpha^{(2)}) should be(\exists \beta < \alpha)(dom(x) \in V_\beta^{(2)})x(y)} = 1 should bex(y) = 1}x \in \bar{y} should be\bar{x} \in \bar{y}y(t) \and [t \in x] should bey(t) \and [t = x]Mathematicians depend on precision to get any work done. This book is essentially unusable."
5,Most helpful.,"The 12 Healers part of the book filled me with gratitude and clarity about the genuine ""essence"" of each essence. There was no more need to search for supplementary explanations, they would seem rather redundant and disturbing. The Heal Thyself part - although rather lenghtier than the 12 Healers - speak the real core truth of human life - no matter which century, country, social status we come from.Highly recommendable and impressive.Thank you!"
4,Great value for an interested person.,"Restoring the Tallgrass Prairie is a great ""first"" book for a person interested in praire management/restoration. The book is split into two parts. The first part is a guide to restoration. The second part is a field guide for the identification of prairie grasses, plants etc. I recommend this book because of its content and superior value for this type of book."
2,not thin enough,"Apparently, my laptop 2.5"" ATA HDD is not ""9.5 mm thick or thinner"". It would not interface with this enclosure. I use a Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop. I'm returning this product."
4,Excellent Enclosure!,"Easy to use, and offers very good protection for your hard drive. What more could you want from an enclosure? It keeps the drive safe, somewhat cool, and provides a USB 2.0 connection.Just make sure that you order the right kind for your hard drive! Some models are IDE, and some are SATA, and they're not interchangeable.Personally, I think Macally makes one of the best enclosures out there. Far better than the no-name, off-brand ones you find all over online."
3,Does not look like original.,"Does not look like the original watch shown on the Swiss Legend web site. The seller sent me a replacement watch because the first one got wet in the inside, but it was the same poor quality watch. I think both the first one ordered and the replacement watch are fake.Good service and attention form the seller, but poor quality products."
5,Why I am glad I asked you!,"The desk-organizer we bought from you is so well-designed, that it has,shown us, so..much more, about apartment living, than we had thought-of!"
2,so small,"...Get the bigger version of this deck. the small version is so small. plus it has thick borders, so it's hard to see all the detail in the cards without squinting and getting really close. Annoying. at least for me"
5,Excellent deck,"The Crowley Thoth deck is among the most powerfully symbolic decks that incorporate many fields and practices. This pictoral superiority of this decks over the Waite,and other similar decks makes it a perfect deck for just beyond the beginner and lasts throughout a lifetime. It is a visibly powerful deck and just holding it makes one feel more in touch with there inner energies. Although you can see some of Crowley's sarcasm in the deck, it is a beautiful deck for all purposes."
1,Buyer Beware,"The deck pictured above may not be the one you receive. US Games Inc is resorting to having their Pocket Thoths printed in China instead of Switzerland. The result? The deck looks like a distored bootleg photocopy of the original version: the cards have a yellowish tinge, and are printed on inferior cardstock. The box looks like a small dark blue version of the US Games box for the standard and large size Thoth decks. (with the 2 of disks in the front)"
1,"Printed in Belgium, not Switzerland!!!","The box cover picture shown above is misleading, if not deceptive. I bought this deck from a Marketplace seller because I thought it is the one printed in Switzerland (which has the above box cover) with the much higher quality pictures. But instead, I received the cheap version of this tarot deck printed in Belgium, which has a completely different box cover picture. I wish these sellers were more honest and straight forward about the products they are selling."
2,Not strong enough,"I have a Maine Coon type cat, extremely good natured. He's been given a lion cut by groomers 3 times. I bought these clippers hoping they would perform well enought for the job to be done in 20 minutes, which is about how long it took the last groomer, for whom I held the cat. But these clippers were not as fast or strong. Took an hour to do 2/3s of the cat: and he was severely tried as the clippers would pull the hair. With much oiling and much soothing we got only part of the job done. If you don't want to torture an animal with this type of coat, you'll have to get the premium clippers I suppose. For animals with lighter coats, these clippers might do fine."
4,Nice set of clippers. Kept my bitches cool this summer,"I have two coarse haired rescue dogs. I bought this product because it was not cheap and had a rotary motor. I had gone through two sets of cheapies in two years. THis is a really nice tool. It cut though their course coats like butter and kept them cool this summer.For nails I recommend this: Dremel 750-02 Minimite. It is probably the best 30 bucks I have ever spent and doesn't hurt them like the clippers did.So for the cost of two trips to the groomers, I have my girls taken care of for a long time."
5,-A realistic AND encouraging guide to the acting industry!,"This book is an excellent guide to the common (and uncommonly) asked questions regarding movies, commercials, and other theatrical carreers. It focuses mainly on the ways to get involved in the industry, but doesn't stop there. They go on to share priceless advice, and the scoop on how to keep everything moving once you've made it as an actor. It's detailed enough that a beginner can read it, yet substantial enough for already-known actors to enjoy. Throughout the book, they have painted a clear and realistic view of the industry, while keeping it optomistic and encouraging, not intimidating. Basically, Kelly Kidwell and Ruth Devorin have created an acting book far superior than many out there."
5,The Crystal Cave,"I was pleased with the ""used"" book I received. It was in very good shape. No dustcover, but I didn't expect one on a ""used"" book. The binding was in very good condition, and I received it in a timely manner.Thanks!"
3,not too bad,"We had to read these 4 Merlin books for school. While I was reading the books, I hated them. they really drag on and some parts have nothing to do with the rest of the book. When I finished the series though, I finally realized what a great story it was. I just wish Mary Stewart didnt have to make it drag on so much. All four books could easily have been combined into one."
4,The Human Face on Arthurian Legend,"As an avid fan of Arthurian Legend, this book is exceptional. I remember reading the Crystal Cave in high school. I just now decided to pick it up again and read the entire series. While I love the story of King Arthur, this book intriqued me because it wasn't so much about Arthur as it was about Merlin, who is the true hero of the legend. Stewart was able to give me something real from this legend, a intimate relationship with Merlin. I have often wondered how Merlin came about. As much as I love Arthur, after reading Stewarts rendition of this wonderful story, I must say that Merlin is my heart's desire. To see him portrayed as a powerful man with just the simple gift of ""Sight"", instead of the mystical magician is heart warming. Stewart gave Merlin humanity. While Merlin says he is loveless, I say that he is wrong. He is deeply loved by anyone who has the lovely opportunity of reading this extrodinary book."
5,Excellente,This was my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE book of all times!! I couldn't put it ---- A book of medieval war and romance...
5,Addictive,"A friend shoved this book into my hands, and as it was a hard back with the paper sleeve missing, I had no idea what it was. I opened it a few nights ago and began to read. I was hooked immediately. The writing style is very vivid and I was instantly interested in the characters. Weither you're into the Arthurian legend or not, this is a great book and I can't wait to read the whole series!"
4,Quite interesting,"I found this book to be quite interesting in that it told us what was really ""behind"" the famed and feared Merlin. It has a very vivid description of the different settings which help you to really feel what it was like in the time period which this book was written. Stewart does a great job of drawing you into the story by setting a mysterious tone to the character of merlin. I think that she did a great job widening the Arthurian legend and recommend this book for anyone."
5,Enchanting,"This is the first fantasy book I ever read. My mother gave it to me when I was 10 and told me I would like it and I loved it. I have read the following 6 books. Now, fantasy is my chosen read."
3,Wonderful book but Kindle edition is poorly formatted,"The story of Merlin's formation is told masterfully, almost poetically. I've always found this to be a great story.However, the Kindle edition is exceptionally poorly formatted. The prelude is missing. Where is the Edward Muir poem? And most importantly, where is the map? The map in particular makes the story easier to follow if you don't happen to be well versed in Welsh geography. The justification is so poor that it is difficult to differentiate between paragraphs. I think it is a shame that such an excellent book is so poorly presented."
5,Great book,I read it for an English class in Highschool and still can't forget it.Descriptive and captivating.A must-read classic!!!
5,LOVED IT,This was my ABSOLUTE FAVORITE book of all times!! I couldn't put it down (even though it became lenghty at points). A book of medieval war and romance...
4,Great book for fantasy lovers!!,The Crystal Cave gives you a crisp clear picture of what Merlin's Life really might have been. It describes all of the legends in a reasonable way. It was well written and described
3,It's stupid. it makes no sense. I will never read again!!!,"It's stupid. It was a very boring and mellow book. I hated reading it in school! :( And since I read this, I will never read a book again! The book scared me for life, and so I won't read another book ever in my life again! Love always, your worst fan"
1,clearly not as good as claimed,"the reason why this book got such a good review is as follows. the people who hate this book such as myself, do not often write reviews about books they do not like. try reading the ""Pendragon Cycle"" by Stephen R. Lawhead. it is a much more enjoyable book on arthurian legend."
1,My opinion of Crystal cave,Im sorry i thought this was a horrible book! i was forced to read it for school! i always read what i was s'possed to but its soo confusing and boring that i never did well...sorry if you like trhis book--i really dont though
5,Enthralling re-telling of Arthur legend,"Mary Stewart's series is an enthralling re-creation of what Arthur and Merlin's life must have been. A wonderful read, that gives more of a feel to the life of the characters than almost any other."
5,Wonderful view of Merlin,"Stewart presents the character of Merlin in a human manner. However, he loses none of the mysticism that makes him such a wonderful character in the Arthurian legend. This book is easy and enjoyable to read."
3,More Apes,Again I stress please get the series.It all comes together in the series.....alone it is disjointed and really not worth it.Get it all and enjoy a real experience....oh yes!!!Cheers
5,My Story - such a wonderful story,"I remember Caroline Cossey when I was very young and growing up in England - she was splashed all over the British Newpapers and I remember my parents going on about it. I took one glance at her and she became my inspiration. I am a transsexual successfully living as a woman these days and I've just read Caroline Cossey's first book ""Tula - I am a Woman"" and her follow up book ""My Story"". I was moved to heart wrenching tears. I guess I have a story - but hers is so special. I wish I could someday make contact with her somehow - she is still my inspiration and always will be. I hope life is bringing you the best - as you deserve Caroline. You ARE a woman. [hugs]"
2,!!JACK ONLY!!,Nice jack for the price but no attachments are included. seller needs to either change the picture or specify JACK ONLY!It is a very tough and handy tool though.
4,Another movie to watch over and over,"My 2 year old daughter loves this movie! We bought it for her when we got tired of watching the first Toy Story. The movie itself is pretty good, but Jessi (cowgirl) is very aggrevating!"
5,Best Disney Sequal,"This movie is either just as good as the 1st movie or even better. More characters, More laughs, more TOY STORY MOVIES PLEASE!"
3,Good for Keeping the Kids Attention Bad for Language,"My only complaint about this movie is Woody uses the word ""Stupid."" But it is my fault that I did not read the PG rating prior to letting my 2 year old watch the show. Now he calls people who make him upset ""Stupid!"" Other than that, great show."
5,I love this movie,"I'm pretty sure everyone has watched this movie by now. We wore out the DVD we had so we ended up buying and downloading the movie to my kindle fire. This movie is great for kids, hilarious for adults, and definitely one that will be watched over and over. It's my favorite of all 3 Toy Story movies."
4,Great,Slightly better than the first but not as good as 3.Looks pretty darn good on Blu-ray for 1999.Just get it.
4,Looking for a game console?,"Disney didn't know my membership number from that Xbox 360 deal, so I went a different route and ordered it from Amazon. It is a really good movie that one can watch in loopedframeset, and brings Pixar to great movements of novelty with toys. On DVD this movie goes on many adventures and covers many different themes. The digital voices are taken from famous celebrities such as Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and a host of others.I really enjoyed the movie and am thankful to have bought it."
2,An OK Movie,"This movie was had at best a decent story line and had a few funny scenes here and there.But even the funny scenes were boring and almost lame. Overall, this movie did absolutely nothing for me."
1,Wow!!!,"I bought this movie for my kids last Christmas and now look whats happening? Well let me tell you the story, when i first got this for my two boys, they watched it atleast 2 times a day. Soon, they started believing that toys are really alive. Now, they try to talk to theyre toys, and when the toys dont say anything back, they try to kill them! I have found about 6 toys, totally ripped apart in their rooms, and they are still watching the movie 2 times a day! Its been a year, and theyre at it again! So i suggest, DONT BUY THIS for your kids!"
5,Toy Story 2 Is Better Then the Original!,"I had expected a dull child's cartoon with a meaningless plot and dull characters...wow was I ever wrong! Toy Story 2 is funny, exciting, dramatic, and very entertaining! This time around, Woody is stolen by a greedy toy collector...why? Because it turns out that Woody is a valuable doll from the 1950's when he had his own popular TV show! As Buzz and the rest of the toys frantically try to find a way to rescue Woody, our cow-boy hero meets other toys just like him---Jesse the cow-girl, the Prospector, and Woody's hillarious horse. And all this time Woody starts to wonder if maybe he's found his rightful home...or has he? The animation is tops, the plot is engrossing, and the movie is excellent! If you think an animated feauture is just a bunch of interesting graphics then you're wrong! This is a heart-warming and wonderful family film."
3,Mediocre Story 2,"The visuals are just as amazing this time around as they were in the first movie. Unfortunately, that's this movie's only good point. Since the characters are...toys...it's somewhat difficult to feel any sympathy or other emotions for them during the movie. The character development is, to say the most, weak. The characters feelings, traits, personalities, etc. aren't developed at all through the story. Likewise, there isn't even a clear story line throughout the entire movie. This movie truly deserves only 1 star, but remembering it is a movie for younger children, I am giving it 3."
5,Toys story,I bought this movie and recievied it a couple days later. It was in perfect condition and I am glad to add it to my bideo library. This was also a great price at the time. I compared to other retailers and this was the best deal
5,in perfect condition!,"Buying a used item, I expect it to have some flaws...but this DVD is perfect. I can't wait for my son to receive it."
5,There's a Snake in My Boot,"I like Toy Story and I like Toy Story 2 also. My 3 year old grandson loves Toy Story 2. He has Buzz, Woody and Jessie and brings them over to our house almost every day. The action in the movie keeps him watching and he has his favorites and I have my favorites. (Rex) There is some humor that the little ones don't pick up on but the adults will :) Disney puts out some good movies. Oh, I bought the VHS instead of the dvd because it was a LOT less expensive!"
3,Not better than the original but good,Good but not better than the original Toy Story. My children love Toy Story so it is a nice change from the original...
1,cannot view movie,"item condition sold as "" used -very good""we have played it on 2 DVD players and 1 Blu ray and it freezes in the same spot everytimei would say when you cannot watch the movie that does not constitute "" very good "" condition"
5,Toy Story 2,This is one of those movies my grandson and I have bonded over. We've also worn out the VHS copy that we have so this blu ray dvd was just the ticket. As usual the transfer is great as is the story.I had been told that there would be a slight delay in receiving this item but I was pleasantly surprised when I received it within 2 days of ordering it.
4,Great DVD,My son loves Toy Story and Toy Story 2 was even entertaining enough where I could sit through it and actually enjoy it.
5,My kids like it more than the original,My 2 kids like this more than the original oneToy Storyand that's not to take anything away from that one. This movie makes life easier as a parent. Get it. You won't be disappointed.
4,worth the upgrade to blu-ray!,"wasn't quite sure how much of an upgrade the picture quality would be for blu-ray considering it was one of the ""older"" Pixar films. definitely a BIG jump in quality compared to the DVD. it's almost like watching a different movie altogether!"
5,Good Fun!,"This DVD with accompanying material is a great follow-up to Toy Story 1, and arguably less scary for young children. We have enjoyed watching it many times since receiving it."
4,"Not quite up to the original's standards, but still fun","It's time for Cowboy Camp and Sheriff Woody can't wait. This is the only time where he and Andy get to spend quality time alone together.Then, Andy accidentally rips Woody's arm off at the last minute and he doesn't want to take a broken toy with him. Woody is shelved. By accident, he ends up in the family garage sale and is stolen by Al of Al's Toy Barn.Al reunites Woody with Jessie, the Yodeling Cowgirl, Stinky Pete, the Prospector and his faithful horse. Now that the 'set' of Woody collectibles is complete, they're going to be sold to a children's museum in Japan.Can Buzz Lightyear and the Gang from Andy's room save Woody before it's too late? And, does Woody want to be saved? There's a good time to be had watching and finding out."
4,Toy Story 2,This is a great family film that is easy to watch. My son loves this film so much and will sit and watch it from start to finish which is great for busy Mom's. Happy to recommend this one.
3,A little better....,"The first 3 mns is astonishing in 3D,it's like whaaaaou,but unfortunetly after the 3 mns the 3D become very average and sometime even very flat."
4,Not as good as the original,Toy Story 2 was made in the same fun filled manor as the original Toy Story. The only problem it just did not come up to the same standard as the first.Sometimes you just shouldn't go too far. I watched the first one many times this one I only watched twice. I may not have liked it all that much but I give it 4 stars because my kids loved it almost as much s the first.
5,Toy Story 2,WHEN I ORDERED THIS I WASN'T EXPECTING TO GET IT FOR A COUPLE WEEKS. i GOT THIS WITHIN 4 TO 5 DAYS AFTER ORDERING. THE SELLER IS GREAT!
3,Is it new?,I was under the idea this was to be new and in original case and packaging. That is what I wanted. It came in plain black plastic case and no wrapping.
3,Less is More?,"All I can ask is What Idiot at Pixar Marketing made the decision to exclude the wonderful short Tin Toy from this edition; and Luxo Jr from Toy Story 1??? I have to keep the original DVDs because some Bonehead left out these?? With two discs you'd think Pixar would make sure one got everything from the previous release. Nooo! Otherwise I love these guys, but someone really dropped the ball on this."
3,Missing Luxo Jr.,"Great movie, great package. Unfortunately missing Pixar short 'Luxo Jr.'Once again, Disney does what it can to make a special edition, leave some out that was already there, and make more money off of you. You either have to buy the Pixar shorts DVD or hold onto the old Toy Story 2 DVD just so you have the short....which is a classic."
5,The Godfather 2 of Animated Movies,"The movie itself is one of the best CG animated ever made. The delivery of the product was amazingly fast and brand new, as described. Great seller."
5,my son watches it over and over,my son has seen both toy story 1 and 3 but never two when i showed him this movie he was even more of a toy story fanatic. he was so exsited to see how woody and buzz met jessie. He watches this movie every nightit came in great condition and was well packaged
5,From the kids perspective and mine (a mom),My husband and I enjoy this movie AND my 2.5 year old son and his 3 year old buddy do too! Toy Story 2 holds all our interest!
4,Good for the Kids,"Nothing is as good as the first time, but this one still held their interest ! Grandson loves these guys ! The Papaw"
5,If you have kids you'll end up memorizing lines,"When I first reviewed this I was thinking that I didn't like the second movie as much as the first. Perhaps I was wrong. My two daughters, ages 14 years and 18 months, both love this movie more than any other we own. I have watched it or heard it in the distance dozens of times.A year ago my then 6 month old daughter didn't watch movies, now at a year and a half she is a huge fan of Buzz. She loves Buzz and askes to watch him almost everyday. She has a buzz toy, which is her favorite. Buzz, Buzz, Buzz.I still like the first Toy Story movie a little bit more, but I think both movies deserve a 5 and that any family with young ones should have this set in their collection. They are both good clean fun and enjoyable to watch, even for the umpteenth time."
4,One of my daughters favorites,I bought this for my 3 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it. She knows the characters and can name them all she as watched it so many times.
3,Toy Story 2 DVD,After watching and enjoying the Toy Story we let our 3.5 year old daughter watch the Toy Story 2. We didn't think that it was as good as the original but OK. Our daughter thought there were a few scary parts in it and it doesn't get watched as much as the Toy Story. Still glad we bought it.
5,Best Movie for kids,"My 4 year old son loves Toy Story 2 and rented it every opportunity we had, however that was getting expensive so my search began to find it on DVD. For months I was unable to locate this movie on DVD or VHS and gave up until prior to Christmas. I finally found it on the Amazon.com website as used and purchased it right away. My son loves this movie and will watch every chance he gets. The family also enjoyed the movie and will most likely purchase this movie for their own kids and enjoyment."
5,What a cute movie!,I actually sat down to watch this the other day with my kids and was glued to the tv! What a great movie!
4,"Sweet, Fun Story","Ok, not as good as 1 or 3 but pretty good and another facet to explore in a toy's story. Woody's arm rips off a bit and it becomes apparent that he's getting old. Kidnapped from a rummage sale where he is accidentally placed, Woody ends up with a toy seller and discovers his forgotten history, He is a character from a 1950's TV puppet show. His old compatriots are introduced and they learn that they will be sold to a toy museum in Japan. What is better? Being preserved in a museum in Japan or being Andy's toy? What will Woody and his new friends choose?"
4,A must see if you're watching all the Toy Story movies,"No introduction needed. You might not think it's the best one of the trilogy so far, but it's really good and a must see. Enjoy."
3,"fast delivery, and video perfect condition/not brand new","The video works wonderfully, and it arrived quite quickly. My only problem was that I wanted to give this as a gift, and it said it was ""new."" It was not new and it was not in the original packaging. It seems as though the seller put together the packaging.Not that big of a deal for me because I kept it for my son, and he loves it.Looking for a better description I guess.thank you so much though, and I would buy from you again."
3,Arthurian Quest Review,"While I appreciated having a book that looks at the Arthurian Legends for incorporating them into mysticism, occult, or religious path.I couldn't help but feel this was a disjointed work. But I've enjoyed some of the passages and making use of them or just reading them."
1,Amber Wolfe is ignorant of medieval history.,"Amber Wolfe is ignorant of medieval history. As an historian whose focus is the middle ages, I can state unequivocally that Amber Wolfe is completely ignorant of medieval history. She is so obsessed with discrediting the medieval church that one wonders whether her historical blunders are intentional or not. The book is a complete waste of money."
5,A Profound Study Written with Great Clarity,"This extraordinary book, first published in 1963, deserves to be more widely known. Readers interested in psychoanalysis, developmental psychology, transpersonal psychology, religious experience, practical spiritualities, and studies of mysticism would all find in this wonderful book a coherent, deeply thoughtful, and utterly lucid account of the range of what is possible for human consciousness of what is real and of the stages through which one journeys on the way to ""spiritual illumination and the apprehension of the divine."" Someone should do us all a favor and bring this book back into print!"
2,Actors can't make up for a bad script,"Why is it that when they often have a Spanish actor, his parents, or siblings AREN'T Spanish too? Did they just choose Eli Wallach to be Antonio's dad because they liked him in another film?? NOTHING in this film works, and the actors try to hide that with silly over acting which falls flat at every turn. I expected to see some chemistry between Antonio and Melanie, since this is the movie where they met and fell in love, and yet there was ONE scene that was good, the rest was awful. Maybe the empathy came over dinners commiserating on their choosing this script. Save your money OR go buy 'Miami Rhapsody' instead, it actually IS a comedy."
2,The title's a pun!,"Two Much. Get it? There are two women involved and the screenwriter has used his God-given talents to assimilate this tidbit of information with the common phrase ""too much"" (as in an excess) to arrive at the pun ""Two Much."" I don't mean to mock, but having watched this movie I feel I can rightly surmise that there must be a village out there somewhere missing an idiot because he was responsible for this. The humor has its moments, but is generally predictable and stale. I really can't make any accurate guesses at the intelligence on the scriptwriters, but their density much be such that light can bend around them. This film is cliche, poorly acted, and just plain bad. There are innumerable things that one can do with two hours and I suggest you partake in one of those things. Just please, do not watch this movie."
3,"not too much,just right","Listen, I'll make it my point to agree with one particular reviewer who made a good point.So, this movie isn't particularly intelligent or ""deep"".It's not oscar worthy, and its not gonna offer up any mind blowing performances.It IS however,solid entertainment that'll give you warm fuzzies for the hour and a half it takes up. Just curl up in front of the tv when you have nothing better to do, and watch this film.Sure its lighthearted, but its feel-good, and sometimes thats just what you need."
3,From the back cover - just the facts (plot) -,"Art Dodge (Antonio Banderas) would like to break off his engagement to fiancée Betty (Melanie Griffith), but her mob-boss ex-husband makes it impossible for him to say no to the wedding. Then Art manages to fall in love with Betty's sister (Daryl Hannah) and becomes entangled in an outrageous charade - inventing his own twin brother so he can date both women at once."
1,So-ooo bad!,I love Antonio Banderas and Melanie Griffith. I really looked forward to seeing this movie but I was EXTREMELY disappointed. I tried to watch it 3 times and fell asleep each time. I do NOT recommend this one. SAVE YOUR MONEY.
5,Works for cradle cap,My 3month old son had a stubborn cradle cap which wasn't going away with oil. I wanted to use natural shampoo the other brands had nature in the name but still had parabens. This product is really natural. It did a good job reducing his cradle cap. It also smells very nice.
1,Over priced piece of crap,I bought this sticker as a joke to stick on my friends car. In its defense the sticker is very durable. But it is way over priced.
4,Good stand-alone monologues for teens.,This book has a variety of fairly short monologues for teenaged boys and girls. The subjects range from very serious (child abuse and alcoholism) to very funny. They are fairly well written and up to date. I use them in acting classes that I teach.
2,Bleh!,"Another book of monologues for teenagers which are just ramblings. I'm a high-school actress, and my mother bought me this book. I used one monologue from the men's section, because the women's monolgues, I felt, were just not appropriate for most audition or performance settings. These monologues were not taken from plays, which I prefer, and are very bland and juvenile. To perform these would be an insult to one's ability. There is so much great material out there, and none of it is in this book."
4,Uniquely engineered item.,"You can tell someone put some thought into designing this door stop. Works well tile and linoleum, only a problem if door height is to high."
5,Perfect!,"This is he perfect door stop. I am slightly, and I mean only slight, that someone will pull the door shut, not realizing there is a 'door jam', but it is highly unlikely where I use it.Because we replaced our bedroom flooring with hardwood, the door then swung more freely causing concern if someone got up in the (dark) night. I really didn't want a floor model door stop; it would get in the way, and be somewhat unattractive.This is out of sight and works just as described.We purchased two, one for the guest room which door is kept closed most of the time. However I put a string thru it and hung it on the door know so it is always available.I highly recommend this product."
4,Very good but may damage door,"This is a really good little utility that serves its intended purpose very well. However, on some doors it may damage paint. It would be helpful if it had more of the rubber strips to help alleviate the problem. I use it but put a washcloth between it and the door to protect the door."
5,Awesome!,"Got this door stop for my classroom. My door has a large space at the bottom of the door so a typical/regular door stop doesn't fit. I purchased the larger wedge and it still didn't hold the door open. The door would just swing over it. I purchased another door stop that looked like a comma, which worked for several weeks....then it flattened and started to slide, not keeping the door open. I found this one and saw all the different spots you can place it to keep the door open. I purchased this late August and it still works like it did the first day. My students kick it, step on it, slam it in the door... you name it, they've done it. It hasn't damaged one bit. It also has a small hole on the ""ramp"" part of the wedge and I use it to hang it up to keep it out of the way. I have a small plastic hook right by the door that I hang it on when it's not being used."
4,Good boots kept my feet warm and dry,"These boots work very well for me,I needed a wide boot for my feet.In the most recent snowstorms and afterward my feet were warm and dry in these boots.Good boots for the money."
3,big question,"Well I can see this has been drastically reduced and I would like to buy it, but I don't know if the elephant is removable. If it is, I say buy!"
1,Apricorn drives are CRAP!,"I purchased two apricorn drives, one 500gb, and the other a 250gb. BOTH failed with minimal or NO USE before a year was up. The first one to fail, had all of my photos on it which were unable to be recovered. The second one I didn't have a chance to store anything on it, (thank goodness!) and shortly after the first one failed, which was being used on my home computer, the second one failed, which was being used with my business computer.Apricorn did NOTHING.Will NEVER purchase another Apricorn product!"
3,wowwee elvis,"I am a little disappointed with this item, Elvis's eyes are eery looking and takes away from the realness look. He does sing and talk which is cool, just don't look into his eyes when you are playing him. (I put a pair of Elvis sunglasses on him) The first robot I received did not work at all, but I contacted the company and they sent me a replacement. Overall I am pleased with this item even though it didn't live up to my original expectations."
3,"So-so overall, but not too bad","We bought this odd item to go in an Elvis-themed area of our rec room. The dog was totally creeped out, but the humans in the house have enjoyed it at times, particularly guests. Several songs and a number of trivial facts presented by a pretty good voice double produce an adequately-authentic result. Built-in motion sensors enable 'Elvis' to interact with observers in a way that is initially amusing (though the canned speech is limited and repetitive). As at least one other reviewer mentioned, this guy looks much better wearing a pair of cheap Elvis-style shiny sunglasses. Our machine didn't work well from the get-go: there was some sort of issue with the plastic gears involved in animating the face and head, some of which do not function properly and are very noisy when in operation (think: the laborious sounds of a wind-up toy ALL THE TIME that the robot is turned on). In all this is a fun item, but not so great for frequent use."
1,Unsweetened banana chips,I purchased 2 pkgs of these unsweetened banana chips. I really thought they would be similar to other banana chips that are sweetened. I wanted some with just a little sweetness but not as sweet as what is normally on the market. However - I don't like to say anything bad about anything but these absolutely taste like cardboard - there is absolutely NO taste ( you would never guess you were eating bananas if you were blindfolded) and the texture is like cardboard also. I WOULD NEVER PURCHASE THEM AGAIN. Sorry... wish I could say something positive about these but I can't in all honestly.
1,Unsweetened banana chips,"Bought these as snack to keep in office as snack. They taste like cardboard, with no natural banana taste. I have purchased similar product at my local grocery store and they tasted better! Do not recommend buying!"
2,Turns a healthy banana into an unhealthy snack,"The quick summary is if you want a banana snack, eat a banana. If you want a portable banana snack that will not bruise, get a banana snack like Trader Joe's 'flattened banana' which is nothing but a flattened banana. These banana chips are labeled as 'unsweetened' which makes you think they are healthy, but they have coconut oil which adds a lot of fat calories of questionable quality. I would suggest pure 100% banana for your banana snack. You don't know anything about the quality of the oil which goes into this product or how damaged the oil gets when it is kept at high heat to prepare these chips. Stick with banana only products without added oil."
2,Lack of revision,"It could be a good book, but there are many mistakes, mainly in colours names and camouflage schemes."
3,really small board,"the chess pieces are great, just plan on using a different chess board with it. The board is way too small for the larger pieces."
2,Cheap - save your money,"Paper-thin box, flimsy folding cardboard board, and poorly weighted pieces on a crowded board. Save your money and get something better... this set's only selling point is it's link to Harry Potter -- and it's a tenuous link at best."
4,Can solve small board tipsy pieces,"My grandson loves the pieces, but as other have said, the board is too small and the pieces unstable. My solution is to buy a soft vinyl tournament size board from various internet sites for $.... Also, I will fill bottom of pieces with plaster of paris and glue felt to the bottoms. That makes a top-notch set. Maybe the mfg will wake up and make it right so you don't have to fix it to have a good set."
1,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed by this product. I had expected it to be much nicer and fanicer than the regular chess games. The board is folded into 4ths and does not lie flat. The pieces won't stay in place. Although it has the pieces that Harry Potter uses, you'd be better off to buy a cheap chess set. This is not up to the usual standard of the other Harry Potter products. Mattel didn't put much thought or time into this game."
4,Overpricing!,I am an ongoing customer of Amazon but was very disappointed to see the pricing here at $54.95 and then learn that this product can be purchased NEW at Barnes and Noble for $19.95. Guess where I bought it.
2,not what I thought,I was very disappointed whe I received this yesterday. Very flimsy board.It comes in a very thin box. very small. I cannot believe I just paid $59.00 for this.
4,Harry Potter Wizard Chess,Chess is a wonderful game for all ages. Harry Potter Wizard Chess makes it more fun with pieces depicted in the movie series. What could be better?
2,Not real happy with this.....,"O.K. it's chess - The pieces should have been molded of a heavier plastic, with a base on them - they are hollow. The box is completely cheesy, Really cheap and flimsy - It should have a heavier stock cardboard with a molded insert at the very least to store the game. The board is also a bit too small for the size of the pieces.I like the look of the pieces, but they should be heavier. This game should have been designed to be sold as a real keeper - it was sold like a destined-for-the-trash toy."
3,Disappointed too!,"Although the pieces are patterned after those in the movie, the plain grey and black plastic comes off [inexpensive] and tacky. These are not weighted pieces - the knights are standing on soft flimsy back legs/tail which have been bent/warped to the side from box mounting/packaging so that the knight stands lopsided. Easily falls over. Just plastic [stuff]."
5,Comprehensive and useful,"This book starts with a very readable introduction and gradually leads you in from 'first steps' through to permits, banking, taxes, you name it. It goes as far as getting Portuguese nationality. Like other books, it has 'profiles' of the different regions in the country, but in a good balance with other (and more relevant) information you seek in this kind of book. Information on actually living and working in the country is very practical and the references for further reading are good. As the icing on the cake, the book includes topics like etiquette. This is not the first book I bought but is by far superior to my first attempt. I did not know about this book at the time. I hope others can benefit from my trial and error route and go straight to a good buy."
4,Send in the next patient.,"Digital Underground is the rap group best known for the classic hit ""The Humpty Dance"". This is the CD single of another one of their songs, which was not a hit. Good song, in which Humpty Hump humorously insists he will not get his big nose reduced. There are five versions of the song, which sound pretty similar to each other, for the most part. Here is the complete track listing:1. No Nose Job (Radio Edit)2. No Nose Job (Laid Back NY Bass Mix)3. No Nose Job (The Extra-Bumblebee-Scratch-Bonus-Beatstrumetal Mix)4. No Nose Job (Fat Bass International Mix)5. No Nose Job (Club Mix)"
3,It is just CYBER,"One of the my favorite movie sort is a CyberFunk movie.Actually, I saw the movie at first time in Cyber Movie Event in Korea.At that time, the 'Webmaster' movie has lots of stuff about future cyber world.For example, 'Terabye Security System' and 'Cyber Ego', etc.In my opinion, this is not funny and exciting movie any other famous action orcyber sorts of movie. But,If you really addicted to computer related things,it can be really interesting and exciting movie for you, although the movie is not popular in many people.But, Actually I gave 3 stars for the movie because, the dvd title is dubbed as English Audio. ( This title is Danish film. )It means the point of audio part is really unnatural.Anyway, Please don't expect the movie story with any other movie's story. This is Just Cyber Underground world.Just see what is the cyberworld, If you do that, It'll be so interesting or exciting movie of you. :)"
5,Wow!,"Dear Seller:We really had a great time with this film. It was nicely sent, with fine wrapping materials, love and tender care. What a beautiful story . . . my beloved, my ex-wife was so pleased with it that she re-wrapped it and sent it as a birthday gift for her brother (my ex-brother-in-law) in California, partly because he is looking a lot like Sean Connery with hair. Anyway, thanks so much for a great film and gift.Best wishes,J ""Jay"" Samuel Davis, Alpine, Texas"
3,"No Guts, No Glory","Good premise; well casted; and starts with much promise. Unfortunately, cops out and starts reaching for comfortable and popular Hollywood cliches. Hence, a pretty mediocre film. The last third of the movie craters to conventionality with some silly built-up foil (the mean teacher at the School) getting his just deserts - yawn - it doesn't work and really wasn't necessary except for the ""feel good"" factor that all Hollywood movies feel the viewing masses need to ensure the movie's profitability [no matter how implausible the set-up]. Made worse in that the movie showed no confidence in itself in refusing to allow its characters to be heard in the end; instead relied on sentimental music build-up not permitting the audience to honestly arrive at the intended and desired emotional response. Alas, what it could of been.....Still not entirely wasted rental, provided you do not go into expecting too much."
3,Rent it.,"Good movie, It really reaches for the heart, but comes up a little short. Sean Connery give his usual outstanding performance. I found the story to be lacking substance and cliche. Overall, worth the rental - I wouldn't rate it high in replay value."
2,predictable and cliche,"Despite the talent of its main actors, this movie was nothing but cliche. Every section of the storyline was predictable (e.g. the boy is told not to do something, and he does it), not to mention tacky Hollywood sub-plots (the boy's love interest, the man's sorrowful past, the school wanting the boy for his basketball ability). Half of this movie feels like deja vu, after 'Good Will Hunting'.And it's such a shame, because Rob Brown (the lead actor who wasn't even an actor when he got the part) is so very talented. Let's hope he gets another chance to make a good movie. Thumbs down."
2,"good acting, sub par plot","As you can tell by the first review, this movie has a plot extremely similar to the Karate Kid. I found there were many unneeded scenes, which moved the plot at an extremely slow pace. Jamal develops a friendship with a girl in his class, yet for all we know nothing comes out of this friendship. Forrester obviously has a sort of psychological condition, but we find very little out about this as well. The film is somewhat distanced from the viewer, which does not work well for this film. Great performances by Connery and the actor whom played Jamal, but overall, as Jamal might say: been there, seen that."
2,Long and cliche,Wow....another movie where you expect so much more!!! The story line was a great idea but after the first 20 mins the movie just starts rolling down hill. It becomes predictable and long! I wanted to like the movie but in the end I was sadly disapointed. And the kid that played Jamal NEVER smiled what is up with that?
4,Fun For All,"Gus Van Sant strikes again with this tale of a kid from the South Bronx who turns out to be an ingenious writer. Robert Brown (in his first performance of his acting career) gives us a character to really like. He is just there, doing his thing when he meets someone special. A writer by the name of William Forrester (Sean Connery), who now lives in seclusion, inhabits an apartment near his home. They become friends. Connery helps Jamal (Brown) with his writing while he tells nothing to no one about him. This is one of those movies that do not come around that often and should be watched to see its' true magic. I reccommend this one to all who are in search of a good time."
2,This movie isTERR-ible.,Finding Forrester? It's probably best to leave this one unfound. How could Gus Van Sant go from Good Will Hunting to this? Just awful. Trite and predictable. This story had such potential too but it ends up creating about as much dramatic emotion as a morning dump.
3,whatever,"take Good Will Hunting, make them high schoolers and take out all of the wit, and you pretty much have this movie it's not a bad movie but it just rode the coattails of the other movie don't bother"
3,Multi Region DVD Players,This DVD does not work with multi region DVD players. I just received it and it does not work.
5,"Wonderful Story, Great Production!","A refreshingly honest story about friendship, integrity, learning and growing. The leading actors Connery and Brown are wonderfully believable but so are the supporting actors. Those playing Jamal's family and friends in the Bronx, and those portraying the teachers and students in his new upper crust prep school. It all comes together making it the most heartwarming film I've seen in a long time. A film not to rent but to own and watch again and again."
3,A Good Will Hunting clone,"I was excited about this one because writing is dear to my heart. This one, however, is so much like Good Will Hunting I expected Robin Williams to come charging in at some point to tell Jamal that it was not his fault! Matt Damon makes a cameo - that doesn't help to separate the comparison.It's a formula that works - just not as well the second time around. This one is good for a rental. The extra cheese is included."
2,been there done that!,"EVERYTHING in this movie you've seen before, you just haven't seen Connery/Brown doing them together. The acting's not bad,for that 2, i/o 1 star.If you haven't seen a movie in 15-20 years, this might be a cheap way of catching up, otherwise purchase/watch something interesting... Sesame Street perhaps?"
2,The Old Typewriters Were Cool...,"When you saw reviews for this movie, what did you think? Good movie? Predictable movie? Horrible movie? Whatever you though, you are probably right.I have spoken with lots of people who really loved this film. I thought it contrived, thinly written and not that great, to be honest. The story was nice and it left you with a warm feeling in your stomach, but it was a story we have seen a million times just put into a new setting. (Think Scent of a Woman meets Dead Poets Society.)But like I said, lots of people really liked it. I tend to think it would be more worth a cheap seat viewing or rental price, but if you thought the previews looked good, see this film. I guess."
4,Brilliant,"This is a brilliant movie, I watch it about once a year. The casting is wonderful and just be sure to grab some tissues before watching."
5,Finding Forrester dvd,I have seen the film before and got the dvd as a Christmas gift for my father. The package arrived in plenty of time for the holiday.
4,Finding Forrester DVD,"Sean Connery at his finest. Every time Mr. Connery is paired with a gifted, less well known actor he seems to bring out the best in both of them and Finding Forrester is no exception. F. Murray Abraham is a delightful antagonist filled with hubris and pride. Anna Paquin turns in a sensitive performance as the romantic interest. All in all a satisfying film that will easily withstand repeated watching."
4,Great film and worthy performances!,"After reading the good reviews this film was getting I decided to go see it, and I do enjoy a good Sean Connery film. And I was treated to a delightful and inspiring film! I felt that both actors gave great performances, but still I feel that ""Scent of a Woman"" is superior."
4,Obvious but still entertaining,"Old Scotsman teaches young black kid about writing. Ray Charles could see where this is going, but when you want to feel good about humanity and don't want to think too much, watch this--it entertains."
5,Finding Forrester,This is by far the best movie i have ever seen in my life. There is something about this that i just love. It teaches us a very important less. I'm not going to say what it is because it's going to ruin the entire movie. I love the last 10 min of the movie. If you have a doubt about this movie you shouldn't. Buy it and watch it because you won't regret it once. I know i didn't
5,Excellent drama,"Excellent because this film incorporated excellent character development throughout; also because of the incredible inspiration this plot conveys to youngsters about achieving success without benefit of a wealthy family. Sean Connery is like fine wine...improves greatly with age.Recommend this film highly, especially to teens and those interested in the pursuit of a career as authors or journalists."
4,**** for Anna!,"If jamaal was actually going to teach Sean Connery something he should of mentioned some other poets that were not European. There should have been some comment from his mother about poets of color to create yet another dilemma in his world. Anna Paquin is a fine young lady but, I wish that interest would have developed only slightly more. She was obviously attracted to him for being the new phenomenon at the school as it is in real life.It attempted to do something in this film but it didn't quite finish. I agree with many others that attempts were made but the development of the possibilites did not happen. For somehing with a little drama it is worth watching. Not thrilling but a start. Being smart should not always be how many common European poets one knows but how vast the diversity of thoughts one can pull together to see the beauty that comes from differnt experiences and perspective. Can't give it a 5 because it was Eurocentric(the norm) not culturally diverse(the future)."
2,be honest......,"overall this movie is mediocrethis movie hints at a lot of subtle plot twists that as far as i've flipped through the reviews haven't been noticedthe reason why jamal and anna paquin's relationship fallsis between of coleridge, who appears like a gay sal mineo type, the most interesting character in this movie, a 2 linerand at the end when anna and jamal's love interest falls apart you can hint at the insinuation a realtionship was going to blossom between coledridge and himi wish the screenplay writer was more daring to admit he was doing this and gave more lines to the coledridge type, because he would have added more tension to the movie"
2,A well-mounted disappointment.,"The stars are for Rob Brown's exciting performance as Jamal Wallace, and for the jazz on the soundtrack. This is a well-made movie marred by massive reliance on cliche, and an abundance of plot holes. The biggest plot hole -- why is William Forrester's novel so beloved? We really aren't shown or told, and it seems like the screenwriter is relying on the viewer identifying Forrester's work with The Catcher in the Rye. Also, Forrester's writing lesson is ridiculous. He basically tells Jamal to type anything, and let that stand as a first draft. Forrester's ""advice"" is, of course, a paraphrase of Truman Capote's put-down of Jack Kerouac's method. It's just laughable to have Hollywood enshrine a withering put-down as the model of good writing. The romantic subplot between Jamal and Anna Paquin's character is undernourished and stunted. F. Murray Abraham is OK, but the denouement is a hideous and cliched set piece."
1,A chain of cliches,"The biggest problem with this movie is that it begins with strong momentum, bringing your critical defenses down. Then you are accepting and start to like it a little. Finally, towards the end of the film, you feel foolish, completely taken advantage of, because you realize that it is pure garbage from the start. When will Hollywood stop propagating racial stereotypes?"
1,This is the most boring movie ever.,"If you want to see a good movie that is very similar to this one, see Good Will Hunting. It is along the same lines, only about 100 times better.On to this dreck. This movie was awful. Every movie needs a story. Guess what? This one doesn't. It's 130 minutes of the black guy talking to a pissy Sean Connery, who, by the way should retire because he hasn't been in a good movie since The Rock and wasn't in anything good before that, with the acception of the Bond films. I don't understand the average rating of 4/5 stars on this one-it should be one at the most.So if you have sleep apnea and have trouble sleeping, just put in Finding Forrester-it is gaurunteed you will be knocked out within 20 minutes.And don't be worried about missing a big plot development because THERE AREN'T ANY.So if you want a good, heart-fealt, smart, well-written/acted/directed, try Good Will Hunting over this."
5,A Very Moving Story of Mentorship,"Wow, I haven't felt this emotional at the end of a movie since Dead Poets Society. Sean Connery and Rob Brown combine to deliver a stellar performance. This is truly a touching movie. It forces you to reflect on who helped you to become the person you are as well as makes you wonder how many missed opportunities there have been to meet someone new that could change your life. You have got to see this movie."
5,Opposites Attract,"Sometimes, my girlfriend and I seem to come from opposite ends of the spectrum. This book has helped both of us better understand the opposite sex and the role we play in our relationships. The book provides a humorous spin to all those common gender differences we struggle with.I recommend this book, and I also suggest that you read it with your partner. You'll be able to learn about each other together. Definitely a great help to those relationships that are floundering, or a way to strengthen the bond you share with that special someone."
5,A humorous book that makes sense!,"Finally! The mystery of the male and female mismatch is unveiled! The authors explained why guys and girls think differently, using the analogy of waffles and spaghetti. According to the authors, men always think within a box, and they can only be occupied with a box at a time, unlike women who link their thoughts together like spaghetti. My boyfriend and I resolved some of our prior misunderstands through this book! Now I know his lack of concern for me was because he was preoccupied with another thing, and since he couldn't perform multitasking like me, thus he remained preoccupied with his own issue. It's not because he wanted to, but because he could not help it! This book provides a deeper insight to understanding your partner, and is particularly useful for unmarried Christian couples, offering useful biblical advices. I love this book!"
3,Good but conflicting responses on online dating .,"First part of book was insightful. Unrealistic thoughts on dating from 30 years ago. Conflicting opinions on online dating. Buy it for the way men think, not for dating advice."
5,Every Single person should read,This book tells how men and women are different. It is humorous and true. Great authors. great book. good read.Every woemen I have given this boook to say they love it. GOOD READ
3,Single Men are Like Waffles - Single Women are Like Spaghetti,"Single Men are Like Waffles - Single Women are Like Spaghetti was an overal decent book. I would only give it 3 out of 5 stars though. It is good but if you have watched or read anything like this before most of their points are the same. They mostly talk about how men compartmentalize life and woman interlace everything. I enjoyed how they gave many examples when they were making points, it made the points feel much more personal. I think they are almost right on about guys which is why I would recommend this to girls probably more than guys. I find that most guys already know that our culture is more feminine and is therefore against them. Woman however I find think that men should think like them; be very quick. Women need to learn how men think. They do a great job of talking to single parents and relating to them. Overall, I did enjoy the book and learned from it."
3,NOT AS PICTURED,"Ordered 13 different dried fruits (All 8 oz bags) from Barry Food farms on 4 July 2009:Unsweetened Banana Chips; Dried Blueberries; Dried Cantaloupe; Dried Bing Cherries; Dried Mango Chunks; Dried Pineapple Dices; Dried Strawberries; Zante Currants; Dried Thai Guava; Dried Pear Slices; Dried Persimmon Slices; Dried Kiwi Slices; and Dried Starfruit.I have to give the whole order a rating of 2 stars for several reasons:1) Most were so heavily coated in sugar it was liking eating a sugar cube.2) Very slow delivery.3) No response from vendor on email I sent to them.The dried cantalope was OK, could have been a lot better. Product received was in small chunks not the spears shown in the picture. The sugar coating is the major taste here with just some cantelope coming through. If the product was in spears the sugar coating would not have been as overwhelming."
1,Purely Positively DREADFUL,"This volume was absolute dribble!! The Hardys go to Iceland, walk around there getting into one problem after another with things that have nothing to do with any mystery. This book was about a bunch of dumb things that happened to the brothers. Somebody would have a crisis upon the conclusion of each chapter which was overcome at the start of the following chapter. WOW! Throw out the sleeping pills! For less money you can aquire a copy of The Arctic Patrol Mystery. Guaranteed to make you yawn or your money back. This book is a filler. Buy it to complete your collection - read it once (And wish you hadn't - life is short) and go on to something else. How in heck can ANYONE call this rubbage a mystery story???? This in my opinion was just about the worst book in the canon. Just to clarify - I did not like it."
3,Average,"In ""The Arctic Patrol Mystery"" we follow Frank and Joe Hardy to Iceland in their quest to locate a missing man. What results is the boys being drawn into something much deeper: a desperate mission to foil a plot aimed at jeopardizing the space programme. This was a fairly average instalment in the Hardy Boys' series. Iceland makes for an interesting setting and this book was a lot better than the previous one I read, ""The Mystery of the Aztec Warrior"". It took a lot less effort to finish and I read it straight through in an hour. There is a fair amount of action although The Arctic Patrol lacks the suspense and intrigue of some of the better books in the series. This was one of the first Hardy Boys' mysteries I ever read, and while it isn't the best, it definitely isn't the worst either.*Jenna Ryan*"
1,Worst Book Ever,"This WAS the worst book in the set, close runner up was Aztec Warrior. No plot, no good cliff hangers, weak writing. Don't waste your time reading it. Of the 58 original books volumes #48 & #43 were the 2 worst!!!"
2,Poor Entry in the Hardy Boys Series,"The Arctic Patrol Mystery is a boring story, with a lack of a good plot, very little mystery and weak writing. It's among the worst of the Hardy Boys stories. While the author gives us some interesting info about Iceland, the main story is very thin. Don't bother reading this one."
1,Lack of Thought,"This book was the worst of The original 58 Hardy Boys. It lacked thought and skillful writing. All the suspense was created with potential dangers such as a car crash, a boat crash, someone falling, at the end of each chapter only to be rescued at the start of the next. Big Deal! I could write that. This book lacked an intricate plot that are found in so many of the other books. Very boring, unsuspenseful reading. I love The Hardy Boys Stories and to have a best book, you also need a worst. They cannot all be 5 stars. I rate an average book a 3. In my opinion, this just happens to be the worst book in the set."
3,Lite weight but does the job,I bought two sets of these replacement blades and while they do work and get the job done they are about 1/4 of the thickness of the one that came with my mower. They do bend pretty easy so if you have roots and rocks in your yard that you hit often you may want to look for a heavier blade.
1,Definitely a SuperCROC,"THANK GOD for the Half Price Book store on 76th street. That is where I bought this awful DVD. The best part is that the store had a 20% sale on all items and I found this dreadful movie in the discount DVD section, it was priced at $2, which should have given me the first clue to stay away from it but than they took 20% off that price so I thought that even if it is was bad I would still be somewhat entertained.The Croc scientific ""expert"" said it was virtually indestructible using modern day weapons but this movie was so bad that I didn't even watch to see how the Croc was killed; I'd rather just not know. Without watching the end of this dreadful movie I can now fanaticize it making its way all the way to LA and destroying everything, I'm even thinking of expanding my fantasy to have the stolen eggs hatch and continue up the coast to eat everyone in San Francisco as well.Now THAT would make a good ending."
1,supercroc lacks superaction/visual time,"that and the beginning quick fake digital croc scenes til almost to end of film. it gets a star only cuz of the last few endin mins. when the croc looks really good, its best. thats the only thin i like bout dis fim. lousy movie when it lacks this much visual crocstar action; thats just always been the problem w/ these type films genre i like so much hopin the right producer just keeps usin the star monster more and visual enough correct."
3,He's BIG & HUNGRY and on the way to L.A. !,"SUPERCROC ( theasylum.cc )Starring; Kim Little & Marat Glaser.The best of SC is the title and poster, WOW !The acting is quite good whoever thought of making the bosse's wife the bad-guy was VERY comfortable with his job,LOL.We thought the dialogue made sense and seemed what people would do in a similar situation.Cynthia Rose Hall has a lot of acting skill, Seemed to carry the film along at times.Matthew Blashaw has that Gi-Joe jaw,That fans depend on for their heroes.A missed opportunity is Marat Glaser(Who stole the scenes in 9/11 Commission report) as a government desk jockey,He deserves more to do .The only bitching from me is ""Why"" cut away at violence, Every time,Unless this is basically A Sci-Fi channel Movie Of The Week ,in waiting.<"
1,Very disturbing and too commercial,"I am a Japanese American. I am proud of my heritage. I was extremely offended by the way this book promotes cultural assimilation. Having problems because of your race? Getting called names? Being subjected to racial hate and prejudice? Why just go out and hit a home run and all your problems will be solved. Yeah, right. This book reeks of commercialism, except that Disney does it better."
5,we love this book!!!!!!!!!,"This is a book about a Japanese boy and many other Japanese Americans that are put in camps in the United States while World War II is going on. While their in camp the boy's father decided to build a Baseball field, but the boy complains he is to short to play. Even though the boy is not very good he still decides to play, read the book and you will find a great ending! This is a great book about the cruelty to Japanese Americans during World War II!We really learned a lot from this book , we suggest you read it! ...."
5,An Incredible Childhood Memory...,"My father did his Masters work on the Minidoka Internment Camp in Idaho when I was little and it was difficult for him to answer our questions about his research with our limited understanding. My father bought this book for my sister and I to help explain what he was researching and teach us about a history that most people would rather forget. Not only is this book a touching story, but a must read for parents and their kids. It was an incredible childhood memory for me and I highly recommend this book for families."
5,Baseball Saved US,"Mochizuki, K. (1993). Baseball Saved Us. New York. LEE & LOW BOOKS.The story of ""Shorty"" and his family living at an interment camp during WWII can be used when teaching students about war, especially WWII. Younger students can relate to the character of ""Shorty"" and his struggles with fitting in and the hardships he feels among peers. Older students can debate the equality issues and the effect war has on people concerning race, religion, and nationality. The issues of prejudices are revealed through the eyes of a young Japanese-American boy. This story revolves around baseball, an all American great pastime. Baseball is the answer because the Japanese-American's are American's. The injustices in this book are well written to inform a large audience at many age levels."
1,Crap,"Sorry, but this movie really is crap. It tries to be scary. But it isn't scary. It tries to be funny. It isn't funny. I would not recommend this movie to anyone out there."
1,bad!,this movie is trash with nothing to conceal. the actors is acting very bad. you should see just to have fun. daniel jappur
1,I'm dispointed,"I'm dispointed. ""An American Werewolf in Paris"" didn't make sense. I saw things that didn't add up. But ""An American Werewolf in London"" is very good and my favorite. I like ""An American Werewolf in London"" better than ""An American Werewolf in Paris""."
1,Worst movie I have ever seen,"This is it. The absolute all time cham-peen worst movie I have ever seen. How bad you may ask? There is NOTHING redeeming about this movie. This movie self-destructs on so many levels it makes a critical analysis difficult. I mean it. It's not even ""so stupid it's funny"" like ""Deep Blue Sea"" or ""The Fast and the Furious"". This movie makes ""Beavis & Butthead"" look like ""Citizen Kane"". At the end of the movie I just wanted to cry because I had lost two hours of my life. I wouldn't even recommend anyone watch it to see just how bad it is. It is that bad. You will lose IQ points watching this movie."
2,Entertaining but not very good,"Although it shares some of the same ideas as AWIL it in no way lives up to the first one. It is too long, too predictable and lacks any real story-line. The acting is terrible and dry and the special effects are lame at best. As for a horror movie I can only say they should have rated it PG-13, its definetly a movie for teenagers not adults. If you liked movies like ""Scream"" and ""I know What You Did Last Summer"", you may actually like this movie. I wouldn't reccomend renting it, watch it when it comes out on t.v. I love werewolf movies and have seen practically all of them, this ranks as one of the worst. If want a good werewolf movie watch ""The Howling""(my favorite), ""Bad Moon"" is also quite good although it has some flaws, but the werewolf in it is, for lack of a better word, Awsome. As for AWIP all I can say is, LAME."
2,Disappointing,"I'm a big fan of American Werewolf in London. This remake, not so much. Unlikeable characters (except Julie Delpy), a lousy script, and cheesy CGI effects combined to make this a disappointment. The lead male character was particularly awful."
4,Good,"I thought it was good, but I have never seen the first one(american werewolf in London) I dont see how you guys didnt like it. the acting was a little iffy but still a good movie. thought the fx was good, alittle romance, some comedy, some horror, but whateber"
1,easily one of the worst movies ever made,"well this movie was really really boring. it had its scenes oly about 2 however. the acting is bad, the storyline is horrible, the casting is bad,little or know special effects, not scarry, and rather annoying.dont buy it or rent it stay far away from this hunk of junk"
3,"kinda cheesy,but good",this movie was really funny through the first hour.the last hour was kinda scary.thats why i can see why this movie got 1 and a half stars.the guy blew a bubble with the condom!and the scene where theyre bungee jumping off the eifel tower really freaked me out because im afraid of heights.see this film
3,"Decent story, bad effects","It is unfortunate that the makers of this film chose to save some money on special effects by using computers (and bad ones at that) to generate the images. The story is very compelling and interesting, but the special effects distract from the story. Unlike other werewolf movies such as the orginal American Werewolf in London and The Howling, which used makeup, hair and bladders to create the wolf effects, ""AWIP's"" use of computers creates images that do not fit in the scenes. The lighting is off at times and the textures are shallow. On occasions makeup is used, and when it is, the results are perfect. Overall, this is a film worth seeing, but still disappointing."
1,"Nothing at all, just a terrible flick","I cannot believe that this movie was made. Honestly, if you're gonna do a sequal to An American Werewolf in London, get Rick Baker and John Landis back, not some no-name hacks. Don't even bother with this movie, and don't confuse it with it's far superior prequal, An American Werewolf in London"
3,not better than the original,"nothing can surpass London, but Paris is an ok view. not that scary in my eyes but some of them will make you jump if you dont like horror movies. basically its about Evertt and his pals going to Paris, they go on the Eiffel Tower and he stops Delpy from comitting suicide and then she brings him into the world of the werewolf. some great special effects include when Everett is running threw the cemetary transforming and Bush adds some spark with their song Mouth(remix) and in that music video you see shots of the movie"
3,Good.......but not great.,"I haven't seen the original yet (but I REALLY want to), so maybe that's why I didn't understand every single detail, but I still enjoyed it.......to a certain point (see my title). I saw it last June on Fox, so it was obviously edited, but it still showed some pretty gruesome stuff, like when the werewolf woman makes a drink by putting a steak in a blender. I had expected it to be really scary, but it wasn't. Startlying at some parts, but not horrifying. The plot was sort of weak, and the ending involved a small group of werewolf renegades, and the got pretty silly. But it still has its good moments, like the suspenseful sewer chase scene, and when the werewolf's mother, a rotting corpse, comes in and scares the pants off of the werewolf's boyfriend. Not as good as ""Silver Bullet"", and definitely not as good as ""Wolf""."
2,It entertained me at least...,"The effects are horrible. it's nothing to do with London. Ther werewolves change in a few seconds by comparison to the agonizing and slow transformation in London. The werewolves look almost bald, utterly ridiculous. It wasn't scary, nor that funny. Don't waste your time. Check out London, or mayeb the Howling."
3,Pretty good,"An American tourist falls in love with a French girl that happens to be a werewolf. That's pretty much the plot here. This movies saving grace is the comedy. Although the plot is seriously lacking, this movie offers some pretty good comedy and a lot of fun. The acting also leaves much to be desired. But if you are not worried about those things then this movie may entertain you."
4,What more could you expect?,"What more could you expect? I remember seeing this in theaters when it came out i was about 19 or 20 and went with a date. Cheezy horror movies are best to bring a date to. The soundtrack is cool even by todays standards, I have always been a big fan of werewolf movies and just loved American werewolf in London. This movie i was told is no longer in print and i had been looking for some time to add it to my werewolf collection on DVD, when i saw it i just had to get it and the price was alot cheaper than i expected. Like my title suggest's what more could you expect, this is a great werewolf movie if thats what your in the market for, if you desire great dialog and plot without corny oneliners every 10 mins then this is not a film for you. Again its awesome for what it was intended to be, Lupines Live On!"
4,Not as good as the first,"This is still a good film but the first is better. This had comedy mixed horror like the first but then this one will appeal more to the younger generation as American werewolf in London was very retro 80s. This film also has a happy ending, unlike the first."
2,Pretty Bad Werewolf Flick,"This movie is sequel in name only to the werewolf classic film ""An American Werewolf in London"". The plot is silly. The bad guys are goofy rather than menacing. The ending has to be one of the lamest that I have ever seen for a horror movie. The only things I liked about this movie were the werewolf effects and the delicious Julie Delpy. This movie was made in the 1990s and stands as proof that the decade served as a dry spell for good horror films. Buy at your own risk!!"
2,What The?,"This movie is bad! American Werewolf In London (5 stars) is so much better. This movie was all computer, unlike the original. And what's with the werewolf's? They look like mutated gorillas! This movie totally destroys the legend. It Sux! Wanna see a real werewolf movie? American Werewolf in London!"
2,THIS MOVIE RUINED A GOOD THING!,"This movie is a disgrace to American Werewolf In London. The ""special"" effects in this movie were terrible in a lot of the parts. The Werewolves looked terrible, the acting was worse then bad, the directing was crappy, the writing was annoying and everything else falls apart. the best scene is near the end in the train.....Other then that, I hated it. Go see Werewolf in London, its far far far better then this piece of camp."
1,a very very poor follow up,"this film is awfull, I mean really....... a note to the other reviewers, WATCH THE MOVIE BEFORE PRAISING IT! The worst horror sequel sice the Howling two.go rent the original."
1,worst movie ever made,"This is it. The absolute all time cham-peen worst movie I have ever seen. How bad you may ask? There is NOTHING redeeming about this movie. This movie self-destructs on so many levels it makes a critical analysis difficult. I mean it. It's not even ""so stupid it's funny"" like ""Deep Blue Sea"" or ""The Fast and the Furious"". This movie makes ""Beavis & Butthead"" look like ""Citizen Kane"". At the end of the movie I just wanted to cry because I had lost two hours of my life. I wouldn't even recommend anyone watch it to see just how bad it is. It is that bad. You will lose IQ points watching this movie."
3,They should have used real werewolves!,"I never watched the original movie. So I'm not biased. But I thought this movie was funny and entertaining. However, the CGI werewolves that they made in this movie look really bad. That's why I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4!"
4,Comedic Icing on Whole Wheat Bread,"This seems to be a reproduction of the earlier film (""American Werewolf in London"") but with more comedy, and much more special effects using computer generated images. ""Is it real of is it Memorex?"" Some American students / tourists visit Paris to do something wrong, and tumble into a situation that is over their heads. The hero gets the girl, but also gets more than he bargained for. His attempts to get out of his predicament form the basis for this horror film leavened with comedy. All this action could make you overlook the real danger in foreign travel (contracting a fatal disease). All in all, a fun movie to watch (if you are not too critical).The actions of les loups garous should make ""Buffy"" happy she only has vampires to deal with! Its too bad Abbott & Costello are no longer around to take advantage of today's technology (""Abbot & Costello Meet Jekyll & Hyde"")"
3,Fast Paced; Quirky; Good Date Movie,"Werewolves here are more ""interesting"" looking than scary. This film never approaches the overall quality of 1981's ""An American Werewolf in London"", and yet, it is no waste of time. Rather good chemistry between the two lead characters, although, it is worth noting Tom Everett Scott has had much more career success since this film than Julie Delpy. Lots of romance and just enough intermittent comic relief to make it one of the few horror movies one can watch with a date. Surprisingly conservative for an ""R"" rated DVD, regrettably Julie shows very little skin."
1,An American Werewolf in Paris- Stick to London.,"Remakes are always horrible, and if you want to be scared and entertained stick to the Best, the original, An American Werewolf IN London. Sorry just my opinion. I saw Paris version it's okay,not Great compared to it's original.(London)"
3,Why does everyone hate this movie?,"Okay, it's not the best horror movie, or werewolf movie, or even in the top 25. I agree that the acting isn't that great, hey I agree with most of the negitive points that other reviewers made about it. However, I still like it, and I watch it when it comes on TV. I guess I'm one of those people who can suspend judgement and get into some movies that don't make sense, and I wonder what that really says about me?"
1,i wish i could give negetive stars!!,"this movie really bit it!!no pun intended.i read in a reveiw that the graphic scenes were really bloody.WHAT PART WAS THAT?MAYBE I FELL ASLEEP.either way,this is why 90% of sequals(franchises included!)arent worth the popcorn that i spill in my rush to leave.i dont even understand why it got an ''R'' rating.there should be an ''L'' rating for LAME!!it fails miserably on all counts.when it tried to be funny it depressed me,and when it tried to scare me it put me to sleep,the acting was deplorable,no chemistry,no chills,no reason to watch.PEOPLE,PLEASE,STAY AWAY FROM THIS JUNK AND RENT/BUY PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE!COMPARED TO A.W.I.P,ITS CITIZEN KANE!!YOUVE BEEN WARNED!!"
1,"0 STARS: And this movie really, really, really deserves 0 stars!!","""An American Werewolf in Paris"" is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have ever observed. Don't even try to compare this to the classic ""An American Werewolf in London"". This movie is about as scary as ""The Naked Gun"", the acting is pathetic and the plot for this movie is horrible...I can not even bear to rehash it to you. There is nothing creepy or remotely scary about this movie...it is just plain stupid.Also, the werewolves in this movie look like some kind of a joke. I tried to keep an open mind, but basically, I could barely finish this movie and the best thing about it was when it was over and I did not have to watch anymore. Total waste of time. I mean basically, this movie is a total ""ZERO"" and my recommendation to you is not to even think of wasting your time on this flick."
1,Director's Sophomore outing is not up to snuff,"Anthony Waller took the helm of American Werewolf in Paris on the success of his wildly amazing film ""Mute Witness"". Everything about ""Mute Witness"" was wonderful. It was riveting and an edge-of-your-seat thriller.American Werewolf in Paris is just the opposite. I wanted to like this film, because I was nuts about Waller's first film. Here, however, the director, the producer, or the studio - or all three [messed] this film up horribly. The story-line is pitifully infantile - which Werewolf in London wasn't. Further the CGI werewolves are so badly created that they look not unlike cartoon characters (similar to Roger Rabbit).I hope and pray we get better results from Waller again and that his brilliance isn't just lightning in a bottle.Don't bother!"
4,3.5 stars out of 5 stars,"Good plot. Campy horror and comedy blended together. CGI werewolves sometimes appear too much like ""videogame"" graphics to actually scare viewers. On the flip side there is suspense and there is plenty of violent action to keep viewers on the edge of their seats."
2,Not a sequel just another werewolf movie,"For those that waited all these years for a sequel to the classic American Werewolf in London, the wait is not over.American adventurers looking for thrills across Europe decide to bungy jump from the Eiffel Tower. But there is a beautiful woman who is going to commit suicide by jumping. One of the boys jumps to her rescue. But her secret is she is a werewolf and accidentally infects him.Well, it turns out that there is a pack of werewolves in Paris and they feed on Americans. (Let's talk obvious stereotyping.) While at times it is good (especially when Julie Delpy is on screen).Don't waste your time watch the original!!!"
4,Great companion movie to AWIL (Am Werelf in London),"If you liked American Werewolf In London, you will like this film. It follows the same mythology where the attack survivor is a person by day and wolf by the full moon phases. While in human form, the person sees ghost of all their victims encouring them to end the line of the curse by killing them selves.It has the same quirky humor with the twist of a female anti-hero. The film has some fantastic special effects for its time that predate ccg."
3,Bothersome in its presentation,"The first dozen pages of this book promised one of the best biographies I would likely read, when I was quickly disabused of my expectations. Though Pringle ably exposes Roosevelt's political theories and doctrines and their strange inceptions, the presentation of the book tediously presents a few details, then gives Roosevelt's reaction, then a new set of details, then Roosevelt's reaction, ad infinitum. I realize that histories and biographies are usually chronologically linear, but even though Pringle runs forward or looks back as it suits the situation, the whole presentation seems a tedious catalog of action and reaction."
2,Not as good as you think,"Old movie, made very little sense. The best part of movie was seeing the cars from the 1930s. I had know idea what was going on because of bad directing; fell asleep half way through this monstrosity."
3,Worth Seeing once,"Katharine Hepburn delivers a great performance in this otherwise routine movie. The story is rather trite, and mundane and just when there is hope for a good picture it ends. However the scene where Ms. Hepburn recites Hamlet's soliloquy and then the does the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet is worth seeing even if you must sit through the rest of the movie."
1,One-dimensial...,"First two books of the author are accessible to everyone interested in historical fiction and I enjoyed them immensely. This book, unfortunately, completely failed my expectations. Unless you are a fanatic of theological disputes or a specialist in religious trends, you do not need to spend your money on the book. The previus reviewer has very precisely formulated the thoughts the book evoked in me. The sect seems to be doomed from the start and as they are drawn so one-dimensially, you feel absolutely no pity... One crowd of fanatics less, so History erased them from its pages..."
2,What a disappointment,"This book contains information from 8 quilters. Cheryl Greider- Bradkin, Ami Simms, Helen Kelley, Merikay Waldvogel, Margaret Miller, Marta Amundson, Flavin Glover and Jan Myers-Newbury. We learn to make a seminole sweatshirt, improve your quilting stitch, ribbonwork reverse applique, date quilts, blooming quilt grids, pieced collar with seminole ribbons, log cabin variations, and hand-dyeing fabric. I enjoyed the information on dyeing fabric and was disappointed in the rest. There are quite a few pictures of scenery, the ocean, forest, meadows, mountains. I guess somehow that belongs in a quilting book? There are some nice photo's of old quilts. I won't be making anything from this book but perhaps you will. I don't think it's worth more than a couple dollars."
3,"Good information, but ....","Mr. Prolux is certainly an authority in 32mm cabinet design. If you look for information you should be able to find it somewhere in this book.The main problem is weak structure of the book with boring repetitions of what was said just a couple of pages or paragraphs ago. Good writing should keep you wanting to turn next page all the time, regardless of what the book is about - this one doesn't!Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with information in this book, it's only the amateurish structuring and general style of writing which gets in the way. So content - 4 stars, style, structuring - 2 stars.All in all mediocre 3"
3,expected more,This is one of the few books on Frameless cabinets. I expected more content but the book did not satisfy me.
1,Where have all the Flowers gone - by Pete Seeger,CD was in great shape - but dull in content. I was not impressed wtih his rendition on this CD. BORING.
5,"Pleasant, Soothing and Evocative","On this 2 CD set over two dozen friends and fans of Pete Seeger, famous and accomplished in their own right, sing his songs in their own styles. This gives many of the songs a new, unfamiliar feel, and tends to bring attention to the words rather than just to familiar melodies. (Having said that, Roger McGuinn's ""Bells of Rhymney"" could easily have been Pete Seeger in voice and style.) Together the musicians and songs present a collection of about 150 minutes of wonderful music. I highly recommend it; mine is on repeat."
4,"Quality 'Nam game, but beware of videocard requirements!!!","""Men of Valor"" plays somewhat like a cinematic production and less like a videogame at times. It is a good blend of realism and entertainment. It is rated 17+, so be prepared for lots of swearing, blood, and graphic screams from the wounded. The dialogue and soundtrack for the game is very abundant, requiring 4 CD-ROMs. The aiming system is updated from the Medal Of Honor series, with a very basic sight-aiming option now available. But the aiming feature is still not as realistic as ""Call of Duty"" or ""Brothers In Arms"". Since most weapons in MOV are spray n' pray automatics, the sight-aiming system is mostly a non-issue. One thing not listed on the box requirements is a high-end videocard. If you have an nVidia Geforce MX series videocard, this game will not run properly. Even the latest Geforce4 MX cards won't work."
2,"Probably fine on a console, but not on PC","This game seems to have been written for console platforms with the PC version as an afterthought. The graphics are Playstation-esque even at high resolution and the gameplay is more like console shooters than recent PC games (checkpoints instead of savegames, etc.). Add in severely anemic sound effects, comical character models, jerky gameplay (even on smoking fast machines), confusing missions, and a healthy dose of bugs (I ran one whole mission with my entire squad glued together like something from John Carpenter's The Thing. Hilarious but not much use in a firefight.) and Men of Valor makes for a big waste of money.On the plus side the fire effects and explosions look really good, but save your money and download some screenshots instead."
2,Call of Duty wanna be,"This game sure gives me the feeling of ""been there, done that"" in its gameplay. I am refering to Medal Of Honor and Call of Duty, except those games had a decent game-save feature. Here you have to wait for the game to automatically save itself because you can't. The result is that when you're killed you must replay the same action again and again until you get it right and can proceed. It even has the little compass so you'll know which direction to go, which is only another way of saying that this is a super linear game. It might appear to be a great big jungle for you to explore, but there is really only one way for you to go. This copy-cat game can be fun at times, but the feeling of deja-vu transcends the experience. This game is completely unoriginal and, if you really want to try it, just wait for the price to drop before you get it."
5,For mature players only,I have only played the demo version of this game but it appears to be a top notch FPS war game. I would suggest to the reviewer who was so upset with the content of the game that she check the ERSB ratings before buying any game for a minor child. Some of these games are only for adults who are capable of dealing with the violence and language. There are many other games available for children or adults who are offended by the more realistic war games.
3,Somewhat ok,"Not too good,much rather have another vietnam game. This is not that good.Feels like im doing the same stupid mission over and over again."
2,very goofy DUM AI ....makes killing them enjoying,i really like the yelling in vietcong.....funny stuff gets boring not very hard to beat....i stop playing after i beat 6 levels nothing interesting in this title.
1,I can't play it.,"If this is a good game I'll never know.I bought it, installed it, clicked 'New game' and kicked me to the desktop.I tried a dozen times before giving up. To heck with this."
2,good animation,"I will say this game is more of an animated vietnam movie,its heavily scripted.at certain points yo lose control and the little scenes play out and you cant shoot or move, very iritating.For some reason some of the trees and bots will turn totaly white like a siloette.that could be a video card issue but I understand other people have had this problem.The voilence is good,I realy enjoyed the viet cong women.very intense battle situations but unfortunately this actualy gets old after awhile.I also noticed right off as a military buff and historian,a few mistakes.These guys are marines right ?well they are wearing Army issue flack vests instead of the marine ones and the snipers have M-21's with the ART scope,well thats an Army weopon.Marines usualy used a Bolt action 30.06 REM or something similiar in those days.This is not acurate at all sorry.The playability is decent but not up to par with MEDAL OF HONOR ALLIED ASSAULT."
1,"Beware, does not work on all systems","I bought this game, only to find out that it would not work on our PC. If you do not have a T&L vidoe card, it will not run. BE SURE YOUR VIDEO CARD IS A T&L BEFORE YOU BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!"
2,German Style Alpine,"I had to return this product. The seller understood. It was just way too small for anything. I highly recommend looking twice at the dimensions of this rucksack before purchasing it for books or anything. It is cute, but you might want to go with the bigger version. Thanks:"
5,Great DVD!,I love this DVD great memories of Nora Ephron a must have if you are a Nora Ephron fan nice interviews going back to 1992 to 2010
1,so boring,"i had to read this book for school... it was horrible. I dont think ive ever been so bored in my life. Who cares about lightening rods sticking out of the ground in new mexico? I dont... save yourself the time, money, and boredom... read something else!"
1,Find a way not to buy it.,"If you want a book that asks questions and never answers them, this is your book. I found reading the UCC from beginning to end was more helpful then working through this book."
3,Just So-So,"This video was made for beginners and it met my expectations in that area. However, after the first viewing I would have loved to have less explanations and more doing."
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointed in this video. I bought it because I am a larger person and have doen yoga in the past and thought this would be a good way to get started. I was totally excited, the video arrived and I tried to play it in my DVD player. . .it wouldn't play, so I tried it in our DVD/VHS player, still would not play. I figured there may be something wrong with our players as we do not tend to use them very much. My friend got a new DVD player and I tried the DVD in there. . .yup, it still will not play. It was suggested I try it in my computer. . .figured out the problem. The DVD is very poor quality. The picture is choppy and the voice is full of static. This is too bad, I thought I had found a good program to use at home. . .but don't think I have. Bummer"
3,It's OK...,"I admire the diversity of the students in this video, truly demonstrating that yoga is for everyone. However, I didn't feel that there was much yoga in the video. We may have done one ""down-dog"" the whole time! I was hoping that the instructor would modify traditional yoga poses for obese people, showing us how to move the fat out of the way, or obtain the beneficial effects of twisting even if you have too much girth to do the twist correctly, but that did not happen. Instead, the poses were mostly stretching poses for obese people with not much yoga going on. I'm disappointed in that but pleased to see something, ANYTHING, geared toward yoga for heavyweights."
4,Decent,"I ordered this blanket to go under my daughter's play yard so she wouldn't ruin my carpet. It is a decent size, and covers under her play yard area. The major complaint I have about the product is the colors. It really is much louder than I had thought. Also, in the product description it said it had places for toys to attach, but I didn't see that on my blanket. I will be keeping it though. Also, shipping time was very quick on this product."
1,Wonderful concept - bad construction,"I loved the look of it but the paper was peeling off the letters/numbers and i actually told my daughter-in-law to return it- or put it away - My grandson is 1-1/2 years and doesn't know about being real careful - but even if he did - the paper coating on the puzzle should never have been stuck on in such a shoddy way - In fact it should not have been a ""stick on"" at all - the puzzle should have been solid - with printing part of the actual constructionVery disappointing from a company that touts itself as child friendly - skip this one"
5,a great learning toy,My daughter has played with this puzzle everyday for the last month since she got it. She was able to recognize every letter I wrote down on paper after 2 weeks of using this toy! The puzzle is bright and colorful and the pieces are big for easy handling. I plan on getting all of the other puzzles in this collection!
4,packaging shouldn't matter....,"packaging shouldn't matter, but it was a let down on arrival. item's great, though. baby spots this right away. year old already recites ABC song"
5,"Excellent quality, Very educational","I just bought this for my 15 month old. This is our 3rd Melissa and Doug puzzle. All are great quality. This puzzle has the same exact letter printed on the board beneath the puzzle piece, so it is good for younger children to learn where to put the pieces. The varying color combinations also make it easier for them to match the letter to the correct spot. I love this puzzle and so does my son. We have other cheaper alphabet puzzles, but this one is definitely worth the money. Highly recommended. [...]"
2,Not as nice as other/similar puzzles from Melissa and Doug,"We bought the ""123"" puzzle by Melissa and Doug, and our 18 month old son loved that one, so we figured we'd also get him this ""ABC"" one as well. The craftsmanship on the ""ABC"" puzzle is inferior to that of the ""123"" one. The ABC pieces are only painted on the front side, with the sides and backs being only unfinished wood, whereas on the ""123"" puzzle pieces were painted on front, back and side. Sounds like a little thing, but with the wear and tear little ones give the pieces, it makes a big difference. We've only had the ""ABC"" puzzle out of the box for 5 minutes and small pieces of unfinished wood are already flaking off. Disappointing."
2,Toys that cause ADD,"The title is just me being funny...but seriously!! I have loved every puzzle we have bought by Melissa & Doug...except this one. Though I can understand the thought of making it so colorful being attractive to children, it is eye straining to look at as an adult, let alone a toddler.After you take the letters out it is just a large mass of colors and animal pictures and extremely difficult to see the holes the letters go back into....they kind of just blend in with the mumbled mess of colors and pictures. My son (28 months old) just kind of looked at it and then got up and walked away after trying to fit a couple pieces in spots they didn't fit. And he LOVES these puzzles but it was clear he was as confused as I was trying to look at it.I ended up taking all the pieces out, painting the board all black except for the slots the letters fit into and voila! He loves it! Good puzzle concept...bad graphic decision!"
5,Excellent ABC Learning Tool,"My 2 year old son loves this puzzle. The large pieces are easy to handle, and the colorful pictures keep him entertained. It keeps him engaged and he's very proud once he's completed it."
3,Would be nice if painted,This would be a great puzzle if painted. The to is a thin piece of printed paper glued to the pressed board. It started peeling off immediately. I contacted the company M&D who gave me excellent customer service. The puzzle is nice but not at all sturdy.
3,Poor Construction,"The original construction of this puzzle included paint all around the puzzle piece. Now, it's just a cheap paper laminate on the top; the remainder of the puzzle piece is compressed cardboard. I called Melissa and Doug directly and asked whether they were still making the high quality version of the board, and she said they had discontinued it. They did offer to refund our money or send us an alternative toy, so that was nice. Ultimately, I kept the alphabet puzzle because it's one of the better ones out there. However, I hate how Melissa and Dough cut corners on the new version. Disappointing, and now the pieces are chipping/peeling on the top, which means it looks even worse.Recommendation: Keep an eye out for the better quality version at thrift stores or garage sales. It will hold up better and you'll pay less money."
5,Learning ABCs made FUN,My 2 year old loves the colors and the animals that go along with each letter. I love the durability of this puzzle. Very well made.
4,Good educational puzzle but mediocre quality,"My 2.5 year old daughter loves this puzzle. She's very visual and likes to touch things. This puzzle is definitely helping her to learn the alphabet (better than books in my opinion). However, the quality of the puzzle is not all that great. The colors and designs are peeling off the pieces and the board (and we've only had it for 3-6 months)."
3,Very educational but quality could be better!,"I ordered this for my son who loves puzzles. This is great for learning alphabets and matching pictures.However, the quality is less than what i expected. The images are not painted, rather it is stickers. So the sides have started to wear off abit.I expected a better quality product."
5,Absolutely Fantastic Toy and Learning Tool,"I was very happy when my son received this puzzle as a gift. It's very well-made, and the colors and pictures are very bright and interesting. We have a lot of fun playing with the pieces, not only putting them back in the puzzle but playing other games with them. I've been happy that my young son was able to put the puzzle together sooner than I thought he'd be able to. I've been very happy with the quality of all the Melissa and Doug toys (such as the piano) that we've had. I certainly recommend it for children as young as one or two and any still learning their letters."
2,The Healthy Pc by Carey Holzman,Simply excellent. Wish I had this book when i started out with my first computer several years ago.
5,Great book!,"This book is very well done, easy to understand and has been helpful to me from the first day I received it. This book is great for beginners through computer techs. It packs a lot of GOOD information in a small package. Great Book! I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a healthy, functioning computer both at home and at work.Steven H. SpenceleyController - Clifford Clearwater, LLC"
2,"Warning: Sound not great, highly compressed.","Lots of other great reviews on the content and song selection. But if you are a fan of great sound and concert videos, think twice before purchasing or consider a rental. The audio is highly highly compressed and just doesn't sound that great. I give the show 4 stars and the audio, 0 stars. Will make your super duper home theater sound like TV speakers."
5,Stevie and his band are incredible!,"I ordered this DVD with a bunch of other ""Funk"" related live shows and just recently got to this one this morning. It's probably the best out of the batch which shocked me. There's many reasons I give this 5 stars...Stevie sounds incredible, he has a tighter band than some jazz fusion groups out there right now, and the setlist choices were dynamite on this DVD. The show is over 2 hours long, and he plays a lot of his album ""Hotter Than July"" which I thought was awesome. You can see some stars in the audience dancing throughout the show, and they show an equal amount of screen time for all members of the band. Stevie's daughter Aisha joins him throughout the entire show on backup vocals. I Haven't caught the group in concert yet but I plan to after watching this. 5 STARS, a must have if you are a Stevie Wonder fan or a general R&B/Funk fanatic."
5,Stevie Rocks the House,"This concert DVD is one of the best. Stevie Wonder rarely tours and to see the footage of him live in concert is a must-see. My favorite tracks are Superstition, Isn't she lovely and As. The whole band rocks out in this concert and you will too!"
5,long time waiting,I love my DVD of Stevie Wonder: Live at Last! I played it while having a party at my house and everyone was up dancing just like we were at his show. You cant believe how clear it is. You will forget you are looking at a tv. You just have to have the experiece for yourself. If you love Stevie you will love seeing him almost in person. A must Have!
5,Love It,"I love hearing Stevie Wonder play with such a big band. 3 keyboardists, 3 percussionists, 4 backup singers, 2 guitarists , trumpet, sax and bass. The energy is fantastic and Stevie sounds as good as ever. If I had one complaint it would be that he does a lot of audience participation stuff which is great if you're at the concert, but not as good if you watch it on DVD several times."
4,Best concert ever,"This is the best concert I have ever seen, from the sound to songs you can't go wrong with this one."
2,Stevie - Where Have You Gone?,"After seeing Stevie play live in the early 90s, in what I believe was one of the best concerts I have been to, I bought this DVD with much anticipation. What a disappointment. Talk about the emperor's new clothes. Dull, lifeless with an over focus on love songs (nothing wrong with love songs), but its a concert not a quiet evening in. The energy and the on-your feet response I experienced live is sadly missing and looking at the audience was missing for them to. What promised so much - a real waste of money. Watched it again and it was even worse. Must have been his pension tour so the two stars remain.June 2011 - JUST WATCHED STEVIE'S PERFORMANCE ON RECENT THE HALL OF FAME DVD. HE WAS/IS FABULOUS AND CONFIRMS MY OPINION OF WHAT A DISSERVICE TO STEVIE ""LIVE AT LAST"" DVD WAS"
5,Rock On Steve!!,"A Phenomenal Talent Does It Again...Funny, warm and full of Life, Stevland Morris again reveals the man behind the music. His talent is so out of reach for the performers of this generation its sad. Noone even comes close.Listening to this reminded me what music really is. The music was beautifully arranged and performed, with first rate players and singers.Five Stars!!!!"
5,Stevie wonder,Awesome Stevie wonders voice and talent unmatched by any other male vocals and still going strong we are blessed to have his genius
5,Finally!!!,"This is the best concert DVD I have ever seen. I love it, love it, love it! I felt like I was there. I am recommending that everybody purchase this DVD, you won't be disappointed and it is a must-have for all Stevie Wonder fans."
5,Stevie Wonder: Live At Last,"This was the best and clearest DVD that I have ever Watched. If you want to purchase a gift for someone that loves music, this is the one. The music (songs) were wonderful."
5,This is a REAL live concert dvd !!!!!!!,"Extremely enjoyable!!! What a fantastic band!!! Thank you Stevie & Motown!!! This is perfect for people like me who are physically unable to make the concerts in person due to others standing during most of the concert and blocking the view from those of us who are unable to stand. I wish other R&B;/soul artist would consider doing this.This dvd gives you shots from all angles! Close ups you wouldn't see at the actual concert. I'm thankful that I did see Stevie at least 3 times when I was younger and physically able. Stevie is an artist who gives you your moneys worth! Being from the old school, THERE'S NO LIP-SYNCHING and REAL music!!! Now, with this dvd, I can see and hear him in concert mode as often as I wish! How sweet is that???"
5,"STEVIE, better than ever.","To use the vanacular of the internet OMG. By far one of the better concerts I've seen. Yes I expected Mr Wonder to sing all of his hits, but he did them in a style and fashion that put this concert over the top. I didn't realize or should I say didn't remember just how many hits Stevie has had over the years. This outting was joyful, soulful, and just a plain delight to behold. I can't say enough on just how WONDERful this was. Over two hours of pure entertainment. It was well worth the price of admission and will be a great addition to any collectors collection."
5,Steveland Morris aka Stevie Wonder is the brightess star on the Planet,"I've been a fan since fingertips. And I have to say how can you not love I mean absolutey love Stevie Wonder. I saw this concert when it came to Mountain View,California last summer. He had everyone singing along with him and dancing in their seats to his many, many hits. This dvd captures that and much, much more. I defy you to buy this dvd and not find yourself dancing and singing along to the music. At 12 years old he was considered a musical genius that was just the tip of the iceberg. He's still going strong and I see no end in sight. This dvd is a real bargan as a matter of fact I would say it's the dealof the century and if you're a fan like I am you better snatch it up before it disappears"
3,OK,"Lively performance by the group and the quality of the DVD sound and audio is good, but... I agree w/ others in the ""way too much sing along"". Also, Stevie delves too much in the obscure and sings shortened versions of the hits I wanted to hear. Would not buy it again and not likely to watch for several years."
3,Not bad,"As B movies go this isn't too bad. It's flawed in places and a little slow at times, but the style and acting are generally pretty decent. Chad McQueen puts in one of his better performances, and there a few famous faces in here too. Worth watching but it's not quite as great as it could have been."
2,Richard's slippers and pipe album,"I'll be brief..... For those expecting the sweeping majesty of 'Bittersweet Symphony' or the interstellar starshooting of 'A Storm in Heaven' beware Richard is happy.This may be good news for him, but spells disaster for the rest of us. 'Alone with everybody' is an album that makes Richard Clayderman sound like Napalm Death. Harsh but fair. Avoid."
2,Great singers w/o great guitartists dot dot dot,"Poor Richard, a super talented singer from a superior band--The Verve: he's still ""talented"" just not great. One great song--Crazy World--lots of posturing. Massive, wonderful voice; mediocre lyrics. Singer leaves The Band. too bad."
2,"Dull melodies, insipid lyrics and self-indulgent all-around.","To all you fellow fans of the three strong albums released by The Verve: what are you hearing in Richard Ashcroft's first solo album that I'm not? After about five listenings, not one song sticks out (maybe ""New York,"" which sort of reminds me of the U2 song of the same title), and the entire album leaves me cold. Almost every song goes on too long, and Ashcroft seemingly has forgotten how to write a rousing chorus, ala ""Weeping Willow"" or ""Lucky Man."" The absence of Verve guitarist extraordinaire, Nick McCabe, is especially missed.Normally I review every album by a particular band in order of release, and, if you're interested, I reviewed the three Verve albums, awarding each four or five stars. However, even though people say that Ashcroft's second solo effort is better than his first, after spending too much time with ""Alone With Everybody,"" there are just so many other albums I'd rather buy."
4,Mostly Ignored,"Upon first listen of this album I was very very happy. For those who cry that this is not as great as previous Verve albums there is a fine reason for that. This is not the Verve. This is Richard Ashcroft, solo, on his own. Thus it should be treated for what it is. Compare it with a copy of the Urban Hymns Demos that was basically just Ashcroft and a guitar or piano. Just as good. This album is terrifically underrated and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is it's sometimes easy to forget about. Once you dig it out and listen to it again, you remember again."
5,Magnificent & Eloquent,"Kudos to Richard Ashcroft. I have now been listening to ""Alone With Everybody"" for almost 3 years now and have concluded that it is definitely a keeper. A musical tapestry punctuated at times with haunting vocals and lush orchestral strings. This in turn complimented with a romantic inspired lyrical narrative bathed in a country-esque aura, 'AWE' does not disappoint. Stand outs are the effervescent pop-infectious ""C'mon People(We're Making It Now)"", the contemplative & winsome ""On A Beach"", the elegiac & reflective ""Brave New World"", and the plaintive nuanced ""You On My Mind In My Sleep"". A most refreshing and eclectic collection of songs to be found anywhere."
5,"5 STARS! C'mon people, buy this CD!","Buy this CD! You won't regret it. After seeing the video for ""C'mon People (We're Making it Now)"" on M2 I knew I had to have this album. I mean, that's a great song, and I don't ever hear Richard Ashcroft on the radio. Thank you, M2!! My personal favorite tracks on this CD are the aforementioned tune, as well as ""A Song for the Lovers"" and ""I Get My Beat,"" but there are NO bad songs on this album. It's just a matter of some being better than others-but they're all very good. I bought this CD a few days ago and can't get enough of it-it's a must-have for any music lover. Enjoy!"
3,Somewhat Lame Sentimentality,"This is a pretty decent CD but lacking in what I believe Ashcroft was so earnestly trying to convey: soulfullness. Great - the guy's in love - so what? If the most he can say about it is ""you're on my mind when I sleep"" and ""I hope to see you on the other side"" (among other similarly sappy or obtuse sentiments), then instead of the depth of his soul we get shallow sentimentality - which is OK - on low volume while you fold your wash. Mind you - this CD has a lot of redeeming qualities: great vocals and harmonies, symphonic touches and cool sound effects (a la ""Bitterweet Symphony""). And the music is, for the most part agreeably warm-hearted. I can understand why there are so many favorable reviews. I just don't find ""Alone with Everybody"" all that memorable or, for that matter, inspired. Who knows. Maybe this music will grow on me with time (like a fungus)."
3,Richard finds a little peace in this crazy world,"Modest showing from the former frontman of The Verve. On Urban Hymns the emotion and life Ashcroft injected in the songs will see them endure as timeless classics. On his first solo cd, he travels the more accessible route of lovely and grand songs which were no doubt inspired by his wife and young child. 'A Song For The Lovers' is a rambling string-soaked number that couldn't be more different to 'The Drugs Don't Work.' Then again, that's just an hint to those who loved Urban Hymns that they shouldn't get worked up in a lather over why this album fails to meet their expectations. But this cd is as close to a follow up to Urban Hymns as were going to get. The music is lush and full-scale, with maybe a slight touch of over-production. In an album filled with gems 'Crazy World' and 'C'Mon People' are two shining lights. In all, this debut album promises plenty."
4,Surprising,"In all honesty, I was really expecting to be let down by this record. It's not the Verve but it's not far from it. Those expecting the trippy, ethereal aura cast by past Verve offerings will be slightly disappointed. There's more focus on the melodies and actual song as opposed to the typically more mood focused sounds of Verve records. ""Brave New World"" is by far the standout track. It's one of those songs that doesn't exactly strike you immediately but after a few listenings, you find yourself hitting the back button of your cd player just to hear it ""one more time."" ""You on My Mind in my Sleep"" is another that fits that description. Above all, you can't expect to listen to this record and instantly be blown away. There is no ""Bittersweet Symphony"" or ""On Your Own."" Let this one spin in constant rotation for a few weeks before you immediately right it off, ok?"
4,Making It Now,"This, the first solo album from the genius behind the Verve, is instantly a more personal and more anticipated album than you are likely find anywhere in today's market.Its general theme is very mellow, focusing on Ashcrofts relationship with his new wife. It's very heartfelt and the opener 'Song For The Lovers' says alot, lyrically, about the theme of the album. Musically there are about 4 upbeat songs - all the singles (the aforementioned track plus 'Money To Burn' and 'C'mon People (We're Making It Now)') stand out as does 'New York'.For anyone who's had a serious relationship in their lives, this album will mean much more to them than to those who have merely bought the album for the music, or out of sheer interest. There is something on here for everyone though and the meaningful lyrics make this a fantastic debut album form an extremely talented artist.There is enough on the album to justify a purchase...and then some."
2,THIS ALBUM SUCKS.....I USED IT TO CURE MY INSOMNIA,"Ok when i bought this mess when it came out i cried myself to sleep for like a month. What the hell was this man smoking when he wrote these tunes??? Every single song is basically a snooze fest whining about love, his wife, then more love, then his wife. The only song I can even stand is NEW YORK probably cause it's somewhat similar to The Verve's material. I have been a fan of Mad Rich since 1994 and I enjoy ballads(ON your Own,History,etc), but every song on here is like 10 minutes of prissy, over produced, cheesy elevator music for the musically impaired. Buy this ""work of art"" only if you are a die hard Ashcroft fan, or you need a cure for insomnia.See you in the next one"
2,Needs Guitars.,BORING BORING BORING.Solo aritsts are never a good idea.I think The verve need to make one last album.
4,NOT SO BITTERSWEET SYMPHONY,"This is a great cd for adults who are looking for mature love songs. You won't hear any ""girl, i love"" homogenized lyrics. The songwriting is intelligent, thoughtful and addictive. Ashcroft has a wonderfully textured and interesting voice. I found the Verve's music kinda angst filled but, Ashcroft sings songs of a grown man experiencing adult love."
4,Its not all that bad.,"You know the last songs kinda sound like country western with the slide guitar and all. But I saw him in concert about 9 months ago in L.A. and I was really blown away by Ashcroft. He was pretty much solo the whole concert and carried on like the typical minor rock star he is. He was even funny. He started into Bitter Sweet Symphony with his acoustic guitar and some people started cheering then he cut off the intro and said ""Ahhh F-ck that Bullsh-t!"" He must still be upset with Nick MaCabe. All in all its a good album. As a Verve fan get it. If you're not a Verve fan then get ""Storm in Heaven"" by them and start from there. The Verve will begin a new chapter in your life. One that you will use to look back on your past and remember the emotions of pleasure and pain that you experienced while listening to them..."
2,Nick McCabe gets the last laugh.,"This isn't a bad album, I wanted to give 2.5 stars. A Song for Lovers is a good opening track. The real gems are Brave New World, and On A Beach. They seemed to be influence by Nick McCabe. New York sounds cool, in A Northern Soul way, but too many cliches, and no Nick McCabe. The two other singles released are both pretty terrible, and pedal steel guitar isn't cool. The 2nd track is cool, but it sounds like they used Zelda video game music in the beginning. The rest of the tracks range from mediocre to okay. The lyrics are a step down from Urban Hymns and A Northern Soul, and the sound took about 5 steps down from A Storm in Heaven and the Verve EP."
5,Don't pass this one up!,"If you loved Richard Ashcroft as part of The Verve....you will really love him on his own! His voice is soothing, and the songs....well, just BUY IT and enjoy! And ladies, check out the CD cover, this man has the most beautiful mouth you'll ever see!"
4,A solo soul.,"While this first solo album from Richard Ashcroft may not better any Verve albums, any fan of that band should easily enjoy this. It's what I would call almost as good. The majority of these tracks should please Verve fans who enjoy songs such as ""History"" or ""The Drugs Don't Work"". ""A Song For The Lovers"" is wonderful, catchy, and emotional, ""New York"" sounds like a leftover from ""Urban Hymns"", and the last half of the album gets even better. ""On A Beach"", ""Slow Was My Heart"", and ""C'mon People (we're making it now)"" are all great. By the time you hear ""Everybody"", you're moved and smiling at how much you liked the whole disc. ""Alone With Everybody"" is as good as I hoped it would be."
4,Very Solid Solo Debut,"This is a very solid CD from the former lead singer of The Verve. If you liked their last CD, you'll really enjoy this."
3,Richard Falls in Looooove,"This album is quite good, especially if you are a fan of The Verve's Urban Hymns. Most of these songs are romantic paens to his new wife and baby, along the lines of ""Sonnet"" or ""Space and Time"" from the last Verve album. But sadly, Richard really suffers from the absence of Nick McCabe's guitars, they added an edge to his delicate lyrics that made for an interesting combination. Overall, a pretty good first solo album."
4,"Good book, annoying ebook","Multiple typos, presumably from poor scanning, make this an occasionally frustrating read. Unfair to a great nonfiction writer. Go for the hard copy. Amazon should do better than to offer a product as poorly presented as this."
4,Makes me glad the cold war is over,"As in many of his books,John McPhee and his capacious memory and notebook spend time with interesting people--in this case a man who begins his career designing nuclear weapons at the start of the cold war. Also like others of his books, our intest is captured as much by the personalities as the subject. Besides meeting a fascinating and hightly idiosyncractic physicist, I learned enough nuclear physics from this little book to really liven up my 9th grade physics classes. I gave 4 stars because the book is necessarily dated, but I'm awfully glad we are a step or two further from the brink than some experts at the time expected, since we did not go down the road to using plutonium in nuclear reactors. On the other hand, the threat of terrorism is greater than it seemed then."
3,World Trade Center First Discussed as a Terrorist Target!,"Perhaps the spookiest ""prediction"" of McPhee's book is the discussion about how to flatten the twin towers of New York's World Trade Center (WTC) with a small atomic device. This is the first reference, fact or fiction--as far as I can find--that mentions the two 110-story towers as a possible terrorist target. Ironic, eh? All the more ironic, because all it took were two suicide jets to do the job--no atomic explosive needed. But you can't help but wonder if the terrorists of Sept. 11, 2001 (and the first WTC bombing planners) were inspired by this book. In which case, the author must be haunted by the fact that he may have started a ""chain reaction"" of idea events which led to a prophesy fullfilled?"
5,the Space Cossacks RULE!,"This instro/surf disc is the wave of the future! Now that ""Swing"" has become ""popular"" (again) who is to reason why the ""next big thing"" won't be instro/surf music! Along with Jon and the Nightriders (LA), Los Straightjackets (Nashville), Satan's Pilgrims (Seattle), the Mermen (SF) and numerous other bands, from all over the world, the future of rock and roll is in fine hands!"
5,AWSOME,"Well if you dig the extraterrestrial sound of MAN OR ASTRO-MAN?, but want something more surf based then this is the perfect band to try out. ""Third Star To The Left"" is an awsome cover they make it their own, you will feel like your on a space cruise with ""Red Sunrise"", ""Solaris Stomp"" has a great rhythm, ""The Cossack"" is a battle for the universe, ""The Spy Satellite"" well just imagine being alone in space, ""Bombora"" is a good Alantics cover, and ""The Space Victory Theme"" is the middle east meets space surf! All I can say is AWSOME band, and check out TSAR WARS too!"
4,"A Good band, a good album!","I may or may not get feedback from this, because of what I will eventually say here. I'm pretty much a fan of Los Straitjackets, Laika & The Cosmonauts, Man or Astro Man, Dick Dale, and the Ventures, and The Space Cossacks are a welcome addition. I have several albums from all the previous listed bands (if not all of them from each band). I do not own Tsar Wars yet, and perhaps that is why my opinion MIGHT be ill formed. The Space Cossacks are a good TIGHT band. Alot of stuff I read seems to claim them as groundbreaking. I'm not quite there yet (Again, haven't heard their other album) but they have alot of good material and musician ship. They resemble Man or Astroman without the kitcsh/quirkiness or Laika/Cosmonauts without the weird foreign thing going on. Again this is not a bad thing. Good solid band; hardly groundbreaking though."
1,reviews from Italia,"this disc for me was too ""hollywood"" - i am Alto from Italia and this is costly for me to buy these disc from the states but its the better way so i don't like to be disappoint - but i was - its too hollywood like the ""rock"" and it don't sound like I expect - I cannot return this which i am upset about. I like some tunes but it ruin it for me for them to sound too ""hollywood"" - good luck! Alto from Italia"
1,received broken,i received it broken and they would not send me a working one - this is the 3rd led belt buckle that has broken on me in a very short time
4,Lots of fun,"I got this buckle yesterday and have already had $100 worth of fun. Once you get the hang of programming it, and it takes a little work to figure it out, you can change the message in a couple of minutes. The buckle is a bit too wide for everyday use but then who would really want to use it all the time?"
2,you get what you pay for,"I bought this belt because it was cheap and looked cool. I got what I paid for because while the LED does light up (which looks cool on first glance), closer inspection shows that some of the LEDs never turn off and are of poor quality. The end result is a bright LED belt that can't be read very well."
5,"Long Lasting, Great Investment!","I bought this printer 10 years ago, and it still works great! If you're looking for a basic printer (color and black & white), I definitely recommend this one. I've tried the fancy all-in-one scanner/copier/printers, but they never lasted more than a year. But my HP Deskjet 960C still works great!The printer cartridges are a little pricey, but they all are. However, look at the size of the print cartridge when you compare them - a 2-pack HP 78/45 (coler/bw) cartridge set costs me $66 at Wal-Mart, but contains quite a bit more ink than a 2-pack of Canon cartridges that cost only $50.This printer is a good value that will last a long time."
5,Great Album!,"I love the sound of this album. It's instruments are great, and the song writing is superb. Get it! Also check out songsfromarandomhouse.com!"
4,Audio Book,"Not quite what I expected. Tolkien reads a great many of the poems and verses that is in the Lord of the Rings and some excerpts from the book. One reason why not more of the book is not read as it was just being published when these recordings were being made. May be they wanted folks to read the book. This is also very good for those who like to explore the background of his imagination, the history of Middle Earth."
4,Awesome to hear the author read his own writing!,"This is a great 4 cassette audio book, with the author himself reading excerpts from The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars and not 5 stars, is because the original recording was not done professionally (it was recorded by the author in the summer of 1952), and it is choppy in places. But, to hear the author make the ""gollum"" noise in his throat is well worth the modest cost of this Audio Collection. He reads poetry and sings elvish songs -- it's pretty cool! There's nothing like hearing the nuances and voice modulation and intonation of the author as he reads his own writing as it was meant to be read."
5,Dr Michelle shares her wisdom!,A fantastic reference! Clear and beautifully written... this is the best book on the subject I've read so far... It's almost like having Dr. Michelle as your personal coach! What could be better than that?
2,just didn't do it for me,"I wouldn't recommend this book as it didn't seem to give me more information than I already got from other books/DVDs, etc."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,The bottle that I received only lasted for a few times before the bottom crackedand started leaking. I too had a problem with sports top on it being hard to open.Don't try using your teeth or you'll be heading to the Dentist office for repairs..I didn't waste my time shipping it back because Amazon's policy seems to be that theymay charge up to $3.95 for shipping of returns so I didn't see the point.
2,"I haven't had this 6 months, and it broke","I bought this less than 6 months ago, and it appears to be leaking. To be fair, I bring this everywhere, but it would be great if it was more durable. Also, this is probably the third one I have bought in my lifetime. I clearly keep forgetting, but this happened with the other ones I bought too. After a lot of use they getting little cracks and leak. Bummer. Wish I could find something this big that was more durable."
2,"came damaged, then broke soon after","pros: great size with convienient handle for my hand size. I can carry it wherever.cons: it came damaged, a dent towards the top. it broke about 10 days ago, cracked right where the dent was.other thoughts: if i get a new bottle i will be thicker than this one, this was very flimsy."
2,Too brittle - breaks easily when full,"This bottle looked good and we were quite happy with it as my daughter's ""soccer-practice water-bottle"" for about 2 weeks until her coach (yeah, not gonna blame him) tossed it a few feet behind her while sending her out to the field.It was mostly full and no doubt that's what caused it to crack wide open like an egg. No arguing it's not designed to be tossed at all (which is why we didn't request a refund/replacement and sucked it up replacing it with a re-purposed Gatorade bottle) and it's probably sturdy enough for you to take to Pilates, but just know it is somewhat brittle and breaks pretty easily when mostly full. For ""eight male deer"" or what-not when you read this, personally I'd pass and pick up something else."
1,Sprung a leak after two uses.,After two uses the bottle sprung a leak the size of a pencil tip that resulted in a pretty annoying leak. The design looks nice but based off of my use of less than a day I would have to say I am pretty disappointed. I would return it but for an $8 product it isn't worth the hassle.
1,cheap plastic,At first i really loved this water bottle. However on my third use of it I gave it a little squeeze and the plastic dented in about a fourth of an inch creating a hole and rendering the product useless. What a waste of money! The plastic used to make the jug is incompatible with the function its supposed to serve; when you have a squeeze sports top you need to be able to apply slight pressure on the bottle to get liquid out! For the price its a complete rip-off.
1,#7 in recycling triangle,I purchased this being uninformed about leeching. The bottle is made out of the precise type of plastic that is supposed to leech when heated and reused. At the bottom of the jug it says #7. Do your research carefully before choosing your water bottle.
1,Cracked. Cheap Plastic. I prefer to re-use a 2 liter soda bottle.,"Really cheap, fragile plastic, it cracked during first use. Also, look at how many other reviews for this bottle include ""leak"", ""break"" or ""crack"".I now just re-fill an old 2 liter soda bottle, which is amazingly unbreakable plastic and 1/4 the cost."
4,Good bottle.,Love this bottle. my only beef is 1 of the bottles i ordered was dented. other than that i love them. easy to hold and use.
4,It's a giant water bottle,"I purchased one of these after seeing my coworker with one.It looks goofy because it is too big, but this is really all you need in a day.No more 3 to 6 water bottles, but one giant one you keep!"
4,Great Bottles Despits Some Design Flaws!,"I bought seven of these and have been using them for a few months. I refill them every Saturday with purified water and I drink one per day throughout the week, giving me the ""8 glasses of water per day"" I need. I love these things! For years I drank bottled water, and had to drag home bottles of water ever week from the super market, but now I use these! One thing is worth mentioning...The caps are twist-off, but have pull-out squirters built in. Unfortunately, this feature is worthless. It is nearly impossible to use the squirt feature because pliers are necessary in order to get the darned stubborn squirt tops to pop out. I can bench press 200lbs and I can't get the squirt top open with my bare hands. I just ignore this feature and twist the entire top off when I want to drink.Luckily, I am un-phased by this design flaw, but its worth mentioning. I'm about to buy two more of these bottles because sometimes I drink more than 7 per week!"
4,Sports cap,4 stars only because the cap as previously mentioned by others is unusable(difficult to open). Otherwise I'm satisfied with the bottle. It doesn't smell and appears to be durable and of course BPA free.
1,Didn't Last Very Long,I ordered my BlueWave bottle in March and now in July is has a hole where the plastic comes together. It was used less than 10 times overall and always hand washed and dried.
1,VERY disappointed,"I just recently started taking a medication that requires me to drink ALOT of water. so i thought this bottle would do the trick. when it first came.. i loved it. until i started noticing black specs on the inside of the bottle. i put it thru the dishwasher twice and it was still there. i even ordered a Good Grips bottle cleaner brush to try and get at the spots, but they weren't accessible cause of the handle. because the handle is set ""inside"" the jug, there are parts of the handle and under the handle that a brush, no matter how hard you try, can't get to. so.. i hate to say it.. but this bottle is going in the trash."
1,Absolutely Terrible Cheap Quality Product,"I bought this in order to use it regularly at the gym. Within three weeks, the bottle cracked and the company wasn't willing to replace it because I had bought it from AMZN. Inasmuch, they told me to deal directly with AMZN. AMZN's return policy had lapsed, so I'm stuck with a defective bottle. Terrible product and even worse customer service."
5,good stuff,Received it quickly and works great. I try to drink a gallon of water a day and this helps me keep track easily.
3,Water bottle,Not what I expected. I have had bad luck with water bottles made from this material. They crack easily.
3,Pay attention to the Cap,"There are a couple of comments about this. Unfortunately I didn't research as thoroughly as I usually do -- heck, it's a bottle, not a TV, so I thought I was okay. The cap on my bottle does not open. Forget how strong you are. I took it off and tried to push out from the inside, figuring if I could pop it once, it would be easier to pull? My cap is one solid molded piece and doesn't look like it was ever intended to open. I like the bottle itself and don't plan on returning it, but if this is how it is supposed to be, this should be part of the product description and not left for someone to find in the reviews. If this is not how it is supposed to be, then they should do better quality control."
3,Reveiw for livesquad.,"This CD WAS ALRIGHT, The TITEST SONG Is Mudderrah. TUPACS OTHERGROUP THUGLIFE SOUNDS LIKE THEM TOO. RIP TO THOSE ... BIG STRENCH AND KADIFI EVEN THOUGH STRENCH PLOTTED AGAINST MY ... TUPAC."
3,Serious Flare issues,"The Tokina 12-24 is very heavy, solid feeling wide-angle lens. Without doing any scientific testing, I was pleased with the IQ on some of the indoor shots. I ended up returning the lens, however because the level of flare and loss of contrast with a light source anywhere near being in frame was unacceptable for a lens I intended to use primarily outdoors.There is a newer version of this lens (don't know if it is available on Amazon yet) with different coatings. That may have corrected or mitigated the flare problem."
4,Tokina 12-24,"It's a very good lens! I can't give five stars because nothing is perfect. (If you have the sun in front of you the lens it does some lens flares... more than a Canon L series lens, that's the single problem) Otherwise, it's a very sharp lens, and the mechanical construction is very solid!"
5,Another Exceptional Collection!,"Because I own and love the first 4 Om Lounge CDs, this one was a no brainer--and yet I was still pleasantly surprised at just HOW great Vol. 5 is! This is definitely the best collection of mid-tempo, lounge-type music that has ever been. Fantastic! And the artists that it features are usually much more than the one song featured on an Om Lounge CD. 5 BIG STARS!!!!!"
1,Elevator music for the deaf . . .,"If you told me that there was no more jazz to listen to, and I had to choose between this and Lawrence Welk music, I'd have to think about it for a long time. On reflection, if the people who think this is music had been around in the 1950s, they would be Lawrence Welk fans. One star because because it would be wrong to lump it with so-called ""Country-Western Music"" which gets zero stars, and zero stars must remain meaningful."
5,Great Relpacement to my 20D,Bought the 30D to replace a 20D. I also got the 17-55IS to go with it. This camera is for my wife as we both shoot weddings and it has turned out to be a good investment. The camera performs well and has much better features than the 20D-really closer to my 5D.
5,Much better than what I expected from a EOS 20D upgrade,"A lot of reviewers have advocated the pixels count to be not a worthy reasons to upgrade. They claimed that 30D is just a 20D with a larger LCD. After 250 shots in low light and tried out the auto focus at 1250 ISO, I proved to myself that it is a worthy upgrade in many aspects:1) The LCD validated the picture's focus completely2) I lost none of the focus on 250 shots on a stage rehearsal3) The low light perfomance and high ISO performance are just excellent. Comparing to 30D, I would lost 20-30% shots due to out-of-focus.4) The larger buffer in allowing you to take rapid 5 shots/per sec is just increditable.Based on the above reasons, I felt that the upgrade from 20D to 30D is well justified."
4,Great bargain for a first/back up SLR,"I bought this camera refurbished and have been quite happy with its overall performance. It is similar to the 40D, but with less resolution. It does well when looking at the [...] testing when compared to the Canon XXD series. I have shot roughly 4000 clicks without a hitch. The lack of a sensor cleaner is a drawback. The LCD could be bigger/better, but in the end that doesn't effect what is framed on the wall.I have owned the XTI and much prefer this camera's feel and handling, but have to say the image quality appears roughly equal. More import is good glass!"
5,Best bet for family sports enthusiasts!,"The 30D is more than a simple upgrade to the stellar 20D camera, it's now a workhorse. The shutter has been upgraded to 100,000 exposure lifecycle (this is the standard rating of when you'll effectively wear the camera out beyond economical repairs).Combined with the metal construction, this will easily last several years in the hands of an advanced photographer, and can deliver professional results (although not as weatherproof or bulletproof as the Mark II series).The inclusion of the ""picture styles"" will be warmly appreciated from old time film users who liked different coloring and sharpness levels dependent on the subject. If you don't like Canon's settings, you can tweak them, or download addition styles from their website.Handling and performance are top-notch, and Canon offers the widest selection of lenses available today. This kit lenses is a good value for the money, but you might consider the EF-S 17-85 if you're budget allows."
5,List Price Wrong,"This version of Canon's semi-pro or pro-sumer camera is really great. HOWEVER THE LIST PRICE IS COMPLETELY WRONG, the camera was originally priced around $1100 NEW, in 2006-2007. Don't pay anything more than $700 for one NEW, or $400 for USED. I have been in photography since 2004 and camera retail since 2007, trust me on this one.I use the 20D and have for the last 5 years, same model, same camera, and it rocks. The 30D has a more user friendly firmware and a much, much bigger LCD, which I would like to have."
2,"It's great, when it works.","I've had this camera for less than a year. I have to ship it out for repair for a fourth time tomorrow. The first three times it went out were for focus problems. This time Canon actually shipped it back to me broken. With a new problem, not even what I send it in for. Each time I send it in it's at least two weeks. They promised me this time a manager would look at it. They promised me that last time and it didn't seem to matter much. To me, it's an expensive piece of junk."
3,Should have fixed the Flash,"Still, the flash creates a huge shadow from my lens, EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM.This was a big problem with the 20D and still is with the 30D. I had to buy a 580ex to overcome this problem. Yeah I know stupid me, why reward them for not fixing a huge problem known by them before introducing this product.Otherwise the camera is very well built and sturdy. I upgraded from a plastic Rebel, big difference in the quality of the LCD."
2,One Major Point to Bring Up.,"Enough has been said about this camera. There's full in depth reviews about performance and specs, but one thing that never gets brought up is the LCD live view. I don't understand why canon's cheaper point and shoot cameras have the active LCD where you don't need to look through the viewfinder to shoot, but the 10d, 20d, and 30d all lack this feature which is probably the most convenient as it becomes more versatile when shooting in awkward positions, areas. Now, canon has finally given us the Live LCD with the 40d. Good job canon for taking 5 years to incorporate something that a cheap $100 point and shoot camera already has. This was a huge disappointment when i got my camera."
5,Perfect upgrade from 300D (Digital Rebel),"I resisted the urge to upgrade to the 20D from the 300D (Digital Rebel) but couldn't resist the 30D. I have used the 300D for weddings before and found that I was often waiting for the buffer to clear - even when shooting jpegs.3 huge advantages of the 30D are:1 - no worries shooting at ISO 800 - even 3200 is usable, (the 300D is ordinary above 400)2 - 5 frames/sec (the 300D only has a 4 pic buffer @ 2.5 frames/sec, so rapid shooting with it is almost a non-event)3 - Spot metering (300D you have pretty much no control over the metering used, and certainly no spot meter).That's just a short list of the advantages of this camera over the 300D.I shot a wedding with the 30D last weekend and I was never waiting for the camera to catch up, and could have given it more than I did.I highly recommend it as an upgrade to the 300D. I'm keeping the 300D as a backup d-slr, but hope I don't have to use it. I loved the 300D, but I won't miss using it after using the 30D."
4,good cherries,"I didn't find any pits and that's saying something because whenever I buy cherries in the store, they always warn ""may contain pits"" and sure enough, I always find one. These were good without a lot of sweetener, and also didn't have the preservative flavor."
2,stale,"I love cherries ripe, jammed, dried, any way I can get them. I've eaten lot of different kinds of dried fruit from different providers. These were stale and I ended up throwing them out."
3,A lovely memory,"OK, technically we can fault this but it was a child of its time. A generation brought up on Star Wars might not understand that this was what we got as entertainment back in the very early 70s. Yes, this is a selection of a TV series and the editing's bad and so are the wigs but this was a low budget series back then. The language is totally too modern but go with the flow, enjoy and we women can admire the lovely Oliver Tobias who to his credit puts in a very believeable performance and the gorgeous Michael Gothard. A lovely momento of a series I wish was available in its entireity - using first generation tapes please!"
1,Boring,"This movie is a reduction of the original show made by collecting some episodes and sometimes only screen-shots of episodes, kept together by a narrator who tells the story of Arthur and the Celts.Maybe it is this puzzle like way chosen to present the show that makes it odd, but in any case it is a movie too much aged (in acting and colors) and the entire story is quite boring."
3,Sweet 'n' Sour,"Well it's about time this rarely seen series finally made it to Dvd,a gritty portrayal of the legend which i loved as a kid. However its been largely ruined by a distracting voiceover, poor quality tranfer and a confusing mess of editing. The original theme music has also been lost to a terribly cheap sounding soundtrack and crappy title sequence.Luckily for me i still have some complete episodes on VHS,however its about time this show had a digitally remastered full series release. Hopefully that UK based company Network Tv will get hold of it, as they have many other classic British Adventure serials of the 60's and 70's.I award my three stars solely for the chance to see the show again, not for quality or enjoyment."
4,A boon for the mature martial artist,"Unfortunately, anatomy and physiology is not commonly taught in martial arts classes. The need for some knowledge of these fields becomes more apparent the older the age of the student. Not only does the older student take longer to heal from injuries, but repetitive stress injury becomes a real possibility.This book addresses these issues in a forthright, helpful manner. Perry Sensei has put together a collection of text, diagrams and photographs that illustrate the common ways that even seemingly simple moves can be executed in a fashion that can cause injury.This information is totally applicable across the divisional lines of modern martial arts. His Shotokan background speaks as strongly to my Tae Kwon Do training as to his own discipline. I highly recommend this work."
3,Good Movie,Let me just say that 'Nova' is played by the actress Linda Harrison who must certainly be the most beautiful woman ever on screen....she's absolutely beautiful and her body in this movie is perfect without compare.geezGood movie.
5,Beyond a Beginner's Book,"Dr. Bulter's book is undoubtedly for the apiring ""heavyweights"" of Brazilian racial politics because it assumes that the reader has a basic to moderate understanding of Brazil's history, since it deals mainly with the political aspects of two of the major slave holding states after abolition (the late 1800's and onwards). This is a great thing for those who want detail--and yes, there are visuals. You can read overviews of Brazil in the encyclopedia; this is a book that can be brought into the classroom--undergraduate and graduate alike."
3,Needs better packaging,"Flag is nice but arrived damaged twice. The second time the damage was to the bottom of the pole so was usable. Didn't want the hassle of returning again, so made do."
3,Good,"This is an easy to install and good product with a very sturdy pole, but when I went riding my flad came off. Boo. Secure your flag ladies and gentlemen."
4,Excellent War Stories for Current and Would-be Consular Officers,"This collection of ""war stories"" from seasoned Consular officers makes for interesting and entertaining reading. As far as I am aware, this is the only really thorough exploration of the consular function in the U.S. Foreign Service (William Shepard's ""Consular Tales"" is thin by comparison.)I would particularly recommend this title as preparatory reading for any prospective consular officers about to take the State Department's Foreign Service Oral Exam, or for anyone considering a consular career in the Foreign Service.The book is expensive, but could be considered a worthwhile investment for one's career."
5,It was wonderful!,"I am an engineer by profession and haven't read anything other than reports, technical papers and journals for the best part of ten years. ""The Mole and the Owl"" re-introduced me to the joy of reading stories. My wife got through most of a box of tissues reading it!"
5,I am sitting here with tears in my eyes.,We all need to be reminded from time to time of the beauty of unconditional love. I intend to share this with my 13 year old daughter this evening.
5,Touched my soul in a way few stories have done before,"The lyrical prose and the wonderful illustrations touched my soul. The imagery lifted my spirit and often had me in tears. It is a tale that inspires one to take a breath and see the beauty that surrounds us all, and most of all, to DREAM. This book shall be a treasured part of my personal library, and I am looking forward to sharing it with my children, and possibly someday, my grandchildren."
1,packaging sucks,got half way through the series got to scraches pisses me off don't buy it your better off buying them separate i might have to do that anyway
3,Wish Mill Creek would stop doing this,"Mill Creek will put out one or two or three seasons then all of a sudden put out the complete series. So those who bought the seasons, have to double dip. The only good thing is that Mill Creek is inexpensive. But what do I do with seasons one and two that I bought previously? Just glad the whole series is out at a reasonable cost."
4,Read this book first!!!,"Not any other book on finding a job in film production is as funny, as encouraging and as easy to read as this one. You walk away inspired and full of enthusiasm, something very necessary for anyone starting out. ALL the basics are covered and it gives you the self-confidence that you know at least what the heck people are talking about. Read it, learn it and know it, then work hard and you'll be allright."
5,Great Buy!,This book is really great and informative. I would encourage anyone learning about movie production and cinema that they pick this up and learn some things. Great price for it too!
4,I think its cute,I think it is cute. I got it for my daughters room. I gave it a 4 just because it actually doesn't look like the picture. Its base and top is black not silver. Its not a big deal to me.... but I could see if someone was trying to coordinate a room by colors or whatever... it might be nice to know that. It came in fast. I would buy it again..
3,Not for medical terminology,I needed this book for a medical terminology assignment. Out of the 25 words assigned to define only 8 were in this book. If you need a medical dictionary for any medical courses I wouldn't suggest this one.
3,Okay,"I am a nursing student. The book worked great at first, but then it got to the point that I was not able to find a lot of words in it. Every third or fourth word I have to look up is not in this dictionary. I guess that is what I get for not checking into what I buy before I buy it."
5,Used for school,"Book was received as indicated. Did not have any issues with order, it was received as the order stated. Would order again."
3,the book,this is a good book. but after looking deeper into the book I realized its not what I needed for school.
2,Not a Complete Reference Book,"I picked this book partly due to the fact that it came with the complete medical dictionary on a CD. It would be great to leave the book at school and install the software on my home computer...medical books are heavy!!!Unfortunately, most of the medical words that I've had to look up in my courses have not been in this reference book. I'm taking a medical secretarial course, so this book would be a major disappointment for anyone taking nursing or medical."
1,Spend your money on something else,If you are looking for a good technical resource than this is not your book. Much of what I needed was not in the book and there are no pronunciations for the terms. I would not recommend
3,A Good Dictionary,"I read the reviews saying not all the important words were there but somehow I wanted to try myself. Unfortunatly that was true. I did not find many words there and I had to buy another one. However, If you find what you need in it, the definitions are excellent. (A general worker in Health care might find it useful, but professionals or students will need another one)."
2,Not very in-depth,This book does not go in-depth at all. I needed a book for a medical terminology class and this one just did not cut it. I am returning it.
2,Too limited,The terms of this book are too simple and limited. This is a bad medical dictionary book.
2,All flash. Not very good quality.,"A real colorful and flashy bike, however there were several things wrong with it.1. the tires had so much excess rubber, it had to be trimmed or else it rubbed.2. The back wheel had to be completely removed to loosen the bearings. If not done, the bike would basically come to a stop by itself.3. the main (front) sprocket is slightly bent, so the chain falls off constantly.4. the bike if VERY heavy. maybe that makes it sturdy, but it also makes it tough for a 4 year old to ride.I should have just bought a bike off the floor at Wal-Mart or Target for half the price."
3,RE-ISSUED BUT NOT REMASTERED,"This review is based on the quality of the re-issue, not the material.Based on the 2 previous reviews, I thought these CD's were remastered. THEY ARE NOT. The only thing new is the cover photo. I already have the individul CD's in this collection and the CD's in this set are exactly the same. All they did is re-package them. These CD's were mastered in 1990 and 1991. The sound is OK for that time, but they are in need of a real remaster. There are no new liner notes. The CD album inserts are exactly like the ones from the indiviual CD's. The sound is at a low level, the bass lacking and highs are tinny.At least the full album version of Love to Love you baby is available on the Ultimate Collection CD and it IS remastered. Hopefully, they will eventually remaster these albums for the fans. So far, Bad Girs (Deluxe Edition) is Donna's only full album to be recently remastered."
2,The packaging is VERY poor.,"Packaged like a box set, this compilation from Mercury containsLove to Love You Baby, A Love Trilogy, and Four Seasons of Love -the three albums Donna Summer released during 1975 and 1976.The packaging is as cheap as it gets.The plastic rungs are flimsy and can't hold the discs,so the discs will slip out every time the set is handled.The individual booklets for each album are included,so you could put the discs in separate jewel cases,but you'd be missing the tray cards for the spines & back covers."
5,Bravo!!!,"I have been waiting for remastered versions of Donna Summer's classic albums...and here are three more (Bad Girls is already out!). Sound is amazing...to hear the full version of ""Try me...."" ""Could it be magic"", and All of Four Season of Love remastered really puts it all back in focus...THESE ARE GREAT ALBUMS!!!"
1,The WORST movie I have ever seen in 20 years!,"This movie is full of stupid tricks and dumb, predictable plots. Out of all the western movies I've seen, this has to be the worst! And the acting was pretty terrible too..."
1,"- Cough, Cough -","Wow, 246 Amazon reviewers, and they all think Val Kilmer is good in this movie. I don't know how anybody could watch this ludicrous performance -- the beady little raisin eyes, the strangled Brando-impersonation voice, the psychotic self-absorption -- and not recoil in embarrassment. Imagine not being able to out-act Victor Mature, who was actually a far better Doc in ""My Darling Clementine."" Watch that movie and you'll see this for the souped-up high school production it is."
3,"Great Movie, Questionable DVD","I love Tombstone. It's a great movie, one of my favorite popcorn westerns. That said, this isn't a great transfer. The sound is muddy, and way too quiet. I was trying to watch it with my dad, and he had a hard time making out the dialog even with the sound on his TV cranked to 100%. I've not seen/heard the ""director's cut"" version (Tombstone - The Director's Cut (Vista Series)), but I'd have to guess its sound is better than this. It's a 5-star movie (as long as you're not expecting an Oscar-caliber script), but I had to take off a couple stars because of the DVD's quality."
4,Must-have for western fans,"This movie is a fantastically entertaining flick. I compare its vibe to ""The Wild Bunch,"" as it's a very testosterone-driven movie, filled with some great characters, dialogue and of course, gunfights. Val Kilmer and Michael Biehn deliver two very memorable movie characters, while Kurt Russell gives one of his best performances. The rest of the supporting cast is great - Bill Paxton, Sam Elliott, and Powers Booth keep the film grounded when it could've simply become the ""Kurt and Val Show."" From solid acting, set-pieces, action sequences, and dialogue, this movie delivers."
5,Best video EVER of the story of Wyatt Earp and company,This film in it's on right to me is legendary. I was most overwhelmed by Val Kilmer's role as Doc Holiday. This film is a MUST SEE for lovers of the old west and the story of these four companions.
5,THE BEST WESTERN EVER,"Quite simply the best western I've ever seen!! Kurt Russell is outstanding as Wyatt Earp, but Val Kilmer steals the show as Doc Holliday. The film has immortal lines such as Wyatt Earp:""Damn right your'e scared I can see it in your eyes"" and "" You tell them I'm coming back and hell's coming with me, you hear me?...hell's coming with me""Doc Holliday : ""Oh Johnny I apoligise, I forget you were there.... you may go now!! ""Why Johnny Ringo, you look like somebody just walked over your grave"" MAGNIFICENT!! I urge everybody to see this film."
4,An Impressive Performance by Val Kilmer,"Frankly, I'm not a Kilmer fan -- didn't think he could act all that well. This movie proves me wrong -- Mr. Kilmer CAN act and act very well. He just needs the right script/character. His character, Doc Holliday, made the movie for me. The lines were great, the talent was exquisite. Kudos to you, sir!"
5,Loved This Movie,"All the actors did a great job, but, I think Doc/Kilmer is the one who really put the fire in this movie. He was so ""cool"" I loved it. Nobody could beat him in anything he did, he was the best at everything and even his sickness didn't dampen his spirit. I can't watch the part when he gives his last words to his best friend Wyatt. I think it's just too sad to see such a vibrant fire burn out. (I cried everytime I seen it, so I quit watching that part) Otherwise the movie was excellent."
5,i love westerns,I love western films and this one did not disappoint. Wonderful film with great characters and awesome acting! If you like westerns this is a must see film.
5,Tombstone,We love this movie and being able to get it on blu-ray made it even better. Was a great price and came in the mail quickly.
5,In My Top 5 Favorite Westerns for Sure,"Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell are the driving force that makes this film work. Sure it isn't totally realistic, but it is more fun than any other western I have seen. The gunfight at the OK Corral in the film is probably the best you will ever see at showing what most likely really happened on October 26, 1881. Val Kilmer steals every scene he is in and spews forth some of the coolest lines you will ever here coming out of a western movie. Kilmer's Doc Holliday is one of the only roles I can stand him in and he is an absolute genius at this part. I'm not a huge fan of Kurt Russell either, but he is my favorite Wyatt Earp by far. This is a must have western that is more fun than Kevin Costner's Wyatt Earp, but I would see that one too for a more accurate depiction of Earp's life."
5,a great movie!,What a great movie! I've always been a fan and finally spent the money to get a copy for myself so I can watch anytime!
4,Tombstone VHS Tape,"I wanted a copy of the movie Tombstone with Kurt Russell. Found it on Amazon, ordered it and I am very satisfied with this product."
5,"Tombstone, The Director's Cut","If you think you liked the released version of Tombstone, you'll absolutely love The Director's cut. This DVD is a favortite in my hometown, but then maybe I'm a little biased......BTD, Tombstone, Arizona"
5,The Second Best Film of the 1990's,"Pair this one with Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" and you have the two superlative movies of the last decade. This remake far surpasses the original ""Gunfight at the O.K. Corral,"" with its perfect casting of Kurt Russell, Powers Boothe, Sam Eliott, Bill Paxton, and Jason Priestly who shows that he can exist outside of the ""90210"" zip code.But it is Val Kilmer, one of Tinseltown's most gifted ""chameleons"" who immerses himself as the legendary Doc Holliday. Everyone in my circle of friends lauded his performance as one of the finest that has ever graced the silver screen.The guy can act!"
3,Awesome Movie,But that's about it. The Dvd portion of it didn't have behind the scenes or commentary. I felt it could have been so much more. Especially since the movie was so rich in history
5,Terrific,"Tombstone is not your usual country western movie. It has action, thrills, love and all the other elements of a great movie. This is one of the few westerns that I can actually sit through and watch with enjoyment. As soon as I purchace this mvoie I know I will find myself watching is over and over again!!"
3,VIOLENT,"OK. I expected violence--it's a western and rated R. But don't think this is one where you can close your eyes during the rough bits. If you did, you'd get only about 20 minutes of viewing. From start to finish--VIOLENCE. The amount and detail of violence was distracting because there was little time for believable plot development. Ugh."
5,If You Are wondering if this is The Directors Cut,"If you are like me, a directors cut can totally ruin a film for you. Tombstone is by far one of my favorite films that I owned on Video Cassette, Letterbox DVD, and Anamorphic DVD. I had to get rid of the Anamorphic b/c it was the DC. I couldn't watch it without cringing every time a new scene or cut hit me. I guess I am one of those cranky film preservationists. Between the timeless story and the power of the ensemble cast, Tombstone is one of the greatest. Whether you a fan of westerns or not, it's a sure bet. To my satisfaction, (according to imdb.com) the directors cut clocks in at 134, the original 130. So according to the stats here, this here blu-ray should be the Theatrical Version. I look forward to watching this movie in HD in the coming weeks."
1,Are you kidding me?,"Wow, Blu-Ray just isn't all it's purported to be. Tell me why, a disc that is supposed to able to hold 6X the information than a standard DVD is merely used to hold the bare minimum for a film. Oh I know, the movie studios want to gouge you for all the money they can. Notice this BR is NOT the Director's Edition of the film. So some day in the future, they'll release it again and expect you to buy it in it's Director's version. Um no. I think I'll keep the Vista Series Director's Cut and skip this.Also, have you noticed that Amazon, rather than have a clear and empty comment section for this version of the film, continue to post the comments from the various prior editions. They need to fix this."
2,Not that great,"I've tried to watch ""Tombstone"" many times but have been unable to watch it all the way through because it's just plain SILLY. On the other hand I've watched ""Wyatt Earp,"" the Kevin Costner movie a dozen times, and will probably watch it a dozen more. It fascinates me."
5,Tombstone DVD,"This is an all time classic. If you haven't seen it, please do yourself a huge favor and do so!"
4,the last great western,"I went to see the film when I was 19 with a friend just out of pure boredom.I went in anticipating a watered-down Hollywood movie where all the actors have mullets and bad southern accents.I left the theater dumbstruck by it's beauty.This is my second favorite western after ""The Wild Bunch""--a very CLOSE second.If you don't feel any romanticism for the old west after watching this movie,well,you just ain't human.The acting is top-notch,the set design is brilliant,and the costumes are perfect.This film was so good,that it just ruined Kevin Costner's subsequent ""Wyatt Earp"" for me.""Tomstone"" went almost un-noticed in late '93-early '94,but it has gained a great reputation of the years.I found it funny at the time when all of the critics complained of all of the mustaches in the film.I'm surprised they didn't complain about all of the six-shooters and cowboy hats!"
5,Worth the wait,I waited forever for Tombstone to come out in Blu Ray. Well worth the wait. One of my all time favorite westerns. The clarity is excellent. I'm your huckleberry.
5,"One of the Best ""New"" Westerns Ever",Do not hesitate. How can all of us be wrong? I promise you will love this movie. It has everything a good movie requires to survive over time. I have watched this movie numerous times and enjoy it more and more each time. One of my favorites by far.
5,Great Movie,"This is not the deepest movie I have ever seen, which is the reason it is the best western I have ever seen. I don't want to have to think about it, and have to watch it 10 times to get it, I want to watch it 10 times because it is a lot of fun to watch. There are chick flicks, and there are guy flicks, and this one is both. My wife thought the guys were hot, and I thought the action was great.Don't get me wrong, Clint Eastwod westerns are good, John Wayne is good, but this movie was one we both thoroughly enjoyed."
1,Tombstone,"The dvd played great the first time, but now it stalls or skips and will not play.The movie however is a great movie.Just an fyi the movie was not filmed in Tombstone,AZ."
2,Poor Western,"Overall, you know the story. Villans changed a bit, not better. Ancillary plot lines not interesting. Big Hollywood over the top redo of simpler story. Ridiculous mustaches. I much prefer a John Ford western."
4,A fun departure,Ok so anytime you gather this many stars in one film you might have the tendency to see the stars and not the characters. After reading some other reviews I wonder if people were actually paying attention or too busy picking it apart to just enjoy a great performace on a very loose rendition of the old west. I DIG THIS FILM AND RECOMEND IT HIGHLY.peace out.
4,Sound track NOT Dolby Digital 5.1!,"Obviously the movie is great, and often underrated. But as for the DVD, beware that the disc isn't encoded with Dolby Digital 5.1. Instead, it's just Dolby Surround. I had gotten lax about checking before I bought, and I had begun to assume that every DVD had 5.1, so I didn't discover this until it was too late. I wonder why they didn't include DD????"
3,not The DC cut theater version,"Unless my source is completely wrong, [...], this is the theatrical version. I do love this movie & I will add it when it is the Directors cut. I love this over Wyatt Earp by Costner. I love this movie & I wish I could find the Wyatt Earp in the movie that is the great,great,great grandson to Wyatt."
2,Even their moustaches were phony,"The stars in this movie were just to clean, to well dressed plus everything seemed phony. Even their moustaches were phony. Bad acting all around this had to be made for TV. 2 1/2 stars at best."
1,Detail,"I'd have loved to review this video, but as it is from a different zone than me I'm unable. Clearly stating the area and country I'm from doesn't have much impact. Perhaps one day I'll visit the USA and then be able to see it."
1,"Trash with a capital ""T""","Tombstone is probably THE most overrated movie ever made. George Cosmotos couldn't land any decent directing gigs since Rambo First Blood Part 2 and thankfully won't direct a movie again (RIP). This movie is a collection of unfinished scenes starring respectable actors who have no idea they are in the hands of a hack. Only people who like American Beauty, Pulp Fiction, and Office Space will be attracted to this trash. Get ready for two hours of your life you will NEVER get back. Michael Beihn and Val Kilmer chew through their scenes with immense energy (and are worth watching) but they can't save this deflated and uninteresting turd. Is this disc any good? Who cares?! Don't waste your time or your money--or wait for it to hit the $5.00 bin at Wal-Mart."
2,The man who wouldn't die / Val Kilmer or Superman 15,I thought that the movie was okay and I'm being generous when I say that...The movie went on and on and just when I thought I was going to puke.Val Kilmer shows up still trying to die from Tuberculosis.It just got old after a while.
4,This is a Great movie.,"I have seen this movie so many times, that I can't count anymore. This move Was Great, I could have been better. A few of the shortcuts, Like not having rain on all of the visible streets when Morgan dies. Or when Morgan's Blood dosen't wash off of Wyatt in the rain. But there are too many Great lines in this to even quote one. I would say it is a MUST SEE. But only about 20 or 30 times, I should say.Hey when is the wide screen version coming out?"
