1,Please Give Me a Break,"I think it's interesting that most of these glowing reviews are from Lehr's hometown, L.A. and that they typically don't include more than two lines. Come on, folks, let's be honest. The writing is stilted, the ""message"" completely self-absorbed. I'm sure Ms. Lehr is a very interesting person. But she needs an editor and several years in Iowa."
1,They let her into Yaddo?,"This book is built on a good idea, but the execution is poor. Lehr presents herself as self-absorbed and spoiled, which I thought was actually the redeeming, honest part of the book. But the writing is abysmal. Her simplistic sentence structure and robotic dialogue make for a bumpy ride. I can't believe she got a spot at Yaddo--there are thousands of better writers out there who deserve an art colony stay and a published book."
5,MUST READ!,Compelling piece of work. Lehr's writing style is blunt and fun to read. Bridget Jones who? Sex and the City who? What an emotional roller coaster that all of us can relate too in one-way-or-another.
5,Dark Shadows Collection19,"EXCELLENT... Very enjoyable to be able to watch this Gothic soap at my own pace. I was awufully young when the soap first came out, things that did not make a lot of sense then, make a lot of sense now. I think the COLLINS family has made a lifelong impression on MANY people .. I love how they go from ""ONE TIME LINE TO ANOTHER"" . The plots just all seem to run together and make for a great SOAP."
1,Good for pre-schoolers. (3 to 6 years old),"If you have ever seen anybody wakeboard you will know more about it than you could ever hope to learn from this book. It might be okay if you have just learn't how to read, but if you want any helpful information on how to wakeboard, forget this book. It will only leave you feeling stupider than before you started. Keep your money in your pocket and keep looking for something better."
3,Cheese on toast,"I got into the Fania All Stars through the excellent SoulJazz NuYorica compilations, with the hard salsa sound and incredible musicianship which is amazingly polished but still has an edge of soul/roughness and improvisation. This is not a ""best of"" from that sound - a couple of real scorchers here like Coro Miyare and Juan Pachanga. But the rest is not that sound, it's really smooth, really pretty cheesy to my ears and I'm not sure why it's classified as a best of - it's limited to the cross-over albums they made in the late 70s."
4,An Elegant Curve,"Before reading this book,I rarely imagine about how elegant can bridges be. Mr. Calatrava brings those imposibilities to people,especially those who never dream. Maybe I should not talk too much,because words can not bring Calatrava's thoughts to the readers precisely. Through this book,let us try to find a path to discover Calatrava's world."
2,Lovely and Tasteful for your special evenings,"These are charms that complement your wine and cheese theme for a pleasant evening. The colors make this set pretty to look at. I receive compliments every time I use them. Some of my guests will even trade wine glasses to get the charm of their choice. They are easy to hook on or off your wine glasses. I have had mine for 6 years now and they still look and work nicely.***UPDATE***WARNING*** I ordered these again in the spring of 2010 for a gift since the originals were so beautiful. But the new set was AWFUL! Poorly painted, and cheap looking. What happened?? The colors on my originals were enamaled and pretty. The latest set was something just slopped on. I didn't keep them. I can no longer recommend them since I can't say what you'll get!"
5,Great Design,I bought these back in 2009 and use about once a month. They are fairly easy to put on and take off. The designs are very classy and look more detailed than a lot of the wine glass charms I have seen in other stores. Love these!
4,MAP kinase,MAP kinase cascade in defense-response against environmental stresses in plant. MAP kinase homology search.
1,Works but not well. Stay away from these.,"I installed these into my 1998 Durango's rear hatch. They fit just fine. The problem I have is that when you pull on the hatch it flies open really fast until it gets just below where it needs to stop, then stops. It's actually dangerous. I won't let the kids open it anymore. They didn't do this until they were in the truck a month and too late for a return. BEWARE!!Update 10/9/2010: I hate these things. Now I'll need to spend another 50 bucks on another pair from another manufacturer. I'd rather have the ones I threw away, back on.Run far away!!!!"
3,Irene Schweizer / Mani Neumeier - 'European Masters Of Improvisation' (Captain Trip),"Until recently, I've never even known about this 1990 (is that right?) Captain Trip label release - as I usually kep track of everything the label unleashes on us eager fans. This is not my cup of tea - but to be fair, I would say the music here is aimed toward die-hard fans of 'improvisation'. Couple of tunes here that I sort of liked (not enough to run out and buy this import CD, of course) were the seventeen-minute ""Serious Fun"" and maybe ""Sisterhood Of Spit"". Line-up here is strictly a duo - Irene Schweizer - piano and Mani Neumeier - drums & percussion."
3,A Fair Read,"I thought the beginning was very good, but as the story progressed I had to agree with one of the other reviewers that there were just too many unusual coincidences to be believable. People, places, and arrivals were just to convenient to be true.Other than that, it was a fair read."
3,Well made but not what I expected,"I liked the handles, ankle cuff and the door mounting loop. They seemed to be pretty well made. However, I falsely assumed that the 3 different cords would offer different levels of resistance. Unfortunately, that was not the case. The resistance isn't very strong, so I decided to return it and look for something with variable resistance."
2,As if Shakespeare wasn't hard enough to read...,"Buyer beware,The text in this book is difficult to read. The script is printed in old English, and its font is rather tricky to become accustomed to. Also, there are words that simply aren't printed properly, so that's only beneficial if you like to GUESS what Shakespeare was writing.It's worth owning for collecting sake, but not very practical."
1,music for kids....,"Molejo maybe could be good music for kids, but beware...Molejo can also destroys your brain with similar rhythims and totally childish lyrics..."
2,"Wonderful stories, melodramatic readings; nearly unlistenable","It is almost a crime to subject classic short stories such as these to this kind of audio treatment. Each is introduced with cheap sound effects or maudlin music. The reader is hopelessly overdramatic, mispronounces words like ""coquettry"" and cheapens the narrative with dripping emotion and weird rhetorical lifts in his voice. Worst of all is the dialogue which, as if in a radio play, is read by a variety of voices, women for female characters, men for male. Accents are over-wrought, turning the dialogue of masters like Twain and Fitzgerald into caricature. These great stories should be read and, if they must be read aloud, done with respect rather than fear that listeners might be bored without cheap theatrics."
3,Battery life?,"I am shocked that no reviews speak of the supposed 6 hour battery life. The battery life is only 6 hours using the minimum -5 brightness. At this level the screen is not viewable! The picture is beautiful at +5, but the battery life is only 3 hours at that level.That being said, this item has incredible picture quality and sound. Small and light, seems to have all of the features. Also the picture quality is still pretty good at -1 brightness which translates into about 4hours 15 minutes battery life.This is my first portable DVD player. Perhaps all of the brands have a similar method of measuring battery life, but I find it misleading, bordering on dishonest."
2,Nonfunctional after 1 year,"This DVD player was well used in the ~13 months since purchase until suddenly ""Error H03"" was displayed on the screen and the player could not read the DVD. After looking into having it repaired, (cost being from $95-160, depending on what was found) we decided to purchase the LS80 ($155) as we had this model before and had no problems for over two years until our toddler son dropped it and it subsequently stopped working. After reading the reviews, I am not alone in having the ""Error H03"" message and a nonfunctional player after the 12 mo. warranty has expired. Note, there were similar reviews re: the LS82 ($180) model, which we considered as that battery life is 12 hours. Both the LS80 and LS91 have 6 hr battery lives."
3,Well.......,I bought this simply because of a song off it I heard on some tv show..I think it was Criminal Minds. I never listen to it anymore...very slow and dark. Depressing to me.
2,Not a Clean Reprint,"It seems that this book was reprinted using OCR scanning. As a result there are errors in the text, which can be quite annoying to a reader. If I were to do it again, I'd look for a copy of the original printing."
2,Not what I expected,"The as received packaging did not look the picture.I was not pleased with quality of resulting copies.Copies had blotches and streaks, as if the drum was not new.I"
2,"Odd graphics, slow gameplay, little replay value","If you have a 3-10 year old that struggles with the faster morechallenging games on the n64, this may satisfy. Otherwise avoid. Theplayers (characters from the TV show) are rendered in low res 3d graphics that are annoying to look at and dimly colored compared to the cartoon. The 4 different 'hunts' play like a board game with the computer taking the palce of a missing player. Spinning for turns and waiting for the computer to move is agonizingly slow."
1,The worst game EVER!,"I purchased a Nintendo 64 for my 6 and 9-year-old nieces approximately 18 months ago after raving about how great the system was and how much fun they were going to have playing with it. The mistake I made was purchasing (AT FULL PRICE) the WORST game in video game history!!! These poorly animated characters do nothing more than go around in a circle while trying to find ""treasure"" pieces-and that's it folks! It's the dullest most boring mind numbing thing they have ever played! Thank goodness I made up for it by getting them another game, any other game is better than this one! It is, without doubt, the biggest waste of money I have spent for any game or toy that I can remember. A pet rock is more fun!"
1,Terrible,"Called in Australia ""Treasure Hunt"". I bought this on the basis of the TV show, as would most people. My 6 year old was quite excited.We feel totally let down. It was VERY expensive ($A99) and is BORING. It held his interest for about an hour, before he was out of there! We play traditional board games for longer than this - and the game play in this is slower than a board game where you move the pieces yourself.Just don't waste your money. It was an expensive lesson to check amazon reviews before buying in future! END"
1,Dont Waste A Dollar for this game on Christmas,Youre Child may love the show but the game is the very different from the shows I mean can you even beat the game you would have to be a Pro to beat it and its a 5 year old game!!.... A Bugs Life is worth more then this.Dont rent or buy this game.
1,BORING!,"I rented this game from my local video shop a few weeks ago and it was appauling! Despite the fact that there are only three levels in this game, the objective of the game (walking round in circles and stuff to find ""treasure"") and the description on the back of the box made it ten times worse, I kind of got this on an impulse after previously watching the Rugrats TV show and playing other Rugrats games. Seriously, If your going to even bother renting it, you may as well get the best Rugrats game of all, Rugrats: Search for Reptar."
1,Hunt for another game,"Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt was very disappointing. I've come to expect more from Nintendo after playing games like Super Mario & Banjo-Tooie. The play is slow and boring for anyone over the age of 6 and unless you have 4 people playing it, you have to wait for the computer to take its 3 turns. Even if you have 3 other players, you don't get much play time waiting for everyone elses turn. Lost my interest quickly. I would not recommend it."
4,"""Cute, Fun For Rugrat Fans.""","This is a good game for young gamers. My 9 year old gets bored with this one but plays along with my 4 year old, who likes it. They both like the Rugrats cartoons and movie and since this game has most of the regular characters in it, it keeps their interest."
1,This is not fun at all,This game only as 4 choices and to do one it just takes 1 minute to do so it is not worth the money so dount buy it all it is doing is trying to get your money do not waste your money
1,Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt - Hunt for another game,"Rugrats: Scavenger Hunt was very disappointing. I've come to expect more from Nintendo after playing games like Super Mario & Banjo-Tooie. The play is slow and boring for anyone over the age of 6 and unless you have 4 people playing it, you have to wait for the computer to take its 3 turns. Even if you have 3 other players, you don't get much play time waiting for everyone elses turn. Lost my interest quickly. I would not recommend it."
1,The Worst Game I've ever Played in my Entire Life!,"This is just a knock-off of the Mario Party series.All you do is walk around a board as a character from Rugrats.The graphics are horrible,because there just low-res polygonal pictures.If you want a real board game for the N64,get Mario Party.This game is an insult to the N64!"
1,Callous and careless,I wanted this cd but they sent me a dvd instead that appeared to have the same order number. This was not looked into as I requested and no attempt to send what I had really ordered was made.
2,Expiring soon!,"We bought this item from Amazon couple of weeks back, and the product expiry date was just 2 months from the purchase date. So was really disappointed! Usually infant vitamin drops that we buy at the local pharmacies do not expire for atleast a year or two.."
3,Good-humored fun!,"I really enjoyed this, as well as the first, book of actual legal transcript excerpts. I only wish the book was larger, with more of the delightfully scary expressions of judges, counsel, and witnesses! Three stars are awarded for the price v. amount of laughs."
3,Funny courtroom satire,"If you like dry satire, you'll like these little courtroom excerpts. Although the setting is the legal arena, it's less about law and more about the idiotic things people say. Good for a quick laugh."
5,Great Book,This is a great book on learning about the Old Testament. It will highlight all of the important books of the Testament. Great for a quick understanding.
5,Gentry is a scriptural surgeon,"What more can I add that the overwhelming positive feedback already hasn't? Gentry is a mastermind not because he's smart or is good with Scripture - he is one because he (like the good ones before and after him) allows the data to interpret itself. Gone from Gentry's work is vast, sweeping generalizations and random guessing. He doesn't ""make predictions"" based on a religious tingle that arises through him. He makes conclusions based on calculations that the bible calls for.More great reads on the subject are:'Daniel: Prophet to the Nations' by Oakes'Christian Origins and the Question of God Vol. 1-3' by Wright'An Eschatology of Victory' by Kik'Days of Vengeance' by Chilton"
5,"Technical, yet clear treatment -- extremely convincing!","Having been exposed only to mainstream Evangelical thought, I had not been aware that an alternative orthodox position to Dispensationalism regarding the end-times existed. Although originally a skeptic, after a few months of study, I've come to the conclusion that the doctrine of the Rapture is heresy, and this book helped me immensely!! If you want to know the truth about the end-times from a Biblical perspective, this book is a must!!"
5,Worth every penny,"Kenneth, thanks for taking the time to write this book. You really did your research!! Anyone who reads this is miles ahead of everyone else in regards to the FACTS about a true dating of Revelation. It is worth every penny and readers will not be disappointed. I highly recommend this book for anybody who is interested in end time events. It will be a great addition and investment to your library. As for me, I really broke in my highlighter."
1,No visible basket in a basketball game?? - Don't buy it.,"I am an avid retro gaming fan and I had high hopes for this product. I bought it last week and all I can say is ""don't buy it"", even if you are a die hard Intellivision fan. I didn't have an issue with the controller, the problem is with the programming. Some of the games are missing important graphic elements. For example, with Super Pro basketball, the baskets aren't even visible! The players are shooting the ball at nothing! Save your money. This product is a huge disappointment - I'm returning it today"
3,Not THAT bad...,"The easiest way to explain this is pretend they took 25 Intellivision games and downgraded them to play on an Atari 2600 cartridge and you can imagine just how this thing plays. It's not that terrible, Astrosmash is OK, Space Armada is average,Shark Shark is Very S-L-O-W but OK and I actually liked Space Battle. Baseball really sucks but the more you play, the more this system gains a couple stars.The biggest obstacle is that the activision,atari and Namco units are all pretty good while this is just slightly below average.But ALL Intellivision fans MUST bite the $20.00 and pick this up because Intellivision Productions is an underground company that is doing its best to keep retro gaming alive and we MUST SUPPORT them through thick and thin.P.S. The sound really stinks.."
1,Save your $20,Intellivison fans... Do not waste your money. This unit is not anything like the original. The sound effects are terrible & some games play silent. What a HUGE dissapointment this so called system has been.
3,Good debut...not great.,"- The book has the feel of some other authors (stolen loot is El Leonard, funny Florida characters, a little Hiaasen, etc.)- There are a lot of bad guys and even the good guys aren't that good so I'm not really sure who to root for.- The main character's flaws don't seem that fresh- The plot flips around a lot which is the most entertaining part of the book including an extremely funny murder.- Author has good ideas, long chunks of the book are fast-paced.- Somehow, towards the end, I wish the whole thing had picked up the pace instead of flattening out to a semi-original ending.- I will DEFINITELY read this author's next book."
5,This book sizzled along,"This is the most compelling, fast paced, intelligent book I've read in a year. The story of a cop framed by a FBI agent is funny, and feels like it really happened. A crooked reverend takes cash from the homeless but the FBI agent steals it. When things get hot he pins it on a Florida State agent.This felt like a good movie. I coul;d see the action unfold and felt like the characters were fighting for their lives.I loved this book and recommend it to anyone, not just readers of mysteries."
5,The tango master,"The box set was everything I had hoped for - as much Astor Piazzolla as I can get. The classic Piazzolla tangos are there, as well as some more obscure works, but listening to the 3-CD set gives you a full flavor of his mastery of a passionate, emotionally raw music."
5,A Guide to the Gospel as Wisdom Tradition,"Read this book and learn to listen to the Gospel from within, with the mind descended into the heart. Round out the practice with other excellent books in this genre, including The Kingdom Within (John Sanford), The New Man (Maurice Nicoll), and Lost Christianity (Jacob Needleman)."
3,The Missing Page,The urge to know the content of the Missing Page is so overpowering that I have to restraint myself from peeping into the last page. Good suspense for people that understand the political sensitivity in this part of the world. Cut down on the sex though.
3,colagen gel,"This is no doubt a quality product. My objection was to the added color and fragrence that was not present in my original purchase. The person that I purchased the product for was not pleased with this aspect, and did not wish to use it or to pay me for it. Had I known of the true nature of the item prior to purchasing it, I probably would not have done so."
4,Gift,I bought it as a gift and it has been watched several times by the person I bought it for. Personally I watched it one time with the 11 year old who I got it for and thought it was Tv movie quality.
3,"Easy to watch, but nothing more","A really American movie, with a good end. More of TV movie is based on a true story about a kid that died, his family, their inspiration and football. What more American than that.The football scenes are not that great, and in general the movie is more of a family, late night movie that commemorates the ordeal of a family and the memory of a kid that died so young"
5,Great Movie,"The Fifth Quarter was a movie that a friend of mine suggested to me on facebook. Until then I had never heard of this movie but since they loved it so much, I decided to order it and watch it. The Fifth Quarter is a great movie and I recommend everyone to watch this movie. I was not disappointed in it at all and five it a five star rating. I knew Amazon would have it and found it right away and ordered it."
1,5th Quarter,I rec'd a DVD that did not work. It will not play so that is why I rated this item so low.
5,"Inspiring film,. worthy of Oscars","Why this film was not released in theaters I will never know, It is inspiring, touching, and beautifully made. Aiden Quinn gives a performance that would ordinarily be considered for an Academy Award. I hope the movie finds a wide audience now that it has been released on DVD."
5,One of the most moving movies,"I first rented this movie, not knowing much about it, and figured it would be a sports story like ""we are marshall"" or something along those lines. A movie has never made my sob within the first 15 minutes of it starting. This movie leaves you with a great message, and inspiration. This is now my favorite movie. I would recommend this to anyone, just be ready to cry, and cry, and cry!"
4,Great movie,"Sports movie everyone can enjoy. True story, Very strong cast that actually made you feel the story. You Won't be disappointed with this movie."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"The story was good and as a true story, it had an inspiring ending.There was a very good cast so I was disappointed to see that some of the acting was over the top. It did not look as if the acters were really feeling the emotions. I was sorry to only be able to give this movie 3 stars and wished I had just rented it instead of buying it."
2,"Too quick, disconnected feeling with story",Wanted to like it --- everything happens so fast that a viewer has little time to actually get to know the characters. Movie simply doesn't work.
5,Awesome family movie,"This is a very moving story that I think everyone should see. Having four children I can't even imagine losing one. I was sobbing in the beginning, but as the movie progressed I really felt inspired by the way this family weathered it together. Awesome movie. Definitely recommend to anyone!"
5,True Fan,I have been a Wake Forest fan for years and remember when this tragic yet inspiring story happened. The movie captures everything so well that you can't help but feel for the Abbate family. It's such a touching story of how someone so young can affect so many people and the obstacles that the family had to overcome. I remember when the crowd would put up 5 fingers at the start of every 4th quarter and how it felt to be a united community around the family. And how the football team came together and were able to overcome the preseason disappointment of being picked to finish last in the conference. This movie is very inspiring and I highly recommend it to anyone. GO DEACS!!
3,"Great songs, but not a very good compilaton","If you buy a greatest hits-package, wouldn't you prefer the songs in their original versions, rather than a mixture of studio and live recordings thrown together?I know I would. Go buy ""Alice Coooper's Greatest Hits"" for the 70s classics, and ""A Fistful Of Alice"" if you want live recordings.I know, you'll be missing some good later stuff, but you can get most of that on ""The Definitive Alice Cooper"" is you don't mind a few overlaps.Wait, this is getting too complicated. Just buy the box set, ""The Life And Crimes Of Alice Cooper"", and have it over with. You know you want to...."
2,OK Album but...,It only includes all the new stuff by alice cooper. Wheres all the good old stuff? All the new stuff on here bassicly is not good except lost in america and than the live versions of the old songs dont even sound good? whats up with that. Dont buy this album buy alice cooper greatest hits instead not this pointless CD. And for 12 bucks its not really worth the money
3,Not all that Classic Alice Cooper,"While I like this CD, I do have two complaints about it. First, it has six live recordings. Second, the ""classics"" are principally live, with Alice Cooper's 80s hits not being live. Unfortunately, if you purchased the much better ""Mascara and Monsters"" CD you will also need this one because it includes several songs that were missed in that collection, particularly ""Hey Stoopid"" and ""Feed My Frankenstein."" Have you ever noticed how many greatest hits collections always seem to miss at least one bona fide hit, which means you have to buy at least two greatest hits collections to get them all. Such is the case with both ""Mascara and Monsters"" and ""Classicks.""I remain a big Alice Cooper fan, but unless you are a fan of live music I would avoid this particular collection. I really did not care for the mixture of live and studio recordings."
5,I just love Alice Cooper,"I would have to say my picks of this CD are ""Poison"", ""Love's a Loaded Gun"", ""House of Fire"", and ""Lost in America"". Cooper delivers pure hard rock with a good rhythm and melody, instead of just a screamfest as so many other metal bands do."
3,Good for those only wanting his better songs,Not being much of an Alice Cooper fan but really liking a few of his songs I found this album satisfied my needs quite well. The huge song Poison is on here along with other great songs. I would have preferred none of them were live and were still originals but the live performances aren't bad.This is the only Alice Cooper album I own and would recommend it for others who just want a few of his good songs.
4,Best of the Late era studio hits and some Live oldies,"Alice Cooper / Classicks: This one has 8 `hits' from Alice's work in the late 1980's to the mid 1990's. The album then has 6 good Live oldies. The whole thing concludes with a cover of Jimi Hendrix's ""Fire"". This CD is worthwhile for the fan of his earlier works (meaning they already have the bands early albums) and who want a fair collection of the later hits (which this CD covers). Overall, this is an interesting collection of songs. Four Stars"
5,excellent,"the whole theme of this album is good,i feel fortunate to have co-written waymores blues with waylon jennings,Curtis Buck"
5,WoW!!! Best album in my collection!!,"I purchased the record album in 1986 when in first came out under the PolyGram label and emediately fell in love with it. Four of my favorite artists on one album. Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy Orbison and Johnny Cash. WoW!!! This album does not dissapoint!!! Especially if you are a Carl Perkins fan. The opening track of 'Birth Of Rock And Roll' is one of Perkins's best vocal outputs. (My opinion as an owner of several of his albums.) Jerry Lee does a great rendition of his old hit 'Sixteen Candles' with his three buddies in support and his 'Keep My Motor Running' is classic Lewis. Cash's old hit 'I Will Rock And Roll With You' has its best rendition ever on this album thanks to the other three singing support. Orbison's voice can be heard in a major supporting role on all the tracks. I own several albums from each of the artists, but this is the one I keep coming back to. D.W.Sullivan, Elbridge, NY"
5,CLASS OF 55,"I OWN ABOUT A 1000 RECORDS AND MORE CDS---COVERING ABOUT 500 YEARS OF DIFFERENT MUSIC---THIS RECORD IS MY FAVORITE: EVEN MORE THAN ""THE MAGIC FLUTE""."
3,"Its ok, somewhat disappointed","Its ok, I just expected more from this.I noticed my MPG went down about 1 mpg vs the stock model that came with the new car.But That could mean that this one is better at filtering more than the stock model. I'm no expert in cars but that could be a possibility. I do know that there is usually a trade-off between filtering and airflow. If I had to do over, I would have gone with the less expensive stock model that kept the MPG were it was as I don't plan on keeping the car well into its prime where the benefits of better filtering would extend the engine life.So if you want MPG, I would recommend something else. But if you plan on keeping the car 10+ years, I think this is a good air filter that could extend the life of the engine."
1,no good on my 06 crv,had put this in for like 10 mos. on my 2006 crv and it plummeted my gas consumption to an avg of 17 mpg.the oem filter atleast was giving me 20.didnt notice any upgrade in driving performance especially on hard throttle.will not buy anymore kn filters as i think it is overhyped especially for honda engines like the crv.
5,good does the job.,"i got this for my civic si ep3 2004 and it does the jobas far performance goes...it makes a bit more sound and throttle response. could be just because it's new...or placebo effecteither way its a new filter and it does the job.its red and looks nice(not that it matter it goes closed in my airbox anyways). comes with stickers....i prefer to get a ""performance"" one for peace of mind that im getting the most out of my car(for a reasonable price), needed a new one anyways. [...] Bucks shipped isnt too bad of a price for that."
3,A must read classic,"It's a true classic that everyone should read at least once. Movies have never really done the book justice. If you are a Prime customer, it's a free read. You can read it on a rainy afternoon."
4,Classic Adventure Read,Great classic read. A well written classic that leaves you entertained. Not as action packed as a modern novel but still worth the read.
5,Amazingly enjoyable - totally modern,"It has been a long time since I last enjoyed reading a ""classic"" as much as this. This novel is superbly put together and completely rewards its status as an all-time classic. At the same time it is the mother of all survival stories of any type - including the so-called ""reality"" TV shows aplenty (which are not reality at all but a twisted form of fiction) - and it is without a doubt still the best. Also this work is surprisingly modern in its style (despite of course its oldish language) and written in a documentary style very much in the way that a modern day journalist would probably do it. It gives the book excellent forward momentum. Last but not least I found this book really funny. I think that's probably because of Defoe's fantastic sense of self-criticism in the narrative . Impressive and worth reading for anyone who likes a good story."
4,A good inventive tale,This is a classic tale that manages to keep moving despite the tendency of similar ones to bog down a little. Do not skip the end as it provides a satisfying and realistic conclusion.
5,Went looking for this.,I love books about being stranded on a deserted island. This was fascinating. Took me some time to get the English down while reading but once I did this book flew by. I loved it.
2,Incorrectly titled,"This titled includes two books, both ""The Life and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, of York, Marine"" and ""The Further Adventures of Robinson Crusoe"". The book is bound as one volume and there was no chapter, volume or any indication that one book had ended and the other began. I found this odd binding to annoying as you are unable to know what you are reading when you are reading it.I would have like to have read ""the Live and strange"", that is the first one book, and not the second. The first book was very interesting and a compelling read. Unfortunately, the second novel was less interesting as it was more focused on conveying an obvious religious message."
2,Robinson Crusoe Review,The book Robinson Crusoe was not even half of what I expected. It was boring and I could not stay focused because of my lack of interest in that type of book. I was very unimpressed. The book moves too slow. Personally I would not recommend this book to someone who likes detail and more action.
1,Good idea but cashing in,"Everybody knows the story (that's why it's a classic) but few normal readers know the real story. Indeed, Crusoe is stranded on an island but, in fact, he uses his middle-class background to attempt to make profit and he ends up owning the island!! Sorry, that ruins the traditional idea of what the novel is about but really it was a way for Defoe to cash in...Robinson Crusoe is also a very boring read (unless you enjoy reading microscopic details of making wheat) because of its language and because nothing much happens and also all the religious stuff. If you're not religious you'll hate this, if you like modern novels you'll hate this - but you still have to appreciate the impact that this novel has had (on the minds of children anyway)."
3,"Holds up well, but ...","Surprisingly accessible for a book of its age.The first part is a conventional coming-of-age story. The second part is immortal: Crusoe shipwrecked alone on an island for years. Crusoe's struggles, mental and physical and spiritual, are detailed and engaging. This is the best part of the book.The third part of the book introduces Friday and his treatment does Defoe no credit at all.And then the novel needs a resolution. Like many people, I knew the shipwrecked-alone part long before I read the book. But I had no idea how the book would end and that helped sustain some tension. However, I must say I was disappointed in the resolution, and have no intention of reading the sequel. So -- a mediocre rating.I see in other reviews that this edition was bowdlerized. That's too bad."
5,A classic for good reason,I recall reading this in grade school but as I re-read it as an adult I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of the character development and the psychological and spiritual insights that Robinson Crusoe reveals through his reflections. Much more that just a remarkable adventure tale and a lesson in self reliance which has become part of literary mythology this story resonates with a man's self discovery under difficult circumstances.While the main outline of the plot is familiar and recognizable there is much to enjoy in the details that make this a book to read again.
3,It was so so,I enjoyed some but thought a lot of it was repeatitive.It was easy too read and held my interest.
3,"A masterpiece of its time, but less accessible now","I can just imagine people sitting around their living rooms listening to someone read this book, chapter by chapter, enthralled at what the main protagonist has to go through, shocked by the appearance of the cannibals, reassured by Friday's conversion to Christianity. It would have been gripping. Ironically, the story arc is slow by today's standards, and dominated by a type of Calvanist theology that is by and large no longer popular. This book is best read with the original readers in mind."
5,A great story,"My dad gave my twelve-year-old nephew a copy of Robinson Crusoe and told him that he ought to read it. My nephew is a reluctant reader and never got very far in the book. After reading it this week, I can see why.Robinson Crusoe was a tough read for me. You know the story, of course. Crusoe, against his parents' wishes, heads out to the sea and ends up a slave. He escapes from slavery only to later return to the sea and become shipwrecked on an island. How he manages to survive is a fun read.And he does survive, despite a lack of water and food and companionship, despite hurricanes, despite cannibals. The daunting vocabulary and a complex sentence structure make this a challenging read for a child."
4,great free book,"good book for an even better price, prime membership pays off really well when I get books as good as this one"
4,What fun!,"Being a girl, I never read this as a child. A very good adventure for children of any age. So glad to get it on my Kindle."
4,Good to watch again!,"Series good to watch a second time, and more. Characters are believable, story line is good. If you like British programs this is for you."
5,Really does work for me,"I have had actual TSH results that have convinced me this product works. May not help everyone, but my levels dropped about 2 points while taking Thyromine along with levothyroxine (Dr. approved it). I stopped the Thyromine for a couple of months to see if there was a difference and started feeling the old symptoms again. Sure enough, my TSH on my next Dr. visit had jumped back up a couple of points. I still need the RX meds, but at a much lower dose in combination with Thyromine - again, with my doctor's approval."
2,Poorly organized information,"This book is almost identical to UFO's over Topanga Canyon by the same author.I found the book to be unorganized and the information to be poorly supported. It just mentions an event with nothing to back it, no scientific proof, no investigation.. something like .. ""Wilma from Long Beach saw a UFO over the ocean.""So what? Big deal!! Very disapointing.I would NOT buy this again."
4,More Going On In California Than Most Other Sources Let On,"Mr. Dennett has compiled what is possibly the most exhaustive list of California sightings to date. Not that I can agree with the sources of origin, after years of reading volumes of literature, and a past involvement with occultic practices. My conclusion is they're all from the same source. Read my other reviews on the paranormal to see what that source is. But for the sheer history of occurrences in the state, in a league of its own."
3,Good Selection,"If you are a camp coach, or a coach/leader of any kind who is leading a large group of motivated kids, this book is great. If you are looking for something for a smaller group (10 or less) then look elsewhere. Teachers who have 30 students or so should get this book."
4,Garmin Motorcycle Mount for Zumo series,"bought as additional mount for my other M/C. What you see is what you get.Like others, thought cable might be included. (yea, right) Cheaper to purchase both together & save if you need a cable too. Garmin box included tiny screws for mounting wire plug and the four larger SS bolts and nuts for mounting your ball swivel or other attachment. Yes, the tiny special-cut security screwdriver was included too. 5 stars if the cable came with it...are you listening Garmin? didn't think so"
3,Not very watertight.,"I got caught in a rainstorm yesterday while on a motorcycle ride. Zumo 550 started popping error messages such as ""device not connected"" etc. Finally got the ""Continue on battery power?"" message. No longer any power from the hardwired connection to the bike's system. I traced the fault to the cradle; the power lead was still hot and properly grounded. Removed and disassembled the cradle-a lot of water inside which had apparently shorted something out the circuit board in the cradle. Tried drying it out, but it was completely dead. No choice but to buy a new one. Dialectric grease on everything."
3,My old one WAS bad,"I have owned my Zumo 550 for seven or eight years. I am not sure why the old mount went bad, but this piece corrected the problem."
4,Replacement,"This is a replacement for the original cradle that came with my Zumo 550. The electrical contact pins at the bottom seem to be a problem. One of them froze and one broke off, rendering the GPS inoperable."
5,Just what I needed.,"The Garmin motorcycle mounting bracket for Zumo is just what I needed for mounting on my motorcycle. Combined with the power cable for Zumo 550 as well as other mounting parts, this system provides direct power and up-front viewing of the Zumo."
1,WRONG BRACKET FOR 2820,Don't order this item. It is for the Zumo GPS and NOT the 2820 or any other StreetPilot series units.
4,Not bad for the price,"Not a bad stand by any means for the price if you use a cartridge razor. I use this with a steel Atra handle, Sensor Excel and a Trac II handle and works perfectly. If you are worried about your brush not being wide enough, it can be pried open or closed with a little elbow grease. Just be wary, I use this with a Rooney 1/1 brush and the brush tends to tilt a little when in the stand. Not the end of the world but not as nice looking."
2,Never seen the boots!,I ordered these boots as a part of a party costume (NCIS's Abby Sciuto). I placed the order a week earlier and payed for express shipping as I was not willing to take any chances. But apparently that was not enough...they mixed up my order and sent it by ground!!! I received the package 10 days after I ordered it and shipped it back without even giving a look a it. So I'll not be able to provide a review of the item itself but their customer service was so apologetic and efficient after the fact that they earned at least 2 stars.
5,Because Garth finally gets his football phone,"Waynestock?! Christopher Walken? Asian acting legend James Hong? What more can you ask for in a sequel! Wayne's World 2 is a must see, and a must have. Zang!"

5,ALZ Book,Excellent information for caregiver's to find out how the disease is affecting the perspective of the person they are caring for.
5,Exceptional Read,"This is an excellent book to help those of us who have a loved one with Alzheimers better understand the thoughts, feelings, concerns and fears of a person dealing with the disease. We need to have so much compassion for the victims of this disease. Wonderful book!"
4,Alzheimer's from the Inside Out,"This book gives a unique perspective on the feelings of the person with Alzheimer's disease. Examining how it feels to be ignored by family and doctor's as if they are not in the room as they are discussed. It is a good book for families and other caregivers to read as it can help them understand some of the behaviors that the person with Alzheimer's disease exhibit, especially fear, anger, outrage, embarrassment, etc., often they cannot explain these reactions in words and thus act out their feelings. This book helps the caregiver understand this better and helps them to see that a change in their behavior might improve their loved one's behavior."
2,"Critical of Jesus, disturbing comparision!!",Right off the author critizes the writers of the New Testament. What does faith have to do with this book??? He puts down the Bible as contradicting. His book is only his perspective!!! I really did not like it at all.
5,"Tough Licks, once mastered...plays amazing","This book, at first looks the same as any other tab book out there. Once you look at the songs and get all the little licks in (and there are tons of little intricate notes in there) it will just sound awesome. Its no wonder he plays with Tim all alone a lot of the time...His guitar music is enough and put it with his vocals...You have something really strong. Five stars."
4,DMB,"Great book for DMB fans - not easy. He tends to make up chords and his riffs are usually very fast but it sounds perfect and if you get a song right, you can't beat it."
5,WONDERFUL,"Anything on dave matthews band is spectacular, this book gives a lot of information and was pleasurable and fun to read."
4,Really Quite Impressed...,"This is my first Skunk Anansie CD, and compared to there new Cd's, it's still pretty good. It's obvious that the band has evolved but we love them all the same. The best songs on the Cd are ""Selling Jesus"", ""Intellectualize my Blackness"", ""Little baby Swastikkka"", and ""Weak"". Weak is by far the best song... I love it.. I find that they have a morcheeba sound with a Rage against the Machine Singer... It's great to hear something so new.."
3,Not all I expected,"Good points are that it is heavy duty, and has some need functions like keeping tally of the amount deposited.Bad points are that all though it is heavy duty the register door where you retrieve your money is kind of flimsy, the bank is a lot smaller than I thought it would be (my own fault for not paying attention to the dimensions), the bank only tallies nickels, dimes, and quarters (pennies and bills are not included, though you can deposit them through a slot in back of machine). Also the balance only shows upto $10.00, and I don't think it completely unlocks unless the balance reads exactly $0.00.I really like the product, it was just not all that I expected.Probably my fault for not reading the details better."

4,This music is part of my life,"Buying this particular version of the Faure' when it was originally released on vinyl makes me very happy. I like the full orchestrated version of this masterpiece and it always inspires me. I have to agree with composer Virgil Thompson when he said that he may not have been a greatly religious person, but he loved religious music. This is a wonderful release to get if this music is just starting to be a part of your life and much better than the ""greatest hits"" packages of part of vocal masterpieces such as this.Craig"
2,Am I Hearing the Same Recording?,This is a marginal recording of a less-than-stellar performance. A waste of eight dollars. The choir perfoms these works with casual cut-offs and entrances. And the orchestra is a little over-the-top. The recording is overmodulated in places.
1,Absolutely horrible!,"Absolutely horrible! The worst $20 I've every spent. This machine is an absolute waste of money. I have had this machine fore 2 weeks and still have not found a cup small to fit it, they are all either too wide or too tall. A total headache when your rushing out to work."
1,worked well... for a week,"This product worked great for a week. Then, I couldn't get it to turn on. The instructions say to call the manufacturer in the case of problems, so I did so. They told me to press the button really really hard. I pressed it as hard as I could but it would not turn on. Then they said to submit my information (proof of purchase, nature of the problem, etc) to get a new version of the coffee maker which does not have this problem. So, I did so and got a brand new coffee maker. I never got bad service from the seller or the manufacturer, but this product was really sub-standard."
3,Its okay,I liked this initially when I bought it because you can use a regular size cup and you can use ground coffee instead of the pods (though they are much easier). But it stopped working and I can't find another one to replace it. I had to go to the 4-cup coffee maker.
3,good coffee but......,"I just got it today and I don't have any pods yet but I am glad it comes with a filter to use your own coffee. It works great but it takes 3.5 minutes to make a cup which I can live with but my biggest disappointment is that it only holds 4"" high cups. Most of my cups a 4.5"". Check your cup size you have if this isimportant to you."
1,"This book is pro-Stalinist, postmodern nonsense.","Kotkin has tried to do too much with this book. What could have been an excellent history of the making of Magnitogorsk becomes an overdrawn, theoretically flawed attempt to make insights of questionable value. The heavy reliance on Foucault leads nowhere (as all work based on Foucault's writings does), and results in some ridiculous and useless speculations which I don't even want to entertain. The main premise is that in spite of the fact that Stalinism resulted in the death of millions, it was still progressive and forward-looking throughout. Go figure...."
5,My all-time favorite book!,"When I was a little girl, I would go stay with my Granny each summer. A reader, Granny had lots of books, and I loved to read them. One old book was called ""More Tish"", by Mary Roberts Rinehart. I loved that book and read it every summer while I was at Granny's. I have been searching for the others in the series for years. I still have that old book--its pages are yellow and crackling with age, but it remains my all-time favorite book! I love Tish and her buddies, and have laughed aloud many times while reading their exploits!"
3,"Good product, would be better with customer service","I like the product. It's easy to use, and well thought out. For me, the accuracy is very good. In a paragraph, I might get several errors, but it's much easier than typing. Also, as I use it, it seems that my accuracy improves. And the current price is very attractive.My only complaint is with customer service. I sent them a question -- a fairly simple and straightforward question -- and never heard back from them. Were there any customer service for this product, I would rate it 4 stars."
4,Great scanner for the money...,"I'd like it better if it handled scanning handwriting better... but, it works wonderfully for my husband's needs (the person it was bought for). He uses it to scan names and such off of forms he is handed by customers relating to products to be handled for them. From there, he is trying to get it where he can send the data from the cpen to his handheld pc. But, in the meantime, has no trouble sending it to his laptop and desktop computers. It is decently accurate, and allows editing to be done while the data is still in the cpen."
1,Can't get it to sync,I have not been able to connect the C-Pen to my computer(Compaq Presario). The Laptop doesn't have a com port so I had to use Keyspan but still the C-pen was unable to sync. I Email to the address on the brochure still nothing works. I took my Laptop to CompUSA and they couldn't get it to sync to the C-pen. After approx. $100.00 and many months later I still cannot use the product. I need it to work to help me with my school work.Rose
5,must have for all students,This thing is great. Works right out of the box. No more messing up books with highlighters... scan what is important and be able to have your own study guide ready for you next test. Great for research papers too. Save tuns of money not having to use the copy machine. Wish I would have found out about this little thing sooner.
5,Very durable,Very impressed on how durable it is. My two year old like to play with it and is learning numbers and letters. This is a great educational toy.
3,Princess Laptop A Bit Primitive.....,"We bought the laptop for our 5 year old and it seems to be too easy for her. The ages said 4-8 so I thought that it would be a good fit. I should have read the reviews first because most people bought it more for a toddler (ages 2-4). It's cute and she played with it once or twice, but she even told me that it was kind of easy for her. Oh well, I'm going to pass it down to my younger niece..."
3,Fun Game but could be more educational,"We bought this because we found excellent deal on it and it is fun to play with. If you're looking for the eductational experience, you can do better with other items such as Leapfrog's Leapad's becuase you can buy add'l books for it. Here's my issue's on the education aspect:#1 - They put capital letters on the keypad. Lower case letters are just as important if not more important for kids to learn to recoginize.#2 - They put more emphasis on the name of letters than learing letter sound. ex. It asks to locate a letter by saying the name of a letter. There's no funtion that says something like ""locate the letter that has the sound of ""pa"" (for P).So, in my opinion it's fun to play with but could use more games and work more with the letter sound and lower case letters."
4,Disney's Laptop by LeapFrog,"My daughter Lily got this for her 3rd birthday. We have always loved LeapFrog products. This was her favorite present, hands down. My 6 and 9 year olds even love it! I am really impressed by how many things it does. After playing with it for a day Lily can identify some letters and numbers. The music is great, and I LOVE that there is a high low switch, making it a quiet toy as well as a learning toy!"
4,Laptop,I bought this product for my 2 year olds birthday. She loves it. It was the only toy she had to have out of the package right then. She loves it and I love all the things she will learn from it. Its great to hear her sing the ABC song along with the laptop.
1,Misleading Title,"Buyer Beware - Misleading TitleOnly 10 pages of this 240-page book are devoted to a description of gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors and are quoted verbatim from the National Cancer Institute's Web site, CANCERNET/PDQ for patients! Patients who live with a very rare cancer, carcinoid/neuroendocrine tumors, are deceived when they see the title of this book and think they may find answers to the many questions they have regarding the management of their disease. Additionally, nearly 90% of the references in the abstracts that are quoted refer to colorectal cancers, which are totally different from GI carcinoid cancer.In no way does this book focus on carcinoid and neuroendocrine tumors nor does it present information that cannot be found elsewhere at no charge. The title does not match the content!The Official Patient's Sourcebook On Gastrointestinal Carcinoid Tumors (2004)$41.25-Paperback - ISBN: 0597841918 | Lightning Source Inc | 2004-03-31 | Revised Edition"
5,Amazing Album,"I first heard of Ludo when I went to a concert in St. Louis five years ago and somone was handing out demos for their first album. I loved them instantly and it really helped that they came to Columbia, MO a lot so we could watch them. They put on a great show and their first album was fantastic so when I heard they were putting out a new album I couldn't wait to hear it and when I put it in I was really surprised. It was nothing like I thought it would be... it was better! I'd recommend this CD to anyone out there. It's fantastic and they did a GREAT job!"
5,Superb. Simply superb.,"I've never really listened to Ludo before. I'd heard ""Love Me Dead"" a few times on WRRV, and finally I decided to look them up. I saw the fan videos for all but Part III on Youtube, and now I can not wait to buy the EP (which I'm doing in precisely a minute) to hear it in order; in it's entirety. It's an excellently emotional rock-opera, and it definitely deserves the five star rating, maybe even more.""Save Our City/Keep Our Souls Lord/Through The Rapture of This World."""
5,Totally Frightening,"When I got Silent Hill for Playstation, I knew I was going to like it, but I didn't expect it to be so scary! The opening was really cool. It got the scariest when I got to the school and little zombie children were chasing me around with knifes.I played this game with the lights off and I slept with the lights on. This game is about a normal man named Harry, who is looking for his missing daugther Cheryl in a town called Silent Hill I think that this game is not for the queasy at heart, this game contains scenes of violent images and has a lot of jumpy parts.Unlike Resident Evil, which I do love too, the control are not awful, and Harry is just a regular guy, with no experience with a gun, and he has no idea what is going on, which makes it 10 times scarier than ANY Resident Evil game. I think if you want a game as close to a horror movie as possible, this is the game for you. Go buy it when you can."
4,THIS GAME IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY,"I am a 14 year old gamer, and I had heard about this game in a magazine and thought I wouldn't get that scared. I never get scared at movies, and I am not afraid of the dark. After playing less than 1 hours worth of the game, I don't think I'll ever walk around the house without a baseball bat and all the lights turned on.(okay it wasn't that bad) I wanted to be scared, and I definently got that (that is why it deserves 4 stars)Althought this game is very well done, it is VERY DISTURBING. Don't play this unless you want to be paranoid for the next month (and that example is for those who don't get scared at movies). But if you still don't belive me that something like a video game can be that scary, then I dare you to play it. Good luck."
4,Don't play this game after midnight.,"The first day I got this game, I played it until way after midnight. Paranoia and fear don't begin to describe what this game gave me that night. If you love to be scared, this is your game."
4,Creepy and Disturbing,"Zombie Babies!..Zombie Babies!, its what makes the game tick. The controls were ""sloppy"", but, i really didnt mind cause the graphics were awsome. One of my favorites i really enjoyed."
3,"SCARY! But all in all, just an OK game","Everyone is right - it is NOT Resident Evil, but then again what is? This game is pretty easy, straight forward and repetitive. But is has some VERY SCARY scenes, to the point I jump up and scream (yes guys, I am a chick!).My suggestion: Rent it. You can probably complete it in a 5 day rental and never need to play it again."
3,Caution: Very Disturbing Images,"While I was excited and intrigued about the 3-D world of Silent Hill and the promise of alternate endings based on strategy, I put the game down after about 30 minutes of play and have not played it since. Be aware that the images are disturbing...so disturbing that I'm not so sure any of us should feel good about tuning them out. Mutilated body parts, blood, gore, mutant baby-things that bite and kill....why is anyone comfortable with this? Pass this one by."
1,umm....WHATTTT,so...im lookin at this...and i see a pic of a boatWHAT THE HELL DOES A BOAT HAVE TO DO WITH THIS GAMEi hate boats...i was gonna but a new sealed copy.....now i wont cuz of this boatthanks
4,the greatest game!!,"Silent Hill is the best game out there. It's pretty scary, but nothing compared to the second and third ones! This one was the best of the series, and after completing it i had to get the second and thrid ones as well! Silent Hill is very addicting! I am anxiously awaiting Silent Hill 4 and Silent Hill the movie!It has mysterious people, creepy monsters, and a very interesting storyline! I would give this game a 5 star rating any time."
5,Silent Hill - Spooky ooky,"This is quite possibly the most creepiest game ever! Well, it is the most creepiest I have ever played.. The ultra-realistic graphics, amazing CG sequences, spooky ooky musick, and overall feeling to this is truly *evil*! I have played this many many times, and it never gets boring.. and plus, it has great re-play value, not to mention the mega-kool *Alien* ending! ^_^ This is a must for all hardcore gamers..Pros: -Realistic grapics- Creepy musick- Great replay value- Great storylineCons:- NONE!"
5,Brilliant and Chilling,"Oh my god, this game was scary! The designers did a brilliant job in setting up a sort of drowning, oppressive atmosphere of fear and darkness. I played this game with the lights off, and couldn't get to sleep until I turned the lights on that night!The graphics, while a bit grainy, support the dreamlike state of this game. The lighting effects used were simply superb.And the sound is the clincher. There isn't any real music to speak of, just the background sounds of a nightmare world. This even furthers the creeping dark that pervades every scene in this game.The plot, while confusing, is very intricate and extremely brilliant. I asked an English grad student to play this game once, and we talked about the story...there are so many complex layers, it could easily the plot of a well written horror novel.I loved it!"
5,1farmboy@comcast.net,"This is the original horror game of all time,not to own this is a want to be gamer. The rest of the gaming industry can only hope to match the silent hill fans.Also a real horror gamer,such as myself, will, have the whole collection.I would not part with them for ANY PRICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thanks for completing my set! [...]"
5,This is the most freightening game i have ever played-period,"Silent Hill is just one of those games that does jsut what its meant to do - scare the heck out of you! From the environments to the monsters, and especially the music and noises. I have played many so called horror-survival games and this is by far the scariest. I love a good scare,but this game takes it a step further. Playing at nightime just doubles the terror. Its great!I recomend this game to anyone who enjoys scary games or survival horror. This game will not let you down, and when your done playing, it wont let you sleep."
4,cracked case,i recieved the game really fast. there was a crack on the case though the copy i bought was really cheap so 4/5
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,"Do not waste your money buying this game. The game ends up being very boring and dull. All you do is run around in circles half the time and getting nowhere but fustrated. And I know there were a couple of times when a creepy critter would come out of the ceiling and make me jump a little, but that's certainly not worth what this game costs."
1,A bad forgery of Resident evil,"Iv'e had Silent Hill for about a year and beaten the game and obtained all of the endings,but this game just plain sucks! The controlls are horribal and you have to use a flash light for most of the game! Even when youre not in total darkness you can only see about 6 feet in front you! Now I'm a huge Resident evil series fan and I would definitly choose resident evil over this game. One of the most disturbing thing about this bad excuse for a game is that they have nude zombie children that stab you with kitchen nives what the hell is up with that? If you want a good horror game get ant of the residnent evil series EXCEPT THE FIRST ONE."
1,Ultra lame!,"I love video games, especially when they're creepy...but this game just bites. The game play is lame, the characterization is less than interesting and all you do is run around for ever and nothing interesting happens. I say if you want a good game...don't buy this one."
5,Scary!,"For its time, this was the scariest video game ever made. Probably still is, although the graphics don't hold up. Still, if you like the older games, this one is worth checking out."
2,great cover,"the cover is great but was not too impressed with the contents, you cant judge a book by its cover is very true"
5,Why didn't I have this before,"I wish I had had this book in my hands when I walked into the showroom to buy my last car! For some reason, independent, self assured professional woman that I am, I wound up somewhat timid/intimdated at the dealership.I had followed commandments two and three on finance and model. Yes, I had purchased Car and Driver and Road and Track and surfed the web. I was downright excited about the car I wanted. Then, I might as well have been going to the dentist.Commandmants 5, 7 and 8 are key. Number Seven was humbling. As a former senior negotiator for the US government, I should have known better.Highly readable - laugh out loud - at moments. The perfect Mothers/Fathers Day or Graduation gift."
5,How to be a savvy car shopper- brilliant behind the scenes of how a dealership operates!!,It's a fun read. All car shoppers as well as anyone facing a purchasing negotiation can benefit from this book. It offers precise tips on how to avoid common pitfalls and get the best deal possible in any car purchase or lease situation. It's also a great read and a facinating tour of how a car dealership operates. It took us forever to decide whether to buy or lease until we read this book!
1,Not what I expected...,"A light psychological pep talk, the book wasn't what I expected. The information wasn't substantive enough on its own to go in and negotiate a good deal.It was also disturbing to find typographical errors - in fact two on the same page in the section where the author compares car-buying and prostitution.Some might disagree, but I found the book to be a waste of time and money. It might provide an ""atta girl"" nudge to the truly trepidatious (which I found pretty insulting as a woman considering the number of books out there trying to convince us we can do it rather than showing us how to get it done.)"
4,A really great way to get started learning philosophy,"If you want to introduce anyone you know into philosophy, this is a great book to do it with. If you know nothing about philsophy, read this book! It is a great primer or introduction to Western philosophy including much of Christian philosophy as well. Plato introduces us to Socrates, as well as the idea of Absolute Good which early Christian philosophers connected with God. Plato also introduces us to the idea that the reason why people do wrong is because they don't know what is right. To know the good is to do the good Plato argues, and whether you agree with him or not, it's certainly a good place to start understanding what is right and what is wrong. A great primer on western philosophy and western knowledge. I highly recommend giving this book to yourself and all your friends, anyone you want to see enlightened."
2,Hardly worth the money or effort!,"This book was so poorly organized! I didn't find what I was looking for, and the ""illustrations"" are Xerox copies of maps or sculpture pictures. The sentences were boring, and there were spelling and punctuation errors. Overall, the information could have been presented in a much more concise and effective way."
4,Not as good as the OT Apoc-Pseudo.,"I bought this NT Apocrypha maybe 9 months ago or so and found it very complete and adequate. My first work with it was concerning the infancy legends of Jesus. I planned to buy the 2 OT vols. and have a whole set. Well, today I recieved the OT vols. and WOW! Impressive appartaus notes with lexiographical and source-crit info. Now I wish my NT one was like the OT ones. The OT books are much larger, basically twice the size. So they won't really look like they are a set on the shelf, but no matter. Still, this volume is very affordable and complete and helps unravel some of the inspirations for historical and even modern day pseudo-Christian cults."
2,cheap Chinese copy,"Fortunately I got my Konus 200 from a reputable telescope store. They were using it on the sales floor as an example of a bad scope that you should not waste your money on. The scope itself is a cheap toy on a wobbly mount. The mount is so loose with so much backlash in the gears it cannot be used for photography. I bought it with the intention to rebuild the mount as a hobby project. The scope itself performs surprisingly well for how poorly it was made. But it does live down to its poor reputation of being difficult to focus. So for backyard fun in poor viewing conditions I love the toy. But if you want a real telescope, double what you were wishing to pay, and go Orion, Parks, Celestron, etc. and leave the toys behind."
4,"Classic study. Somewhat dated methods for web development, but good foundation.","This book is a classic on one of the earliest efforts to collect software metrics. It's getting a bit dated for today's webdev efforts, but still worth a read to understand how we got where we are today."
5,sure fire sure shot,"This is an excellent product. The shot is split cleanly and evenly, which helps to maintain the balance of tackle particularly whilst float fishing. The shape seems shape consistent throughout the pack. I would recommend this product, and the other sizes available, as a good buy."
2,NOT the Actual Game,This is a 55 minute documentary about the season leading up to Superbowl XXIII. The game summary never mentioned Tim Krumrie's game changing injury or the 49ers' amazing defensive stand when the Bangals had 1st & Goal inside the 5 and walked away without scoring. This is one of my most disappointing purchases - especially considering the product description at the time explicitly stated that it was the actual game.
5,Up Periscope has elements similar to The Survivor...,"but they are definitely two separate books.Both are highly enjoyable.Up Periscope has a somewhat different perspective, in that it portrays a little bit more of what life on board a WW2 diesel boat in the Pacific Theatre was like. Readers who enjoy this aspect of the book would also doubtless enjoy 'Run Silent, Run Deep,' by Capt. Edward Beach.Robb White had the gift of economy of words. With a very few short sentences, he is able to evoke powerful feelings and emotions. His books truly set the standard in the 'coming of age' style of books in the 60's.We need more writers like him.His wife, Annie White, runs a publishing company in LA. Her only purpose is to get more of his books back into print. So far, she has succeded with just the two books currently available- 'Deathwatch,' and 'Lions Paw.' Lets hope she gets more out soon.There are a lot of kids who would benefit from reading these books."
5,Another Robb White Classic,"Like many people of my generation, I encountered the classic adventure novels of Robb White in the early 1960s. Children's novels??? I'm 41 now and I still don't see it. White's tales of straightforward courage and selflessness are better than most ""adult"" fiction I read nowadays. UP PERISCOPE is one of his best story's, and, in case no one remembers, was made into a competent little war movie of the same name in the late 50s starring a young James Garner. Great book, as are all White's heartfelt WWII-era tales. Like the rest of Robb White's legions of fans, most of whom were Eisenhower-era kids when they read him, I'll never forget his wonderful, wonderful stories. I guess that's as close to immortality as a man can get."
5,Great option,"Having built a new router table to replace an aging one, I had purchased a router lift that required the PC 7518. The problem was a new 7518 router, even on sale, was about $350. I checked with all local tool dealers and they actually wanted more for the motor alone, than they did for a whole new router. Only needing the motor I found this on Amazon for about $100 off the price of the whole router. It came in three days and ran just as advertised. Mounted in my new Woodpecker router lift it became one of those, ""where have you been all my life"" moments."
4,second one was better,"The Porter Cable router motor took about 10 days to get here, and when I opened the box the motor was not in a Porter Cable box it was loose in a freud box and not even in a plastic bag. So some of the packing was in and around the inside of the fan motor, and also the power cord was cut by the motor moving around in the box. The second one was better but the switch and the strainrelief was not the same as the first motor. I hope the second one is a new motor."
1,dont bother,"Assumed it was the router to buy, but the runout at the collet was so bad, my table started walking away with the router on. With a 3"" bit, runout was at .015""."
3,Porter-Cable 75182 Router Motor from Amazon,"I purchased this unit since I wanted just a router motor for the Woodpecker 350 router lift. Unfortunately, the motor was much too large to fit the lift mechanism, so I had to purchase a complete 690 router and return this router motor. The smaller router fit great when the base was removed. I have a hunch that this router motor would be okay when in the proper base from my experience with the 690."
4,Franco Corelli is Calaf,"I had the privilege of seeing Franco Corelli as Calaf during his last years at the Met, and believe me, he spoils you for all other Calafs. Yes, the cover photo shows him in a different costume than this production, but what of that? This is an old B&W production, made for Italian television, with old technology, so don't expect the expanse and color of the Met or the visual clarity and camerawork of a good modern production. But it is wonderful to hear and interesting to watch (what ""Turandot"" isn't at least somewhat imaginative?), but above all, it is carried by the magnificent voice and carriage of the tenor that could sell ""Nessun Dorma"" like no other. He looks the part; he acts the part; and his ringing high notes can make you weak in the knees. I don't mean to give the sopranos short shrift, either - they are both excellent. At any rate, if you love this opera, give it a try."
4,Puccini-Turandot-Corelli,"Corelli's performance in Turandot is nothing short of a masterpiece. Unbelivable vocal quality combines with superb acting makes this DVD a must for every collector. Despite being slightly dark, the video incompasses the best of what Turandot can be. A professional, steller production at every level with th ""cast"" delivering an excellent counterpoint to Corelli's legendary performance."
3,Turandot,"I was disappointed with the darkness of the video. It is very difficult to see what's going on. And the picture on the DVD cover is not the costume, makeup or even age of Franco Corelli shown in this version of Turandot. I did enjoy the music, but a CD would have been just as good."
4,Clinical Laboratory Science Review,This book provides a comprehensive review of the clinical lab. In encompasses both basic and more difficult questions and provides with a thorough explanation of the answers.
5,Best cartoon ever!!,Hands down the most enjoyable and exciting cartoon series Ive ever watched.. Great stories.. Great characters... Cant wait to watch the rest of it!!
4,Double perspective,"This is a great series that I really enjoyed watching. My only comment is that the manufacturers decided to split season 1 into two sets. Most series are able to accomodate entire seasons into one set so it would seem the motive was purely for profit. Despite the annoying business aspect of this product, I do recommend the series."
5,Equal writing!,"This episode follows the new girls of the young justice out on an all girls mission. But without it being a ""slumber party"" so to speak. The girls even bring up the fact, after nightwing justifies the all girl group, that he wouldn't have had to justify it if they were all boys. The episode continues on as any other young justice episode, expect we're following all the girls. Good writing, this isn't your stereotypical girl power episode. The writers didn't treat the fact that they were all female team as an excuse to dumb down the writing.I appreciate the fact that young justice has been bringing the females into the spot light without saying ""LOOK THE GIRLS ARE THE ONES IN CHARGE! GIRL POWER!"" In this episode and the previous. They are treated as equals. Just doing what they are suppose to be doing, their gender isn't a plot point."
2,Missing a Crucial Episode,"Don't know if it's Amazon or if it's the production/distribution of WB, but this episode like edited versions of many other Prime Video Series (Pysch season 6). Is a major let down, before you purchase a series it should be divuldged that some episodes won't be allowed to download, or will only download the edited for t.v. versions, and then let you decide if you still want to purchase the series. I am very disappointed that I cannot finish the Darkest, Before the Dawn (NOT AVAILABLE??) Two parter, but have been charged for the episode that follows. This is bogus, and not an issue solely found on Amazon, other streaming services I have also practice this underhanded policy. Two star rating is because the series is awesome."
2,The kids always has a low self-esteem issue,"If I was granted super powers the first thing is to practice and master the skill as I grow older, not be a crybaby at every situation that comes up. and the story lines for each character is boring and a waist of time. More action and less talking is a tip for future episodes."
5,great series!,"Excellent series,but now since they are going to end it i wonder how they are going to conclude the current arc"
5,Don't let this be Cancelled,So many of us buy this amazing series here on Amazon. It has in depth storylines and great acting. It is one of the best shows on tv.
3,"Great Poetry, Questionable Publishing","First off, I'd like to say that the poetry in this volume is not to be missed. However, I would suggest obtaining this particular set of poetry from a different publisher. This particular book does not have a table of contents...for a 300 some odds pages filled with 3 to 5 page pieces with no particular theme to tie them together. There is are two indexes in the back by all of the titles and first lines, respectively. But this is only marginally helpful.That said. The actual contents of the book is superb. The poetry is elaborate yet fast paced. A lot of biblical references, but not-surprisingly-in a religious sense. That may be why it was so controversial at the time of its release.I highly recommend Swinburne, but not this particular book."
1,This is not a real tasting spoon.,"A real tasting spoon has a grove between the 2 ends. You scope up the liquid in one end, let it flow down the grove to the other end where you taste it. This way you can taste the liquid multiple times with one spoon and not get your germs in the liquid."
5,Excellent quality,"Solid, good rich color, adequate grip and very easy to manage. I only wish that the larger end of the spoon were a bit bigger."
1,Not worth it.,"I usually love the Mario Batali products. This tasting spoon, however, makes everything taste like wood, not what you are tasting. I learned in cooking school, the best tasting spoon is an old fashion flatware one!"
4,First book I've ever finished and immediately reread,"Having once lived in those inpenetrable laurel and rhododendron forests, Frazier's writing always makes me wax nostalgic. He perfectly captures the sounds, smells and smoky vistas I remember. His prose is of the highest order. The book slowed a bit in the middle and the protagonist got a bit too self-absorbed. Still, I think that was the point of the narrative. While the protagonist, Cooper, was a highly intelligent man, he was also a womanizing bum. In our twilight years, missed opportunity seems to loom large in our ruminations. I can't speak for the author, but I think that was one of his main points. Books like this should be sipped like fine wine, or as Cooper would surely prefer, like an Islay single-malt. Peaty scotches aren't everyone's cup of tea and neither is Frazier's style. I find them equally intoxicating."
4,Thirteen Moons better than reviews,"The early reviews knocking Thirteen Moons were off the mark. I think the reviewers did not understand the culture of the times and simply missed many of the subtle points Frazier makes. Sort of like a non-golfer reviewing a golf book and missing the point of ""chunking a shot""."
4,Fully enjoyed this book,Interesting story about a unique character during a tumultuous period in American history. Historical fiction for those interested in the American Indian.
1,Book would not download,"I truly enjoy the rapid dowloading of books to my Kindle. I've purchased, downloaded, and read many books this way. But this book would not download, no matter what I tried and even with the assistance of live tech support. If anyone can tell me how to unlock this book, I would love to read it because I've already paid for it."
3,Somewhat disappointed.,"This is a good and interesting book, but........ Hmm, maybe I expected too much, after long anticipating a second book from Mr. Frasier."
2,Not Worth the Wait or the Read,"I so looked forward to this novel after including ""Cold Mountain"" among the best books I have ever read. ""Thirteen Moons"" is a yawner and a major disappointment from an author who brought us so much with his first novel. ""Cold Mountain"" the film did not come close to capturing the essence of Frazier's words, so don't judge that book by the film. I waded through 400+ pages of ""Thirteen Moons"" and waited for something to catch my imagination and interest. It never happened. The love story? - In a strange way, it reminded me of Harry Chapin's classic ""Taxi,"" but again, Chapin did a far better job of touching my heart than Frazier did. Unfortunately for Frazier, there are far too many more novels worth reading to come even close to moving ""Thirteen Moons"" onto the 'must read' list."
2,Not up to expectation.,"After Cold Mountain I was sure that Thirteen Moons would be my read of the year. Unfortunately, it fell extremely short of being even a good read. I couldn't wait for it to be finished. I think the author attempted to be too sophisticated and svelte to really convey what should have been a heart-tugging and compassionate telling of the plight of the Indian Nation of the Smokey Mountains, especially the Cherokee. I felt he was writing more for an R Rated Hollywood script potential than for a much anticipated follow-on to Cold Mountain, an outstanding book by the way. Could have been another Cold Mountain but ended up, for me, a cold turkey."
3,Very Strange Book,"Wonderful prose which keeps you reading. The storyline is very weak, unless you don't know the history of the Cherokee removal. Very evocotive of the area near the Smokies."
4,Historical Fiction Beautifuly Written,"As a person currently trying to find the ancestral roots of my family, I was enthralled with the story. Will's story could well be that of my own great-great grandfather who lived during that time and in that area of North Carolina. He was also a shop keeper. The story of the Cherokee of that area could well be my own. I loved the book."
2,First half okay,"The first half was pretty good, the second half was not. Is this what you get when a successful author (Cold Mt.) gets paid in advance for a second novel. (Shades of Sarah Gruen & Ape House)."
2,Who the hell is Claire?,"a mysterious girl named Claire.... we never found out who she is, whatmakes her tick... is it possible Mr.Frasier had no idea either?"
1,Totally agree,"Yes, I like Cold Mountain"", yadayada, but I found this the worst drag of reading I have experienced in a long time. I read 350 pages out of 400 and just closed it once and for all. There is totally nothing to this book other rambling and poor characterizations. The author rode his reputation into this book and ultimately damaged it in the end."
1,Production problems,I recieved two copies of this book. All pages on both books were not cut correctly leaving and uneven set of pages showing. I was told (by Amazon) not to send the first book back because of the frieight costs. However the second copy arrived with the same problem. I have now been told that the further charges are due. I have responded advising i don't want the books and will send them back at your cost. Please sort this out. Will you repay the return frieght if i send them back?
1,Capitalization,"Doesn't Charles Frazier know that the first letter of every important word in a title should be capitalized? If he's making basic capitalization errors on the cover, well that doesn't give me much faith in what's inside. I'll bet it's pretty lousy. I say this is a terrible book."
1,How about a zero star rating!,"Very disappointing and BORing! NO likeable characters, VERY uninteresting story. Could/Would not finish--too many ""better"" books waiting."
4,thirteen Moons,"Very well written,. However the writing is sometimes hard to follow at times, causing the reader to wonder who is talking and when. A good read and a book that causes one to pause about the treatment of people different from us."
3,Nice....but,"I finish every book I start, but this book I found nice....but long and it moves very slowly. I've lost interest and probably won't finish it."
2,I'm sorry but I'm sooooo bored,I've read all the glowing reviews here and I will say that I loved Cold Mountain. I'm only 1/2 way through Thirteen Moons and I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to finish it. It is so boring that I read pages and pages and realize that I have no idea what I've just read! It might as well be a book on economic theory for all the pleasure it is giving me.
5,Thirteen Moons,"Frazier's characters are so real in their actions and intentions that you feel you know them like your own relatives once you finish the book.The story, which seems a little less important than the person telling it, winds around the characters as they travel along their individual paths and the paths can only be understood in the light of the intentions and failings of the characters.This is superb literature"
3,Thirteen Moons,Excellent rendition of the sad and frustrating enforced reduction of the Cherokee nation and the powerlessness of those people.Love story a bit unbelievable and annoying at times.
2,lovetoread,"I didn't like Thirteen Moons as much as I liked Cold Mountain and Nightwoods, however the story was good, and interesting. Fraizer takes us on a look at how the Indians in the mountains were living, and how they were betrayed by the United States government. It also gets lost in the gentlemen's love life as well. I did indeed like learning more about Indian culture, something which our government could have care less about, or these people would not have been forced from ther homes and sent out West. It was a new take on an old moment in the history of this country."
3,A good reading,"Mr. Frazier in this book aptly recreates an era of the indian forced mobilization westward using all his arsenal of descriptions of people and places. I felt more intrigue and confuse about his love affair with Claire. A trully good book but I felt that at times it went a bit too long. Although a good narrative, this book came just short of being a real gem. Still, I recommend this one."
3,A journey through one man's life.,"This is a slow, warm, story about all the trials and tribulations one man has seen in his life. It's flows like a shallow stream on a warm sunny day. A relaxing, easy going pace that invites you to see the world as it once was according to one man. An enjoyable read for anyone wanting to get away from the modern real world for a while."
1,A waste of a good idea,"The idea for this book had so much potential. It took me 4 tries to get through the first 30 pages of Cold Mountain, but then I loved it. Somehow this book was like those first thirty pages for the entire story, but unfortunately was just good enough to not give up. I wish I had because nothing happens. The writing is pretentious, not lyrical. the characters are one dimensional. the book is awful"
1,Dissapointing effort,"This book was not in the same league of Frazier's first effort. I found myself not caring about the characters and basically wanting the book to end. The lack of a plot would be fine if you could get caught up in the character or lost in the beauty of the language but the writing is so overblown and tedious the fact that nothing much is happening stands out. I really wanted to like this book and I was trying hard to like it as I read it but the fact of the matter is, this is a bad book."
2,"interesting at first, then a total downer","Starts off with a very real depiction of life at the place and time of the novel. That's the interesting part. It slowly devolves into an (spoiler) unappealing read. I found myself asking, why keep reading this, I have better things to do and read. And at the end, an old man with his memories doing futile actions against the modern world. What's the point?"
3,Wordy historical fiction,"These are the ramblings of an old man who is looking back on his life. Will Cooper is an orphan who is sent off by his aunt and uncle to live the life of a ""bound boy"", one who owes his livelihood to those who employ him at an outpost store. He is eventually adopted into the Cherokee tribe and becomes involved in the difficulties they face in being relocated during the ""Trail of Tears"" trek to the West. Frazier is not my favorite author, and in this book he is as wordy as he was in ""Cold Mountain"". There are bits and pieces of Cooper's story which are interesting, but for the most part Frazier's story meanders like the rivers which run through the mountains of the Carolinas where his story is set."
3,"So Much To Like, But...","I really enjoyed Cold Mountain. It was riveting and had real tension. It was Point A to Point B -- will he make it home? Will he make it home in time? What else can he possibly encounter on the way? Cold Mountain felt linear, direct. This book loops and looks and searches for a home base and doesn't know whether to leave or come back. The Trial of Tears story is buried. I grew weary of the endless descriptions of food and clothing. They were plenty evocative and many were very well done but at times it felt like all drapes and no stage. Some marvelous imagery, some very hard to even comprehend."
2,Long and boring,"Loved Cold Mountain. But this book - very long and slow and boring. This book could have been a barn burner, but it just plodded along and never really had any moments of excitement at all."
3,13 Moons,"The descriptive phrases seem to never end. I kept wanting the book to move somewhere but it just kept stumbling over these over-written sentences. The writing seems too forced, too calculated and lacking cadence. The author many times seems more concerned to make the language as flowery and obtuse as possible to the detriment of the story progression. Unfinished when the due date arrived I gladly returned it to the library."
2,ConstantCritic,"I have read all the reviews of this book in order to see if I have somehow missed the point. There is no argument that the author has impressive skills in creating a mood, a picture or an interesting anecdote. His first work was a Civil War version of the Canterbury Tales and each encounter added to the content of the whole and to a suspenseful conclusion. This novel wanders aimlessly, giving no satisfaction either to the plight of the Cherokee or to the substance of the main character or his relationships. The meanderings are irrelevant to any insight to the main character. His relationships to the other characters are shallow and lead nowhere. I had the feeling that Frazier tired of his story just as the colonel tired of his life. The ending is as boring as the previous 200 pages. Perhaps Frazier should write short stories"
3,"Thirteen Moons, a book",Not much I can say about this book because I really don't remember it much. I read it some time ago and not a thing sticks in my memory.
3,thirteen,"GREAT READER KUDOS TO WILL PATTON! IF YOU LIKED COLD MOUNTAIN, YOU'LL LIKE THIRTEEN MOONS. KUDOS TO FRAZIER FOR WRITING ABOUT THE CHEROKEE NATION AND THEIR STRUGGLES. LONNIE"
1,A real snoozer,I found myself constantly nodding off as I read this novel. I was only a bit comforted to find I was not alone when I read a review from the Washington Post that suggested the book would put millions of readers to sleep.
2,13 Moons,"I was disappointed in this book. I had enjoyed reading the author's previous novel, Cold Mountain. 13 Moons had some interesting information about the American Indians, but I'm not sure if the information was fact or fiction. The book seemed somewhere between a novel and a documentary."
3,Thirteen Moons,Not nearly as good as Cold Mountain. The book started out to be intriguing but really dragged at the end.
4,Don't let this one get away....,"In this book, Frazier has created characters who are, well, credible. It isn't often that I ""miss"" fictitous characters, but having finished this book that is exactly what I feel.Through this story and it's main character, I was able to relive young love and uncertainty. I felt loss of both property and family, and experienced middle-aged complexity. Ultimately, I found what peace old age offers, complete with memories and regrets. Frazier captures the thrills, disappointments, desires, hopes, and sadness of life. I wonder if Frazier truly sees the world the way he writes his stories. If so, I envy him.Like others, I enjoyed Frazier's first story more, but only by a little. I wonder if I would feel differently had I read this one first. Regardless, I'm glad I read it in spite of the mixed reviews here."
4,Charles Frazier ..Opening the West & Killing the Indian culture,Interesting presentation of a time when America was just finding itself &this Historical approach mixing early opening up of the West is a fascinatinglook at how we obliterated the Indian culture ..and a story-line very human & stark !!!
3,Not as good as Cold Mountain,"I have been waiting for Mr. Frazier to write another novel but I am disappointed in this one. To me it is not nearly as good a read as Cold Mountain was, in fact I skimmed over about a third of the book and didn't miss much of the plot line. Could someone please tell me why Will is shooting at the train? Anger at the life that has come to his mountains?And what's with Claire? What does she gain by tormenting Will his entire life?The book is full of adventure but I feel it could have been done with a faster plot."
1,Dull and flat characters,I started this book because our book group is reading it. The character is flat and self-absorbed. You get to the point that you don't care what happens to the character because he is so dull. I don't finish it because there was nothing of interest to keep me going.......You feel nothing for the characters... so why read?
2,"A boring ""story,"" but a very good word master","I do wish Frazier would have had some sort of plot in this novel, because, as in ""Cold Mountain,"" his skill with prose and description is outstanding. Actually, I think he would do better writing prose poems instead of novels. I read the first couple hundred pages waiting for the story, and then the rest of the boring book waiting for the end. I just wish I didn't feel obligated to finish reading books I start."
3,Disappointing,"Cold Mountain was always going to be a tough act to follow, however I never expected this slow moving plodding tale. In Cold Mountain, I could empathize with the major characters. I had trouble even liking these."
3,Nothing like Cold Mountain,"I snapped this book up because I loved Cold Mountain, but this book just isn't of that caliber. One of the notes on the back cover supplies the adjectives ""heart-stopping"" and ""spellbinding"", but I didn't find that to be true in my reading experience. It has a couple of good moments, but overall I would describe it instead as ""wandering"" and ""a bit dull."""
3,underwhelming,"Thirteen Moons started off so well and had my full attention. But then it turned into a strange, frustrating love story. It was worth reading but could have been a couple hundred pages shorter. I found myself scanning paragraphs saying ""blah-blah-blah-blah"" get to the point towards the end..."
1,An Empty Story,"I am a fan of Cold Mountain, but I have to say that I am disappointed with Charles Frazier's latest novel, ""13 Moons."" I have tried to read this book four times, and I cannot get past the second chapter. I feel the book is so empty and full of useless writings."
3,Good historical fiction,"Charles Frazier knows how to use the English language. Some have called him long-winded and sentimental, but I think the author's turn of phrase and sincerity are a big part of his appeal. In this book, frontiersman Will Cooper narrates his own story over the course of several decades of fictionalized history involving westward expansion and the Cherokee. Frazier's descriptions of Cooper's life and travels are infused with a moody, introspective, rich, and melancholic tone. When Cooper tells us early on in the novel 'I was always word-smitten,' I believe that may be true of the author as well...and that's to our benefit."
3,Why must everyone compare?,"I am only about half way through this book and no I don't love it but I am so sick of reading reviews were people are whining about the fact that this book isn't Cold Mountain. No it isn't Cold Mountain thats why it says 13 Moons on the cover. I don't know why people compare authors books to their other books, sometimes they are good and sometimes they aren't. Obviously Cold Mountain is a hard book to live up to because people seem to love it so maybe you guys should give the author a break and go complain about something else."
3,Take It For What It Is,"Thirteen Moons is a fictional account, not so much a novel. Frazier harkens back to Twain's yarns and autobiographical remembrances. This book is not an epic novel. This book is a group of Will Cooper's thoughts and life recollections. They are humorous, melancholic and endearing. They are descriptive, at times overly. They are at certain junctures bragadocious, pallid and self-serving (though self-serving in an unspoken sympathetic plea). If you are geared up for ""The Return To Cold Mountain"", you will be severely dissapointed. This is not a page turner. These are not charcters that will be forever etched in your mind. However, if you have an open mind to read a well-written, well-researched, fictional autobiography, you will enjoy ""Thirteen Moons."""
2,a rambling mess,"I really thought this book would be better than Cold Mountain, which I enjoyed. As I got deeper into the book, Frazier's narrative got repetitive and unfocused. The story, while interesting at the start, kind of fell apart and got monotonous and boring. Frazier has a hard time with character development. His characters are wooden and Will keeps changing his story. Frazier could have done so much more with this book rather than dwelling on words like ""slanting sunlight"" and ""moist poplar leaves falling to the ground. It seems like he just said to hell with the story and faced an approaching deadline without doing any more research on the cherokee nation. I don't know if I'll be able to finish it."
5,Hotter Than Cold Mountain,"I had not read Cold Mountain when I picked up Thirteen Moons; however, I'm glad I read it first. (I shelved Cold Mountain unfinished, but that's another review.) With Thirteen Moons, Frazier has perfected his unique style of first person narrative, historical depth and Mark Twain-like humor. It's a well-told story of the building of a nation that links untethered government ambition to the crushing of indigenous culture. But, his telling is never one-sided: the bad - and good - guys come in all colors and ethnicities. And, autodidact historians will learn something new: His passing reference to a Melungeon family led to my looking up this little-known population of mixed-race ancestry. Frazier does not present an simple read. You have to stay with him, because his characters talk and move a lot. This fast-paced narrative rewards the reader with a fun journey."
3,Disappointing,"Cold Mountain it isn't. Thirteen Moons started out pretty well, but Mr. Frazier lost his thread. Could be that the man's life upon which he based the main character became less interesting over time. Frazier's a good writer, but this is not a good book."
4,Ghost of Faulker,"As with Cold Mountain, Charles Frazier paints a haunting picture of the South before the Civil War. I hear the story as the words pass my eyes - the power of Frazier's voice is undeniable. However, is no one bothered by the ghost of Faulkner through this story? Frazier's use of small items, like the Will Cooper's ledger/diary, brought Faulkner's voice into my head. It was as if they were both telling the story.Although online research did not shed light on a Faulkner influence in Frazier's education and edification, the writing displays either a large influence or a tremendous coincidence - or maybe Frazier is Faulkner re-incarnate?"
1,Disappointing,"I loved "" Cold Mountain"" and kept plugging away to see if the plot(?) improved or the characters became more real. Too ""artsy"" in the long discriptives. What is sad I bought 2 copies and sent them for Christmas presents before I realized the book was not worth the effort."
2,Thirteen tries,"That is about how many times it took me to get this book started. Charles Frazier obviously loves the Appalachians and their history, but he shouldn't be the one to write about them.He tried to have folksy prose, which is appealing when written by Mark Twain and others with the talent to pull it off. Often a sentence would start off wonderfully, but end up running on and destroying all of the effects. Frazier was obviously in need of some editing, but probably loved every word too much to cut it out.Instead of letting his characters speak to each other, he wrote their thoughts directly to the reader. This made it feel like a lecture and not a story. Many of his characters thoughts actually felt like Frazier speaking to you. This helped make his characters flat. If people did not find them that way, it is probably because they have a better imagination than Frazier.There will be people who like this book and his style, but I am very sure that this book will be forgotten over time."
1,Thirteen Moons,This book on my iPad Kindle was a terrible read.If I had purchased it in hardcover I would have returned it.What a waste of money and I am pissed off at myself for paying the outrageous price this e-book cost me.;(
2,"Nice game, but buggy","My nine year-old daughter liked playing this game, but the program is filled with too many bugs & glitches. We called the software support help-line and talked to a perfectly nice guy who had no idea how to help us (it turned out that he knew next to nothing about the Sabrina software). In the end, we finally gave up and left the software on a shelf, where it sits today. Very frustrating!"
3,A bit difficult for that age group,"The box says 8-12 years old but I personally feel this game may be too challenging. I'm a 20 year old college student who got this game for x-mas and I had major problems getting through the levels with all the ""bad guys"" swarming around. It took me a few days to complete and I always ended the game that day very frustrated. If you need a hint, Aunt Louisa in the Labtop can be of great help. The graphics are pretty good but the instructions are lacking. Good luck with this game!"
4,SABBY IS THE BOMB,"tHIS IS A COOL GAME U GET TO MAKE SPELLS AND FIND SALEMAND ITS REALLY HER VOICE, SALEMS VOICE AND HER SISTERS VOICE.IT IS HARD TO ZAP THEM IN TIME THOUGH."
5,Journey Of The Magi,"Roberts adventure attempting to follow the journey of the Magi to the birthplace of Jesus is one of the most significant books I've read to date. All rolled into one, this book is an honest look at the modern day Middle East, a very humorous and exciting adventure story complete with illegal border crossings and trusting some most dubious guides and an excellent recap of the history of Persia and the Christian religion. Beyond all that though, this book makes the case that modern organized religions have it all wrong. The message Jesus brought and the effort to preserve it was lost ages ago in the dogmas and doctrines of competing religious organizations, all claiming to possess the truth.Paul Whiting"
5,I witnessed this performance,"I witnessed this performance in NYC and it was mind blowing...the CD delivers the same impact. If you Dvorak cello concerto by another cellist (Starker, perhaps?) don't hesitate to pick up this CD...Yo-Yo Ma's performance is much different."
5,Nick's review on dvorak cello concerto,"Dvorak is obviously one of the most superb concerto composers in egsistance but this album brings togeather in perfect harmony the sounds that you want to hear on an evening night of obsorbing wonderful music. Not only does the orchestra have a wonderful idea of how Dovorak wanted this to be played, but the cellest is perfect in their interpretation. The sweet sound of the cello does not overpower the orchestra in this sellection, but neither does the orchestra. You will be astounded repeadidly by one of Dovorak's most wonderful concertos trully brought to life."
4,Can't beat the price,"This flag is what it is - a very cheap Virginia flag. I would rate it lower because frankly, the quality is mehhhhhh, but for the price, you absolutely can't complain. The nylon fabric is pretty thin and light shines through, but the colors are surprisingly dark and offer good contrast on the seal. The only thing I really don't like is that the seal is a mirror image on one side, not double-sided. I suppose that is OK, but some buyers might not prefer that.Bottom line is, I could buy 10 of these for the price of one *slightly* better made flag. If you're looking to fly your colors on a daily basis, you may want something else, but for occasional, or even daily use this is perfect, no complains about overall sustainability yet. I'd buy another one from this vendor, shipping was quick too."
4,excellent service,we received our item in the mail immediately it was well package and offered coupons for further purchases. very good experience
1,boring and immature,"I can't believe anyone would like this book. I agree with others who said the dialogue drags, adds nothing to the plot, and seems as if it was a high school student's first attempt to write. This is not worth the time. The characters and plot are underdeveloped and there is nothing to keep you hanging on."
5,Charming Lily by Fern Michaels,I think it was a great book won't talk about it so you will read itBut it was charming
4,Charming Lily gets charmed,"This a fun read with all the ingredients (situations, emotions, integrity, money, romance, suspense, change and resolution) Fern Michaels brings to her heroines, their family or friends along with the unconditional love of their dogs. This time around reader gets a new slant through a bit of ""magic"" or ""supernatural"" of the spiritual world. The clever usage of an object of charm brings about the fullest meaning of the word ""charming"" to streghten the book's title. Added to the fun of this book is is the inclusion of characters from other Michaels books and series."
1,I can't beleive this book was rated so highly by others!,I was astonished to see how highly this book was rated. It's the worst book I've read in a long time. The story line had thepotential to be interesting but the author failed to bring it tolife. The characters were one dimentional and the dialog between them was just silly. It read like a high school student's first attempt at a novel.
2,Flat and forgettable,"Dante's Inferno, despite a fairly intricate plot, fails to deliver much suspense or mystery. Most of the developments upon which the story twists and turn were formulaic and predictable. Sylvia's character is one-dimensional, and the adventures in which she participates would never be remotely possible in a real life setting. The other characters simply hover around Sylvia, who calls the shots for police, forensics, FBI,other psychiatrists, and the rest of a large but poorly defined cast of supporters. Even sociopath John Dantes comes across as wooden, as he helplesslessly becomes enamoured of Sylvia while trying to manipulate her. This is a long book not worth the effort it requires to reach the ""climax""."
4,Psychologically Demanding...In a Good Way!,"Los Angeles is known as many things. A city under siege is not one of them. But a madman, an intelligent yet devious madman, holds the city hostage.John Dantes has already been convicted as a murderous bomber. The threat remains even with Dantes behind bars. Someone else is out there - working with or against him.Dr. Sylvia Strange is called in as the last hope of penetrating Dantes' outer shell. And while Dantes plays cruel mind games, more bombs rock the city.Sylvia is quickly thrust into the center of a carefully calculated plan. Trying to get into Dantes' head could cost innocent people their lives, as well as her own.There's only one way to stop the source. Get into the mind of a killer. And get out before the timer hits zero.Sarah Lovett has really done her homework. It's easy to see an incredible amount of research went into creating this novel. Lovett's talent for writing vivid action scenes put that research to good use."
2,Not what I expected,I had seen a much larger version of this a year or so ago. I didn't realize how small this was. It's the size of a pen you can put in your pocket. I paid $12 for groung shipping which was a total rip-off given this could have been sent in a regular envelope. I didn't read the fine print and thought this was a walking stick size pole. Go to your local hardware store to buy this. Don't bother with it on line.
4,Early Vangelis is suprisingly unique,"L'apocalypse is a strikingly intriguing mix of jazz, flowing ballads, and deep ambient themes. His sounds, although somewhat relying on the quirky 70's new age instruments, can be surprisingly effective in conveying moody soundscapes. I particularily like the two last songs because they conjure up a fantastic imagery in their sounds, and I believe that they may be some of Vangelis's best!"
3,A satisfying piece of work,"This Vangelis album--L'Apocalypse des Animaux--was released in 1973. It is a film soundtrack. Seven compositions are contained. All of them are gratifying. The album starts off with the rollicking ""Apocalypse des Animaux--Generique."" ""La Petite Fille de la Mer"" is a sweet-sounding, relaxing, and nicely crafted piece. I also enjoy ""Le Singe Bleu,"" which displays a lonely quality about it. The disc is just over 35 minutes. This is a recommendable piece of work."
1,Missing the End of the Book,"This is a wonderful book. It's fast paced and suspenseful, I had trouble putting it down. Unfortunately, this version contains only the first 20 of 31 chapters and leaves the hero with the following paragraph: ""Mental torment gave way to acute physical pain and that again to the merciful blankness of negation."" Very frustrating. I was able to find the end on a free internet site. I wouldn't recommend this particular version."
2,Interesting but a bit disappointing.,"I found that the author seems to have taken other peoples ideas and wrote them down without doing his own research. Some of the things he tells you are a bit misleading, but probably not on purpose. The author seems to be mixing a bit of New Age and Christianity together. The book does have some interesting theories that I have not read anywhere else before. To bad it was all out of one chapter! Before you decide to put his theories into practice learn what prayer is really about first. To do that read the book 'Mighty Prevailing Prayer'. Then decide what is the best way to approach each situation that requires prayer."
2,Braden's Going to Tell You What He Knows (Not Much).,"I just finished this book. As I started out, I was really excited by the ideas mentioned in each chapter. At the end, I was disappointed that he spent all of those pages and words to say, actually, nothing. It was: ""I'm going to tell you something really neat... soon ... pretty soon ... soon... 'bye. I felt so disappointed and kind of dumb because I really thought he had something to say. I hate to say it, but you'll have to keep looking for a good book on the subject. This one was like a high school report by a kid who really doesn't know the subject."
2,"Bends easily, Nice handle","The stainless steel fork is pretty thin and bends easily. Mine arrived bent into a complete curl. The box was crushed in shipment. It was easy to straighten out but one area was bent into a right angle and wouldn't straighten out completely. The metal is just too thin and soft but the points on the fork are very sharp. I really like the wood handle. It is nice and long with a comfortable grip. However, it comes with hand wash and towel dry instructions. ""Do not soak or immerse tool in water.""So the handle is nice but the fork itself is pretty weak and bends easily."
5,Emotionally Powerful!,"I could hardly put this book down, from the opening prologue right to the end. There's a lot to like about this book--a heroine who's had a rough life, but isn't a victim. A hero I just fell in love with--and a great cast of supporting characters. This book tackles a difficult subject matter with wisdom and honesty. I'll be looking forward to her next book."
3,There's Some Good Stuff On Here,"I think that this was the first album I bought from Yngwie. I used to play it all the time. There's some inpressive guitar playing on this, especially ""Crying."" I also think that this was the first album where the vocal songs were more of a standout. I don't care much for the vocal songs on the previous two albums. ""You Don't Remember, I'll Never Forget,"" is really good, and one of my favorite guitar solos of all time is on ""Fire."" That solo blows me away. Good album, and one of Yngwie's best offerings. Mark Boals was his best vocalist up to this point."
2,"2 songs good, rest are dated.","YAWN, SNORE! Those are the thoughts I had when listening to the regular songs. There all that ""evil in the night-never in the day because day is less frightening"" feel. The only thing that was good about them was the solos...THAT NO ONE CAN EVER PLAY! God, Yngwie, SLOW DOWN! MORE! MORE! SLOWER! SLOWER!, etc...On the other hand, I loved the instrumentals. Crying was very nice, and it reminded me of Paco De Lucia. The Trilogy Suite really shows his skill, and his flamenco style. But, he does rip off Bach in one of the passages.This album should've been his last. Oh Well."
4,TRILOGY shreds !!!!!!!!!!!,"TRILOGY not only shreds ,...but has great songs !!! .....looking for a new group to discover???......check out MAGNITUDE 9 from usa ,....a great new melodic/neoclassical metal type of group.....AMAZON sells the MAGNITUDE 9 cd ,.... check them out ,...its a good debut cd....from a new band."
1,Where are the songs?,"Great guitar technique, yes, plays fast, yes, and original for the time, yes. As for the songs. 'You don't remember, I'll never forget'. Come on! What a load of rubbish. This is just a widderly didderly guitar album with no songs written with any thought or meaning. Be honest could you play this album to anybody?"
3,For guitarists ONLY!,"Yes, it's dated. Yes, It's short. I know that. But, it's the greatest exercise for guitarists. Yngwie maybe can't write mainstream stuff, be he is perhaps the greatest guitar soloist. I really liked Crying because of it's flamenco style. Other than the other instrumental, this is just cheesy 80's rock with excellent solos. Pretty good."
1,"disorganized, incomplete, outdated...",Sorry to say that this book was a waste of money and more importantly a waste of my time...1) No step by step for how to set up a nameserver in the internet proper.2) Vague references and pointers to material in chapters.3) There are confusing little bits of stuff that he doesn't mention. Like networksolution's and their role et al...
2,This book sucks,"I don't know maybe the way the book is organized... the small fonts make the book very unclear to follow. It is hard to follow. I had to buy another review book. Now i have Peterson AP Chem book and that book is GREaT!! but this one sucks!SERIOUSLLY BUY THE PETERSON""S AP CHEM>>> That one is the best"
2,Could be much better..,"Depending on what you were looking for, this book may or may not have been helpful. If you are looking for basic concepts to pass the AP Chem exam, then this may be the book for you. Most of the stuff they cover is basic. However, if you are looking to make a 5 on the AP Chem exam, consider buying another book. Most of the topics are not covered in depth enough to get those last few points needed for a 5. Also, the questions in the book are definitely lacking. Not only are there no free response questions (which count for 55% of the AP exam, FYI) but the multiple choice questions are lacking in quality. They really don't resemble the ones on the AP exam. (Trust me, I would know - I got a 5 on the exam last year.) If you are looking for a wordy book to help you get some of the basic concepts down, go for Barrons. However, if you are trying to reach for a 5 or get some really good multiple choice problems, you might want to try the Princeton Review instead. :)"
3,More Difficult to Understand than a Regular Textbook,"This AP Guide was way too complex. I think that if you really wanted to get a 5 on the AP exam, listen to your teacher in class and take notes. This is definitely not for those people who think that they can study for the AP in one week."
3,50/50,"I don't recommend this book, unless you can't get the book by the Princeton Review (""Cracking the AP Chemistry Advanced Placement Examination""). There were many errors in the book, and the material is not covered as well as the previous mentioned. I would only use this book as a last resort, or as a supplement to the Princeton Review's or even Kaplan's books."
4,Good book to review with,"The review chapters in this book were really helpful - they were simple and concise, but had all the important information in them. I also found the explanations for why the right answers are right to be very helpful as well."
1,Deceiving ad,"The photo and title of the ad is of 2open water video tapes. The very small print is 1 dive master tape. Totally different level of certification. The seller would have taken it back but I had already tossed the package. Verrrry overpriced but again, I decided to buy it and not read the fine print. Seller admitted he knew nothing about diving as he sells a lot of books. Read the description carefully before purchasing from these large book sellers."
5,Exactly the information I was looking for!,"Well presented, informative and well documented; after reading this book I feel now I can make a conscientious decision based on facts, I have struggled with this subject for a long time, but only found vehemently expressed one-sided explanations which left me questioning even more. If you have feelings as to whether biblical dietary laws should or should not be followed you owe it to yourself to read this book!"
3,Average quality for the money.,Ok product for the money paid. Don't know how long it wil last but so far..so good.Fits great on Titan..
5,An eye opener to the atrocities commited by America against the African continent,"Irrespective of your color or race, watching this documentary will serve as an eye opener on how America has steadily committed genocide and looting of the people of Africa and their resources for several decades.America installed several African presidents so as to dictate the economy of several nations while also igniting wars and riots in order to De-populate those same nations.Real live interviews, footage as well as confidential recordings provides a solid evidence of the evil that goes on in the American government."
1,"One star for a ""Copy-cat"" Australian","Just one question: Does Holly Valance have the (copy) right/permission, to use the same sound/music as performed by ""Tarkan"" (In the ""Turkish hits 2000"" CD), the song called ""Simarik"" as sung in ""Kiss kiss""? If not; maybe Tarkan has a right (to know and) to sue her for ""Copyright"", especially if Tarkan has no idea that the Australian is taking all the kudos world-wide for some-one else's hard work! What a shame if this is true!"
1,BBC did this ???,"The BBC is usually known for good workThis is AWFULIt is unclear auditory wiseIt is uncreative animation (borders on ugly) and is bORINGThe Spanish learned is not helpful in everyday lifeMuzzy himself, the doll and the cartoon character are quite un appealingI love Spanish, speak it, understand itand I am sorry someone did not warn me as to how awful it isBBC usually stands for qualityNOT IN THIS CASE !!!oh and the instant immersion??? nOT QUITE you would be immersed in every daycoversations and going about business, work or play...this is off into silly inane directions"
3,Not as good as the movie,"This book was a spin-off from the movie, Stealing Beauty, and like most books based on movies, the book fails to capture the mood and romance of the original. Description of the Italian countryside in this books pales in comparision to Bertoluccis' masterful use of the camera. The magnetic appeal of the film is lost in second-rate descriptive attempts and clumsy use of words. Regretfully, the author gets caught up in retelling the movie's blocking and action scene by scene and forgets to focus on the characters and the story being told.However, if you enjoyed following Lucy's coming of age story and want to relive the moments, you could like this book.For people who loved the film, Stealing Beauty may be worth a look. For everyone else, I'm sure you could easily find a more thoughtful, worthwhile and enjoyable book to read."
1,"JESUS WHAT A DISASTER; SO BADLY WRITTEN, IT HURTS","This thing is abyssmal, just terrible and amatuerishly written. Nuff said."
4,"If You Dont already Have It, Get It A.S.A.P.!!!!!!",the allman brothers band rules!!! this album is amazing. with great songs like CANT TAKE IT WITH YOU and PEGASUS this is one of my personal favorites. you definately need to hear this one to appreciate it!!
3,Sub-Par,"No doubt Shei Atkins can sing and the beats keep you interested, but the reviews of this cd mislead you. While this is a christian artist this cd clearly lacks the spiritual aspect that you look for in a christian cd. Some of the songs leave you wondering what was spiritual about that? Like the song ""Betcha She"" talks about her man cheating on her and she is chanting ""Betcha she can't love you like I can"" or something like that. The beat is nice but it sounds like all the other R&B fornication cuts. And other songs leave you with a look on your face like you just ate a lemon and you think ""this girl has issues"". This gets 3 stars only because of the beats and her voice but if you are looking for something to build you up spiritualy LOOK ELSEWHERE!"
4,Life in Stereo,"I like contemporary gospel music. So I decided to check out artists that are really not well known to hear something new. Well based on the reviews for this artist they were pretty good so I decided to give her a try. I must say that I was not dissappointed. This CD is definately R&B; gospel with a message to live for God. She really ministers through her music. Whether you're going through hard times, relationship problems, family problems, she relates this through her music. I really enjoyed all the songs. The ones I liked the best were:No Love-4/5Temptation-5/5Never Letting Go-4/5No More-5/5Keep On Holdin On-4/5There was only one song I didn't like at all, ""Quit Bumpin"". I'm glad it was at the end of the CD because it was horrible. It kind of reminded me of Missy Elliott. But overall this is good music and very enjoyable. So if you love gospel with that R&B; flavor, I recommend this."
1,have not received,"This item - Platinum Glenn Miller - has never made it to me. The money was taken from my account when I ordered it. I need it resent or my money back, please. Thank you! Sherry Shepard"
4,New Orleans blues with a funky feel,"This disc is the anticipated second round of tunes artistically doled out by Osborne and Andersson. A better listen than the 1994 release, Break the Chain, but not quite as good as the real thing. This is a live band that improvises well with the help of a few friends, like the immaculate trombonist Mark Mullins, who occasionally drops in for a set. Osborne and Andersson have been known to sing a cappella with all the spirit of a Baptist choir of two. The disc is memorable, with the upbeat ""Favorite Son"" getting some local airplay. ""Pleasin' You"" has the feel of a song you might hear coming out of Tipitina's on a weeknight. ""Limestone Bay"" has a Van Morrison feel while still remaining in Anders' more distinct New Orleans' style. ""Brother, Brother"" lays on a groovy funk that isn't too hard. All in all, a good representation of what it means to live in New Orleans - the diversity of both the music and the people."
5,ONE OF THE BEST,"Anders Osborne is a triple threat: awesome blues guitarist, terrific songwriter AND one of the best singers I've heard in years. Well worth investigating..."
5,A nice find,"Somehow I'd never heard of him before and picked this from the bin on a whim. A really fine disc. Very original yet with a tip of the hat in many directions (Lowell George probably at the top of that list in terms of feel) without being derivative. Fine playing, writing, singing. The bluesy, New Orleans, swamp rocky feel lingers."
4,Great Songwriter,"This disk and his ""Living Room"" are a great new addition to any collection of ""cosmic blues"". A great songwriter with a lot to say. A great mix of styles. Haven't been able to turn him off."
4,THE LEGACY OF LOWELL.,"I was pushed in MR OSBORNES direction by a friend and what a nice direction to be shoved it is too!Anders,originally from SWEDEN like the excellent CARLA OLSON(NO RELATION)cuts that LITTLE FEAT-ALLMAN BROTHERS-FREE-ROBERT PALMER(before he brought a suit!!) type groove.He is an accomplished singer/songwriter/guitarist and this selection makes for some very,fine listening indeed.ALL the tracks are appealling but special note for LIMESTONE BAY that features some great fiddle playing and the hypnotic NOTHIN' ON that has a riff to die forHe does owe a great debt to LOWELL GEORGE but what could be a better recommendation than that? Exactly.thanx col.."
1,a 1 star rating isn't a fair appraisal,"I bought mine with extreme reluctance but I thought well I have had some luck with other Emerson products, so just maybe....... It worked great for approx 4 months. I then noticed one day the clock was not accurate. I couldn't reset the clock. Trust me I tried multiple times. Now I'm 38 yrs old, having owned too many gadgets/electronics, I never heard of the clock going bad first. That was a sign of things to come. So I marched forward setting all my timer recordings based on ""Emerson Time"". That worked well for about 2 months. At that point, the clock just quit showing up as a display. So then I decided to just use it as a video cassette player. Well after 3 weeks of work, now I just don't get power going to it. I plan to recover the tape that's in there, take it out back and shoot it and vow to listen to my inner voice the next time I decide to by ANYTHING Emerson."
2,What a shame,"I have had this (from Walmart) about 3 years now I guess. I have used it exclusively for the HDD so I can record from TV and watch later. I have to say for me it was worth the $300 just for that. I love the HDD. That being said, the rest of it is useless. The DVD player used to work to play DVDs but now it does not open properly. Also, at any given time the unit will get ""stuck"" on ""Load"" and no buttons will work at all. Then I have to unplug the whole thing and plug back in again. The VCR has never been usable, as the sound has never worked on it. So, the HDD has been priceless to me, but the rest of it might as well not even be there. I am getting cable digital soon, so won't need the HDD recorder anymore. Guess I'll end up chucking the whole thing then."
3,"Some are ok, some are not","I bought two of these batteries for 2 different models of iPaq. One works just fine, the other stopped charging after a few days.What can I say, it's a generic product. HP originals run much more expensive. So, if you are in a tight budget, this might work for you."
2,Not so great....,"I bought this as a replacement battery in October 2009. Well, it's already losing power (Jan 2010) & will need to be replaced so I guess I got the ""MISS"" version of the ""Hit or Miss""!"
4,"3.70V,1440mAh, Li-ion quality replacement Pocket PC battery","The first one that I ordered has a problem. It was labeled new and yet it did not work. It wont charged. So, when I addressed the problem thru email, there response was great. They mail the replacement right away. I'm using it for 8 weeks now and so far there is no problem. Good job Amazon/Brilliant Store."
4,timely refund,"Product was not what I needed and I was given a timely refund, great transaction, would recommend"
1,very loud!,I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY DOG READING THAT IT WAS SUPPOSE TO BE QUIET. IT IS SO LOUD I CAN'T EVEN GET MY DOG CLOSE ENOUGH TO ME TO TRIM HIM. VERY BAD PRODUCT.
3,Don't get many in the bag...,"very cool, but it's expensive. If I was getting it for my own kids I'd go with an off brand to get more for the price. Saw some great options on Etsy.comBut these were a gift so they were worth it.Barely got any in the bag"
4,"Fun, new interpretations of rock classics","I heard this playing in a toy store and made the salespeople take out the CD to find out the name! The girl-group versions of classic Beatles tunes are fresh and fun. Full disclosure: I haven't listened to the whole CD yet, but I was very impressed with the songs I heard."
2,lame,"I saw Him Standing There is not the same name as the one on Please Please Me, but still the same words"
3,Doesn't quite finish the thought,"While I found it interesting and could readily identify my problem child in this book, I found that it never fully gave you much insight in how to handle the children. Many times throughout the book the author references his methods, but does not fully describe what those methods are. When I first began to read it I was excited that I had finally found someone who had identified the problems we were going through. when I finished the book I felt like I had just read someone's opinion that there are budding criminals in the world who are quite young, but not what to do about it."
4,The covered bridge book for everyone,"From a novice to a person loving covered bridges,this book has something for everyone. And the book is beautifully done in color. Quite a bargin for the price."
3,Description misleading,"Picture shows a box, which contains four cartridges. Description 1 pk. I assummed the box was a pack. received one cartridge."
4,Good product - watch description,No issues with the product.The picture is misleading. The picture is of a box... which the boxes contain a 4 pack of the filters. The description is only a 1-pack. Misleading. I paid way to much for a single filter cartridge.
3,the 6 size fits like 5.5 size,"good shoes but size 6 fits smaller than the normal size 6, more like a size 5.5"
2,Interesting,"I bought this because it was cheaper than the longer version that I found after watching Sex and the City movie. I am glad I bought the small version because although it is good for one liners, it is kind of boring after a while to read about someone else's private life without inside knowledge. My favorite is the letter to Josephine from Napoleon, which made it worth buying the book alone."
3,OK Product,Put this filter in 2004 GMC Envoy. Can't see any difference in fuel economy or power as advertised. Won't have to replace again though.
1,Use Paper,This does nothing the paper filter doesn't do. Its not like you are going to beat Don Garlitts after putting a tacticool filter on your truck.
5,"Great style, great fit","I liked the style just from the picture.Once the jacket arrived and I got to truely see it, I was greatly pleased. I like the denim toughness and the leather type coller.This jacket is perfect for chilly days.As I said in the title, great style, great fit."
2,"AOR rock-Tina's vocals sound fresh, but not a classic","This is an interesting song if you are a die hard Tina fan (as the author of this review is), but overall not a terribly memorable track. The most interesting aspect is how much Eros sounds like Tina in her throaty lower ranges. Sometimes a listener is not sure which vocalist is singing! If you like the idea of Tina singing a Europop rock ditty, go for it, otherwise, if you like Tina rock, check out ""Love Thing"" on the ""Simply The Best"" package to hear Tina bring the house down, 80's rock style."
5,Paranormal romantic suspense with a refreshing twist.,"Beth Wagner and Cal Rollins have isolated themselves for different reasons, but the hunt for a serial murderer brings them together in more ways than one! 'Rebecca York' (aka Ruth Glick) crafts a wonderful suspense tale with a creepy paranormal edge. Beth is a psychic that 'sees' a friend being assaulted. Turns out that the now missing friend was the victim of a serial killer with links to Beth's high school graduating class. With a reunion coming up, detective Cal Rollins gets assigned to be Beth's 'husband' to sniff out clues to the killer's motive, if not the actual identity. There's a lot more, but why spoil the fun? Read it and enjoy! Highly recommeded."
2,Gibberish,"After downloading the Kindle e-book version, much of it was in computer gibberish. I don't know if it was a bad download or if it was a bad scan into the e-book format."
5,Hillarious!,"I saw this movie on the flight and it was just great - funny, funny and once more funny! It's a bit parody on ""Animal Farm"", and is full of British humor.Lasagna speech made me laugh for long long time:)Usually sequels are worse than first movie, but this not he case. Recommend this movie wholeheartedly!!!"
2,Not nearly as good as first Garfield,"My husband, my three year old, and I LOVED the first Garfield. I expected that this one might be as good because it had the same actors as in the first, but it was kind of dry and boring. We barely watched it once and never watched it again. I gave it two stars because I love Bill Murry."
3,Not the Furball's best work!,"My purchase was fine and arrived in a timely fashion. The movie itself, in my humble opinion, was not as amusing as previous Garfield romps, but then again, I am definitely out of grade school by a number of decades!"
3,Great comedy,"We ordered this for my son, but we all enjoy it. This is a truly funny movie that makes Garfield of comic fame come to life in a new adventure."
3,Garfiled - A tail of Two Kitties,"I ""dropped out"" film after a while as this film did not have the same funny slots as the first one. It did not keep me glued to the screen, waiting for the next fun to come. Although our daughter of 10 thought it was fun, she also missed some really funny stuff. Anyway, might be difficult to copy a former success, so we will still look forward to the next !"
2,A long awaited disappointment,"My family waited and waited for the release of the latest Garfield movie. We thoroughly enjoy the first, watching over and over. We popped this one in and fifteen minutes later were off doing other things. It just didn't capture our attention, even the children weren't impressed. The first one is top notch...funny, original, etc. This one was just too much of a stretch...even for a movie about a talking kitty."
1,No Stars (But That's Not A Choice) Kids Actively Turned The Movie Off,"Something happend with Garfield - A Tale of Two Kitties that has almost NEVER happened with a movie in our house. My kids (aged 7 and 5) asked me to turn off the movie becuase they hated it so much. My daughter called it 'Stupid' and my Son said 'it sucked'. They both LOVED the first Garfiled, and they often will sit through films that are less than amazing (like The Pacifier and Shark Boy and Lava Girl), but they hated this movie so much they asked to have it turned off."
4,CUTE movie,"Great movie about a fat, lazy cat called garfield. Everyone knows who he is and he is back in this funny movie about just as it is named ""a tale of two kitties"". Great movie to watch with the kids."
3,Okay Movie,Not as good as the first Garfield movie. Way to complicated for a three year old. Little disappointed.
3,Garfield - A Tail of Two Kitties,"Cute movie, good sequel. Love all the farm animals. Garfield is one of my favorite comics, and the movie does a pretty good job of catching the kind of humor that's in the comic strips."
5,a keeper for years to come!,"I had this diary when i was little, i loved it! i wrote in it all the time. I love it even more now that i'm an adult, this is great to look back on and reread what i wrote when i was little. the questions are great, questions you wouldnt just write about in a blank paged diary, it cracks me up to read my answers."
4,live concert,"This live recording of various appearances in Europa during 1961 has been ""cleaned up"" so that the ""pop"" and ""hiss"" that my 1960's purchased records have has been removed from what is heard."
5,Simply Put,"Hands down, bar none -- best book ever on writing and the writing process. It's a box chock-full of spark-plugs."
5,enlightenment of technology-,This is just an awesome book! I have not completed all of it yet for I keep finding the early chapters compelling enough to require some re-reading. Slows up the forward movement but all for the good! This is a book that all of the new practitioners [artists and writers] of the ''steampunk'' motif should also read as it fleshes out beautifully some overlooked concepts and cultural occurrences. The works used to illustrate the text are also excellent.
4,They're Baaaack!,"It's been 11 years since we saw a Nuclear Valdez release. Much too long. Although nothing is worth that kind of wait, this is a really good cd on the very first listen. ""Remember"", Stem of Tragedy"", ""Still Won't Let You Go"" and ""In a Minute All Could Change"" are great songs. These guys know all about catchy hooks. The cd also includes Spanish versions of four songs that give you even more of a good thing. Mediocre production keeps it from getting 5 stars. Just doesn't as crisp or sharp as it should. Some Spanish instrumentation would've really punched some songs up. All things considered ... a very good cd from an underappreciated band. Enjoy this cd and go buy first two."
4,no color,"The designs in this book are wonderful and the pages are fully covered with designs, with much variety. However, they are all in black and white, so the cover is very misleading."
4,More reference material for a costumer,Helpful in filling out the reference shelf for a costuming professional. Not really my area of expertise but the lady seems to like it.
4,a nice surprise,"I found out about the Knives by the CKY concert I'm going to see, I heard they were opening so I checked them out. I picked up Skin Flicks on sale at the music store so I bought it. I was very surprised, the music is well produced and is a mix between Queens of the Stone Age, Turbonegro, and the Hellacopters, the vocals are also a mix of Josh Hommes and Scott Weiland, check them out, definately a solid 4 stars."
3,Ireland driving,"Need a map to work with in conjunction with Garmin. MANY new roads not on the sw package. Showed us driving through fields! On older more established roads - workedlike a charm. It was a plus navigating in Ireland, and I would still recommend."
2,Brazil map,"The detailed map is not so good because does not include certain points such as tolls, bumps and radar indication."
4,This GPS and map are good but occasionally gets you lost,I have this my Garmin Nuvi 205W. It does pretty well at getting me where I want even if miss a turn and it has to recalculate. The problem is that sometimes it will take me down dead end streets (places that there was never a path ever!). I have been taken to the wrong place a couple times and sometimes it even waits a little to long to say turn. Overall though it does quite well and about 92% of the time it is right on and about. Another 6 or 7% it waits on turns a little too long. That extra 1 or 2% it does get you in a weird predicament (I have only had it for about a month and it has done this 2 or 3 times). Probably more on the 3.5 star side because of the price and that fact that it gets you lost sometimes where you have to turn around and that was its original path.
4,"Has everything it said, works as it should",THe only downside for this is the cost. As I have no idea what it costs to make (the physical pieces are very cheap) I only took it down to a 4.
5,Highly recommend,"I purchased for a recent trip to Ireland. It was excellent. Sometimes would take you on some very scenic routes, but always made it to our final destination. Driving on the opposite side of the road in Ireland, this allowed me to concentrate on the road rather than messing with maps."
1,Useless in western Ireland,"We found this to be completely useless on our trip to Ireland in June. We rented a car in Killarney and drove the Ring of Kerry, the Ring of Dingle, and up through The Burren to Galway. Thank goodness we had a map from the rental car company and a guide book with halfway decent maps. The Garmin could not recognize most of the addresses for our hotels and couldn't even find a lot of the towns. I'd say over 80% of the time it didn't even show us as being on a road and I took one picture where it thought we were driving in the ocean.I don't know whether it would be useful in Dublin. Like I would imagine most people do, we used public transportation there. It was a complete waste of money. I am considering writing the company to complain and requesting a refund."
5,Great add-on to GPS,"Bought this SD software for a recent trip to central Tuscany, Italy. Operated right from the start at home and was able to pre-plan various treks even before leaving the U.S. I have a nuvi 350, and the combination of CN Europe and the nuvi enabled perfect driving to and from my various visit points. It does show all the roads, big and small, and even when I thought it was wrong, it was right!! With a little research and the Garmin system, I was able to navigate from Rome to Tuscany to a small town, my accomodations and various sights. I heartily recommend the Garmin system of GPS and software to all travelers!!!"
3,Beware to get the right size SD card,"Read the compatibility chart at the Garmin website very carefully before you order an SD card. My LegendHCX requires a MICRO SD card and this item does not have a micro SD card removeable inside the standard SD card despite the instructions that come with this item. If you don't buy your item directly from Garmin, Garmin will not exchage it for the proper media."
4,Where the Heck am I,"I'm currently in Schwienfurt, Germany and I wanted to put the card and the Garmin NUVI 350 to the test. I would drive to various towns in an ""attempt"" to get lost ( thats ""guy speak"" for I'm really lost, but won't admit it) and find my way back to the town and the place that I was staying. So, I would hook up the system and after a few errors(I made wrong turns just so I could get it to recalculate....right!) it got me out of the town and home. I would just add destinations, but had no real address and it got me there. I tried the other features and they worked to some degree. Reasturants were lacking. I think its best to ask people where to eat and rely on additional resources to identify attractions/sights to see, but over all this is a great addition. I didnn't have to do anything but slide the card in and I was ready to go. Worth what I paid.One suggestion is to practice going short distances initially to get the feel of how it gives direction."
4,Easy to get around Ireland,This worked great all over Ireland including all the small back roads.And all I had to do was push it in and it started working. No real installation required.
3,Poor,Poor in details outside cities and big towns.Insuficient in max speed information.Needs more improvement and inclusion of suburban information.
2,Don't Rely on the Garmin in Ireland!,"After being beholden to the Garmin for getting us through Spain last summer, I didn't hesitate to buy the Garmin map for Ireland. Fortunately I had read other reviews of the chip and was prepared to find some roads unaccounted for by the Garmin. We were fine getting around Dublin and the route toward Cork, Kinsale and on to Kenmare. Heading north along the west coast, however, we were terribly disappointed by the Garmin. Beyond Trabert into County Clare and the large city of Galway, the Garmin was totally worthless. If we hadn't had the Collins road map, we would have been entirely lost. It's not like the roads are new in western Ireland!!! Come on, Garmin........get with the program and get your act together!!! I spent a good sum of money on the product and it wasn't as advertised."
2,Garvin City Navigator SD Card for Europe,"Having used the city navigator briefly while in Sicily, I've found the maps totally outdated. I eventually found my destination, but only after some frustration. It usually had me taking the longest route. It clearly needs updating! Fortunately, you cannot get lost using it."
4,Great product.,"I purchased the Garmin City Navigator Europe for a trip to Ireland. It was definitely a good investment. Driving without it would have been a nerve wracking experience. It quickly recalculated a missed turn, and had all the little lanes and roads on the map. My only complaint is that when I loaded it after purchase (9/2009), it said that it was not the most current version, and that I should update on the Garmin website. I didn't bother to do that, and on the trip I found myself on some new roads that weren't on the map. It didn't cause me any trouble, but I would recommend updating for anyone who buys this product."
4,"Review of SD Car, City Navigator Nt UK & Ireland","We used this card in our Garmin during a recent 10 day trip to Ireland. We drove over 1400 miles and it kept us from getting lost numerous times. Our only criticisms are that, as tourists, it would have been nice to have directions to more attractions and that it tended to take us on very narrow roads when there was sometimes a much better road going to the same destination. After a few days, we routinely checked its directions against the map. It was, however, invaluable driving through cities and towns and I would definitely use it again."
4,nuvi 260 GPS europe map very helpful,We have just returned from 2 weeks of driving in France. The European SD card with the Europe maps for our Nuvi 260 was the best travel investment we made. I was able to drive with the confidence that if lost I could count on the GPS (we nicknamed the voice Molly) to get us to our hotel or our goal that day. Also it made driving in Paris to return our car far less stressful. If you are driving in Europe I would strongly recommend one. They were offered with our rental car for an extra $20 a day so the investment in our own was worth it.Monte Montana
3,Not Very Useful if You're Walking,"I bought a Garmin Nuvi 260w as a portable device to take on a walking vacation in the UK. I bought the plug-in card with the Europe maps.The GPS unit is marketed as a portable unit with auto, pedestrian and cycling set-up options. We were using it for hiking and I assumed the maps would be pre-loaded with the major walking trails and footpaths but it isn't. If you're walking in the UK, you'd be better off with an ordnance survey map which shows the official footpaths."
3,Lacks atualization,"The brazilian map requires atualization, there are shopping centers, streets and other places that are more than 3 years old and they don't appear in the gps guide. Besides that it works perfectly."
1,HORRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRIBLE!!,"If I could give this European card no stars, I would. This was nothing but a huge disappointment! We expected our Garmin with this card to work as well as it does in the Us. We could NOT have been more wrong. It would take 10-15 minutes to find a satellite, if it even found one. Then once it found it, it would lose it very easily. The few times it actually did work (and I mean few!) it would makes us walk out of our way, up to a half mile one time. We were there for 6 weeks and I think this card worked for us, maaaaaaaaaaaaybe 3 times. Biggest waste of money we've ever spent."
1,Took too long,I ordered this three weeks before my trip and it do not come in time. I will be returning this item and will not be doing business with this company again. If you can not have quicker service than that you should inform the customer of this.
5,"Great, but unintentionally funny!","The City Navigator worked perfectly on our recent trip to Spain. It got every road right and found all the shortcuts. There are two issues: first, the navigator has a hard time distinguishing between the AutoVia main highways and the quaint, but ill-paved local roads. If it's shorter, it tells you to take the turnoff. Just ignore those tendencies and let it re-calculate a route on the good roads. Second, the pronounciation of the Spanish road names is quite funny. It took a while, but we figured out that ""call"" means Calle and the more complicated place names were undecipherable. All in all a wonderful product."
3,touring in france,"We used the Europe Navigator card for our recent trip to Nice, France. It worked well, but it was not always correct in finding the smaller streets in the small villages of Provence. We had to rely on a map to ensure we were getting proper directions from our Garmin."
4,Getting around Italy,"The software worked great and got to our destination without much difficulty. The only ""problem"" that we experienced involved the English pronunciation of Italian names, which made identifying some streets a challenge. Overall worth the cost."
2,Pretty colors but...,"I don't know if all of the paper is like this, but the paper I got is printed just a little 'off'. The end result is somewhat painful to the eyes- like wearing the wrong glasses prescription. While it is cut into perfect squares, the paper is very thin and I end up getting little wrinkles in places I don't want them. So, it's usable, but not great."
5,Clear as Day,I was using Staples paper in matte...No comparison. The clarity on the printed page was awesome. My pages look like they were traditionally scrapped. People run their fingers across to make sure. I will not use anything else for my digital pages.
3,Epson Matte Scrapbook not satisfactory white,I was expecting a 11.7in X 11.7in and received a true 12in x 12in (that is not bad).The bad is that the paper is not as white as expected and I don't know if it depends on this EPSON paper type or what else (I didn't find the paper in store to compare).Packaging/Delivery was OK.
1,LONG AND DRAGGED OUT,"Although this paperback true crime is probably about the same number of pages as most other true crime books, this one dragged out so long I thought it would never end. It was one side-bar after another, which are never interesting to anyone other than the lawyers (as we learned in the OJ trial!)This case is one of the more interesting I've read about. Very intelligent and interesting characters, including the children. But -- besides there being no photos of the people involved (other than the cover picture), there was almost no story-telling, just discovery of a crime, then the trial and side-bars, then the end, wrapped up in one page. Amazing that this writer could make such a fascinating case so boring. Maybe another writer will tackle the story? No wonder I've had this on my shelves for so long......... Something told me it was not worth reading........"
1,Died quickly,"The drive I had failed miserably, it was used for backup infrequently and failed much faster than one one expect. I would avoid these drives."
3,Beware of getting a no-warranty drive!,"I ordered this drive to replace the one that has just gone bad in my Sony UltimateTV receiver. I was expecting to receive a retail box, with the all-important warranty, but I got a brown box, an OEM product, instead. If the warranty is important to you, buy this drive from a retail store or someplace that guarantees it will not be DOA or offers their own warranty. This drive from Tech Depot ships with no paperwork or retail packaging, just the drive itself in a brown box. The drive itself is fine, but I am disappointed that it wasn't clearly stated it was an OEM product and not full retail packaging."
4,One of the most gruesome books I've ever read,"Once again Masterton has produced a chiller that would have made Edgar Allan Poe proud. RITUAL is about a restaurant reviewer and his son who run afoul of a strange religious cult led by eccentric restauranter, M. Mussette, who take the sacrament of Holy Communion a little too literally: by eating each others flesh and blood. A standout scene involves a man being forced to slice off his own finger and then fry and eat it, it's got to be one of the most disgusting things I've read. For those of you with weak stomachs, you should avoid this one like the plague. Horror fans ought to enjoy it; but this is not a book to be picked up right after dinner."
5,Feminine audacy and essence,"Linda Pastan's poetry embodies the secrets and longings of an intelligent and artistic woman living the double essence of a wife/mother and a studious and inspired poet. Her images are sharp, violently emotional in a context of harsh realities. Her reinvention of religious and classical myths grounds daily female routines, giving them wings at the same time."
2,disappointing sequel,"I read Veritas after reading Hostile Witness and found the author using the same old plot devices that seemed novel in the first - letters/statements from characters that explained complicated plot antecedents.While a lot of the dialogue is quite good, much is long declamatory prose that explicates the character or the plot. The intricacies of the relationships and the exaggerations of plot elements became unbelievable and sort of silly in what was meant to be a realistic novel. It just got sort of boring - I finished it but didn't care."
2,Great story but hideously annoying style!,"I've never read a book that made me more conscious of the author. The plot was creative and intricate, the setting was fascinating and well described, and the characters were well developed, but oh, the prose! The style felt needlessly pretentious and overwrought, and I found myself becoming so annoyed with the author's intrusion into the story that I could only read it in small doses. I found myself mentally begging the author to get out of the way. I debated whether to read the rest of the series, because I found this book to be quite fascinating, but I decided it wasn't worth the annoyance."
4,Just like Star Wars or the Terminator (The sequels were better),"We discovered the Little Quack books out of order. As such, the bar was already set high withLittle Quack's New Friend. The original, in comparison, seems a bit monotonous, just likeFive Little Monkeys Jumping on the Bed.This does have merit: not only for Derek Anderson's adorable art, but for teaching counting (1 to 5 with the ""Quack-U-Lator""). Some parents may also find it useful for kids afraid to try swimming (or any new thing, for that matter).Lauren Thompson's duck debut is for many parents an obvious purchase, sort of a modern bookend equivalent toMake Way for Ducklings. Still, we prefer Little Quack's New Friend, which offers not only a sequential story arc but a great message to boot.First Scholastic Printing edition, March 2004"
3,first time not 100% pleased,"I deperately needed this book for study and was so happy to find a great price. The description said it was in very good shape, however the binding is actually in really bad shape. This is the first time I have not been 100% satisfied with the condition of what I purchased from Amazon, sometimes I made mistakes in applications, but I may have opted for the slightly more expensive book if I had known the binding was falling apart. I do use the book and it is doing what I needed it to do...."
3,"Great pictures, other info. questionable","The pictures in this book are excellent, and can be used by anybody learning point location. As far as the description of point location, they differ from the source used for the california state board exam, which only matters if you are planning on taking it. There are also some helpful tips for locating certain points. The info. on point functions and indications is tremendous. Everything and anything is in this book. Some really obscure stuff, which is great to read and think about. But that does not mean that these points are really used for this, or that you will be able to make the point do that. All in all great for location, but use some scrutuiny when apllying functions and indications."
5,Student of Dahn Yoga Classes,"Dahn Yoga for Multiple Sclerosis and Similar ConditionsI am a student in this class being presented on this video and my daughter (Cindy Bolton) is a participant in this video. Cindy has MS and has been fighting it for 15 years. She has been wheel chair bound for the last 4 years. Since she has been participating in Cathy Downie's Dahn Yoga classes, she is now using her walker most of the time and only uses her wheel chair for long shopping trips. I have arthritis in my knees and have had a lot of trouble walking and since I have been participating in these classes, the pain has diminished. I highly recommend this video! It is very tastfully presented and ALL abilities can participate. You will see on the video how the 4 students adapt the exercises to each individual's ability. This is a WONDERFUL BREAKTHROUGH for all of us."
5,The best exercise video for people with MS!,I know many people with multiple sclerosis whose lives have been changed by practicing Dahn Yoga. A few of the practitioners who were previously confined to using wheel chairs or assisted walking devices now are able to move their bodies more freely and comfortably. I think the strength of this DVD comes from the simplicity of the exercises and the tools it gives each person to manage and improve their own health condition naturally. Dahn Yoga for MS is giving people their lives back.
2,Dahn Yoga,"Video says it is suitable for wheelchair users, but rarely shows how. A lot of time spent showing/explaining ""alternate moves"", but the wheelchair participants are only randomly shown in a small window in background. If you cannot get up and down from floor, the movements are limited."
1,this is not yoga,This is neither classical or modern yoga therapy. It is some sort of oriental medicine and has no research supporting the many ridiculous claims made in the dvd.
2,"Great product, incomplete specs.","I don't know whose job it is to post specs of these devices but this product was clearly declared as an International Version for 230VAC operation. I ordered one and had ahipped halfway around the world only to find out that it was hardwired for 50Hz operation only, and clearly incompatible with our 60Hz supply.I wrote TrippIte to clarify and they did declare that they designed it for the more popular implementation of 230VAC/50Hz rather than for both 50 and 60Hz.Fortunately, Amazon allowed the item to be returned even beyond the 30-day return period with a full refund after listening to my explanation.I give both Amazon and TrippLite for handling the situation well, I give 1 star to whoever wrote the specs for the product page."
4,ozzy does hard rock,this like ultimate sin is more hard rock than metal but ozzy makes hard rock actually cool this was his first album with jake e lee one of my favorite guitarist alltime instead of silly little tricks and lame tapping that appeals to 15 year olds like randy rhodes did jake e lee has well thought out cool solos and never does more than the song needs my 2 favorite songs on here are waiting for darkness and bark at the moon this album isnt as good as the next one ultimate sin but its still good and shouldnt be overlooked
1,Not Original?,"If it's not the original, not worth a dime. Thanks to previous reviewers for pointing this out. I tried to locate the original on Amazon, but don't see it anywhere. Would I need to get a CD to get the original, and is it worth the trouble, expense, etc? I'm new to Ozzy's work, so don't know how to rate his releases."
4,"Original recording - good, This - not good","The 4-star rating is for the original album, before ozzy became all greedy and such. It brings a tear to my eye to see this happen to some very good metal albums. Unlike ""diary"" and ""blizzard"", this album has been completely remixed, and unless you are a new ozzy fan, this album is a waste of time.FIND THE '95 ORIGINAL!!!!"
1,THE WORD HAS TO GO OUT ABOUT THIS....RE-RECORDED ALBUM...,"This is correct, Sharon and Epic have done it again with putting new drum and bass parts in the album. All of the songs have different drum patterns in certain parts of the songs they are Not remixed. ""Now you see it now you dont"",""Rock n roll rebel"" have different drum sounds or altering of the beigining of a song, not like the original re-issues back in 95' which sounded normal. ""Centre of eternity"" the bells are not the ones on the original album. The title track is also different. Ozzy's vocals also echoed alot on the original album but not this one. Also in the booklet of credits it says all songs written by Ozzy. Nope.That's not true other people helped him. Its in the original album credits. Sharon and epic Ruined a heavy metal classic. Disgraceful to ruin a legend's work..."
3,Bark at the moon could have been better,"I'm sorry, everyone out there, but this one just didn't do it for me. It could have been so much better. Bark at the Moon is the only song I enjoy, and it's not even one of his better songs. I would stick with Ozzmosis and Live and Loud for all the Ozzman's greatest."
2,Jake E Lee is no Randy Rhoads.,"From the start of the album, every single note seems to sound neo-classical. That is Randy Rhoads and Yngwie Malmsteen's style, not Jake E Lee's. His real style, if you ask me, comes out in Ultimate Sin. For some reason, he can capture my attention there but not here.( see my reciew, written in aug 21 or 22 i think)"
2,Osbourne Howls Too Little,"First of all,let me say I am an Ozzy nut but I try to be objective.Bark At The Moon is the biggest dissappointment of Ozzy's career. Jake E. Leeis no Randy Rhoads on guitar, and most of the songs are uninspired. Rock N Roll Rebel is the one stand out on the album. Often overlooked in the success of Ozzy's first two solo albums is not just Rhoads playing, but the fact Osbourne had a great songwriter to help him."
3,3 stars for 1 track,"There is only one track on this album that is awesome and thats the Title. As for the rest of this album, one word - cr*p."
3,Ozzy continues to make authentic and good rocking,"""Bark at he moon"" continues to reveal Ozzy's talent to find gifted guitarrist. This is the first studio recording withou Randy Rhoads, replaced after his death briefly by Brad Gillis, then permanently by Jake E. Lee, which is a great player. Tough, ""Bark.."" lacks really great songs, but in the average it keeps up with Ozzy's voice and potential."
3,SOME GREAT SONGS....,"BARK AT THE MOON got some great OZZY songs like CENTRE OF ETERNITY, NOW YOU SEE IT and the classic title track...but the rest of songs are not so inspired...not one of the best moments from OZZY...."
3,Ozzy - Bark At The Average,"Of the 5 Ozzy albums that I own this one is my least favorite. It is not a bad album, but not up to the standards of his best works either. ""Bark"" was the first studio album released after the death of guitar god Randy Rhoads. Jake E Lee fills in well here for the most part, but lacks some of the flair that Randy brought to the table on Ozzy's earlier albums. The title track was a big hit off the album although again not one of Ozzy's best singles in my opinion. The rest of the tracks are pretty typical 80's metal with nothing really standing out to my ears. The album contains a significant amount of cheesy sounding keyboards. I have nothing against keys in rock n roll, but here, most of the time, it makes the album sound dated and really ads very little to the overall presentation. To my ears ""Bark"" is a very average Ozzy album."
2,"Go directly to ""Diary of a Madman""","Ozzy Osbourne has given us some of the best heavy rock of all time. This record does not have it. This one was the first studio release after ""Diary of a Madman"" and it shows. Ozzy clearly suffered from the loss of Randy Rhodes. He had limited time to find a worthy replacement, so we were subjected to Jake, I couldn't write a song even if god himself wrote it for me, E. Lee.A couple of these songs are gems. Three of them actually, ""Bark at the Moon"", ""Rock and Roll Rebel"" and ""Center of Eternity"". Everything else is bad.If you are going to buy Ozzys stuff may I suggest in this order; ""Diary of a Madman"", ""Blizzard of Ozz"", ""Ozmosis"", ""Tribute"", or anything he recorded with ""Black Sabbath"". Amen."
2,Up and Down,"This album has 3 great singles but not much else going for it. The title track is an obvious great song, which shows that guitarist Jake E Lee can play very well. Rock N Roll rebel is also a decent number, so is the last track Waiting for Darkness. But like Ultimate Sin after this album it is just filled with weak songs. Come on now Centre of Eternity, Slow Down and So Tired, sound lame today. I know that all the Ozzy fans reading this will shout bloody murder but come on. The keyboards really kill the metal aspect of both is album and Ultimate sin following it."
2,"2002 rerecording, poor master",Thought it was the remaster of the original 1983 recording. It turned out to be a 2002 version with the retracked guitars. The master sounded overly dark with a plenty of bass and not enough details in the mid range. Couldn't enjoy neither the music nor the sound quality.
1,Simple Arabic? Not!,"Avoid this book because it's just a rehash of the complex grammar of the Arabic language and is totally lacking in pedagogic value. The authors incorrectly assume that by presenting the labyrinthine syntax of the Arabic language you'll somehow gain competency and fluency. It will never happen. While it may prove useful as a reference grammar to someone who has already mastered the language, it should by no means be confused with a practical introduction to Arabic."
4,An intesting story of mocking the british army+life in 1777,"An intesting book about the story of the narrow minded puritansfighting back against the british army ,once a great powerful one.A great book espescilly when the army are made out to be fools.A well written book of life in 1777."
3,"Come on D, you can do better","don't get me wrong this album is bumping but lyricly Willie is just trying to cover too much ground. Going from child advocate on one song to mack daddy on the next just doesn't jive. Also I hate ""chopped and screwed"" and there was one song on there called 'desperado' which would have been a good single on disc 1 since I've never heard this song anywhere else. ""Coldblooded"", ""Knock m'out"" and ""Come Hell or High Water"" are really the only songs I could really recommend.Not Bad, but I was hoping for some more of his 'going out lika soldier' style. I must admit though that this cd has greatly improved production values compared to his last 2 releases(Relentless) and (Loved by Few, Hated by Many) so all in all it's a-ite"
3,still going out like a soldier,"y'all know scarface is not the only member of geto boys, right?? wille d is an very important part of their success. on this album he shows u why he souldn't be overlooked. willie d doesn't waste studio time rhymin' about ice, rims, and clothes. he talks about how people buy image these days and not content. on the song ""so What"" he tells: so what u got house on the lake and tons of jewelry, u haven't helped the community.willie d has always been a str8 forward rapper and he doesn't sugarcoat jack. ""little people with little burdens"" is a deep song about how society 4get how much pressure a troubled child can have on them. go get the album, how much more money, clothes, ice and ... can u take."
5,What a band that was forgotton !!!!!!,Well to sum it all up i got this album for free out of the garbage One of the best albums i have ever heard Seriously they are as good as coldplay but alittle up beat cross between coldplay and vertical horizen well for [the money] this album is a steal sincerly jason jay442guy@aol.com if anyone know what happened to this band thanks Jason i think there time is now !!!!
5,They boys rock with intimate lyrics & composed rock lullabie,"Their entrance into their word of connection, dope and intimacy humbles & elevates my awareness. Seeing them control the Troubadour 2 summers ago was such a sweet experience, complete with an after-show party at the White House in Bel Aire/Beverly Hills. Ahh, the sharing..."
5,This is not the original album,"On the original 1969 'Best of Bee Gees' the sixth song was 'Spicks and Specks'. On this CD they've replaced that song with 'Tomorrow, Tomorrow'. The only possible reason for this is that 'Spicks and Specks' was originally a monophonic recording which had been electronically reprocessed for stereo for this 1969 album. I still recommend it, but it takes enough away from the original that I'll pass on it . . . OK, I have two of their original 1969 albums . . . and besides, the song is on their CD 'Bee Gees Their Greatest Hits The Record'. The Best of Bee Gees CD is a must for fans...for what is on it! It was the first Bee Gees album I had. That's why I have two now. I kind of wore out the first, and I've been a Bee Gees fan ever since."
5,BeeGees Fan,I am a fan of the BeeGees since their beginning. Love all their old music and their disco too. Have a lot of their music/
4,GREAT CLASSIC BEE GEES,"OK, THIS WAS A GREAT LP....NOW A GREAT CD. TO BE HONEST, THE ONLY WAY I CAN GET ALL THE *BEST OF* SONGS I LIKE IS TO GET THESE BEST OF BEE GEES VOL.1 & 2. THE ONLY THING I FEEL BAD ABOUT THESE *BEST OF* CD'S IS THAT I THINK THEY COULD HAVE DONE BETTER WITH THE PACKAGING , I MEAN AT LEAST THE FRONT INSERT COULD HAVE BEEN AT LEAST A FEW PAGES WITH SONG AND/OR BEE GEE INFO AND/OR PHOTO'S....ALL THEY HAVE IS A SINGLE SLIP OF *LITE* CARD STOCK WITH THE LP COVER ON IT ... KINDA CHEAP I THINK ... BUT THE MUSIC IS GREAT !!!OH' YES , ONE MORE THING I'M DISAPPOINTED ABOUT. THE ORIGINAL LP HAD *SPICKS AND SPECKS* AND FOR SOME REASON THEY REPLACED THE SONG *SPICKS AND SPECKS* WITH *TOMORROW,TOMORROW*. ............... BOB & PAIGE"
4,very good albumn...well worth having in my collection,one of the best albumns produced for those who love good music that blends harmony and meaning together....it is well worth adding to any collection of fine vocal groups and arrangments
3,Get the DVD Instead,"If you like these songs, get the DVD ""One Night Only"" where they peformed most of these with a good band an they sound GREAT."
3,best of the best,"This greatest hits album of 1969 really features all the best songs of the Bee Gees from 1967 tot 1969. I guess ""Tomorrow, Tomorrow"" must have been a single, done by Barry and Maurice when Robin went solo, that didn't go on an album that were released. I'm glad it came on this album in the place of ""Spicks And Specks"", because ""Spicks And Specks"" can be found on many albums, but not ""Tomorrow,Tomorrow"" and which is really a great song. Funny thing is that ""I've Gotta Get A Message To You"" and ""Words"" really sounds much different on this album, then on the ""The Very Best Of The Bee Gees"" album of 1990.Still, this is a great album if you're only interested in the very best hits of the Bee Gees from 1967 to 1969. It features the best songs from albums ""Bee Gees First"", ""Horizontal"" and ""Idea.""It's a must have - you'll hate it, if you haven't got it (Ha!)Bee Gees rules!"
4,"Bee Gees album is ""but good""","Delicately recorded and mournfully sung, these choice cuts from the early years of the Bee Gees belong in any serious record collector's stash.The ""hook,"" if you want to call it that, is ""Holiday,"" and ""I started a joke."" Both selections ask us to use our heads as to what the lyrics really mean. And somehow, it adds to one's enjoyment. Culled from master tapes before ""Saturday Night Fever,"" the cuts demonstrate musicality that is a departure from their disco peroid -- and they are simply refreshing to hear againn."
5,Proof that Bee Gees are much more than a disco dynamo,"The early Bee Gee's are so good, it's a shame their career is judged by the disco days only.2 songs sold me to early Bee Gee's Every Christian Lion Hearted Man Will Show You is just as good as the Moody Blues complete w/mellotron and gregorian chants way before enigma and actually before the moody blues.New York Mining Disaster- It's so good, it's like a lost Beatles song from Help or something."
5,One of the best collections put together in music history!!!,"This fine album should be in everyone's music collection. There is not one single bad track on this collection.All the songs on this collection are solid and memorable and most are played constantly on Oldie stations. The Bee Gees have so many hits that it would take a while to count them and are one of the best music acts in history. These tracks should be remembered by everyone first, before the ""DISCO hits. If this collection is not in YOUR collection, you have a big hole in the music library, these tracks are HISTORICAL!!"
2,very disappointed,"This was titled ""Best of Bee Gees"". However, there was not ONE Bee Gee song on the CD. They were all Beatles songs sung by the Bee Gees. To me this is false advertising of the CD. I got this for my husband who is a Bee Gee song fan and he was disappointed, along with me, when we listened to the CD."
3,Could be better...,"Well after reading the other reviews I thought this would be great. I do a lot of research on products to hopefully avoid mistakes. It seemed ok when I unpacked it. My first use on the grill is warped. I was cooking fish at the time. It did cook it good that's why I gave it 3 stars. It does return to it's un warped state after it cools. Don't know, if I had to do it over again I would pass on this one. Hope this helps someone else out there."
3,its OK,"This product serves its purpose, but was a bit shocked how it handles the heat from a grill. Not sure if anyone has had the same problem I have had, but the grill actually bent upwards causing a crease. Causes a bit of a problem when you have placed a few items on it to grill. besides that its just fine. Nothing really bad to say about the product but I think going forward I will stick with Weber made products."
3,Beware and make your own decision ! !,"I thought it was going to be a really cool thing to have, however when placed on the grill it warps and becomes very hard to clean ! !"
2,The Fizz That Went Flat,"O.k I'm a major book reader and I like to read mysteries, but this was a mystery, mystery and what I mean by that is the guy ""Guts"" Regan comes from nowhere then tells Karen Andre that Bjorn Faulkner is dead. And she is surprised... isn't that the reason you're on trial for murder? And then the end oh gosh somebody give the author some Gatorade so she can finish off strong next time. Why did it not have a true ending? Why did she have to make it so difficult to read? Was she guilty or not? Why did she put it in two diffrent perspectives rather than just give us a ""guilty"" or ""not guilty"" verdict?"
3,Diector's nightmare January 16th,"I am currently directing this play - opening on May 26th, 2000 at the Mayfair Theatre, Goodwood, South Australia.My first hassle is that I cannot locate the performing rights. Can anyone help?The remaining hassles are the clumsy language and bizzare interpretation of court room behaviour that Rand includes in her script. Granted that this was her first creative writing effort but really!Having done my homework and gathered as much material as possible about the writer I really can't like or admire this woman. Obviously Bjorn Faulkner, Karen Andre and their ilk are her heroes! Needless to say, this play is the company's choice - not mine. I intend, however, to ensure that our audiences enjoy the ""theatre"" of the piece by designing and setting the play adhering to the 1930's film genre for which it appears to be witten. A character(albeit deceased) called ""Lefty"" O'Toole indeed!"
5,Fantastic,"The author is a genius, and the logic is excellent. Each character's actions follow their conscious convictions. It is difficult to execute such logic unless the author is ruthless in depicting the actions based on the deep convictions of the characters.The pedantic nature of the law courts has been subverted for the plot. I doubt whether a lawyercould write such a compelling drama. Grisham is a pretentious amateur in comparison. The plot is the best feature, based on the logical consequences of the convictions held by the characters. This is definitely a book for anyone interested in Miss Rand's work."
1,What an awful script,"I've played the prosecuting attorney in ""Night,"" so I am all too intimately familiar with this pretentious, ham-fisted piece of dreck. The ""philosophy"" is insipid, the dialogue is stilted and purple to the point of self-parody, and the courtroom procedures are so wildly inaccurate that I doubt Rand even knew any lawyers. Even in the oeuvre of a writer as bad as Ayn Rand, this script stands out as a low point."
2,An extra star for convincing me that Objectivism is silly,"I read this play 35 years ago when I was in high school. I remember two things about it. First, there was not a single character in the play who behaved in a remotely believable manner. And second, the philosophy behind the play was completely inane and seemed to have been concocted by someone who had never interacted with people at all. As the title of this review says, the positive aspect is that I never felt the need to waste any more of my time reading Ayn Rand."
5,Keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times.,"We are performing this play at our High School(Davis High-Utah). We open on March 4, this coming Thursday. I play Magda Svenson, I love this character and I am so excited for this play. I am also excited to really actually ACT and show our school what we are made of. Every time we reahearse this play I love it even more. I ecspecially love Ayn Rands view of objectiveism, it is so cool. Thank you for this play and allowing me and my class to portray it to the best of our ability. Again Thank you and good-bye! From Hali Fifield"
4,I did like it. They botched the science though,"I did some research on worst case scenarios of complete ozone layer depletion and man did Abel botch it. If the ozone layer disappears completely tomorrow basically people will get sunburned very quickly and skin cancer will go off the charts. If we stay out of the sun, well, not a hell of a lot happens. There ain't no way ozone depletion melts the planet. Now on the other hand if the Earth's iron mantle stops rotating and we lose our magnetic shield... Then we melt from microwaves in moments. I think they confused the two protective fields.I liked the movie because it was an attempt to cast Armageddon in a different light. It's not about world cataclysm, rather how two individuals - and really one, for it's all about Cisco - try to keep a shred of meaning in the sheer hopelessness of the situation. Such an effort by its very nature would be indulgent and involve a lot of actor's shtick; and who better than Dafoe to provide it?"
1,"End of the world due to ""Global Warming"" and lots of Skype.","I find most apocalyptic films quite interesting. I also like watching Indie films. This one, however, is a real stinker. The world is ending due to the hole in the ozone - ""like Al Gore predicted"". This is mentioned over and over.The opening love scene was drawn out for far too long and was completely boring. I know they were shooting for a romantic, this-is-the-end-of-the-world-let's-make-love scene....but it simply didn't work.The sound of vehicles passing by thoughout the entire movie will have you looking out your window for unexpected visitors.Apparently Skype is still around when the end of the world happens and everyone is using it.The only believable ""apocalyptic scene"" is when a guy gives up and jumps off a balcony. The rest seems to be people doing normal daily stuff."
1,An awful movie,"Where should I begin? The trailer was good, so I bought the movie. It was a big mistake. Although there are some good actors in this movie, they do not rise above the poor script. There is a lack of continuity as this story moves along. This is without a doubt the worst doomsday movie I have ever watched. Save your money. You will not like this movie."
1,Boring people watching boring television before the end of the world,"A newscaster telling people to just be with their loved ones because it was all going to end - the scene is rather haunting in its own right. There is a sense of despair and giving up as everything is gone. That's a great moment but it's unearned. It's unearned because it is coming in the middle of a movie full of these non-action moments that are supposed to be haunting and mysterious but ultimately just prove dull and uninspired. Whether Willem Dafoe is going on the roof and yelling at people or they are ordering Chinese food, nothing is really happening in this things.If these moments were part of an overall story, great. But they are simply scenes from boring people in a nice apartment sitting around and waiting for things to end.Never has a movie depicted characters that are so in tune with the audience."
1,One of the worst movies in a long time.,I didn't believe the 2 stars and actually paid $$ to watch this.It was awful. The ending was horrible.So disappointed.Wait for this to be a part of the free prime or better yet... go watch something else.LOL
2,Very weak,"I like original or Avant-Garde movies, but this one was just self indulgent drivel. It stinks of the existential angst of some aging-baby-boomer-hippie-poser."
1,I Couldn't Wait for It To Be 4:44 So This Movie Would End!,"Pretentious. Irritating. Annoying. Uninteresting. What more could I write about a movie that was a complete waste of time, even though I fast forwarded it to the near end just so it would be the end of this bad, bad, movie. Don't waste your money or time. Al Gore? Give me a break! Zero stars! 0000000000"
1,No Hope,"A true picture of most of the percentage of the world that lives with no hope. So glad that the One that truly holds the Universe together is the one in control, not Al Gore and exestentialist filmakers. Willem Dafoe is one of my favorite actors, but........."
1,Most terrible waste of time & money.,"I agree with all the negative reviews. Wish I had read them before I rented it. I was bored. Willem Dafoe, Okay I'll give it a shot.Wrong! Spent most of the movie jumping ahead. Like other reviewers, I couldn't wait for the world to end."
3,Good movie,This movie could have been more gripping and intense. I was disappointed. I guess all the 5 stars made me to expect a lot more than I actually saw.
3,LOVED the flick!,"Yeah...it was a little plodding...kind of a self-indulgent, hip, groovy 'n cool art scene. However, the ending was quite beautiful with a spiritual ring. I suppose, being a New Yorker, I'm a bit biased 'cause I know the neighborhood well."
4,great for bedtime,we've had this DVD for nearly 2 years come Christmas. my son loved NEMO so much that I did a search and found this DVD. The music gets seriously tedious after the 1000th viewing - we turn off the sound and put in a soft CD instead. Great for toddlers and preschoolers needing wind-down time after books and prayers!
5,Not what I expected,Code names is exactly what it says. I can't express anymore to you than that.Missing alot in this book.
1,Arkin is a traitor,"""Intelligence?"" That's what every office pogue says he did. No matter. Some of those ops are still current. To reveal their existance is treason."
1,Disappointingly boring,I thought it was going to be really interesting. It makes you wonder who's writing the reviews on here. I'm returning my copy for a refund.
1,Treason,"U.S. CodeTITLE 18 > PART I > CHAPTER 37 > 794794. Gathering or delivering defense information to aid foreign government(b) Whoever, in time of war, with intent that the same shall be communicated to the enemy, collects, records, publishes, or communicates, or attempts to elicit any information with respect to the movement, numbers, description, condition, or disposition of any of the Armed Forces, ships, aircraft, or war materials of the United States, or with respect to the plans or conduct, or supposed plans or conduct of any naval or military operations, or with respect to any works or measures undertaken for or connected with, or intended for the fortification or defense of any place, or any other information relating to the public defense, which might be useful to the enemy, shall be punished by death or by imprisonment for any term of years or for life.Arkin is a Trator. He, his publisher, and anyone distributing this book should suffer the above mentioned penalties."
1,Arkin should be held for Treason,Books of this nature set a terrible trend- who is Arkinto determine what should be disclosed to the world andwhat should be kept TS as a matter of national security?This book reportedly contains information on ongoing operationsaround the world. While the majority of the book is supposedlyvery dry and disappointing in the information it discloses-I'm certain the enemies of our nation will be glad to weedthrough the majority to find nuggets of valuable information.If this book results in any deaths of even one of our military membersor allies Arkin should be imprisoned or executed for treason-and frankly AMAZON.COM should be ashamed to carry this book on it's shelves.Don't buy it- and don't encourage this form of stupidity.
2,Terribly Dry,"There is no story, just definitions and code words. There was nothing to hold my interest in the least."
1,Short end of the stick,"The product is well built. The mirror part is very largethe telescoping handle is very short almost making thistool unusable. Another thing to note is that the mirrordosent have 360 degree movement,only up and down.After buying this product i wish i had boughtone with a longer handle"
2,not quite right,"I bought these to replace a pair of Khombu boots I bought last year. It's amazing they look almost exactly the same. Unfortunately while the Khombu boots made my feet feel all warm, comfy and protected the Dinara Naturalizers are less comfortable and bite into my feet a bit and are not good for wearing for long periods of time."
3,Leather or Suede,"I recently purchase the Naturalize womens Dinara ankle boot. I was a little disappointed because the boots are suede, a little misleading. The boots are just ok for me."
4,Not leather,"There must be something wrong with their inventory because I also did not recieve a leather pair and when they sent a replacement, it was the same thing. If you are not looking for a leather boot, they are very comfortable and seem warm."
5,Delightful inspired stories,"The author, a dear friend of over fifty years, has brought some of the beautiful past back with ""Miss Rossie"" through humor and her love of God and His children. Just as his life was molded years ago through her caring, his remembrances bring much to the reader who finds that each delightful story inspires joy in living by truly loving one another."
4,feeling a little without,"I''ve been a follower of Holroyd's work for his whole career. Track #1 starts off with a blending and building array of beats and bushman tribal calls. Love it. Just enough tempo to get rhythmically stimulated. Games without Frontiers is a great song however I felt a little flat after hearing this version. I think my favorite track is Confluence. Great tribal Holroyd style, building and exploding into frenzy of beat, sound, and very hypnotic! Reawakening is nothing new--isn't that on a compilation somewhere? The Spaces in between is beautiful - probably my 2nd fav track on this cd. Lots more rhythm on this album compared to A Different Space. Of course, lots of horns. I love his relationship with horns and his usage of them. I really love how they bring the songs alive! Overall, I enjoyed the feeling that this album took me further along a journey, like the story of A Different Space simply continuing."
4,lots of fun,We got this chopper for our 5 year old on his birthday. He was alittle small for it at first. The chopper went so fast because of his size however after a few months he can really control it now. He loves it. We have had no problems so far. Adults can ride this chopper also. My father inlaw came to visit and had so much fun on it. We think if your interested in this at all you should get it. You wouldn't regret it.
3,electric chopper,"I bought this for my son on his 9th birthday. He just received this item yesterday as a gift. He thinks its very cool. I noticed the box states ages 12+, but it is very, very small. I dont really know how a 12 yr old could fit on this. The battery does not last very long, and then it has to be recharged again. I'm not sure how durable its going to be yet, hopefully, it will hold up."
1,if your buyin ur gettin ripped,"look if you want to get a mini pocket bike, or a pocket chopper i suggest that you dont buy this one. they dont run good, and fall apart easily, if you want a good pocket rocket that can go up to 40 mph you can get one for $170 on www.minipocketrockets.com"
4,Custom OCC Chopper,"this chopper goes pretty fast, i custom spraypainted the front rims blak and they look tite, i also got the OCC sign and spraypainted it onto the tank, i forgot wat its called but i also spraypainted the gray box that holds all the ellectrical stuff, blak, it looks baddass, and it rides smooth"
3,ahhhh BROKEN!,"so I buy it ride it for like a month and then I accidentally use my brothers 30 watt charger. After a day it totally broke/ Scooter not moving and lights do not work using battery, but lights do work when you plug the charger into the side of the scooter and also plug the charger into the wall-Scooter will not move at all and all lights do not work (lights do work when you plug the charger into wall) Razors tryin to help but now there sayin the chopper doesnt have a fuse and thats what the problem is/so says google"
1,Bummer,Bike did not run right from the beginning. THe battery did not stay charged. After awhile just quite running altogether. Company was not very usefull. Warranty only 90 days. Do not buy this peice of junk.
3,Nice !!,"I like these, they are very comfortible and easy to wear. Colors are great too. Only problem I find, and this goes for all your shorts, is that you dont give an inseam. They are a little short so I just wear them around the house. Please start putting the inseam with your shorts.Thanks"
2,Not For The General Reader,"This book is trying to give an overview of each of the twelve Roman Caesars. Overall I was looking for more of an exciting telling of the story with some action, suspense, and maybe a little decadence thrown in for good measure. What I got was a textbook best suited for a college campus. The writing was so labored I wondered why the author chose this line of work, recipes have more punch and creativeness in the writing. I truly struggled to get to the half way point of the book before I gave up. Now let me add that this is not a main interest topic for me so maybe my review is not reflective of a person that is really into the Roman's."
3,A Soundtrack That's ... Satisfactory,"This soundtrack is just that--satisfactory.Most reviews I've seen of this music by Jerry Goldsmith have complained that the composer relies heavily on synthesizers and not enough on a full orchestra. I would have to agree...but then, though it's kind of disappointing, it's not as if it was an accident; and what's all that bad about a synthesizer, anyway?I purchased this soundtrack because I'm a big fan of the movie, and the music works wonderfully there. The themes, though they might have sounded better with a full orchestration, are stirring, and the soundtrack is enough to remind you of them. If you're a soundtrack collector with a refined taste and high standards, this probably won't be anywhere near the top of your shopping list, but if you liked what you heard in the movie, this will be a good buy."
5,"I laughed, I cried, I jerked my back leg spasmodically ...","At last, a guide to the psyche of the dog that owns me."
2,Too sweet,Very sweet in a not good way. And I'm a sugar addict. Kinda want to get rid of them now......
2,Limited View,"This book, because of its size, offers a very limited view of the poetry of WWI. Don't think I would recommend it, although the selection does feature some of the best-known (if not best-written) poetry of WWI."
3,Meh.,"I enjoyed this read, but it's what I call a fluffy story: very sweet, but with little substance. The plot doesn't work well for me because it's very far-fetched (with a rock star bumping into a fan and randomly deciding to look the guy up) and I felt that the characters were a little under-developed as well. If your looking for a light read, it's a cute story, but there's no depth."
3,Unlikely That You Know That I Love You,"First, you have to get past the fact that the premise of this book is wildly, over the top, off the charts unlikely, implausible, unbelievable: Marky Mark falls for pudgy Indiana farm boy. Then there's the Boeing 747 that flies from Evansville to Chicago...please! Then there's the cover illustration that makes the star character look more like Secretariat than the hunk described within. Then there's the fact that iUniverse, the publisher, still is understaffed with editors and proofreaders, based on the number of spelling and grammatical mistakes, plus the author's irritating tendency to use ""that"" in place of ""who"". Once you get past all of that ... this is actually a cute story. Read it for a few hours of enjoyment, learn a bit about life on the road for a rock band, nod knowingly at the difficulties of coming out and keep looking for more sex than the one and only hot line on the 321 pages."
1,Sometimes you can judge a book by the cover...,"In this case I should have immediately been wary about the insides after a very amatuerish cover. The story was like a bad Harlequin romance - simple, two dimensional characters, the barest attempt at pacing and plot, and an obvious ending. I've heard that this author has fans?! Who would have thought? If you like your reading with meat and measure, I suggest the works of Heim or Grimsley and not Roeder."
3,Book needs a new title: 69-86,"This book is very detailed. The problem is that the vans changed significantly with the 1987 model. EFI, computer, gauges, headlights, and on and on. If you have a newer van (87+), you will want the Chilton's book that Amazon offers .Ford: Full-Size Vans 1989-96 (Chilton's Total Car Care Repair Manual)I ordered it as well and found it to be much more relevant for my 1990 E350."
1,Don't buy if yours is 1987 or newer!,"This book was a rip off for me. Other than a few useless add-on pages at the end, this book does not address 87-91 vans as stated. No useful info on EFI or later hydraulic clutch systems. Good if you own older vans."
5,Not for Beginners,"This is the second time I've purchased the Mico book/cd by Puder and Romer. The book covers installation { I've tried all but the AIX without trouble }, has a brief over-view of CORBA concepts, and does a quick run through of how to use CORBA and MICO in specific. It then walks through more code and explanation with some of the 'core' services one uses with CORBA. With a 195 page book do not expect a lot of hand holding. Enough information is provided for a self-starter to start climbing up the ladder of knowledge. Make sure you have at least a working knowledge of C++. On the other hand the sheer simplicity of CORBA makes the ladder a rather short one. Other than that, this is the most dog-eared book I have on CORBA! { Clienter/Server Programming with Java and Corba is the 2nd }"
2,Out of Date,"This text, and the associated CD ROM are outdated. This is expected for a book that describes a live technology, unfortunately there is no errata to be found, not even on the author's website.The Windows binaries on the CD do not run on XP. The source code on the CD does not compile under VC++ 7.0. The code generated by the most recent IDL compiler (2.3.11) is not described by the book (the book describes code generated from the older IDL compiler). I can not figure out how to map code generated by IDL to code the book describes. I have given up on this book."
2,Doesn't do a thing for flies,"After reading many positive reviews on other sites, I ordered this product for our barn...of two horses. It didn't do a think to alleviate our fly problem. However, since starting on this product two months ago my horses coats are extremely shiny. So that's a positive.Will I order it again for that? No, but they do look very nice next to other horses at shows."
4,Great product but expensive!,"I've been using the product for several years. It works. It does exactly what it says it will do. I just wish it was cheaper.Cyromazine, the active ingredient in SOLITUDE IGR, is an insect growth regulatorCyromazine is fed to the horse, passes through and is excreted in the manureHouse and stable flies lay their eggs in the manure and the eggs subsequently hatch into the larval or maggot stageAs the maturing maggots feed on the cyromazine treated manure, they become unable to successfully develop into adult flies because cyromazine inhibits the proper formation of chitin.The immature stage of the fly diesI dump my horse manure in large trash cans. I tried to go without this product for a few months a while back and my trash cans were filled with creepy crawly maggots. I continued to see these maggots until I restarted the Solitude. I've never doubted it's efficacy since!Probably would be useless in a boarding situation where only your own horses are on it."
5,What Am I ~~~ Crazy,this is one of the best live albums i own. clearly one of ozzy's best live albums next to tribute. I think that any ozzy fan new or old should have this album. p.s. listed to war pigs and paranoid they are the best and if you can hear these songs from black sabbath's paranoid they sound great
5,Speaking of Ozzy........,"This is an excellent live performance of Ozzy/Black Sabbath's greatest hits. What's cool is that there are many songs on this album that aren't normally found outside their original recordings. ""Never Say Die"", ""The Wizard"", and ""Symptom of The Universe"" are killer hits that deserved their place on the performance stage. Ozzy and Brad Gillis know just how to do these cuts justice, and bring down the house with their performance. This is a clear, distinct recording, even including Ozzy talking to the crowd in-between songs. For anyone who has gone to an Ozzy Osbourne concert ,or anyone who's never been able to make it, this album will get you into a head-banging, moshing mood."
5,The Best Black Sabbath Album,I grew up with eighties metal and always thought Black Sabbath wrote great music but their albums sounded terrible. This album is what I needed the sound is killer and Night Ranger guitarist Brad Gillis is is awesome really doing the laying into every song. With Rudy Sarzo and Tommy Aldridge this album has everything with killer sound and musicians.
4,Ozzy Does Sabbath,"This is a live album of Black Sabbath songs but with a differant hired band in 1982 in New York. Ozzy was Black Sabbath's singer from until 1979. Possibly the first Christian rock band as we know it today, despite a controversial reputation. Key tracks are: Black Sabbath, N.I.B., Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Iron Man and Paranoid."
2,A dated novelty item.,"Ozzy performs old Sabbath classics live! What could possibly go wrong? How about the lack of Tony and Geezer? The band, led by noted guitarist Brad Gillis, is skilled, but they are not Sabbath. There's very little chemistry in the playing, leading me to the sad conclusion that this is not much more than a novelty item of the same variety as Pat Boone's ""In a Metal Mood,"" or ""Apocalyptica Plays Metallica for Four Cellos."" It's not worth listening to more than a few times at the most. There are a couple tracks that rescue it from total oblivion. The relentless, mid-paced chugging version of Symptom of the Universe is more venomous and menacing than the frantic and screechy original rendition. The band's somewhat drunkenly drawling take on Sabbath Bloody Sabbath is welcome as well. Download them individually; leave the rest of this relic to moulder."
2,generic covers with no crunch,"What makes Tony Iommi so great is that anyone who tries to cover his songs sounds so weak in comparison. Brad Gillis' trebley sound just does not have the impact of Iommi's chainsaw vibratto. Also, Sarzo could'nt carry Geezers jockstrap(to use a sports metaphor), he was nothing but a poser. These renditions lack the intensity that only Iommi can bring to them. Take for example the uninspired version of Snowblind. Its obvious Brad Gillis could care less, and really, why should he? He was a good player who sounded just like a million other guitarists at the time. Gillis just does not came close to Iommi's wall of sound, sledgehammer approach that makes his compositions stand out from the pack. Ozzy is Ozzy and his vocals sound fine, but to suggest that this effort was anything but a money grab is to deny the obvious."
5,Brad Gillis smokes on this album,"The best of all OZZY live recordings in my opinion! Brad Gillis puts his signature on old Sabbath songs and does a great job. The band sounds good, Ozzy could sound better, but overall this whole album is great."
4,Brad Gillis can play guitar!,"I know it is fashionable for the hardcore Sabbath fans to dog this album. It is Ozzy doing Sabbath songs without Tony and Geezer. However, that does not bother me. In this album, Ozzy makes these Sabbath songs his own, largely by incorporating one of the hottest guitar players of the day, Brad Gillis. Gillis is not Tony, he is Brad. Different approach and different sound. They are both great. I love the shredding that takes place here, it sounds as if Randy was still playing with Ozzy. The only drawback is that Ozzy does sound out of it when conversing with the crowd (the song ""Snowblind"" is appropriate). But the musicianship is incredible. If you like truly great guitar-work, this is the album for you."
3,Motivational at best,"Mr. Cossman probably inteaded this book to help others on the road of financial prosperity through a home based mail order business. However he falls well short by only going into little detail on many areas instead of great detail in some areas. If you are looking for a wonderful motivation tool than this book is for you. However, if you are looking to make a million I suggest you purchase something else."
4,Basics Don't Change,The basics of marketing don't change. Cossman was one of the great marketing gurus. He gives you ideas you would never think of. Much of his mail order basics apply today to the internet.
1,Super Outdated! There are Better Books to Learn From!!!,"Here's the deal: If you are serious about making money in mail order or direct response, don't get any of these waste-of-time books that ""claim"" to show you the business. The ONLY book that I've ever read that can (almost) exactly mirror exactly what I do for my $7-million per year business is a book by Vincent James called The 12-Month Millionaire which you can get on eBay (or type in on a search engine) since it's not a regular published book. The only thing I wouldn't follow in that book is the low priced items he recommends selling like wrinkle creams and weight loss pills (stick with information courses of $199+ with mail order as a RULE, ALWAYS). Lower end products of $99 or less will cause you to lose money in mail order EVERY TIME!!"
1,Copyright date is VERY misleading,"With a copyright date of 1993, I was expecting this book to be a little dated. If you look carefully at the copyright page, however, you'll notice that the original copyright date is 1964 with another edition in 1984. This version isn't really a new edition, it's simply a hopelessly outdated waste of time.Frankly, I am shocked that Simon and Schuster would publish and promote such a worthless, outdated re-tread of a book. This certainly makes me think less of their brand."
1,more BS hype,Cossman serves up a bunch of hype that has little or no contact with the real world that he claims to have made it in. THis guy is so full of himself you wonder why the EPA hasn't declared him a walking toxic waste site! Save your money and your time - this book is only a waste of good trees and ink.
1,Are re-runs worth the money?,"Someone wanted to make a buck without coming up with a new book, and I confess I bit. OUCH! The short stories in this book are all cute, but I couldn't find one I didn't recognize: they are taken from the ""oral histories"" collected in the regular series, so if you are an avid fan, you have read these already. Do we really need all the ""yarns"" in one place? I think they add flavor to the mysteries, and are just fluff on their own. (Supposedly there is one short that is original, but it blends right in!)"
2,Stories don't cut it,"These 27 sketches or stories by Qwill, i.e. Braun, just aren't worth reading. They are superficial and self-consciously ""cute,"" in almost every case. Perhaps Qwill just doesn't write as well as Braun. There's nothing more to be said."
2,A minor companion,"Not as good as the ""Cat who..."" books themselves. Still, an easy read and not unenjoyable."
1,Just doesn't cut the mustard,"I tried to read the whole book. I tried with all my might, but after reading half the tales in this book, I felt like hurling it out the window. I found most of the endings annoying or perplexing. I was always hoping the next story would be better -- much better. But each story was just as bad as the previous one. I'm exceedingly disappointed with this book. That's too bad because the picture on the cover is awfully nice!"
1,Lame,"Unhappily, this is a rather lame attempt to cash in on the popularity of her ""Cat Who..."" series. The series itself, whileentertaining to many, is rather tame and plain, so this slimmed-down version of some ""local"" folk lore from the same locale isjust too weak to be sustainable.These tales are very short, and while that itself is not a criticism, the reader will search in vain for anything of valuehere.At bottom, there is simply no substance here at all in any ofthe little stories, and the only reason most readers will even bother going on to the next one is the hope that it will be better than the one just left. But any hope is quickly dashedas the stories continue on in a very low-level attempt to seemfolksy. There is just no substance, no real style, no interesting characters, no truths, and no fun.Please don't waste your time with this."
5,Completing Cat Who Collection,This was the last book I needed to complete the Cat Who collection written by the late Lillian Jackson Braun. It arrived in good condition and on time. Thank you.
2,"Too short, not tall enough","I was really disappointed by this latest entry into ""The Cat Who"" series. I've been getting a little tired of the series anyway, but I thought this might really be something different, something fun. It wasn't nearly as good as I had expected. These tales are slight at best, and mere sketches at worst. I was hoping for something meaty with some depth. Even she wanted to write some short stories, did they have to be this short? I don't really understand the whole point of this book. I think the idea was to just present some sketches that portray a certain mood, and if that's what you're looking for, you may enjoy the book. There are some good stories. I liked the one about the blacksmith and the story of the horseradish ship. But both could have been developed a little more. The opening story was pretty pointless, in my opinion. Altogether disappointing in almost every way."
1,"Lifeless, dull and boring","I couldn't get past the first few tales. They left me feeling.... nothing. Reading the back of a cereal box would have been more exciting. I would definately not recommend this book. As a fan of Earlene Fowler and Monica Ferris. I thought I might enjoy ""the cat who"" series but if this book is any indication of the author's writing, I'll pass."
3,Retelling of 'tales' from the CAT WHO series,If you are a fan of the series (as I am) you have probably already read these tall tales in the series itself. If you are not already familiar with the series you might enjoy the stories in and of themselves but will probably not 'get it' that the author is a fiction character or the references to Moose county.This is an acceptable book for a lazy day read or to take with while waiting for an appointment but it is basically a way for the publisher to separate fans of the series from their money.
1,Another sappy whine-fest.....,"Despite what some here say, this guy is an insufferable whiner. One song after the other is filled with meek, timid and just plain 'ol irritating whining and wimpering. Put simply, here is the cure for insomnia. He makes some of the other current whiners like ""Five for Fighting"" or ""3 Doors Down"" actually look not too bad.We need to take up a collection for poor John. Sappy, wimpy and testosterone-deficient is no way to go through life."
2,Room for what?!,"John Mayer's ""Room For Squares"" has been recorded with little imagination. At first, you'll get excited thinking that you'll get more songs like ""Love Song For No One"" or ""No Such Thing"" but honestly halfway through the album can get you dozing off to wonderland. 2 stars for the light voice Mayer has and another one for the effort, but the album (for me) failed to create an impression and I thought that after listening to the whole CD over and over again, it will soon grow on me, but it wasn't to be. ""Room For Squares"" must be substituted with an album from Rob Thomas or Stephan Jenkins from Third Eye Blind. Try those two instead. Mayer is nothing special."
2,I try to be open minded,"I am usually open minded when it comes to music, i saw him play on tv, i think it was jay leno. He seems to know what hes doing with his guitar, but his voice is just plain annoying. I tryed to listen to the whole song, but i couldn't. Changed the channel, went back, changed the channel, and so on. I gave him 2 stars because his guitar playing sounded good. Maybe i'm just not a fan of that kind of music."
5,Phil Collins anyone?,"To me,mayer sounds more like phil collins,not dave. compare the sound when they go high in ""I cant walk"" and ""No Such thing""...very similar.thank you."
3,Buy This CD,"Dave Matthews vocal wannabe??? (...) This is a great album, period. In the day when popular music is suffering at an all time low, this new release from a REAL singer/songwriter is a very pleasant departure from the painfully bland music we are forced to hear anytime a radio or television is turned on. (...)"
3,"Been there, heard that.","Don't let the title of my review let you believe that this is not a quality CD, it is. I just don't see it as anything new. ""Why Georgia"" & ""Wonderland"" are both great tracks and pretty much force you to sing. However the rest of the album leaves much to be desired. The lyrics are dry at times and the CD starts to draw itself towards the middle, average."
3,A WARM NEW SOUND FROM A TALENTED MUSICIAN,"I really like this CD. It's not super but better than a lot of the bubblegum junk out there. John Mayer's music has a lot of heart. Room for Squares has some great songs, my favorites ones are No Such Thing and 83. John's music is soothing and his voice's warmth wraps around you like a blanket. Some of his lyrics are a tad bit cliche, but I'm hoping that by his next CD his lyrics will have evolved some more. GRADE:B+"
4,Greater than the Sum of Its Parts,"This debut is one of those unusual albums in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Mayer is a young recording artist who writes catchy, well-crafted, tends-to-grow-on-you pop songs with workmanlike lyrics. He has a pleasant, albeit monochromatic voice-- resembling Dave Matthews and/or Marc Cohn (without quite the soul) crossed with Michael Franks and/or Kenny Rankin (without quite the chops). He plays a very tasty guitar and is backed by a fine corps of musicians. The music here is easy-listening, vanilla pop, with unobtrusive yet uninspired arrangements and production. Nevertheless, it is a relaxing, insinuating, and enjoyable listen; a nice balance to the edgier, moodier stuff we normally prefer; and, in its own subtle way, quite unlike anything else we've heard lately. Maybe its the harsh times we are living in, but we're surprised how frequently we have found this in our CD player."
2,One So-so Song and That's It,"John Mayer sucks. The garbage that I refer to is Your Body Is A Wonderland and every other song on the album. A blantant attempt to lure in female fans. A musician friend of mine once complimented Metallica for being successful with zero ""chick factor"". This song is all chick factor and explains the relentless comparisons to the older but equally boring Dave Matthews. He also loses points for that stupid entrance on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame where he, Gwen Stefani and Steven Tyler collectively ruined the Police's reunion by singing ""backup"" front and center..."
4,very promising songwriter,"I'm a NY based jazz musician who listens to a lot of radio, and when I heard ""No Such Thing"" late at night on an alternative station, which I think was before the record really ""hit"", I was really impressed- it has one of the best chorus hooks I've heard in a pop tune in a long time. So I bought the record, and I have to say- if CDs could wear out, my copy would be. The melodies really stick with me, and while maybe the lyrics aren't quite at the level yet of say, Joni Mitchell or something, give the kid a break- he's still in his 20s! I think it really is a terrific record, with truly little filler and some very memorable and heartfelt tunes. Also impeccably produced, with great guitar playing. And check out that nostalgic synth line on ""'83""- it totally took me back to that time. Moreover, anyone who can write a line like ""one pair of candy lips and your bubblegum toungue"" is alright with me! I'd love to play with this guy."
1,"More like John ...-er, tee-hee!","I don't normally write negative reviews, but come on people! This clown was influenced by Stevie Ray Vaughan? Funny, I don't recall Stevie Ray Vaughan aiming his music straight at yuppies and preppies, or singing songs with laughably overwrought titles like ""Your Body is a Wonderland."" I mean, I'm not just another mainstream hater, but this guy is so bland and inoffensive he makes the Dave Matthews Band look like Slayer! Life for most of us is mundane enough, I don't really think we need music like this to make it even more so. Get a Queens of the Stone Age album for Pete's sake."
1,0 stars...Music for Squares...Hahahaha,"I heard John Mayers song ""Your Body Is A Wonderland"" on the radio and I busted a gut laughing! This is boring, bland elavator music ( something your grandma would like). This is definetly music for the average ""square""!! This actually makes my Eminem album look refreshing! Don't waste your money on this album IT's [bad]!"
1,"Great guitar, awful singer and performer","I too can't understand how anybody likes this guy. I first heard him on ACL as well, and thought ""what is he saying???"" I couldn't (and still can't) understand a word that he sings. It wasn't until I heard a DJ say ""Your Body Is Wonderland"" that I could figure out the title of that song. Then I saw him on a PBS special and admit... he's an awesome guitarist. But I can't get over his horrible mumbling voice, and the fact that his stage presence... oh dear... he's soooo hard to even look at with his goofy facial expressions (is he in pain? passing gas? I can't tell) and his awkward mannerisms. That makes trying to understand the lyrics even more difficult.I guess he's either a love-him-or-hate-him kind of performer based on what I read here. I have to give him a thumbs down."
1,Awful,There's really great music being made today but you won't find it from this poseur. Do yourself a favor and do a little research and find something satisfying in this genre. Joni Mitchell's Court and Spark might be a good place to start.
3,Great CD,I bought this CD after I saw him win many Grammy awards years ago and found that I loved his music!
4,Solid,This a solid album. I can listen all the way through. Better than his newer stuff. I would definitely recommend it.
1,Great Album - not iPod Friendly,"I love this album, but was really disappointed that my CD-Rom Drive in my computer won't even recognize the audio side of the album. That's because, as I gather, I have iTunes installed and apparently it doesn't like iPods. So for that, I give the Dual Disc 1 star. I don't see why I cannot enjoy the tunes I buy in a format (or device) of my choice.I did like the DVD featurette of John's home video of recording the album/touring/about to hit it big. A nice time capsule."
1,Dumpster for Squares,"I could have been force-fed broken glass. I could have walked on hot coals for a mile straight. I could have watched the Fox News Channel for over 2 hours straight. Any of those experiences would have been better than listening to this drivel.I went to a party the other night and someone had this album playing on the stereo. I cannot overemphasize how horrible this album is; how in the world this won a Grammy award is beyond me. When I first heard ""No Such Thing"" way back during the summer, I thought he sounded like Dave Matthews, only with the serial numbers filed off.""Room For Squares"" needs to be retitled to ""Dumpster For Squares,"" because that's where someone needs to put Mayer."
2,I Don't Get it...,"...perhaps because I am not a college age female pop fan. I agree with the reviewer who calls him a Backstreet Boy with a guitar. There is very evident musical talent, but it is lost amidst vapid lyrics and pop cliches. ""Your Body is a Wonderland"" comes nowhere close to the kind of sensuality found in Dave Matthew's Band's ""Crash"" it seems trying to attain. I really liked ""No Such Thing"" when I first heard it, but it has lost its appeal with repeated listening. The rest of the CD just didn't appeal to me or really catch my attention. Hopefully John will continue to develop his songwriting skills to go along with his playing talent."
4,John Mayer makes the album,"Having grabbed all of his songs online months and months ago, I finally broke down and bought the official album. I was expecting a CD bursting with John Mayer's lyrics and guitar melodies, and I was a little disappointed to find that the simple acoustic versions I'd come to love had been altered with drum and tinny-sounding guitar accompaniments. Some of the songs I've found myself completely skipping over, unable to get past the cluttering musical instruments that seem at times to drown the original song. Still, even the worst musical instruments couldn't mask John Mayer's wonderful vocals and melodies, and the previously unreleased songs were a very welcome addition. If you've never heard any of John's acoustic stuff, you'll be more than pleased with this album."
3,easy listening for the alternative set,"You can almost hear the gutteral hiss of the capuccino makers in the background as you play this album, I swear -- this is such generic genY cafe soundtrack music. And I was so hopeful when I bought it! It's pleasant, sure -- and competent, and even good in a couple places -- but mostly pretty cheesey, and too deliberately evocative of other artists with more artistry to be worth all the acclaim it's getting. Most of the songs are better enjoyed as background, they don't stand much close attention. I'm with the Rolling Stone wag who said that ""Your Body is a Wonderland"" was a much better song when it was called ""Crash"" by the Dave Matthews Band."
4,Good Stuff BUT..,Don't get me wrong John Mayer makes good music and ya ya the whole Dave Matthews comparison???BUT can anyone say BIG HEAD TODD AND THE MONSTERS??? This sounds EXACTLY like BIG HEAD TODD AND THE MONSTERS and they have been creating GREAT music like Mayer since the late 80's. Its just ashame the BIG HEAD TODD AND THE MONSTERS are so underrated and unappreciated. Like I said Mayer has good stuff but let's not forget his sound has been around. It's ALL-relative
4,"Good, but Could be Better","This was a good CD, but not necessarily worth full price. His single ""No Such Thing"" isn't really a good indicator of the whole CD. Its more acoustic then that. Overall, a good listen."
5,What I have been waiting for....,"Having ground to a halt with my music and very little out there to keep me going, i stumbled over this absolute GEM.Put it in the car, in the living room have it in every room.I was singing this in no time and can't put the thing down.Clever lyrics, foot tapping tunes, and a few to howl in the bath. Quite simply, ""you cannot fault it !""."
1,...,"Just add 4 guys and you have N'SYNC. I bought this cd for my girlfriend because I heard that it was sentimental and stuff, but that was the biggest mistake of my life. His songs are terrible. I hear all this stuff that his lyrics are genius as is his record. Honestly, have you listened the words. The guy sings about georgia and neon. I will give him one thing, he is a good guitar player, but brilliant he is not. This is a piece ... aimed to the likes of college radio and 17 year old girls. When listening to this I wanted to .... John Mayer isnt brilliant, his lyrics are not that good, and he cant sing good at all. Please in the name of all that is good in the world, dont buy this, I beg of you. Hes not that good, it is just superficial rock with no point."
5,Amazing! Shows good future on the horizon...,"I first heard this cd long ago and I fell in love with it. Mayer has a similar voice to fellow soft rocker Dave Matthews, yet his music is very distinctive. Every song brings a lyrically powerful melody to life. This cd is definitley one of the best I have heard in a long time, and I am eager to see what Mayer can pull out of his bag of tricks to back this up. If he succeeds with an excellent follow up cd, he will no longer be labeled a Dave Matthews rip off. He will have made his own mark in the music biz..."
4,Great guitar and cruising music!,"By now, you've probably all heard his music on the radio. ... I don't like DM. I DO like this offering. Great guitar work, original voice and interesting style. Upbeat songs with lighter side lyrics.... that's what I look forward to at the end of the day and don't want anyone screaming at me from my CD player in the car! ..."
3,Disappointed in the Mix,"I heard some cuts from a John Mayer CD and ran down to the store to get my copy. I bought ""No Room For Squares"" because it was the only Mayer CD offered and had the songs titles I recognized. I had been duped. ""No Room ..."" has none of the feeling or definition of ""Inside Wants Out"" (which is the acoustic CD I had first heard). The mix on ""No Room..."" is so schlocky it takes away all the effect of Mayer's great music. I would definintely recommend ""Inside Wants Out"", not ""No Room..."""
2,Sub-Par,"I like John Mayer's music, so this isn't a stab at that. The cd just did not live up to my expectations. His acoustic versions of songs are a lot better in my opinion than what is on the cd. The ""Your body is a wonderland"" sounds awful next to the acoustic version. The one really redeeming song on it was ""My stupid mouth."" It is really catchy and fun, and sounds good electric. The tone of the other songs needs an acoustic guitar to really get the full effect."
5,Get a New Reviewer!,"This is one of the best CD's I've heard in years and I think it plays to young and old alike- the sound is a cool, mellow, jazzy blend that sticks to your ribs. I think the Dave Mattews comparisons are way overblown. To put Mayer in a box with DMB and David Gray pegs him as unoriginal which is just dead wrong. It is his originality that is so inspiring!I've burned a whole through this CD- it does not get old and I've passed it along to several friends, all who rave! Definately, a bust buy!"
2,Room for originality.,"The music's decent, some would say good. Points off for cheating. There are too many similarities to Dave Matthews to be coincidental. Watch tapes of the two performing. It reminds me of Belushi and Cocker on Saturday Night Live. Add some brass, a fiddle, and it could be a good tribute band. The Mave Datthews band, Maybe?"
5,the best cd alive,"fyi i'm not under 13 i just did that cuz i didn't feel like logging in. Any way this is the BEST CD EVER! I love john mayer, if i could i would give this cd an infinite amount of stars, there is something about his voice that soothes me, but doesn't put me to sleep, like when i've had a bad day i turn the music on and it soothes me, and even when i'm working on my work it makes me feel much more relaxed and focused and i'm not distracted from my work. Also for all those guys out there ""your body is a wonderland"" turns me and other girls on. Buy this cd and u WONT regret it"
3,Surround mix sounds weird,"I loved that they also released this album in 5.1 surround, but I was expecting the mixes to be similar to the ones on ""Heavier Things"".It starts great until it reaches ""Neon"". Seems to me that some elements of the song are missing (or mixed way too low), like a synth that you hear on the chorus (of the stereo mix).And 3x5 is even more weird, with a two-note plucking acoustic guitar loop that is (intentionally) burried on the stereo mix here is mixed louder on one of the sides and it's distracting.I still think it's worth buying because of the songs that DON'T sound strange on the surround mix and the video bonus."
4,Got the Potential,"I was at a music store looking for some jazz CD's when I heard a very familiar voice being played in the listening station of the music store. I thought it was the jazz singer Michael Franks. I was pleasantly surprised to note that it was John Mayer. Never heard him before. I bought the CD for a steal. Just 7 $. Sony CD's were on sale. Value for money. This CD is very impressive. John's vocals has a hint of jazz but it also combines the essential elements of rock, blues & a hint of soul as well. The track Neon appealed to me the most. This guy's worth a listen most definately !"
2,too mellow for me,"i bought this cd on a recommendation from a friend and i had it before there was any radioplay of john mayer. to be honest, i couldn't even listen to the whole cd. he sounds too much like the dave matthews band. it was way too mellow and redundant. it just made me sleepy when i listened to it. i ended up giving it away to someone else who would appreciate it."
4,Brown Bag? That's so wasteful.,"Although I agree with the Dave Matthews-esque sound as part of the review, that doesn't throw me from the great guitar work and vocal soothness that John Mayer offers... And yes, I had a lunchbox, and I wish I still had it. Personally I wasn't a brown bager like the reviewer is suggesting everyone else is or was. Either way... I Love the music."
5,ROCKY,"Could it be the swift guitar chords, or the soulful lyrics. For any reason, John Mayer's Debut album, ""Room For Squars"" shows off the ability of a young man all packaged in one Cd. Many songs such as, No such Thing, are surely radio/top 40 hits, and MY stupid mouth is so true. YOu can relate to this CD to your everyday life. It has surely changed mine. :D"
5,One of the best albums I've ever heard...,"Music, voice, and lyrics...what else needs to come together to make a beautiful album? I'm not too sure what the Amazon.com reviewer's problem is, but it's obvious he just has some kind of grudge toward the album or just doesn't ""get"" it...which is fine, we don't all have to like everything. But I seriously recommend everyone listening to this album somehow and deciding on their own if they like it, because it is simply amazing. This is one of those albums where literally every song is great, and I don't think you'll be disappointed. (Of course, it's not for everyone, but if you are even bothering to read these reviews, you are probably into this type of music, and you will like it.)"
1,"God, I hate you so much John Mayer","Why would anybody like this guy? He's so amazingly bad! He slurs his words, has horrible lyrics, and makes me physically ill. Sure, he might be skilled at playing the guitar, but does that matter when he has the most irritating voice and lyrics ever? It makes me so angry to see his video, with him making out with a hot chick. I should be doing that! Man, how do people get to like this guy? I give up!"
1,Pure torture,"I find it extremely hilarious that the media hypes this guy up to be some sort of intelligent singer/songwriter who people should take seriously. This music is flat-out sappy, saccharine, safe, middle of the road junk. It's for the suburban, trendy, crowd who don't like to be challenged musically because their brains are incapable of handling it. The song ""Your Body is Wonderland"" wreaks of Michael Bolton! John Mayer is too feminine. He plays the sensitive type to attract mindless legions of female fans who know jack about real music!! Oh well, while the mainstream crowd keep listening to this sappy pop piffle i'll stick to my Nirvana, Bob Marley, Beatles, The Clash, albums. You know....music that's innovative and creative? Something sorely missing in todays mainstream music culture."
5,Why Haven't You Bought This Yet?,"My friends are getting sick of hearing about it, so are my colleagues. I've been playing this CD non-stop since I bought it and have since recommended it to all of my friends. His lyrics are insightful and mature, his guitar licks are contagious, his melodies are infectious. ""City Love"" moved me to tears, even though it's not a sad song.He subscribes to the Dave Matthews method of marketing which is to allow his fans to tape his shows. He is also a fan of MP3 websites, describing them as the mix tape of the new millenium. I bought his CD because his talent amazes me and he deserves my money. You should do the same if you're so moved."
5,WONDERFUL CD:,"It's rare to hear such a well written and ""honest"" ( Not sounding pop or fake) CD. John Mayer's raspy voice cuts through the backgroung guitar straight to your heart with this CD that leaves you wondering what he'll do next."
3,square pegs,"Mr. Mayer is a talented boy. This CD is full of tunes that should be played in the car with the top down traveling down an open road in the summer. One thing that this CD lacks is depth, I am sure we will see Mayer show he is capable of finding it, just not on this one. A few more recordings down the road I think we will find a very talented young artist. But for pure, head bobbing, stereo up to 10, sing-a-longs, Room for squares is a good choice."
5,My New Favorite Disc,"Think Michael Franks, but more ""poppy."" Think Dave Matthews, but not trying so hard. Think Seal, but not as deep or ethereal. Listen, this is just great music. No big deal, not gonna change your life. But it will make you beam from ear to ear with every listen. The musicianship is top-notch and the recording is pristine. My only beef with the recording is that it's a little bright, but the warm, accurate, and ""live"" bass and midrange are wonderful.This is fun music. You probably won't sit and listen critically like you might a great jazz or classical disc, but you'll find it being left in your player more days at a time than you ever imagined. And if you play it at a party, (which it is perfect for), there will be an ever-forming line directly to you of people asking, ""Hey, who is this... this is so great!!"""
3,Pretty good mellow tunes,"I purchased this CD after seeing the video and reading some good reviews on this site. John Mayer definitely shows a lot of promise but I have to admit that I was disappointed in the CD. Quite frankly the songs all sounded quite a bit alike and the whole vibe of the album was too mellow for me. Now, I like soft rock but this just didn't do too much for me. Maybe I'll like his next installment better but I think I'll sample a few songs first before I buy it. I seriously doubt that I'll listen to this album for very long.I recently also purchased Ryan Adams' Gold and Pete Yorn's somethingforthemorningafter. Of these promising artists, I much preferred the Pete Yorn CD. There are some great rock songs on there and I liked the variety he showed."
4,"How Wrong You are, Rickey Wright!","This is a really nice, relaxing and enjoyable album. John's voice is smooth and sweet. I do not purport to be a music officianodo, nor to I claim to have the talent to rate one musician against another. However, I do know what I like to listen to and what I don't. I enjoyed this CD for it's own uniquness and fresh sound and appeal. ""No Such Thing"" is a very fun and light tune and was the tune that prompted me to buy the CD. The rest of the tracks I considered a bonus. Buy this CD. You can't go wrong. In fact, my 17 year old daughter even liked it. So, from this 42 year old woman who knows what sounds good, enjoy! Don't let the Rickey Wright's steer you wrong!!"
1,Reminds Me Of A Post-Funeral Pep Talk,"All the lyrics are trite self-involved forms of consolation that don't seperate him much from a studio musician or lyricist. I've been moved more by Disney soundtracks. He lacks any passion and everything recorded sounds like somebody held a gun to his head and forced him to write this album. Not much seperates him from Celine Dion or Barbara Streisand except his consistent mediocrity.Seriously, the only people that would be upset by this review are the ones that confuse physical attraction with musical talent. If he had the latter, we'd be hearing much more about his sophomore album.If you like his hit single, I'd recommend listening to Ben Lee or Promise Ring."
3,Good company!!,"I got my product very quickly from them, I really enjoyed buying the CD from their company, the waiting period was almost nil.--Wendi"
5,A step back from the noise...,"I read all the negative reviews directed towards Room for Squares and thought to myself, ""these folks must be missing something!"" John's writing and musical styles are not tailored for the 21st century norm of loud, complicated, and tacky songs overcrowded with attempts to sell sell sell. What his music does provide is a step away from the noisy rush of our society to explore the winding emotional rollercoaster that engulfs our mid-20's. Each song specifically targets a time in life where one steps back and evaluates ""where am i going?"" If you are looking for the answer, then you will be disappointed. But if you can appreciate the question, then you will love this album."
5,John Mayer is on his way up--and with good reason!,"I have no idea what is wrong with the Amazong reviewer, but I had the privilege of seeing John in concert last night after the insistance of my friends and I am wowed by his amazing vocal and musical talent. I was an instant fan. His songs are amazingly catchy but not trite---original and multi-layered. I could really tell that he loved his music as he beautifully sang and I could see his fans loved him too as they sang every word. Room for Squares is an awesome CD with not one song that I skip over. Great guitar, great voice. What more could I ask for?"
5,Why can't I find a guy like John Mayer?,"Don't be turned away by the unjustifiable review given on this site, this is an incredible album. John Mayer has a definite uncanny ability to construct poignant songs and masterfully handle his guitar. The only negative aspect of this cd is the fact that there just don't seem to be enough guys out there like this young singer/songwriter. (Oh, and about the Dave Matthews' comparison, give me a break! Now I am not going to say anything about DMB, because I know that would only get me in trouble, but John Mayer is a totally different type of artist.) So, yeah, give it a listen, it is really good!"
5,Just Great Music,"I came across this CD and loved it the minute I put it in! This guy is really, really talented and sticks out in a recent sea of sound-alike singers and songwriters. He's got a unique and great voice and songs that stick in your head like glue. You can't miss this!!"
4,This is a consistant album.,"What I mean by that is if you buy cd's for their singles, then this is a good one to get. It's just like ""Your Body Is A Wonderland"" and ""No Such Thing"". Some of the songs are more acustic, but that's not always bad. John Mayer has a excellent voice and range. To sum up, this is a good album."
1,"Boo for ""Squares""...","The Dave Matthews comparison is quite relevant. Here is a guy that is playing and singing music directly targeted to the post-hippie Matthews contingent. He brings nothing new to the table, only his apparent Berklee education. Guess they didn't teach him how to write decent songs, did they?I for one think that up until the recent Glen Ballard-produced ""Everyday,"" Matthews and Co. were marking their own trail. If Mayer has his way (and he's been a hit with the frat boys so far), he'll get a chance to tread the same ground. I don't care if you're Jimi Hendrix - if you don't at least attempt to create something that is uniquely yours, you've invalidated your art. Mayer not only doesn't try that here, he shamelessly drinks from the same well as every other college-age singer-songwriter. I don't mind if people like his music, I just don't wanna hear them tell me he's up to something ""hip"" or ""cool"" or ""edgy."" This is the same old song."
3,Nothing Wrong with Simple Acoustic Guitar,"I like John Mayer's music. It's simple, acoustic, and there is an all around goodness in his voice. Most of the songs on Room for Squares are quite sober, but that's a good thing. John's voice goes right along with the soberness of the songs. His voice is smooth and soothing, and flows right along with the instrumentals which is mostly combined of his own guitar and occasionally a piano or another extraneous instrument. It seems as if his style of making music is writing his feelings down on paper, picking up the guitar and finding the right tune, and calling it song. And there's no negativity in that here on Room for Squares. Every song works. Although I do have my favorites. Those being his first single No Such Thing, and My Stupid Mouth, Your Body Is a Wonderland, Neon, Not Myself, and St. Patrick's Day. I say, if John Mayer continues to make music, I will continue to listen."
4,Weclome to the music world,"A highly recommended, well-produced debut album. The music is rich and fresh, the contrived squarish image hurts the lyrics a bit, but the voice and the music compensate.The main question -- can he top this one with his next album. Now's the time to see John in concert in small venues. Hopefully this fellow will go far."
5,catchy songs,"Room For Squares has got to be one of the best albums released in the last few years. The catchy tunes are topped off with neat lyrics which make John Mayer stand out from modern lyricists. He gives his best in this record and after a few listens the songs seem very familiar: the signs of a great songwriter. The music is crafted for the song is not over the top at all. In fact, in a few parts he seems to be holding back from telling the whole story both musically and lyrically. This makes the CD's listenablilty unique, especially compared to other similar pop artists. To get the full story of John Mayer, seem him live. The CD is nice but his live performance is awesome. Either way, the way at which Room For Squares was crafted is something special that everyone can appreciate."
5,wow is all i can say.....,"*Listen up! I have been a JM fan for quite a long time now, before he became popular, and i just have to say that he is one of the most talented, true, real artists of our time. This guy is going to be around for a while! He has honest lyrics that are deep yet light hearted and it's totally easy to listen to. If you haven't purchases RFS yet, i highly reccommend it. Plus he also ""inside wants out"", a more acustic album that lets his guitar abilities shine. *"
5,THIS IS SOO GREAT,"With the exception of some older No Doubt albums, this is the only cd that i can sit through without getting bored. He has a great voice and poignant lyrics that apply really heavily to my generation. He is great."
1,Drunkin karaoke anyone?,"Holy crap, this guy SUCKS! All I want to know is how this dude pulls it off. I mean, he gets drunk out of his mind, babbles incomprehensible gibberish into the microphone, and PEOPLE PAY HIM TO LISTEN TO IT????!!!! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT???!!!! This guy is the biggest joke I have ever heard. ""Yeeeeeer baaaaaawdy issssssaa wuuuuunerlaaaaaand............."" PURE GARBAGE. Trust me folks, save your money. You need this album about as much as John needs another drink!!!!!"
1,so worthless,"wow, everyone is raving about John Mayers lyrics, its so funny because they are so shallow ... Pretty much just a regurgitation of everything else nowadays. It's reminiscent of the Backstreet Boys, with the only problem being that he actually takes himself seriously. Really, just read the Amazon review, it pretty much says everything."
1,Weak sauce,"Sorry ladies, being good lucking doesn't make John Mayer a musical genius. For true brilliance, listen to Tool, Meshuggah, or Radiohead."
1,BORING,"Wow, this is incredibly boring stuff. Dave Matthews-wanna be vocals is right. i can't wait for Peter Gabriel to come back so guys like this fade away. Also, do men listen to this stuff? i cannot imagine a man actually enjoying this. Ok, maybe some baseball cap wearing BU quasi-hippie jocks. Come on people, KICK OUT THE JAMS already."
3,"Great start, then it fizzles","The first half of this CD, played twice, would be better than the whole album once through. It fizzles in the 2nd half, with several tunes that just are not memorable. But it does start out great. Mr. Mayer is obviously talented, but his voice is kind of monotone. So after a while, you've heard enough of it. So press STOP about half way through, or three-quarters, & then put on something else. And then you'll really enjoy this Room for Squares. As for the follow-up Live album, with many of the same tunes: Stick with this studio version."
2,Color by numbers,"Genius would require more than transparent emulation and standard songwriting in my opinion.If you don't play music yourself or think that the ability to copy others or follow formulas has some value, then maybe this is for you.I am an advocate of judging how something sounds over where it fits in terms of creativity or obscurity. However, Mayer has crossed the line. Not only does he clearly seek to write songs just as he has heard and make his voice sound just as others, the voice he's chosen is that contrived dave matthewesque cacaphony.If you love coldplay and dave matthews and anything that sounds acoustic, then knock your socks off. But, if you've heard a couple Mayer songs and aren't into acoustic singer-songwriters enough to know a hack from a visionary, I would keep looking for an artist with at least the desire for creativity and unique personal expression."
2,Room For Squares.,John Mayer. Well This album is not very good one. His voice is annoying and perhaps sounds a bit too like Dave Matthews ( who I don't like either). He knows how to play a guitar and I give the album credit that it has good musicianship but the songwriting is terrible. I though that person that has these skills could write a decent tune but jeez. The melodies are okay but the rythm and the lyrics. Don't get me started on the lyrics. Most of the lyrics are so bland and shallow and especially the hit single your Body Is A Wonderland I mean could it be more corny than that. This man has obviously talent for playing but he needs to find wider range for his voice and try to write better songs. Sorry maybe next time.
1,People actually like this nonsense?,John Mayer is the patron saint of every guy who got laid in a dorm room due to playing the acoustic guitar badly.
1,It's amazing...,"Yes, that's right, amazing. It's amazing how I just can't stop writing mean things about John Mayer and his miserable, superficial excuse for music. It's amazing how I manage to hate him more with each successive single he releases. It's amazing how he manages to sing as if he was born with no testosterone whatsoever. It's amazing how many people out there seem to think anything with acoustic guitars and whiny vocals has ""substance."" It's amazing to see what kind of lyrics pass for ""meaningful"" these days. It's amazing that ""Your Body is a Wonderland"" doesn't induce fits of mass regurgitation whenever and wherever it's played. And most of all, it's amazing how my genre of choice, metal, gets bagged on as lowbrow by many of the same people who listen to this ridiculous drivel because the radio tells them to. Seriously, I don't know what hurts more after hearing John Mayer, my brain or my teeth."
1,Who the hell does this guy think he is anyways?,"""I just can't wait for my ten year reunion, I'm gonna bust out on the double doors, and when I stand on these tables before you, you'll know what all this time was for.""John, get down off that table, get off that pedestal you put yourself on. This guy has been to waaaay too many Tony Robins seminars. Your body is a wonderland? I'm pretty sure he wrote that one for himself."
1,Terrible trite crap,"Bought this one on the recommendation of a couple of friends. The comparisons used were intriguing: Dave Matthews, et. al. Popped the disc in, though, and was the most disappointed I have ever been with a cd. The music was cheesy and overorchestrated and the lyrics were even worse. It's like someone took the journal from that moody girl in the back of your high school English class and went to town with a thesaurus. Come on guys. If you can honestly tell me that ""I want to run through the halls of my high school/I want to scream at the top of my lungs"" is a good lyric (or even remotely similar to anything that deserves a record contract), I will die of shock. Oh, and stop with the Dave Matthews comparison. He sounds more like Michael Bolton on a bad day."
2,Background music,"I bought this CD on the strength of ""83,"" which is a marvelous song. Unfortunately, the other cuts don't live up to its promise. The overall sound is very appealing, but the lyrics don't really reward a close listen; in fact, they're whiny and repetitive.This would be fine played at low volume in a restaurant, but it's not very interesting to actually *listen* to."
2,Not for me!,I actually liked only about 2 songs on this CD....I gave it to someone that loves John Mayer and actuallylikes the fact you cannot understand a single lyric heis singing!!! LOL
3,John Mayer Cd Review,"The CD is good in general, I enjoyed only two songs out of the entire Disc. I recommend it if you like soft music slow paced."
5,New Era,"John is a gifted guitar player who is coming into his own as a songwriter. His songs touch universal points that everyone has gone through. He is willing to show is vunerability, and that takes courage. His live shows are even better...but in the words of JM "" they best of me is still hiding up my sleeve"". Look for a great follow-up to Room for Squares on Aware."
3,Don't be mislead by narrow-minded reviewer,"Yes, it's light. Yes, he's young. ...Back to Mayer. Given that he's only 23 (and I'm over a decade older), I see that he is trying to express opinions and insights that most his age wish they could begin to articulate. Most of the time he succeeds. But what's most entertaining about this CD is the music. Having seen Mayer in concert recently, I was amazed that he not only writes all his lyrics, but plays many of the instruments you will hear on the CD.It's good for a lazy, laid-back day when you don't want sugary-sweet, but aren't ready for something salty. He is a mellow choice well-executed. And as a Dave Matthews fan, I do see some similarity, but I don't discount him as a DM wannabe. John Mayer is on his way, buy this CD and begin to watch him grow."
4,This guy is in a class by himself,"If I can put it in a nutshell, this guy is unique. He is just being himself and not what the industry wants him to be. This is the quality I like about him...""No Such Thing"" caught me early one Saturday morning when I fell asleep in front of VH1. The melody and the chorus is what really stirred me. His guitar licks get you going in gear. Imagine that waking you up on Saturday morning...""Room for Squares"" will be a classic..."
3,Square,"For all that I love his smokey voice and smooth lyrics, this music is VERY 3 stars. It's very NICE, you can't really hate it but there is a certain quality missing, an element of originality or a spark of creativity that could have brought this album so much higher. It is, after all, pop and so not meant to be challenging. One reviewer said ""clean your house to this"" and gave 5 stars. Background music to me will never get 5 but sometimes it is exactly what you want."
4,John Mayer is a good artist,"I own this CD and personally I like it better than Heavier Things. His three best songs ""No Such Thing"", ""Why Georgia"" and ""Your Body is a Wonderland"" are all my favorite. I wanted this CD because I heard Your Body is a Wonderland on the radio a million times and No Such Thing and I liked it. I'd give this CD 4.5 stars. John Mayer is one of my favorite artists. And the songs are really good. But it's just my opinion."
4,THere's Always Room for Squares,"This debut by John is a sheer knockout, enjoyable by both twentysomething females looking for love (good, real, sincere love) and twentysomething males that similarly emulate John's awkwardness in finding such love. While love is not big on my agenda currently, John has a very sincere way of conveying relationship situations... obviously credited to his superb lyricism. Track 3 ""My Stupid Mouth"" for instance, vividly captures the discomfort of a ""slip of the mouth"" on an already tense, figgedity first date. John not only delivers situational dialogue, but also paints a fabulous description of body mannerisms, nervous behavior, and emotion. You can't help but say ""Damn, I've been through a situation just like that!"" Not all his songs are about relationships though, tracks like ""'83"" and ""3x5"" show the true observer in John, respectively discussing the simplicity of childhood and how memories are so much bigger than any camera or 3x5 could ever capture."
5,i'm interested in music again...,"Before John Mayer burst onto the music scene, I was REALLY bored with what I was hearing on mainstream radio. ""Yeah, yeah"" and various ways of saying ""baby, i love you"" just don't cut it for me. I love John's ""smart"" lyrics and his rich voice. I've almost had to stop listening to this CD in the car just because I get so into what he's saying, I forget to pay attention...But anyway, he's at the top of my list and I reccomend him to anyone!"
4,A Dave Matthews voice?,"I will be short. A young guy who writes his own music, plays the guitar soulfully and has the voice of an (I admit hoarse) angel, deserves nothing but respect. I'm happy to hear some real, ment music with all it's shortcomings and cliche's. I will wait for more and am sure that he will deliver. And all of you who are talking about Dave Matthews: I can't hear any resemblence in their voices."
5,CAN'T GET THIS CD OUT OF MY PLAYER!!!,"BEST CD I have heard in a while! I am addicted to this music! Easy listening lyrics that bring you back to when music was fun to listen too. I think he has more of a Bruce Hornsby/Go West tone to him, If you can imagine that? I just like him...period the end... I heard he is an amazing guitarist live..."
4,Worth a listen or five...,"I'm not sure what the agenda is for those who are bashing this ""brat"" on this site but the short and long of it is that this album offers up easy-going, relaxed mood music that has some nice introspective, hook-laden pop. This album doesn't reinvent the wheel but the lyricism isn't bad and the music varies from easy-going acoustic 7Up bounce-pop to Lite FM jazzy-pop. Not sugary-sweet but not much edge...and while the album doesn't hit you hard in the face or assault your ears, it's definitely better than other stuff out there. And I'm not sure what reaction James Taylor's debut album garnered, but I know that critics (and many people at the time) panned Led Zeppelin. If it's good music it will last. Not sure if ""Room For Squares"" is worth a Grammy, but it's definitely worth a listen."
3,Grows on you,"Initially, all of the songs sounded the same; however, they began to grow on me after a couple more times through the CD. It took me a while to hear the more subtle elements of John Mayer's chord progressions and arrangements. His tasteful guitar work and smoky voice are carefully woven into each song to great effect. The lyrics unfortunately border on trite sometimes, but they provide some hope for improvement in his next release.In the end, Room For Squares showcases Mayer's unique sound in a clean, breezy pop album that isn't meant to change the world.Songs to check out: Neon, Great Indoors, No Such Thing."
3,Room For Improvement...,"But dont get me wrong, there are a good five tracks on this cd! Its just that once you get past the cute similarity between John and Dave Matthews, ummm, you kinda get bored.The highlights on the album are: Great Indoors and Your Body is a Wonderland which are both sexy and seductive.Back To You is my personal favorite, the tried and true topic of an undying love although the song ends with a self empowering twist.Not every album you buy is meant to change your perspective on the world, nor must it move you to tears. Some albums are simply ok for what their worth. This is one of them."
5,Aren't we all critics??? lol,"I am not a teeny bopper nor am I an old kodger, and I love John Mayer. I agree completely with a previous review, that it is about time we get a cd from an artist who is truly an artist. One who writes and plays his own music and his own lyrics. I have found myself listening over and over to this cd, especially when I am on the treadmill at the gym :) Being a single in this crazy world, I find myself relating to all of these songs in a deep way. Dig below your superficiality and you too, may be touched by this man's incredible heartfelt talent."
4,Addicted...,"I'm hopelessly addicted to this CD. I purchased it on a whim. I had heard ""No Such Thing"" a few times while at the gym and liked it. I had also read a few reviews and was interested in hearing more of JM. I got it in the mail a few days ago and I just can't stop listening to it.Although at times JM reminds me of Dave Matthews Band, Genesis and bits of other artists, that in no way takes away from this stellar CD. The songwriting is great. The musicianship is superb. And the lyrics, although seemingly shallow at first listen, are deeper than their first impression.I highly recommend this album!"
5,Very nice!,"this cd is very well-done. i fell in love with john mayer a few months ago, and since then, i've saw him live twice. his lyrics make you feel like he is speaking to you on such a personal level. beautiful songs. get this cd, just because it's totally worth it."
3,Hmmm...,"Ok, I'm really not into the whole popstar ideal thing, but when I heard John's singles on the radio, I took a step back and stared. He really is in a category all by himself. While sometimes the sugar-coated lyrics he drools out to females (like me) can get a little old and a little too sweet for my tastebuds, he's not the walking definition of the genre we so blatantly call pop. His maturity is expressed when he's not belting out tunes (with a monstrous smooth voice) about a girl he's head over heels with. My Stupid Mouth is probably one of my favorites mostly because it expresses awkward social behavior. My absolute favorite is St. Patrick's Day because it's romantic while being sarcastic about how our years are planned around the holidays and their meanings. While not a must for every record collection, a good album with a lot of soul."
3,good but forgetable,"John Mayer writes some good songs, and the music is also very well done. I can get into almost every song on this cd, as I rarely find the need to press faast forward when I pop it in. However, this cd just doesn't have the sticking power like a Dave Matthews or a Jack Johnson, his songs are well wrote, but seem bubble gummy at times, and about nothing of any substance. Overall a decent debut album."
4,Loved this CD,"I have been playing this cd over and over in my car ever since I bought it, and am still not tired of hearing it. Love it."
4,Fantabulous,"Many people criticise John Mayer's music as being simple, but that is what makes it so great. The simplicity and honesty of the words and his warm voice make this a great cd to buy. No thinking required, just blunt, straightforward lyrics to relax with after a hectic day."
4,Fantabulous,"Although many would criticise John Mayer's sound as being simple, that is what makes it so wonderful. The simplicity of the music and the honesty are what allow you to just lay back and absorb the warmth of his voice as the lyrics flow with the acoustics. No thinking required, just blunt, straight forward lyrics to relax with after a hectic day."
5,Fantastic new talent,John Mayer's new album is fantastic! We have been unable to take the cd out of our car cd player since getting it.He is a great guitarist and song writer who is destined for bigger things.Tom
5,The John Mayer's best CD,"I've purchased several of John's CDs and this is without a doubt the very best. I wanted to hear someone that sounded more like the American's I knew in the 60s and 70s: nonconformists, independent minded and imaginatively descriptive. My favorite songs are Neon and Great Indoors which both describe people I knew and loved.Take away these songs and the rest of the album is incredible. I don't have to say he's an incredible artist (that's a given)... it's just the entire scene couldn't be contrived... I think it's what he really saw. Just super happening... man!!!!"
3,"Not bad, not great","I like enough of John Mayer to purchase this CD new - unusual for me, because I'm cheap and tired of getting really crappy music for my money.While Room for Squares is not terrible, it's not great, either. The songs from the radio are the best, of course, but some of the other songs sound exactly like, well, other songs on the CD. The lyrics might be different, but the sound is same.This is a great CD for relaxing or if you want something under conversation when you have people over, but it does get a bit annoying after a while. Put it on shuffle with a good variety and you'll be OK."
5,"If you love Mayer, check out Steven Delopoulos!","Right now, the current genre leaders are John Mayer and Steven Delopoulos. RFS is fantastic. John's singing and guitar playing abilities are excellent, and this is a great CD to kick back to and relax. Another fave artist of mine is a New Jersey singer/songwriter named Steven Delopoulos. I caught him live in Cleveland recently, and he down flat BLEW ME AWAY!!! His way underrated CD titled 'ME DIED BLUE' is a veritable acoustic rock/folk MASTERPIECE, with some tight backup musicians as well. If you love Mayer, you MUST check out Steven Delopoulos. His website is at www.stevendelopoulos.com"
4,Powerful Songwriter on his way to bigger things,"I'm really amazed to find so many bad reviews for John Mayer here. He's young, which means that this album is full of freshness, and he's only going to get better!Some of the songs seem not fully thought out, but his Stevie Ray Vaughn-esque guitar is really good, and he has a really nice voice. ""3 x 5"" is a truly beautiful, mature song. I look forward to hearing more form him!"
3,"Original, but Boring.","I know that since 75% of the people who will buy this CD are melodramatic teenage girls, and that calling a CD boring may be unheard of to them--but even his first hit single was quickly played-out, and the rest of this CD is no exception. He has quite an original sound, for at least music of late, and his voice isn't too bad; it's just that the songs are redundant, all sounding pretty much the same. I know we all wish Mayer would make more listenable music with his style, but this CD could have been a lot better, it comes off reminding me of Eagle Eye Cherry. He had one of the most played out songs of '98 and is probably one of the biggest one-hit-wonders of the past 5 years, what did the poor souls who bought his CD expect but bland filler--same goes with Mayer. Skip this CD, if you're in to this type of music check out David Gray and British artists such as him, they all have a pretty similar bland boring sound, you'll be blown away."
5,Room For Squares... and everyone else,Let me just say that I almost didn't buy this CD because of the negative 'Editorial Review' on Amazon.com.John Mayer is a breath of fresh air. A break-out artist. I bought this CD despite the (negative) review printed here and was greatly surprised by its ability to awaken familiar feelings in my soul. One can really relate to the lyrics.This is one of those CDs that you play from beginning to end and then play it all over again. Almost every track is a winner. 'My Stupid Mouth' hit me right where I live as well as 'Love Song For No One'. Each track seems to have a well thought out story behind it.GOOD WORK John Mayer! This is a fantastic group of songs.
5,Excellent!,"John Mayer is one of the best Acustic Folk-Rockers out there right now. It has a beat to it that is mellow but great. Perfect for chilling or if you're just in a bad mood. If you like this, I reccomend Peter Stuart (and his band Dog's Eye View) or Rockwell Church."
5,Room for John Mayer,"I was at a concert recently and guess who was the opening act. Well duh, it was John Mayer. I bought his CD at the show. He is absolutely amazing. His CD is outstanding, and his live show was enthralling. He was so involved with his music. ""No Such Thing"" has potential to be a radio hit as does ""Your Body is a Wonderland."" The latter is one of the sweetest songs, and is reminiscent of Dave Matthew's Band's ""Crash."" Every song is awesome, and I would highly recomend this album to anyone."
5,Awesome singer/songwriter,"I think this CD is just great. At first, I didn't really pay attention to John Mayer, but after listening to the CD, I fell in love with it. I don't think he tries to be like Dave Matthews at all. He's genuine, in my perspective. The fact that he writes his own songs just adds to that. His voice is so calming and smooth, and his words are unique."
5,... WONDERFUL CD!,"... Mayer is in a class by himself and I don't find him to be copying anyone. This is unique stuff, guys. I think it's obvious to most of us out there! Beautiful soulful dripping voice, great guitar and smart lyrics coming from this very young artist. Yes, he's in that general folky area of the wonderful David Grey (buy White Ladder!), DMB and Jeff Buckley, but Mayer is in his own unique space. ""Not myself"" is my favourite... buy this cd and I don't think you will be disappointed!"
4,Folk with some kick and pop with some brains,"Say, do you like great songwriting, but too often find it packaged in artsy, coffee-house pretense? Well, I do. I love a well written song, but often find the sparse production of ""singer-songwriters"" to be, well, boring. John Mayer writes great songs, personal songs. He sings them with great passion. He also has the pop sense to record with a full band that adds to their accessibility. The combination results in the intimacy and quality of the singer-songwriter genre with the excitement of pop songs. ""Love Song For No One"" could be a hit on pop radio, college radio, or anywhere else for that matter. ""Room For Squares"" is an album simply packed with great songs. Mid-tempo, intelligent pop/rock/folk for people who like their folk with some kick and their pop with some brains. Mayer is a talent worth checking out."
5,PEOPLE.... You MUST hear this!,"Where did this guy come from? What an incredible voice. What incredible songwriting. What incredible guitar playing! In my opinion, each and every song is a true 'keeper'. They all are different. Not like on some freshman efforts when you get tired of the CD half the way through becauseit seems as if you have heard the same song over and over... and over again! John Mayer's voive sounds a little like Michael Frank's. It sounds a little like Willy Porter. It sounds a lot like John Mayer. People need to hear this. I just can't say that enough. I am lending it to everyone I know but the word needs to be spread. GREAT work, John. Can't wait for your next one!"
3,Mediocre.,"I was expecting a lot more from this. I don't know why. I guess I'm just used to listening to David Gray, who in my opinion, is a better songwriter than John Mayer.Don't get me wrong, this CD isn't a bad buy. But don't pay more than [price range] U.S. for it... it's not worth it. Don't expect Bob Dylan or David Gray or anything. Some of the songs are catchy, some aren't. The lyrics are nothing extremely special. I give it three stars because it seems as if he writes these songs from his heart, but nothing more because it also seems as if it's completely over-produced... it doesn't display John's raw talent like I thought it would."
2,Better off buying Dave Mathews Band *gasp*,"Yes, good guitar playing, decent lyrics... but what this boils down to is a poor version of the Dave Matthews Band. I'm not a huge Dave Matthews fan, but I can spot a band-wagon rider when I see one and John Mayer is one of them. I recently saw him play in New England and he just didn't par up. The crowd was aching for the opening act to come back on...."
2,This CD is Trite,"I haven't heard a CD this boring or uneventful in so long. If I wanted to listen to Dave Matthews, I'd listen to Dave Matthews, if I wanted to hear a singer/songwriter who can actually play guitar I'd listen to Ryan Adams. The fact of the matter is, is that this cd just isn't very good. I'm not quite sure how you build a huge following on insipid tunes such as these. When I saw John Mayer in Memphis, I honestly thought he had bowel problems. His facial expressions are utterly mystifying. When the power went off on the stage he was playing, due to technical difficulties, perhaps John should have taken it as a sign and left."
1,"BORING, SELF ABSORBED And AIMLESS","I bought this Cd when it was at its ""introductory $6.99 new artist"" price(ironically, it was his SECOND cd album!) - where it remained for several months till it was elevated to $12.99...DUNNO WHY...he's NOT the new ""JAMES TAYLOR"" as has been implied - JAMES TAYLOR is still kicking ass as a recording artist(thirty some odd years later!) and no one else can ever top him in his genre...JOHN, enjoy your fame while it lasts! Your Grammy was awarded only because you topped the heap of boring, indifferent and aimless artists the season this Cd was issued. You'll be history soon...your music is SO BLAND. JAMES TAYLOR won a GRAMMY too, and he's the REAL ORIGINAL!"
2,I KNOW ELTON JOHN LIKES HIM BUT:,"HIS VOICE IS SMOOTH BUT EVERY SONG SOUNDED THE SAME, IT WAS PRETTY BORING.....MAYBE HE'S BETTER IN CONCERT?"
1,Acoustic wannabe rubbish.,"This guy sucks. His music sucks, his stage presence sucks, his lyrics suck, his voice sucks, his playing style sucks, his chord progressions suck, John Mayer sucks.[b]This aint nothing but disposable frat boy music. I hate the fact people look up to John Mayer as a blues guitarist. LOL. Blues? He makes my face blue is as close as he gets! This album was nothing more than a chick flick attempt. Sorry John Mayer.....your music sucks![/b]Highlight: Plays perfect in a gay bar."
1,"John Mayer - the Cure for Insomnia, AND LIFE","John mayer is best known for his work in the famous ""Famous Ray's All American Rock and/or Roll.""However, his solo career isn't nearly as good. Just listen to one of his songs. He plays so slow and low that any rightthinking music fan must hate it. Hes like Dave Matthew's and Hootie and the Blowfish's evil love child. He must be stopped. If you like this though, i highly recommend the Cash Money Millionaire's ""Thug Money Gs"" and PPP Death Squad's ""Death's Head."""
5,This guy can't be only 15!,"John Mayer is anything but square! How can someone so young have such a strong voice and write such moving lyrics! I heard him at the Grammy's and was moved. I bought the CD and I am in awe of the whole collection. He definitely deserved the Best Newcomer Award! At his age, we have many many years of great music to come but make sure you get in at square one with this CD."
3,"I watch ""Smallville.""","I bought this CD because ""No Such Thing,"" heard on ""Smallville,"" is a very catchy tune. The rest of the CD is just like that...smooth, catchy, totally unoffensive. During the second listen, I realized what it sounds like: Michael Franks. It's Michael Franks for those born after 1980.Maybe not as jazz influenced, and definitly not as interesting lyrically (although Franks has way too many songs telling us what love is) but satisfying, nonetheless. A nice CD your mom won't mind listening to when you're in the car together."
3,I'm cutting this guy some slack,"Well, I'd like to bash this album, but I can't ignore decent guitar playing. At least he can play his instrument. What ever happened to singing? His voice is .. well.. not that good. Sounds like a DMB wanna-be. And his song writing - well.. it's not good either - there is no deep meaning to it. This album is made for teenagers who think they like to listen to adult music. This music is easy to write, and seems more like an advertisement than a music record. John Mayer made a record for the wallet and not something from his heart."
5,My Favorite new singer-songwriter,"At first listen, you may think that John Mayer's album,""Room For Squares"", is just another pop record by just some guy that just wants to make money. But if you really take a listen, you will discover that he is one of the greatest new singer-songwriters around now, and that he is well mentally beyond his years. I HIGHLY!!! recommend this album to ANY real music fan."
5,"Pleasant, Youthful Pop rock","When I first read of this artist in the Media Play magazine REPLAY they said that he would at first sound like Dave Matthews voice mixed with David Gray's music. I would say that after listening to his Cd, that's not entirely accurate. He doesn't really sound like Dave because it's far smoother. Dave has a grittier quality. I also believe that it sounds more influenced by the vocal stylings of Stevie Ray Vaughn. Albeit a Stevie Ray Vaughn singing jazzy pop rock tunes. Mayer's music sounds more like Dave Matthews in the sense that it has a jazzy sound to it, but it doesn't retain their free jam feel. Mayer isn't a genius, or cutting edge, but he has made a very consistently melodic and expressive album that mixes his influences just right. Blues, jazz, rock all equate into the mix for a mellow album. Also of note is his song of anguish ""My Stupid Mouth."" The title says it all."
3,Nostalgic tunes,"Only when listening to the track "" Body is A wonderland"" over the MTV, did I go out to search for his album, rather unknown in this part of the country. Does have a youngish voice."
5,NO cd changer should be set on random until this is in there,"I bought this album(yes, I bought the LP, not the CD, they do make a domestic vinyl of this)because I liked No Such Thing.I knew going in that it would have a lot of acoustic stuff, but I was expecting real folky slow stuff along the lines of Sarah Mclachlan. I was real surprised to hear stuff like Neon, where he really shows what an accomplished guitarist he is. The best song is The Great Indoors-I can't stop playing it-reminds me of In A Daydream by the Freddie Jones Band. This is roots rock with a tad of alternative mixed in.Buy the LP (not CD), enjoy the acoustics analog style on some 3 way Polk speakers, and you will hear the way this album was intended to be heard-free from DIGITAL.But DO record it to your hard drive to have a cd for the car.No Cd Changer should be on random setting without this."
5,An Amazing CD,"John Mayer was the sole reason why I starting listening to folk, and rock, and soft rock... his songs are amazing, very good beats, and very good lyrics. He is very heartfelt with his music, and he does a good job presenting it. I listen to his CD everyday over and over again. Don't be fooled by his singles that came out, there are other songs on the CD that are amazing, and are very good!! I wopuld definetly buy the CD even if you dont like folk/rock/whatever.... because i know people who like rap and bought this CD.... it's one for everyone, the whole family to enjoy! It's amazing! You won't regret it!"
1,Arrested Development,"John Mayer's major label debut, Room for Squares, has occasioned more than one comparison to Dave Matthews. One spin and it's easy to hear why. His vocal ID is two-thirds Matthews, one-third Peter Gabriel, with his musical bearing Dave Matthews Band-lite. Beyond the comparisons, Room for Squares is a breezy listen, no more or less. Each mild pleasure, like the slinky ""City Love"", is negated by a bland arrangement; the acoustic skiffle of ""83"" is belabored by its rose-colored nostalgia for when he was all of five. This is a major case of arrested development - what more can you expect from someone who insists that ""the real world is just a lie you rise above""? Most real: ""Your Body Is a Wonderland"", wherein Mayer discovers sex, and it means more to him (and us) than that Superman lunch box he pines for from 1983."
4,it is like new but.......,it took a long time for me to receive it which was a real bummer. the CD itself was in great shape and exactly as described by the seller. maybe they had a busy week?
4,well worth the money,"I bought this CD for the song ""Your Body is a Wonderland"" and found the rest of the songs to be just as good. John Mayer covers the gammet with slow, soulful melodies, as well as kicking it up a little with other songs. If you're preference in song voice is quiet and strong, this CD might work for you."
1,Ugh.,"This guy sounds as if he's never learned how to enunciate ANYTHING. He swallows vowels, consonants, and any life that might be in his ""music"". He's definitely not brilliant, nor do I understand how people could possibly listen to the entire CD, much less appreciate it.There is some promise in his guitar playing, if only he'd keep his mouth shut while he was doing it, we'd all be better off.Save your money for something a little more moving. You'll thank me for it."
2,Disappointing,"I was really hyped to get this CD, I've always loved John Mayer and Room For Squares is one of my all time favorite CDs. His voice is fabulous. But, when my boyfriend finally bought it for me, it was only mediocre. Room For Squares had an even number of slow songs and HAPPY upbeat songs. Heavier Things just seems like kind of a slow drawn out disc. Bigger Than My Body is wonderful, but I wasn't really able to get into the other songs. They were just really slow."
1,Music for mouthbreathers!!!!!!,"I borrowed this cd from someone who actually bought this.....and this person was actually an adult! I can't understand what anybody sees in this kid, but they must see something as this has sold a couple million copies. This muzak is so bland and soul less.....that it's almost unbelievable. It's never good when a music academy brat attempts to bare his soul.....under the guise of singer/songwriter. There is nothing distinctive here......except the parts when he sounds autistic. The guitar playing, topics and lyrics are so generic......when listening it seems you are stuck inside of a advertisement for the Gap or Abercrombie and Fitch. I don't recommend this cd to anybody over the age of 15..."
1,What's the big deal with this guy?,"When he sings, it sounds like he has a large bathtowel crammed in his throat. It doesn't even sound like singing. Maybe he should just stick to his songwriting (which I'm not very impressed with anyway) and let someone with an actual voice perform it for him."
1,"Ships in 24 hours, drips for an hour","Wow, I didn't realize anything this mediocre could get produced by a major label. Obviously good intentions, but there are no surprises anywhere in instrumentation, tonal changes, energy, or pace. My strong bias is not to write negative reviews, but this sounds like music and lyrics for a very young person locked in a fetal position in their dorm bed, reminiscing about a life that has hardly begun."
1,terrible,"If you have any prior sense of music, play any instrument or are in any means influenced by the works of musicians who write and sing music based on soul and hardship, heartbreak and life, and not about sissy highschool relationships than this is definetly not the album for you. To musicians, his craftmanship and prue subject matter in his songs, i.e. your body is a wonderland, is awful, and awe astounding, but being that the music industry is in it for the quick buck it is no wonder such a pop teen orientated artist is such a hint. Ive fallen for such *** before but ive graduated highschool and i feel that my music should move along with me, but it seems johns hasnt."
3,"No such thing, peeps!","John Mayer is a huge Dave Matthews-wannabe, and it's obvious in his voice and music prefs. Overrated, though I do enjoy ""No Such Thing."""
1,boring [stuff],"I used to own this cd (for roughly 2 days). now my copy is sleeping with the fishes. This guy just goes on and on about his ""issues"" the whole album, and never caught my attention. infact, he comes across as condescending pretty much the whole time. i guess John Mayer is smarter than all of us. i guarantee this stud won't even be remembered 2 years from now. my sister recommended this cd to me, because i like matthews band. but she should have just told me that he's just a dave matthews cover act and saved me the time and money."
2,What's the big deal?,"Over the past month or so, I've been hearing myriads of people raving about how great this CD is. Having finally bought it, without hearing any of it before I did, I have to say that I don't see what's so spectacular about it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that it's a bad album at all. All I'm saying is that this is not anything to get that excited about. I liked most of it, but there was nothing that blew me away. What I heard was standard lite-pop/rock. The lyrics are nothing outstanding. The guitar playing is good, but nothing special. The backing band is actually really banal and boring. I guess after hearing so many people rave about this album I was expecting something groundbreaking. Instead, what I hear is almost mediocre, and definetly not impressive. There's promise here, but no delivery."
4,Young Star Suprises Music World,"John Mayer does a awesome job on his first released album into the music world. I first heard the music through a reccomendation of this website, telling me to check out his stuff if I liked Dave Matthews. It was a suprise to me when I heard his stuff. It is a great mix of mellow music with a bit of upbeat songs. A personal favorite is Love Song For No One and his more popular No Such Thing. Both convey great music, he is a rising star that will be selling out larger venues in the near future. See him live while you can in the smaller venues, he will be wider known in no time."
4,Not cool enough for critics. Great if you like solid music.,"This record will probably be another instance in which super-cool critics dog it, but the regular folk (a.k.a. record buyers) will really like it. Catchy pop tunes with great hooks, and really nice (yet subtle) guitar work from a really talented guy. I bought this CD based after reading a magazine article, and now at least a dozen friends are hooked on it. So if your a super-slick critic, you may want to pass and stick with Radiohead, but if you just want a solid record with good tunes, pick this up."
2,Not much beyond the singles,"The two songs you hear from this set on the radio are pleasant slices of pop. IT is too bad then to discover that the rest of the album lacks the creative spark, melodies and energy that the 2 singles do.Wait for the best of is my advice."
2,Overrated,"You'll like this CD if you are a young woman or girlthat wishes that men would stop behaving like men andbe more sensitive. Or if you don't listen to music thatsnot played on your favorite top 40 station. Or if you area gay man.Otherwise, its just not worth it. Slow, boring, musically uninteresting with silly lyrics that make a grown man wantto gag.But I don't like Dave Matthews either, so don't be surprisedthat I don't like John Mayer"
5,absolutely amazing,"this cd is absolutely amazing, make sure you give it more than one chance; that amazon reviewer probably wishes he could do a rewrite.... my friend played me a couple of his songs when the name john mayer hadn't even been mentioned on mtv, and i wasn't impressed. on a later listening, i went right out and bought the cd and it didn't leave my cd changer for 2 months. i promise if youre someone who has a greater appreciation for music than britney or nsync, and around the ages of 15 to 30, you'll fall in love w/ john like i did."
5,One of the best albums ever,John Mayer is one of the greatest singer/songwriters of our time. Many artists on the music scene today do not sing songs that paint a picture of the life of the artist. John however writes music and lyrics that paint a beautiful picture that is clear for everyone to see. He sings about the events and experiences that happen in a person's life. ...
3,WHat time is this?,I give John Mayer the title Rockin' Perry (Como) just because some of this seems to be ahead of the times and some is right on.I rated this not listenining to No Such Thing and Wonderland because I've heard it a million times. What I really Like is St. Patrick's Day because of the reference to Christmas. Buy this because I guarantee you will enjoy it and play it again-and-again for his words and and style. Don't have the volumn set high on the 1st song---the first words might crackle in your boxes. 31/2 stars---A nice first effort.
4,Good CD,"I like this CD it is good. I think the editor's review was a little biased, he needs to lighten up."
3,Was hoping,"I love this guy, he has a great sense of humor in his music, and a great guitar player, but I wasn't thrilled with this album. I finished this cd being disappointed. But he has the potential to please the masses in his future works."
2,some good stuff,there's a few good tracks mostly kind of wimpy even the good ones wear thin really quickly. comparisons to Dave Matthews I find insane. there is nowhere near the fire and musical talent of Dave in John Mayer.
5,one of most talented singer-songwriters ever,"i've been listening first to his acoustic renditions (downloaded) and to room for squares since a year ago march when my daughter saw him live in tuscon. i saw him recently in california. he is a major superstar in the making...in the same songwriting league as joni mitchell, james taylor and paul simon. his guitar work is beautiful. each of his songs is as unique as were the beatles',. his lyrics are truly touching, and his voice evokes deeply felt emotions. john mayor is in a league of his own. however, i agree with another reviewer that his acoustic renditions are more beautiful. he is one artist who sounds better accompanied by only a bass guitar than backed by a band."
3,On Point - Live is still better,"As a blues and Jazz artist myself - he definetly has a rich songwrting and singing talent. Shades of the classics come through in his LIVE shows. (of which you can listen to streaming samples on the web) However this 'manufatured' CD is missing some of the richness of his live performance. Thankfully, John Mayer is rooted in the old 'sharing-is-caring' school of music.It has the essence of what he can really deliver, but what it is missing is the real honest delivery that he can wallop you with when he's up on stage. - oh well. Not necessarily a must have CD, but it is definetly something that you should consider adding to your listening rep. It's worth the time"
5,Amazon Needs a New Review Writer,"...This is the best new album I have. The songs on the album are great. John is one of the few artists out there who was any real talent anymore. The song's have a great tone to them. The melodies get stuck in my head all day. You can't go wrong with it. With the Britney Spears and N'Syncs of today, people don't appreciate good music when they hear it. I hope Ricky doesn't do this for a living, he may want to get a new job."
2,Critics are right,"This album is perfect for dreaming females ages 13 to 19. Okay, so there are some catchy tunes (and by catchy tunes I mean simplistic, repeating, 3 chord wonders), but any avid music fan can tell you exactly from which artists Mayer gets his stuff from. I bet if I try real hard, I, too, can sound like Dave!Summary: If your biggest worry in life is how to catch the eye of the guy you pine after in history class, buy it. If not, be true and go get some Radiohead."
3,"Empty Lyrics, Fantastic Music",John Mayer's cd is rather base. The lyrics are undaunting and ordinary. Sometimes they are downright corny. Nevertheless I appreciate his music writing skills and his voice is unique. Buy it for your car - - where you're too distracted by other things to pay attention to the words.
1,Boring.....,"I will say that John Mayer is an accomplished guitar player. I think he has the potential to be a good song writer. However, he just didn't show it on this album. I listened to every song on the album and was, well, bored. Nothing stood out, nothing really made me think, ""Wow, that was a good song."" Nothing stuck in my head and I had no desire to listen to the disk again. You know how occasionally you listen to an album and it influences your life or it makes you think? This never came close for me. Sorry John."
4,Ear Candy That's Good For You,"There's not a lot to dislike about John Mayer's ""Room For Squares."" The disc is consistently pleasurable throughout -- and there's nothing wrong with that!""Your Body Is A Wonderland"" comes as close to blissful pop perfection as any song I've heard in a long, long time."
4,Powerful Devastation,"Beautifully illustrated with color photos, this book vividly describes various catastrophic events that have occurred and continue to happen throughout the world. The events showing nature's often-horrific power include hurricanes, floods, volcanoes, fire, etc. Also discusses plagues, including AIDS, the Black Plague, as well as other diseases. Provides an international perspective on these events and discusses their causes, in addition to documenting their history and geographic areas where they occur. Includes a gazetteer pinpointing geographic locations of disaster areas.

Ages middle school and up."
4,Retro Bank still works with kids,Great for getting kids to work towards a goal and actually save their money in a piggy bank.
1,Broken in more than one way,We purchased one for our toddler's birthday. Within 2 dollars worth of putting in quarters the cents indicator fell off so all we see are the dollars. This wouldn't be a problem except the damn thing only opens if you have an exact multiple of ten dollars (and zero cents) in there.Shame on me for buying it more than 30 days before her birthday or this thing would be going back as defective.
5,Driving a Ferrari after a Civic...,"I had many concerns before buying this phones. I tried many headphones and currently was using Bose IE. I had many problems fitting them in my ear and the sound was below par to me even if I press the phones into my ear using my hands. I started researching. I was going to buy this or the $500 Shure E500 pth. Then I said myself, why not give it a try before investing a fortune in a phones (shure one) and I can tell after using this UE 5 for a few hours with my ipod, they are far beyond better than my expectations. Superb sound quality and brain damaging BASS. I can never turn up the volume on my ipod more than half way. You gotta listen to believe. If you are looking for an earbud fur your IPOD or MP3 player (if you are not gonna listen lossless music), I can definitely say this is the real thing."
2,Is it possible to have too much bass?,"In one word: Yes. It is possible to have too much bass.I previously owned a pair of Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10s. They were the best sounding earphones I've ever owned (although the fit could use some improvement).I bought the Super.fi 5 Extended Bass because of all the good reviews. And as a lot of other reviewers have stated, the bass is amazing on these earphones. It's loud and punchy.Unfortunately, man cannot live on bass alone. The mids and the highs lack punch and presence. I listen to a lot of ""bass heavy"" music like techno, hip hop, electro, dubstep, etc. I like a lot of bass. But it shouldn't come at the expense of other frequencies.If you are looking for earphones with solid bass but better response across all frequencies, I would recommend the Ultimate Ears TripleFi 10s over the Super.fi 5 EBs. Still really good bass, but also good mids and highs as well."
2,"Unfortunately, Not Durable","My second pair in 18 months has failed the same way: the wires near the jack get weakened from bending (I guess) and 1 channel goes away unless you keep the rubber boot bent with your fingers. Very frustrating in an expensive and otherwise excellent product. If you buy, be extremely gentle with them. Not recommended for wear during workouts."
5,greattttttt bassssssss,if you need bass in your life then these phones are for you greatttt sounding bass excellent product
4,Good sound and quality,"After having used these earphones for about 15 days I can say that I'm very pleased with it's sound.Although I found them initially uncomfortable now I changed my mind.They have a very good bass response. I use them with an Ipod nano and the sound is very good, but they lack the high frequencies, so I had to set the Ipod equalizer in ""amplify trebble"" position. With this setting the bass is very good and the trebble is also good. The isolation is not complete but if you put the volume high you will not hear anything outside.I put a four star because of the lack of trebble, compared to other earphones I have like Sony or Senheiser. I suppose that the top models have a better response, but they cost a lot of more money.I found that the cable doesn't have a good design because it has to be in front: I prefer the left cable shorter than the right earphone cable so you can put it behind your neck as with Sony models.Resuming I'd buy again these earphones because I'm very satisfied."
2,these sound like muddy water,"returned them because they sound like a $10 speaker trying to distort all songs in the muddy range. I have a friend with 5si pro's I'm going to try and I will report back.I've tried every shure, etymotic, Clip-on/earbud Hybrid Headphones, and liked all of them at their respective price points. I thought these would be a cheaper version of the more expensive 5's; but no.Also, I tried everything from rap to Dire Straights, they all sounded muddy."
4,"AWESOME BASS, BUT......","great IEM'S,THE BASS IS REALLY THUMPING AND THEY PROVIDE REASONABLE NOISE ISOLATION.THE ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE ,IS THAT WHEN YOU COMPARE THEM TO OTHER IEM'S, IT BECOMES APPARENT THAT THE BASS IS MAYBE TOO EXAGERATED.I ALSO HAVE THE SUPER FI.5 PRO AND ETYOMIC ER-6I.SWITCHING BETWEEN THE THREE REVEALS HOW FORCEFUL THE BASS REALLY IS AND HOW UNNATURAL IT SOUNDS AS A WHOLE.I STILL GIVE IT 4 STARS BECAUSE I ASSUME MOST BASSHEADS DONT CARE MUCH ABOUT HOW BALANCED THEY ARE, AND WILL LOVE THE BOOSTED BASS.I STILL LIKE THEM AND WOULD RECOMEND THEM IF YOU DONT MIND YOUR BASS ON THE HEAVY SIDE."
2,Overkill and over priced,"The picture is deceptive; these are HUGE for earbuds! I found these to be uncomfortable on long flights and the base it way to strong. I am use to having to turn the base up on most earphone but had to actually turn it way down to get anything that approached normal. Even ""flat"" was way to base. Given the price, I'm not very happy with this purchase."
4,Not what I ordered,"Similac Sensitive Soy formula really is the best. We tried many things and within 48 hours of giving this to my son it worked wonders. However!!! Amazon shows a picture of Similac Sensitive Soy Isomil........I ordered 3 cases without reading the fine print. They ship Similac Soy Isomil, it is not the sensitive......but that is what the picture is of. Becareful, read what it is they are selling. My son spits up much more with the Isomil, non sensitive, but with 3 cases.....we are dealing."
2,Birth of Santana,"This is basically a clone of ""Birth of Santana: The Complete Early Years"", even the songs are in the same order. The Anthology stopped while the Birth of Santana continue with six additional songs. I also like better the title ""Birth of Santana: The complete Early Years"" since it reflects the recordings before his first major label album. I should also point out that there are many clones/bootlegs versions of the early recordings of Santana before going to major labels. Careful what you buy, there are some very bad (specially live) recordings. Go with the known labels."
1,shower miror,The mirror is constructed well but the arm will not stay in place no matter how tight you get it. therefore it is not being used. Need arm that will bend etc.
1,This is not a fogless mirror. Misrepresentation and no reponse from supplier,"To call this a fogless mirror is a total misrepresentation. It fogs up immediately. I've requested return, but I'm being ignored. Both the product and the service deserve NO STARS!!! I HAVE BEEN RIPPED OFF!!!"
1,Cheap plastic parts - don't waste your money,"All the pieces for connecting to the plumbing/showerhead are made of cheap plastic. The threads didn't fit well at all, it leaks and then broke when I tried to tighten. Save your money for a well-made product."
2,"Fogless Mirror,","I would have been ok with this product, but it is made of plastic and not metal, for the price about four times what it is worth. It has all the things on itthat anyone is looking for in a fog less mirror but, then I put put it on. Themirror's base is made of plastic, not metal, the plastic stripped out and now this mirror that cost $100.00, four times what it should cost. Its now no good to me and I still need a fog less mirror for my shower. I may have been fine with the price if it would have work. but now I have a $100.00 piece of junk and no mirror and no one is sending me a new one..."
1,Don't Buy This Mirror,"Extremely disappointing. Paid a lot for this mirror and after two months of trying to get it to work without leaking i threw it out. Not only did it leak badly, but it appears to be made mostly of cheap plastic. And the metal piece that the razor hangs from had already begun to rust. This was a wast of money."
5,delightful,"I purchased these books over 30 years ago, and lost them during a move. I am thrilled I have found them again to have them available to read to future grandchildren"
2,Test Engineer,"I have used and liked many HP products, going back to the HP67 programmable calculator (c. 1978). I bought the HP 49G+ expecting it to be top-of-the-line, but it was a big disappointment and I decided to return the calculator within the 30-day trial period. The documentation is so inadequate that I was unable to use very much of the calculator's capabilities and gave up trying to learn in frustration. The User's Guide lacks an index; however, the manual on the included CD does! The HP 49G+ and the manual is very user un-friendly - for example, if you are in the financial mode, there is no obvious way to exit back to the calculator mode and the manual does not tell you how (press the NXT key). TI is coming out with a TI 84 Plus Silver Edition in Spring 2004 that looks promising: see http://education.ti.com/us/product/tech/84pse/features/features.html."
1,HP 49g+,"This calculator is a piece of crap! The plastic band has broke and snapped off and the key pad ""0"" wobbles! All after 1 and a half years of light use. Just long enough to get out of the warranty. They were kind enough to offer a replacement for $100 plus shipping. I've since returned to my 28C. HP no longer builds a quality product. Don't buy this!! I'm currently looking at buying the TI-89. I love the HP RPM but I can't spend $100+ (hense the name) every 1.5 years on calulators"
3,"Better than 49G, but HP could do better","Purchased two weeks ago, my 49G+ was built in mid January 2004, with ROM version 1.23, the keyboard appears to work properly.This calculator is so much better than the previous 49G that there is no real comparison. I returned my 49G soon after purchase back in 2002 because it was simply unusable. Not so with the 49G+. The buttons are good, almost as good as HP 48 series (but not excellent as on HP 41C series), and the processor speed and screen quality are much improved over previous 49G. Keyboard layout is the same. I haven't yet used all of the new 49G+ features, but so far it is working as expected. The hardcopy manual and larger online manual both contain many errors, and are lacking in several ways. They need improvement! The overall look and feel of the 49G+ are acceptable considering the $ price, but I'd much prefer HP to design a higher quality unit with a price point of $-$. I'm a committed RPN user, so TI has never been an option for me."
1,Disappointed,"This calculator is terrible. I've been a HP man for a long time and now that I'm doing my Ph.D EE I thought I'd upgrade from my beloved 48GX. Was that a mistake. The keyboard is worse than you could imagine !! Was any testing done at all ?!? Miskeys all the time, it's loud and uncomfortable. My Sd card didn't work and the screen flickers, I have a patch for that, when I get the time I'd FIX my calculator. The poor quality of this machine, hardware and software is inexcusable particularly for the price. Do not buy this calculator !!!"
1,Good but bad keyboard. Not a shadow of the 48GX,"When I first bought an HP48SX and later an HP48GX what I was most proud of it was it construction quality. My HP48SX felt from a two story height and survived. But what a dissapointment with the 49G. It doesn't feel like the others and just 5 months later of Office use (not field use) I have more than 3 keys loose and I don't think this calculator will last more than a year.If you want a calculator full of functions for just a year and not more. There you have it!But if you are like me, who wants a products that could stand longer... I recomend that you look somewhere else."
1,Disappointed - Buy the 50G!!!,"Buy the HP 50G instead! I use a calculator several times a day as an engineer. The keyboard is terrible. A number of the keys broke loose from their mounting. This made pressing keys very unreliable. I replaced it with a HP 50G which has a much better keyboard. The 50G is better, but still doesn't measure up to the excellent mechanical design (and same software) of the 48SX and 48GX. These may still be available and would be the best choice depending on the price. I had a 48SX that I used from my first day of college up to 8 years working. The on/off button finally wore out and I replaced it with this terrible 49G+."
4,time to send,I would like to know when will be sent the calculator hp 49 g+? it was bought two days ago. thanks
1,Not worth the price,"It's a self destructing machine. Buttons that get stuck, display that looses vertical lines.....Don't buy it."
2,Excellent calc... but TI is better...,"I bought this calculator because of past experience with hp 48gx. Because my hp 48gx broke down, I bought hp 49g+, when I first used my brand new calc, I was impressed about the design, it was more luxury than practical though, just 2 months of 'none-intense' use and 3 keys from the keyboard are like ""hanging in the air"", i said wow how delicated is this, thank god i havent drop it down yet. I also have to remark that key registration on screen is deficient. I did chose HP because of its compatibility and you can find lots of helpful programs on Internet, but next time, I will pick Texas Instrument for my next calculator, is better and cheaper.Sorry HP, you killed yourself with this product, you have lost a customer."
2,Not ready for prime time,"This is a fast calculator with a host of features, such as a really good symbolic and computational algebra & calculus system. The display is quite large and readable. It comes with a nice leather case.But it has severe problems, too. The keys don't always register (HP told me that this is solved in currently shipping models; this remains to be seen, I had two that didn't reliably register keystrokes). Even worse, the calculator crashed. Yes, it locked up during a routine task, and had to have its batteries removed (and memory reset) before it would respond to keystrokes. I exchanged my first 49G+, and then returned the second for exactly the same unacceptable behavior.If you want a calculator for light use, graphing, no programming, this might be a good one to get. If you want one that is reliable, I suggest that you look for a used 48GX or 48G+, at least until they work out the bugs in early production versions of the 49G+. My problems were in November 2003."
4,overall i think its good,i have had it since x-mas 05 and i think it is a good calculator. this is my first graphix calc. [im a freshmen in high school] and i am pleased. it is much faster than the ti83's my school has and it has many more capabilities. i found it easy to use and my only copmplaint is the keyboard.
2,"Fast, noisy, and no equation library","This thing is faster than the 48G by a significant margin, but the keys are so loud that I wouldn't want to use it in a classroom when taking a test. And if you're looking for the equation library's list of equations, you won't find it. The 48G's keyboard looked cooler, too. The arrows on the 49 aren't labeled, and the NXT key is in the wrong place. I'm going to let my dad use it, and I'll keep using the 48G."
1,49G owner,"I didn't dare upgrade to this model when my 49G suddenly stopped working. I read the 49G+ manual and it's basically the same, tired design. Over my years of ownership I wanted to like my 49G but I never really did. It was slow, the keyboard response poor and the software mediocre. After I upgraded the flash memory to an official version the symbolic integration stopped working. I wish HP did so much more, but they aren't. I need to buy a new calculator - guess I'm getting a TI-89 Titanium. How about their non-graphing calculator design with the v-shaped keyboard - ridiculous. Engineers don't need marketing flash - who's running their company? HP calculators need to be rescued. Professional engineers have money for a nice calculator, why are they skimping? Even though computers obsolete some calculator functionality, if designed well, calculators are still indispensable."
1,good processor poor mechanics,"The processor is very good, and the calculator more powerful than the TI 89, which in a way is too bad, because the cheap poor construction, bad keys, broken bezel after 4 months, and lack of documentation disappoint, and makes one mourn for what might have been had HP spent another couple of bucks to better house their concept."
2,POOR Keyboard Quality,"I have owned several HP calculators: 15C, 28C, 28S, 48S, 48GX, and the 49G. I was dissapointed with the 49G (it was slow and had flimsy keys and a poor screen) so I purchased the 49G+ when it came out. Unfortunately, the keyboard on the 49G+ is soooo BAD it is nearly useless. Even though the keys ""click"" when pressed, at least 25% of the time the keypresses DON'T REGISTER. You have to look at the screen to verify EACH and EVERY keypress, otherwise you could make a mistake and not know it...I recommend WAITING until the keyboard problem is resolved, if HP will fix it. At this time (12/03) they haven't admitted the problem..."
1,Poor calculator built on a great history,"As an engineer, I've used nothing but hp calculators due to their obvious superiority. When I used my hp48gx to it's grave, and a lot of use/abuse it took, I bought the newest and ""best"" hp on the market... I was sorely mistaken. This calculator has poor key response and is prone to malfunction. The reliability of my calculator is key to me, and I plan on returning this one and getting a used 48gx. Hopefully the next generation hp calculator will return to past quality."
5,Best Calculator Ever,"I just got my 49g+ to replace my 49g (which I personally thought was a fine calculator). The g+ is better in every respect. The new screen is beautiful, the extra speed is very noticable, and I'm delighted to get the option of infrared back. Every complaint that I'd heard about the 49g is fixed in the 49g+. Even if I weren't a long-time RPN addict, I'd pick this calculator over a TI89 or 92.Incidentally, I've had no problems with the keyboard at all."
1,Worst thing to happen to HP calculators,"I will make my point in less than a few sentences. This calculator is the largest mistake that HP Calculator division has ever made. It is simply a build on the HP48ish code with some speed improvements - that I can accept. What I CANNOT accept is the sorry excuse for a keyboard and user interface. My calculator died just after a few months. From what I read online, HP lost the ability to design the old style reliable key interface in the 48G series graphing and the 32SII series scientific. I'm glad I still have my 48GX and use my 49G+ warranty replacement as a neglected backup. What I want is the same form factor as my 48GX with much more speed and fancy features (todays graphics) with the same reliability - not too much to ask."
2,Can't trust the results due to the poor quality of the device,"I cannot trust the answer this calculator provides due to the bad keyboard. The problem with the keyboard is that not all key presses are recognized by the calculator even though the key was firmly pressed. What this means is, unless you very careful and double check you calculator usage, the answer cannot be trusted. From this point of view, the calculator has negative value!Btw, this is my second HP 49g+. I used HP's warranty and returned the first as defective."
2,Horrible,"This calculator is terrible. At first the keys didn't register then they release a firmware upgrade that has keys registering twice or more, for instance I press 1 and I get two or three 1s on the screen. Many people including myself at first would think that complaining about the keypad is just nitpicking but the keypad is really so bad that it makes the calculator nearly useless. Also the key presses make a loud hollow sound which tends to be distracting in a quiet environment such as a classroom during an exam. Next, considering the processor and software running on this calculator hp could've made an effort to put an improved display on it but they didn't. I give it 2 stars because the CAS is really genial although the documentation is so bad, it makes it really hard to learn."
1,The worst calculator from HP !!,I use HP calculators my entire professional life. This is the worst one I see. I purchased TWO HP 49G+. One for myself and the other for my son. The first one failed within one month - my son told me that it has funny characters on the screen. Mine just failed (4 months old). The thing just won't turn on and have some black vertical lines on the screen.
5,A+ product,"The Knot Book of Wedding Gowns is a great book, and, thanks to Amazon, I bought it for an incredible price. I'm so glad I added this book to my personal library."
2,Alright I guess...,"This book was okay, I would suggest reading through it in a bookstore. No need to spend the money."
5,Awesome score for a sub-par movie,"""Judge Dredd""s infamy as one of Sylvester Stallone's worse flicks is not unheard of, however deep inside it's cinematic mess lies a fantastic score by the great Alan Silvestri, it's a very fine piece of work that frankly was deserving of a much better movie. Underrated for sure, not a masterpiece but definitely the best thing that ever came out of this movie"
3,Why no Anthrax?,"Pretty decent overall, especially for a soundtrack- but Anthrax's ""I am the law"" off of the excellent Among the Living would have been a PERFECT fit... yeah yeah, I know these are record companies, so everything is always unduly difficult, but even so- the song is damn good, and would add the much needed punch that this disc lacks. It was written in 1986 and based on the comic book series- like the movie, of course."
1,I didn't this watch,The last month I buy this item but when I open the box this is empty. I write to Macy's and Amazon costumer service but I don't receive the answer to my claim but thos value was charged to my credit card.
5,Playing Lionel Traintown,"We have two ""special"" grandsons. One has Asberger's Syndrone and the other is Autistic. One of the things that both of these boys love is trains. This game will probably have to be replaced at some point because they play is so much when they are here. We are so fortunate that there are special ed programs that are helping these kids so much. They are great guys and we love them to pieces. This is an excellent source of pleasure for them. Also train videos and we take them to model railroad museums and on as many train rides as we can. We are really lucky to have these boys. And they are so fortunate for what is out there for them. Trains being a BIG thing."
3,Bayou Classic Cast Iron Skillet,"Bought these pans for $30.00 thinking they would be pretty decent, I got them very well packaged. I took them out and on the 10"" Pan there was a small defect in the pan like a little gash that was missing some of the coating of the cast Iron. It didn't bother me that much though. So me and the Wife seasoned them all and Cooked on the 10"" one. It worked great there kind of rough not as smooth as my 12"" but I bought these for camping so I really don't care. I think after a period of extended use it will smooth out. All in all they are definitely worth the $30.00.. Would definitely recommend these for Campers."
1,damaged item,This set arrived with the large pan damaged - a worn spot on the pan as if a grinder had been used to scour the metal maybe to remove a defect left a bare spot the size of a quarter. I asked for a return the same day and as usual amazon responded immediately. These pans are probably a good product but I didn't get the chance to try them. I didn't think it was possible to damage cast iron - fooled me
5,Cast Iron Skillet,Bought these as a gift for my kids. My daughter took hers camping and loved it. Can't hardly beat cooking over a camp fire in a cast iron skillet. I use mine to cook cornbread in. It makes the cornbread just taste better.
4,great!,The pre-seasoning will burn/gunk away and it will take a while to properly preseason the base but I like these skillets. Good price.
3,its very small,"I can't complain considering the price paid. They are small as mentioned in other reviews, The quality is OK but it does seem like they will require more maintenance than my other cast iron cookware."
2,Not what I expected.,"I ordered this because I like cooking with cast iron. It is very poor quality. Has too much pitting, has too many rough spots around edges and handles. Some of them are very sharp. Stick to Lodge, everyone!"
4,Really good,"This is a really good set - maybe not QUITE as good a quality as Lodge, but it does fine, and was less expensive. If you've never had cornbread fixed in an 8"" cast iron skillet, then you definitely need to order this and try it."
2,Not a good choice,"When I received these pans, they were so rough that I couldn't ever see getting a smooth finish by seasoning them. I returned them and wouldn't recommend them."
4,Corum continued.,"This volume collects the second trilogy in the saga of Corum Jhaelen Irsei and consists of ""The Bull and the Spear"", ""The Oak and the Ram"", and ""The Sword and the Stallion"". Corum, for those of you who are not familiar with Moorcock, is an incarnation of the Eternal Champion. In this trilogy, Corum is called into the distant future to assist in the battle against the Fhoi Myore. While there, he learns some important lessons about love and belonging.I have to confess that Corum is probably my least favorite of the incarnations of the Eternal Champion-- I like both Elric and Hawkmoon better. All the same, you have the general elements of Moorcock greatness-- brooding reluctant hero, the companion & his cat, and a strong tie in to historical myth and legend.Start with the Swords Trilogy, and not here, if you have read no Corum before. The backstory is helpful to understand character motivation, if nothing else."
3,"Not Bad, But Not Great Either","I purchased this CD at the suggestion of my teenage daughter. Some of the songs are soothing, peaceful, and carry a nice message, such as the song ""God's Gift"". Although the lyrics are good, his heavy overuse of what sounds like an electronic harp on most songs, at times makes the melodies seem somewhat monotonous. Listen to the song samples on your computer's media player to get an idea of what I'm talking about. Perhaps it won't affect you the same way, but it was enough for me to store the CD away after listening the second time."
5,Better than the first,"I haven't watched the dvd of this film, but I saw it in the theater twice. Absolutely hilarious is all I can say. Far better than the first, Myers realized the importance and laugh potential of dr. evil and used it perfectly. Fat bastard was a funny addition to the cast. Buy it and you won't be sorry"
3,this movie is just as good as the first austin powers,this movie is one of the funniest movies of 1999. the chemistry of dr.evil and mini-me is great.and the fight with austin and mini-me is one of the funniest things i have ever seen.all in all its a good movie but it still isnt as good as the original
5,This movie is the best,"I watched this film at the cinema and it was a laugh a minute. It was totally fantastic and all my friends enjoyed it too, I dont think my mom would approve of all the scenes or the script but I certainly enjoyed it."
5,This kicks for a sequel,"Sequels are never as good as the original, but this movie is about the best you can do. They did run some of the old jokes into the ground, but overall it was another awesome Austin Powers movie. I loved it!"
1,"Great Movie, But DVD Quality is Bad","I have now purchased two copies of The Spy Who Shagged Me, (local store, not Amazon) and one was unplayable and the other had menu selections that shut the DVD player off. I have not had similar problems with any other DVD. Obviously some QC problems at New Line. You might want to wait to buy this, and maybe just rent it while you wait for New Line to get their act together."
4,"Better than the first, but similar","The Spy Who Shagged Me was better than the first one. The movie is very funny, especially Dr. Evil. I think that Dr. Evil is much funnier than Austin. I also think Frau and Mini-Me are good in this money. I didn't like Young Number Two, but Robert Wagner was good as Old Number Two. I did not like the Felicity Shagwell character. I thought Vanessa was much funnier. I also disliked the way the plot was almost exactly the same as the first one (Austin stopping Dr. Evil from taking over the world, almost killing him after taking over the world, the same jokes, the same idea, etc.) I would expect Felicity be a fem-bot in the third movie if there is one. This is a funny movie, but in a way stupid."
2,Bad Movie Baby!,"After watching the Spy Who Shagged Me I was disappointed. I found it be a rehash from the first movie. The same lines,jokes, and nothing more. I found parts of the movie to be funny, however I felt the movie could of offer more."
2,Can someone say Austin Powers re-run?,"This was not worth the money. Same cast, same jokes. The only person that was shagged was me when I paid to watch this."
1,What a disappointment!,"Similar to most sequels this was a total ZERO. I loved the original and was looking forward to the second. Unfortunately, whereas the original was clever, charming and funny- the sequel takes the low road straight down into bathroom humor. Just hilarious for those under 12. All others are advised to avoid. Myers needs a new project!"
1,this move stinks,this move was so stupid that my dog didn't watch it. this move was so stupid that the director didn't watch it. this move stinks so bad that you have to call the epa. this move stinks so bad that the skunks runawy from it. this move was so weird that weird al didn't make a song about it
3,I liked the older one more,"I probably gave it 3 stars because I've seen the older one, which was much more funnier and less focused on Austin's ""Mojo"". My favorite character was Mini-Me, which could be the only funny thing about this movie that was not copied from the older Austin Powers movie. This is one movie I wished I'd rented before buying."
1,"No, baby, no!","I think NOT. One Austin Powers movie was MORE than enough. It's funny for about 10 seconds. The rug of hair on his chest, hillarious British accent, disgusting teeth, etc... this could have been a good comedy. But it gets very old very quickly. All this movie consists of is a few good laughs, and A LOT of pointless sex jokes."
1,very bad remake,This is really a very poor remake of the first version. There's not very much of original and new jokes. I was very much looking forward to this one but its not funny AT ALL. Spare your money on this one.
3,TOTALLY GROOVY,I'M TOTALLY NOT HAPPY WITH THIS MOVIE BECAUSE THE FIRST ONE WAS TEN TIMES BETTER BECAUSE THE NEW ONE TRIES TO HARD TO BE FUNNY! IT OVER DOES EVERYTHING!
2,"Weak, Really Really Weak, Baby","I didn't care too much for the first Austin Powers movie, and I had pretty much the same reaction to this sequel.I kept reading positive reviews while it was at the theater and people I work with were telling me how funny it was. What a waste of time....I can't believe I managed to stay awake for the whole thing. It just wasn't funny at all...and some of the jokes were SO corny, that I found myself wondering if they were bad on purpose as part of the humor...but I don't think so. Glad I got my copy for free."
3,First was better,I prefered the first Austin Powers movie. It was like they were recycling jokes from the first movie. Don't get me wrong its not a totally bad film. It has its moments
5,Funny and very original,"It's interesting ""shagging"" is an idiom born in the British Public school system (Private schools), and naturally means copulating. A very popular expression in the 50's and 60's. I remember American debs visiting our school hadn't a clue what it meant, which made it all the more fun talking about shagging! The ""F"" word was never used by young gentlemen. That was the last time I actually heard the word used in person.Austin Powers asks Felicty Shagwell to leave the 60's behind and come with him to the 90's. Shagwell replies she will miss the 70's and 80's. Austin Powers then makes the most profound statement of the whole film - ""you won't miss anything, Baby!"" A reference to the mind numbing decades of PC. The humor may be high school, but the message is definately adult! The PG13 rating is appropriate. A good laugh!"
2,Austin Powers- the spy who bored me,"What a disapointement! The original was funny and entertaining, this one was extremely boring. Only a few scenes (not the tent one) are actually fun to watch. Is Mike Myers finished or is he been lazy trying to make quick bucks?"
3,Better luck next time...,"When I saw ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" in the theater, I thought it was much better than the first. But having watched both pictures over again, there is no question in my mind that the first was far superior. Besides the recycling of jokes, skits, and spoofs from the original, the sequel offers very little new material. Unfortunantly, the material available relys too heavily on raunchy and tasteless humor and lacks the spunk and creativity from the original. If you are a diehard fan, buy it! If not don't waste the money."
2,The Same Plot,"This movie was the same as the first. I saw this movie beforethe first one and thought it was decent, but very funny. When I sawthe first later on, I realized that this was like a copy. It had the same exact plot (Austin escaping Evil and Evil wanting to kill Austin and take over the world) and the same jokes ..."
2,A mostly DVD review,"I loved the first film, I gave it the highest rating. I found this one just replayed the a lot of the old jokes and they just weren't as funny second time around. The DVD seems to have more extras but again I don't think they're as good as the previous DVD. The deleted scenes weren't great and you can tell why they were cut, they aren't that funny. I was really disappointed with the commentary. It too wasn't as funny as previously and seemed a bit forced. I don't like commentary where you don't have to actually watch the film to listen to it, a lot of it was like that. The Dr. Evil biography was funny, but I'd have trouble watching it over and over. The music videos were great, but will you buy a DVD for the music videos? Probably not. I have this in my collection for the few scenes I found funny like the Jerry Springer scene."
5,A smashing sequel!!!!,"Yo... Saw this when I was 8, and I loevd it! It was so much better than the 1st!PLOT: Dr. evil returns to earth. He then plans to steal AP's mojo and austin discovers it, he is hooked up with a hot chick to steal back his mojo. Then Fat Bastard is introduced, a fat scottish guy who steals APs mojo. And Doctor evil has a 1/8 size clone named Mini Me. Then he changes the moon into a death star.Thoughts: Good, but I thought Goldmember was better.See it!"
1,Alright another sequel they dont have enough of those,There were a lot of stupid jokes in this movie first Dr Evil just replaced ssshhh with zip it.2nd the reason the first movie worked so well is because we are watching someone out of place with the time while in the sequel Austin is in the 90s and everyone accepts him acting like its the 6os.Although Heather Graham is shaggadelic she didnt bring anything to the movie
1,Unoriginal and forgettable,What do you do when your movie is a hit and all the kids use your catch phrase? You churn out another movie using the same jokes with a weaker script. Such is this dog of a movie. the biggest disappointment for 1999. Mini-me? Can anyone tell me what was funny about this character? Mike Myers has more talent than this but I guess money is more important than making a good movie. Remember Wayne's World 2?
1,Overrated----and not that funny baby,This movie was stupid--sort of one joke that went on for hours.Bits that were funny at first became boring.
1,Don't regret...,"I don't understand how this movie gross over $200 mil. I didn't see it on a big screen, but I'm glad I didn't. So, I watched it by renting it at Blockbuster, and I totally disgusted by bad actings, no plot(not even a comedy), and mostly I hated what he's name a dork from SNL.. constantly repeating the word yeah baby... He's totally not that funny and I want to say to him to shut the hell up.. To people considering purchasing the video or dvd, listen to me don't waste your money you don't have to make him a dork from SNL rich.I wish I could give it no star review but 1 star is the lowest rate I could give."
3,Rent Before Buying!,"I bought this video without renting it first because I was sure it would be a hit based on how good the first one was. It was OK, but had I rented it first, I probably would have passed on buying it. It was just a little too much of the same, while the storyline wasn't nearly as good as the first in my opinion. Especially bothersome was the reappearance of the ""shhhh"" and ""zip-it"" gags. I almost wanted to fast-forward through these sequences since they were only ""funny"" the first time, and even then, they weren't that funny. Why they had to include them twice more in this film is beyond me. (unless of course they needed to pad the film so that it would last its 95 minute length)"
5,This movie is the best from Mike Myers yet! Terrific!,"very groovy! I thought shagged me was better than the original. my favorite charecter was Dr.Evil. You have to see this movie. If you haven't, you should. Mike Myers is the best actor alive! But he couldn't have done it without Heather Grahm,Robert Wagner, The guy who played young number2,Verne Troyer, and Mr. Bigglesworth. You guys are the funniest."
2,Bulletproof this movie is my all time favorite move.SMASHING,I tought that this movie is one of the best comedys i have ever seen ithought it was shagadelic.
4,Not as good as the original,"Not up to the standard of the first film (too much is simply repeated from the first film). However, still very funny.The best bit of this DVD is the plethora of extra fetures, with some very good out-takes. Also, the quality of the picture is amongst the best I have in my DVD collection and the sound is excellent (although it does not really get the chance to shine like, say, the Matrix).Overall, an excellent package for an above average to very good film."
1,doesn't play correctly on my dell!,"funny movie, i ordered the dvd, when it arrived i tried playing it on my dell but it crashes it everytime. no other dvd i have (17+) causes this problem. it plays fine on my mac G4 though. beware of the PC problem. best of luck"
3,Funny but Not for kids,"I loved the first movie, and this one isn't too bad for adults but I wouldn't let kids watch it. I let my 8 year old watch the first one (some reservations), but after watching this one, I'm afraid it is a little too mature for him - he's 9 now. I question if it isn't too mature even for 13 year olds. Too many blatant sex jokes, geared toward an older audience."
1,Nutty Reviews,"I saw the movie a few days ago after waiting several months to see it. I was excited when I popped the cassette into the VCR. After all, the first movie was incredibly funny, sharp and a bit zany. This one was terrible. Midway through the film I thought, ""Perhaps this is part of the joke...that the movie is making fun of itself by starting off terribly..."" I was embarrassed for having rented it. The jokes were forced and silly; the product promotion was sickening. That's okay though. I still feel that Mike Myers is an excellent comedian, I just wonder about two things. First, in his heart of hearts, does he really think he made a good movie? Or does he (Myers) know that he rushed it, and came out with an inferior product? And, seond, how in the world could so many people have enjoyed this movie? Some reviewers went as far as to call it the ""greatest movie ever."" Perhaps for children yes, but for any thinking person? Eh-eh. You have to be kidding me."
4,Hilarious,"All truth be told, the only reason I orginally bought this movie was because Steve Wilkos was in it.I didn't see the first movie, so I really wasn't sure what to expect from this one. However, I quickly found out that previous knowledge of what happens in the first movie isn't needed to enjoy the second one.Basic plot: Austin Powers is trying to save the world and meets some chick along the way that helps him.The movie opens with Austin and Vanessa on their honeymoon. Their marital bliss soon shattered when Austin realizes Vanessa is a fem-bot sent by Dr. Evil to kill him.Since the robot didn't work, Dr. Evil steals Austin's mojo!The rest of the movie is Austin and Felicity (Heather Graham) trying to get Austin's mojo back and stop Dr. Evil from going through with the Alan Parsons Project, which will slam an asteriod into the Earth while Dr. Evil and his crew are safe in outer space.There is a lot of sexual humor that isn't appropriate for younger audiences. It is definitely a PG-13 film."
5,The best of the three. Buy this one first.,"This is no doubt the best of the Austin Powers series. In the 5-star sequel, Austin must travel to 1969 to prevent Dr. Evil from taking over the world. Plus there's two new villains: Fat B@$!@%d (also played by Mike Myers) And Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), who are working for Dr. Evil and present many hilarious occurences even when they're off-screen."
2,Big Disappointment,"The first Austin Powers is one of my favorite movies because there is nothing else just like it. It had many clever references to culture that make it funny every time you watch it, and the sayings from it were hilarious. ""Saucer of milk, table two."" This one is MUCH more lowbrow in its attempts for laughs. Much of the humor in it centers around anuses and their products, and frankly is more disgusting than funny. The Spy Who Shagged Me seems like a movie put together by a person who had read about Austin Powers and tried to force a second movie out of it. None of the brilliance of the first movie is present here."
4,A Very Shagadelic Movie!,"The movie is so much funnier than the original. As for the extras on the DVD, they are great! Commentary, but they stopped near the ending which I thought was bit wierd, with Mike Myers, the director and one of the writers, I think. Well, how about some deleted scenes? Some of them are so funny that you wonder why they didn't put them in the movie. Behind the scenes, very interseting. Trailers, filmographies and three music videos. A very good, solid package. I'm talking about the Region 2 version, so the Region 1 version is probably a bit better regarding the extras."
2,i dont get why people like this movie,i love comedy movies but this is kinda stupid. Mike meyers is incredibally annoying in this movie. the first one was a little better. The only reason this movie did so well is because mtv promoted so much and every little teenie bopper had to run out and see it just because mtv said to. For real comedy go with dumb and dumber or ferris beullers day off they are ten times funnier.
1,One Austin Powers Movie Is Enough!,"This second spy/Bond parody movie then becomes extremely repetitive and boring - the same old childish jokes using sexual innuendo, potty-humor, and over-acting. Robert Wagner continues as #2, a drab role for a former star. The 'plot' centers around Austin having lost his sex drive and has to return to the sixties to get it back. Somehow we also get a cameo Jerry Springer appearance."
4,wrong product description from amazon!!!,why is amazon giving the wrong product description of this Austin Powers comedy?.i'm giving 4 stars to this great little comedy with Mike Meyers and Heather Graham--but it is not a demonic thriller with Anthony Hopkins as amazon has described!!!
1,Cult Film with a gross twist,"My Arkansas son in law loved the film, but the rest of the clan gave it a thumbs down. Plot was weak, some really gross scenes, action was a bit slow. It was obvious that millions was spent on the film, and you did get a taste of the 60's. Mike Myers playing three roles was interesting."
2,This movie is gross,This movie is grosser than the first and the third is probably the worst. Gross out humor is not funny or amusing. Movies like Austin Powers appeals to the lowest level of intelligence. It is a shame that college students finds this garbage funny. There are scenes that are too disgusting to describe.The story centers around Austin Powers and his arch rival Dr. Evil. Dr. Evil has a clone called Mini Me. I gave this film two stars instead of one because Micheal Myers was generally funny as Austin Powers and Dr. Evil.
2,Very Unoriginal.,"Dumb swinger secret agent- beautiful assistant he falls in love with- dull yet wacky enemy. Sounds alot like another movie I know of, what was it called, oh yeah- The First ""Austin Powers"". The original was very funny and original, it was a slap in the face to most comedies at the time. Unfortunitely, ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" is basically the same thing, except Austin Powers goes back in time again. Its so predictable, because it is all the same gags as the first Austin Powers. Now all these kids are quoting this movie, and think that it is so hilarious, it was hilarious the first time it happened, then they basically made a carbon copy. Also, the original Austin Powers was a flop, not many people saw in the theatre, but word got around, and every body saw it when it was released on video, which is the making of a great comedy. If you already own the original, you dont need to buy this, because you pretty much already own it."
1,"remember pet detective, Truman ?","Just when you thought comedies couldn't go any lower, Austin Powers does.The Truman Show (although not a comedy) was funnier than this. If you hated Wayne's World, don't dare watch this one! This movie tries to sell itself on cheap sexual innuendo ; come to think of it, that's all this movie is about. Another Saturday Night Live disaster."
1,THE WORST....,1 STAR RATING IS STILL TO HIGH OF A RATING FOR THIS MOVIE. THE ONLY THING WORST WOULD BE A JIM CARREY MOVIE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY ON THIS VIDEO.
4,Dr. Evil's movie,"This sequal to the first austin powers is not quite as good as the first one, but it's not that bad. Austin power's character has pretty much been reduced to nothing in this movie. Heather Graham's character is just in the movie for eye candy. That leaves Dr. Evil, who pretty much has all of the funny scene's in the movie. Although, I thought the whole thing with him trying to be a rapper was stupid. Fat Bastard's character was ok, but it got dull after a while. Overall: I think you should check it out just for dr. evil's scenes in the movie."
4,Just as good as the original,This one was just as good as the original. It is one of my favorite comedies of all time. My favorite characters are Mini-Me and Fat Bastard. This was a really funny movie.
3,Depends how you watch the movie..,"When I first saw this film on the recommendation of a friend, I thought it was horrendous! I couldn't believe how pathetic the jokes were and how it managed to get so much acclaim. However...I watched it again and it started to grow on me. Some of the gags are just too pathetic for a sane mind however you look at it. The part where he is interrogating the driver for example. It goes on way too long. And do I even need to mention the coffee pot thing? The 007 rip-off gags are great, but you have to be really with it as far as Bond movies go to get the jokes because it is jam-packed with corny Bond stuff. You want examples? OK, Mini-me - remember Nik Nak ""Golden Gun"", piano playing scene - Drax, well, the list goes on. I like the musical numbers too. It kind of balances out the pathetic parts of Dr Evil's gag lines. Anyway, I haven't seen the first one yet but I am going to rent it out tonight! Yeah baby, yeah!"
5,The Best DVD Ever!,"""Austin Powers:The Spy Who Shagged Me"" Is One Of The Funniest Movies Of The 90's. I Had Rented It On Video Once And Really Enjoyed It, But About A Month Later I Got A DVD And Rented It On DVD, It Was So Cool! Interactive Menues,Behind The Scenes,A ""Hidden"" Dr.Evil Lair,music Videos And Soooooo Much More! And The Movie......It Looked So Good, And Funny! Austin Powers Is The Kind Of Movie You Can Watch 5 Times And Still Not Get Sick Of It. This Is Were The Whole ""Mini-Me"" Thing Came From! Well, Bye!"
4,A great movie!,"Wow, I was very impressed with this one! This is one of the few sequels that I have seen that I like even better than the original. The story involves much more insight on Dr. Evil, than Austin Powers. This packs the movie with tons of laughs!"
4,This Movie was the Bomb Diggity!!!!,"I thought this one is way better than the first. I never laughed so hard for any movie than for this. The characters were great especially ""Minnie-Me and Fat Bastard""!!! It seemed like I laughed from beginning to end. This is definitely a MUST-BUY video. Go and Get it!!!!"
2,Meyers in top form in uneven sequel,"The comic genius of Mike Meyers is once again in top form in this sequel. His greatest creation continues to be Dr. Evil, who eclipses our hero in interest here. The humor ranges from dry and witty to the truly revolting. The make-up that transforms Meyers into the disgustingly obese Fat Bastard earned an Oscar nomination. Not for every taste."
1,ONE OF THE WORST EVER,"I cannot tell you how bad this film is. There are not enough words in the english language to describe how DISGUSTING this ""blockbuster"" manages to be. The character of ""Fat Bastard"" is a sickening stereotype that enrages me so much I pass out. The ""Plot"" is contradicting, illogical and erratic. Everything about this movie makes me want to buy every copy and destroy them. I would destroy every print of this film in the whole world if I could. Austin Powers is one of the most annoying characters ever created. If he is supposed to be British why does he have such a stupid name? No British people have names like that. Especially in the '60s. He was obviously born in the '30s or late '20s. People didn't have name like that then! Duh! Every single character in this movie is a PATHETIC stereotype and I advise you to steer clear. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD stear clear!"
1,One of the Worst films I ever seen!,"I remember when this film came out all the hype it got,why! This movie isn't funny at all and either was the first one! Mike Myers has to be one of the worst actor we have today,maybe with the exception of Adam Sandler. Woody Allen made a film called ""Celebrity"" in which Woody shows how people flock to see junk! WHY IS THIS MOVIE SUCH A HUGH PART OF OUR CULTURE!"
1,A funny man decides to be sick and gross instead,"The first movie was good, but rank. This second movie is rank, but rank. Other than a fresh and attractive leading lady, there is nothing here but bathroom humor, worn out sex jokes, and long close ups of Dr. Evil's facial expressions that got old in the first 5 minutes of the last movie. Meyers is a very funny man, but not this time."
2,I thought this movie should've never been made.,"I liked the first Austin Powers, but it wasen't worth all that money to make. It got so old after awhile."
2,doesnt compare to the first,"belive me, i was an all out fan of the original. but this one was awful, i mean the repeated all the original jokes and it tried to do to much in what time it had. it had an apsolutely unbeliveble story line. and in my opinion what they did to dr evil in this movie was insulting, they used him far better in the first one. and who just wanted to slug mini me every time he came on? i mean he was funny at first but enough is enough. but there still were a few original scenes that i laughed really hard at. the far better comedy of the summer would have to go to hands down south park: bigger longer and uncut, for its creativity and all out funny script. if your new to austin powers see the original, it is far funnier and wittier. i hope the do better on the next sequal"
1,What a bore!,"If you liked the first Austin Powers, rent it again. The second one only offers a few more sexy women and dull, boring jokes (if you can call them jokes). One of Meyer's worst films. Get So I Married an Axe Murderer if you want outlandish comedy. Not this. The funniest thing about this movie is the paradies my friends make about it."
4,Good movie,"I though that the 1st auston powers was great, and the 2nd one was good too. It was immensley funny and mini me was a little scarry at times, but it was cool. I am a big seth fan, so I thought that his part was great, I love Scott Evil and the little ""fights"" he gets into with Dr.Evil."
5,GRRREAT!,"This movie is the funniest movie I have ever seen. My mom let my friend and I see it the first day it came out, then the day after all of her friends said don't let your kids see it. It was too late, but we loved it. My mom just saw it and hated it. It is a great movie for teens and people in their early twenties. Most adults didn't like it."
5,"Mini Me, even better than Oddjob","While my soccer loving roommate hates Mike Myers, I find this movie to be even better than the first. Mini Me is so funny, I love the scene when he dives across the table to grab the last cookie."
1,Not as good as the first....,"Mike Myers is a comic genius but this sequel is not as good as the first: it relies on characters and jokes created in the first movie; it relies on crude and offending gags; it's reduced to toilet humor. You might want to rent it, but certainly not own it."
2,"Austin doesn't really put the ""SEE"" in sequel","The second installment of Austin Powers was, as the rule goes, not as good as the original. The film played like a younger brother trying to be popular by coining all his older brother's jokes. There are plenty of times that that I found the film trying way too hard to be funny--almost to the point of being ""Naked-Gun""esque. Myers, however, was of course great as he adds another character to his name in the credits. This movie wasn't a total loss, by any stretch though. The addition of Mini-Me and early plot twist involving Vanessa Kinsington were inspired. However, let's hope that Myers and Co. can get their script-writing mojo back if they decide to throw us a third bone, people."
1,"Stupid, Stupid, Stupid!","This movie was the worst. They should have left it alone with the first one. Most movies are not made to be sequels. This was one of them. Im glad I didn't see it in the movies, because I would have been mad I spent $8 on it. To keep it short and sweet, what were the thinking?"
1,Never had mojo to start with,"While thoroughly bawdy, the original ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" managed to hold enough charm to be entertaining. Sadly, the same cannot be said for this retreaded story.There is really nothing new here, and bawdiness for its own sake isn't really funny. What few chuckles there are in the film are more than counterbalaced by groans. Mike Myers does a decent job in protraying multiple characters, but this could have been easily done in a few SNL skits rather than wasting a lot of celluloid footage in the effort.The somewhat open ending left the possibility of a 3rd Austin Powers. All I can say is I HOPE NOT.Without a doubt, Wayne's World was MUCH better!"
1,"Too, Too Bad, Baby!","The first movie was cute...This one (like Austin himself), ate SH$T! Mike Myers went overboard with a good joke and ruined the whole thing! Offensive does not always equal Funny....My Score: GROSS"
1,Quite possibly the biggest letdown I've ever experienced!,"Now, first off let me say that I absolutely adored the first film. The jokes came thick and fast, they were actually funny and it had Liz Hurly to boot. The sequel however, has unfunny jokes that come thick and fast, no script structure and virtually no laughs. I laughed literally at 3 instances in this movie. And it wasn't even a laugh; it was a smile at best. What the producers seemed to have learned is that instead of actually putting jokes into the script, they can simply have Myers walk around and do that accent for 2 hours. This is passed off as comedy to Americans, who seem to find this highly amusing. Thus, after leaving the theatre, I was greeted with a chorus of irritating 13 - 18 year old males saying (in the worst possible accents) ""Shag me, baby!"" and ""Oh behave"". Now they may think this is cute, but trust me, it gets annoying after the first 500 times!"
2,CAN YOU SAY ENOUGH ALREADY?,"We've all seen the original. Yeah, everybody loved it. Don't ask me why. Aside from a few good James Bond-spoofing jokes, I thought Austin Powers was thoroughly unenjoyable. That's my humble opinion. My not-so-humble opinion is that Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me goes too far (Fat Bastard's stool sample...the horror...). If you want to see a funny movie, go rent Clerks, Wayne's World, or even Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. If you want to watch yet another game of ""how many ways can we hide Mike Myers' private parts,"" this movie is for you.Incidentally, there were some funny bits, but they didn't come close to saving the rest of this mess."
5,"Groovy Baby,,,",This Austin Powers movie was the funniest movie of the summer. This movie made me almost cry as I was laughing so hard. This Austin Powers has more of Dr.Evil than the first one. When this comes out on video I am buying it. It is a must see movie. The PG-13 rating was a good deal.
5,Not like the other movies...,"When I first saw the comercial for Austin Powers I thought it was a trick comercial or something they did for fun. But then I saw the movie and I was really impressed. The movie is a whole new type of movie, and it was extremly funny. There wasn't one second of the movie where I wasn't lauging! The movie is great! Even my parents thought it was fabulous! If you don't see this movie, you are missing..."
5,a very good movie,its a very good mocie as in you'll gonna enjoy it if you cantsee it ur be missing the most interested movie in ur entire life asyoull gonna regret it and start blaming uself for not seeing this great movie and i swear it!
2,I hate DVD's,"I'm giving a low score in protest to the all the DVD features that aren't included in the VHS format, not the movie itself. (I love the movie.)I know everything couldn't have been included but they could have put the deleted scenes in the VHS. That's what the did with the latter editons of the first Austin Powers movie. They could have included the Myers interview or a music video too.This is just the powers that be finding a way to force us to by DVDs. They don't want to go bust like they did with lazerdiscs."
1,Does Not Play on PC,"I don't know how I would rate the movie itself, since it won't work on my Compaq PC. It crashes everytime I hit play. If you only have a DVD player on your PC, do not buy this DVD."
5,a top film better than the first,"Austin Power the spy who shagged me is one of the best films that i have seen in a long time. ""Shagged"" is beter than the first i thought with better jokes that are a much funnier and a better plot,i recomend this film to everybody."
4,So ugly it's cute,"This is a terribly funny movie if you watch it with the right attitude. This movie is not for snobs who have to over-analyze everything. It's definitely a 6th grade boy's locker room comedy. I would not let my children watch it, but as adults, with a sense of humor, it was extremely funny. I have never been a Mike Myers fan but this movie along with the first one has changed my mind. If you have hang-ups about the mention of sex, skip this movie."
1,PEOPLE TODAY REALLY SCARE ME!,"The first AUSTIN was hysterical and smart!This new one was very sad and horrible.All there was were the same jokes tht weren't even executed well....austin was extremely dull this time and didn't even have the same pizzazz...hell,it seemed mike myers even forgot how austin talks.smae with Evil!I know this movie was meant to be very funny,and everyone said it was better than the first,but after i got done watching it,I got chills down my spine.......I didn't laugh even once through the film and it scares me that people think this is the funniest movie ever...wwaaaaaahht? This movie is probably on the many small things that you think nothing about,a small measure for the government to brainwash""If you don't believe me,stop watching tv and movies for a while....only read the paper every other day and you will start to see what I mean!Oh did i mention this movie is not funny?lol wake up people!"
3,Not as good as the 1st movie,"You have to be in the right mood to enjoy this movie. I had fun watching it but in the end, I felt that there should have been more compared to the first movie. There wasn't anything in this one to really make it more memorable."
1,The Movie is like Mini Me,"The movie itself is like Mini Me. Spy who Shagged me is the EXACT same as the first movie, but about 1/8 as funny. I mean come on this whole movie looks improvised and it is the same old stuff. You will end up with the same taste in your mouth if you just buy a little talking Austin Doll or something. Cuz all he does is spout catchphrases. Geez. Hopefully the next one will GO somewhere."
3,The charm has worn off this franchise,"While not a bad movie, the second installment in what is now sure to be the Austin Powers franchise is lacking when compared to the first. While Myers is able to recreate some of the magic from the first film, much of the humor is a retread of the first or just doesn't have the same punch of the original. The inclusion of Heather Graham's character into the series was perhaps the biggest mistake made by Myers. While in the original, Hurley's character provided a straight girl to offset Myers' outlandish character, the Graham character is even sillier than Myers. This is just too much to swallow even for a fan of the original.Overall, not a poor effort, but it retreads much of the same territory from the original and the jokes have gotten stale. Rent it first even if you loved the original as I did."
5,Lots of Fun!,This spoof on Secret agents and the 60's is a lot of fun. This movie should be watched for its comedy and soundtrack. Actually a sequel that is good.... Follows the same randy vein as the first movie.
1,Austin Powers: The goof who bored me!,"Were it not for the great music and the attractive female stars, this film would be completely unbearable. Whether it is intended to be a comedy, a satire, it doesn't matter, it is complete and utter c**p. I never expected a class actor as Tim Robbins to perform (be present) in a piece of garbage like this. A complete waste of time and money. Buy the great soundtrack instead. The 1 star rating is actually too much for this movie (if you can call it a movie)."
2,The DVD who shagged my wallet,"This overrated comedy is a mediocre attempt to make a parody of a James Bond moovie the moovie is outright boring the story and the dialogs too childish. However the moovie merits from one of the best scores I've heard in moovies for a long while and the DVD edition especially is a showcase of this medium capabilities. This edition benefits from Dolby digital sound and extras like the video clips of three songs from the moovie's score , notable among them the super hit ""Beautiful Stranger"" by Madonna. Apart from that there is a documentary a feature length commentary and the cinema trailers. All in all if you are in for extras this DVD does it for you interactive menu and deleted scenes included but if your interest is more substantial, this moovie is really nothing to be remembered and you will barelly watch it more than once unless of course you are a Heather Graham fan !"
5,Wheeeeeeeee!,"Austin is really cool, but I think that Wayne is a better character. Doctor Evil sounds a lot like Lorne Micheals and also Don Roritor( the pharmaceautical boss in the Kids in the Hall Movie) *played by Mark McKinney* Overall, this movie was really great."
1,DVD widescreen only stinks,This is a really funny movie but does not offer the choice of switching to a full tv screen. With all the extras packed in they should have included a full screen or pan scan version. WIDESCREEN ONLY DVD's STINK!
2,"The Original, Recycled","This movie really is funny. It's just as funny as the first. The reason I rated this movie so low however, is that the reason this movie is just as good as the first is because most of the jokes were IN the first one. Mustafa slowly dying, Dr. Evil telling Scott to ""Zip it"" (Shh! in the original), it's all the same. Then they got rid of Vannesa horribly, trying to pass her off as a Fembot which essentially destroys the first movie (why would they want to get rid of her anyway, I mean, she is FINE!). Taking away Austin's ""mojo"" leaves him a lifeless character which makes every scene he's in seem to D-R-A-G on forever. Everything that was good about the first movie is lost (except of course for the recycled jokes all through the movie). Had I seen this movie without ever seeing the first, it would have been OK, but between the lifeless Austin, the absence of Vannesa, and the re-used jokes this movie is utterly horrible."
3,"Good film, but missing some...","I really thought that this movie was really funny, just as funny of the first one. I would have given this movie four stars, except for the plot hole at the beginning when it was said that Venessa was always a Fem-bot. They didn't continue with why, but it makes the audience wonder if her parents were also fem-bots.This movie is still really funny, but some of the scenes almost made me sick, which made it lose another star. I don't want to give anymore spoilers, so I'll just say that you should see this movie for yourself to decide whether you like it or not."
1,The video that shagged me,"I could not conceive of the circumstances for which I would spend actual money on this video. I rented it recently and found the humor mindless, in the same vain as dumb and dumber. I realize that lots of American rave about this kind of humor, but it frankly stumps me to consider the level of sophistocation in this kind of production...Oh, look a geeky guy gets a beautiful girl by acting like and idiot..that slays me. Don't waste your money, even if it is just curiosity that drives you."
5,"Mike Myers:Crazy baby, yeah!","I knew after the enormously popular original, Mike would have to create a sequel, and this is just one more movie that demonstrates his comical genius. The flick was great, and his ""Dr. Evil"" is the funniest villian ever. I realy hopes he continues this hilarious saga."
2,Re-rent the first instead of this,The first Austin Powers was so much better. This is just not funny. It drags and nearly all of the humor is replicated from the first Austin Powers. The humor is more base and low-brow as well. Just not very clever. The DVD production is quite good though. Somehow I managed to see it a second time and I dislike it even more.
4,austin powers: the spy who shag me,it was funny and offence. i really did like it. the names used in the movie were very creative.
4,"Good Movie, but...","The movie was pretty good. The cast was great, except for Mike Myers as Austin Powers and the fat guy. The rest of the cast, and his other character Dr. Evil were hilarious. I personally think, overall, this is better than the first one."
5,I'll make it simple for you ...,"...if my house was on fire, this would be the CD I'd grab on my way out the door. It's that good."
5,have a concert in your living room!,"There are lots of live cuts and discs from lots of artists, but they're typically not the same as being at a concert. Most discs just let you hear the lesser quality than studio sound... and a few wolf whistles, and that's it... but this 2-disc set shines above the rest.If you close your eyes, you'll think you're at an outdoor concert. You can hear the members of the audience singing along and the sound of the acoustic guitars and the voices in harmony is fabulous.Previously unavailable tracks (except through bootleg circles) such as ""Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee"" will blow you away with the depth of the meaning of the lyrics and the picture painted with the words. Single classics such as ""Closer to Fine,"" ""The Power of Two"" and ""Galileo"" are also presented as live cuts. Whether you've been a fan for the past 10+ years or if you just recently started hearing tracks from the girls, you won't be disappointed in this fun, melodic and rockin' live set."
4,A nice representation,"1200 Curfews is a nice representation of the Indigos, but the chosen covers are hit and miss. While Emily Saliers gives a heart-filled reading of Joni Mitchell's great ""River"", she and Amy Ray misfire on their bloated take of Dylan's ""Tangled Up In Blue."" ""Midnight Train To Georgia"" also feels unnatural as well, and I also agree that one ""Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee"" is enough.The original material sparkles, particularly the stripped-down version of ""Ghost"", the FM radio broadcast of ""Power Of Two"" and the anthemic ""Strange Fire."" Nonetheless, this could have been stripped down to a 78-minute, 5-star CD."
5,One of the best albums ever recorded,"I'm a pretty discerning music fan, but this one I love. Awesome renditions of ""Galileo,"" ""Land of Cannan,"" and ""World Falls."" Also includes some cool covers, especially ""Tangled Up in Blue"" and ""Midnight Train to Georgia."" Includes some really early stuff, like ""Back Together Again,"" which was recorded in a basement in 1983. Cool bonus track at the end of the second disk (a solo of the rock-out ""Touch Me Fall""). A few songs seem too long and dragged out, such as ""Dead Man's Hill,"" and do we really need two versions of ""Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee""? Even still, this album rocks. Recommendation: a must for any folk-rock fan."
5,You Feel Like You're There!!!!,"I put on the CD and kept thinking I was at the concert! The energy they exude is amazing, and this is a collection of the Indigo Girls at their best! This is a favorite because it brings so many of their best songs, and their best covers, all together in two CDs.My favorite is ""Tangled Up In Blue""...it blows Bob Dylan right out of the picture! Emily's sweet and sudden raw spin on the song is very good, and Amy is icing on the cake!A must have for any Indigo Girls fan...and great if you're just starting to like them!!"
5,"Wonderful, stirring, powerful music....",This music is so provocative. It moves me to new emotional depths
5,Great CD,"This CD has so many of the Indigo Girls best music. If you only have one CD of thiers, it should be this one."
4,"Ireland, beautiful and human","I am a great fan of Frank McCourt, he has lit the fire in me to read again. Although his contribution to this book is little more than a foreword, it is Ireland through his eyes, and through the eyes of the people who adore it.The images are amazing, from the quiet fields to the pubs, it shows Ireland in all it's lush culture. It is a book that photographers can admire, and people of Irish descent can hold close to their hearts. Although it is expensive (its only downfall), it is more than worth buying, to sit on a coffee table. Where it will never gather dust, because you will always crack it open to see a favorite picture."
5,Mandatory Reading,"As a package, though written many years apart, these two texts provide formidble testament of the human spirit; man reduced in appalling circumstances, and perchance surviving as witness of them. For all the dour grittiness of life under the Nazis, the most impressive realisations, for me, come at the beginning of their evacuation from the camps in the first chapter, 'The Thaw' of,'The Truce' as the Russians arrive to liberate them. The few survivors have the awesome task of reigniting their diminished humanity. In describing this process, Levi is unchallenged as a writer and thinker.The prose takes a more expansive mode without ever losing its grip. Not a word wasted; the pitch, tone perfect. Horrifying, but never numbing, these essential pages should never go out of print. Read them and tell your friends they must also."
5,wonderful book,"This book grabs you from the moment you start to read. It is so sad that this time in history occurred & that human's were treated in this fashion. It is almost unbelievable. It is so sad for me to read these books but I find it so educational to hear it from someone who withstood these horrors & lived to tell about them. This authors writting is great & I cannot wait to read his other books, I have ordered all his books & am sorry to hear of his passing. We have lost a great person, I hope after his release from the Germans hell on earth that he enjoyed his life."
3,"Powerful, despite poor translation.","The translator seems to have improved his skills by the time he got to ""The Truce,"" but even with the uneven translation, reading Primo Levi's first-person, two-part account of surviving the concentration camps and the chaos of survivors and refugees in Europe afterward is a powerful way to view the World War II Jewish experience."
3,Questionable song selections,"Lulu is in excellent voice, and this is one of the few stereo recordings from her during that era. Nonetheless, many of the songs are not commensurate with her abilities, making this CD less than it should have been. For true fans, only."
1,Really Bad,"I bought this game a few years ago, when it first came out. It was SO BAD and it still is. I have to admit, i saw the commercials on tv and the game looked pretty cool, kinda like turok, but it isnt. The controls are horrible, making it impossible to shoot accurately. The graphics are too fuzzy and dark, making it extremely hard to see ememies. There is really no story to why you are running around shooting bugs. Its really sad, you can tell acclaim got the idea for this game when starship troopers was out in the theaters, and rushed to get it out as quick as possible. If you want a first person shooter, get goldeneye, perfect dark, any quake, or any fps that was a hit on the pc that was ported to n64"
2,Just another 1st person shooter,"Armorines is a game that we have all played before. If you have played Turok, Quake, Doom, etc. then you have played this game. Not only that, the levels are short, there are very few weapons and the control options are bizarre and take some time to get used to (pushing left/right on the control stick causes you to strafe in that direction, not turn! ). Aiming and performing delicate maneuvers is a chore and the environments look like cardboard cutouts. The sound is nothing extraordinary. Acclaim should have taken a look at Medal of Honor and applied the same detail to a game that had potential, but ended up as a mediocre shooter. This game is boring."
3,"Interesting, not reviting....","There is no actual plot to speak of since this is a simple account of a prairie woman's coming into young adulthood. It is interesting for those who wonder about small town and rural life in the earlier decades of the 20th century, particulary as different European heritages were still affecting community cultures in our country."
3,Praire Bloomin,I was reading someone's Diary. Very repetitious after a few chapters .I am not sure if I will order the third one if it is like this one/
5,Early life on the prairie,I loved this account of life on the prairie. The format was entertaing. Definitey depicted a hard life plus historical events.
2,this is a joke right?,$14.99 for a video you can watch for free on YouTube From muppetstudios? Am I missing something? I love the muppets but this pricing is stupid.
1,Even with relatively low expectations...,"...based on other Amazon reviews, I went ahead and bought this. And even my low expectations weren't met! I appreciate that the producers thought the whole ""marriage market"" angle would provide oomph. Instead, however, it simply interfered with the audience learning what we might have about the life and times of these people.Give us more insight into the freedoms and limitations of the times, of the intricacies, the passions, the boredom of the day-to-day routines. Give us more on the insights the modern-day people are gaining. Give us follow-up on how this experience impacted their perspectives on today.Give us less of the trumped-up romances... no voiceover could have made them interesting!"
3,The hostess is unbelievably annoying,"I am not sure why she was chosen - maybe a friend of someone, but she spoiled the whole ""party""-her ego was so overpowering and she was so oversentive, that I have a strong suspicion she is a long time alcoholic. The reason why I was able to finish watching was because I was interested to find out more about life in those times, and I loved the host-he was very balanced and tried to do his best to keep peace. I learned to fast forward the parts with her face in it.Anyway, the show itself does give you quite a bit of details from life in regency life, intersperced with ""reality""stuff. So if you have patience or enjoy ""reality""part, then go for it."
2,Could not see the point,"I passionately love history, particularly British history, and I really looked forward to viewing this show. I have to say, though, that I am disappointed and was very bored watching these people try to look like they were living in a different age. They were, for the most part, very unappealing, and while I love ""Pride and Prejudice"", and Jane Austen's other works, they were fiction. I guess I just found the jump back and forth between centuries too much to empathize with as I did not care at all who these people married, who they bedded, how much wine they drank, etc or what century they were pretending to live in. But I will give the concept an ""E"" for effort and realize that I am in the minority - in this case, anyway."
2,Very weak entry in the PBS House series,"The brilliant idea behind the House series is to take ""reality"" television into a new sphere. The two I saw before this, Manor House and 1940 House, were wildly entertaining as well as full of sociological and cultural insights.Unfortunately, Regency House Party trashes the concept. It is little more than ""Big Brother"" in period dress. Essentially, they've just brought a group of rather uninteresting people into a matchmaking situation. The setting and costumes seem nothing more than trimmings, and the cultural lessons are abruptly inserted at regular intervals.All that would be acceptable if it resulted in some form of entertainment, but it does not. Almost all the participants seem bored to tears as they're put through their paces, and the viewer is left with nothing. What little drama there is seems artificially created in the editing room.I suggest you pass by the door of this House and move on to the next."
2,Why don't they put subtitles on these shows?,"We were frustrated with trying to understand what these people were saying. Who can understand the British accents? We had difficulty with the speech of some of the participants. They were difficult to understand at times. It drove us to distraction. We had to play certain parts more than once, because we kept asking each other just exactly what was said."
1,Revisionist History,"I was very excited when I saw this disc in the store because I had always loved Paul's version of Love Is Blue. I had worn out at least a dozen copies of the Phillips 45 over the years. However, when I got this disc home, I learned that the version of Love Is Blue that is on it is NOT the same one that got all the air play and was a hit. It's a very different mix, possibly a different performance. The horns and strings are very wrong, not at all what was on the original ""hit"", and the drumming isn't what was on the original either.If there's a version of Paul Mauriat's ""HIT"" Love Is Blue on CD, this isn't it."
1,NOT Original Version of Love is Blue...,"Just based on listening to the sample available here, I can see that ""Love is Blue"" is NOT the original version I grew to like in the late 60s. Why does it have to be so hard to find true originals of songs from the 60s and early 70s? I too have it on a 45, but it's old and worn and doesn't sound too good anymore; I was hoping to find the original tune on a CD. Maybe someone will make an MP3 of it...."
1,Don't buy this book,"Key words: Obscure, vague and unfocused.Even simple ideas and concepts are presented in an unfocused, hand-waving style. The (vague) signal has a hard time penetrating the noise.The few things the authors have to say has already been said before and better by other authors."
3,Could be better,"As has been pointed out in other reviews, the book rambles. In the process, it reveals a chaos magick ritual designed to make a foolish man look foolish. Quite an accomplishment of magickal technqiue. If it didn't tend toward such sillyness it might more worthwhile. The endorsement of a bastardized Nietzschean concept of the superman is childishly pointless. Why should a psychopath want to influence the development of humanity? ""Toxick Magick"", or whatever cute name he wants to apply, is irrelevant and a waste of time.The book has some interesting moments, but is overall not impressive at all."
2,Hollow Shell,"I expected a whole lot more, but I guess that was my first mistake. My second was buying it. Actually the core message, if you can gleen it from the wandering and jumping prose, is somewhat profound. However, the way it's presented doesn't at all match the way it's packaged. If you're interested, buy it used or borrow it!"
4,Have not read the book yet,how much is this book really? There aren't any new ones just used ones and it says it starts at 82 dollars!! what the F!
2,Just doesn't do the job well enough.,"I got 10 of these with my Medtronic CGM and, beside being too small, they start to lift in a very short time making them totally innefective for what they're intended, to keep my CGM dry. I used 2 this morning when I changed my sensor and they both came loose before I left the house for work.Luckily I have a friend who wanted Bioclusive dressings and asked me to order her some at which time I accidentally ordered 2 boxes. Since she could only afford 1, I kept one. I'm glad I did now. Much better product if you can find and afford it."
2,Sensor covers,This product seems to be adequate but I expected more pieces. They are pretty pricey but that may be the cost of being a diabetic.
4,"Cool, but a little too slick","Like their North American counterparts, the artists performing on Brazilian MTV feel free to take a wide latitude with the concept of the ""acoustic"" show; in rock-soul legend Jorge Ben's case, he brings a full-on Barry White-style string section and soul orchestra onto the soundstage with him, creating a fairly gigantic sound. These sleek presentations of his greatest career hits are a little too reserved for me -- it's professional and grandly realized, but lacks any element of danger or chance, more a glorified nostalgia tour than an artistic effort. Still, these arrangements do sound a lot different than the original sambadelic funk recordings of the '60s and '70s, and it's kind of interesting to hear him re-imagine his own work in this manner. I'm not sure, but I'd guess that the concert DVD is probably more interesting to watch than the CDs are to listen to."
5,This is the way to live!,I read this book at the advice of my father and I'm thankful he did. You'll want to be a beat. You'll want to hitch-hick and travel around with Sal and Dean and just watch the world roll under the tires and you will disown any sensible thoughts you had about your future and make plans to cross the country- Jack Kerouac style. This book is worth it!
4,The twine...,"wound with beat, Kesey, passion, Wolfe, adventure, Burroughs and self-exploration. Read between Naked Lunch and The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, this was the perfect book for me to read at the time. The characters and base influences reappear throughout each of these three books. Not the ""greatest book I have ever read"", as many of you say, but I did really enjoy it. There is a relaxed and mystical feel to Kerouac's descriptions and lyric writing that is unique. This style may be compared to Steinbeck's first three pages in Of Mice and Men, but there is no other Kerouac. However, I may have to read it again now knowing that Kerouac may not have been as ""beat"" as we all thought (the recently published The Long, Slow Death of Jack Kerouac, I believe that is the title). If you do read Wolfe's book (The Electric...), remember... Neal Cassidy is Dean."
2,It was not as good as I thought it was going to be.,"I had heard a lot about Kerouac as a writer, and I think maybe my expectations were too high. I did not like it as much as I thought I would. The book seemed pointless and never ending. I thought some of the experiences the main character had were interesting, yet became boring after a while."
4,Good read,"A good read. I'm working my way through the top 100 modern classics list from the Modern Library Editorial Review Board and this was no. 55. I have to say that as a whole, the beatnik generation really paints a rather abstract picture in its impact on modern literature. I can see the link to Faulkner in some of Kerouac's writing, though perhaps more so in his later writings than in ""On the Road"". Philosophically, the book is somewhat shallow. It's greatest strength really lies in its ability to reach people of all walks of life on some level. I think we can all relate to the desire to explore our world and our culture and certainly our role in it all to see where the reality of our perspective meets with our expectations created by that perspective. I can't say that the beatnik generation really had an amazing impact on our culture, but it did effect the way we all see things. To that end, it's a very worthwhile read."
3,There's Better Kerouac Out There,"Probably the biggest mistake was made by the editor, who insisted that Kerouac have punctuation and paragraphs. This work shouldn't have either. It should come out just as it did originally from Jack's typewriter - as one long scream. But what gets this book only three stars is the fact that the main character, Dean Moriarty, is neither particularly likable nor particularly funny. To put up with that for the entire length of a book takes a lot of patience. Good luck. There is an interesting sidelight, and that is the juxtaposition of cool and hot, the characters of Sal Paradise (the narrator) and Dean. They are like Miles Davis and Charlie Parker, an unsettling union indeed. The book IS a good journey into the Zeitgeist of the Beatnik Age. What's the better Kerouac referred to in my headline? Try ""Dharma Bums"" or ""Big Sur."""
4,Legend and Truth a little different,"I just read the book for the first time. I didn't find the characters the type I would like to emulate, too much alcohol and destructive behavior. Destructive behavior to yourself is bad, to others, well that's nothing to be emulated. The legend that it was written in one three week period is just that, a legend. Kerouac worked on it for years. Read this article from the NY times, I found it interesting.August 22, 2001 New York Public Library Buys Kerouac Archive By THE NEW YORK TIMES"
5,It's More Than Just Typing,"As a mystery author with my debut novel in its initial release, I am a sincere admirer of ON THE ROAD, as well as Jack Kerouac's works in general. While it was once said that Mr. Kerouac's work was not writing--it was typing--that statement does not give ON THE ROAD and Mr. Kerouac fair shakes. This book and his works defined the Beat Movement. They captured a sense of an entire generation. They have had a major impact on American letters and intellectual thought. ON THE ROAD should be read by every person who wants to consider herself a well-read individual."
5,the definitive novel of the Beat generation,"What can you say about this classic novel that hasn't already been said? Kerouac's ""On The Road"" stands with Ginsberg's ""Howl"" and Burroughs' ""Naked Lunch"" to form the the trio of literary works that defined the generation that changed America and her writers forever."
3,"Good, But hard to relate to","Overall this is a great book, and it brings alot of perspective of how things where during the beat generation. The only trouble I had was following the characters. It is a great book to read, and I think it is a must for everyone to read or try to read at least once."
5,So that is what the fuss is about,"Oftentimes I've heard so much about a writer's amazing talent only to be disappointed when I get around to reading his/her work. Ayn Rand falls into this category to a degree and Bukowski falls all the way into it--but not Kerouac.I don't know if Jack captured the heartbeat of a generation. I don't know if Jack motivated even one person to actually get ""on the road"". I do know that this is a book written with the skill of a master storyteller. Jack didn't try to convince you of anything--the philosophy contained in On the Road was haphazard and disjointed. What he did was simply tell a story that reads like prose poetry--or maybe it reads like jazz put to words. Simply put, it is just a joy to read this novel because it tells a story in a way that draws you in and lets you live it as well.You may never actually get in your car and drive to the end of the road but this is the next best thing."
3,"Great Stories, Flawed Book","""Let's just drive. Maybe we ought to go back, though?"" That sums up Jack Kerouac's On the Road. The characters travel just for the sake of gaining new experiences while they are fully aware that their lifestyles will not advance them economically or socially. Sal and Dean, the main characters, go on wild road trips, do drugs and have sex with many women. At first it is fun to read of their adventures but it is definitely not worth 300 or so pages. There is no real plot holding together the tales of drugs and driving so it is hard to motivate yourself to continue with the book. One might argue that this is the best format because it matches the Beat lifestyles, unguided and spontanious, but even if that is the case books are not supposed to be burdensome to read. Jack Kerouac has amazing stories to tell but I wish he could have consolidated the book a bit or given his format more thought because it is not the most compelling thing to read."
3,Lonely Thoughts and Be-bop Jazz,"America has changed since Sal and Dean first set out way back in the 1940's. Paved fifty times over in many places. But perhaps that's what makes the book so intriguing; there will always be people who feel compelled to take off down those same roads, the same way, taking those same turns in neutral. Back then, with Kerouac's writing there came a new language that played alongside a new music and a new way of living. But our natural response to run from anxiety, responsibility, and fear is nothing new. Who has never felt compelled to crawl out their window when the walls begin to squeeze? Who has never felt the urge to escape?If you read this book hoping for a well wrought story, you might be disappointed. The writing won't take you down adventurous new turns and twists of plot either. But I don't think it's supposed to.This book will take you to familiar places."
3,A statement of life,"A few have been critical of On the Road for the absence of a point. Devotees have responded by saying that that criticism misses the point precisely. My advice would be to look for the cumulative effect. Compared with great literature On the Road is lacking, but it was not intended to be. Rather, examine On the Road as a slice of life. Ideally, your experience reading On the Road would be life-changing, but each of us is at different stages of life and therefore, we cannot experience it uniformly. Everyone should read Kerouac, to get a glimpse of history and maybe to understand a generation, another time. Recommended for anyone high school and up."
5,Nobody is as honest as Jack Kerouac,"In High School, one of my teachers told me that I should be a writer. ""But I don't know about characterization, plot development"" and all of those other dry writer things I cried. Well, Kerouac changed all that for me. My perceptions of what writing is, what fiction is, what the purpose of writing is, and perhaps the meaning of life was completely changed. Obliterated by this one man. Beethoven wrote ""there is nothing higher than to approach the Godhead more nearly than other mortals and by means of that contact to spread the rays of the Godhead through the human race."" Kerouac approached the Godhead so closely, and distributed those rays so perfectly that even the laws of grammar bent themselves to his will. If you do not read this book, you will never understand why Bob Dylan said ""I read On the Road... It changed my life like it changed everyone else's"""
4,title,"""original scroll"" in the title is a bit misleading, as this is the actual edited, published manuscript.this seems to be an error on the kindle edition."
5,"nice gift, wish i got it","i bought this as a gift for a friend. i have read on the road, and it was an amazing story, i didn't read this edition though. my friend thought it was super cool, and is now taking it with him this summer during hikes."
4,On the Road,"Great book!! One qualifier: if you have never fed your sense of adventure, done drugs, or enjoyed illicit sex occasionally, then you may find On the Road a little hard to understand or identify with."
2,Slow Going So Far,"I have yet to finish this book, but its been slow going so far. I always finish what I start, however. Hopefully it will pick up soon!"
3,Inconsistent,"I am not quite done with the book but I am disappointed. The writer is well known and praised. While parts of this are interesting, he seems to lapse into long sentences describing things that I personally cannot relate to. For example, going on and on about the beat of the music in various jazz bars. All well and good but music needs to be experienced, not read. Also, I still don't see his point. I will wait to the end. I still won't rate it much higher since I have been waiting for it to take off and it has so far failed to live up to the hype."
2,I just didn't dig it,"I just finished this book so my opinion is fresh and thoughtful. I did not like it. By the last chapter of the book, I had traveled with Sal Paradise (the main character) from the East side of America to the West side of America about five times. Very tiring!! The book was extremely naive. It had no depth. Kerouac's definition of ""beat"" seemed to be sex and alcohol and apathy. I don't understand how people can live in dream land all their life, and tune out reality-- tune out the poverty and racism and corruption of the world around them, especially when they are SEEING IT. The characters visited Mexico and all they seemed to notice was jungle and [prostitutes]. A tad shallow. The whole book described Sal and Dean's life as a joke; time to play and not worry about anything cause they ""know time"" and they can ""dig"" it.On the Road, if you're reading Kerouac for the first time, may disappoint you. Be wary."
3,A must read for its historic importance and writing style,"I liked and disliked this book. There is no real plot or storyline. It's more of an anecdotal conversation. While reading the book, I felt as if I were reading a long letter that Kerouac (or Sal) had written to me. As far as being an enjoyable work of literature, it just didn't do anything for me. But On the Road gained my respect as a piece of art. Kerouac's writing style is nothing less than emotion come to life. At times it is hard to follow because of the harried and scattered development. But that is exactly the feeling that Kerouac was trying to get us to understand. The wild and sweaty underground jazz halls, the half-remebered half-spaced out road trips, the crazy relationships. All of it is infused with ""beat"". So, although I'm not sure if you will enjoy the book, you should read it because of its embodiment of the rebellion of the fifties and its influence on modern times."
3,Not what I expected,This book is touted as a book that defined a generation. It's hard to understand how that could be the case. Certainly this book didn't romanticize life on the road. The characters are complex but not particularly likeable and their approach to life is not laudable or enviable.
4,An excellent performance of a childish novel,"I dislike the prose Beats; I *hate* Burroughs, while I only dislike Kerouac, but nonetheless I agree with John Updike's very funny parody of the genre called ""On The Sidewalk"" (from his 1965 book Assorted Prose), in which the narrator is a faux-rebellious child who takes off burning through the afternoon on his tricycle, but is too scared to cross the street alone.But Matt Dillon's performance of this audiobook version is really excellent. He does absorbing but not overdone voices for the different characters, reads the rest of the time with a suitable world-weary tone, and (my favorite aspect of his performance) picks up on the fact that Kerouac sometimes goes on a tear of short, Hemingway-esque sentences, which Dillon reads as if they were liturgy or poetry, with a steady, incantatory beat.There seems to be a trend of recruiting name actors to do high-profile audiobooks; Maggie Gyllenhall's The Bell Jar is even better."
2,The book is absolutely amazing but the narration is not,"If you want to hear this book read you need to track down the version narrated by Frank Muller. He gives the characters life, the way he voices Dean is so perfect. Dillon is cool in movies but he is so flat on this CD. It is really unfortunate because I wanted to hear this amazing book from a different angle but honestly I couldn't even get through it. Find the Muller version and you will be in love it captures the whole wild, jazzy, vibrant story that Kerouac wrote 50 years ago."
1,Stay Away from Kindle Edition: Typographical Errors,"The kindle edition of On The Road is riddled with typographical errors that make it very difficult to read. Periods and other punctuation appearing in the middle of sentences being one of the worst. Misspellings and random capitalization are among others. If it were one or two of these it wouldn't matter, but in some chapters it is one or more per page.When you are reading along! and suddenly The sentence ends, you have know idea. What it means until you reread it and figure out it was a typographical error.I wish I'd bought a paperback copy. I would have been much happier.I enjoyed the book itself after stumbling through the horribly digitized transcribed text. It has historical and cultural significance, but I'm embarrassed to have spent money on this edition.3-stars for On The Road in general. Don't buy the Kindle edition; get a paperback copy instead.Amazon should be pressuring it's publishers to have quality products."
1,Pointless,"I read this book because it was on the ""100 Greatest Novels of All Time"" list. I've read about half of the books on list and BY FAR this is the most disappointing book on there. I realize the book was essentually about the mood and not so much about the plot, but I didn't like the mood, the small plot, the characters, the writing style, or anything else about the book."
3,Best if read in a weekend.,"If your style of reading is slower, aka you read about 10-20 pages on your way to work and 10-20 pages before going to bed, it's a tough book to follow and stay excited about. If you read quickly this is a fun read that allows you to explore the friendship and lives of two of the most interesting characters youll meet.Great book... but depends on your reading style!"
2,Interesting as historical artifact,"I guess this was an interesting book at the time. Today everything is available to today's youth in mainstream society - drugs, friendship with ""benefits"", cynicism, underground communities on the internet. So the newness of non-confirmism has been absorbed and is readily available. In fact, it's hard not to read this book without seeing all the societal and personal consequences - AIDS, the devastation of divorce on children, deadbeat dads, drunk driving accidents, hippy sellouts. Dean takes a chance at 110 mph - woo-hoo, am I supposed to be impressed?Interesting as a template for 20th century wild living, but I found this hard to read as anything other than youthful stupidity - not to be admired or followed."
3,OK read,"I found this to be a fairly boring story, but it is well written. Perhaps my expectations were just too high, after all the praise around it. Still glad I read it."
2,"Couldn't dig it, man","Maybe it's because I've never had ties to, or came of age after, the Beat Generation, but this book was a struggle for the most part. Sal's description of their trek through Mexico, though, was wonderful. For the first time, I have a genuine desire to visit New Mexico. Sal is the only character I like, but I cannot comprehend his affinity for Dean M. Is it just me, or does anyone else think of Cosmo Kramer? I'm wondering whether Michael Richards read this book and based his characterization on Dean's ludicrous and offbeat antics. No doubt, this is a ""wild and crazy"" read that will satisfy a certain segment of the population who don't require a plot and who dig a rambling literary style."
3,"How to ""stick it to the man""","Few have laid down a record of rebellious thought and attitude like Mr. Kerouac's classic train-of-thought travel log. It set not only newtrends in the style of writing for later generations, but taught them how to live out lives that ""stick it to the man"" in some of the most self-destructive behavior imaginable. Yes, you read that right, self-destructive; as king Solomon observed, there is truly nothing new under the sun. Nothing seems to stick it to the man like self-destruction and with respect to that, Mr. Kerouac really gave us nothing new. Still, this classic was, in a very real sense, a great catalyst to the movements that gave us our pop culture of today. To understand American culture of the late 20th and early 21st century, one must start with Kerouac. His work is important and a fun read but not a great role model as some seem to have believed."
1,Harmful to women.....and men,"The most admired character in the book, Dean, uses and abuses women for his sexual needs, including young girls. This book glamorizes the use of drugs (marijuana) and underage prostitution. If you like books that reinforce the idea that women should be used for sexual gratification and otherwise are not worth spending time on, this one's for you."
1,Luckily I was never forced to read this book...,"...as part of any class. Unfortunately, I decided I to attempt to read it on my own since it's allegedly an American classic. Somewhere around page 50, I decided to get out of the car and walk back to New York. I'll skip this road trip. Thanks anyway."
3,An Alright book,"Ok well I think that this book was an alright book. I thought it was uniquely written, and put together. But I also think that everyone makes it seem like its this unbelievable perfect book that everyone's got to love. I think that it is an ok book to read if you want to read about the beat lifestyle or if it assigned to you at school. I had to read this book due to it being assigned to me in my high school senior English class. I really liked it at first but then I started to not like it at all. So that's another reason why I think the book is just ""ok"". I guess I would like this book better if it was like the late forties early fifties and I was part of the ""beat"" generation. But its not and I'm not, so in the long run this book was really boring to me."
1,The book's great but don't take Matt Dillon's word for it...,"If you have enjoyed this book and are looking for an audio version for yourself or a gift I would recommend the Recorded Books edition of On The Road performed by Frank Muller (ISBN 0788726005) versus the Harper's read by Matt Dillon (ISBN 0694523607). I have listened to both these and Muller surpasses Dillon's enthusiasm tenfold. I'm afraid Dillon was chosen more for the business idea that a pop icon reading Kerouac equals higher sales rather then adept narration. Dillon's attempt on the masterpiece is so vapid it's hard to fathom listening to hour after hour of it. Muller on the other hand is quite the opposite. He brings the characters to life with narrative ardor. He takes the listener with him on the great Kerouac journey. Muller draws you into the homily with sublime storytelling skill and you find yourself amongst Sal, Dean, and all the others along for the ride...."
1,Sal Paradise and Dean?,"I put my rating as a 1 only to get some attension. Most people say the same thing about this wonderful novel so, I want people to hear about what Sal and Dean represent. They are the people that we struggle to be, and they live their lives with the passion we all strive for. They're what people have to learn to be like and accept. Life ""on the road"" is a choice and sometimes we must substitute that road for our own passing. In the end we don't want to be left looking back from a rear view mirror, watching our best friends walking away, alone. Sal's lesson on ""the only people for me are the mad ones..."" transpires through the search which I too have been desperately awaiting. If Kerouac was still alive today, I would hope that he would be somewhere in Denver looking for (""Dean"") Neal Cassidy, and sipping the best wiskey from the back of an old Ford."
1,A Rambling Bore,"This book went on & on & on. OK, so Sal went on the road, then Sal, Dean and others went on the road. There was a lot of drinking and hitchhiking, and a lot of ridiculous ramblings by Dean. Go talk to some idiot on drugs and you'll hear the same thing. I had hoped for so much more but was greatly disappointed by this book - I could pace the floor of a 7-Eleven and get more enjoyment than I got out of this flimsy road-story. There were times when Kerouac's words sounded quite literary and lovely but the times were too few."
1,I've got to agree with a few of the reviewers....,"I just dont see what the big deal about this one is. It is incredibly boring. I wanted to like it too. I tried to like it. But a ""lets hitch-hike around the U.S., get drunk, etc."" book just didnt end up doing it for me. And thats all this book really is. Back and forth across the U.S., same parties and stories over and over. I forced myself to get 2/3's of the way through before I gave up. There was nothing new in this book even when it was first published. Everyone knew about lovable losers and drifters and had for decades before this book was written."
3,mixed feelings,"I think the reason people like this book is because they envy the ability of Sal to live free and have no responsibility. These same people think that this is no longer possible and Sal was extremely daring and fortunate to take this oppurtunity. As long as you dont have kids, you can still live this type of lifestyle. I recently embarked alone on a cross country bike trip. Hitchhiking, sex, and drugs were all easily available to me on that trip. So it is still possible. Furthermore, Druggies are usually really stupid people but Sal was somewhat awake and intelligent. Not what I consider the greatest accomplishment. Keeping this book in perspective is hard but if you do, respect for Sal and his book go up somewhat. To conclude, if you've lived any type of freedom you won't enjoy this book as much as one who had a strict upbringing who feels the need to justify a 'free' lifestyle. Also, it seems that age greatly influences one's perception of the book, I am 18."
5,A Second Chance After 15 years,"When I was 26 years old I picked up On the Road and hated it. I don't remember a thing about it and I thought it was boring. Now 15 years later I'm rereading it and I think it is a must read for anyone who enjoys reading Faulkner or Carson McCullers. It's in their league. The book has simplicity, a true American voice and it's timeless. There is a freedom in his telling that excites me and that my being wants to cling to. To me the book presents a picture of an America that was - lives intersect at bus stations, crossroad bars, cotton fields and hitchiking. I love it!"
4,A good starting point,"This novel is a good first read to the uninitiated of the Kerouac writing style. It gives a sense of the energy that is conveyed in all of his writings. However, to get the true feel of Jack Kerouac this is only the beginning of the road. He has many other novels that were published un-edited which give a much truer sense of how he wanted to write, unfettered of style and rules. A good starting point for the new beat reader."
2,be honest,"I have tried, really I have tried. I have read On The Road when I was 21 and I have read On the Road when I was 41. I wanted to 'get it'. I really did. The sad fact is if you are really serious about this type of literature go the masters - go to Henry Miller, go to Pynchon's 'V', or even go to Hunter Thompson and you'll see what good writing really is.Ultimately, and I am sorry to disagree with a nation full of posers, this is the most overrated book of all time."
1,Boring and pointless,"As far as I can tell, this book is about girls, hitchhiking, and partying. After 100 pages and no plot in sight, I put the book down. A total waste of time."
5,A real gone read!,"I can't believe I reached 60 without reading this classic. It's everything I ever heard about it: wild, hip, beat, free, crazy, iconic...plus Jack Kerouac has a way of stringing words together that is right up there with Steinbeck and Hemingway. A wonderful picture of ""the beat generation"" and a very different view of America. Read it!"
5,Kerouac's Masterpiece,"This is by far Kerouac's best work. It details his adventures with Neil Cassiday in way only Kerouac could. This book defines the beat movement and defines, for me at least how the world was long before I was born. Being only 20 years old I cannot imagine hitch hiking across the country, in the present time that would not only be socially unacceptable but highly dangerous.However this book is a quick and fun read that you don't want to put down. Kerouac's writing style is great and original and cannot be matched."
5,The Classic Outlaw,"All I can say is that if you've read this book, you know how amazing it is... it is a classic after all! If you have not read this, go out buy it, read it, and find someone else who has not read it. It almost seems to be a book that created an underground cult. I LOVE it..."
4,It's Kerouac,"The story is great!Personally I don't like it when they change book covers to add movie photos. I prefer the original cover.It doesn't change what is inside, quality writing by an amazing author!"
2,Don't Understand the Hype,"Ive have tried reading this book several times, have gotten about two-thirds of the way through it, and can't understand why this is considered a literary classic by many readers."
2,Hit the road Jack and don't come back no more!,"Being into music and movies of the late 60's and early 70's I ofcourse had to read ""On the road"". I don't no why (too young, too old, too european, too single minded, not easy to please,...) but I didn't find what is supposed to be so good, great, fantastic about this book. It just bored me."
1,On the No-Fun Read,"I read this book in the 80's, back in the day when I had just discovered reading. I had high expectations. The book was part of a Contemporary Lit class, and I could not believe how boring it was. They would hitchhike, meet interesting characters, tell enough of the story to intrigue, and then they would move on, drinking, riding, and missing the big picture. The repitition, the blandness of what should have been an incredible journey, went on and on. Perhaps at the time it was written there was a little novelty. This book may be one of the most overrated of the 20th century."
5,A twentieth century American Classic,"When I first read this book 25 years ago it had a tremendous impact on my life . I sougtht to emulate Jack's adventures and found my own road. Looking back from the vantage point of middle age, having had the opportunity to have read countless books, I can truly say that none came close to being as influential as On The Road. His work influenced the generations that followed, yet barely knew him. In the context of his time, Jack's work was a fresh look at the American Spirit. It serves us today as reminder of that Spirit, of that America which is out there beyond what we see on TV or Cyberspace"
2,On the Road,"I honestly had no idea this was ""crib notes"" for the book. It took close to a month to get it, and I ended up having to go purchase the book anyhow. Even now I can't find anything that tells you it's crib notes! I guess I should know that ""MAXNotes literature guides"" isn't the publisher. My bad. Overall, between the shipping and the product my purchase was unsatisfactory to say the least."
2,Poor quality e-book,"I was largely disappointed with the amount of errors in the Kindle version of On the Road. When I'm paying for a book, I'd like to think it's been edited and I don't have to struggle over incorrect words and missing punctuation. When you see free e-books with these kind of errors, it's understandable. But if the publisher is going to make me pay almost the same amount for an electronic version of the book, then the electronic version should hold the same editorial integrity.I only wish I could get my money back, something that I would be able to do with a physical copy at a bookstore."
3,"interesting, overrated","If you want to re-read ""On the Road"" without the commas, paragraphs or chapter breaks, this book is for you. And if you buy into the myth of the manuscript as the author's authentic voice, read on. But I found most of the ""restorations"" to be overhyped. Naughty words are restored from the published version. We get real names. We learn that Allen Ginsberg is gay. And so?No one is going to compare this to Emily Dickinson's fascicles or the genetic text of Billy Budd.Buy it if you must. You know you want this book. Just don't expect any new insights."
2,not enough going on.,"There was a lot of ""we went here, and then we went there. We got there by hitchhiking.""That's pretty much all this book is. I wish i would have read a different book by Kerouac before this, because this book sort of turned me off to him."
1,ON THE ROAD,"no plot, no structure!!!WHAT's THE MAIN THEME!!!!!!?how do you write an essay on this!!!This book is terrible!!!!!"
2,Classic?,I heard this book was a classic but I thought it was rather boring and did not finish it which never happens.
1,Puh-leaze! Give me a break,"This book gets my nomination for the most overrated book in American Literature. It is trite, saccharine and false. The themes and insights it contains are not even good enough to be third rate. Moreover, as a prose stylist, Kerouac was probably fourth rate. In short, I despise this piece of [garbage] and would advise all of its hipster doofus fans to lose the tie-dye clothes and throw away their bongs. Maybe then they will read something good for a change."
2,A series of random thoughts is not literature,On The Road may just be the most overrated book of all time. Venture most of the raves found on this page and elsewhere are by those who liked it because they were supposed to like it.
1,For those who have not traveled and do not take chances.,"After having ""On the Road"" suggested to me by numerous friends and family i finally made time to read it. From Chapter 1 i found this novel boring and predictable. After some time (3/4's through the book) i realized this novel isn't written for me. It's written for anyone who either does not travel, doesn't have the balls to travel or doesn't take chances in everyday life. I can sort of see why this novel appeals to so many in my generation but i still have to say, spend a night drinking and bar hopping and your likely to learn more than you will in ""On the Road""."
1,tried to cancel,this book was not what i wanted. i did press buy and then i realized within 5 minutes it was like a clift notes book. i wanted just the book. i tried so hard to cancel this but it didnt work and i ended up with something i didnt want. i think trying to cancel within a few minutes of ordering should have worked. i wont do this again
2,Disappointed--Did I Miss Something???,"I must admit, I'm one of those people that trust others' reviews of movies, books, etc. But when I hear the word ""classic"" or ""defining"", I'm beginning to be very skeptical.Case in point: JD Salinger's ""Catcher in the Rye"". Labeled a classic and ""must-read"", I bought it very late in my reading career. I HATED it. I thought it was a dumb story, written in a dumb way (the rambling of a madman!), with an ending that I had figured out only a third of the way into the book.I was drawn to ""On the Road"" by a news magazine's review. ""The 50th Anniversary of a classic that defined a generation..."" blah blah blah.Sorry, I didn't get it. I must have missed something. I give it two stars only because it has been able to make it this far!"
3,An oustanding travel journal- Not a great book,"'On the Road' is important because it was lived, not because it was especially important as literature or because it was especially well written. Kerouac was living in a very unique and fascinating way at the time and he does a workmanlike job of recounting this bohemian lifestyle. This book, as a work of literature is not impressive. It is neither terribly creative nor lyrical.This is the kind of book that is fun to read while travelling. I really enjoyed reading it while I was hitchhiking around Europe. Was I not so steeped in the mystique of the Beatniks, and thus able to connect the characters in the book with these avant-garde celebrities, I may have opted for my Lonely Planet travel guide."
2,bums traveling without a nickle to spend,"The beatniks took advantage of every possible situation that they could control. Their means of exploiting others was to steal. The author makes himself a hero of the times. What modern American would haul his butt across the country, all but penniless, stealing gas along the way? We settle down, get jobs to raise money, and stay near the spot where we earn cash, not because we want to, but because this is simple economics. Most would never steal gas or food, least of all glorify the life of a bum. The author's style has been compared to that of the impressionist painter's. More than not, it is an unfocused wasteland. This IS one book that should be read, though. We see a glimpse of those times and a precursor of the hippies."
3,I found this cult classic only OK,"I feel disappointed with On the Road. I believe my expectations were far to high, perhaps I just don't get it. For one thing I had trouble with the time period (I'm too young). Probably a more mature reader would do better. The story did ramble but I believe that was to be one of its assets. I certainly enjoyed the part in Mexico and drug use before the sixties (had never considered that). Kerouac doesn't seem to have any goals or purpose, but again I believe that is the point he may be trying to make."
5,The Kerouac bible.,"To fully understand the writers of any type of literature you need to get in ther head and see all that they see. Kerouac lets you do this in On The Road. An excellent book about a ""cool' topic."
5,the beat goes on,"I was amazed reading this book because it transfixed and enlightened me on several levels. i loved kerouac's yearning, quest and experience of the transcendent and ephemeral. Kerouac's friendships reminded of close friendships that had nothing to do with social status or level of income, but everything with staying in the moment and feeling alive. I appreciated the honest portrayal of Dean-the self destructive dimension that accompanied his holy madness. On the Road made me wonder to what extent technology/information/computers have numbed the deeper and real transcendent yearnings in our souls, and the corollary to what extent we have wrapped ourselves around this 'new age'. It is interesting that Kerouac took his road experiences onto a level of a genuine spiritual search, a serious study of Buddhism. It was refreshing to experience the joy, life, spontaneity and unpretentiousness of Kerouac and friends."
4,Fantastic Read,"This version is so superior to it's predecessor it hardly seems like the same book. Gone is the 1950's whitewashed sterile version and in it's place we have the gritty, raw, real story of life in a changing post war America. My hesitation in giving this book a 5 star review is no reflection on Kerouac's brilliant prose but on the fact that the editors chose to include a 100+ page introduction that amounts to a long winded, over analysis of the Beat movement that likely would have horrified Kerouac himself."
2,Beat Generation Hip,Stream of consciousness indeed. You must really get in touch with the rhythm of the language here or it's tough going. Perhaps my expectations were to high. Found the lives of these characters rather maudlin. They might have been inebriated but their lives were far short of intoxicating.
1,Monotonous drivel,"I found my copy of On the Road lying on the side of the road (irony, I know). At the time I had a female friend that was very enthusiastic about this book, so I decided to give it a try. After reading it I realized that I probably had the luck of finding it where I did because the previous owner had thrown it out the window in anger, frustration and disgust. This book is terrible. The writing is monotonous. It was a struggle for me to keep the pages turning. There is no plot, but rather Kerouac just strings together events. The characters are unlikeable and shallow. The book is entirely undeserving of its reputation. But despite that, I recommend you read it. Why? Because with more voices telling the honest truth about this book (that it stinks), fewer will be pressured into the ""Kerouac Cult"" by all the wanna-be counter-culture ""intellectuals"" that fawn over this kind of trash. So read it! It is your duty!"
4,interesting but.,"What a pain to read! I really think its cool that they released the original scroll of ""On the Road"" one of my favorite books, but given the option to read this or an other version I'd choose the version that isn't a jumbled mess. I think the concept is great. I always wondered what Kerouac's scroll looked like and this version gives me the opportunity, but if I was reading the book for the first time I wouldn't pick this up. This a very cool copy for Kerouac fans that want a collectors item but if you're reading it for the first time pick another copy."
5,Bohemian Glory Days,"This book is a perfect introduction to the magicof Kerouac. If you have never read this book,you owe it to the collective consciousnessto do so. Kerouac has an amazing abilitywith language. Words kind of dance for him.If you haven't read this book in a while,then you owe it to yourself to give it anotherread. I have always considered this book to be adear friend from an author who inspired me tobecome a writer."
3,Far from walpole,I think Eileen from walpole would like this review of the book. but i bet she wouldn't like the use of improper grammar in describing the book she hates.I think on the road is basically good. It kinda showed me that books can be more than the typical charles dickens' classics they make you read in class.but it has been turned into the bible for so many of these coffee house wanna-beatniks. im glad i read it and thats it.
5,great!,"This is the second time I bought On The Road in the past 15 years. The Original Scroll is in my opinion a better read than the original, it flows a bit better and for some reason I can follow it with more ease than the original."
3,The good ol' days...,"Really hoped I would like it more. Basically the circle of life never ends... Drive, meet new people, get high, go to sleep, wake up and do it again."
2,WHAT''S THE BIG DEAL?,"Touted as one of the classic pieces of literature of the 20th century, I was expecting more than ramblings of a group of Bohemian kids with little purpose in life. The point of the book missed me completely. Perhaps, it is because better stuff has been published since that time. Maybe you had to be there. As an icon to a decade, there was little in the text that was peculiar to that time. Furthermore, the author laid no foundation by portraying convential life in the 40's, leaving no opportunity for the contrast to appear. The writing itself was poetic, rhymic, and at times creative. That rescued a star in my book. On the other hand, I wouldn't waste my time with it again and I would really be ticked off if I had to read it as part of a college class."
1,incredibly disappointing,"The 50th anniversary splash surrounding this ""classic"" finally drove me to try it and I must admit, I really don't know why I bothered. I was 5 years old when this book was written so I was obviously way more a part of the hippie generation than the beat generation. Nevertheless, the story is boring (it's been a long time since it took such a long time to finish a novel)and repetitive, the writing is crappy, the insights are minimal at best, and there is not a single character that mattered to me. I guess I'm glad I finally read it but what a tremendous disappointment."
4,Thoughts On The Road,"Whilst on holiday in Los Angeles I encountered a run down book shop on Santa Monica Blvd and picked up a battered On The Road by the wonderful Jack Kerouac, I love American prose authors had a bargain of an almost original edition.Strangely enough I did not really get into the book until I went on holiday the following year while lounging by the pool, so this book fills me with happy memories for more reason than one.Its serious, its funny, makes you really feel a spirit of the 50's. I am only 25 so will have no recollection of the whole 'Beat' era, but I kind of feel through this that I do. Its dead cool and needs to be read by every secret Rebel Without A Cause out there. READ IT!"
1,On the Road.,"Did not hate it. I have not read it yet, so don't have opinion yet.There should be an option to say it can't be rated when hasn't been read."
5,Who am I to give Kerouac less than 5 stars?,"Who needs a review of a classic like this? This is a replacement copy for me. My original, from years ago, is gone."
5,Insightful,"Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road"" is a great book. It has all the elements of a classic with its profound insights into the human condition."
3,Good Writing but Didn't Speak to Me,"""On the Road"" is the story of a man's physical and spiritual journey through life. I think it is one of those books that you either get, or you don't. I thought it was a good read, but it wasn't spectacular to me. Maybe I'm of the wrong generation. ""On the Road"" is written in a very flowing style, almost becoming poetic at times with it's description of music. I would recommend this book to anyone, if for no other reason, than to judge for yourself whether Kerouac is your kind of author."
4,A BOOK FOR EVERY AMERICAN,"A great read from cover to cover, especially if you need a little adventure about a time before yours. I was born in the late 70s, thisbook made me want t be alive durin the late 40s."
2,One of the Most Overrated Books I've Ever Read,"I'm probably going to get marked unfavorably for this, but I was very disapointed with this book. ""On The Road"" is often listed as one of the ""Great American Novels""...along with the likes of ""Moby Dick"", ""The Great Gatsby"", etc.""On the Road"" however has no plot, no structure, no dramatic arc...whatever you might call it. It reads like just some guy's diary of a road trip. And that is in essence what it is: all the characters are thinly veiled masks of his real life friends. Not there is anything wrong with all this. But in my opinion it's not very good writing, and the worst criticism of all...it's not very interesting. In the words of Truman Capote, ""This isn't writing, this is typing!""It's sole real interest to me was as a historical document of the Beat generation."
2,Nahhh ...,"Tried to like it. Failed. Tried to READ it. Failed. (Page 100 or so.) I liked parts of it - a sense of the wildness of yesteryear's America. But you need a story to move across that setting, not diary entries that come off like a straight-faced 'American Pie'. I can see the appeal, I guess ... chicks, beer, sex, why not. But a 'classic'? On what grounds, for God's sake?Get yourself some Hunter Thompson."
1,Rubish!,"I fail to see how anybody can consider this a great novel. What it the point of it? I mean, first of all, it's boring. But it's not just dull, it leaves no impresion on the reader at all. I know that ""critics"" like to turn up their noses as popular writers such as Stephen King and Anne Rice, but I think you will find that the books they have written (at least the better ones) will have a lot more influence than this little fingernail clipping."
1,Jack Kerouac writes like a drunken 13-year-old,"This is the story of two guys on speed who take endless road trips back and forth across the country for some reason. Its rambling, repetitive, and pointless. The only reason its even this coherent is because it was heavily edited.Driving down I-40 is not a mystical experience."
3,Threw it across the room...,"So... lusting after a road trip of my own, I picked up thisbook and shot through it in a pretty short amount of time. It waspretty captivating at first, and I loved the breakneck pace andnon-stop action. But...it soon grew quite old. I kept expecting Deanto develop (to change as initially promised by Sal), to morph into acomplex, interesting character by the end of the novel-- but it didn'thappen. Dean ended up a broken record, ditching the same situationsagain and again, only to have Sal and the gang react in the same tiredways. As a wise man once said, ""Pretty words...but come toconclusion...!"" The last 100 pages or so were incredibly hard tofinish...I spent a couple of hours on those alone! Frustrations ranso high, I threw it across the room after reading the last page. Styleover substance, undoubtedly. I also got a little bit tired of thebrainless angst... Whine, Whine. Still an enjoyable read, and aninteresting technique...but not a well-rounded book, by any means."
1,"Like, not cool daddy-o","Shave off your goatees all you wannabe beatniks, this book is no bible. It's 200 dull pages about losers who spend most of their time waiting for something to happen. There's no plot, no story. Just hipsters who are not all that hip"
2,On the Road,"Boring and way too repetitious for my taste. No real story line that I could make out. No character depth on any of the major players, including the author."
1,"Oh, I get it...","all the poetic reviews were a setup. How could you people find this romantic? There are no great stories here. Only boredom. Watch paint dry. Thats as exciting as it gets hear. I hope you dont have to read a dry as dust book like this to tell you that being a drifter is fun. Cause if youre looking for insight, it aint here."
1,- take your money elsewhere,"Ok, I heard all the hype about On the Road, mostly from reading Jim Morrison biographies and such during my teens, so when I was in college in '91 and hanging out at my favorite spot, the Broward County Library, I decided to look it up. And you know what? I thought it was the single most over-rated piece of garbage I'd ever read. I couldn't even finish it and believe me, I tried several times. I thought from previous reviews that I'd find a kindred spirit in Dean Moriarty, but he simply grew more and more pathetic as the book wore on. Kerouac sure made a statement with this book - too bad the statement was ""I'm an insipid bore."""
1,This is your brain on drugs,"An excruciating read. The only scene in the book worth any merit was the scene in the jazz club.Kerouac was a conservative that wanted to see how the other half lived. I am tempted to say his cognitive dissonance played a major role in his alcoholic downfall.If you walk the walk, talk the talk."
1,"You're kidding, right?","OK, I tried to read this several times with no luck. It is quite possibly the most boring non-story ever committed to paper. There is no plot, no story, no sympathetic (or otherwise engaging) characters, no compelling reason whatever to read this book. It is essentially a rambling tome about the author and his acquaintances drinking, traveling, talking...it's banality is absolutely stultifying. Yeah, yeah, I have heard all of the claptrap about how it broke new ground and the rest of the bloated claims, but in the final analysis, it is a boring book with no story to tell and nothing to recommend it. It is far more interesting as some symbol to a lost generation than a book. Buy it if you feel that you need some hip, pseudo intellectual credentials on your mantle, but spare yourself the agony of actually trying to read it."
2,Not as good as I expected,"I had heard all of the hype about this book and decided to read it, I was thoroughly dispointed with it. Although I enjoy the passion of a man in writing such a book, the story line was rather bland. It seemed as if the same story was regurgitated over and over again. Sal goes to New York, gets drunk, goes to Denver gets drunk, goes to San Fran., gets drunk, goes back to New York and does it all over again. If this story intrigues you at all I highly recommend reading Henry Miller instead."
3,Ad Nauseam,"It took me seven months to finish this book. 310 pages...seven months...if Sal and Dean went ""on the road"" one more time, I would have killed myself...This book should have been 100 pages...no more...possibly less...does this book have any redeeming value?...i got nothing from it...except for the feeling that i wasted seven months of my life..."
3,Not the Best I've Read,"I will say that ""On the Road"" was a good book, but diffenently not the best of this period. I found Sal and Dean to be extremely lost and pathetic. I was sick and tired with all this travelling they did and living off of others. Where ever they travelled they weren't happy. So what was the use? I say they needed to get some jobs."
5,Unmistakably Charming and Mind Captivating,Once I picked this book up I was not able to put it back down until I had read the whole book from cover to cover. Jack Kerouac wrote very well about the beatnik generation. He was able to keep the readers attention telling of his journeys and expeditions. He unravelled his story extremely well. This is an excellent book to pass on to generations to come.
5,Pure Energy,"This book is pure energy. There is no other way to describe it. The sections on hitch-hiking, night clubs, and various parties etc. are absolutely enthralling. On the Road describes a lifestyle that is freedom in its purest form. Two people, Sal and Dean, who want nothing out of life except to live it. You can open to almost any page and immediately be caught up in the moment."
5,One of the All-Time Greats,One of the best (and most well-known) books Kerouac ever wrote! Takes you on a dream-like journey through America and its people.
5,What else can I say?,"I'll skip all the superlatives that apply to this the finest work Kerouac has done. Mandatory reading and a definite classic. When I read it again these days, it brings a tear to my eyes as this novel could never take place in today's sick society. Hitchhiking and railroad hopping is Russian roulette now."
1,What is the fascination with this book?,"I have tried hard, and read several books by Kerouak, but still can not understand anyones fascination with him. In my humblest opinion, he is the worst writer I have ever read. He lacks description and his viniet is nothing but a description of life as a drug attic. i am sad he shot himself without something better to have left behind."
2,a classic bore,"That the novel had no discernible plot until about two thirds of the way through didn't really bother me. Episodic stories can be interesting if well-written, but this was not. Despite Kerouac's use of the slang of the period, I found the language boring. Bland and pedestrian, but not in a terse, stripped-down way a la Hemingway. The supposed jazz influence that one hears so much about did not translate well. I could relate to the protagonist's youthful restlessness, yet I did not really feel it. I felt as though he and I were both being dragged along instead of seizing the day.This book really reminded me of those stories that people tend to tell in which they realize halfway through that it's one of those ""you had to be there"" experiences. The one redeeming factor that lead me to give the book two stars instead of one was character development, the book's sole strong point."
3,I am getting older...so is this book.,"I read this when I was 20 and loved it. Thought it was thought provoking and exciting. Now in my late sixties, it seems neither. Strikes me now as a little trite and not very well written. I think that some things that are ground breaking in their time don't always pass the test of time."
5,It's all a matter of perspective...,"Genius or ramblings? Read it for yourself and decide. When I got to the line ""the only people for me are the mad ones...the ones...who burn, burn, burn like fabulous yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars"" (found in the early pages of the first chapter), I was hooked. BB King once said that it's not the notes that are played that are important, it's the ones that are NOT played. You'll either hear what Kerouac was saying and be moved by it or walk away thinking he was a semi-literate fool. If you're looking for a linear, consistently paced book with logically developed characterization and an ""A plus B equals C"" sense of structure, don't go anywhere near that book. If you think that Miles Davis was a genius, buy it RIGHT NOW...and read it."
1,boring,I found this book very boring and hard to get into. The story did not go anywhere.Maybe as I am not American I did not understand why this book was such an iconic novel
2,Book Exhilarating - Cassette Boring,"Jack Kerouac's On the Road is a work of delightful honesty; he's everyman heading out on the road. David Carradine's reading of it on the Audiobook version is boring in the extreme and will only make you wonder what all the fuss is about. Carradine should have stuck to Kung Foo. The BBC Radio 4 Book at Bedtime reading by Toby Stephens was much more exciting and in keeping with how Kerouac would have read it himself, is there any chance of a tape of that being released?"
2,Amazing,"It's amazing for one reason: I just didn't get it. The whole book, the whole point. The whole Beat movement apparently. It was a quick read but not really funny or deeply serious. The character moved a lot, had friends that were a tad seedy, and never grew up. He never concluded anything, never had anything solid to call a life. If the beat generation was that hollow...I guess I just don't get it."
2,VERY OVERRATED,"""On the Road"" is a good title because that is all that happens in this book. The characters are going here or going there, and very little happens in between. If anything, I was left with the depressed feeling that during their cross-country trips, absolutely nobody seemed to care for or love these characters. They seem totally on their own."
1,OK - I guess I missed something,"As a 46 year old man, I had never read ""On the Road"" - I first listened to it on Books on Disc on a recent trip - and I thought, must be the medium and the narrator. Then I read it. Well, I was looking for enlightenment, insight, a real internal awaking... and what I read was a long, disjointed story about a dude with no backbone being lead around by a psudointelectual jerk with no respect for anyone but himself. What a total disappointment - if this is what my entire generation based itself upon... then no wonder we are electing whom we are electing."
1,immensely stupid,"It is impossible to imagine why any reader would enjoy this book unless they too long for Neal Cassady to tickle their prostate. This wretched exercise in homoerotic mythopoetics is almost exclusively based on Kerouac's infatuation with Cassady, a by-all-accounts beautiful young man who was, meanwhile, little more than a bisexual, car-stealing, alcoholic, drug-addled punk.Towards the end of the book, as Kerouac lies ill in Mexico and Cassady, quickie divorce from his wife in hand, abandons him to head back to New York & marry anew, we can't help feeling that Kerouac's gotten what he deserved.But the epitaph for this ""novel"" must, inevitably, be Truman Capote's brilliant bon mot, On the Road ""isn't writing; it's typing."" An immensely stupid and unwarrantedly respected piece of dreck.GRADE: F"
1,Very disappointed in this so called American classic.,"I had heard so much about this book that I felt compelled to read it.Although I've read various plotless novels before they always more than compensated with great character development or questioned the readers views.But ""On The Road"" is plotless, characterless and formless.With 50 pages to go I felt that maybe kerouac could pull the threads together but I was to be disappointed.Perhaps in the 50's this was new age hapless wondering without any of the social responsibilities of the age but to this 90's reader it seems very trying."
1,Pointless Garbled Rambling,"I don't need to say much, because I see I'm not alone here. I honestly don't know how anyone can read this whole book. I picked it up really excited to read it and just couldn't get through it. I asked a friend what the big deal with Jack Kerouac was, if I was missing something, he said it was the shock of things he said for the time'so in other words, it's totally outdated!"
1,Ethyl,"Kerouac's car ran out of gas long ago. Anyway, I prefer driving in a chauffeured Mercedes. And now we have electric 4-wheelers. Think of that, Jack !"
4,Your Guide to 'Carpe Diem',"After reading On the Road, one can begin to understand that period in American history. For those interested in the sixties era, this is a must read. If I had only been introduced to Kerouac in high-school; my life's decisions would have been markedly different. In additon, this novel opens the door to a great many other authors who deserve your attention: Kesey, Wolfe, Thompson. Basically, this is the first chapter in the 'Bible' of books I have developed over the past few years. For anyone who has the desire to roam free and seize the day, this is your guide!"
4,"wait, when was this written?","I read the first chapter of this book with a broad grin on my face the whole time. Finally, someone seemed to understand and admit that they had the same spaztic need to discover and experience as anybody growing up in America anywhere must. It was easy to forget what time the book was written in, it seemed so very contemporary, so easily suited to my life today. The book proved to me that every generation is a lost generation, a beat generation, and that nearly all young people become exasperated as they learn that there should be more to life, but there just might not be."
3,the hook is set,"*sigh* so many biased reviews so little time...this book is ""great"" regardless of the opinions of those who seek to deify it and those who wish to trash it. ""Great"" is in quotes the same way television or gunpowder are great. It changed lives, and produced a paradigm shift in writing. It is -not- J.K.'s best work. See ""Mexico City Blues"" or ""Visions of Cody"" for that title, however, it did break thru the boring dull linearity of writing of the time, as did many other greats such as Faulkner, or Hemingway. It captures the excitement of his travels, translates the personal experience to shared experience, however the if excitement wears off on the reader is subjective, however the consequences of this book are great (no quotes)."
5,The greatest account of a lost generaton,"On the Road. The greatest mind expanding book ever. Learn all about the wonderful feeling of being a beat. Riding across the country with the wind at your back. But also, this book is a classic of American Literature. It paved the way for a new method of writing, Spontaeous Bop Prosody. READ THIS BOOK!"
4,everyone's journey,"Kerouac's On the Road is what every person is searching for yet no one knows it. Kerouac's main characters are searching for who they are as they travel to every corner of the country. A view of American life in a time when it was still safe to travel the country by hitchhiking, On the Road offers a look at enigmatic characters who just can't figure out what they are looking for but that is ok because that is what every person does during their journey through life."
2,Rather tame by today's standards,"As this book is widely considered to be one of the best fifty of the 20th century, I was expecting something truly momumental. I am sure that it was quite shocking at the time it was published, but among today's generation of youths, even the unedited version of this book is so tame and lame that it's point has been diminished. The people in this book would be considered goody-two-shoes by today's 20-somethings. As a consequence, I do not believe that this book has withstood the test of time. Unfortunately, the continued devolution of our permissive society has rendered it essentially obsolete, and makes me wonder if this book ever had anything more going for it than shock value."
3,Over-rated Classic,"I found the story to drag on a bit, I think I missed something as people seem to rave about this book. As a non-American the story really didn't grab me. Although I was inspired to be transported back to the era when travel was about hitch-hiking and doing things a bit rougher."
3,Not the epic I originaly thought it was,The first time I read 'On The Road' I was 17. I reread it at age 68. First time I thought it was one of the greatest novels ever written about a search for the meaning of life. I sent me on the road with a duffle and a flat top guitar and a worn copy of the book. Second read was a bit different. I did not want to be or even know Dean Moriarty. He was a swinish self-centered boor. This is a retelling of a drug and alcohol infested search for nothing but instant gratification. Either the world beat me down or the world opened my eyes just a little wider. Either way not a terrible read but nothing to set upon the pedestal.
1,Certainly not a 'classic',"This was really just stream of consciousness drivel. I recognise 'Dean' as being bipolar (manic depression), like myself, not some sort of role model.I was extraordinarily disappointed.I can't even bring myself to finish, which I have never done with a book.The other good clever one star reviews are very accurate.Dissapointing :("
4,Introducing The King of Beat,"Along with Allen Ginsberg's Howl, Kerouac's travel narrative is the perfect point of entrance into the jilted world of the early Beats. Kerouac, the sometimes reluctant King of Beat, engages the reader with the frenetic pace of this novel, which follows its thinly veiled characters across the country several times, and eventually into Mexico. Having read it several times, its energy is equally overwhelming and contagious. Hailed as an American classic, the search for essence and freedom portrayed in the novel lays the foundation for the social upheaval and drug culture of the 60's. While it is not a masterpiece from the standpoint of the literary craft, this often overinterpreted novel nonetheless stands as a cultural landmark and deserves due respect."
4,The book that started it all,"This is the book that started legions of hippies and backpackers on road trips across the US. It's worth reading for enjoyment, sociology, a breathlessly fast writing style, and plain fun. No, it's not for everybody. No, it's not a timeless classic of fine literature. But yes it defined and even helped create the time. It doesn't matter what your age is, but it will appeal more to the young at heart. It offers appealing portraits of important Beat poets and characters such as Allen Ginsberg, Gregory Corso, and others. A must-read for anybody interested in the Beats, and a rewarding read for everyone else."
4,Lovely Read,"This review was 24 years in the making. Cleaning out my shed the other week I stumbled upon OTR amongst a dusty old box of bric a brac. Opening the front cover revealed its origins with a notation "" Happy XMas 88 , I hope this inspires you "" PS "" Listen To REM while you read this , Will "" . Ah , my old buddy from Bundaberg QLD AUST Will H..... , ever the adventure and risk taker , forboding my boring future as it lay out before us . So I read OTR and I pondered , was he Dean and I Sal ? Criss crossing Austrialia to find each other ? Would reading OTR in 1988 have changed the trajectory of our lives ? . Probably . Would I have 3 beautiful daughters now ? Probably not , and there in lies the conflict , do we see Dean and Sal as headonistic self gratifiers or free spirits ? So many lives wrecked as they cut sway across US and Mexico , all for self fulfillment . This is a lovely book that should be read for generations to come , as REM scribed "" Life And How To Live It "" ."
3,Relaxing read...but uneventful,"Jack Kerouac was an extremely vivid writer with an eye for detail and a taste for nostalgia that could make reading his work often quite interesting, but at the same time rather tedious. Either way, I reccommend it"
4,On the Road,"I am a huge fan of both Keroauc and the audio book in general. I am glad this was unabridged. I have a copy of an abridged version that I downloaded a while ago, which cut out some of the flavor of the novel, I thought. However, I didnt care much for Dillons reading of it. It wasnt bad, just not nearly as good and natural sounding as the guy that read the abridged version. But, for the relatively low price of this ten disc set, and the pure enjoyment of the story, this is still a good deal."
1,Incurable Immaturity,"Truman Capote was correct: He said ""On the Road"" wasn't writing; it was typing. QWERTY (on the west coast); QWERTY (on the east coast)--a good sentence, then--QWERTY (on the west coast), QWERTY (in Denver), QWERTY (on the east coast). . ."
1,Boring!!,"Um... I bought this book because it is supposed to be a classic. I forced myself through the first half thinking it would get interesting, but it never did! I started skipping chapters thinking something interesting would happen, but alas, just a bunch of boring events jumbled together. I couldn't even keep track of the characters because they are so forgettable. I don't understand why this book is a ""classic"" I am surprised that anyone likes the thing at all, this is probably the hardest book I have ever tried to get through."
2,I had an easier time reading a Medical Textbook,"Call it being kind of modernized, but how can anyone follow this book? The writing doesn't flow naturally. It's like a bad fanfiction."
3,Strange book,"This was a pretty quick read, and it could've been quicker. The events of this book seemed to be redundant..travel, borrow/steal to sustain, find girls, travel etc. A few entertaining moments that seemed to happen over and over again. Worth a read for some perhaps, but definitely not for everyone. If you don't dig the first 20 pages, you probably won't dig the final 300."
1,... this [was bad],"I just finished reading this book as an assignment for a college history final. After page 150 I was really going nuts reading it. 20 pages into it the book just starts on a broken record repetition of the same thing. Kerouacs writing style is totally unimaginative and dull. The characters are highly detailed, but all the same, none show any initiative to accomplish anything in life other than ""making it"" with ever girl in sight. Drinking and uncured marijuana also play a heavy hand in the books story line, I was so enthused about just getting to the end so I could take my ... test. If this was the life of a beat or hippie, god save their souls."
2,Over rated,"I was really excited to read this book, it is heralded as ground breaking, but I think it's just a story about shallow people being shallow in the end it didn't really do a lot for me. I'd recommend reading anything else. I kept reading looking for the point and never found it. (I understand that the author was playing with words, trying to capture something sylistically, but I really feel that he failed."
2,Talk about a waste of time...,"And to think that this text actually makes it onto high school summer reading lists. Can it really be considered one of those canonical ""must read"" narratives of the 20th century? Ouch, I hope not. Unless you are inspired by reading what are seemingly mindless drug induced ramblings about jumping on the backs of trucks and floundering across the United States, you may want to give your pocketbook a break and pass on this one (yawn).This is certainly a step down from notable American travel fiction -- TRAVELS WITH CHARLEY by Steinbeck or Simone de Beauvoir's (pls. excuse spelling) IN AMERICA detailing her early visit to New York are more likely to inspire a cross country trek across this beautiful country."
3,Road Weary,"I was interested to read ""On the Road"" because of its place in history and its influence on American literature. Parts were interesting and some pretty amusing; but many pages were mundane with page after page of every day detail. I'm not sure what the attraction was to the Beat Generation way of life. Living with alchoholics, hobos, migrant farmers and drug addicts on a shoestring may be attractive to some, but not to most, I think. Kerouac finds his voice, narrating the story with clarity and honesty. Perhaps this is what makes it a worthwhile read."
4,One Hell of a Road Trip,"This is the second Kerouac book I have read so far (my first being the lovely Tristessa), and I was equally and more so impressed with On The Road. It is the story of Sal Paradise's journey all over the great United States and his journey through maturity. In the text we meet iconic characters such as Dean Moriarty and his girl, Mary Lou. This book is an excellent introduction to Kerouac, and to Beat literature overall. Highly reccommended."
1,A Real Chore to Make it Through,"I approached this title with all the expectations fostered by many friends endless promotions. I did my best to like it, to find some secret meaning, some redeeming quality within, to no avail. Actually finishing the book was an accomplishment, in my opinion. Ultimately I found the book aimless, soulless, and the promoter of everything negative about the human species. I know this sounds harsh, but time after time I felt let down by On the Road.No, I don't ""dig"" it, Dean."
5,F'in amazing.,"I'm not sure I can really attempt to convey how amazing this book is. So far, it is the only book that once I finished it, I immediately started reading it. And I have a lot of books."
1,Vastly Overrated,"Knowing the high regard that so many people held this book in, I thought for sure I would be in for a real treat. I was truly disappointed in the lack of story and the overall writing quality of this so-called classic. Not only is the ""story"" uninteresting, but it's told in a very amateur way that uses poor description and sequence to describe an otherwise entertaining series of trips. I may have outgrown the novelty of the ""beat"" lifestyle since I am a little older now, but I think ""On the Road"" would have bored me even in the more nomadic years of my early to mid 20's."
2,What's all the hoopla about?,"I visited some of the beat scenes in this book and of the period in San Francisco. The interest level on scale of one to ten I give it a 4. I should have stopped there. I did this because I read an article about the BEAT Generation and Kerouac, Ginsberg etc. Then I read this book. I find it to be medium on style, short on substance. What do we care about people who sit on crates, drink, wear pants slung low. I think we are supposed to be Dean Moriarty--pretending things are interesting when they really are not. The only good reads were when Sal (Kerouac) says things like ""life is precious"", ..""people that burn burn like fabulous roman candles"" etc. Unfortunately, there are not enough of these. I would wait for the movie, reading the book is an effort. Hopefully, they will punch up the movie. I was disappointed in this book."
3,To Katie from Toronto & Viviiv from Lubbock,"Okay, I guessed I asked for feedback like yours. WE are all entitled...Katie, ""spontaneous prose"" or not, I still didn't like it. Viviv, you made me laugh!"
2,I'd prefer a cup of tea..,"Jack Kerouac discovered ""Beat"" while ""On the road"" and almost sixty years later it's still popular with students (blowing all your money on drink and music, then phoning a rich relative for a top up and ending up three years later, slightly wiser, back in the place you started.)This book is pants...I was expecting so much more...but it comes across as so much middle class toss...and the weird thing is mr K was not a middle class tosser...read his biographies, they are so much better....maybee I had to be there...man."
2,...and how did the story end?,"This book should come complete with a photo of Kerouac as he was at the end of his personal road: a swollen, hateful drunk living at home with his mother. Then his cirrhotic liver shut down and he died. Know it well, ye who pass here."
2,Drugs and fame,"Have you graduated from college and/or have decent writing skills? Okay. Do you ever ponder or consider things as you go through life? Okay. Have you ever taken amphetamines? Okay.............YOU COULD WRITE THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Influential? How about over-rated?!?!I will give Jack this, he had some thoughts...which is more than I can say for many people."
5,Liturature Could Not Get Better,On the Road is a book that people will be reading from genertaions to come. It's a all-time classic and will remain a New York Times bestseller. This book defined a generation of a liturature. I don't think that we'd have the beatles without this book! It's superb and interesting. I loved this book! Read it!
5,my favorite,"Let's make this simple. What we have here is, in my opinion, one of the finest pieces in all of American literature........YAS YAS!"
5,Raw Blues Energy,Roy performs on one of the best live albums ever recorded. In a conversation I had with him back in the 70's I asked him about the album and he told me that the edge came from a fight he had had with his keyboardist shortly before the show. So negative energy can be turned into a positive force. If you miss Roy like I do this is a must for your collection.
2,Not his best work,"I have recently become a fan of Roy Buchanan's and have bought a few cd's of late. I do not recommend buying this one.I much prefer Hot Wire, or When a Guitar Plays the Blues."
3,Puzzling,"My problem with this one isn't the music itself, it's lead vocalist Billy Price. He's just embarrassingly bad on this particular release. However, I've heard some of his later material with his own band in a more Classic Soul mode, & he's phenomenal. Hard to believe it's the same guy."
5,King Roy,"""Can we have a warm New York welcome please for Mr Roy Buchanan"". So begins the best live album from any artist of any musical discipline I've heard. Roy's technical skills are legendary and, on this record, probably displayed to best effect on Roy's Bluz, surely the most searing live blues guitar performance ever committed to vinyl. But the sweet, smooth-as-silk white blues of Can I Change My Mind is probably my favourite. Many of my friends have been turned onto Roy from listening to this album. This album has been part of the soundtrack of my life for the past 24 years. An added bonus is that I live just a few minutes from the butcher shop shown on the front cover! Long live King Roy."
1,Poor writing,"I thought I was getting a historical account, a factual historical account. Unfortunately it's a blend of about 30% fact and 70% farce, and the narrative bounces between the two. I've read a lot of bad books, this was one of the worst because I expected and hoped for so much more."
1,Simple review,"I was intrigued by the title of the book so went to the 'quick view' to read a portion of said book. Here's my take: This is (at best) poor, undisciplined writing. To be fair, I only read the first 4 or 5 pages however, that in itself was a task. The writer strayed around the subject so often that I couldn't help but wonder if this was a book he wrote that paid by the word. The topic is very interesting and I'm sure that had the author been given legitimate editorial guidance the book had the potential to be a wonderful journey. As it is, I wouldn't buy this at any price - too difficult to follow much less to read."
1,"The ""N"" Word","I am black, but I understand that there may be an artistic purpose to the use of the word. Yes, it was used in a segment that discussed slavery, but I still found the use disturbing. Even more disturbing was the cavalier sarcasm that the authors used for Native people, and more so for Blacks. Yes, that was a culturally acceptable attitude THEN."
2,Not very interesting. Don't know how they did that.,"Interesting subject - I thought. Don't know how it was so boring. Even I, a voraciuos reader, could not get engaged in this book."
5,An awesome book that is very realistic.,"Eclipse was one of the best books I ever read. You could really tell how Trina was feeling about her dad and his strange behaviors. It was sort of sad, but lots of people could be living with this problem. It was funny how opposite Miranda and Trina were, for example, Miranda talked nonstop before their puppet show, and Trina just sat there VERY nervously! Trina had so many problems, but she still tried to live her life as best she could. I would definitely read another one of Kristine Franklin's books."
5,great stuff,"Who knew Gene Kelly could sing and Frank Sinatra could dance? And they are VERY good at it, too."
5,Family entertainment,"A film for the whole family, Kelly and the Mexican Hat Dance, should be a kick for the kids (it goes without saying Kelly and Jerry Mouse dancing, is the (arguably) very best sequence with anamation and live action,ever put to film, the romance will appeal to the adults, the singing, especially from Kathryn Grayson is first rate. (I get so tired of people, who find her voice annoying, get a better sound system, or have your hearing checked, or both) a fun film"
3,"They've All Done Better, But...","All the stars have done much better (Singin' in the Rain for Kelly, On the Town for Sinatra, and Kiss Me Kate for Grayson), but Anchors Aweigh is still fun. The story gets kind of old after the first or second time, so I'd just sit through it once, and find where your favourite parts are, then just fast-forward to those when you want to. Big highlights include Sinatra's solos (I Fall in Love Too Easily, Why Does the Sun Set), Gene Kelly's dances, including The Worry Song in which he dances with animated Jerry the Mouse (this was the first time this was accomplished-- Disney was experimenting with it for The Three Caballeros, but Gene Kelly really did it), Grayson's solos (Jealousy, All of a Sudden My Heart Sings), and the numbers with both Gene and Frank, We Hate to Leave and I Begged Her. See it for the stars, songs, and dances, just don't expect too much."
3,good musical,another movie my mom melane wanted with gene kelly and frank sinatra.two more people my mom probably liked.it is mostly about two sailer buddies.sorry I didn't realise it
4,Kelly and Sinatra... What more is there to say?,"A great movie. Gene Kelly *swoon* and Frank Sinatra sing and dance through a movie centered around the U.S. Navy and a 4 day leave. One thing brings this movie down a star: Kathryn Grayson. It's definitely worth checking out, despite her overly-operatic voice. Things to look for: A scene with GK in boxer shorts!"
5,One of my absolute favorite films,"Just sheer joy. Gene looking very, very, VERY good, and dancing very, very, VERY well! They didn't come much better looking or more talented than Gene Kelly, especially in this film. Frank (that voice...ah, that VOICE!) skinny and sincere, playing a shy sailor without any experience with women...who said this boy wasn't an actor?!. In other words, Frank and Gene doing what they do best in brilliant Technicolor. Great music, wonderful sets, terrific comedy, and a groundbreaking dance (the first on film, I believe) between a live action and animated character (Gene and Jerry Mouse in the delightful ""Worry Song""). Kathryn Grayson, a great beauty with a stunning operatic voice, perfectly complements the nautical duo. I've heard the criticism that the film runs too long...personally, I wish it had been a little longer! A great movie and a lot of fun."
2,Anchors A Snore,"We bought this movie because we liked Gene Kelly in ""Singing in the Rain"" so much. While not expecting something quite as wonderful we were indeed surprised at how truly awful it was. The characters annoyed us and the plot was not believable. For a long, long time, we kept hoping for more dancing... or singing... or something... but eventually we went to bed and haven't even finished this movie. The kid was cute, though."
3,The only thing wrong with this movie,"is that it is WAY TOO LONG!!!! Chop off about 30 minutes, and you have a perfectly lovely movie. As it is, it really is only a two and-a-half star film.To this day, filmmakers have not learned this lesson. Less is more, short and sweet, brevity is the soul of wit, etc., etc., etc.""On the Town,"" another musical with Kelly and Sinatra made a few years after this one, is MUCH shorter, and because of that, and ONLY because of that, it is quite better.Just love that young, skinny Sinatra!"
3,Jerry Dances With Gene Kelly,"I haven't seen this movie yet,but I've seen the exerpt from it on Tom And Jerry's Greatest Chases. In the exerpt,Jerry Mouse speaks,which he never usually does. The only phrase he said in the show,""Tom And Jerry"",was the phrase,""Uh....What's Cokkin' toots(which was heard in ""The Zoot Cat"",from 1943). I also seen the exerpt on Disc 1 of Tom And Jerry:Spotlight Collection:Vol.1 and the exerpt from Dangerous When Wet was put on Disc 2. Because of that,I want you to buy this DVD before buying Dangerous When Wet. So Enjoy Buying."
2,Some Magical Moments in MGM Mishmash,"For those who grew up watching Gene Kelly's ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""On the Town,"" the MGM mishmash of ""Anchors Aweigh"" (1945) will prove a disappointment. Nevertheless, there are some magical moments. The film's highlight is Gene's breakthrough dance with Jerry the Mouse - a stunning fusion of animation and live-action. Along the way, Frank Sinatra sings a few memorable numbers amid the Technicolor splendor. However, you must keep your finger on the fast-forward button to encounter these gems. Running 140 minutes, it's obvious that the editor fell asleep at the Moviola. Though directed by the usually reliable George Sidney, one wishes Kelly had more creative control over this unwieldy project."
5,Hard Stuff was worth the wait!!,"It's the best GTD studio album since Move It On Over. What I really like is that there are no weak songs on this CD, unlike previous releases where there appeared to be a lot of filler material. I have had this CD in my car for 4 months and I keep coming back to it. I just can't get enough of it! I can't wait to see my next George Thorogood concert."
5,One of George's best studio albums ever.,Outstanding studio album from a killer live performance band.Not every song is a favorite of mine but it is a diverse album that really shows the bands maturity and growth. 5 stars for a Thorogood studio album. This is not Zepplin 4 and is only compared to George's previous work. The slide work on Huckle Up is sick. John Lee Hooker would be proud.
4,"we now take you 20,000 leagues under the sea ...","Nels Cline resides comfortably in a strange patch of territory where anarchic noise meets battered prog, all firmly grounded in jazz; not quite where Pak or Hella is at, not quite Ornette Coleman or Hawkwind. ""Lake of Fire Memories"" starts out of the gate at a blistering scronk. A difficult, abbreviated descent into hell. Much safer chomping on the title track, longer than an album side and teetering somewhere between an Art Blakey jam, a Sun Ra liftoff and a hearing test. Porous and dense, like a bug in a sponge. Bizarre sounds from battleship undersides in ""Ghost Bell Canto,"" alighting stark, beautiful sculptures: wires coming out of wind, weeds sprouting in the husks of scrapped androids, worms draped in foil."
5,Better than the rest,"I bought Hooray for Boobies and decided to check out their old stuff. HOORAY FOR BOOBIES IS A JOKE COMPARED TO THIS AWESOME CD! Amazing is the only word I can think of. Hooray for Use Your Fingers is more like it, gang."
3,Not as good as some of their newer stuff.,"I hear many people say that this album is only for ""true Bloodhound Gang fans"" and that ""MTV Bloodhound Gang fans will hate this"". I don't even watch MTV, and I also hate to disappoint those that say that, but this album really isn't something to be very proud about. Most of this album is just filled with pointless skits that don't even make sense or aren't funny at all. I also hated how most tracks were just filled with what seems like the band just shouting the same word at the same time (If you want to know what I mean, just listen to the chorus of ""Rang Dang"" and I think you'll know what I'm talking about). The only songs I really enjoyed were ""Coo Coo Ca Choo"" and ""No Rest For The Wicked"". Then there are a couple of decent songs too.If you want to hear a great Bloodhound Gang CD, then get ""Hooray For Boobies"" or ""One Fierce Beer Coaster"". They both show how a group can improve from a lousy album like this."
1,sellouts!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I think one fierce beercoaster is a better CD. compared to this sellout CD!
1,un-able to listen to this,"this is without a doubt the worst album i have ever brought... EVER! i'd say its worth buying just for a joke, light up a couple of spiffs and laugh at the poor quality of this awful disgracement to the name 'music'. The only track worth listening to its the one about the transvesite, made me crack up."
1,Sorry I bought it,"The song ""Bad Touch"" is a great song that one can really move to, however the rest of the album is weak both musically and the groups technique. The album is also very offensive to those of us who believe in Jesus Christ, and had I of known of their demeaning and hateful treatment of Christ, I would not have bought their album."
2,I'm glad they got better,"Like many others, I discovered the Bloodhound Gang via The Bad Touch. I bought Hooray for Boobies and thoroughly enjoyed it. Funny lyrics and catchy tunes. Then I got it in my head to try their other CDs and I ended up with this one. What a disappointment! The lyrics aren't nearly as clever and there's not a decent tune on the whole CD. I'll keep my eyes open for future releases, but I'm not going to touch One Fierce Beer Coaster and I can't wait to sell Use Your Fingers off to the used CD store."
2,A little disappointed...,"After buying One fierce beer coaster and Hooray For Boobies, I found that i wasn't too impressed with this CD. I'm, not one of those fans who saw The Bad Touch on MTV and called myself a Bloodhoundgang fan. I can sincerely say that One Fierce Beer Coaster was as good if not better than Hooray For Boobies. When I got Use Your Fingers, I was disappointed that it was early enough that the band was entirely different. I really miss evil, Q-ball, and spanky. Also, I love Jimmy's rapping and I found that Long Legs didn't impress me as a silly white rapper. Though this CD had its moments, mentionably ""You're Pretty When I'm Drunk,"" ""Legend in my Spare Time,"" and the muffs' ""Kids in America,"" I think I'll stick with the newer Bloodhound gang..."
4,Must Have,"Definatly a must have for all BG fans. Great cd with great songs like ""Legend in my Spare Time"" and ""Mama Say"". This is the cd that started it all well at least it started sumthin. BG is really a great band and Jimmy Pop is a lyrical genius this cd and One Feirce Beer Coaster are their best work though I do enjoy Hooray For Boobies too. One can only hope that they dont change their lyrical stylings for their new cd."
5,BUY IT NOW,This album rocks. It is a lot like the old Beasty Boys but I think a little better. Buy it you won't be sorry in the least bit.
5,one of my favorite cds.,"I loved this cd!the sound , music , lyrics , were all so awesome and different. the lyrics were smoetimes a little crazy..but even better! the bhg is my favorite band of all time!"
4,Bloodhound Gang is God!,I Love the Bloodhound Gang! This is a great cd with really great tracks. Your Pretty When I'm Drunk is the best song on the whole cd. Kids Incorporated was great too! So get this cd now! One Fierce Beer Coaster is even better!
4,Don't take this seriously!,This is an awesome C.D. if you throw all your P.C. tendencies out the window. Have fun with it and the album will make you laugh!
2,not good quality,Bought this to replace the one I had from verizon. It lasted litterally less than 2 weeks. Get the one from Verizon lasts a lot longer. The one I had lasted 1 year before it broke.
3,A Doll's Secret Wish,"This author reveals a special affinity for the unspoken needs and desires of toys, considering the subtle distinctions about what makes them Real. In this very short book, charmingly illustrated by the author's daughter, we meet an old-fashioned wooden doll who has been forgotten for decades in the attic--with only mice and spiders for company. Her dream of course is to be reunited with a little girl who will love her. When a new family moves in downstairs she is hopeful for happiness, but the sisters reject her instantly because she is so plain, dirty and undressed. Are first appearances really that important in our minds? Are children really so heartless? A quaint delight for children of all ages."
5,You Can Tell Georgia To Get This Album,"A great album! Just get ready to listen cause once you start listening to Joe Purdy and his many albums you'll never want to stop. On this album I love ""You can tell Georgia"", ""Can't get it right today"", ""Only four seasons"", and ""the Pretender"", but frankly everything you hear on this album is gold! Don't think about getting his music, just get it. It is worth every penny. So Sit back and enjoy cause you will!"
3,For the Sondheim completist,"I agree with other reviewers that this was an under-rehearsed performance, that Peters' singing is surprisingly sloppy, and that Madeline Kahn is miscast. Other than that... Seriously, unless you must own every piece of coated aluminum with Sondheim's name on it, you might not want to spend big bucks for an OOP copy of this particular disc... three stars for the score, of course."
1,this movie needs some work on the plot.,"This movie I found just kept going on and on. Also, I think they should re-cast their actors/actresses. Once I almost found my self falling asleep, this movie is not for children. But its not for adults either because this movie is TERRIBLE! Though, if you really like crime you might want to watch this movie"
3,More Amber Please!,"Low budget movie made for the rental market.Script made for Amber (limited). Some nudity is present, but not enough for late night cable. Amber shows improvement in her acting. But that's ok since she is still hot. Good for a boring night on television."
5,Matt Monro's Complete Hits,"Matt Monro's Complete Hits is a must to have. His soft, soothing voice is very calming. His upbeat songs are great. I recommend it highly."
1,do not buy this rip-off,This is a cheap Chinese rip-off. Do not support their theft of copyrighted material. They don't honor international copyright laws and put out CDs and DVDs that are actually illegal copies.
1,Punked,"First of all, I had both vinyls (blizzard of ozz, diary of a madman) in the eighties, but sadly I sold, trade and/or lost them.Tired of having sucky bad-compressed mp3s in my PC, I decided to order them both by Amazon. Let's have both CDs! I saw that these were the 95 reissues (with Lee Kerslake & Bob Daisley in the rythm section). I says here: original CD reissues from 1995. Good deal because you can't find them anywhere.But - alas! - I received those goddamned 2002 versions with Sharon & Kelly on bass and drums!Like we say in my good ol'town: Punked!"
1,Don't waste your money,"These discs will not stay on the sander. The pile on the back is so short that it won't attach. I have bosch and makita sanders, and the disc will not stay on either sander. I purchased discs from porter cable at the same time. They are 100% better."
2,Passport by Nana,I love Mouskouri's interpretations but was very disapointed about this particular CD. The song's selection was poor and the quality of the CD is bad. Best CD's in my opinion Un Bolero Por Favor.
4,When will this be out on DVD?,"I thoroughly enjoyed this light comedy. Patrick Dempsey is an entertaining actor, and I really enjoyed his movies in his younger years. Can't wait for this to come out on DVD!"
2,Stupid,"What I don't get is how people liked this movie, despite its paper-thin jokes and some cameos by famous actresses (Kirstie Alley, Carrie Fisher).The thing is, it's only very mildly amusing (and I do put emphasis on very mildly). You'll get bored and want something fresher and funnier. If you want to see a good Patrick Dempsey movie, try ""With Honors."" It's a lot better than the idiotic mess that ""Loverboy"" was made from. The only reason for the second star was that it ended and it had the latter mentioned actresses in it.Rated PG-13 for language and sexual innueudos."
3,NOT PATRICK DEMPSEYS GREATEST FILM!,UNLIKE THE GUY BELOW I MUST SAY THIS FILM IS NOT PATRICK DEMPSEYS BEST FILM.THAT WOULD BE EITHER CANT BUY ME LOVE OR RUN. HOWEVER THIS IS NOT A BAD FILM IF YOU LIKE 90 MINUTES OF RUNNNING AROUND & GETTING IN & TRYING TO GET OUT OF SCRAPES.I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO HAVE SEEN DEMPSEY STICK WITH HIS BLOND HAIR & CLOCKWORK ORANGE TSHIRT THROUGHOUT THE FILM & NOT THE 1st 5 MINUTES THOUGH.
3,Not as good as I remembered,"Remembering how much I enjoyed watching this over and over again on cable when I was younger, I picked this up recently. While it was fun to watch, it's not nearly as good as I remembered. Much of the comedy falls flat, as does a good amount of the acting, script, etc. While I'd still like to see this released on DVD, just to complete my collection of 80's teen comedies, there's a long list of stuff I'd like to see first."
4,Very Funny!,We remember watching this movie years ago and recently ran across it and just had to buy it. It has withstood the test of time and is still just as funny as it was when it first came out. Patrick Dempsey was soooooooo young and such a geek in this movie.Definately a must see for Patrick Dempsey fans!
3,"Great movie, terrible price","I love this movie, it's an 80's classic in my opinion. Patrick Dempsey is absolutely adorable as the teen who mistakenly falls into the line of being a male gigalo. Unfortunately, I cannot bring myself to pay this price for a DVD with absolutely no extras. What were they thinking?!?!? For now I'll just rent this movie and wait for the day that the price drops. Too bad....I was looking forward to buying it."
