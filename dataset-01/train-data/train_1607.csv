2,Too Broad,"I did not like this book very much, and felt that it was simply a re-statement of what the Church has been telling Christians. It was too similar to many of the Christian books that I have read, and there wasn't very much that really seemed to make a difference upon my life. Being a student at a small Christian college myself, my peers and I were unimpressed by the material and I did not personally feel as if I learned from it. The book is culturally relevant, though, and has few good points in the concluding chapter, which was my favorite of the five. If you would like an invigorating read, try a work of Andrew Murray."
3,not bad,"Actually the book was better than 'not bad,' and not only that it was an easy read, knocked it out in 2 days with plenty of time to spare. If you are looking for an easy read it is a 5, if you want something that knock your socks off, well I give it a 3. It was nice easy reading to end the year out with. If there was one negative thing about this book, it was Plantinga's devout following of John Calvin. Not that I think Calvin is bad, but I think Calvin was mentioned and quoted as much as the Bible..."
4,4.5,"Fantasy is easily one of the best songs I've heard in quite some time, the album as a whole is just about as good as the opener, fantasy. I don't know exactly how to describe these guys, kind of a melodic death/progessive type music they play. This is a great album, I would recommend it to anyobdy, give it a listen."
1,Poor,This book was not at all what I expected. It is a small leaflet stapled in the middle. Its contents are not worth even the shipping.
4,if it ain't broke...,"this is a very good album... lots of variety in the song styles. ballads, rockers... songs like ""my white bicycle"" that make you scratch your head and say, ""Huh?"" :)I'd give this one a 5, except for a really bad remix of Morning Dew. If the Doors covered this song, this is what it would sound like... I'd suggest looking in the used CD bins for this album with its original purple cover - that has the same tracks (possibly not the live version of Cocaine... i had it on cassette, and that song was missing) but it has the original version of Morning Dew, which is a song worth a little driving around."
2,GREATEST (?) Hits???,"Nazareth is one of my favorites since 1975 when I heard ""Hair of the Dog"", their 5th album. But these ""greatest hits"" should've called ""some greatest hits, some not at all"" and I would slap the hands of people who composed this stuff... to not do that again. Only one third out of 18 songs deserves to be called ""greatest"", others are too far from that. It looks like the compilation was assembled from whatever songs were available for the producer. This is a crappy approach which allows ""novices"" of Nazareth's fans to get easily disappointed. I have composed 3 (!) my own ""greatest hits"" CDs from Nazareth tunes... It seems the producers were not familiar with Nazareth's 30-year efforts at all. Only tunes 3, 6, 8, 11, 12, 15 and maybe 18 may present Nazareth as one of the best groups in 70's thru 90's. Sad experience..."
3,Nazareth - 'Greatest Hits' (Castle Music),"More or less,just another decent compilation of some of Nazareth's best songs.The CD reissue tags on five(5)bonus cuts which is always good.Timeless gems here include ""Razamanaz"",their top 40 hit ""Love Hurts"",""This Flight Tonight"",their signature song ""Hair Of The Dog"" and their cover of Tomorrow's ""My White Bicycle"".Good if you like '70's hard rock.Duh!"
5,All that is necessary for effective JSP programming,"Ben Forta's JavaServer Pages Application Development will teach even the most novice user all that is necessary for effective JSP programming, with emphasis on techniques that allow the programmers to get the job done quickly and efficiently. Other technologies are introduced as well, including Servlets, the Java language, JDBC, and beans. Using extensive examples, and a hands-on approach, JavaServer Pages Application Development walks the reader through the most important topics for web developers, including security, database interaction, custom tags and scalability. All the examples are based on hard earned, real-world experience. Especialy recommended for Intermediate/Advanced level web page developer. 416pp."
2,Not So Good,"I have mild experience with Java and JSP. This is not a very good book. It does not flow well and is confusing. It is not a typical Ben Forta book, which are usually outstanding. Additionally, the price is ridiculous considering the length and scope of the book. There are many wasted words in this book. I suggest Java Server Pages from Oreilly."
2,So So Money Folding,"I was disappointed with the book. ""The Buck Book"" was a lot better investment, and the instructions were clear as well as humerous. The ""Money Folding"" book left out some key steps, which made it difficult to follow. Ex: The shirt: The bill has to be turned around to make the collar. This was never explained. The butterfly requires using a pipe cleaner to complete the butterfly. Who carries around pipe cleaners in their pockets? Bottom line, your money could be better spent if you want to learn the art of folding money."
1,A Major Disappointment,"I've never felt the need to write a review until today...after waiting anxiously for this book, at first appearance I could not believe that the only folds in the book are the ones you see pictured on the books cover. And if that weren't disappointing enough, the directions were lacking a few of the steps required to make the designs. I am amazed that someone can actually get a book like this one published...big waste of money and I'm sending it back!"
5,The Magic Wand Is Worth the $7,"The directions are well done, but this booklet ""Money Folding "" is just that---a BOOKLET. It has only 6 projects which are shown on the beautifully photographed cover. If you don't think that the 6 projects on the cover are worth the $7 price tag then you will be disappointed. (Add postage to that price if you aren't wise enough to group your purchases to get free shipping). I bought it because I loved the heart shaped ""magic"" wand on the cover. The wand is fabulous and has been a big hit with the kids who have received them from me. I would have paid $7 for just the wand directions but I also liked all of the 6 projects. As another poster reported, I also use a folded money project to leave as a tip in restaurants. BTW--I bought ""Money Folding 2"" by the same author because I liked the flower in a pot project on the cover. I was not as thrilled with that project as I was with the wand but I learned how to do it and then passed the booklet onto a school teacher."
2,"Tasty yes, but very dry","Deliciousness is in the mouth of the beholder, evidently. To me these sardines are a bit disappointing, and while a cut above many single row packed products, they are not really in the same league as King Oscar double row. They are just so darn dry, although they swim in a bath of olive oil.I'll eat what I got, but once gone, they'll be forgotten."
5,Sardines,"Everything is an acquired tastes, whether sardines or vodka. To get the smaller sardines one has to buy the more expensive ones."
1,NOT Crosspacked,"Length:: 1:25 Mins""Crosspack"" sardines are supposed to be the tiniest in the industry, not fat and overgrown.Tiny is best; that is why they come at a premium price.Which I paid.Instead of receiving crosspacked sardines however, inside the tin was THIS (see uploaded movie).The packaging *says* crosspacked yet these definitely are not. Other reviewers have reported the same experience.Crown Prince is supposed to be a premium brand. I gave 5-star reviews recently to two of their other varieties.Not sure what to think here. Either selling lower grade sardines at premium prices is an intentional profit grab by Crown Prince, or quality control in Scotland is badly slipping. Whatever, this is going back."
1,"Ruined an Excellent SARDINE product with ""SALT"" = BAD4U","WHY??? A near Perfect food(SARDINES) RUINED with TOO MUCH SALT/SODIUM(500mg)=21% daily allowance ; The only other canned fish thats ""WORSE"" in Salt/Sodium"" content is ""ANCHOVIES""(UNEATABLE)due to ""OVERWHELMING/KILLER"" Amounts of SALT/SODIUM Content ; TOTALLY ""OUTRAGIOUS"" ; IF YOU want to RUIN your Health/Body : Eat HIGH SALT/Sodium food ; WHY??? is all this ""SALT/SODIUM"" Neccessary , ITS WAY ""OVERKILL"" ""UNneccessary"" TOTALLY ; When the TOTAL SALT/SODIUM content is =2 or ""UNDER"" 200mg , I willnot buy . ; READ THE LABEL BEFORE YOU BUY , Could save your Health ."
2,One great track is all,"The first track ""Show Some Emotion"" is a great piece of work. The melody, and especially the singer's vocal styling are terrific.But the rest of the collection is a muddle. None of the music or singing is memorable. I suppose the lyrics are nice."
4,Takes a little getting used to,"I have to admit I bought this album soley for Drop the Pilot, which I heard almost twenty years ago. Unbelievable voice, incredible talent! Some of the songs and sound will take a little getting used to. But this gritty, heart-wrenching, superbly brutal and honest singer still puts a lot of newer artists to shame! Definately not someone to pass up. A compilation would be the best bet- the strongest of Joan's performances can be found here."
4,More definitive than other Joan compilations,"While this compilation covers more of her songs than ""Track Record"", it still isn't complete. Either way you look at it, you really need to buy all her early albums to fully appreciate the magic of Joan Armatrading.This compilation is ideal though for those just discovering her because it features early gems such as ""Whatever's for Us"" and ""Love & Affection"".Joan was recently voted in the top 200 influential women of rock of all time. Well deserved.Joan is underrated in many countries, and almost forgotten by radio now. It's sad that so many only know her for the success of ""Drop the Pilot"" in 1983. That song is not really representative of her magic."
5,perfect for my hair- type 4c,"i bought the creme in the tube and it works wonders. I am an african woman with the thickest, tightest texture, but this makes my natural hair straight like I have a relaxer (after the flat ironing is done). I highly recommend this product to anyone who has natural hair and is trying to make their hair softer, and able to different styling."
3,"It contains some valuable insights, but lack the details","This is my first book on efficient programming technique. The book offers brief description on how different kinds of memories are organized (specifically, cache and virtual memory). In addition, it breifly introduces data dependencies analysis (which is what I was looking for).The book does not offer detail enough information on how to do the analysis. Also, the examples in the book are too simple to be applied to real-life problem.I was especially disappointed by the content of chapter 10(the chapter on advance optimization). I was expecting something that I could used on my code, but all the chapters talked about was optimization that could only be done by compilers.In conclusion, I think this book is only good for beginners (like me :) who can benefit from some basic ideas on how cache and virtual memory operates and on how the compiler performs some of the optimizations."
3,Misty-eyed Camera,"The dancing in this video is beautiful, with extraordinary balances achieved by Evelyn Hart. However the production values let it down somewhat in that there seems to be a mist filter on all the cameras giving a soft focus to the whole video. Even in close-up it was difficult to see the expressions on the dancers' faces. It also seemed a very dark production in that the lighting never rose above a medium level - perhaps this was in accord with Makarova's dark interpretation of the story.With these exceptions the production is well worth seeing as it gives another take on a well-known ballet. The final scene with Siegried and Odette walking away to an infinity of happiness will not please everyone, but it is surely better than some endings (Nureyev 'wallowing endlessly' in sheets springs to mind!).Ignore any comments about Evelyn Hart's 'thinness' - if she was recovering from the demon anorexia (?) surely she should be given as much support as possible?"
2,Very poor picture,"The picture was so grainy, I thought something was wrong with my DVD/TV. But not so, when I put in other DVDs they had a great picture. The sound was good, but the picture was horrible."
2,London Festival who?,"Talk about overrated. Don't trust the reviewers on this one. I have seen Swan Lake performed live several times, including by American Ballet Theater in New York and Royal Ballet at Covent Garden in London. This DVD is a pale immitation of those productions. The dancing is ok, but uninspired. The production values look dated. And Ms. Hart is certainly no Maya Plisetskaya, the best Odette/Odile ever. If you can find a video of her in SWAN LAKE, get it. If not, I'd suggest going with a DVD of an established ballet company like ABT, Royal Ballet, the Kirov or the Bolshoi."
1,Overproduced and Lackluster,"Overproduction and heavy use of repetitive ""special"" effects (such as Rothbart's enlarged and projected image ""flying"" over the heads of Siegfried and Odette) make this version of Swan Lake funny. Anorexia ""survivor"" Evelyn Hart's role as Odette/Odile makes watching the video painful. She is horribly gaunt and looks too fragile to be dancing: I was plagued with worries that she would collapse at any second.Not worth the money, in my opinion."
1,Bought 3; each lasted less than 5 minutes,"SERIOUSLY. ALL THREE THAT WE ORDERED BROKE WITHIN 5 MINUTES - JUST TRYING TO TURN THEM ON AND OFF. The switch at the back will turn in either direction. But if you turn it in the WRONG direction, just once, something breaks. Most rotating light switches will only rotate in one direction, preventing you from rotating in the wrong direction. This switch is only SUPPOSED to rotate in one direction, but since it does not stop you from rotating it in the other direction, if you turn it the wrong direction, it breaks. I can't believe the manufacture would even ship such garbage."
3,"Cute, not durable","The switch broke on the first day we used this lamp. We removed the black plastic knob covering the switch because it was loose, but still can't consistently get the light to turn on or off without wiggling it a lot. Maybe it's just our bad luck, but we're not impressed with the durability. The clamp is sturdy, and the light is easy to move around, giving you lots of flexibility. Perfect shape for use on the bottom of a bunk bed."
2,Switch broke quickly,"I liked the product, and even though the switch broke the afternoon I opened it, it was still somewhat functional for a few weeks, but now it just shorts out every time I try to turn it off / on, and I'm afraid it will spark a fire. Still on the lookout for a good quality, inexpensive clip-on lamp to read bedtime stories to my daughters by."
1,It broken itself in 2 weeks,"One of the shoddiest product I've ever used. The head is TOO HEAVY to support its own weight, completely negating the function of a flexible neck. Then if that was not enough, the switch broke itself, somehow."
2,lamp,"The lamp works,even thought the design is poor. The heat from the bulb cooks the switch over a couple of years. Nothing else works though."
4,Text Book for Fundraising Newbies to Experienced Professionals,"Using this book as ""the"" textbook for a UCSD Extension class on Fundraising Introduction and Processes; The course is the first required course for a Certificate Program in Fundraising and this is the text book selected. Very in depth, overview of fundraising, annual giving campaigns, special fundraising events, planned giving, grant-writing etc. Covers it all in depth and simple to understand. Great book! Plus its way cheaper thru Amazon than in the UC bookstore ;-)"
5,Good fundraising resource,"Ciconte's book is insightful and thorough. This new edition is especially helpful, especially for the purposes of this reviewer, when it comes to Internet applications and computer programs. A well-written and fairly current fundraising resource guide."
4,James Oscar Smith,"Jimmy Smith was an early Blue Note staple, almost always recording with a trio at first. That's the case here, with Thornel Schwartz on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums. Smith is among the most playful of jazz artists and two tunes (I COVER THE WATERFRONT and MOSTLY MONKISH) feature this side of Jimmy wonderfully. WATERFRONT sounds like a completely different tune as Jimmy fools around with it, and MONKISH is definitely that, though with Smith playing with tongue very much in cheek. FIDDLIN' THE MINORS finds Jimmy almost on fire as he works his way through the riff tune, and I CAN'T GIVE YOU ANYTHING BUT LOVE has a solid medium groove going in it. Perhaps it's just my ears but the Hammond organ would gain a warmer less buzzing-bee sound in just a few years after these 1956 recordings were made. Still, they're wonderful early Jimmy Smith trio sides, foundation stones of what would develop into a prestigious career in jazz."
5,A thorough and documented debunking of revisionist history,"Elizabeth Trindal has done a masterful job of weaving 15 years of research into an enjoyable read of a sadly unmentionable subject. That being the Federal Governments unconstitutional trial and subsequent murder of Mary Surratt. This could very well be a 19th Century version of Ruby Ridge or Waco. And like Ruby Ridge or Waco as long as the economy grows and my neighborhood is safe, who cares what happens to a few folks on the fringe of my sphere. I care. I believe Mary Surratt was an innocent who became a sacrafice on the federal altar of ""make everyone feel good,""justice. Elizabeth Trindal's sad and truthful account of poor Mary only serves to reinforce the old adage,""bad men cannot make good citizens"". I recommend you buy, read and pass along this excellent book. Anyone interested in truthful accounts of our Nation's history will not be able to put it down. Elizabeth Trindal certainly deserves an award and our appreciation for this work."
4,A must read for history and Civil War buffs.,"We must keep our history alive and vividly honest. If we forget or rewrite our history we are doomed to repeat it. These are words that we need to live by today more than ever.If you have been appalled by the tragedy of our government then you must read the story of Mary Surratt. The government has failed before. It seems we learned little from this tragic story.This book is easily read but best of all it was an ""all night"" read. I could not put it down until the last tragic moment. This is american history at its best and at its worst.You will find history, intrigue, mayhem, tragedy, and tons of Civil War info. I hope you'll take the time to read this wonderful book. Enjoy!"
1,Not recommended,"Though a fascinating subject, this was a difficult book to finish. There was very little, if anything, new on the subject of Mary Surratt and the degree of her complicity in the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. The use of ""no doubt"", ""perhaps"", and ""probably"" have no place in a biography purported to be the definitive answer to the question of Mary Surratt's guilt or innocence. The abundance of exclamation points hit a raw nerve, too. Most of us who enjoy reading about history find excitement and fascination without punctuation prompts by the author. Serious readers with even the barest knowledge of the subject should avoid this book. Martha Bricker(mbric@icdc.com) West Point, PA"
4,Well researched and presented,The author did a great job in researching this book. Also presented the facts well. It does look like maybe Mary Surratt was not involved in the planning or discussions about Lincoln's assassination. Very sad.
3,Mary Surratt: An American Tragedy,"Very well documented & interesting, but her writing style is somewhat irritating due to excessive use of exclamation points & frequent injections of opinion."
5,Hauntly familiar,"A few years ago I wouldn't have believed what I read in Mrs. Trindal's account. Now, I not only believe it, I fear it. The same spirit that murdered Mrs. Surratt is alive and well today. That is what makes this book hard to put down. I knew the ending, and I kept hoping against hope that it would change. This is a story that cries out to be told, and the author does an outstanding job of making it read like a murder mystery. Unfortunately, it is not fiction. A must-read for anyone who has questions that aren't being answered by the dominant media."
5,A printable DVD that is reliable; other printables (on my Mac) often prove unwritable.,"My computer (Mac Tower dual 2.75 G processors OS10.4.1) has been unable to write PRINTABLE DVD's of several brands other than SONY. There are always hidden reasons but in any case the SONY PRINTABLES have worked every time. Using an Epson DVD print program, I find that the images I print on printable Sony DVD's come out perfectly."
5,"The Divine Hours, Volume II: Prayers for Autumn and Wintertime","I was given the summer version of this devotional and prayer guide, and immediately bought the fall-winter volume! Being scripture-centered has guided me each day to consider the Lord FIRST and LAST, and has blessed me enormously. Most of the prayers are from the Psalms or from traditional Collects and worship service prayers, combined with scripture verses to bless each morning, noon and night. Highly recommended for beginning and mature Christian devotion and growth!"
4,Good reference,"Having been raised Lutheran and now a Methodist, the concept of ""praying the hours"" was new to me. However, I was looking for a good reference book of daily prayers when I stumbled across this series and I've been very happy with it. If you don't have the time or desire to pray morning, noon, vespers and compline, this is still a good reference and even doing one session per day is a good start to a more disciplined Christian prayer life. The only negative is that the entire series is not available in paperback, so it can get a little pricey if you're on a tight budget."
5,Portable screen,I really love this screen!!! I use it on every trip i go on without tieing up the televisions or bothering anyone. This is great especially for those hotels or places you go that do not have pluggins for you xbox and now ables you to watch movies or play your games.
5,The best kind of regency romance,"I love a strong heroine and a rakish hero. I love witty dialogue and two people who are perfect for each other. This is the best of the best. Like candy, only better for you."
4,Works but you have to find vista drivers online,"I got this adapter so I could use it with my Polar F55 HR monitor. The drivers it came with did not work with Vista. Luckily I was able to google the vista drivers (which happen to be not on the manufacturer's website) using keywords ""kingsun ks-959"" and now it works fine. Big thanks to the fellow who wrote the drivers himself."
1,Don't waste your time,"This product worked once when I installed it, and hasn't worked since. I've wasted hours trying to update drivers, and testing it with different devices, and have decided to just buy a different adapter."
3,USB to IrDA Adapter,"this product works well, but need doesn't have much surport on windows based machine. the cd that came with this ""USB to IrDA Adapter"" are out dated and nt base mashine want load it properly. to use activate plug and play."
2,It's Ok,"This IrDA works fine as far as what it's supposed to do. However, the range is really short. I have to hold my watch right up on the device in order for it to read it...I can't just sit it down nearby. This causes an inconvenience, but I don't have to do upload often nor do I have to upload for long periods of time. I will buy another one in a few months with a better range."
5,Superb!,"It's hard to believe that this CD from Britain's most popular single artist in history has not been released in the US. Utterly ridiculous. This is a double A sided CD. The first song, 21st Century Christmas is a catchy pop tune that really grows on you. The music perfectly reflects the message of the song in such a way that few pop tunes do. The second song, Move It, is a remake of Cliff's 1958 hit which went to number 2 in Great Britain (so did this version). (Cliff is the only artist to hit number 1 with two different versions of the same song and number 2 with two different versions of the same song!). Providing the guitar licks is none other than Queen's own Brian May. What a great song! Can a 66 year old still rock and roll? You better believe it!! It's hard to believe that after 50 years, Cliff can still pump out the pop and then turn around and give us hard drivin' rock n' roll. He has great versatility and this CD shows it. Buy it, you'll love it."
3,Fair to middlin,"Not great, but not terrible either. Crowley lays out a future with genetic engineered human animal composites, that are being hunted down. Once again I came away feeling that perhaps the best part of this story were the parts Crowley DIDNT tell, although perhaps that is his way, making us think of all the interesting things that could be."
2,NOT FOR RANK BEGINNERS,This book has some lovely prickings but for rank beginners it is not advisable. Ms. Stot is void of major and important details needed for someone beginning lace for the first time. I have found that people wanting to learn lace want and NEED more details for what they are learning. They need to work a plain ground and understand why the ground is important. MS. Stot starts her first pricking with a cloth stitch diamond which by most standards does not come about until the 3rd to 5th pricking in most beginning series. I would recommend a different beginning lace book for the rank beginner and Ms. Stot's book futher on.
5,Another Homecoming Hit,"This video is yet another in the Gaither Homecoming Series. It has a companion video entitled ""Irish Homecoming"". Filmed on location in Ireland, ""Whispering Hope"" offers a look at some of the beautiful Irish scenery. It contains some old songs and some new songs performed by Homecoming artists we are familiar with and, of course, just the right blend of humor and gospel music. It is particularly poignant in that it is the last one Rex Nelon was in before he passed away (while on this trip). Whispering Home continues the consistent quality that fans of the Homecoming videos have come to appreciate."
5,The Best CD I Ever Bought!,It's as simple as this: 2 great Carlene Carter LP's plus b-sides on one CD! It does'nt get any better than this!
3,this is not a 5 star cd,"I can't believe this CD is getting 5 star ratingswhile Little Love Letters gets 4. Have ya'll nodescriminating tastes? Face it, Little Love Letters is a10 out of 5, while I feel generous giving thisone a 3. The vocals in half thesesongs are drowned out by instrumentals, andthe techno-pop-disco version of _Ring of Fire_makes me shudder. And what's with the get-upon the back of the CD, is that from some guestappearance on 'Mary Hartman Mary Hartman' or what?"
2,Could be better,"Good story lines actors not very good, Its really a shame this could be a good show but the acting really disappoints the stories are very good the actors that play the brother and the secretary are great!!! the rest not so good just over not good acting.."
1,Amazon delivered the wrong content - twice!,"I actually used the Tivo interface of Amazon instant video. I selected a later episode, but unfortunately Amazon actually pushed an earlier episode. I thought perhaps I had made a mistake, so I carefully went through the process again. I've used Amazon instant video before through the Tivo so it's not an experience problem. The second time I went through the process - I again received the wrong content.I contacted Amazon. They provided no relevant or reasonable explanation and could not explain how the wrong content was delivered - twice. I eventually got a refund, however I am now very suspect of the Amazon Instant Video service, and frankly have little confidence in their ability to manage the system. This happened weeks ago, and there has been ample opportunity to provide feedback - yet they have repeatedly dropped the ball.Bottom line is that it creates questions as to the validity and management of the Instant Video service."
5,gripping tv,"this is a brilliant example of how a tv series should draw you into the thrilling story episode by episode. i can only encourage everyone to give this series a go, and see if they cant see it through to the very end.i can only wait to see the next season."
4,Worth The Watch,"I found this series to be well written, keeps your interest and each episode leaves you wanting more. Definitely worth the time and money."
1,Super sucks!,I bought this product in June 2003. It stopped working 3 months later.First it turned itself off abruptly with NO REASONS. - 1st monthThen strange characters start showing up. - 2nd monthThen nothing showed up on LED and no key works. - 3rd monthI don't think a 128MB MP3 player is supposed only to work for 3 months.Be cautious of this product.
1,Must have PC to burn to CD-R,"The thing I don't like about the RipFlash DX 128 MB Digital Voice Recorder is that this product is missing a built in CD-R recorder. With such a feature the lectures could be permanently archived and played back immediately on a PC, a portable device, or on a Hi-Fi Stereo system. I am getting tired of the daily routine of transferring files between the device and the computer for archiving."
2,No means,"After changed Audio/Video cable due to defective product, aclbe port type was changed.Could not connect to replaced Audio/Video calbe."
1,Cables To Go Sent Wrong Cable!,"The cable they sent me had no resemblence to the cable on tahis page. The only sililarity was that it was black. I am reordering , but my confidance in them is not great, at this point."
1,Bad cable,Cheap but it is not going to work with technical devices. It did not work with my portable hard drive.
1,Not a data cable,"I bought this to update my Escort Passport radar detector. The description says that it is a data cable, but the Escort program can only read info from the device--it cannot send data to it."
2,It didn't last,I'll buy something more expensive next time. After 6 months it has outages probably caused by a wire that is frayed.
3,Fair,"I was a little disappointed, i had a few cables with loose ends and a couple of cable ends that had a rusty look. Not sure I will purchase these cables thru here again."
1,USB 2.0-A to Mini-B Cable 2 Meter/6.56 Feet Black,"I ordered 2 of these cables to replace one that was lost for my dughter's Smartphone. Well they were very cheap and they didn't work...So, save yourself money and just buy the manufacturers cable otherwise you will be donating to the Bad Cable Foundation of Whatever Interprises that got my hard earned money but did not deliver a useable product.....[....]"
1,Didn't fit to use on my Kindle Fire,I'm sure this is a good product but it didn't fit my Kindle Fire so it is useless to me. So much for a good price.
2,"Good connection, no power","Only works if the device has its own power source. Cable had right configuration but couldn't handle the minimal power needs of a 160G WD external hard drive, pocket size. Have two other cables, both too short, that handle both the power and data just fine. Also have a digital camera cable that works with the drive but is needed for the camera, which is why I ordered this one. I'm just using it now to transfer data with other devices but still looking for a longer cable to power the HD."
3,"NO BARGAIN, questionable quality provided by BargainCell","USB is commodity. OK quality. BargainCell is not an easy (or good) company to deal with. I called /emailed 2Xs on subsequent order, and they never called or emailed back. Stock constantly changes. Lacks good product details. They clearly buy products with questionable quality. crappy no name (china?) $7 Camera battery for Sony Bloggie camera died within months, even though I never even used camera for 1 hour! They refused to provide replacement when it is clearly defective. only give you 30 days. No BARGAIN to deal w. BargainCell. they don't stand behind their products and do not care about keeping customers."
1,not as advertised,This is listed as six feet. It is only a little over 3 feet. I won't buy from them again. It is not worth sending back. Too much aggravation.
4,Unable to express the transcendental awesomeness of this cable!,"If you had told me before this cable arrived in the mail that it would have near-magical properties, I'd have laughed in your face and probably emitted a small amount of urine. But it's true! From the moment I opened my mailbox I knew this was no ordinary cable. Its subtle glow seeped through the plastic envelope, intimating visions of Valhalla and Narnia. An ethereal choir sang when I opened the wrapper, sending sublime waves of ecstasy coursing through my entire being. Suddenly all my problems were revealed as mere shades of a long-forgotten fever dream. My eyes opened to the true potential of my spirit, and I knew that from that moment on my life would be free of stress and doubt, and the future was a boundless wonderland of opportunity and adventure.Not too crazy about the color, though. I had hoped it would be a dark gray, but instead it's a light black. So, 4 stars."
5,all is well,"Cable arrived on time, well-packed. Works just fine. I was hoping for a free ThreeWolfMoon tshirt too but no luck there."
5,Works for ps3 controller,Which is what I wanted it for. Showed up on time and no complaints for the quality. Word word word
3,Not what I thought,"I am sure this product is good. It seems to be well made but, it was not what I thought it was. I was looking for a cord to charge my phone. The length was awesome but wasn't the mini end I needed."
4,Pretty good!,"I purchased this item as a replacement cable for the one that usually goes with my Targus cooling fan. It worked just fine and even has a longer cord, so I don't have to worry about it pulling or getting accidentally knocked out, as there is is enough room for me to move things around, without hassle. It was exactly what I needed."
4,Another usb cable of normal quality!,"I am sick of reviewing all of the various HDMI cables I have purchased over the years. This one has a great price/quality intersection. If you are in need of a micro hdmi to hdmi cable at around 6.56 feet, you canot really go wrong. If you need one longer than 6.56 feet, I would stay away from this one, it does not stretch at all."
3,Won't work with my Samsung printer properly,The cable works well with other stuff. The printer works with other cables too. Very strange. I'll use it for something else and be happy. It's cheap.
5,Basic Goodness,"There's not much to say about cables, they either work or they don't. These do, but the important thing is that the cables I would have paid $12.00 for at either of the national two word name chain electronics stores (I wouldn't want to offend them by naming either of them ;) ), I was able to get for under $2.00 from these guys. Same cables, 1/6 the price, and I had to wait about a week instead of getting them at once. Seems like a no brainer unless you have a real emergency need - buy extra ones now so that won't happen is my thought."
1,Made my computer think my GPS drive was corrupt...,"I got this cable to plug my TomTom GPS into my Macbook Pro. I thought since it was just a cable price wouldn't matter, but the cable was poorly made and made my computer think the GPS was corrupt and I couldn't use it. A few weeks later I got a external drive and the cable that came with it let me update my GPS. Bottom line, spend a few more dollars and get a decent cable."
3,A to Mini-b cable,"I bought this cable to replace a misplaced Garmin Nuve 1450 GPS data cable.As an aside, my Canon Powershot S70 digital camera data cable works fine as a substitute cable for my Garmin.The cable under review is advertised to work with the Canon S70 camera---and it does! However, it will not work with the Garmin GPS as a data cable. Go figure. It appears you can charge the Garmin while plugged into a USB port with this cable, but it will not connect to the computer for data transfer.Quality of the cable is fine."
3,Ask any woman if an extra 6 inches make a difference,"The first thing I had to do when I received this in the mail was measure the length of the cord due to my curious nature since all the other similar cables come in at only 6 ft. The result was it measures somewhere around 6 ft but not even close to 6 1/2 ft as advertised. Some might feel this is minor nitpicking, but still I (and a few others apparently after reading similar reviews) don't appreciate being deceived. For my needs, the cable itself worked fine though. I use it to charge and use my PS3 controller for my desktop PC where it's hooked up behind the back of the tower. So for me, the extra 6 inches would've been appreciated since I felt a 10 ft cord was too long.2 stars off for the false advertising."
5,Cheap and functional,"This was a replacement cable to me Blackberry cable and it works great at a good price. The cable length is definitely nowhere close to 2 meters, fortunately it's not a big deal for me, but be careful if you are looking for a longer cable, this is not the one."
1,USB did not fit.,The Mini-Cable B - USB did not fit the device.... Kodak 7.2 MegaPixel Camera. No small challenge in getting the descriptors to match the application. i.e. this may hv been user error.
1,"Blatantly false advertising -- cable is 3 feet, not ""6.56 Feet""","Advertised as ""6.56 Feet"" -- which is blatantly false. Cable is barely 3 feet. I already had a 3-ft. cable, which is why I bought this one. Waste of time and money. Will be returning for full refund. Do not purchase from Amamax. In addition to selling you a different product, you then have to wait a few days for ""approval"" to return what you didn't order."
4,"Cables To Go 27005 USB 2.0 A to Mini-B Cable, Black (2 Meter/6.56 Feet)","I have not yet used the cable however the cables have a quality look an feel to them, I received them on time, there isn't much more to say."
5,USB Cable,You have made this confirmation/review process much too tedious and that is why I usually do not take part in them. cable worked out just fine.
5,Works great,"Got this for charging my windows mobile phone and to have an extra charging wire for my ps3 controllers. Cheap, fast shipping, and works great."
4,Basic with Quality,"This approx 6 foot USB A to Mini-B cable is just what was needed for a communications link between a PC and a GPS unit. Quality manufacturing, decent strain attachments at each end, great price, including shipping! I love it when a good product is sold for a fair price, without gouging the customer!!"
2,Quick ship - Poor cable,"I don't know if I was just unlucky enough to get a defective cable, but it doesn't work. The shipper was very responsive, and I got the item just a few days after I ordered it, so I would give the seller a thumbs up, but the product a thumbs down."
1,Not as long as advertised.,I needed a cable that was the precise length that this was advertised as. The one I received was only 6 feet long. It was not long enough to reach what I needed it to and therefore useless.
1,Cables to go USB to Mini USB Very weak,"I purchased this Cables to Go USB to Mini USB cable to connect an external portable Toshiba HDD to my desktop. The cable diameter is small, and plugs apparently not well made. The second time I used the cable, the system was unable to find the HDD. Switched to Amazon Basics cable. It is larger diameter and better made. Had no problems. Failure after one light use indicates cable is not well made, especially attachment of end plugs. Try another brand."
1,Didn't work for me,"This cable did not work at all with my portable Lacie Nikki Drive in either my 17"" Macbook Pro or 24""iMac"
5,Exactly what I needed,"I wanted a shorter cable to charge my Motorola Bluetooth headset, and this cable works perfectly! It is thicker than my other data cables, but it doesn't interfere with anything. The price was great as well! Very happy with this purchase!"
4,Works great with my Nuvi GPS,"I bought this cable to replace the cable/charger that I used in my car. I did not want to pay for the original replacement and since I already had a USB charger in my car for my ipod I decided to try this.This cable charges my Nuvi GPS.The only ""problem"" is that it will take you a couple of mins to get your GPS started, since once you connect the cable to the GPS and to the lighter charger, it will get into ""sync"" mode. This takes a couple of mins and then it will start as it normally does.P.s: You need to buy the lighter charger for a USB"
2,It would not do the job.,"The cable was needed to connect a hard drive with video material to a Mac laptop. No joy. The same drive and laptop were connected with a shorter (8"") USB/usb cable with an RF filter (Cylindrical overmoulded part) and it worked perfectly. Live and learn... or make the same mistakes again."
4,Great supplemental cords,"I orderd these as supplemental cords for charging my Apple products on the go, and at the office. They worked very well and were a perfect fit. Plus, the extra length comes in very handy makes them even more conenient than actual Apple cords. I highly recommend them."
2,incorrect product description,"Purchased the 1 meter (39 inches) version. The cable supplied is 60 inches, much to long for my application. So far It works OK to quickly connect devices, but I didn't want extra cable sprawling atop my desk. This one goes in the drawer. Will use a cable from another supplier that is the preferred 1 meter length."
3,"Ok, but","It's a $3 USB cable, so there's not a lot to say. Works fine for my camera. Doesn't work for my external HD! I think it doesn't provie enough power."
5,works with toshiba external HD,I bought this because the cable that came with the toshiba external HD is too short (barely 1 foot). took a chance coz I didn't know if the cable length would affect performance. hooked it up yesterday and my desktop can now see the drive. no more awkwardly located external HD.
1,Caution: This Cable Does NOT Work with USB Hard Drives,It does not work with my USB hard drive. I am using a Macbook Pro that runs Snow Leopard. My laptop does not recognize at all my device using this cable. I feel regretful not to have read another review above complaining about a similar problem before I made the purchase. Obviously this cable has serious problem with connecting USB hard drives to computers running multiple operating systems.
3,"Not quite as advertised, but it works.","I needed this cable for my Mio GPS. I think Mio should have included it as an accessory in the box but I guess they didn't feel it was necessary. So anyway, I ordered two of these cables from the seller ClearAV. Delivery was OK, I received the cables a week after placing my order. But the cable is not 6ft long, despite what it says on the package. The actual length is 40.5 inches. I don't know if you'll get the same cables if you order from a different seller. Nevertheless, I used the cable to hook up my GPS to my computer and it worked fine. My GPS charged up nicely and transferred files with no problems. So I guess I'm OK with them."
3,works fine,I bought this for a digital frame to download images... then realized it's the exact same cord my PS3 uses to recharge controllers... oh well.
5,charges my Hero in the car,I bought this in conjunction with a USB car charger and it works just fine to power my HTC Hero on car rides.
1,Unstable cables not data cable only for charging,"I tried connecting it my Western Digital portable hard disk and the connection is not at all stable. It connects and then disconnects immediately and then connects again and on and on. These are not data cables, they are charging cables."
1,Doesn't Supply Enough Power,"I usually haven't had issues with cheap cables, but this one won't supply enough power to my external hard drive. It lights up the led on the HD, but it doesn't spin up.It also will only charge my PS3 controllers for about a minute before dropping the connection. The lights on the controller just stop blinking and that's that. I have to reconnect it to make it do anything.In the end this cable ended up being completely useless for me. Don't buy it if you're connecting things that need power."
5,Great product,"The chord for my hard drive broke and I almost died of relief when I saw this on Amazon. It works really great, has a nice length for the cable (if that is something you think about), and it was delivered almost a day after I purchased it. Good product, great shipping. Good job, internet."
5,Great length for charging,"The cable feels well built, and has been successfully used for charging phones and PS3 controllers. I have not yet tested it for how it affects high-speed data transfer rates, but I bought it primarily for charging devices. Since the PS3 controllers were operational through the cable, it does mean that the data transfer abilities of the cable do work."
5,"good cable, no need to pay for some brandname","I use these cables for connecting MP3 devices and such, and also for connecting my Razr cellphone, using the Motorola Phone Tools software on my computer. (Note that for the latter purpose, you can actually use Bluetooth if you want to, and have the capability on your computer.)Cable works perfectly, no problems or hassles. Construction quality is good. This is pretty basic technology after all."
2,Useless with external hard drives; Okay for charging ps3 controller.,"I ordered this 'cos price was low. Tried connecting a Western Digital Elements 500gb portable hard disk and a 120gb hitachi 2.5 inch sata hard disk in an Acomdata Tango enclosure to my laptop using this. Connection is not at all stable. It connects and then disconnects immediately and then connects again and on and on. If left connected it'll probably damage the external hard drive. So right now, I'm using it only for charging my PS3 controller. Seems to be good for that. Hence the 2 stars."
1,Not for USB drives!,"As others have said, this cable will not transmit enough power to run a USB hard drive. Not a bus-powered hard drive, not a powered hard drive, not a hub connected to a powered hard drive. If you like the sickening beep that hard drives make when they're attached to an intermittent power source (and the sickening clicking they'll soon make after that), then go ahead and plug your drive into this cable. It's your honeymoon photos on there, not mine.But if you value your hard drive, heed my advice (which is identical to the advice others have posted here) and spend a few extra cents on a better cable. I thought the unit I got was defective, but the replacement cable (which cmple very responsively shipped) was exactly the same. Cmple has since very courteously refunded the purchase price of the product, and I think they deserve a lot of credit for that. But unfortunately it doesn't change the fact that, with hard drives, not working is just a feature this product has."
1,does NOT work with WD MyPassport Essential ext drive ....,"Tried using this for two ext drives, a 160gb and a 320gb WD MyPassport Essential.It does NOT work at all. I have Windows XP SP2. When using the short USB cable provided by WD, the ext drives are recognized, BUT not when using this cable.When I plug it in, it asks for a DRIVER software. I already researched this andit does NOT need one, just plug and play.Did I get a bad cable copy or is it NOT compatible ? Not sure. All I know is thatit does NOT work using this cable."
2,not for hard drives,I have a western digital elements external hard drive and this cable did not work with it. if I use the cable that came with my digital camera it does work on that hard drive. dont get this if you want to use it with a portable hard drive IMO
5,Cables to Go,Could not find the same cable as low priced as this was in any of my local stores and it works great.
5,Great customer service,Initially I had a problem connecting the cable to my external hard drive. Tech support answered my call quickly-no long waits- and solved my problem.I have renewed faith that some companies take their customer service seriously.
1,doesnt work as expected.,"I bought this a couple weeks back.I did try to use it with seagate/WD portable external harddrive.It supplies power but doesnt detect the harddrive in my system.Thanks for the customer service people as i requested them send an other one, even the second did not work.So i dont recommend."
3,Does not work as a cable for charging etc.,"Most people would not buy these cables for the reason I did... I was trying to find a longer usb cable to use with my GPS unit in the car and with my usb adaptors that I have for my power source. If you are trying to do something similar, FYI this cable will work on your computer, but my GPS unit kept saying that ""USB connection found"" But would not charge. I just used the old cable, I am sure I'll find a use for these at some point."
1,Waste of Money!,"I don't know why the description for this item isn't changed to reflect the fact it does not work on USB drives. It works on most of my other devices, but basically it is a cheap POC."
5,cable,Product arrived within a week and fit the camera as described. So far it works great. Couldn't have been a better price.
1,didn't work for Kindle Fire,"For me it didn't work. I am sure it's a fine cable! Unless I am doing something really wrong, I can't get it to fit into the Kindle Fire. I just ordered a different cable - am sure I can use this one at some point."
5,Solved My Problem,Needed a special cable for travel and the car for my my HTC phone and they had it - Purchased at Amazon
1,Did not work.,Could not connect external hard drive for backup with a 2009 Mac Pro using this cable. Would not recommend this one.
2,postage,"for an item of $2.95 and the postage was $45.00 ,the cost for the post was far too high,i just orded a ham radio from USA the cost for this item was $45.00 i just dont understand,why a small oject is the smam price as a large oject"
3,Phoenix,"I received a fine cable with prompt delivery but it wasn't one meter, only about seven inches long. I would like to get a longer one but it is too much trouble to return this one."
5,A cable that works,"Nothing too special about the cable really. It works well with my equipment, and fits snugly into each receiving end no problem.I didn't realize how short 1 meter is but it's not like I'll be attaching my equipment from across the room anyway."
5,from religion to relationship,"An excellent companion to Swindol's book with the same title. But only for those who desire a deep, intimate relationship with God and not just temporal knowledge of Him. This workbook contains excellent challenges and exercises that are doable and tangible."
5,So YOu Want to be Like Christ,This book and study guide was excellent. It had great questions and made you challenge your own lifestyle. I grew during this study.
3,Slow start but reels you in at the end,"It took me awhile to get into this book and I was a little worried especially since I also have 4 or 5 more books of this series. Luckily about halfway through I started getting into the groove. My initial turn off was Kitty seemed so spineless and I didn't care for her submissive behavior towards Carl. Yes, I know that is wolf pack behavior but it still rubbed me the wrong way. I loved Cormac, TJ and even the little we saw of the vampire Rick. I am hoping to see more of Rick and definitely more of Cormac in the future. The chemistry between Cormac and Kitty was definitely smokin'! I'll be curious to see how Kitty's self confidence evolves."
4,Interesting,"The story centers around Kitty, a late night DJ who hosts the Midnight Hour, a supernatural feel show that catches like wild fire. Soon other stations are begging for her to sign on so they can air the show, all the while Kitty is trying to figure out who has it out for her, or it's curtains for her.I found the story to be pretty interesting, it was different from what I have read as far as vampire, werewolf and other supernatural elements go. There are a few things I disliked about the book, such as the description she uses when talking about the wolf.But other then that, it was really good. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good supernatural story unless you are a little sensitive to rape. There is a small scene in the book, that may make some readers uncomfortable."
2,Read lots of reviews before you buy this book,"Poor example of the genre. the book is chock full of werewolves and vampires, but characters are cliche and shallow. The plot and setting were so full of holes that I couldnt suspend my disbelief enough to just enjoy it as a junk food read. I really regret paying for this book. Check out the Mercede Thompson series instead for werewolves, or Robin McKinleys Sunshine for some vampires."
4,Read This When You're Brainfried,"Okay, so you've been reading Fountainhead and Orson Scott Card... now put them down and give your brain a break. Pick up a Kitty book and waltz through it to remind yourself that the world can be hard and still funny without preaching at you about anything.Or maybe you just don't want to work hard at reading a good book with good characters and easy plots, then pick up the book and relax...Every once in a while I want a book that doesn't make you work for the message behind the scenes. This book is straightforward and entertaining. Dialogue flows naturally and scenes are complete without being over-examined."
1,Disappointed,"I really liked the premise of this book but the more I read, the less I liked Kitty. She was a victim pretty much throughout the book. She has a few stand up moments but ultimately she whines and someone else saves her or handles clean up. I know that the author was trying to show her making a transition from a victom to a strong empowered person but she fell short. In the end, Kitty just ran away in my opinion. She had not evolved very much. I really do not care to read another book in this series."
3,The werewolfs of Denver...Ahwooooo!,"It was light but entertaining. I found a few small...""mistakes"" in the story but nothing to make a big deal about. I think Ms. Vaughn shows a good imagination and a good writing style. If you are looking for a quick easy read and enjoy fantasy, I recommend it."
4,Mostly fun read,"This was definitely a fairly easy read, though there was (for me, at least) a surprise in the end that jarred with what I thought of as paranormal ""chick-lit"", and kinda depressed me towards the end. Overall I did enjoy it however and plan to read the sequel."
4,A Lot Promise,I picked this series up with a strong female character in mind start to finish and was disappointed in the beginning. As the story progressed Kitty started to develope and become that strong character I was looking for in the beginning. I enjoyed the story and I am curious to where she goes from here. I will be finishing the series.
4,Dr Laura for Critters?,"This was an excellent book. I gave it 4 stars, subtracting a star, because it's an obvious series setup, the book does not stand completely alone as there are several open threads at the end.However, it is a strong enough story to make it worth reading, even if you are wondering about some of the characters and sub plots.Kitty is a DJ on a midnight show. She's a reluctant werewolf, and starts a talk show to give advice for preternatural creatures. What could be treated with camp or melodrama is instead neither. It's a riveting story, living her pack life with her, finding out how she became what she did, and how she copes overall. At the same time, there's a suspenseful plot and lots of action. Unlike most of the supernatural stuff these days, there's little physical attraction and no romance (sigh of relief).In all a great story, totally worth reading."
2,Not too impressed,"The story was slow moving & I wasn't crazy about Kitty. The plot was predictable, the characters were shallow, & I just wasn't left with the desire to read Kitty's next book."
3,Kitty the Whiner,"I liked the premise of the book, a werewolf DJ who starts a radio talk show for all the supernaturals out there. Her show is a hit and skyrockets Kitty to minor celebrity and of course danger. My problem with the book is that Kitty is a bit of a whiner and really a little petty. She is weak and her pack is super dysfunctional. There is a bit of romance in there but it is so dysfunctional I don't think it counts. There is an upside. The book does get better towards the end and the next one may actually have a braver, brighter Kitty."
1,Disappointed,"I was glad I borrowed from the library and didn't waste my money. None of the characters except Kitty even had a last name. This tells me that the author didn't invest much in the characters she created. You had to read well over half of the book before you found out why Kitty was such ""whiner"". Not sure if I'll attempt to read another from the series, but if I do, I'll make sure I check it out at the library."
5,Such an interesting idea!,This book must've taken some serious brainstorming! The ideas are vastly original and executed quite well.
4,Werewolf talk radio.....,"Character growth is easily the driving force of this novel. Kitty starts off the novel as being weak, passive, and abused. By the end of the novel she has learned a bit about fighting and how to stand on her own two feet. The best part is how she makes this transformation is a realistic fashion. Kitty is a likable character and you find yourself rooting for her with every challenge she faces. Excellent novel. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the book pretty much requires you to read the next novel due to a few cliffhangers left in the previous novel in the way of a possible cure and the man selling it."
3,Good First Book in a Series,"For fans of the paranormal romance genre, you could do worse than picking up a copy of ""Kitty and the Midnight Hour"". Kitty Norville has a radio show in Colorado that she enjoys doing far into the night. She's also a werewolf with pack issues. When her improvisational show about the creatures of the night starts getting popular, she finds herself having to battle not only a local group of vampires, but maybe members of her own pack as well. Throw in a fundamentalist preacher who may have a cure for her werewolf disease, and you've got one exciting debut novel. The pack dynamics were kind of creepy, and you don't feel like Kitty's in much danger (this is a series, after all), but all-in-all it was a good first book. Fans of early Anita Blake will enjoy it. It is heavy on the action, and light on the romance though."
3,Slow Start but Better Finish,"This book, all about the adventures of late-night radio DJ Kitty who happens to be a werewolf, starts off very slowly. At the beginning, I didn't much care for this character who seemed entirely too inclined to allow other people to bully her and fight her battles. I recommend sticking with the book though, as the last 2/3 of the book proves to be much better than the rocky start. Kitty grows up a lot in this book and I am hopeful that a sequel will be even better. I love the portrayal of the werewolf pack and the interpersonal dynamics as Kitty struggles her way through the tough changes in her life. The vampire Family dynamics were also extremely interesting and I hope that they are explored more in depth in the next book. The appearance of a recurring villain was also quite refreshing, giving the main character a challenge while not allowing her to become too powerful too quickly. I think readers who stick it out to the end will be glad they did!"
5,Fun Fun Fun,"Light, Sassy and fast paced, this book was fun to read from beginning to end. I mean a werewolf named Kitty. I can't wait until she goes to Washington."
5,Great Start of a new Series,I can't help it. I am in love with a werewolf named Kitty. As she said she had the name before she was a were. I like the world and the characters.
3,"NOT Buffy, but...","Geez, I miss Buffy the Vampire Slayer SO MUCH.So I've been trying some of the (many) new paranormal series to try to fill that hole. The upshot here is that I liked Kitty very much, but the plot was underdeveloped and the ending left me cold. I'll definately check out the next installment, but hope for better."
5,Very different werewolf heroine,"I was pleasantly surprised at how different this book was from typical paranormal romance. For starters, there wasn't really much romance. I have to say I didn't really miss it - probably because there was so much other stuff going on. Kitty is not the stereotypical paranormal heroine. She doesn't kick butt and take names - she's just trying to survive. She was pretty much an average woman who happened to also be a werewolf. I'm looking forward to continuing with the series and seeing what happens next."
3,Not what I was expecting,"At firs this a great story and I'm totally loving it but then it takes a turn for the strange. I really like the concept of a werewolf dj giving advice. But the whole dynamic between her and her alpha kinda creeped me out. She made him like too much of a father figure so when they sleep together, which in a way comes across as forceful, it's all very uncomfortable. There's more with the story I don't really like, but I won't give out all the spoilers. I felt the whole story could have gone a different direction but I guess I just don't get The authors vision. Don't think I'll be reading any more of this series."
4,being a Werewolf is not easy,"Kitty is a werewolf radio alternative music host on late night public radio show. She stays off the main grid until, she starts letting her otherness drift into her radio show and becomes a public celebrity as a werewolf. Her pack, the local vampires and some religious factions are not pleased about her coming out and opening that whole can of worms. She as a submissive wolf must learn to deal with people trying to kill her, the cops trying to use her, her pack power struggles and try to help solve some recent murders. Life is never easy.I really enjoyed this romp through Kitties world. She grows and finds herself solving her own problems through trial and error. The pack dynamics where realistic, as was her character. A good solid urban fantasy."
4,"Not a whiner,","I found this book to be very enjoyable. While most of the 1-star critics gave it one star because of her submissive behaviors, it only takes away one star for me because of the whole experience. Did it make it a little uncomfortable at times, yes, but without it her development in later books would not be as pleasing. Here we have a smart-alec who gets knocked down when she gets bitten by a werewolf, rises up a little by her own determination and gets knocked down at the end of the book. This is the pattern that the author gives us throughout the series, it is the fact that Kitty keeps getting up that makes her a good character."
3,a good product,"Unfortunately, the day I switched out my Old Glory for this one, my partner & I were jumped -no one injured, nothing taken but still it shook us up and now the flag will have to find some other use"
5,BEAUTIFUL,"Bought the book that goes with this, as we live on the southern Alabama coast, and Peter's books are so awesome, I paid the price for the book of the story of his journey by boat that took a couple years, and then bought a copy of this picture of mostly pictures. Some are from our area, and an abundance of pictures of the whole Gulf Coast.I highly recommend it as a companion to the book about the story."
3,Power when and where you want it.,"We took a 22 hour trip. We used this Belkin power supply for everything we needed to normally plug into our electric outlets at home. It worked for everything. The kids watched videos on the laptop without worrying about the battery dying in the middle. We charged our cell phones, ipods, extra rechargable batteries; everything we needed we charged in the car thanks to this Belkin power supply."
5,Spock of the Future!,"Finally, the definitive book for expecting fathers! Here Mr. Dunton combines the sensitivity of Spock with the writing talent of a modern Fitzgerald. I've read alot of baby books, but this one is the best. I recommend it to all Dads and Moms."
4,Haunting collections of songs from one of the better rock,"Suzanne Vega has always been known for her quirky songs and production. This CD is no exception. The production of this CD is what makes it such a pleasure, the use of a variety of instruments in a style that will remind you of the Beatles' Abbey Road. Every song is good and this CD will slowly crawl inside your head and make you realize that Suzanne Vega is really good. When listening, try ""Caramel"" (tr#3), ""Headshots"" (tr#2), ""Thin Man"" (tr#6), and ""No Cheap Thrill"" (tr#7)."
2,Not what I expected...,"The CD itself was in okay condition, but the case left much to be desired. Was going to use this as a Christmas gift, but went ahead and gave it to my daughter because I would have been embarassed to use it for a gift. Shipping, however, was extremely fast."
5,Ester C,I have been using this product for several years as a cold preventative and am happy with the results. I would recommend this product to all.
2,Even Dumber Than You'd Expect,I wasn't expecting much in the way of humor - just something to get a laugh out of a duct tape enthusiast when he found it in his Christmas stocking. He laughed when he saw it - but there wasn't much to laugh at in the content. Really lame stuff.
5,A fabulous film,This movie captivated me and transported me - it was filled with unknown (to me) actors and so real and so beautiful in so many ways. I loved it!
2,Odd Movie Seeks to Manipulate,"This movie is a disappointment. A nice premise falls flat when the lead character proves himself to be an idealistic wimp. Some of the supporting characters are well played, notably the two major female figures, Frida Hallgren and Helen Sjöholm as Lena and Gabriella. In typical fashion for a post-1960s film, the church is portrayed as corrupt and hypocritical, causing me to wonder anew whether there are any screenwriters or directors out there with a spiritual backbone. The so-called climax of the movie is laughably unconvincing, when an entire audience is won over by a motley choir voicing nonsense syllables on stage. (This ranks right down there with the ridiculous town hall meeting in ""Field of Dreams"" for shallow audience manipulation.) Don't bother with this promising flop. It does not deliver."
1,Terrible,"I endured about 30 minutes of this corny, cliched forced tripe. Can't believe it got good reviews.Skimmed through the rest and it wasn't getting any better. Agree with the other 1 start reviews completely.Glad I didn't pay to see it at the theater."
1,speed reading,"I gave this movie a one star, but only because there is no possibility to give it a zero.But I must qualify my statement: in all fairness, I have no idea whether this movie is good, bad or mediocre, because I do not know. The English subtitles are whisked away so quickly from the screen that although I am not a slow reader, still at times I did not even get half of the written text, let alone had a chance to even glance at the acting. It was a momentous experience in sheer frustration and I am sorry I bought the movie."
4,Swedish film at it's best,"I first heard about this movie when I heard the music from it. Gabriela's Song is really powerful, music and words. The movie is an ensemble of the best in Swedish acting talent. They do not disappoint. This edition has English subtitles that I have not figured out how to turn off. The translation is not quite on, but conveys the general feeling."
2,Predictable,"The plot is predictable, and the film maker exploits every cliche and stereotype about those who experience trauma in their lives. It's simply too much for one movie, and it does not leave much to the viewer's imagination. There is little left to wonder about after the story is told. Perhaps one could be captivated by the relationship of this or that character to another, but for the most part, the characters are too thoroughly explained. The music, however, is beautiful."
5,Swedish film,This is a GREAT movie! I only wish there was a soundtrack available. I know that there is one out there but it is EXPENSIVE and the reviews are awful! The music is the ticket with this movie. Great film!
5,The power of sound,"This is the first movie I've been to where at the end I wanted to stand and applaud. I think the sound of the choir at the end had such an overwhelming physical affect I was physically and emotionally moved. I felt as if all my cells were hopping.After I saw this film I heard a physician on public radio talking about 'sound therapy' and the ways in which music, song and sound can heal the body."
1,Low on Instruction Content,"I am a big fan of Jimmy Connors, but I can't recommend this DVD. Most of the content is simply video of group lessons where a class of teenage students go through various drills. This is the kind of thing you can watch at your local tennis facility for free. There is little discussion of technique and in fact there is little discussion at all. There are a few chapters where Jimmy and one of his guest stars discuss an aspect of the game, but these are very light in content and really don't justify the purchase."
5,Nine Wonderful Months B;Shaah Tovah,"very informative, just the right balance of what we were looking for in this type of a book. I would highly recommend it."
5,One of the best Kate Sheridan books ever!,"I have been reading this series for some time, and I enjoy it very much, but this book is far and away the best of the bunch. The best thing about these books is the way that the writing duo of Susan and Bill Albert mix real historical figures and actual historical happenings into a plot for their books. I also enjoy Kate and Charles Sheridan very much. The books are written with enough detail and with enough of an interesting plot to keep readers involved. In this book Kate and Charles are unravelling a series of mysteries at Blenheim Palace. We also are treated to a really good characterization of Winston Churchill as a young man. Blenheim Palace is his historical home as he was also a Marlborough (although never the Duke of Marlborough). Wonderful book."
3,Historial Research?,"I love to read historial mysteries but do expect the authors to do their due diligence on facts. The author made a major historical error when it was stated that the Churchills did not have the ""deep pockets"" to continue after Queen Anne said no to the costs involved with the continuation of the building of Blenheim. Duchess Sarah and Duke John jointly had an income greater that Queen Anne's! In addition the costs escalated because Sarah kept changing what she wanted and made the architect rebuild again and again. If you try that with today's builders, you will find out how that increases your costs.I wonder what other facts were mistated?"
4,"Cool, but should be textured.","This looks awesome and I like that they came in cool little case. They work well with my nerdy grad student apartment. They are nice quality I guess, but I wish they were textured instead of smooth, because a lot of times I'll pick up a glass and walk across the room and have a coaster still stuck to the bottom. A minor complaint. They save my $10 coffee table from water rings ;-)"
5,Works great in ESXi 4.1.,"I picked up one of these for use in a VMware ESXi 4.1 virtual server and it works beautifully. It is a PCI-x (not to be confused with PCIe) card, but it will also function in a normal 32-bit PCI slot. There have been some reports of these cards only registering one network port in ESXi. However, this was not my experience. Upon install, the system recognizes both ports with no issues at all. This is a great way to add multiple network ports to a system or server with limited space. I would buy again in a heartbeat."
1,Item delivered but not as advertised,I received this NIC today and was surprised to see that it was not in original packaging as indicated by the product picture. It also lacked a very vital component... the low profile bracket. I ordered this card to fit into a Micro-ITX case which requires the use of a low profile card. This is disappointing. The item description specifically states that it is low-profile compatible and includes the bracket. Amazon needs to add penalties for sellers who waste customers' time and money with items that are misrepresented. The system I'm building is for a time sensitive project and now there is an unnecessary delay because of this muck up.
5,Excellent!,"A great product, you can always trust Intel Network Adapters, I recommend it for anyone looking a reliable adapter for small servers or high-end workstations, specially is you have plans to use O/S like Linux."
4,Happy With It,I'm happy with it. I'm sure some are better quality but it works as good as I expected and would buy it again if I had need of another.
5,A Glittering Gem,"Even though this album received very mixed reactions, I still regard it as one of Neil Diamond's best efforts. Yes, it is over-produced, and yes, the lyrics are over-the-top and sung with a very awkward British accent, but all eight tracks are timeless classics. Beautiful orchestral arrangements, a brilliant sound and Diamond's voice sounding better than ever. I have owned two vinyl releases prior to replacing them with the CD version in the Mid-Eighties, and I still play the album frequently. The first four tracks are among the best work Neil Diamond has ever put to tape, and the soaring chorus of ""Lady Magedelene"" still gives me shivers after 26 years. 33 minutes of music is not much, but I agree with the reviewer who said that in this case quality really comes before quantity."
4,Very listenable,"I picked up Serenade on CD recently, after having had the my scratched vinyl copy for years. I had a feeling that this was worth having clean again, and I was right! Serenade is a richly textured studio album with very high quality recording, and all the better for it. Neil's singing voice is at a mature stage and shows no signs of roughness and strain that have come with his later recordings. It is very listenable over and again, and follows on the the reflective mood of JLS. Neil's material on this album is not generally in pop genre of his hits and so we don't see many of the songs translating into enduring live recordings (IBTWB excepted!). Serenade is sadly of short duration timewise, but it is an album of quality, not quantity."
4,Third installment,"He's injured, she his ""angel."" If you like a likeable H and a going against the flow h, this is one you may enjoy. If you like mystery (but can figure it out before the end) it's there. I enjoyed Ms Hern's unfolding of a love story minus the ultimate ""meeting."" Necking and foreplay is tantalizing...throw in miscommunication (how do they come together again?) and a duel and you come up with ""An Affair of Honor."" Enjoyable read if you are detail oriented.Third installment to...(1) ""A Proper Companion"" Robert and Emily, (2) ""A Change of Heart"" Jack and Mary and this one (3) ""An Affair of Honor"" Colin (""Sedge""wick) and Meg by Candice Hern."
4,Another Goodie,"I will eventually read all of Candice's Regency romances because they are so relaxing and enjoyable. Her characters are very predictable but what the heck, it's fun reading how it all comes together. Keep them coming Candice."
5,An Affair of Honor,"I loved it, and I knew that this would be a wonderful book to read. Thank you Candice for being such a wonderful author."
2,Just silly,"This book just didn't do much for me. The romance fell flat. I did like the main character, until she decided to change her morals. The leading man was ok, he just thought with the wrong end. The first of the book held great potential, but then everything got repetitive. This was clean because it had no explicit love scenes, but not clean because the main characters went beyond just kissing and the attributes of the leading lady were talked about often."
5,Excellent book to learn the 360 Degree Review system,"This book was very helpful in showing me the ins and outs of a 360 degree review system. Has the basic theory, how to implement the system, and ways t work around the resistance to change."
3,world champions on ice,out dated. I returned movie please credit my discovery card. you should think about better quality. thats all i have to say . I'll be looking for my credit thanks
5,Habre las puertas de muchos secretos...,"Aqui podremos con detalles como vivio Ralgha nar Hhallas el pase suyo del Imperio a la Confederacion. Nos muestra muy bien la mentalidad que tenian los gatos, sus votos de lealtad que por ningun motivo lo podian romper. Caracteristicas que los muestra como una raza muy dura y sometida a los superiores. Una raza de una sola voz, la del Emperador.Pero el que todos conocemos como ""Hobbes"" no es el unico personaje importante. Esta ""Hunter"", ""K'Kai"", ""Rikki"" entre otros. Que mas se puede decir, esta historia esta muy bien hecha. Hay accion a lo largo de toda la novela y ademas con una interacion muy bien hecha entre las situaciones que se viven en todos los bandos, sea la Confed, Imperio o en los Firekkans."
2,Upper body workout without warmup,"I agree with the editorial review. I would also add that he expects you to warm up first doing something else before putting in the tape. If you're going to spend this much total time anyway, Kathy Smith has a much more complete upper body workout which includes warmup, all upper body, abs, and cool down/stretch at the end."
4,"For Mac Users, It Really Is Plug & Go!","As a long time Mac user in a PC-product dominated world, I always twitch slightly when installing generic ""dual platform"" products. No need in this case -- I slapped one into an older G4 (Gigabit Ethernet model with an Powerlogix processor upgrade) running MacOS 10.4.7, fired up the machine, and boom 4 additional ports (5 if you count the internal one, which I'm gonna figure out something to do with), no fuss, no muss, no drivers or tweaking needed. Although I haven't tried any formal timing runs, reading files either directly from a digital camera or via a generic flashcard reader is very notably faster (why I installed the card in the first place) making this product a very good investment of $20."
3,Works - But,"Easy to install in a dual G5 Power Mac, no drivers required. The card works fine with OS 10.4.8, but the computer will not go into Sleep Mode if a disk drive is connected to this card (including iPods). The drives will sleep, but not the Mac. The computer will sleep fine if my scanner, card reader (without card) and IR remote are plugged into this card. Also, if you plug your keyboard into the card, you can't wake the computer because the card is ""sleeping"". I checked the ADS website and there are no fixes for the sleep issues. If you can work around the quirks, the card does work."
1,Does not work on G5,Nothing else to really state here....said it worked on a G5...it does not. It was so cheap that I cannot return or restock it without losing more money so now I have a useless PCIX card
4,ADS USB 2.0 upgrade,Very straight forward to install and use. No surprises but a tight fit in the PCI slot requires a little more force that one would normally expect.
4,USB 2 add-on,"I put this card into my 2001 G4 quicksilver, largely to accomodate my daughter's new iPod touch.It dropped right in, I did install some tiny bit of software from the Cd just to be thorough.It works perfectly. The iPod liked it, the cameras like it, it is a very worthy item to install in a computer that is pre-USB 2.I already had the D-Link hub and that plugged right in and works just great with it too.All in all, this is well worth the 20-25 bones just to plug in the iPod. A very good deal."
5,Great upgrade from USB 1,"This is a great card. My old G4 Mac only had USB 1. What a speed difference. I love having the four USB 2 ports. I needed more so I got a USB 2 hub which hasn't seemed to affect the speed any. I can use multiple devices without any problems (ie: iPod and scanner at the same time). I don't know what use the internal USB port is, but I'm sure there must be some use for it."
1,Worked randomly for about 2 weeks,I installed this on my mac duel g4 tower. it worked randomly for about 2 weeks.
2,Meh,"I added this product to a Dell running Windows 2000. The CD was supposed to automatically popup with a screen to install the necessary drivers, but it did not. I couldn't even figure out how to get the automated driver install to work at all. I manually installed the drivers off of the CD. The device works, but not at USB 2.0 speeds. My camera and MP3 player, the two USB2 devices that led me to get this, run at slow speeds. It does seem to have sped up my WiFi (I have a USB WiFi adapter), but not to USB 2.0 speeds. Basically, I got some additional USB1 ports with slightly faster internet."
4,Successful ADS USB 2.0 PCI Card,"Card installed and ran with no major hiccups within minutes of signing for it. Purchased card for iPod and it runs great. I don't know if there is an issue with the computer not sleeping with something plugged into it, can't say that I have put it in such a situation. I also do not use it to plug in a mouse or keyboard, only peripherals. Mac 10.4.11 2x800mhz G4."
5,Amazing renditions of O'Carolan tunes,"Kirtley, national fingerstyle guitar champion, gives magnificent arrangements of many Turlough O'Carolan standards such as ""Shi Beg Shi Mhor"" as well as those of his own. Easy listening, I could play it all day and not get tired. You don't have to be into Irish tunes to appreciate and enjoy this CD. None better. Sadly, he has not published many CDs."
4,pattern recognition in engineering,Fukunaga is a standard source for pattern recognition methods often cited in the engineering literature. Covers parametric (particularly linear and quadratic discriminant algorithms) and nonparametric methods (density estimation). It is designed for and popular with engineers. When I was working at Nichols Research Corporation Fukunaga's papers and this book (earlier edition) were often cited as sources to justify the algorithms we used for discrimination problems. In fact Fukunaga had been a consultant to the company (used primarily by the Boston branch of the company where the KENN algorithms were developed). It is a reputable source. I still like Duda and Hart (1973) for good explanations of the fundamental concepts. The second edition that was recent ly published with Stark as a third author is also highly recommended. For statisticians McLachlan's book is now far and away the best source.
1,Not worth it.,This crab meat has pieces of shell and has very little flavor. I could have gotten this same quality at the Wal-Mart store for a lot less then 2.35 per can. Will not order again!
1,This is the STUPIDEST book I've ever bought on Amazon,"I bought this book because the reviews were so favorable, but sure wish I hadn't!!! Its incredibly stupid and a waste of money. Unfortunately, its been over a month or I would return it! Unless you like making finger puppets that look like butts, DON""T BUY IT!"
4,Interesting but could be improved with food photos.,"I enjoyed this romp through gastronomic etymology. But the publisher should have printed in a more readable type-face, included pictures of the foods discussed, and edited out some of the redundancies. Also, the footnotes are too small to read easily, and much too detailed. It runs between a scholarly work and a Martha Stuart Living magazine. But I look forward to anything else written by Barnette, and I will devour it as I did this book (so to speak)"
2,It Could Have been better!!,"I needed a used Spinpoint drive in order to harvest a couple of parts to repair a damaged drive that I own.I did not yet complete the job but after I ordered the Hard Drive and paid for it, the seller then contacted me andinformed me that the item was damaged and that he had no other drives of that type. Obviously I needed that specific drive, and so I decided to accept the damaged drive as the parts that I needed were intact. However I can never use the drive, and so I would rate this purchase as unsatisfactory. The key thing is that those drives are no longer made and acquiring a new one is difficult and almost as difficult to secure a used one."
4,Essential Puppet History,"Catriona Kelly provides vital information about Russian puppet history. If you are a person looking for help recreating antique puppet traditions, this book belongs in your library. Despite the Soviet Union's attempt to quash or sanitize the Petrushka tradition, what little evidence remains has been gathered and presented by the author along with portions of remaining scripts. The book is full of revelations and surprises."
1,When accountants and soldiers take interest in geometry.....,"One day, accountants and soldiers may take an interest in differential geometry. If and when such a day comes to pass, this book will have a role to play. Until then, engineers, physicists and mathematicians alike have better alternatives, such as the inspiring texts, with complementary qualities, by Burke, ""Applied Differential Geometry""; by do Carmo, ""Riemannian Geometry"", or by Spivak, ""A Comprehensive Introduction to Differential Geometry"".Even more advanced books such as Lang's or Petersen's are more readable: in them the extra formalism brings the reward of more powerful results. Here the retentive attention to the trees at the expense of the forest is merely a barrier to entry for the uninitiated. This text's popularity in some areas of engineering must have played a role in the slow acceptance of Riemannian geometric methods.Manuel Tenide"
5,KEEP SWINGIN' THAT SOUND,"TRAPEZE IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE ONE OF THE BEST KEPT SECRETS. SO MUCH TALENT AND SO LITTLE TIME TO RECORD. TRAPEZE WILL LIGHT UP YOUR SOUL AND DELIVER A SOUND THAT HAS NEVER BEEN REMANUFACTURED IN THE STUDIO.GREAT MUSIC,GREAT VOCALS -BUY IT NOW!"
5,Need more information,"Am interested in the 40 Great Country Classics, however your information is sketchy and only gives 3 track listings. I am interested in the titles in this set and the artists of each. Thanks"
4,It's tight work.,"To be honest a lot of this stuff has been spun in many Dj mix's but overall and since Eric is my buddy, this is a good CD to get if you are into the bassy breakbeat/electro funk. Breakbeat lovers will like this mix."

5,A Masterpiece!!!,I love this album. This is a great listen from start to finish. Sheryl Crow at her best! A must buy!
5,The best Sheryl Crow CD you can find!,"I first listened to this album on cassette tape (which obviously dates it!), but it's one of those albums where every song is a good one. I can listen to the whole thing without skipping a track. It will not disappoint if you like rock & roll/alternative mixed with pop. I think this album is her best.. oldie but goodie!"
4,She's the gal that only she can be on this...,"After a successful debut album, there's the urge to blossom out and express one's soul more deeply. That's what Sheryl's done here, and she reveals a larger range than she did on her first album, a much deeper, rather darker, and diversified set here.""Maybe Angels"" gets the set started here, and then the rather pointed ""A Change Would Do You Good"" with some pretty driving lyrics. Sheryl's work on the guitar & keyboards comes out well here too.We go into a darker world with ""If It Makes You Happy"", one that fits with the cover. No, that cover doesn't make her goth. It shows something deeper, a hardness maybe under her natural beauty...not a hardness that hurts but a hardness that protects.""Everyday Is A Winding Road"" is another winner here.All in all, this second album of hers definitely fulfilled the promise of her first."
5,Sheryl can really relate to normal people...,"I really like the tunes on the cd, and so does my forty-year-old mother! That shows that Crow's songs really get to people."
2,I really did not like this album,"The only reason why I listen to this CD is because of ""If it makes you happy"",""Everyday is a Winding Road"",and ""A Change Will Do You Good"". The album was sooo disappointing because it is nothing like ""Tuesday Night Music Club""."
3,Good/ Bad Day for Sheryl Crow,"Sheryl Crow has made a big name of herself but this cd is not the best she is capable of. With only one good song on the album,"" If it makes you happy"" the rest are pretty much not worth listening to. I recommend to Sheryl to make a single!"
4,WAY better than i expected!,"the only reason i bought this was because my best friend loves sheryl crow and i was surprised to find out what a beautiful voice she has,i really would of given this a 4 and a 1/2.My favorite song is #3,""home"",if you buy this cd you definitley will not be disappointed!"
5,Absolutely Brilliant!,"What more can I say about this great album. It only took one listen and I was hooked.There is honestly not one weak song on this entire album. The boppy numbers such as ""Everyday is a winding road"", ""A change"" and ""Sweet Rosalyn"" are my favourite tracks, but the ballads are just as good.This music is perfect to study to, perfect to work to and perfect to pull out your guitar and strum along. What are you waiting for... Go out and get it now!!!"
5,Still the best Sheryl Crow,"This was the first Sheryl Crow CD I purchased and I was hooked on her music. I have all of her studio CDs now, but I think this CD is the best one. Every song is unique. It reminds me of the Classic Rock I grew up with and ranks up there with the best. Her other CDs have one or two songs that are good, but this CD is loaded with great songs."
5,"A Funning, Grooving, and Bopping Ecstacy","Not like I really know what ecstacy is supposed to be anyways, but this album certainly puts you in the euphoric mood where you wouldn't care! 'Change' is a sure moodlifter and 'Home' is perfect as its complement to inject a little reality into life. Playfullness parried with harsh realities is the best way to described Sheryl Crow. Every coin has two sides and music that shows just one of those sides doesn't fit into the scheme of things. Sheryl's music definitely fits and she's set for a bright future.I wouldn't necessarily call the album grittier or poetry. Its definitely no concept album and the cuts don't relate much to each other except in style. The songs are meant to individually take you on a ride - and when the album's done you wanna get back in line and do it over again!May take a while to grow on you - since her style is unique. The good part is that its enjoyment is not short-lived; I've been enjoying it for a year now.Highly Recommended!!"
1,Bland!,This is the most overrated album I've ever heard. There is not an origanil song on here. I'm sooo disappointed.
4,Wonderful addition to school curriculum!,We have used the Transition Mathematics book at our school in 6th grade. The content explores different approaches to standard math exercises while maintaining an engaging foundation of math fundamentals. This is a wonderful book and has fit perfectly with the rest of our curriculum. Good job!
2,not so great,"this volume really is a disappointing one! too many dull and boring tracksif this is your first time giving the dream dance series a chance, stay away from this one and try volume 20 rather. That's one of my favourite!"
2,First Dream Dance CD,I wish I had read the reviews. But like any of these types of cds they put a few good songs to bait you. Seems like a lot of filler. They include a mixer software that mixes from one song to the next but that's only good if your using the computer. Why didn't they just mix it originally is beyond me. There are better to be had.
5,Good Book,"Great overview of MPLS, good way to study, recommended read for anyone interested in understanding more about scaling large networks."
3,Good Challenge but.....,"First of all this puzzle is a challenging one, kept me glued to it for about a week and a half, to fit this pieces is challenging so it keeps you on your toes, is as good as watching an action flick.... However the quality of this puzzle is something that needs to be addressed, when you look at the puzzle in a ""horizontal low Profile"" all the pieces sits unevenly, in other words, when the puzzle is done and you touch the puzzle you can feel all the bumps and somehow this pieces do not sit flat. I have done quite a few puzzles in my lifetime but this is the worst one as far as aesthetics goes. So if you do not care for those little ""bumps"" then by all means go ahead and get ready for a challenge. Good Luck!"
1,Not usable for iPod,"I did not purchase this item from Amazon, but after having trouble with installation, I checked here to see if others were having trouble. I also purchased this item to make iPod syncing faster. Each time I connect the iPod through this device, the laptop locks hard. My Windos XP system is fully up to date, and I checked for driver updates, and that was no help. I can run a mouse and inkjet printer through this device, but not an iPod."
1,Beware!,"Contrary to Amazon's claim this product does not support Windows 98, but only Windows 98 SE and later. This was verified with the Manufacturer, whose package description says so also.Had to return product to Amazon because of misleading product description, by Amazon."
1,pay ... more and get a real machine,"You get exactly what you pay for wifh this. The thread tension is a real problem. I couldn't stitch chiffon at all- it kept snagging and bunching up. The foot pedal is so poorly made, I was nervous pressing on it.I'd rather sew by hand than fight with this .... Do yourself a favor- don't be cheap, buy a real machine."
1,I hate it,I have had nothing but problems with it. I am continuosly rethreading both the upper bobbin and botom bobbin. My bigest problem with it is that it misses stitching and I'll only get2-3 big stitches how are you suppose to do anything with that?as far as I am concerned the advertisments for this machine are wrong and I think it was a waste of my money and other customer's money to. and there is absolutly no speed control or stitch control as advertised.very unhappy
1,I decided to return it on the first day.,"I bought this item because I was not going to do hard or complicated job with the sewing machine and I didn't need a big one for my simplest jobs. But, this item was not fit for even a simple straight stiching with a linen. I wasted my time with this unreliable machine."
2,Lost foot pedal,I bought a euro-pro machine for my eight year old. The foot pedal is not in the box and I have been trying for two weeks to order a new one. The number for the product is busy always and they are not very helpful. She can't use the product without the accessory that is missing. Someone please help me. The internet is not helpful either. Please give me some useful advice on where to get this missing part. thank you cathy yerbich
4,Great solution for guys,"I was very pleased with this little sewing machine. I'm a guy, and I know nothing about sewing, except that I was tired of sewing little holes in my clothes by hand. I didn't want to spend a bunch of money on a big, fancy machine. This one is pretty basic, and there are a couple places where the instructions could've been clearer. But after sewing up a hole in some pants within 10 minutes of opening the box, I felt very happy with my purchase."
1,similar machines do not work!,"I have an even smaller version of this machine and it has completely stopped working after just two days. I will be returning it to target TODAY. If I were you, I would not buy any sewing machines or sewing products from this brand. Not a good investment!"
1,waste,I can't imagine anyone getting any use out of this--it was flimsy and impossible to get to work.
1,NOT GOOD,"I tried your sewing machine, and honestly I was very dissapointed. The 1st time I used it got stuck and jamed, and I will be taking it back to the Store for a refund, I only bought it so I did not have to bring out my big machine, but I should have known better It does not even do SMALL jobs properly at least there should have been some way that you could un jam it I know that it is not expensive but for little jobs it should have worked Thank you"
1,"Shameless liars, false advertising","These shameless liars state on the box ""Durable metal gear for long time use"".I open it up because it would not work properly - all cheap plastic gear.Besides that they supplied power adapter with wrong polarity which caused the machine to go in the opposite direction.What a garbage!!!"
1,"Grossly inferior construction, poor quality","I purchased this sewing machine to make simple, rapid alterations on some of my cheaper clothing. I have very limited experience with sewing, but figured that an inexpensive sewing machine would be a good investment.Unfortunately, the Euro-Pro sewing center was very disappointing, and completely failed to meet my expectations. The machine was subject to frequent jams, had a weak motor and a poorly designed electrical system, and it was very difficult to make proper adjustments to tension the thread correctly. I managed to make several seams, but the stitching was quite uneven. In conclusion, I was very disappointed with this device, and have returned it for a refund. I would not recommend purchase of this device except for the most trivial of tasks, and even then I would seek a second opinion."
1,don't buy cheap stuff,"I recieved this sewing machine as a gift and it arrived broken. my husband spent the night trying to get it to work, and finally gave up after he realized that the problem was internal.( it kept clicking) finally he got it to work and tried to sew a piece of cloth but the thread wouldn't come out, then the bobbin became loose and the machine froze and wouldn't work. If you are looking for a sewing machine you are better off buying a better quality machine- spend the extra $$ and get a working machine"
1,Jam central...,"I'm fairly petite and thus have been forced to learn how to hem and alter clothing at an early age- I bought this item figuring it'll do for simple hemming projects. BOY WAS I WRONG...right off the start, the threading kept jamming up. When I called customer support, they made it sound like I was the one who couldn't use this three-button machine. After a few hours and massive seam ripping to redo and undo the threading and trying out different fabrics- I threw up the white flat and returned it to Amazon. THANK HEAVENS I bought it from Amazon, the return was simple & painless."
4,Use your own thread,"I don't believe this unit deserves all the negative reviews that it has gotten. Much to my delight this gizmo was able to do basic sewing after a bit of practice on my part. It is capable of sewing light fabrics using the materials provided. For heavier fabric like pants, you really need to use your own thread. Otherwise, it's useless. As another poster noted, you might want to buy your own needles as well, though I haven't tried that. This unit paid for itself after I hemmed three pairs of pants! Not bad for an absolutely basic sewing machine."
1,May be good if ......,"I bought this unit almost a year ago to do some home deorating. Throw pillows - vallences, etc. I had not gotten around to it till now.The one think I noticed is that the power plug had to be rotated to actually power the unit. So there may be something wrong with that design. But my biggest problem is when I bought it I took out the instructions to read. I lost those instructions. And now have having a very hard time with it.I cant get the unit to sew with out having the thread bunch up in the underside of the fabric, and then clog.I was hoping to find a user manual on line - but there does not seam to be one. That would be a great help for most of us out there who for one reason or another, don't have it any longer.Judging by my limited use with this item, I have to say I am disabpointed.Thank You"
2,"2 needles broke, jammed","I got this over 2 years ago, and stuck it in my closet after i couldn't get it to work. I decided to give it another try, and took it out. Finally after messing with the bottom bobbin, it finally operated. I was so excited! So I tried using it today, and somehow the needle bent while I was sewing a pillow case - nothing too thick. I saw that the needle broke. So I took that off, and read the instructions to ""clamp"" the needle in. Did that - while I was tightening the needle clamp, the cheap plastic clamp cracked! I wasn't exerting much force. I didn't notice the crack until I began sewing with the 2nd needle they give you, and then it got jammed again! Since the needle wasn't broken, I don't think there is a way to get the needle out, that is stuck in the bottom bobbin, other than to break it. So I broke it, and have a broken needle clamp as well. Any suggestions to get a replacement part for this thing?"
4,A Great Book for Troubled Times,"Father Dave Heney has written a great book for difficult times. It is a bridge over troubled waters. Catholics will get the most out of it for it clarifies with clear and apt examples helping them understand the conflicts. However all people of faith will profit from reading it because it gives clear guide lines to help us understand important moral issues. Personally I appreciated his starting with his cards on the table. Morality consists of Equality, Freedom,Goodness,and finally Service to others. The author says, ""Most likely, we will never be sinless or perfect in our life but we can atleast be honest about it."" The book's great virtue, to cover all the moral dilemmas, may be its biggest fault no one including the reviewer will agree totally with his take on each issue. Isn't that the trouble in all moral questions. We agree in general and disagree in particular. So much depends on context."
2,A head-scratcher,"Shames manages to take one of the simplest mechanics courses ever and turn it into rocket science (that's not until next semester....). Even taking the class taught by the author himself, I remain baffled most of the time. The book has moments of clear language, but manages to leave out key details about necessary topics. There are more than enough examples, but he manages to skip and combine so many steps and methods, it can only leave a student puzzled. Leave this text for the study of theory, but use something else for applications."
5,Fantastic hisorical adventure novel!!!,"This book is the keystone for a superb series of historical fiction novels focused around frontier times in Central Pennsylvania. It introduces you to many indian and colonial characters that you really get to know as friends and foes. If you like reading about frontier times with indian battles and inventive settlers this is the book for you. It is right up there with classics like ""The Last of The Mohicans"" and if it were made into a movie would blow away ""Dances with Wolves"". Once you finish this book you'll find yourself looking for as many of Mr. Chandler's stories that you can get your hands on.Terrific!"
3,Interesting read,"This book, although it contains some graphic violence reads like it should be in an high school library. His style doesn't really capture the imagination but is interesting from an historical point of view."
3,A little disappointed and surprised,"It really is not a birdhouse, it's cute but is non functional. It was a gift for my daughter in law, we were both disappointed."
4,Cute,"Some of the animals weren't glued on,that is the only problem with it. Very nice and looks just like picture."
1,Not even close to the picture shown!,"My friend and I run a preschool called Noah's Ark, so we are always looking for new ""ark"" related items to display. I was very excited when I saw this adorable birdhouse and couldn't wait to have it as a Christmas gift for our classroom. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box to discover a colorless, birdhouse covered in so much moss that you couldn't even see the structure. The item delivered to me is a sad representative for the one pictured in the photo. I am relatively crafty so I have opted to keep the item so that I can fix it to my liking. However, for anyone who wants to order the object shown in the photo...forget it and look elsewhere!"
2,you get what you pay for....,"1. its not a bird feeder- no place for birds or seed all blocked off2. can not go out doors- the material would get destroyed, and the paint would come off3. horrible packing- got it in a box with 2 holes in it, i open it to find out that there's no packing that was shipped along with it so the boat ends ripped threw the box.so over all its not bad but it promised a little more than what was received."
4,Review of Noah's Ark birdhouse,"The birdhouse looks as described and I am pleased with it. The packaging could have been much better--the large giraffe had come loose from the base (I repaired with glue), a lot of the moss came loose from the roof, and the box was a bit small (the front of the ark had broken through the box."
4,yo ho ho and a bottle of rum,"fairly good book about pirates, though it would have been nice to hear something about like a secret island, something about the secret life of pirates. a good book anyways, though"
5,"A brilliant, well-needed book","This is a simply tremendous book-a great blend of the techical and the informal-should be required reading not only for Speech and rhetoric but a large number of other college-level courses. The author has acadmic, parctical, and professional experience in a wide variety of areas, conventional and non-conventional, that few others can match. Also, at a great price!"
2,Good times,"Although these musicians come from great bands, and do a killer job in them; it shouldn't be the reason that sells them...Especially when the music sounds exactly like their counterparts intermingled. Bad Mannerism in Music, and sales, at its best ladies and gentlemen!"
4,A Fantastic Lecture on Matisse,"This a Fantastic Lecture on Matisse by Rosamond Bernier who knew Matisse personally. I really enjoyed hearing her anecdotes and seeing the slide presentation, which shows a lot of lesser known works. This is a DVD for real Matisse aficionados. It is also a touching social documentation of a beautiful cultured woman in her prime, talking about a topic she loves so well. The content is fascinating, the way it is delivered is even more interesting."
1,"Brilliant Performance, Abysmal Transfer","I was thrilled to finally see this recording (which has been part of my Christmas tradition on vinyl and CD-R) available for download.HOWEVER, the downloaded recording is wretched. It has more pops and clicks than my 45 year old record.Amazon should be ashamed."
5,Better Than Expected!,"Easy to use, meaningful, and provides a good amount of background info. If you are interested in doing the daily offices, you cannot go wrong with Tickle's book(s)."
4,Good!!,"I know some other reviewers mention it doesn't really follow the bcp, but it is still a really great collection to have in your library. The readings, morning, noon, night, and compline are short enough so that even the busies people can make time to pray.My only complaint is the language, I would have liked to have seen a more inclusive text, especially in some areas where it would have really been helpful. I think Mrs. Tickle would have a better following if the language was updated. It is this way in all 4 of her books (Divine Hours - 3 books, and then the Evening Prayers). If you are sensitive to the male dominated text of the bcp, you probably will not like this."
2,Disappointed.,"I waited a good three months for the release of this DVD and ordered it the very day it became available. The first DVD I received froze-up approximately one hour into the program. I tested it on three separate DVD players, and the program froze in the same place on each deck. I immediately returned the DVD for a replacement; which Amazon handled promptly and efficiently. The second DVD arrived within a few days, but unfortunately this DVD would not load at all on any of the three DVD players I own. For $40 I expect more from a product.As for the program itself . . . the portion I was able to watch, the information was very basic and common sense stuff. I admit, the information I was most interested in was scheduled for the latter half of the program which I was never able to see, so I can't fairly comment on that.I am returning the 2nd defective DVD for a refund."
1,"Cheap, wouldn't buy again",Purchased for my three year old son. He missed the ball hit the ground ANDthe putter head snapped off five minutes out of the packaging. If I had to do it again I'd buy the Little Tikes or another plastic set. I though the metal would hold up better.
1,"good at first, broke too soon","The iron was great at first, did a wonderful job, and saved alot of time. But then it broke, steam wouldn't come out and the handle became too hot to hold. We repaired it ourselves and found that the internal steam hose had broken. It worked for a short while but quickly broke again after about 3 uses. Reaching ANYONE at the Euro-pro company for help was frustratingly impossible, and their available parts and services were not sufficient to help with my problem. I would never buy ANY product from Euro-pro ever again. Customer service is extremely poor."
5,Euro Pro EP8002 Steam Generator Iron,"I found that the intructions are alittle unclear. It doesn't tell you how much water to add at first, and there is no guage. Kind of hard to tell, and if you fill too much you have to pick it up and dump out the water. I think it would be helpful to have a way to know if you are overfilling. The iron itself is fantastic. Makes ironing fun. Takes out alot of ironing time. I love it! I ironed my entire wardrobe the first week!"
2,Euro Pro Steam Generator Iron,"I was euphoric over my iron before it started to leak fom the base and the handle got too hot to hold. I thought maybe the problem with my 18-month old iron was just a fluke until I heard from my daughter today and she described the same problem with her Euro Pro Steam Generator Iron...the only difference was that hers is less that 4 months old!! It's a wonderful iron, if you don't mind replacing it every year or less...much less!!!! I have never spent THAT much money on an iron to have it fail so soon!!"
3,I don't know what to say,"I did enjoy the book overall, but there were a few things that got in the way of fully taking advantage of the writers superb literary skills.1. There was too much going on! It was over here, over there! It was everywhere. The charachter thoughts move like people change underwear...it worked and it didn't work.2. Was it me...or did Maverick get done in the bonghole?I liked the book. As a hetereosexual male, this has definately rasied my awareness about gay men and it has most definately changed my perception for the better. I walked away with a complete understanding, which I felt depicted the homosexual lifestyle in a real and accurate way. I believe that this book has a great promise to do extremely well. I am glad to say that I embrace this brothas life and others I will come in contact with."
3,"Beautiful song, but?","This song has got to be one of the most overrated songs of the 90's. Why do I proclaim such a thing?Extreme has a world of songs there on all of their albums. So it's ashame that the band is only known for this song. By the masses of course.Extreme was a daring band. Whose sound varied album by album. They liked to challange their fans and the listener. ""More Than Words"" proves that to the listener. This? from a rock band?But this song was not the most abstract work from the band. It was songs like ""When I First Kissed You"" and ""God Isn't Dead"" that showed Extreme's diversity. But it was ""Everything Under the Sun"" from ""3 Sides to Every Story"" that showed Extreme's musical creative drive the most.By far one of the most musically daring and weird rock bands of the 90's.Taken things to musical Extreme's."
3,Shipped wrong item,I ordered a an API-310 but received an API-311 which has no software. I should have returned the item for credit but dithered for 40 days.
1,Too Narrow to have comfort - Size run smaller than normal,"This style is not designed for people who have wide feet. If you prefer comfort, please don't think to order them. Too narrow to put your feet on, even, you order your right size. Size run small. You have to order one bigger size than your actual size in order to fit on. I don't recommend this style to other customers. Very uncomfortable to wear."
3,"Good value, some functional issues, good watch","I wanted something inexpensive that was easy to read for general purpose use that would work for business attire. I did get that. The watch seems fine. The dial face is nice and the Indiglo backlight is good. It was extremely frustrating to set the date initially. It will easily change one or two stays to accomodate months less than 31 days, but changing many days took me hours to futz with. The date display is also very tough to read due to the strange font and large number in a small hole."
4,Purchased as gift,"Bought this as a gift for my father - he likes the simple watches and two-toned to go with everything. Easy to use, easy to see. He really seems to like it."
1,not as shown,I have a golf ball holder that looked just like the one I was purchasing with the little man in the circle. But when I received the new one the man in the circle did not match so I was not happy. I wanted it to match the one I had. What a let down.
1,"Not The One I Ordered,","Noy only did I not recieve the cabinet I ordered, ""The One That Is Pictured""I was sent one of VERY POOR Quality. The craftsmanship is terrible.I lost my money on this one, to big of a hassle to send back."
1,Wasn't the same product as pictured,"What I ordered...twice...was a cabinet with a decorative feature as the top (shown in the photo when I ordered it). Once the product was shipped from Fogdog (return of the incorrect product was easy & successful)..second time it shipped to us via Amazon (again, return of the incorrect product was easy & successful)...it's just annoying that I can't get the cabinet I wanted (& which was pictured."
3,Why? Response,"We buy these cases to show course logo balls from courses that we have been to. We also include balls such as ""wounded warrior project volunteer"" to show things we have done. It is a decoration that every golfer admires and it also stirs conversation. Collecting great golf balls is a hobby; collecting 49 soccer balls, really? Don't be ignorant. Thanks!"
1,Why?,"Why in the world would you want to display your golf balls? Really come on, this is just silly!!! Maybe if your a Pro and you just won that big huge tournament with that 1 wining ball, OK I can see you showing that one off and a single ball type display, but a 49 ball cabinet? You don't just toss your balls in the golf bag and go golf? How about a 49 Football rack, a 49 Soccer Ball rack, I could go on. This is just making garbage for the simple fact people will buy anything whether you actually need it or not."
4,THey are nice!,"They are nice for someone that is an ALabama Fan. THey help to decorate the interior of the car, they are not heavy they are just perfect."
5,subtle shade of pink,This shade of pink is very subtle and natural-looking. I highly recommend it for a polished elegant look. Great for french manicures!
2,To light!!,The nail polish was to light. The picture is very different than what I received. I gave it to my daughter and she liked it.
5,Cute and light color!,Love this neutral. It is very light and natural and goes great with everything. I put black and brown leopard over it and its gorgeous!
4,Pretty nude pink,"I saw my biology teacher wearing this color a few months ago and just had to have it. I've only worn it once since then but I like it. It gives your nails a clean, chic look. I just wish it wasn't so sheer though."
3,The Real Deal?,"I have used this product and this same shade of OPI polish for quite sometime now and because I had run out and was unable to get to a salon, decided to purchase it thru here. It goes on like OPI but somehow has more pink than the previous bottles that I have purchased from salons. I'm not sure if this means it is a knock off or maybe just a different batch.Overall it works just as well, its just a slightly different shade."
3,Just OK,"I wanted to like this polish so much but it just didn't flatter my nails or hands. It was so super sheer that I had to put about 6 to 7 coats on. After that, it looked better but it really didn't grab me like a fabulous polish should. Then it started to chip off because I had so many coats on -- ugh! I'm an Essie girl and I think mademoiselle or ballet slippers is a better bet than this. Disappointing -- oh well..."
5,Relaxation at it's best,When I was having chemo therapy I would wake up after a couple hours of sleep and not be able to go back to sleep because of anxiety and my mind racing. I got this cd and listened and almost instantly I was asleep. I just ordered it for my friend who has just started chemo. I have faith it will relax her.
2,Dull,"Truthfully, I found this boring. Still, it must have relaxed me because I sat there watching it not caring that there was a lot of nothing happening. A deaf garbageman finds a broken surf board. He takes it home and fixes it. When it breaks, he buys a good new one. By the end of the movie he can surf and is accepted by the other surfers.Oh, and a deaf woman his age follows him around in the ""correct"" 10 paces (or how many steps behind that's proper in Japanese culture) behind him throughout the film.Even The background music was unexciting but peaceful. New age/Windham Hill stuff.In my opinion, it's not worth getting unless you use it to try to sleep."
3,Interesting little film,"Great visuals make this one a real treat, although its not in the same vein as Kitano's yakuza films. As in all of Kitano's work, here he manages to blend all elements of filmmaking: direction, scoring, editing, etc. into a compelling work that is light on plot but nonetheless captures a myriad of emotions."
2,Levitating Blood?,I'm very disappointed in this product. The picture on the website is misleading in my opinion. When I unpacked the head from the container I noticed immediately that the blood surrounding the head curled up like the brim of a hat almost the entire way around. I tried placing weights on it and even used clothes pins to make it lay flat but nothing made even the slightest improvement. It looked like the blood was levitating around the edges from the head. Eventually I trimmed the rubber with a scissors in the most offending places but the effect was still the same. LAME!
3,Bicycle planter garden sculpture,"This was just what we wanted for whimsy in our new garden. The planters are ample and brightened the entrance to our garden all summer. It is sturdy and has withstood snow, sleet, hail, rain, major wind and gusts and whatever Mother Nature has thrown at it this winter. There is no rust or scum growth and the exterior surface remains clean. We look forward to this season with new plants and a smile every time we see it."
5,Extremely Interesting,"I have neer been able to meditate without getting a headache or going to sleep...until now. I was watching this product on my TV this week and suddenly realized I was in a meditative space with my eyes open! It was amazing. I felt so relaxed, comfortable, safe and in control. Of course once my mind caught on to what was happening I was no longer in the meditative space, but I now know what it feels like and will use this fantastic product as my tool to relaxation and who knows what terrific insights await me.Thank you so much for making this possible for me."
2,Tooo Slooooow......,"These are traditional Sacred Geometry patterns animated to colorful death to a so-so soundrack. Monroe Institute's Metamusic has never been a favorite of mine. Jeffrey Thompson would have been so much better.The images would be great if they intermixed, morphed from one to another, varied their sizes, multiplied, and generally evolved much faster. Instead what you get is image one changing colors, disappearing, and getting redone, all by the numbers (color 1, color 2...), slowly and for a looooooooong time. Then you get image two..... same thing. Then you either fall asleep; or decide to get up to make sure the grass is growing properly on your neighbor's front lawn."
4,"quite nice, but quality control issues","I very much enjoyed the sacred geometry visuals and soundtrack (Higher), but for some reason the audio and visual tracks do not sync up on my copy when viewed in wide screen mode with the first few minutes of visuals having a silent audio track. It's not really a big deal, but I would have been able to give five stars if this was corrected. I contacted the Monroe Inst. and they said that the problem does not occur on the new DVD."
1,NOT Happy!,Just purchased this juicer today and only ran about 12 carrots through it and it quit working. It just stopped. I got maybe 15 oz. of juice and that was it. I have let it cool down and it still won't work...
4,Had to send back to manufacturer for repair,"I enjoyed the juicer while it worked, but I think its claims of being able to juice whole apples are rather lofty. The second time I did this, the motor burnt out and I've had to send it back to the manufacturer for replacement. Up until that time, it seemed to work pretty well. Though I only juiced citrus fruits, carrots and apples so far. Hopefully they'll replace it swiftly."
5,"Easy to clean, and pretty dry.","I just got this today, and i have already juiced 10lbs of apples, 5lbs of oranges, 1 melon, and 1lb of carrots. its held up to the best of my expectations so far!!I love how it gives you the idea to use a produce bag that you get free from the grocer to put over the pulp container...that way all you have to do is lift out the bag and you dont have to clean up any of the pulp container!!the only thing i would say is that of the fruit i did, the orange pulp was still a lil wet, but not enough to be able to squeeze anything out of...produced about twice as much juice as my old manual citrus press...and in about 1 tenth of the time!!!excelent juicer, i just hope it continues to hold up to my expectations..."
4,Good Machine.,My wife prefers fresh juice and after watching a TV commercial for some juicer we did some research. The one on TV is a piece of junk (no surprise). We ordered this machine thinking it was made in Austrailia. It's made in China. The quality is high. The machine does everything as advertised though it takes some time to clean and there is no easy way to get everything off the bladed surface plate since by it's nature (sharp) a sponge is torn up. Other than that it's #1 in our book.
2,5% of these are defective,"I was in love with this juicer after having used it twice. Unfortunately, during the third use, it just died. I called Breville and they basically said 'send it to us, we'll try to fix it and if we can't, we'll send you a replacement'. I asked how many of these die like mine did and they said 5%! They also refused to give me a refund and I'm not sure if I want to wait a few weeks to get another one that may die also. Amazon customer service was a little more helpful, they agreed to send me a new one right away and gave me 30 days to return the bad one. If I was on the market looking for a juicer, I'd probably pick another brand."
1,Broke on arrival x 2,"Factory-Reconditioned Breville XXJE95XL Two Speed Juice Fountain PlusI was extremely excited when i ordered this juicer. However upon unpacking the item, i noticed a chipped piece of the surround plastic piece that separates the juice from the pulp tray was broken. I returned the item to amazon which promply shipped me another recondioned juicer. THis time i didnt have to open i could see the same chip in the same spot as last time. I beleive it has to be a design flaw or maybe the way the machine is packaged for shipment puts to much pressure on this piece. It looks like a beefy strong machine but i am not going to take a chance on recieving a third machine."
5,Breville JE95XL Two-Speed Juice Fountain Plus,"This is a great product! I had heard of problems with the motor and was a bit worried, and admittedly I have not owned it for long, but so far it works just as advertized."
5,breville,"I got it right before Xmas, so the shipment was fast. It works very well, less noisy than my previous one, more juice, less trash, easy to clean."
1,2nd use motor burn,"Man, I am soooo bummed. Second juice and the motor burned. Taking it back to macy's tomorrow. I hope they refund.(still have box/receipt) I read the review about the design flaw/reset button and I agree because I followed directions for beets and within 2 minutes it just died. But if there was a reset button this wouldn't have happened. It's really a bummer because it held so much healthy promise. I'll check on the other models but if you want to try this model, get it on super sale because I think that's where its headed."
5,Delicious juice AND quick clean-up!,"I just drank the first glass of juice from my Breville juicer and it delivered everything the other reviews promised. The model I bought has two speeds so I used the ""high"" setting to juice carrots, apples, and ginger. I had this same combination over the holidays from my sister's Jack LaLanne juicer but the juice from my Breville supassed it my a mile! I juiced whole apples, just as advertised. Those who are unable to do this are probably buying very large apples. Very clean taste, thanks to the froth separator. The juice output was what I expected and the pulp was dry. The clean-up was a snap - the plastic rinsed clean under warm water and the nylon brush provided did a great job cleaning the mesh filter basket. This in contrast with the Jack La Lanne product that requires a separate tool to unscrew the the filter. The Breville is highly recommended!"
1,Flawed motor--DON'T FALL FOR THE HYPE!,"I bought one of these ""top of the line"" juicers for my girlfriend. The second time she used it, the motor died. Okay, maybe it's just a fluke. I see some happy reviews out there and only a few people with this problem. So I get the replacement. She uses it a few more times, no problem. It sits for about a year and the first time she goes to use it again, boom--motor dies. Breville tech support is no help. No troubleshooting guides online. And the warranty is just one year--expired.Don't waste your money. Buy a different brand."
3,"Good juicer, but parts are deteriorating","I bought this juicer about two months ago now. While I like the ease of clean-up, the plastic parts have already become clouded and discolored. I was using it daily for a while, and always washing it out in soapy water. Sometimes now I just rinse it out with hot water. Lately, I use it maybe every other day. I'm hoping the plastic will hold up, at least till I pay it off! Other than that, it works fine, I make sure I don't let the motor run longer than the stated 4 minutes.Got mine from Bed, Bath, and Beyond, with a 20% off coupon."
1,Third use stopped working :(,"I loved this product the first 2 uses I got out of it, but then on the 3rd use (juicing seedless/stemless grapes) it just stopped working...mid-juice. I'm guessing it's the fuse (seeing that's what everyone else w/this model is having a problem with). I'm in the process of repairing it, but I'll have to take it to a small appliance shop to get it fixed, which is going to cost me about $40. Considering how much I paid for the machine you think they would hire someone to tell them you shouldn't put an 8amp fuse on a 850watt machine...duh! I'll be replacing mine with a 10amp fuse & hoping for the best.I agree w/other users- why in the world would they souder the stinking fuse in instead of putting a fuse holder in- that would make the repair SO SO SO much easier."
5,Nice machine,"This is the second juicer I have owned. The first was a Juiceman Juicer. Though the Juiceman served its purpose there is absolutely no comparison between the Juiceman Juicer and Brevilles. Brevilles Juice Fountain is far superior for less money. It is extrememly quiet, looks cool, has 2 speeds which really does come in handy, and is much more effecient. Less mess, less time spent juicing and a quick cleaup thanks to the smooth and rounded style design. Honestly I would rate it a 4.5 if it were possible on this website but because it is not, I rounded and gave it a 5. The reason I would give it a 4.5 is because I have noticed as others have stated here, that when juicing beets, there is a slight leakage issue around the pulp shoot area. Not really a biggie as it doesnt make a huge mess, but, it shouldnt leak. Other than that, it is an awesome juicer!"
5,great value,"This is a very good juicer that is the best value for money you will find. The motor is incredibly strong and doesn't blink an eye at beets, apples, whatever. Cleanup is easy too. You just have to make sure and put enough fruit/veg through the machine at once or it tends to dribble down the side of the machine after coming out of the spout. But not a major problem."
4,good as a back up,"I have this model and the top of the line stainless steel model. I alternate between the two. I prefer the stainless steel model because it has more power and is more of a solid machine. When I use the JE95XL, sometimes I can hear the motor slowing down when I put an apple in. It sounds like it is about to give out! With the stainless steel model, I never hear the motor slowing down. This juicer is good and I have had just about every kind of juicer on the market. If you can afford it - go ahead and get Breville's top of the line model - around $299."
4,Beats the bje200xl,"Got this for my wife for X-mas. I had previously bought her the BJE200XL. She hated the 200XL - noisy, difficult to clean, jumps when you turn it on, spills the juice... It was so bad the we even had a fight over it one time - it was so noisy that I bitched her out for waking me up with it - the only time I can say that we fought over an appliance. Well this model seems much, much better. Even on the high speed it is significantly quieter. Soft start keeps it from jumping when you turn it on. It is easier to clean. The mouth is wider so you can feed larger items in. Overall a nice improvement over the 200XL."
1,Dying motor,There is a reason Europe gets a 5 year warranty and the US only gets a one year warranty. Either Euopes laws a tougher on manufacturers or they know about this manufacturer. Motor design flaw allows over heating and instead of a cut off and re-set or thermostat breaker the unit burns out at the fuse.Try another model.
3,Loved it at first.,"I got this juicer about 3 weeks ago. I've used it 4 times. The 4th time the motor decided to quit, juicing apples. It just suddenly died. If not for that, I loved it. I especially loved the convenience of the large feed chute. Now I need to buy another juicer and I'm hesitating on getting another Breville. Will look into the JEXL800 and see if those motors tend to be more durable."
3,Stopped using it after a year,"After a year's of not heavy use, it's getting hard to take the machine apart and assemble it. The reason is a few accessories that hold the machine together do not function well anymore.Cleaning and drying the machine has always been a pain.I did enjoy the machine the first year."
5,This thing works...,This is the third juicer I have owned and the first one that really worked well. It's simple to assemble and use. It is not as loud as other reviewers have indicated. I highly recommend this machine. You will not be disappointed.
3,juicer,"When I was shopping for a juicer, I wanted the one that had more stainless steel instead of plastic. In the photo of this the grey plastic looked like metal. I have only used it a few times but it has rubbed the metal off in a couple of places, right above where the juice spout is shown. It works quickly but many times the greens don't juice but go whole into the bin for the scrapes of the veggies or fruits."
5,Breville JE95XL Two-Speed Juice Fountain Plus,I bought the Breville JE95XL Two-Speed Juice Fountain Plus for my daughter. This was a Christmas gift for her and she really loves it! She also bought the very same kind for her daughter. J. Hall
1,Nothing Happened,"Well it looks nice an all that but when we tried to turn it on nothing happened. I don't know why. They are sending us another one, they said. We will see. Really annoying."
2,Not reliable,"Bought it due to high recommendation. After using twice, the juicer is out of order. Very disappointed."
3,Untested,"By all accounts this is a good juicer. I chose it for the power, the easy clean pulp filter and the wide feed mouth. Then I moved to New York City where space is a premium and I just couldn't fit it in my little kitchen. I do believe it is a good juicer, but can't say from my own experience."
3,Not for the long haul,When I first obtained the juicer it performed without any flaws at all and thought I had puchased an item that would last me for years.This jucier had to be replaced within 60 days. During jucing a beet the big 850 watt motor just stopped as if it had been unpluged.Before this happened I had some problems such as pulp escapeing when using the high speed and sometimes juice was under the housing when I was through jucing.To this point this product has been disapointing except for the manufacturerr who has stood behind the product 100% with no hassel
3,Looks can be deciving.,"I had my Brevill JE95XL model for about 6 weeks. Overall I was quite happy with it until I tried to jucie carrots. The motor just died. I had read a review on this site stating that this had happend 3 times to one person, however, having seen that most of the reveiws were positive I decided to get one. Not too sure I did the right thing on reflection."
4,"So far, So good.","I received the Breville JE95XL Two-Speed Juice Fountain Plus as a gift for Christmas. Since then, I have used it once a day juicing carrots, apples, cucumbers, beets, celery, lemons, etc. My only qualm is that it doesn't yield that much juice from leafy greens, like spinach and parsley and sometimes I get veggie/pulp projectiles shooting at me when I try to put veggies down the chute. Even on low-setting. Clean-up is simple, as well. I do suggest a freezer bag for the pulp, though. Best product I have ever received to promote the healthy lifestyle I strive for."
5,"POWERFUL, EASY TO USE, EASY TO CLEAN,",years ago i had a juiceman (the $200 model). It was good. But this one is even better. Less waste out the back. sturdy. looks nice on the countertop. easy clean. very powerful (850 watts i think) compared to most around this price range. Good buy!
5,Best juicer of all time!,"This is the second juicer I have ordered. The Breville really gets the job done with minimal cleanup compared to other juicers. I raved so much about mine, I had to order one for my cousin."
5,Good Service & Product,I am very pleased with my Breville Juice fountain plus. It arrived on the date I was told it would. Thank you for your service and product. I would recommand the Breville to everyone. Carol Zirkelbach
2,juicer - too much work for the results,"The Breville juicer looked great(I ordered two as gifts), but it took a long time to assemble; took a long time to juice a minimal number of apples(2), and I suspect will take a really long time to clean and store. Consequently - returned both of the juicers to Amazon. Color me disappointed!"
4,Breville Juice Fountain,"Our family has truly enjoyed using the juice foutain. Great quality, does a fine job and in my opinion not very loud at all. I would recommend this product."
3,Breville juicer,"I AM HAPPY WITH THIS JUICER,ALTHOUGH I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO SEE LESS PULP RESIDUE LEFT OVER AFTER JUICING.IT'S FAST AND YOU CAN DROP WHOLE PIECES OF FRUIT OR VEGGIES INSIDE OF IT.I WOULD RECOMMEND IT."
3,"Great Performing Juicer, Short LifeSpan","Our Juicer died yesterday. Almost 2.5 years since we purchased it on Amazon. During its 2.5 years of service, we loved it. We used it 5-6 times a week and about 2 minutes per use to make 2 glasses of veggie/fruit juice in the mornings. I am extrememly disapointed that its life-span is so short. We always handled the unit with extreme care and never once was it abused. Yet, 2.5 years? I will not buy another Breville because of this quality issue as I've already replaced the unit with another brand (I have to admit, performance wise, Breville was #1)."
1,Juicer Died during the third session.,"I was able to get good juice out of this juicer the first and second times I used it. I got about 30-40 ml juice per large carrot I juiced. I am not sure if another juicer can make more juice and reduce wastage. Anyway the juicer's motor died during the third session. After 1 carrot, the juicer stopped. The motor wouldnt budge when I turned it back on. The motor of the juicer seemed to have died. The product looks fancy. Luckily I bought it from Sears where I plan to return it soon. If you were to buy this juicer, buy it from a store you could return and get your money back."
5,almost-instant juicer!,"Terrific product. Juices whole apples, bunches of kalewith ease and extremely quickly. I'm very satisfied.Clean up very easy compared to other juicers(Champion etc)though it is a little difficult to remove fine pulpfrom metal filter"
1,"received a broken, dirty juicer","I checked out all of the reviews and found only one entry poorly rated for this exact reason.Just my luck!The package came in nice shape, the inside carton was fine, I opened it and it looked great, with a bag of apples, pears, 5lbs of carrots, ginger and other assorted fruits and veggies sitting in the fridge awaiting certain juicing I opened the plastic bag and found the base broken (a big chunk missing) and dirty! Amazon is shipping a new unit, I asked for some one to physically check it.It looks nice, big throat for large items, plastic but ok looking, I did not get much past that, so waiting for the return label and its off to the post office for Paul. Stay tuned for my next review for my INSPECTED Breville juicer from Amazon."
1,Breville JE95XL Dead On Arrival,"I ordered the Breville Breville JE95XL with high hopes, but when I plugged it in it was dead. I read the owner's manual thinking there was something I missed. There wasn't, and it didn't work. The only bright star was Amazon. They were so nice when I called to explain the problem. I returned it for my money back. Thanks Amazon!"
3,Adequate but some flaws,"I like the juicer but there are a few things which could be improved. The pitcher is not well designed: a) You can't pour when the lid is on b) It is not sealed so it will pick up oders from the fridge c) There is a lip on the base so when you invert it and wash it in a dishwasher it collects dishwater.There is a similar issue with the pulp container. It collects a lot of water when inverted.My criticism is not of the juicer itself but of the additional parts which could be much better designed, especially the pitcher."
2,Not Very.,"Maybe I don't understand the definition of ""lurid."" From my perspective, I think this film would have been more aptly entitled, ""Warm and Cozy Castle Tales."" If you want hot busty babes, hot sex, hot raunch, and lots of nudity, this film is probably not for you."
2,Very Cheap,I was very disappointed with the quaility of the tie rack. It was definitely not worth the money.
3,So-so,"The hairdryer is OK, however, it is not worth over $100. I was excited because I thought that it was the same thing that my hairstylist uses, I was disappointed when I used the dryer. It does not get as hot, nor does it dry as fast as I had previously used. Save your money!"
1,Works great until it breaks,I really liked this dryer. Both lightweight and nice and hot. However they warranty is only 12 months and sure enough at 13 months the heating element no longer functions. Get a dryer with a better warranty.
3,Worked well for the year that it worked....,"I was given this as a xmas gift last year (Dec. 2008). For the last year, I've been satisfied with it. However, it burned out this morning and has ceased working. I would expect something of this price to last longer than one year! There was a strong, acrid burning smell, the core turned bright orange and sparks flew out of the back of the unit. I've had similiar things happen to other hair dryers (I have long hair and dry it daily) but they cost alot less money and lasted almost the exact same length of time. If you don't dry your hair as often or as long as I do, maybe it'll last longer for you...?"
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,"I am a professional stylist and purchased this dryer about a year ago. Within the first six months, it was making a terrible metallic sound and stopped heating properly. I sent it into to be fixed, and after a few months it is now only blowing cold air. This is ridiculous for such a high priced item- several stylists within the salon have cheaper brands that have lasted them for years. On top of that, two other CHI dryers in the salon have broken, including one that sparked and caught flame. I have tried emailing the company several times and have gotten no response, as have the other stylists. I was very unimpressed at their product and their terrible customer service. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
1,Gave as a gift to mom - she loves it!!! EDIT: Hates it!!!,EDIT: This thing stopped working about 4 months after she received it. Complete garbage. Don't waste your money. I've never had a hair dryer stop working before. It started only blowing cool air.Original review:I purchased this CHI Farouk Hair Dryer for my mother about a month ago. She absolutely loves this product. I saw it in action the first day and she was able to dry her hair in about 10-15 seconds. She normall spends a good 3-5 minutes just doing some minimal styling. Her hair was also noticeably shinier.I checked up with her again recently and she is still beaming about the hair dryer. It's pricey - but I guess you get what you pay for! She loves it.
2,Very good until it sparked in my hand,I heard so much about Chi and I decided to pay the extra dollars for it. I t worked fine for the first year and then one day sort of exploded while I was holding it. So as you can imagine- I don't use it anymore and will not buy Chi I guess since I've read similar stories even about their 1 inch flat iron. Too bad- you'd think Chi would deal with their problems given the frequency of very similar experiences.Thank you for people writing about these problems though.
3,It's okay,"This blowdryer is good overall. However, for the price, I was expecting it would provide more heat and dry my hair at a faster speed. Also, the on/off button is positioned in such a way that when you are holding the dryer as you blow your hair you accidentally turn it off continuously throughout the entire drying time. That's never been an issue for me with other dryers. I'm not sure why this is. Perhaps it should be positioned a little higher or lower on the handle. Thumbs up to the seller for making the transaction quick and easy."
2,Was great until it broke,"I really liked this dryer because it got hot and dried my long, thick hair fast. But now, after only 1 year, it only blows cold air. This is not what I was expecting from such an expensive dryer."
1,BROKE after less than 2 years,"my CHI turbo stopped blowing hot air after 18 months of mild use. worked great up until then, but for the money, i'd expect it to last longer. what's worse is their customer service tells you ""sorry - nothing we can do""."
1,Counterfeit!,"DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS SELLER!I had problems with this dryer 2 months after I purchased it. The Seller, ""DISCOUNTSJUNGLE"", told me that I had passed the 30 day warranty and should try the manufacturer.Farouk, the company that makes CHI products, told me that they have NO authorized web retailers and that my dryer is most likely a counterfeit.DO NOT buy Farouk products from any web retailers - affiliated with Amazon or not. I'm afraid that I am out $110."
1,Broke after 6 months,"I will never buy this brand again. It used to be good quality, but not anymore. After 1 week, the concentrator attachment melted. Then less than 6 months later it just completely stopped working. I dont even want to turn it in for a replacement under warranty - Im ready to move on to better quality hair dryers."
1,Bad Quality,"Had my Chi hair dryer for a little over a year, then it started sparking while I was using it and afterwards would only blow cold air. I spent a lot of money on it and it didn't last near as long as other dryers I've purchased for $20. Don't waste your money on it."
5,GREAT hair dryer!,"At only 1300 watts, it dries quickly and evenly. I love that CHI's can usually be returned to a salon or the manufacturer, regardless of how long it's been owed, IF it ever were to die. This dryer is fantastic, and I've had mine for a couple of years and counting!"
1,Good Dry Until it Quits Working,"I purchased the Chi Pro Low EMF dryer and it worked well until I had it several months. After 12 months, I noticed that it took 5-7 seconds to heat. Then after I had it for 14 months, it stopped heating completely. I contacted the Chi/Farouk company and was told that they only warrant their dryers for 12 months. It is too expensive a hair dryer to last just a little over a year. I have had several much less expensive dryers that have lasted much longer. I do not recommend this product."
1,Don't be fooled by the name and high price -- CHEAP CRAP!!,"I bought this for my wife for Valentines Day. I like to buy quality items and I wasn't scared by the price. She loved the gift but within a couple of months that turned to frustration. The switch for the cool-shot is nothing more than a cheap Chinese-made momentary on/off switch that is activated by the plastic button on the handle. This switch became stuck and therefore would only blow cold air, requiring me to open the case and switch it back. Eventually I removed the button to prevent the switch from being activated. In 11 months after purchasing the hair dryer the heating elements no longer heated so to the trash it went. Do make a mistake of buying hair dryers from CHI. On a positive note, the CHI straightening iron I bought along with the hair dryer is still working great."
4,Great hairdryer,I bought this hairdryer on the advise of my hairdresser. I really do see a difference between this one and the less expensive models out there. It dry's hair quicker and is lightweight to hold. I have thick wavy hair that I like to dry straight with a round brush. This does the trick.
2,Chi Hair Dryer,"I bought this hair dryer for a Christmes present. It stopped working last week. It started making noise, then smoking, then it quit. It has a 1 year warranty. I need to know how to return it for a replacement.Thanks, Kelly Keels"
2,Don't waste your money,"Nice in that it is very quiet and doesn't burn my hair. However, I've had two in the past 3 years and they both did the same thing - stopped blowing hot air. I will never waste this much money again on a dryer."
1,"Great Start, Poor Finish",Bought this dryer 13 months ago. Loved it for the 13 months it worked but it quit heating up completely this morning. The price is too high for its short life span. Other reviewers have had similar experiences.
1,great until it breaks,Purchased this 1 and a half years ago. It broke so I called the company. They told me to throw it out a buy a new one. Of course!! The guarantee it one year and after that they have no place to send it and no parts available. DONT SUPPORT COMPANIES LIKE THIS.
1,TERRIBLE Do Not Buy,"This is the second of these hairdryers I have bought. My previous dryer (purchased new on ebay) was fabulous!! It lasted for almost 10 years until it finally died. And I have very curly hair that I blow dry all the time.Something must have changed in how the dryers are made or this supplier just sells faulty dryers. This dryer is TERRIBLE. I have had it for a little over a year and a half and it is already dying. It takes forever to get hot and the flow of air on the highest setting is significantly reduced from what it was when I first bought the dryer. In addition, during use it will stop getting hot for a minute and then go back. And all this is with limited use as I now get my hair straightened and don't need the dryer to straighten my curly hair. For this price I expect things to last a lot longer!!Because of my previous experience I disregarded the other reviews. Big mistake. Wish I would have listened and saved my money for a better dryer. Do not buy this terrible dryer!"
1,NO MORE Chi products for me!,"I am done with Chi products. I bought some Chi products about six years ago- a hair dryer and a flat iron. They both lasted a long time - but recently I've had to replace them. My hair dresser told me to avoid Chi b/c they've since changed and their products are junk. She is so right. I bought this Chi dryer in July of 2011. It died within a month and Farouk did fix it- but I had to pay to ship it and pay $15, and I received a new hair dryer. Its been fine until today- it died again. So it lasted about a year. I only use it once a day, so a professional would use it many times per day- likely for her it would die in a month or so! Its past the warranty though so I'm done. I will buy a product my hair dresser recommended instead. Bummer.. that's A LOT of money to be out so fast. I would have been better off buying a cheapie dryer from Target and hoping it lasts a year!"
2,defective,I do not recommend this particular model. I love the brands but this model must be defective. The first one I received never worked. I received a replacement and it worked for about 4 months and now blows only cold air. Try a different one!
1,I bought a lemon,"I was very excited about this product because of all the positive reviews I read. However, I used the hairdryer once and 2 days later when I went to use it again - it was dead. I went online and tried troubleshooting it a few different ways, clicking the grounding button in and out - still nothing. When I printed out the return label to send it back I got a message - this product is not available for ""replacement"", so I just had to ask for a refund. It's a real bummer since I already discarded my old hunk of junk hair dryer. Now I'm afraid to order the same product again - so I'll replace it with a different hair dryer:("
2,"Not thrilled...I mean, Come on! It's CHI!!","I've had this hair dryer for a little less than two years & the heating element went out on it. You'd think for the price and the name it would last longer than my cheapy hair dryer I use in the other bathroom. Amazing, isn't it? The blow dryer started spitting sparks, so I turned it off and checked it over. When I turned it back on, it only blew cold air. Very frustrating. Guess you DON'T get what you pay for in this instance...."
4,PRO HAIR TOOL,I HAD A GOOD FRIEND RECOMMEND THIS HAIR DRYER-I LOVE IT-IT WILL BETHE FIRST ONE IN THE CONTINUING LINE OF THIS MAKE OF HAIR DRYERS.....FOR THE SERIOUS WHO WANT A QUALITY TOOL.
2,Buyer Beware - Heating Element Breaks Easily,"Agree with the other reviews posted. Heating element broke approximately 1 year and 4 months after purchase. Not worth it for the high price. Previously purchased a CHI hair dryer that lasted 5 years! Wish I had read these reviews prior to purchase. Recently had a CHI straightener also die after less than one year of use. Used to love CHI products, but am now considering switching to another brand entirely. Too bad."
3,not too strong,"I was looking for the best, and unfortinitlly the vegas hotels little dryer is much stronger :("
5,just great sellection,"yes here you can listen just great songs ,pure 80's high qallityand what can i say greattime am spending with this songs"
1,INACCURATE COMPLETELY!!!,"I live in Salem and have my entire life and there was no research done on this book. The information is not all accurate. The information she got could have easily been obtained at our visitors center!! As far as it being used in schools...please. I don't think so. I beleive the other two reviews were written by the author. If you want authentic 'witch stories' the bookstores offer many 'real' books, were people have actually spent the time to research their books! Please don't waste your time or your money."
3,Good food for thought.,"I agree with the assessment of Fr. Chad Hatfield from the back of the book: ""You may not agree with all that you find in these pages, but you will respect the voice of the father, who in love is offering you a challenge to grow.""There are topics where I think the arguments presented only take into account part of the opposing viewpoint and that he's a little too quick to back some sides of the debate and doesn't give ear to the other side, but overall, it's an enjoyable and challenging read.I'm of the opinion that Fr. Hopko is truly speaking out of love, and that he challenges our viewpoints on things and increases the opportunity for dialogue with ourselves as well as others. I found much of the book to be quite inspiring and very well written."
1,An example of merciless editing,"Don't buy this album. Every track is edited to its shortest version possible. The album is useless for all those DJ's probably wanting to include some italo disco classics on their sets. Even for the ordinary listener and for those who want to get a snapshot of 80's eurobeat this album could be really disappointing because of the absolute merciless editing. Some of the songs here were entirely created for the club and DJ scene, so never had a real radio version. Probably, the editing here is even worse than radio editing.Instead of this I recommend the ""World Of Italo Dance"" compilation by ZYX Records and, even better, the huge ""I love disco"" series by the Spanish label Blanco Y Negro, which features complete and 12"" extended versions.Here you have some examples of cruel editing:P. Lion / Happy Children / 3:40Koto / Jabdah / 3:36Sandy Marton / People From Ibiza / 3:48Laserdance / Humanoid Invasion / 3:20See what I mean? Don't buy this album"
4,Warm & Cozy,"This was an impulse buy after I caught a review on NPR. Some impulse buys pan out, some don't. Luckily, this one did. I teach English at a continuation high school. When the students write, I sometimes want some music that keeps us all going and yet doesn't call unwarranted attention to itself. This record is perfect, a sort of Latin Hip-Hop with club influences (no slamming beats). Since most of my students are Hispanic and Black, this is a great compromise, and it's off-beat enough to keep them interested, yet guessing."
2,Broad coverage but not focuss.,"I buy this book about 3 years ago (2000).My aim was to get a better understanding on statistical dsp.I got the lecture on advanced dsp on my master degree. I must confess that for me this is not an easy subject to master. Therefore a clear and well explained book on this subject is a very important for me.But I was dissapointed when I got this book!Yes, it is broad of coverage, but the content is not focuss.The connection between previous and next parts of discussion and chapters mostly does not show a clear link.Yes, it is full of facts, but I need more than bulk of facts: THE WAY OF THINKING, why we do and why we don't do.It didn't help me to master the subject.For the reader who want an easy to read and clear in explaination as well as good reasoning and examples, I would suggest to go for another book such as Steven M Kay (Volume 1, Estimation Theory). For me this is a lot better investment of time and money!.Thank you for reading my review."
2,Bad Writing and Worse Directing.......,"This is a sad, sad collection of mostly movies that never should have been made. The movies are full of politically correct platitudes, silliness, and cornball antics. The characters are all over done to the point of being totally unbelievable. There are some excellent actors in the movies, but the movies themselves are so bad there is little those actors could do to salvage the movie.This collection is little more than series of tedious and repetitious pontifications of Mr. Kramer's extremely liberal political views to the point that the movies become predictable, boring, at times offensive, at times silly, and generally unentertaining.Save your money. This is collection no deal at any price."
4,Great Value for Interesting Collection,"Stanley Kramer had an interesting career, and this collection reflects that. Most interesting for me was ""The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T,"" the only live action movie of a Dr. Seuss story that he allowed in his lifetime. Even though he wrote the story and all the song lyrics, he disowned the film after it was poorly received by critics and audiences. He didn't even mention it in his autobiography - but it's interesting to see nevertheless - the film looks well produced and the colors and sets seem very Dr. Seuss like."
2,"No movie on ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" disc!","I now own two copies of the bonus DVD and NO copy of the film! :-( Unfortunately, I did not discover this until I was ready to view it. I originally bought this collection for the copy of ""Ship of Fools"" and ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"". But, did not take opportunity to watch GWCD until today. The DVD had the right label, but alas, no movie! How disappointing! I would have given it higher score, but not now. I guess I will have to buy another copy. Boo! :-("
3,Pithy and a little hard to follow,"Sometimes the story wanders and it is not clear which of the characters is thinking/writing the book. The descriptions of the drama and scenery is very good. I'm not done yet, but hope it turns out ok."
1,So little talent....,"Now that I've read other reviews here I might reconsider and try to finish it, but 1/3 through I am put off by the strained descriptions and the completely unrealistic dialogue that Carlson has squeezed out onto paper.I never met any regular guys who talked like this: ""What's the weather, Ronnie?"" (Ronnie is a 20-year old ex-shoplifter) ""That wind has quit at least,"" he said. ""I think we're in for a gorgeous spring day here in the world,"" he said. ""Chilly tonight but we can get something done today.""Sorry, it just doesn't do it for me. Maybe I have been reading too much good writing lately to be favorably impressed by this book."
4,It's about character,"Five Skies is a simple, understated story in the hands of a masterful writer. Carlson's characters reveal their complexity over the course of the novel. The writing is crisp and economical, but the sense of time and place is wonderfuly tangible.I don't like to compare writers or stories, but it's hard to escape comparisons to Cormac McCarthy (though without the bleak edge), John Steinbeck, or the wonderful Treasure of the Sierra Madre. If you enjoyed these, you will like Five Skies."
2,"Read the stories, not this","This novel is a disappointment to many Ron Carlson fans. I've read his two most recent novels--not the newest due out this next week--and all the short stories. This novel feels under-imagined and over-scripted--as if someone who knew perfectly well how to write twenty pages were trying desperately to stretch it to two hundred. It's not a terrible novel, but he's a better writer than this. Though I usually prefer a novel over short stories, I love Carlson's stories more than almost any novel I can think of. They are funny, aching, and explosive with insight about the human heart. Read The New Yorker review excerpt above and then go read Carlson's brilliant short stories. A Kind of Flying is a good place to start, but also be sure to read At the Jim Bridger, which I've handed out like candy to my friends."
2,Digiview Productions no better then any other version,"I checked this out from the local library as I have always wanted to watch this as Guy Madison was my ""WILD BILL HICKOK"". Good enough story although his roll was too short. Typical Public Domain movie with weak color, dull sound and unrestored. If you can't find it for less than $4 forget it."
4,Tough puzzle!,This is a good quality puzzle and its pretty challenging. The reflection in the water is very similar in color to the sky and there are a lot of pieces to go through. Would recommend to someone looking for a challenge but not for someone who gets frustrated easily.
5,Wonderfull Karen,"Listening to this marvelous CD brought back many good memories for me.I can't say enough about what an incredible talent Karen Carpenter had. One of a kind voice. It's too bad that she only produced one solo album. After listening once through I was hooked; I wanted to hear more, a lot more! I did not realize that Karen had produced a solo work until after I had read ""Little Girl Blue"" by Randy Schmidt, so even though this is not for a book review I would recommend that volume as well."
5,Outstanding work!,"With her solo album Karen Carpenter put together a gem. Every song on the album is top notch and she sings with a renewed excitement. Phil Ramone, Bob James, Rod Temperton and the other producers and arrangers did an excellent job in creating arrangements which suited Karen's voice and personality perfectly. This album has soul and a bit of funk to it. I just love it!My favorite tracks are:Guess I Just Lost My HeadIf I Had youRemember When Lovin' Took all NightIf We TryLovelinesMake Believe It's Your First TimeThe only song I don't care for is ""My Body Keeps Changing My Mind"".I just wish Karen would have lived long enough to record another solo album as her first solo was outstanding!"
5,"A Then New Sound From A Then Superstar, Karen Carpenter","Being an avid fan of The Carpenters, this is a definite collector cd. The history of this album makes one wonder, what were they thinking? I have seen interviews of Richard and Phil Ramone, and yet I still do not understand their frame of mind in thinking this was a mistake. The songs here are some you may have never heard before, but Karen makes them hers as only she can. My personal favorite is ""My Body Keeps Changing My Mind"". Yes, it does emit a certain disco quality, but it was 1980. I give the album five stars for sound and lyrical quality. Karen, like so many other stars like her, will live forever through their music."
2,Should Have Never Been Released,"This is no where near the caliber of Karen's previous releases. Richard, Herb Alpert and A&M were right. I bought this CD because of my memory of Karen's beautifully clear vocals. I was extremely disappointed with this effort. Totally uninspired recording."
3,"Worth buying, but not a standout","First let me say that I love Karen, so I am admittedly biased. But then anyone reading this review probably does too, so it's okay. Bottom line: she really did need Richard. He knew her voice, and how to arrange the music to bring out its intrinsic drama and pathos. Phil Ramone apparently did not know what to do with her voice, so he basically did everything with it. The thing about the Carpenters recordings is that they have a very timeless quality about them; these recordings sound quite dated. Maybe some of these songs would have been hits in 1980, but I doubt any would have hit #1. The thing that clinched it for me was ""Make Believe It's Your First Time"". The ""Voice Of The Heart"" version is much better--you gotta give Richard credit for knowing his stuff. For you Carpenters completists, this album is a must-have, of course. But if you're looking for that undiscovered gem of a song, you may be disappointed."
3,It's OK,This is singing done by a woman with a better-than-average voice. She had a pleasant voice but not an outstanding voice. I could never understand how people would talk about what a great voice she had. I wouldn't consider her voice to be outstanding. I think what really holds the album back is the selection of songs.
5,THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL,"I'm a 32 year old hispanic male with alot of different musical tastes, from disco, punk rock, r & b, oldies, salsa, merengue, big bands of the 40's, MOTOWN, pop, ect....but everytime i hear Karen Carpenter sing, everything stops for me. I have to stop and listen. This woman had a voice that soothes my soul, it's as simple as that. It's soft, it's crystal clear, it's sweet, it's homie, it's warm and above it all, it's REAL...I love this woman. It is a real shame that we are living on a generation where any no-talent idiot like 50 CENT, Britney, J-Lo and countless others make millions selling records with NO REAL talent! Music today SUCKS, thank god we can go back to our old records and listen and have great memories. It is a crying shamethat Karen Carpenter is gone, she would have been making some great music today. Anything she and her brother made, gets a 5 and plus stars rate from me. Always."
5,Sophisticated Karen,"A fresh, sexy Karen is heard on this great album. Her vocal talents really shine on these diverse selections. ""If We Try"" is one of the standout songs here - modern and jazzy. Karen sounds self-assured and beautiful as ever. She sounds like she is having fun throughout this album.The most incredible performance here is ""Make Believe It's Your First Time"". Karen conveys intimacy tinged with sadness in this outstanding track. She'll just break your heart with this one. If the ""Carpenters"" version of this song is the only one you've heard, you are in for a rare treat with this superior solo performance. The arrangement is far better than the one she recorded with her brother. This solo version is one of Karen's best of all time."
3,This Album should have been out in 1980,"Its a shame will never know how great this CD would have been if it was released in 1980. I'm sure""Making Love in the Afternoon""would have been a hit. And""My body keeps changing my mind."" But,""If I had you"" is better on the Lovelines CD. Richard remixed it beautifull,keeping the great ending in the record. And there is too many songs about making love. I wish Barry Gibb would have produced a couple of the tracks. And Richards song writing partner,John Bettis, who co-wrote Madonna's,""Crazy for You""Would have been fantastic for Karen to sing.She would have Blown Madonna away. But at least we have this solo album to cherish of Karen,who's life ended so soon."
5,Having Trouble Deciding?,"Having trouble deciding? You're thinking too hard! Just get it! You know you love Karen's work and this is one of a kind material. You won't be disappointed. There's only one problem - the more you listen, the more addicted you become and you won't want a cure."
4,A much need change of pace,"Shows a glimpse of what might have happened if Karen had gone solo - it's not a classic album, but she has a far wider background to work with musically than she did on any of the Carpenters albums. On the later ones, especially, she was getting trapped in a world of cute arrangements and syrupy strings. I agree with the first reviewer - the version of ""Make Believe It's Your First Time"" on this CD is far simpler and far better than the overproduced one on ""Voice of The Heart"". This version shows what a fine song this is. I also *love* ""My Body Keeps Changing My Mind"", which I think could still be a hit dance single today, and which shows Karen could sing anything well. Other favorite cuts include ""Lovelines"" and the demo ""Last One Singing the Blues"". We miss you, Karen."
4,Karens Solo Album...,"I think she would have been disappointed that it wasnt released when completed. Its worth being in any ""fans"" collection, and whilst there may not have been 1 specific hit on it, it has always been good to listen to...NOT I might add as ""Time"" by Richard Carpenter, but buy this, you wont be disappointed"
3,"Not too good, not too bad","Hmm, I do believe it is sort of medicore since none of the songs just stick in my head. However, it shouldn't have been automatically shelved (I'm not saying this in an overdramatic way) The album could have been better, but is not unbearable.Personally, I would have prefered a more um. . . rocker edge to it (haha)Rest in peace, love."
4,Fats Domino critique,"The CD is just great and brings back wonderful memories, my only criticism is that for some reason I can not play it in my Car CD player, it plays great on the one in the house and everywhere but there, leading me to believe there is something in the way it was made. Outside of this it is great and I received it earlier than expected."
2,complete crap.,The flag I received was poorly constructed. The stripes weren't the same size and the stitching was crooked and huge. Unfortunately I bought this item by default because there weren't any other pride flags in this size that I could find on the Internet. Good luck.
2,Heavy Sandals,"The sandals were lovely but very heavy for a thong flipflop. Because they were so heavy, they rubbed at the top of my foot. Yikes and Owie!"
2,RAINBOW SANDALS,If someone wants to order these Rainbow Sandals the sizing is all wrong - I have to send mine back now and looks like the sizing is off by two shoe sizes.Kim Garrett
1,False guarantee,"I bought a pair of rainbows, at 50 bucks, for the same reason that I'm sure anyone does; the ""lifetime"" guarantee. After two months of daily wear the bottom sole wore thru to the middle sole so I contacted Rainbow and this is the reply I received:""I'm sorry, but wear and tear on the sandals is not covered by the guarantee. The life of the sole or top sole depends on the wearer of the sandal. Some peoples sandals last longer than others.Personally, I can wear into the middle layer from the bottom sole in one month. It does not mean that the sandals are defective, it just means that I drag my feet a little. Unfortunately, there is nothing that we can do for wear and tear.Have a nice day.STEVE LANECUSTOMER SERVICE-end email-DO NOT BUY RAINBOWS! for the guarantee. If you like leather flip-flops that cost twice as much as reefs and last a third of the time then these are the flops for you. Otherwise your money will be spent better elsewhere."
5,What I've come to expect from Rainbow,"Sandals look great! I really like the thin strap/black leather combo. It's a classic look and they're very comfortable. Quick shipping with amazon prime, and no issues with seller. Purchase these and you will be happy."
2,expensive return policy,i was not pleased with the product and when I decided to return them there was a restocking fee plus and $8.00 return fee which i think is unrealistic when ordering something from the internet which I hadn't seen in person.
4,watch the sizing,"These sandals take some major breaking in, but hopefully will be worth it. Also the sizes run pretty large. An extra large is supposed to be 8.5 to 9.5 but its probably as large as a ten"
5,rainbow narrow sandals,"The white rainbows are very clean looking and matches with anything casual! it does get dirty pretty quickly, but I just wipe it down after a day's worth of walking. Also, it's very very tight and painful the first two days and then the sandals start forming into the shape of your feet so it's extremely comfortable."
4,Be cautious! BREAK THEM IN,"I received Rainbows about 2 months ago and was really psyched about them. EVERYONE I asked said they were amazing, so I thought why not? Well, I got them and I went to a party directly afterwards (where there was a lot of running, which I did a lot of). After I came home fromt the party my feet hurt so bad because blisters had formed on the inside of my Big toe and the one next to it. My feet hurt for many days after that. I was afraid to wear them again after that because I didn't want to deal with the pain, but a friend had told me that you had to soak them first. So, I soaked them in a pool and walked around in them to mold my feet and now I am feeling much more confident about them not hurting my feet anymore because of the really tight straps. So BE SURE TO BREAK THEM IN BEFORE WEARING THEM FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME!!!!!"
1,Fire Engine RED????,"Where I live we call this ORANGE ! Granted it has a slight red tone but it certainly is NOT FIRE ENGINE RED ! I was counting big time on this for an important project and THIS orange STUFF will not do at all. If you want real red - do NOT buy this product ! I don't know what you should buy but this is not it. I am certain that this is not an Amazon based problem, but rather lies with the description provided to them. NOT, I repeat, NOT fire-engine red! . . . it's orange. looks red in the ad - NOT."
2,Removable,Didnt do what I intended which was cover a cardboard box. So this stuff is probably ok but havea limited range of use. I didnt stick t a cardboard box.
1,What a waste!,Was this stuff even real contact paper or a Chinese knock-off? It was tissue thin and easily seen through. Threw it out in the end! What a waste!
5,"Madelon Sprengnether, THE ANGEL OF DULUTH","This original and compelling set of prose poems, published in Buffalo, New York, by White Pine Press in 2006, meditates on loss, sexuality, water, and menopause in vivid and sensuous language of bruised coloring."
5,"Outstanding, if dispiriting","A must read for anyone who wants to really understand Haiti, and especially itssad long history of poverty secondary to exploitation and racism. It's a paradigm for the United States' policies and behaviors of last century throughout Central and South America. (Book can still be purchased directly from publisher, Common Courage, at reasonable cost)."
2,Disappointing,"A disappointing biased review of the history and politics of Haiti. The conspiring bogeymen consist of the USA, France, Canada, the UN, the World bank, the IMF, JFK, the OAS, Bill Clinton, George Bush, most journalists and especially that right wing mouthpiece - the NY Times. This narrative can be likened to the blind mans description of the elephant. A disjointed and bizarre introduction by Noam Chomsky is included."
2,Clunky,"These are very, very heavy. I can really feel the difference when they are in my gym bag. It's not so noticable on my feet, but they still seem pretty clunky. The insole area has little bumps to prevent slipping, but to me they feel like nails. All in all, not nice to wear. It's kind of a shame, because they seem to be decent quality, and it looks to me like they could have made the bottoms thinner to lighten them up. For me, reducing the size of the traction bumps on the inside would be an improvement. I considered trying to trim them down with a knife, but there are just too many."
5,They work great,"I was skeptical of the claim that these sandals would control foot odor, but they really work. I have had several sandals in the past and after a few months of wearing them i would notice that they would start to smell. I have had these for 3 months now and i wear them every day. I am pleased to say that my sandals don't smell. I love them. I would recommend these to anyone who has this problem."
3,"Great product, short ""lifespan""","It's a great product. I enjoy the ""heavy duty"" feel of it. Helps prevent the nasty build up that can happen with sandals. But it appears to have a less than 2 year life span. I use these sandals as my indoor house sandals exclusively. I don't go outdoors with them. Just inside the house. After about a year and a half, the straps started to break. This is my second pair and according to my purchase records, they've both been less then 2 years. My regular, outdoor sandals have lasted me longer. I would give it a 5 star, but with the short life span of the sandals, I sadly gave it only 3."
4,Very Useful!,This book is great! I've been looking for it for a couple of years now. It's very useful to me.
4,A Topic Not Often Addressed,"British pastor Edwards examines the controversial issues of the book's title, and gives a careful response which is faithful to biblical teaching."
4,Madredeus...,Great album for a group that is difficult to categorize...a modern version with Fado roots
2,a reasonable read,i bought this book for my 6 year old. the story lacks depth and doesn't hold your interest. maybe it's a cultural difference as we are in australia and it is probably more relevant to american children's lives. still a reasonable story though.
4,Great for any golfer,"Great stroke counter that counts putts separately...The average golfer shoots over 100, and with talking and looking for my ball between shots,I'd conveniently forget my stroke count, especially when you get to between 7-10??? Not anymore..I just add the strokes when I get back to the golf cart....then go on to the next hole. Only drawback it that it only keeps score for only one golfer, so everyone needs to buy their own.Getting better....Chuck"
5,Great memories,This is one of the best educational series ever. I was watching it back in france when I was a kid so it is rather old but still well done. I just wish it would be dubbed or even subtitled in english so that my wife and kids could enjoy it and learn about the human body without even noticing it.Great product for whoever understands french and wants to know better or teach the kids about the human body
2,Just Ok...,"I'm a big Tony Bennett fan, but I can't say that I enjoyed this cd as much as I thought I would. It was relatively inexpensive, so at least I didn't waste a lot of money on something I won't listen to often. The quality isn't the best and the music is just so-so. Many of the songs are without his voice, just a big band sound. If you're looking for Tony Bennett music, look elsewhere. He is better than this."
3,Does not fit leadpipe,"This did not fit the leadpipe of my F.E. Olds Horn. I will fit on other tubes and I will use it, but I was slightly disappointed."
3,Susan Laughs,"The book it's self was great. But the binding was torn really bad, and I can't leave in my classroom library because of it's condition."
5,Speedy Service,Amazon is so great. I can get the item within a week.(Standard International Shipping From USA to Hong Kong)
4,A freshman must,"All freshman enter the world of college dazed and confused, and usually quite hungry. After years of mom preparing hearty meals, freshman are helpless, lost in the real world.... now they are no longer lost. Josh Lambert's book is a must for all freshman entering college. How else can an 18 year old learn how to cook and win over the hearts of many young women. In fact this book is fundamental to the growth and learning experience of all incoming freshman. Buy this book for all freshman you know, even sophomores... teach them to cook!!"
2,reluctant cook,This is cute and well-written but it is only for a college cook who has access to a full kitchen and is motivated to buy unusual products. It does not work for a starving dorm guy. It is better suited for an urban apartment dweller with a nice market nearby.
3,Not for those with a general idea on how to cook,"I purchased this book from Amazon and received it today, and I am sending it back tomorrow. It is geared towards people who have NO IDEA how to cook, yet the recipes are for food that most college aged students wouldn't eat.I was looking for a cook book that had general recipes as opposed to specific items (Italian, Spanish, etc) and was hoping a College Student Cookbook would be the best bet. Don't get me wrong this book does cover a wide area of foods but how many college students eat Bean Sprout Julienne?The book does not have as many recipes as you would expect from a 98 page book. I would really only recommend this to someone who has no idea what they are doing in the kitchen."
3,Macgyver's Guide to Cooking,"This is the perfect cookbook for someone who has never cracked an egg before. It gives you tips on what to do if you are lacking in supplies, the recipes are open ended so it is difficult to do a poor job with a recipe, and it includes commentary so it feels less like an instruction manual and more like a guide. It was a great gift for a friend of mine who assumed it was impossible to cook in college. This is not a good cookbook for people with a firm grasp on cooking. The wording will irritate anyone with experience."
4,"Intriging, intense, interesting view of tote betting.","I have read (and studied) countless betting systems. The Tote Board is Alive and Well is one the truer accounts of betting systems I have had the pleasure to come across. With an ounce of concentration, anyone can become a successful bettor and literly any track in America."
3,"Filthy from seller, but a fantastic bag.","I have no idea how this could have happened. The bag came in a plastic bag, but was covered in a milky, semi-oily, moldy sort of residue - as though it had been stored in a damp basement. To boot, the carrying/shoulder strap came broken. Because I needed the bag immediately, returning it was out of the question - or at least without cleaning and using it first.A solid 20 minutes later with a heavy does of Soft Scrub and an overnight dry and it was fine. But I was stilled rather grossed out and have no idea what was on the bag.The bag itself is great. I'd give it 5 stars. Heavy duty, well constructed - lots of storage and well padded where it needs to be. I had a Technics bag and this is far superior. So maybe it was just the seller."
2,"Nice Looking, BUT.......","I read a few GOOD reviews about this unit, so decided to buy one. Quality seems o.k. Set up was o.k. but using it is very confusing for me. Seems as though you're always configuring this or that when trying to perform a function. I think XEROX or whoever makes this for them, should've done their homework and made operation easier. I should've sent it back as an unsatisfied customer......"
2,nothing new,"Most of Mr. Hertsgaard's points are accurate, though hardly novel. His work is mostly a rehash of college history 101. Indian Removal/genocide was certainly part of the dark side of American history...as if American is the only country with historical baggage. Most foreigners, however, have only a vague appreciation of it. And, like all self-respecting critics of American society, Hertsgaard joins the MacMovement. Enough is enough: if you don't like McDonald's, well, don't GO there! On the whole, he could easily condense this 200-plus-page effort by focusing more on really important issues like American hypocrisy on trade/aggy issues and, something he glosses over, American military presence in the Middle East."
4,An Insight from the Outside,"""The Eagle's Shadow: Why America Fascinates and Infuriates the World"" by Marks Hertsgaard covers a variety of topics that polishes and tarnishes the United States' image to the world. Hertsgaard uses many interviews with worldly people to prove his points about the U.S. Hertsgaard also uses the aid of factual events and statistics that are surprising when revealed. The more I got into ""The Eagle's Shadow,"" the more I thought of my own preceptions of the United States. This book is good if you wish to question how real is the ""American Dream."""
1,Contains Almost Nothing About What Foreigners Think,"This book devotes only a few pages to recounting meetings with just a few individuals overseas. Almost all of the book's 200+ pages are devoted to an unexceptional exposition of the author's opinions. The book sometimes implies, without providing any support, that these opinions are representative of what foreigners think of America, but usually not even that effort is made to connect the author's opinions with the alleged theme of the book.If you are an American who keeps up with the news, you have already heard what the author has to say. If you are a liberal you might even agree with it. If you are not, you will find this book especially tedious. Hertsgaard is preaching to the choir and seems to assume that you will believe whatever he says. Whatever your political view, you will not find any fresh insights in this book.I can recommend to all that they skip ""The Eagle's Shadow."""
4,Do not close your eyes and read it!,"Average American citizen do not have much contact with the outside of the United States. Even he or she watches 4 hours TV every night, it is very difficult to hear from outsiders about America (Except Middle East Hatred) Mr.Hertsgaard looks for likes/dislike of other people about America. His interviews are very enlightening and interesting. Sometimes it is very bothering but reality bites, that is what people think and they have their reason. Every American should read this book and criticize the book (some parts I do not agree) and themselves honestly. Every nation has some flaws, but the cure start with true findings. That makes America real superpower."
1,WORST BOOK I EVER FINISHED,"What a sucker job. All those years over seas and all those countries visited and he talked to about 6 people. From the title I thought he talked to hundreds. The rest of the book (99.6%) is him blabbering on about SUVs, high school kids being dumb, U.S. politics being corrupt, and the Wizard Of Oz. I did read ever word though. Kind of like watching a movie that is so bad its actually good. Oh yea...and I'm suppose to feel stupid because I did not know what the HARLEM RENNAISSANCE was in U.S. History. I'm too ashamed to pass this book on. I'll just recycle it."
2,Interesting for the wrong reason,"With a title suggesting strong emotions, hard questions put and harder answers given, I was intrigued by the idea of an American author attempting to describe and interpret non-American views of the U.S.A.; an awareness and understanding of non-American viewpoints evidently a major failing of Americans at present.Unfortunately, foreign perceptions of the U.S.A are only the ostensible subject of this volume; we see very little of the opinions of Hertsgaard's interlocutors and too much of Hertsgaard's own, rather commonplace, views.With this mundane work, Hertsgaard merely perpetuates a perception that Americans, 'liberal' or not, are solipsistic, trite, and sublimely indifferent to the views of the foreigners whose lives are so affected, unwillingly or not, by American global political, social and corporate adventurism.So, for this reader, no fascination and no fury, but as one feels with so many American products, just contemptuous amusement and weary disappointment."
4,from different perspective,"great book! im very sad how other people rate this book.the writer doesnt hate america. ( believe or not )he is only tryin to tell the truth!i think most of americans are very ignorant.they dont know anything about the world..this is true.since i travel a lot and moved this country, ive experienced many things which mostly explained in this book.this book is very popular in other countries becauseit tells you almost EVERYTHING how we think about this country.maybe the writer could add more detailed information.so far, i loved this book a lot."
4,Mark Hertsgaard: An Exceptional Journalist,"This book takes a much punditized subject and addresses it with the intelligence and depth so lacking in media pundits today. Mark Hertsgaard is a serious voice in the increasingly dumbed-down Fourth Estate. His research is impeccable, his reasoning is clear-headed, and he is also a captivating writer. Agree or disagree with Hertsgaard's insights, this book is well worth reading for people interested in the subject.And I'd also highly recommend his ""On Bended Knee"" -a truly great book about the nature of journalism-- written in the days of Ronald Reagan, that great teflon communicator."
5,Niagara Falls-Sounds Of Nature,This is just what it says it is a recording of Niagara Falls.It starts off with the falls in the background with birds and quickly the falls get louder and drown out the bird sounds.At there loudest it is a very loud roar.Occasionally the falls become more distant and you start to here birds again but it soon goes back to the roar.You hear the roar of the falls for most of the 60 minutes this last.This is so soothing and will make it easier to sleep or just relax your mind plus this is a necessity for people that will never get to Niagara Falls.I also recommend Niagara Falls the gorge and the glen from the solitudes series.Unlike this one you here a lot of wildlife and streams and you occasionally here the roar on this one were you here it constant on the sounds of nature Niagara Falls.Both of them are great though.
3,Only OK,"Would have been 5 stars if there was not shushing in the middle, really? Yes right in the middle in the recording you can hear people approaching and being shushed."
3,Won't rock the house.,"Attractive and pleasant sound reproduction. However,the sound quality breaks down at higher volume levels. On my computer distortion becomes significant when the volume control is turned a little past half way. Otherwise, a decent product for the price, provided you don't need to rock the house."
2,Orchestra from hell,"Wretched orchestration! Producer Creed Taylor did Wes no favors by introducing Montgomery to ""the orchestral setting that was to be his recording milieu until his death...""If you are looking classic for Wes albums, skip this one!"
2,"Bad book written just to hack and slay the XFL, which as Fox Joe Buck correctly stated was a ""one year experiment"", nothing more","It's easy to kick someone/thing thatis already down and out, but thismeathead pours it on with a trowl!Yea, the XFL was average. But asthe years go by, people will beglad they taped those XFL games,as more and more ex-players andCoaches get broadcasting, Coach-ing and playing jobs in the threefulltime Pro Leagues out there;The Ar.FL, the CFL and of coursethe NFL."
4,The XFL...we hardly knew ya,"Brett Forrest's book is a somewhat behind the scenes story of the disaster that was the XFL. He does a good job in the book of telling the story of what lead up to McMahon's idea of the XFL and the book does a fairly good job of the league and the problems that the league faced from its humble beginnings to its disastrous ending.I would have liked to had more behind the scenes comments from more players and coaches. Obviously, the XFL was an experiment that went downhill very quickly, but it would have been an even better book if the author could have had more football players talk about the XFL experience on the road, during practices and how they viewed the XFL.A good read and for football fans it is an interesting read on a league that came on the scene with high hopes and hobbled off the field quietly."
4,Good read,"An interesting book that doesn't skew TOO far into McMahon bashing. In fact, McMahon is actually presented in the most realistic fashion that I've read personally. That said, it is kind of obvious that the author didn't write the book until he knew what the outcome would be, and one can't help but wonder if most of the ""skew"" comes out of that fact.Whether you watched the XFL or only heard about it, this book gives us some really intriguing behind the scenes viewpoints of the mini-drama that was the league's only season. Anyone else remember the dead air in one of the early weeks? Charles Puleri? The SNL/J-Lo fiasco? Rusty vs. Jesse? ""He Hate Me?"" Clement vs. Grieb? All of the stories, big and small, of the XFL are covered, with additional info from an insider point of view. Good stuff."
5,Rubbermaid Action Packer,Purchased this to store water & toys for a group of us at a Dog Park. It's be such an excellent product. It is waterproof and very durable. Would highly recomment this for outdoor use.
2,Not as big as dimensions!,"Be careful! This is not actually the same size as they claim in the dimension listing. It is much shorter in height than they claim. I measured several times what I intended to store and when it arrived, it was not as described. Be forwarned."
2,"Ok, but could be alot better","For the purpose of use, works great. I was not impressed with the side handles, too shallow and no directions. The product says you can mount in back of trucks or whatever, again no directions. After calling company, they said just to use a cord/rope to hold down using the lid. This method works, but you can see how useful it would be to just cut the cord and take the whole thing. You would have thought rubbermaid could have come up w/a simple attachment, instead of bad marketing. Would not recommend."
1,Misleading Description,"The title of the item listed shows a dimension that is significantly larger than actual. If you read the fine print on the product description, it shows a size much smaller than that listed in the title. I have returned 1 of the 4 I ordered because they were not of sufficient size. I am still waiting on Amazon to send me three more return slips for the remaining totes. All in all, not a good experience!"
2,too much box. too little information,"When looking at this item online, I didn't realize how huge it is. Also, the company that sells it can't be bothered with customer service. They absolutely refuse to mail it overseas. It is just a huge headache. I'm returning it and never dealing with them again."
2,Solid but poor design,"The ActionPacker is a good solid container...I have owned an older one for more than ten years...great product and very satisfied...However, this one, with its flared sides is impractical and a highly inefficient design...The area of the base is significantly less than the top...Optimal storage requires straight sides...back to the drawing board on this one.."
3,Good but too pricy online!,"These Rubbermaid storage boxes are useful and durable products. However, they are so expensive online! My local Walmart sells the 8 gallon storage bin for $15. The 24 gallon storage bins are only $20. So check your Walmarts before shopping for these. I have not found the 35 gallon bins at stores though. You most likely have to purchase the larger ones online!"
4,Truck Box,"My son uses this to store tools in his truck, you can fasten it down and remove with ease."
2,24 gallon storage box is bowing,"Length:: 0:39 Minsbowing after 2 weeks in a warm room (garage like setting). check out the video I made showing the bowing out below the letters and bowing in above he letters. sorry I don't agree with the other reviewers, but my experience with the 24 gallon model wasn't a positive one. the 24 gallon storage box isn't as thick as the larger Rubbermaid boxes. the 24g box is an overpriced piece of plastic IMO. the larger Rubbermaid Action Packer storage boxes are sturdier."
5,Great tack trunk!,"This trunk has room for my daughter's huge grooming tote, all her grooming supplies, leather cleaning supplies, towels, and there is still plenty of room for more stuff (her saddle, blanket, etc. would not fit in here - if you want a trunk for those kinds of items you will need a bigger container). This container doesn't look very big when you open the lid but it turned out that this one fits the bill just fine. It's tough enough so that vermin won't be able to chew their way into it and the latch is stiff enough that you could carry it upside down without worrying about the lid opening. It would be an even better product if it had wheels but if wheels were a deal-breaker I would have purchased another product."
4,Very sturdy and secure. Tough to carry,"Excellent durability. Good space inside and latches closed. Would be better if it was taller and not as wide so one person could carry it. As built now, you will need two people to handle this huge bin. Would also help if the handholds were deeper. Overall, very good.Update 11/22/11: Not as durable as I had originally thought. Sat on one of these (I'm not very heavy) and the molded seem on the lid split, so now I'm getting water inside the hollow lid. And yes, the lack of a decent handle is a major annoyance. Still, it's a decent box that continues to function okay."
4,great for in the car,"i have had this in my car for holding all my stuff. like oil, windshield fluid, and winter gear. i love it. i've had it for over 8 years and it is in really good condition. my son has one just like and uses it alot."
4,Works for my Ranger,"Used this in place of a tool box in the back of my ranger. Bolted it in so no one could walk off with it. Fits perfect, holds the tools for my handyman work and looks good. Quickly shipped, easy to open box, no assembly. Saved a ton of money over a diamond plate toolbox that would be hard to take in and out."
4,Good but expensive,"A good case overall. A little over priced I would say. Also the pad lock loop is plastic, so it will lock out kids and stuff but it would be very easy to break into."
5,Awesome ActionPacker!,Whatever issue the previous reviewer's had it has now been resolved. This is a great product and came exactly as described!
3,cargo box,"Ipurchaed this packer cargo box in lieu of more expensive ATV boxes. I use it on my 650cc atv to carry a multitude of items, I did add some D rings to hold tie downs to hole items from bouncing around, this works very well and keeps items in their place, it has been used in various weather conditions and suffered no leaks, everything stays dry and in place now"
1,Not what I gathered from reviews,Upon receiving this box i didn't like it. It is thin walled plastic kind of like a child's toy box. I needed a heavy duty toolbox that is reasonably water resistant. This does not even come close. It has a plastic hinge and a plastic locking mechanism. its big and bulky and not impact resistant. I could see using this for pool storage or a toy box or to keep stuff from getting drenched outside a home but it certainly doesn't belong on a job site. The only good thing was the seller. They accepted the return and paid for the shipping! They are A+ and highly recommended!
4,Rubbermaid Action Cargo Box - 48 gallon,"I would have given this 5 stars if it was not so difficult for one person to life, as the handles are very far apart. I ended up adding some rope loops where the handles are located and now it is much easier to pick up. Other than that, the box itself is sturdy, roomy, and functional."
5,Why was this raised $29.99 to $44.99??? Too much now!,Just curious as to why Amazon raised this box from $29.99 to $44.99. I bought one of these from Amazon a few weeks back for $29.99 and when I came back to buy more I noticed that the price had been raised to $44.99. I ask WHY? Others on here are still selling it for $29.99 BUT you have to pay S/H and TAX which I HATE!!!!. Amazon - please lower the price back to the original $29.99 and I and others will buy more!!
2,Not rain proof,"The Rubbermaid Action Packer is not rain proof or water proof. The latches create an easy path for rain to come in and wet the contents.Except for that serious flaw the Action Packer is sturdy, and has convenient latches. I would not buy this for camping or other outdoor use."
3,"yikes, it leaks!","This was purchased to hold charcoal, the chimney, mitt, starter cubes and other tools outside by the grill. I needed a weather-proof container. Right off, we had a rain and sad to say, some water was inside the container. Too much trouble to return it so have turned it around to shelter that corner from blowing rain... I hope. The leak is due to a defect in the upper edge of the container.November, 2012: now that I have had this container outside (turned around) for over a year, it has turned out to be a wonderful resolution to my challenge of keeping grill supplies safe and dry! Water has not gotten in since did the I re-positioning."
4,An almost perfect container,"Works well. Locks well. Stays dry well. The only thing that could be improved would be to use a heavier-weight plastic; the bottom corners can dent a bit. Otherwise, it's a great container and is my ""go to"" packing item."
5,Great sturdy storage,"This Action packer is the third one I have purchased - it was for a family member for checked baggage for an overseas flight (the dimensions are exactly the maximum dimensions for checked baggage - I wonder how that happened......) Anyway, the airlines lost the Action packer for a week, but they couldn't break it - everything got there in great order. I have had other Action packers for over 10 years, and they are still going strong. If you need strong durable storage - this is it!"
5,Ideal Container for Indoor/Outdoor Use,"I was in search for storage on the tongue of my trailer. It's a long story but the usual storage boxes for trailer tongues don't fit my trailer.The containers are lightweight but durable. They seem to be water-tight, at least from road spray on rainy days.I cant imagine what else I could need!"
1,Don't be fooled by the item description,"This lotion is great, but don't be fooled by the item description. It is described as a case pack of 36, but it is only a single 3/4 ounce tube of lotion. I paid nearly $7, including shipping and handling, to get that one little tube of lotion. I rated this item 1-star only because there is no zero-star rating."
5,The Warhorse,"Don Bolognese has presented the romance of art and war placed in Renaissance Italy with exciting text and detailed illustrations. Hidden between the lines and behind the words the author has successfully described the ever present conflict of adolescent immediate gratification versus adulthood. It's absorbing and wishful, even lusty yet presenting the youthful reader with history while reassuring him/her that time can place us back on the right track, whatever and wherever that may be."
2,Refining erratic quirkiness,"2 1/2In the world of fractured indie songwriting, Deerhoof's TRF is a beguiling epic makring the crossroads of the band's old and new influences, but even a few years later a lot of whimsical mesmerization has worn off."
1,Someone crapped in my ear,I wish I could take the time back I wasted on listening to this bands albums so I could use it on more productive things like lighting my nipples on fire. I would have enjoyed it more.
1,More proof of P.T. Barnum's maxim,"I made it half way through before piercing my eardrums with sharpened pencils. If you can buy the karaoke version, this might be pretty good, otherwise you will get more artistry from the latest Yanni cd. The vocals are so twee even a kindergartner would blush in shame."
2,Frustrating book,"This book could have been great. That was what was so frustrating about it. The story itself unfolded over a time and space that was incredibly interesting. But the characters were never more than 2-diminetional. That was incredibly disappointing to me!So, if you don't care that you don't get more than a shadow of the person on the page, feel free to jump in. Otherwise, there are many better novels out there!"
4,The Linnet bird,"The Linnet bird started off a bit slow for me, but very soon I was hooked. I got to one chapter and did not want to read it as I guessed where it would lead and I did'nt want it to. I started reading slower just to allow the book to last longer. I loved the story of Linnet starting off a life under bad circumstances and making a decision that this is not the life she wants to live. She follows her heart and finds what she is looking for even if it is for only a short period of time. A book of hope and heartache...sorry it ended. A must read"
3,The Linnet Bird,"I initially did not think I would enjoy the book and I also felt the descriptions were pretty ""raw"" is spots and not the type of book I would want to share with younger readers. However, as I got further into the story, I did enjoy the book and was willing to overlook some of the parts that I found objectionable."
3,OK Read--Not Comparable to Moonlit Cage,"After reading The Moonlit Cage I just had to follow up with some more of this author's historical fiction! While The Linnet Bird has very real(and depressing!) imaging from the British Empire/slums and India during the early 1830's, I found it a bit 'contrived' in parts..or should I say the circumstances that the heroine seems to conveniently find herself in and saved from--a little unbelievable. Having said that--the descriptions of India--the lifestyle and the culture of the British ex-pats--the effects of global expansion and colonialism--as well as unbridled capitalism at home--really well written and reflected--the pain, the excess--if you were lucky--and the rigidly defined social strata for women.Worth a read--as I am glued to it every night at bedtime--but if you haven't read this author--get The Moonlit Cage first!"
2,The cartridge didn't work.,"The cartridge would not work - my printer continously said to ""insert cartridge"". It also appeared as though the cartridge had already expired based on the expiration date stamped on the front.I returned the cartridge and was pleased at the full refund from Amazon."
4,Moving,"This is a well-acted, poignant film, though I'm not convinced that it is an authentic portrayal. It seems to say that the vulnerable country folk are manipulated by the intrusive Nazi menace, destroying the formerly pleasant relations they had with the Jew, Levi. But Germany, like most of Europe has a savage and repetitive history of anti-semitism that preceded the Nazis by hundreds of years. Ostracism and violence against Jews were not unusual, they were only more overt at some times than others. So, would Levi have felt so apparently confident in his dealings with the villagers? The director perhaps assumes that viewers will have a familiarity with European anti-semitism that most do not."
3,propaganda??,"This DVD, originally titled ""Vieh-Jud Levi"" in German, is good, but not great. The story is captivating, especially the romance that develops between Levi and a young farm girl. I was very disappointed in the stereotypical portrayal of Levi. In this respect the movie was more a propaganda film than a story about a Jewish man in the German countryside at the time of World War II."
3,Well. . .,"I bought this movie for my girlfriend, who is a super fan of this anime. At first she was happy to see a movie of an anime she like. But it was only a concentrate version of the whole thing, making it boring to those who saw the complete serie. And as always, the short version is less interesting than the detailed one. So watch this movie if you never saw this serie and you are curious about it, but don't buy this if you already possess the serie."
5,Excellent resource for anyone ministering cross culturally,"Great book, not just a bunch of mission stories. These principles in this book will impact your ministry and your cultural sensativity."
4,This book will help you understand why you are not understood!,This book give good information and examples of how people from different cultures misunderstand each other. And some of it funny; some is cringe-worthy; and some of it has been experienced by me. I found this book to very practical. I will be adding some insights from this book to my cultural awareness classes. I appreciate the author's broad perspective on basic human inter-relational characteristics. This book will increase your understanding while helping to decrease misunderstandings and confusion working/living in another culture.
4,Good,"A little too ""wordy"" but good. Made some good points about issues as they relate to cultural dynamics and how they influence interpersonal/social relationships."
5,TOP NOTCH,"AS USUAL,TOP NOTCH MUSIC FROM A TOP NOTCH BAND.GET IT & ROCK.RECORDED VERY WELL.I HAVE MOST OF WHAT THEY'VE DONE.THINKING OF GETTING THE DELERIUM YEARS 2CD SET BUT HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT SOME OF THE REVIEWS THAT IT MAY BE TOO MELLOW,BUT I TOOK A CHANCE WHEN I BOUGHT THE FIRST CD BY PT WHICH WAS SIGNIFY AND WAS VERY VERY PLEASED WITH WHAT I HEARD.I'VE BOUGHT ALMOST EVERYTHING I COULD GET MY HANDS ON SO FAR.I WAS ONLY DISAPPOINTED WITH ONE CD THAT I BOUGHT AND THAT WAS ON THE SUNDAY OF LIFE.NOT MY STYLE.ALSO YOU MAY WANT TO LOOK AT BLACK FIELD ,GREAT 2CD SET.ALSO THERE IS A BOOTLEG 2CD SET CALLED NEARFEST 2000 THAT IS VERY CLOSE TO THIS (WARSZAWA).WE NEED MORE OF THIS TYPE OF MUSIC ON THE AIRWAYS.OH YEAH IF YOU LIKE THESE GUYS YOU'LL LOVE RPWL.THIS CD REALLY ROCKS THOUGH SO GO OUT AND GET IT.I REALLY LOVE ALL THEIR MUSIC,THESE GUYS ARE FANTASTIC.."
5,Excellent Reading,"When I picked up this book, I simply could not put it down. It is superbly written and I highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in sports. Dr. Svare has put into words what I have been trying to say about the sports culture and it growing negative influence on our society. Like Dr. Svare, I was once a rabid follower of sports and unconciously participated in the exploitation of young men and women through our runaway sports culture. It took some of my own negative experiences to finally wake me up to the train wreck that will eventually happen. The clock is really running out and Dr. Svare presents some sad stories about how sports has corrupted our society, but also he give realistic solutions that can help truly reform sports before the clock runs out.Dr. B. David RidpathMarshall University"
3,Be careful regarding the width,"I have worn Rockport shoes for years, and have found them wonderful for my feet and very long lasting. This is the first time I have bought shoes online and I made an error in the size. I wear 9D, but I mistakenly believed that 9M = 9D. The shoes have been a little tight. For myself, I'm thinking that I might prefer buying shoes in a store. As a suggestion, it would be helpful if there were a cross reference to the ABCDE shoe width historical sizing to a Medium/Wide sizing."
4,Light colored - good value,"These are a good deal and very comfortable, high quality shoes (as with most Rockports). I would caution that it is predominantly a lighter tan than the pictures seem to show."
4,"Good quality, half a size too big","I loved the shoes, very good quality, exactly as I imagined them, but I have a little recommendation you should take into account: take a size half a size smaller than you normally use."
5,An Excellent Read,Another great McMurtry novel. Tied up all the loose ends of Lonesome Dove and was just as exciting as all the previous novels in the series. A great read!!!
5,"It's not Lonesome Dove, but still VERY good","At first I wasn't sure I could get into it, Lonesome Dove set the bar pretty high, but after the first few pages I was back into the characters (old and new). Well done! A must if you want to follow up with Call, Lorie, and Pea."
5,"This novel is a powerful, character-driven work.","This is the first book I've ever read by Larry McMurtry, and I was captivated. I really found myself caring a great deal what happened to the characters in this book. I was impressed by the author's ability to make a character real and extremely individual. There were no stereotypes in this book. Each person seemed so real and alive. This is what kept the pages turning for me. McMurtry is a true marvel. I have gotten so dead sick of prose-concious writers, who seem to flood the scene these days. In this work, I never felt the writer patting himself/herself on the back for some beautiful line, as I do in most modern novels. I never sensed ""the writer"" at all. I was just swept along by a great storyteller and a great story."
4,Excellent sequel to Lonesome Dove,"This was an excellent novel. I had a hard time putting it down. Not quite as rich as Lonesome Dove, but certainly a very enjoyable read."
5,Fine Novel of the Old West,Larry McMurty has written the follow on to Lonesome Dove. The characters are a bit older and slowing down while going after a cold blooded killer Joey Garza. Reading this book you can feel the cold and sense the desolate nature of west Texas. I found it hard to put down and if you like western novels I highly recommend it.
1,The book that should have never been,"I came onto the series a little late and I loved Lonesome Dove. I could not wait to read this book. Well, that was then. This was the biggest piece of garbage. I had heard rumors that McMurtry was angry over Return to Lonesome Dove (Who wouldn't be angry?), but he was bitter and this book 100% shows that! He did a hatchet job on Lonesome Dove in this book. The names may be the same, but the characters are not! He did not stop there, he killed off characters his fans rooted for and loved out of spite and it shows. I couldn't even make it through the whole book. I ended up throwing it in the goodwill box after a few chapters. This is a good example of what not to do when you are bitter and irrational. If he would have just written this book like that stupid made for tv sequel never happened his fans would have been thrilled. Don't read this book if you loved Lonesome Dove, this book will be a total disappointment."
1,Disappointment,"I found this book to be a huge let down. How can you follow up a Pulitzer Prize winner without some disappointment? He should have left it alone. The characters were flat. The story line poorly planned out. The relationships unbelievable. Everyone had either died off or married someone that they should never had a chance with (ex. Pea Eye marries Lori. In the first book she hated Pea, and he was so dumb.) Lonesome Dove was fantastic, while this book did it no justice at all. I wish I had never read it b/c the way it played out was not the way I saw things happening."
5,Streets of Laredo,"I loved Lonesome Dove - McMurtry is an excellent writer taking the reader inside of the action where emotions, pain, fury all can be felt. I was disappointed in myself that Lonesome Dove was the second in a series - would have liked to have read Comanche Moon first.This book - Streets of Laredo - although written with all of the emotion and fury that is so wonderfully done by McMurtry - was a disappointment to me in that this man, Woodrow Call, had spent his entire life helping make the wild west a little tamer but culminating in a disappointing ending not making sense to me nor did it fit in with the ending he had so rightfully earned. Call deserved a better ending than McMurtry fit to allow him - beaten, no longer feeling proud of himself, relying on others - which was the last thing he would have wanted."
4,Unpredictable,"I really enjoyed this book, especially in how it contrasted with ""Lonesome Dove"". As a sequel, it really breaks from any expected pathways (set up by the end of last book) and takes off into its own uncharted territory. Just when you think things will go one way, it goes another. There is a bit of bittersweetness with one of the themes - the end of the Old West. The story progresses with the feel almost like in ""The Shootist"".The book is much darker, especially without Gus McCrae, but the story-line manages to bring him into the picture by the contrasts between him and Call. Overall, this theme is well done. Looking back to the first three books (Dead Man's Walk, Comanche Moon, and Lonesome Dove), one can see the line of development that has brought the (remaining) characters to this point. The story ends here - satisfying if not quite what you expect."
3,"Ok story, poor digital conversion","Streets of Laredo just didn't measure up in my opinion, compared to Lonesome Dove. The characters seemed shallow, and there was a lot of time wasted mentioning the back story from Lonesome Dove. Maybe if you hadn't read the original, or if it had been a while, that would be a good thing?Another beef I had were the numerous conversion errors / typos / errors. Sometimes several per page even. Most of the time you could figure out what the author meant but it was annoying regardless."
3,doesn't quite measure up...,"While it has been a while since I have read this book, after reading the other reviews, I may have to go back and read it again.I did not like the way that the author killed off my favorite characters from LD in the first few chapters. To get rid of Newt and Clara was just cruel. Newt especially could have developed into an awesome character.I also did not like the pairing of Lorena and Pea Eye. This was just too much of a stretch for me to believe. I would rather have her with Dish or even Newt. Pea Eye was just not who I would have picked for her.Granted, I am not the author and while I greatly respect Larry McMurtry and his work, I was disappointed with this.I also do not remember the ""man burner"" being in LD. Lorena said that he was in the gang that kidnapped her and after re-reading LD many many times, I still cannot find reference to him. I am going to have to buy Commanche Moon and read the whole series from start to finish."
3,Frank W. Dixon in Spurs!,"Streets of Laredo is the final lurid, trashy entertainment in the Lonesome Dove Series. McMurtry's fiction brings to mind that of the conglomerate known as ""Frank W. Dixon,"" creators of the Hardy Boys series. Just as the Hardy Boys were next to impossible for an eight-year-old to put down, McMurtry's work, though more adult in its telling, offers a similar edge-of-the-seat excitememt. Like the Hardy Boys, McMurtry's work is characterized by hokey plots, stick characters and a marked inability to integrate his themes with his story-telling, but despite all of this, again, like the Hardy Boys, he keeps the reader turning pages. Finally, like the Hardy Boys, McMurtry's fiction is eminently forgettable.Faulkner, it ain't, but for a good time in the ski lodge or at the beach, readers could do a lot worse."
1,Dull and Pointless,"McMurtry must have been paid by the word. Concepts, charactarizations and actions are recounted time after time, and they are often pointless and without interest or entertainment. It is painful to read such pointless drivel"
1,Words can't describe it!,"I bought four of McMurtry,s Lonesome Dove series books (Dead Man Walking, Comanche Moon, Lonesome Dove and, Streets of Laredo) after being delighted by the Lonesome Dove TV series. I always thought that a book was better than its corresponding movie, especially after producers and scriptwriters were finished doctoring things up. I bought this collection on that basis (Lonesome Dove)and was sorely disappointed. I can't imagine that the author received the Pulitzer prize for any of these stories. Each book was a little too raw for me and in each one, McMurtry seemed to be in search of a suitable ending; in short they were too long, inane and disjointed. Have you read any of Tony Hillerman or Zane Grey?"
1,Disappointing and Weak. A waste of time.,"I never imagined that I would read the best book I've ever read in my life and the worst book I've ever read in my life by the same author. Lonesome Dove was a capitaving, brilliant story, perhaps one of the best novels ever written. Streets of Laredo is terrible. It is one disappointment after another. McMurtry makes his first mistake when he kills any redeeming characters that survived through Lonesome Dove, leaving Captain Call and Lorena to guide the story. These two characters who are identifed by their quiet and shy personalities are not fit to guide a novel. They barely even speak! I'm sorry I wasted my time reading about two mutes and the dim-witted Pea Eye chase after a gang of weak characters. Bottom line, just stick with Lonesome Dove. I have tried to forget that I ever picked up this sequel."
3,"Do some research, Larry !",A good story marred by historical inaccuracy. Judge Roy Bean died of a combination of old age and alcoholism and outlived John Wesley Hardin by a good many years. JWH is depicted as a vicious killer even though he was a reformed character after being released from prison around the time the action takes place. He practised law and is unlikely to have even been in the area at the time. Mr McMurtry should read a little history - or use fictional characters.
2,Disappointment after the first book,"It has been a couple of years since I read this book but the ""BookMatcher"" recommended it to me and I had to comment on how disappointed I was when I originally read it. I don't normally read Westerns but I read Lonesome Dove before the mini-series was on television and loved it so much I chose not to watch the movie (it could never compare to the novel.) Sequels are rarely as good as the original book and this was no exception. The author seemed to forget his character. In Streets the characters where constantly doing things that you would never see them doing in the first."
4,"Bleak, bleak, bleak, but entertaining and admirable","Lonesome Dove was a wide-angle celebration of human struggle and human life--and about how people choose to live.Streets of Laredo is much more focused. It is about getting old and dying, or dying before you get the chance to get old. It's outrageously bleak in parts, but McMurtry's straightforward, slightly folksy style makes it almost humorous (there's a scene in which a young woman commits suicide by eating rat poison that had me chuckling).This relentless darkness will undoubtedly anger a lot of readers who love the first book. I liked it, because it is still a good story with good characters, and because I can't help but be impressed by a writer who would create a sequel that he knows will alienate many of his readers."
4,Bleak but Worth It,"McMurtry wrote this book while convalescing after heart surgery that left him, in his own words, shattered -- unable to write and devastated by depression. The book reflects that terrible time by bringing the characters of Lonesome Dove brutally down off of the romantic clouds readers and reviewers (and definitely not McMurtry) put them on after Lonesome Dove became a sensation. The character you'd expect to be the sequel's main character is dead before the book even begins, and Captain Call's deep decline is rendered in pitiless detail. But while Streets of Laredo is bleak enough that it sometimes feels like a Cormac McCarthy western, it's not a cheat -- McMurtry is true to his characters and offers a stark reminder that Lonesome Dove was also a brutal book. Resist the temptation to read it the second you finish Lonesome Dove, but read it."
1,Streets of Lumbago,"Nope. Didn't work. Not even close.McMurtry kills off most of the really interesting characters in Lonesome Dove - Gus, Newt, Deets, Jake. Then expects to make a sequel with the remainder? Clara and her ranch are absent from ""Streets"" with some plotlines left unanswered from LD (did July and Clara ever...?).Pea Eye marrying Lori??!! A villain who burns his victims alive??McMurtry is really stretching it here. He should have rested on his laurels for Lonesome Dove."
3,Streets of Laredo,"The writing by McMurtry was near perfect, as expected; but compared to Lonesome Dove it fell somewhat short. The continuation from the first novel to the second was glossed over in a few sentences in the first few chapters, and, to me, this was poorly accomplished. But, I must say, because of McMurtry's masterful style it was a satisfying read; and if one did not read LD this novel would be easily an excellent achievement. Sorry if I come across 'pulling both ways' but when a novel (LD) receives the Pulitzer Prize, it leaves a very high bar to reach for that next writing."
1,Absolutely Joyless,"First let me say I loved Lonesome Dove. I believe it's one of the best novels ever written. This, on the other hand, is far from it. All the things that made Lonesome Dove so great just aren't present here. The lyricism, the poetry, the sense of wonder are gone. Those things and all the interesting characters. This isn't giving anything away but almost all the interesting surviving character from Lonesome Dove dies before Streets of Laredo even begins. The few left are the ones that don't talk much. They have nothing interesting to say and very little interesting to do other than suffer. I'm not particularly interested in watching people suffer. Reading about it either. The first part of this book just recounts how everyone died in the intervening time. And that's the fun part. It gets worse from there, much worse. I've never been more happy to end a book."
3,Wish I Hadn't Read It!,"As an earlier reviewer stated, while this was a well written book, I wish I hadn't read it. Lonesome Dove ended with the hope of Newt beginning a proper father/son relationship with Call, and that July Johnson would begin a new life with Clara. With this book all the promise of reading about those relationships are dashed with the off camera deaths of both Newt and July! Totally lame! Then my sense of disbelief was heightened by the revelation that Lorena was now married to Pea Eye! WTF! I should have quit there. An unworthy ending to such a wonderful story. Stick to the prequels."
2,Kindle Version Poorly Copy-Edited,"The book is good, quite grim, without a lot of the charm of Lonesome Dove.That said, I was appalled by the poor quality of the copy-editing in the Kindle version. There was an entire stretch that felt like it had been OCR'd by an intern and put into the book without a second glance.I am by now well used to uncorrect-ed hy-phenation in Kind-le editions, but this was of such poor quality that one had to puzzle out the meaning of some of the words. 1 V/ant to read rny |(indle books, n0t decipher them.I knocked a star off this review for the poor production value."
3,Good but not great,"The author has delivered a good book that is appealing to readers. The ending is bizarre. Cut a man's leg off and walk 100 miles without him bleeding to death, farfetched. But otherwise a decent book.It's obvious that the author wishes to damage western sentimentality. All his novels have a bitterswwet flavor, with guaranteed tragedy at the end of the book to beloved characters. It's a shame he reduces the main character to such an unsatisfying ending.His side characters are less appealing than those portrayed in Lonesome Dove. And the book feels rushed at times. Why he chose 17 years post-Lonesome Dove limits our involvement in the story. Wouldn't 5 years post lonesome Dove been more appealing to his readers? A 70 year old bounty hunter in the 1800's. Not very appealing."
1,Very bad mastering,"I don't know why they decided to master this compilation this way, but I can barely turn it up to a moderate sound level. It is equalized so sharp and trebly, it is almost impossible to listen to. This is a real ear bleeder. Great music, terrible sound quality."
2,over-rated,They should just change the name of BEE THOUSAND to THE BEST OF GUIDED BY VOICES. The rest of their stuff is pretty mediocre if you ask me.
4,GUIDED BY VOICES,IT'S MY FIRST TIME DOING THIS BUT I HAVE BOUGHT 2 CD'S BY GUIDED BY VOICES -EARTHQUAKE GLUE AND THE BEST OF.THEY GROW ON YOU AND GET BETTER EACH TIME LISTENING TO THEM.NEVER HEARD OF THESE GUYS. HEARD THEM ON THE RADIO AND HAD TO INVESTIGATE.AL STEWART STILL IS THE MAN.
2,This is exactly what GBV sounds like,"This collection --- a CD completely filled with smart, simple rock songs --- continues the Robert Pollard ""shotgun"" method. He releases as many songs as he can, knowing that some of them will be winners. Dedicated GBV fans have the task of sifting through dozens of albums (and hundreds of songs) to find the cream of the crop. You'd hope that this compilation would do the sifting for the casual listener. But no. Out of 32 songs, less than half are keepers. The others are okay, but each is slightly off for one reason or another: bad production, too simple, too short, too little of something to make it worthwhile. Instead of a true 'best of,' this is a condensed version of the whole GBV catalogue."
1,"Chang, chang, chang, blah,blah,blah.","If this is the ""Best of GBV"", I can't imagine what their worst is like! Every once in a while I try to listen to these guys...mainly because someone tells me ""you would love GBV"". And everybody raves about these ""indie underground cult Gods"". I am sorry. But I find every song to be a complete, annoying repeat of the previous one: strummy guitars, sloppy drums low in the mix and warbly, whiny vocals blathering on about who-really-gives-a-damn. I pity the fools who get taken in by these kind of phony-baloney ""lo-fi"" artful wannabes. Played front to back, this album is the equivalent of turning your radio dial between stations: droning white noise."
5,"Probably the Greatest Best Of, of all time","Yes folks, you have your Beatles Double Disc greatest, but GBV is a band that has produced many albams which the majority believes has brilliant songs and then some not so brilliant songs muddled in.This takes their Best, and has to be considered The Greatest Greastest Hits album in Rock n Roll history, in my mind of course.So many other groups have those albums that you need to listen to the entire album to get it's full impact, and the hits album doesn't measure up.This is that once in a lifetime wierd exception.My recomendations would be to get this album, Earthquake Glue, and Half Smiles of the Decomposed, and you've got a hefty amount of incredible GBV material."
5,Good!,"These are original versions of the songs, sung by the original musicians, and it is great mix of dance tunes by familiar artists. The track list on the back of the case has a number after each song, indicating the highest chart position reached at time of print."
5,Great family fun,This was a great family film! I appear in it and it was also an inspirational experience. Worth the money and time!
5,Perfect Brush,"This is a great brush, not cheap looking and its great for bronzing. Handle is clear and solid. Love It"
4,A Great Blues Recording,"I heard ""Sail Away"" on the radio. A great version of this tune; maybe better than the original, given the heritage Brownie and Sonny bring to it. Love the banjo. So I investigated the rest of the recording and decided to add it to my collection of blues music. This music really moves, one tune after the next. Maybe not the traditional Brownie and Sonny that some expect, but how can you expect musicians like Brownie and Sonny to keep making the same music all the time. (Some hated it when Dylan showed up with an electric guitar, too.) It is a great selection of tunes. Try ""You Bring Out the Boogie In Me,"" ""Walkin' My Blues Away,"" ""Jesus Gonna Make It Alright,"" As I listen to this, I'm a white boy lost in the blues."
2,More like Laurence Welk plays the blues ...,"With all due respect to the reviews which follow, this is not Sonny & Brownie at their best. This is strictly a commercial cocktail party effort - and there's nothing wrong with that exactly. But by appealing to mainstream tastes we sacrifice the integrity of the blues for commercial gain. Believe me, I am no snob. It doesn't take a fine-tuned ear to hear in those back-up singers and drum pieces a cleverly-crafted effort to draw in rock fans. If it succeeds in turning on more people to the blues, fine. But I'd go elsewhere to get the genuine sound of these two terrific performers."
5,You People Are CRAZY,"This is one of the very first blues records I found in my dad's record collection when I was about 14. Yes it's not straight delta blues and yes it has some white guys playing/singing on it. This was Sonny and Brownie's introduction to white american blues fans in the early 70's and it worked. This record is a classic and totally worth the price of admission for the very last track of them telling road stories. Also their version of People Get Ready and Sail Away are near perfect.When I Met Brownie McGhee shortly before he passed away, he told me this was his favorite record he ever made. He thought this was the one he would be remembered for - so do yourself a favor and buy this amazing album."
3,Good--but is it the blues?,"I bought this album when I was in High School back in the '70s, after I'd purchased quite a few of Sonny and Brownie's older Folkways LPs. While I was genuinely surprised by the sudden turn from acoustic delta blues to what is essentially electric soul, for what it is, it's not horrible. However, Curtis Mayfield, Randy Newman, Sam Cooke and Michael Franks are hardly the kind of writers you would imagine S&B doing, but they do them here. Best tracks: ""Sonny's Thing,"" where Sonny's at his whoopin' and tootin' best, and their take on ""People Get Ready,"" which is a nice little jumping number. John Mayall stops by and gets in the way, as does Arlo Guthrie. Try the Fantasy re-releases of their 1960s-era stuff, or their earlier folkways albums, before you get this one."
4,"Not fish smelly, not gross!","I triedCrown Prince Brisling Sardines in Extra Virgin Olive Oil, 3.75-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)but it was fishy smelling. I thought I could handle the smell and the look (skin still on...head still on) but I couldn't. I'm a pretty tolerable person (I can eat chicken feet and balut) but opening my salad to a fishy smell and not wanting to take the time to marinate it in vinegar like Alton Brown made me continue searching.Behold, skinless boneless, no strong fishy smell, no face, 3 pieces of sardine (good size). Just what I can handle."
1,Not Worth It,Most expensive olive oil in the world. Three lousy sardines floating in a ocean of oil. The Season brand is a much better deal.
1,Much cheaper at Walmart,I only paid $1.62 for a can just like this at Walmart. That is why I gave it one star. These are overpriced.
1,Near impossible to open,"We bought 4 different types of sardine, and this can was the only one with the pull tab in a diagonal configuration, in a corner. This makes it impossible to open without twisting and deforming the can and splashing the oil, increasing the risk of cutting yourself. No matter how good the fish is, in this case the inconvenience and the danger ruin it for me. I will not buy this again."
5,Good sardines,"These are the same sardines as the ones named ""Natural"" I emailed Crown Prince asking what the difference was and they said only difference is labeling. The Natural are labeled as such to be sold at natural health food stores.Anyway, I've tried both and there really is no difference. The sardines are very delicate and delicious, no fishy smell at all. The amount of oil is just right because you can always pour it over salad and use that way."
2,INVASION by WHO?,They should have titled this TV series 'Body Snatchers II' or maybe thats already been done. My impression of this series 'Invasion' (I watched all of it) is that it is a parallel to the invasion of immigrants who have come to the United States illegally. One view of this problem seems to be to accept it because we can't do anything about it which appears to be the view concerning the aliess from outer space. Other than the political message I found the series very entertaining and well presented. The acting and directing and filming was very well done and it was an excellant sci-fi.
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"Buying this DVD set is a waste of money. Yes, I loved the series and watched every episode on TV. But then they canceled it. Why invest time and money in a series that ends with a major cliffhanger that will never be resolved? If you must see it, rent. The two-star rating is for these problems. The series itself rates 4-5 if it weren't for the cancellation with a seriously unresolved storyline."
2,Shame on me,"I should read those negative reviews before buying it, now I stopped at the 3rd disc after fast forwarded the last 2 episodes in disc 2. I completely agree with the others, that this is a very disappointing show indeed. Acting is good. Story is not.The 1st disc was actually not bad, but sadly, after a good establishment those writers just didn't find the right way to walk the story through.Whether this show has an ending is irreverent now because I won't finish watching it anyways.I *only* paid about $9.00 for it so I just think I paid an extra visit to BurgerKing - yeah I can do that."
2,A series too far......,"I must admit that I checked out this series after a review from a podcast (Slice of Scifi). They rated it as I have - starts of ok then fades away to something like Days of Our Lives, sadly.The script never seems to develop, while the actors seem to struggle with characters that border on the one dimensonal.It does have promise as an idea but runs out of steam in the script department. More suited to a mini series that has an end.Not that I am a friend of TV execs but I can see why this was canned after the first series.By the way - check out Slice of Scifi podcast - great info and entertainment.mw"
1,Disappointing,"Of the 3 new Sci Fi series that debuted on major networks that year, they were all cancelled in reverse order of how good they were. Threshold was the best so got cancelled first, then Surface & then Invasion. As a big Sci Fi fan, I watched all 3 series & Invasion was the only one I couldn't watch through to the last episode because it was so boring. The first episode was interesting & showed promise but after that I had to force myself to watch the following episodes, which were confusing & so dull I finally gave up towards the end. I wish they had continued Threshold & Surface, but Invasion just didn't do anything."
5,Cancelled before its time!,"I agree with the other reviewers, it seems like Sci-Fi programs such as Invasion and Surface never had the backing from the networks. ABC Execs should learn the difference between a series finale and a season finale. Give the viewers some closure, but no....back to stupid reality series.William Fichtner should be a household name! From 20 years ago on ""As The World Turns"", to movies such as ""Armageddon"" to programs ""Invasion"" to Fox being smart and snatching him up again for a sheriff role in ""Prison Break"", this is one talented actor."
5,Invasion rumor or fact??? show cancelation...,"If this is true that you have been told it wasd canceled, then goto abc.com and send a email to the programing dept. I did today...This is the best show on tv and the only one i look forward to the most..This show must go on...write abc.com (email)"
4,Invasion - The Complete Series,very good but due to hurricane katrina in the U Slots of scenes were cutUnfortunately Invasion only lasted one season
5,Product review.,"I am so excited to receive my complete series of Invasion. It is one of those shows that should have never been taken off the air. Anyway, I know there is a cliff hanger on the last show that I will never have the answers for but I will watch every episode again. The price was excellent and I still cannot believe it was a brand new set. Thank you, Kimberly"
4,Invasion - The complete series,"Even though some of the acting was somewhat less than stellar, the story line was quite interesting and the special effects showed some real inventiveness."
3,Too slow to be interesting,"Interesting concept and there are moments of believable tension, but overall too slow to really keep one locked into the series."
4,"Invasion, a good story","Loved it, it is a good story, some slow parts, did not get the ending, Is Larken dead? Is there a second season? I would like to know."
5,Invasion Not finished,"Invasion Not finished. They did not give it enough time.Great drama , intrigue and acting. A must have for any and all."
5,ANOTHER SUPERIOR SERIES DUMPED BY THE NETWORKS,"IT HAPPENS AGAIN. ANOTHER WELL DONE & ""EDGE OF THE SEAT SERIES"" BITES THE NETWORK DUST. WITH LUCK CABLE WILL SEE THE LIGHTS DROPPING OUT OF THE SKY & PICK-UP THE SERIES."
5,Write ABC,All fans of Invasion should go to ABC.com and send them a complaint email and ask them to reinstate this great show.
4,Great buy,For the money this set of DVDs can't be beat. I liked the series but it had been a long time since I had watched it and it was great to watch it without commercials.
3,A missed opportunity,"Invasion could have been a great show.Unfortunately, it was hamstrung by a weak cast and erratic writing.However, the cast when strong, is very strong. Tom and Dave save the show for me, especially Tom. The more I learn about the character, the more interesting he becomes. Get Invasion to watch Tom. The deputy Lewis is also engaging. One of the more sympathetic characters. Elisabeh Moss has her best role in Invasion - Mad Men or not. Unfortunately, the rest of the characters just don't measure up.The basic ideas are very good. The writers just don't seem capable of pulling it off consistently.The show does end with a cliffhanger. However, as I can't stand that character, it didn't really bother me.Wikipedia explains what was planned for season 2, per an interview with the actor who plays Dave. Did not sound good.Still, if you can find it on sale, grab it. Despite the flaws, Invasion did suck me in and kept me watching."
2,so so,Was better the first time around.Seems to be rather long in the tooth now.Just not engaging enough. too much time between action sceenes.
3,DONE TO SOON,"What a great show this was!!! Down fall; there should have been a second season. We were robbed of one of the best shows in years. Shame on the individuals that make decisions. The decision to not make a second season was a very, very, very bad one. Shame, shame, shame."
5,The Invasion is here,I loved this TV show when it was on air and just had to have it on DVD. It keeps you glued to the show and you don't want it to end.
5,Why was this cancelled?,"This show was so well written I have no idea why it was cancelled. One of the greatest series created next to LOST, 24, Prison Break and SURFACE. I was left totally wanting more. I hate that there are no answers to these questions, but still worth the watch. This show wasn't given it's chance to really shine. Replaced by bullsh@#t reality shows, by cheap networks that couldn't spread the cash to put out something worth watching! The writers strike is over, so lets see some well written shows! Bring back Invasion!"
1,two hour movie stretched to make a series,"As a two hour movie the basic sci-fi concept might have worked, but it was apparently stretched, very thin, by filler to make a series. Lots of dead end sub plots which make the people of the area look like their drinking water is piped in from a lead mine. Real loser, do not waste your money."
2,I can't believe what you guys are saying,"I bought this DVD after reading your stupid reviews. So, you guys think this is a great show, huh?I can't believe it. I really admired the actors on the show... they did great job. Without them, I could give this DVD 0 star if I could. All the actors are great .....except one.... The Latino guy trying to look like Antonio Banderas... Every character is annoyingly stupid and reckless. No wonder it was canceled after only one season. I got 1 more episode to see now... the only reason that I'm still watching is I want to make sure that all these stupid people are dead as they are supposed to be."
5,Invasion - a woman's opinion,"I'm a 32 year old housewife and probably don't fit the norm for this type of genre, but I have to say this was a fabulous scif-fi show! I anxiously awaited a new episode every week. It tortured me when the show went on hiatus during this past December.The storyline is definitely interesting and, unfortunately due to cancellation by ABC, wasn't developed quickly enough. The season finale (.....ooops, series finale) leaves you with a fantastic cliffhanger.I certainly hope that the ""powers that be"", recognize what a great show and story this was and finish it out for us! This show was too great to just dump and run!"
4,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed when this series was taken off the air. We loved it and watched it every week. In my niavety, when I saw Invasion, the complete series, I thought it meant that it had been all finished in filming and even though it was cancelled we could buy it and watch it anyhow. Boy, am I glad I read all the reviews and editorals first! What a ripoff. Now, I am disappointed all over again."
5,I can't believe this series was cancelled!,"I just finished a 1 week marathon of the 22 episodes of this incredible tv series, and I just can't understand why was cancelled. Excellent scripts, great performances, beautiful locations, mysteries unsolved in each episode, and they go and cancel the show...? Stupidity seems to be the norm in tv studio executives. A total shame because I will have loved to watch much more of this story that have got me hooked to the tv throughout an entire week.A lot of awful shows still airing shameful seasons and the good ones got cancelled. Mad tv world!If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it to you. But don't expect a conclusion because the series finale was ment to be continued..."
3,DVD - Invasion,The dvd was in very good condition (new) and I am very satisfied with this transaction. Too bad the Invasion series was cut short because it left us wanting more. Overall very good transaction.
5,Amazing Invasion,"I think this was one of the most seductive TV series, it held you spellbound until the next episode, very dismayed that there was no new series."
4,It's A Shame It Only Lasted One Season,"I really liked this series. I started watching because I am a new fan of William Fichtner. I eventually found myself liking Eddie Cibrian's character the best.I'm just sorry it was cancelled. It would have been nice if the creators knew the series was going to be axed (Like with American Gothic) so they could have wrapped things up.All in all, it was a great show with a great cast that kept my attention."
5,If Your Competition Reads This and You Don't...,"...you'll never know what hit you.Reaching Boomers looks easy, but it's not. Marketing executives, both young and experienced, make too many mistakes when trying to sell to Baby Boomers. Do it wrong, and this cash-rich market will totally ignore what you have to say.In this book, Brent Green shows you how to get their attention and make them reach for their wallets."
2,Odd Duck,"I must be the odd duck judging by the other reviews, but this book was very average. The words like ""scurry, hurry, plunk,"" ""pitter, patter, scatter,"" and ""mumble, stumble, bump."" seemed like nonsense and words my daughter didn't need to learn at 18 months. My daughter loves ducks and let this book sit untouched after initial readings for about 10 month until she was 2. She now likes the pictures, which are great and colorful. Also the plastic ducks float upside down in the bathtub. If you want great colorful pictures, I would rate this as 5 stars. But as a total package, I rate it a 2."
5,Best book ever!!,This book got me through paramedic college. Very hard to find in Ontario was very pleased to find it on amazon. Great condition!!!
4,Darn Good Start!!!,"... Jonny Lang, is the best thing going in blues today and getting better with each new release! His great, emotion filled voice compliments his excellent playing ability, perfectly! Listen to ""Breakin Me"" on his ""Wander This World"" CD, outstanding! Let's see what Mr. Green has to say, in about 10 years, when Jonny is recognized as a living legend, now he's only a living treasure!(I see Mr. Green has deleted his negative comments, smart move!) I only gave ""Lie to Me"" 4 stars, because ""Wander This World"" is even better. Jump on board the Lang train and hold on, this guy is going places. Mr. Green, however, will be stuck in the conservatory with the candlestick holder!"
5,Great!,"I don't get why people bother Mr. Lang about his voice and guitar skills and the fact he doesn't sound like John Lee Hooker. He's 19 years old!! For his age, he extremely talented."
3,A bit of a let down,"I was really hoping this album would be just chock-full of Lang riffing away alongside that tough voice of his. Although it's not a bad album, I was just expecting better considering his later releases. He was so young; I hate to be so critical. I'm glad I bought it though...it's good , but I just can't seem to give higher than a 3. This album just shows the potential...he's grown so much as an artist since this one. Still, a good addition to your Blues catalog."
1,What's he know about the blues?,"Just another long haired white guy with a Stratocaster. If this is blues I'm John Wayne. It took Buddy Guy 30 years to get the recognition this wanna-be got after one album. I know Buddy can't stand him even if he guested on ""Heavy Love"" Although I did have the cd at one time I have since sold it and I'll never buy anything from him again. Do yourself a favor and buy an album from someone who at least had to work for a living at one time in their lives."
1,Don't wast your money,"This album is total crap. I don't understand this idea that he sings and plays beyond his years. He sounds exactly like a 16 year old kid who has no business singing or playing the blues. If you enjoy waterdowned blues and bastardized versions of great blues songs (his cover of ""Good Morning Little School Girl"" must have been some sort of sick joke), this album is for you."
1,1 good song,There is only 1 good song on this CD. OK! It's a great song. But there is only 1! So there! Buy the single.
1,Wank on wonderkind.,"It all begins with the vocals and Jonny ain't got it yet. Fretboard flash without a point will put people to sleep as lots of us have learned. If you think he's the real deal, then you have a whole world of great music still to discover. Enjoy."
1,Monkey spanking Blues!!!,"Compressed gas from the start to finish. Overwrought piffle. Not a bad sound at times but just plain BAD - like Michael Bolton. His White House performance was simply awful. The more things change, the more they stay the same."
1,Blues Candy,Not a good record. Not a good blues player despite obvious musical talent. There's a TON of great blues out there; this guy is strictly Blues-Lite. He can wail and moan all he wants but it's still pap.
4,Great major label debut,"It's amazing how much disdain these ""purists"" have for Jonny Lang. What a bunch of elitist snobs. They seem to think he can't possibly be talented just because he's a kid. When blues masters are saying the guy has chops, who are these clowns to say different? I'm no blues afficionado, but this kid can bring it. And if nothing else, maybe he'll turn some younger listeners on to the rest of the blues world. Would that be bad? Stow the whining and complaining just because he's been successful and your little blues band toils in obscurity."
4,Blues and Jazz,This album is a great change from today's young artists. Mr. Lang is from another era.
4,J Lang,Good album for a young kid this is pretty amazing bought it for the title song other songs are just as good in my opinion If you like the blues good buy
5,Unreal for his age,Jonny Lang's first release showed his musical talent and demonstrated his guitar and vocals skills. This CD is fantastic and shows promise for an upcomming star.
4,Jonny Lang,Lany is a master 6 string player no doubt. This recording documents the facts. His voice is young and his age leads one to wonder if he has had time to feel that pain. Jonny Lang and the Big Bang is a much better compliation of his abilities.
4,Patchy and sometimes forced,"It is interesting that at the time of writing this review some six years after buying the album, Jonny has not yet produced another album since 'Wander this world' in 1998! I still enjoy very much some of the cuts such as 'A quitter never wins', 'Lie to me', 'Darker side' and 'There's got to be a change' which highlight his guitar playing. However many of his vocal offering now sound forced and strained. Some of the lighter tracks are also reasonable but generally the album does not excite me as it did on release. There are some live cuts I have which better illustrate his talents. I still await a more mature Jonny Lang album which demostrates his progress in the blues."
5,This is one FANTASTIC cd.,"This kid is really going places. I'm a 52 year old male. When I first put this cd in my car it played constantly, except for the news, for three weeks. This kid has a full complement, including the horns and the girls, to back him up. The fidelity is super and I just can't get enough of this cd."
3,ok,The kid's ok and that's all I'll give him. He lacks the heart and raw funk of a great blues guitarist. The CD is worth purchasing but don't expect to be moved in the Hendrix Red House sorta way.
3,Jonny Lang,I'm not thrilled by this album. I like Lang's bluesy renditions but I would have liked a few more cuts that have the energy of the title song.
2,"NEWSFLASH: This ain't blues, but...","I don't want to be too hard on this guy because his music is better than most of the garbage on FM radio, so I'll be breif. He is young and it shows. Sure he can play a few decent licks, but his vocals are atrocious. In about 30 years he may be able to crank out some decent blues. TIP: taste and feel is EVERYTHING, don't abuse the wah. On the positive side, maybe if they think this is blues, some of the younger crowd will seek out historical recordings of the many real and by far superior blues artists."
1,"Read Marya Hornbacker's ""Wasted"" instead.","Not wasting anymore than I need to on this book, I leave you with its ultimate summary: contrived."
3,Mixed feelings,"I purchased this book along with a few others aimed at recovery. This book described the author's journey into and out of her eating disorder and contained a lot of background research and other useful information at the relevant points throughout. For my stage of recovery, I thought that the intricate details of the eating disorder were a bit close to home and rather depressing. I have enough insight not to have my ED triggered by such things but fear some others may not be so inured and may discover some ""tips"" which could strengthen the hold of their EDs. I felt a little lacking in hope when I came to the end but I have been reading Carrie's blog for a while and know that the story continues and is very much an inspiration to me. Carrie's research throughout the book and on her blog is always informative and right up to date with current theories about EDs. I would recommend going to the blog EDbites as I think it much more pro-recovery."
1,Speed spool,It stinks till they fix it don't buy one trust me line get warped Around head and stalls motor Junk junk junk junk that is all I can say hope this is 20 words!
1,Look elsewhere,"I bought this a 2 years ago and was having trouble with the bump head. I wanted to replace it with a new universal one but you cannot. There is no way to do it, now I have nothing more than a noise maker that does nothing. Look else where and buy a brand you can replace parts on because Troy Built does not let you."
1,PLEASE SAVE YOUR CASH,"This is the worst piece of lawn and garden equipment that I've ever bought (and I have a lot). I can't wait until it completely stops working so I can buy something else. This junk started screwing up just after 3 house trims...leaking oil from the air filter, loss of power and not idling. $60 bucks in repair shop and had to upgrade trimmer head $50...still malfunctioning after 1 month. Cost me 30 to 45 minutes extra time per cut messing with this product."
1,another mistake,I went to Lowes looking for the best gasoline weedeater. Advised by the garden area expert I purchased the Troy Bilt 575ec. It never ran properly. loosing power. I returned it for the same one thinking it was a lemon. The second one had problems with the head and kept getting the string tangled inside. Lowes replaced it without any problem. My 3rd one developed a severe oil leak after less than 10 hours use. I disassembled it and found a crack in the casing. I will be returning it to Lowes to see what can be done. If it can't be returned I will be leaving it in their dumpster. Troy Bilt is off my good list.
1,Garbage,"I wish I read the reviews prior to purchase. After less than a year of light use the pull start became fouled up, so I had it brought in for warranty repair. I am now approaching 3 months and still do not have my machine. The shop advised that TroyBilt uses MTD for their parts, and based on their experience, either you get the part right away or it takes forever. I was told it would be a few weeks initially...3 months (and possibly counting) is completely unacceptable. I was told Stihl or Husqvarna are the way to go. I will NEVER buy another TroyBilt product."
1,Troybilt trimmer--a real dog!,"I bought a Troybilt rototiller years ago and found it to be a solid performer. It was extremely well built, easy to start, and worked extremely well. When I needed a new trimmer, I thought I'd go with a Troybilt product because of my previous experience. Well, this trimmer is a major disappointment. On my first outing, the head fell apart and the not all of the parts could be found. I contacted Troybilt and found new parts were out of stock. I ended up waiting 4 weeks to get a new head. This time, the string fed out constantly rather than only when the head was bumped--and it fell apart also. This, along with an engine that was very hard to start caused me to unload this lemon and buy a Stihl. I think when MTD took over, the quality really deteriorated."
1,junk!!!!!!,"i have had a lot of time on a weed eater. i live on a large farm and have had lot of time this is the biggest piece of junk on the place. it is heavy,under powered , adn does not run smooth at all. i do not recommend this weed eater to anyone."
1,What a Disappointment,I am getting ready to return this unit to Lowes. It is the worst starting piece of equipment I have ever owned. It takes many brisk pulls of the starter rope (ten or more) to get the engine running. This piece of equipment should not be on the market.
1,Watch your weeds (and your biceps) grow !,"A friend of mine bought one of these (new) for our church. It is extremely difficult to start, both when it is cold and when it has been running. It appears to be starved for fuel since it starts OK if primed with starting fluid. The spark is fine, the plug is gapped correctly, the carb is totally clean with no blocked orifices. You can adjust the idle but not the mixture. Your best bet (unless you use starting fluid) is to keep on pulling, praying and prostrating yourself before the Lord, begging forgiveness for the new cuss words you create. Then, it might just start.If it does, God help you if you shut it off."
1,Nothing but trouble,"Extremely difficult to start. I've followed the instructions to at ""T"" and usually have to use starting fluid to get it going.The ""bump to feed line"" feature sucks. When I bump it on the ground it feeds way too much line, thus wrapping around the shaft and stalling. I'm using the correct (.095) line.I've had string trimmers for many years and this is by far the worst. I should have taken it back to Lowes when I purchased it but I thought I'd give it a chance - what a mistake.I believe Troy-Bilt was purchased by another company - that's often the kiss of death for a good product line - it certainly was in this case. As another reviewer stated, ""I wish I could rate with no stars"" - I concur."
1,Junk...,"CAVEAT EMPTOR wrote:""Save your money!!!!! After going thru cheap gas trimmers like disposable lighters, I thought I'd bite the bullet and buy a good one. Well, after spending $199.00 for this troy built, I thought this would last me a while. WRONG!!!""Thought he'd bite the bullet and buy a good one... What a joke!!! If you want a good one, look and see what the Lawn Care Pros are useing... Bet it won't be a POS Troy Built...."
1,Garbage,"I bought my trimmer from Lowe's on March 15th 2007, I was using it on 4/20/2009 (warranty ended on 3/14/2009), heard a loud noise and it abruptly stopped, oil began running out of the power head, that's generally not a good sign. Just ordered me an Echo, I hear those work.......I will never purchase another Troy built or MTD product again, I should have learned my lesson after my MTD riding lawn mower purchase."
1,Bad pull start,"Even though my trimmer is just starting it's third season, I've used it less than a dozen times. For my first use this summer, it was a little difficult to pull the starter cord. After about the third pull, the starter stripped out. I called Troy-Bilt and the service technician said I probably didn't properly maintain the engine. Even though my trimmer is two years old, it's not had any use to speak of. What happened to being able to buy a quality product?"
1,Many problems,"Like many reviewers this trimmer has given me trouble that no one seems to be able to fix. The trimmer is almost three years old and the head spits out about two feet of line every time you rev the engine. Replacing the inner spool, cleaning the head, using different string, etc., made no difference. Talking with Troy-Bilt tech support was not helpful. The service tech knew less than I did about the design of the head. So now I have a perfectly good motor on one end and a useless string trimmer on the other. I should mention this problem started suddenly. Prior to the line spurting out the unit functioned very well. It still starts easily. When new, it was hard to start and would quit frequently. As it got more broken in it ran flawlessly. The trimmer IS HEAVY. If you are a bit frail get something lighter."
4,It works well,"This trimmer is working well for me. You do need to pay attention to the instruction manual though. It starts well and loading more trimmer line is easy, once you do it the first time. The power is good, but wear your hearing protection.The decision between a straight shaft or a curved shaft is important. For me, the straight shaft is good 80% of the time, but puts me in awkward positions for the remaining 20% of the time. I had a curved shaft before, and wished for a straight shaft about 40% of the time, so there is no simple answer. It depends upon your height and the way that you use the trimmer.I had a corded, electric trimmer before and needed more power and distance from the nearest plug, so the gas unit is perfect. I chose the 4-cycle to avoid the gas/oil mixing, and that was a good decision.All in all, it is a very good purchase, so far."
1,Troy bilt difficult to use for more than a few minutes,I purchased a TB575ss from Ace Hardware. Took the first one back because it would not start. the replacement started but it starts missing and the power drops if I use it for more than a few minutes. Then it becomes harder and harder to start. If I let it cool down it works better but never as good as the first few minutes of the initial start. Very frustrating to use and get my work done in a timely manner. I would never recommend Troy-Bilt products if my weed eater is an indication of how their products perform.
1,worst trimmer I ever owned,This is the worst trimmer I have ever owned. Impossible to start. Troy bult is now making junk. I will never ever buy another of their products. Very cheaply made. The spring assist starter does not seem to exist. Troy bilt should change their name to boy bilt. A child must have designed this
5,Very nice earrings,"I bought these to wear on my wedding day. My necklace was real pearls and these were not, but no one could tell! They really were stunning. Worth every penny!"
5,Beautiful Earrings,These earrings look even better in person. I bought them to wear on my wedding day and I can't wait. They will go perfectly with my dress.
5,Great Value,I ordered these earrings to wear for Xmas. These earrings were less then 20.00 but look expensive. I received many compliments on them and family could not believe the bargain I received. They are lightweight and do look very classy and elegant.
2,earings,"the earrings looked exactly like they look on line. However in my rush to go away for Christmas I did not open the package before leaving home. When I opened, I saw that only one earring had the hook on it. I could not wear it at all. I had already destroyed the package in which it was mailed and I do not know my options. SO one earring looks great but no hook on the second earring."
3,thought they were smaller,"These earrings are nice, but the pearl is huge and super white. They are not as elegant as I was hoping."
5,"SCER155 Sterling Silver Leverback 1.5"" Long Drop Earrings Made with Swarovski Elements","These earrings are beautiful, exactly like what is pictured. Just what I was looking for to go with a pearl necklace that I have."
3,"A little overpriced, but nice.","The best part of these earrings is that they are stamped 925 and are Sterling Silver. The pearl looks synthetic if you look close, but usually folks don't get that close so they work for almost any type of outfit. I think the price is little high, but I wanted that particular style earring and went for it. Packaging and shipping time were no problems for me. It arrived quickly and well packaged. I got these shipped free with the rest of my order; I wouldn't have paid extra to have them shipped."
1,not as pretty as shown,This is a crappy item. You could have gotten this item elsewhere with no more than 5 dollars. Don't ever buy it if you can avoid it!!
4,"great product, great price","I have previously ordered earrings from this site, and have consistently been very happy with the products and service. They offer great products at very reasonalbe prices."
4,Pretty,Got this for my wife as a quick gift. She is picky with her jewelry so I was glad she liked it. The product itself is of good quality. No rough edges or anything else to make it look as inexpensive as it is sold for.I would suggest getting a nicer box to give present it with. The box it comes in isn't the nicest.
2,Not impressed,"I didn't really like the taste of the clams, and the consistency. I wish I could have tasted it with just one jar before I ordered a pack, I kinda read the reviews and thought I would like it, but I didn't. And now I am stuck with 10 cans ( I managed to eat 2 with pasta, where its taste is barely noticeable). I guess, I will just add it to salads and pasta as a source of protein, but make sure i can't taste it. Not liked. :("
2,less clams,"Compared to other brands of same weight, this product has less clams and more water. Quality of meat was ok just less quantity."
5,Overlooked Great Read!!!,"It is always shocking to read a fantastic book that no one knows about. """"Those the Sun Has Loved"" is out of print while there are shelves loaded with junk in bookstores. This is absolutely one of my favorites stories. To quote a 4/27/2010 article eulogizing Rose Jourdain by Janet G. Messenger in the Evanston Roundtable, ""Those the Sun Has Loved"" is a saga of romance, war, politics, adventure and family with history folded in. It stretches over 200 years and seven generations of a free African American family, from 1773 in Surinam on the north coast of South America to the 1970s in the United States."" This is a book the reader will not be able to put down once it is begun. There is NO one whom I have shared this book with over the years who did not love it, also."
3,Great historically based fiction....,I read this book 25 years ago - it was a book found in a flea market and about 6 women in my family passed the book around which is how I got a chance to read it. It stayed with me over the years and I often searched for it with no luck. I was quite surprised when I found it this summer - this is the first book I've re-read for pleasure. I'd love to see his made into a movie. Now to my thoughts about the book....I loved the story line - the story covers a family who through one of its matriarchs crossed the color line and concurrently unified the complexity of race. Fabulous read.My rating is based on the writing - lots of errors in the book. Not the best writing but the storyline was intriguing and captivating. I recommend you read for the joy of the story not the writing skill. This would make an excellent movie!
3,It Depends What Aquinas You Want,"G.K. Chesterton is a great writer and a generous man, but I have not known him to be described as a great scholarly writer. So it goes with this book. Whether you find it worthy depends upon what kind of writing you want: a fine narrative or a scholarly work. If the former, you will be well rewarded. It is a good read and it ""sets the table"" for understanding Saint Thomas, the man. Personally, I was looking for more on Saint Thomas, the extraordinarily gifted theologian and philosopher."
3,"Good subject, good wordsmanship, narrow breadth","A vigorous exposition of the available biographic information on St. Thomas Aquinas. A basic introduction to some of his philosophy. Presents some of the towering achievements of this medieval scholar made relevent to the early 20th century. Explains why he has left out the Angelic Doctor's Theology, which is actually the most interesting aspect of the Dumb Ox. Unfortunate and superficial rejection of other belief systems living up to the authors own words: ""..it is generally the man who is not ready to argue [intelligently], who is ready to sneer."""
1,Purple hagiography,"As other reviews have stated, one gets the strongest possible dose of Chesterton, only the vaguest, yet thoroughly adulatory hagiography of Aquinas. His habit of rhetorical paradoxicalism wears thin rather soon. At one point, the strong influences of the Arab philosophers promised some interest, both historically and philosophically, but soon we were back to the amazing shyness and amazing amazingness of the Saint, who had the distinction of asserting that Catholicism involved reason, in the face of actual reason wafting in from the ancient world by way of Aristotle.All in all, thoroughly dated, both in Chesterton's gushings and reflexive Catholic jingoism, and the underlying philosophy, such as it is, of Aquinas."
1,"St. Thomas Aquinas ""The Dumb Ox""",I disliked this book very much. I have just recently read it and maybe my version is different. (I read the 1933 version of the book) I would have liked it better if Mr. Chesterton had gone into more detail about St. Thomas Aquinas. He was very wordy not getting to the point and at several points in the book he bored me to tears. So thats my review i am a religion student in high school so you may not regard me as you would an older person but I have read a great many books by great authors who I have praised but this book I think was no written as it shoud've been.
1,not a good book,I wanted a book describing the life of St. Thomas Aquinas. This is not that book. It goes more into his philosophy's and studies rather than focusing on his life. I already read a book about his philosophy - he has written many himself. I wanted to learn about the person. This book did not talk much about the man who became a saint.
2,Disappointing,"G. K. Chesterton is one of my favorite authors; ""Orthodoxy"" and ""The Everlasting Man"" are among the most thought-provoking books that I have ever read. Nevertheless, this biography of St. Thomas Aquinas was disappointing. Chesterton is, as usual, not lacking in wit, but his wit often overshadows the content. It is clear that Chesterton thinks very highly of Aquinas, but I often felt that much of his characterization was fanciful. His description of Aquinas didn't seem to contradict many of the facts that he presented, but neither did the facts justify his description. Also, the organization of the book was poor; it is topical not chronological, but its topics are not developed well enough to stand on their own. I cannot recommend this book because after reading it, my knowledge of Aquinas and his impact on philosophy, theology, and the church is still poor."
1,House on Haunted Hill,I never received this product in the mail (House on Haunted Hill with Vincent Price) and would very much like a refund!
5,A Great Book,"This is the 1980 Crescent Books Edition of Major Myatt's Book.This is a very large book divided into sections from Flintlocks to Self-Loading Pistols. Each of the six sections has a very well written introduction. Two firearms are presented on each page, and the pictures are nothing short of spectacular. Each firearm's major characteristics (dimensions, caliber, etc.) are listed. And then there is a thorough description of the history, background and use of the weapon.The pictures alone make this a book to buy. Adding that to the excellent writing and I think this is one of the top ten books every lover of handguns should own."
5,The Importance of Foliage,"It is often the flower that entices us to begin gardening. But as time passes, the experienced gardener begins to ""consider the leaf"". Perhaps it is first in shade gardening, that one realizes the importance and beauty of foliage. Eventually we come to see that a beautiful garden is always made more so by the subtle textures, colors, and shapes of its foliage. Consider The Leaf is a fascinating look at designing with foliage."
2,When did the Canon become the Canon?,"Atwill's thesis is interesting, and in some sense, I think that he is right, namely, that Christianity is an excellent method of control, and this couldn't have been lost on the Romans. In other words, that the Romans used Christianity to control Judea and first, and finally, their empire.Yet Atwill's central assumption is questionable, i.e., that the author of the New Testament is the same person who wrote The War of the Jews. The problem is, the New Testament wasn't the New Testament when the War of the Jews was written. That is, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John weren't the canonical gospels until at least 200 yesrs later.This is Atwill's central assumption, and it doesn't hold water. Again, while I think Atwill is right in seeing Christianity as a means of control, I don't think that his argument can work once you remove this central assumption."
3,Perspective,"One should keep in mind that Mr. Atwill is writing in a twenty-first century 'climate of opinion' about events that took place 2000 years ago. While his interpretation is interesting, people back then did not necessarily think and act as we do today."
1,One of the most confusing books I've ever tried to read,"In this extraordinarily confusing book, Atwill tries to persuade the reader that the Christian Gospels were written under the direction of first-century Roman emperors. His theory is that the Gospels are uncannily similar to the ""War of the Jews"" by Roman historian Josephus. The problem is that to make any sense of this you need to know an awful lot about (a) the Bible (b) the Gospels (c) the history of the Middle East at the time and (d) the work of Josephus. If you don't, you will quickly become lost as Atwill takes two different events from the Gospels and the War of the Jews and then ""shows"" how they are the same event and how this demonstrates the Romans' involvement in the crafting of the Gospels. I gave up at about page 60, my head spinning."
1,Why isn't this listed under fiction??,"If you think the US government caused 9/11 then you might believe this book. This fictional story explains how the Roman emporers created Christianity as a means of control; has Mr. Atwill read the history of the Romans their culture?? Their brutal tactics of slash and conquer were in no way akin to the creation of a complex religion that completely denied their own form of worship. Regardless, this book follows in the footsteps of the Da Vinci Code as another story mixing historical fact (albeit skewed) and creative writing."
4,A Giant Step in the Right Direction,Length:: 5:36 MinsMark's Other Gospel: Rethinking Morton Smith's Controversial Discovery (ESCJ)
4,Time for the Truth,"Mr Atwill has written ground breaking facts regarding the truth of the canonical biblical texts about Jesus and relating to the Roman texts of same era. The fact that Mr. Atwill is an independant scholar NOT tied to any school is telling. Time has come for these truths- overdue. NOW... A few truly brilliant minds freed from the chains of cultural brainwashing just might save our world in a real way in the coming years-find what is truly 'spiritual' and lead us out of the current ecological, and cultural curse that western 'romanized' humanity has brought upon itself.Thanks Joseph!!"
5,Fascinating and I Believe He Is Absolutely Correct,"Jesus never existed. If true, what does that do? It means that the Jewish Messiah is yet to come. I like that. And I really liked Atwill's book, which I read in its first version: ""The Roman Origin of Christianity."" I also met Mr. Atwill at a Book Expo convention. He is a mild and patient man, who has had the misfortune of exposing the Christian fraud. Not something that can be done without tremendous courage.Moreover, the writing style is easy and not overly annotated and filled with scholarly expositions. It can be understood by anybody.Since it is only a theory, albeit a theory with a lot of scientific evidence, it will be interesting to see the attack of the Christians and the Critics."
1,"Interesting, but seriously flawed","I am surprised by all the glowing reviews here. Although it is true that today it is pretty much only fundamentalists who take the gospels as literal history, there's no reason at all to think they were the products of a Roman conspiracy. Don't waste your time on this book. If you want to learn about the origins of Christianity, and the question of the historicity of Jesus Christ, there are far better books available here on Amazon, such asIncredible Shrinking Son of Man: How Reliable Is the Gospel Tradition?orJesus: Neither God Nor Man - The Case for a Mythical Jesus, both of which are excellent. Don't take my word for it - you can read Robert M. Price's review of Atwill's book here: [...] [search for ""Joseph Atwill's, Caesar's Messiah: The Roman Conspiracy to Invent Jesus Ulysses Press, 2005 Reviewed by Robert M. Price"" if link does not work or is removed]."
2,"Good Concept, Poor Execution","I loved using the keyboard for typing and it is very comfortable --- BUT.The letters are painted on non-durably. After a year or so the E and D, evidently most commonly used, wore off. I contacted Microsoft and they were very nice about sending a free replacement keyboard. I assumed they would have fixed the problem. Bad assumption! After another year the same letters wore off again.For an ergonomic keyboard, it has some of the shortcut buttons in a very stupid place; in the middle of the resting pad. Very often the heel of my hand would hit the buttons accidentally, change the settings, and require resetting.The problems are not worth the benefits and, with my new computer, I returned to a conventional keyboard."
3,overpriced by 5,"ok i had this keyboard for 1 year and it stoped working on me, and i take care of my keyboards, im writing this review from the first keyboard i brought, an ibm old style one with no fancdy keys etc and the mycrosoft always felt like a much more cheaper keyboard than this one, the plastic on the keys and casing of the ibm is about 2 times thicker and it still has all the letters on them, on the microsoft the letters started to fade away after 3 weeks! the keyboard started to malfunction after 6 months, the space bar felt like garbage from day one, and 8 keys on the keyboard stopped working after a year so i had to go back to my old and sturdy ibm, no more microsoft hardware for me, oh and by the way i paid 42 dollars for it."
1,Extrememly disatisfied with product and Amazon,"Purchased product based on ""pack of 5"" description. It was not a pack of five, just one (1) OEM box with no software. Could not get them to send me the other four. No help whatsoever"
5,Fabulous Read!,"AN AFFAIR MOST WICKED caught me from Page 1. The romance is hot and steamy! But it's the developing love story that really caught my attention. For once, the level of attraction between the hero and heroine is deeper than just a strong case of lust. It was fun to follow the romance as their mutual attraction slowly turned to love.Another thing I liked about the story was the American heiress heroine. Her very American reactions to Victorian England society made me laugh. Her nationality brought a freshness to the story that wouldn't have been there if she'd been a British heiress. It's a great read!"
3,its ok..,"based on the previous reviews i thought this book would be better then it actually was. the first half of the book was pretty good, but after the got married, the doubts and the mistrust between the two of them just got really annoying. it seemed to be the sterotypical oh you don't trust me kind of scenario."
1,Very disappointing,"This book is a sequel (middle book in a trilogy) to TO MARRY THE DUKE. The first book was entertaining, not great literature, not historically accurate, not populated by well-defined or believable characters--just entertaining. This book is an embarrassment. The hero is a self-pitying, embittered, and arrogant boor with one or two redeeming qualities. The heroine is irritating, impulsive, spoiled, self-centered, and totally lacking in common sense (among other things). The author describes her as charming, refreshing, and witty. The two characters fall in lust-at-first-site (can't imagine why) and the whole book flows from there. It is supposed to be set in Regency England, but could have been set in 21st Century Manhattan without changing the characters (just their wardrobes). There is a possibility, I suppose, that the book got better after page 195. But, by that time, I figured I had punished myself sufficiently for having spent the $6.00."
3,3.5 Stars....,"3.5 Stars...I'm really torn on how to rate this one...but I settled on 3 Stars because there were times when the writing was a little ""off"" and didn't flow smoothly enough for me and Clara just grated on my nerves for the most part; I can't give credit were it isn't due.Now Sir Seger Wolfe, the Marquess of Rawdon is another story (humina humina (sigh)).!.! What a man he was! Maclean did such a wonderful job bringing this true to life sexy man alive. I was lost in the sea green of his eyes and the cute dimple in his chin... This may be a little shallow but I do love, love, love when the man on the cover actually matches the hero in the book (J.R Ward did a great job with that too with ""Lover Avenged"")."
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to Clara's story. I enjoyed to Marry a Duke very much. but not so with this book.Clara doesn't trust her husband as far as she can throw him, but demands he trust her blindly. She acts very childish and makes no real attempt to see what is really going on with her husband. Seger had some bad turns but he is honest with Clara and the same cannot be said for her. I thought when they started writing letters that perhaps we were going to get some character development. All it ended up to be was a race to the bedding.Seger ends up being the bad guy and he really does nothing wrong. Shock plays a big part in his reaction but does Clara stay and find out what is happening? No - she runs away like a spoiled child because she assumes she has been betrayed. Sometimes you wonder if she actually likes her husband with how she treats him.I was really hoping for better. Sophia's story was wonderful and it did not carry over to this book."
3,Christian Thrash,"This album is better than the last one, though it still doesn't quite gel totally. Between the first album and this one this group got a new guitar player and drummer, and that did seem to improve things a bit. The vocals are of the hardcore style (with one song having a guest vocalist that sounds sort of like Lajon Witherspoon of Sevendust). The lyrics again range from weak to condescending, though again try to tackle issues that are important to Christians. The first song is by far the best, with some catchy guitar work, and the next four aren't too bad either. But after that it goes downhill with what seems largely like filler material. It's a 45 minute CD that feels like it's an hour long. I'd recommend this album to people who were interested in Christian thrash."
5,worth it for regarding steven alone,"the 3rd track, regarding steven, is such an amazing song. my favorite of all blues traveler songs. this song is not on four. worth buying for that song alone!!!"
3,Getting the Joke: The inner workings of Stand-up Comedy,I enjoyed this book. It is well written and very readable. Double is a little more cerebral than the average comedian and certainly more academic. The topic is a little bit misleading. If you are interested in the history of stand-up this book is for you. If you like a panoply of insights and interviews on famous stand-ups you will probably enjoy this book. I am confident that Double has a lot to offer his students and has decent curriculum that will service a student through the comedy process. This book is not the curriculum that the title implies. It is more like a showcase from which conclusions and instruction are vague at best. The insights are not all useful but the research is comprehensive. I recommend the book but not as a tutorial.
4,"likes worms,too",I enjoyed the style of writing here. Many ideas could be used in any town that was brave enough to follow through for the betterment of Mother Earth and the those living with her. Mary Appelhof's business is still going.
4,The Chicago Conspiracy Trial,Great historical trial. You will find that the same is going on now 40 years later with the current administration.
5,Abba Arrival Deluxe Edition is an excellent set for fans!,"The Polar deluxe edition of Abba's 1976 breakthrough album Arrival is a real treat for fans. The booklet has extensive notes on both the CD and DVD. The DVD is more than 90 minutes, the highlight being an old tv special called Abba Dabba Doo. The recording session is also very interesting. Arrival was Abba's biggest album in the US at the time, and includes classics When I Kissed The Teacher, Dancing Queen, Knowing Me Knowing You, Money Money Money, Tiger, the awesome instrumental title track, and bonus track Fernando. If you need a copy of Arrival, I highly recommend the deleuxe edition. One of the top-three Abba albums and required for any fan of the band."
5,really nice model,"you are looking for a anime doll for the desktop of your work/room?? ... Dont look anymore ... this is the perfect model you need to buy ... pretty, nice and it is not too ""dirty"" (in case you dont want your girlfriend begin to say things about the doll)"
4,Low sounds for open ears.,"Multi-instrumentalist Vinny Golia has long been the West Coast avant garde's scene patriarch. Running his own label allows him to document projects of a conceptually limited scope that other labels might shy away from. An entire album of solo contrabass saxophone improvisations might sound tediously homogenous if it weren't for the fact that Golia is such a stellar reed player. Being the lynchpin of an entire scene has allowed Golia to enlist the cream of the crop of West Coast avant gardists to join him in exploring the myriad possibilities of this instrument. From chamberesque meditations to bluesy shuffles and angular boppish lines, there are no stylistic stones left unturned here. Small string sections, trombones, an upright bass and even a synth occasionally add to the mix, bolstering the big horn's range. For those with an ear for the tonally adventurous, this disc is nothing short of fascinating."
4,There's a new Tom in town and its not Peters.,This book is definately a hidden gem for business owners large and small. Tom gets right to the point bypassing the marketing babble to give us his clear take on today's most powerful concept in business. One of the few marketing books out there which the author lays it all on the table and shares all his valuable and insightful marketing advice with his readers. It sure is refreshing to finally read a book on marketing with out all the fluff and BS. Check out Tom's blog as well. You'll be glad you did. Good stuff.
5,"Impactful, Clear, Quick, To-the-point","This book was great for me because it is structured as a conversation with two speakers making points and counterpoints- the book was like a conversation that might occur right in one of my company's meeting rooms, and for that reason I found it riveting, enjoyable-to-read, and applicable to real life business!"
5,This thing is neater than sliced bread!,"I don't know what everyone else is talking about, mine has fit beautifully in Wal-Mart, Target, and Publix shopping carts. This thing is amazing!!!! Maybe the company started making it bigger, but mine has fit every store cart I've put it into.I love the fact that it's so easy to use, you just plop it in the basket and it unfolds over the seat, you put your child in there and then you've got 2 free hands. All you do is snap him/her in and wrap the fabric over the cart handle (velcro) and you're done! I've read the reviews on every one of these stupid things Amazon has and some of them require ties and all sorts of junk. This can easily be done one-handed! Highly recommended!"
5,I Love This Product!,"My baby is 8 months old. I reviewed all the shopping cart covers online before purchasiing one. This was my choice for 2 reasons. First, the cushions on the sides of the baby. Second, a review stated it's made in the USA. This cover is beautiful! It has fit every cart that I've put it in; Walmart, Winn Dixie, & even Good Will. The material is nice. The color & texture is nice. It's great that her teethers & toys don't hit the floor. As far as being able to put it in with one hand goes I haven't had to do that. I bring the cart to my vehicle & put the cover in it there instead of trying to hold a baby while getting the cart ready. She goes from carseat to cart. I highly recommend this shopping cart cover. I am 100% satisified with this purchase!"
5,Great cover for keeping baby comfy while shopping!!,"This is a great shopping cart cover. I purchased it after trying one of those loose ones that cover the cart. My 7 month old frequently falls asleep in the cart, and while our old one covered the cart to protect him from germs, it did nothing to cushion his sweet head from the hard metal. This one is so easy to put in the cart, and has fit all of the carts I've tried so far. It helps my little one stay upright, and has nice soft pillows for when he decides to doze off. It also has straps for toys and pockets for storage (great for tucking in my coupon holder and keys!). It was definitely worth the money and I am so happy I bought it. It also works great in restaurant highchairs too!"
3,needs more padding,"The side pads are great but the back and actual seat are too thin to provide proper support or comfort for a baby. I double this up with another pad, and only then, it works well enough."
3,"Like it at stores, hoped it would work in highchairs","I really like this product. I find it easy to use. I can put it on the cart with one hand with no problem. Its great for my 7 month hold. She was getting TOO big for the carrier but I didn't want to put her right in the shopping carts. It fits carts every place I've been- Target, the grocery store, I think Home Depot.My only complaint is that it does not fit on high chairs when we go out to eat. She is still a bit too small for most high chairs so i was hoping this would help but it doesn't work. So if you want one for both purposes, do not get this one. But if you just want it for the stores- great product."
3,Good but Hard to Fold back up...,This is nice if your baby is first learning to sit up. My guy is 8 months old and it works nicely. I don't like the fact that it is hard to fold back up and even when its folded its rather large so it takes a lot of space in the back seat. I also am not a fan of the fact it has velcro all the way across the handle part. It makes it hard to undo.
2,Not the color and pattern descibed,"Didn't like the pattern and was expecting the Sage Pin Dot pattern as described, however when I received this, it is blue. Had to pay for shipping again to return the item."
5,"The Legendary JB and the Incomparable Maceo Parker, It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This","Best James Brown CD that I've heard, extended recordings of everything, which gives his legendary band (featuring the incomparable Maceo Parker and Clyde Stubblefield) a chance to shine."
5,"REST IN PEACE, JB!!!!","THE MAN!!!!! hell, to me, he died too soon. this collection right here is ESSENTIAL!!!! nuff said, it's DA GODFATHA NOW!!!!! rest in peace, soul brotha!!!!"
4,"Good but some filler songs, too","I was around during this time period, and saw James Brown live because he was my mother's favorite live performer. I was surprised, however, at the number of filler songs in this collection. Some remastering would have been nice, too. Standout songs that held up for me were ""Out of Sight,"" ""Money Won't Change You,"" ""Cold Sweat,"" and ""I Don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing."" Even though the instrumentals on ""Say It Loud"" sound a little stark now, I remember how I felt when I heard the song over the radio back then. It was a bold message and messenger, truly uplifting for its time."
3,"Not bad, but there are much better options","I bought this book a while ago, but recently got my hands on Richard Williams' ""The Animator's Survival Kit"" and it is astonishingly stronger in every way. I just bought that one tonight actually. Skip this one and go straight to Williams' book, it is strong for beginners, and even stronger for people like myself who need something more detailed and insightful than ""The Animator's Workbook."" I didn't know there was more that I could learn about the basics and subtleties for a great foundation until I read ""Survival Kit."" Please learn from my mistake and do yourself a favor by buying that one. You'll be way ahead of the curve."
4,Happy,"I've been happy with this book! It breaks down animation techniques in an understandable way, and I like following along with the exercises. Although I've studied some animation before, it covers some things that I've never thought about before, like how our heads turn on arcs and such."
4,wow,"I am impressed. I didn't expect this book to be so detailed. My son is just getting interested in animation and I got this for him for xmas, I am sure he will love it! My hubby, who is a pro, has voiced an interest in his own copy."
2,What was that?,"I felt my money was wasted on this. I have studied French Impressionism only a little. I am not and expert, but this was a dissapointment. If you are anywhere along the line of study here, buy something else. There were too many gossipy tid bits about long passed people. I did not care for what I felt was the over ripe commentary, and the reproductions were easily surpassed by other releases. You are on your own here."
3,"Maybe ""Contemporary German Theologies"" plus PC","Unfortunately, this may not be the book you were really looking for. The authors were apparently students of the most recent German theology included in the book, and really decided to write a series of essays on earlier 20th Century German Theologies which lead up to their favorite professor. In order to claim their title for the tome, they throw in four more politically correct essays as an afterthought. Essentially, the book expounds on Dead White European Male (DWEM) thinking of the German Lutheran tradition. The problem is that you may have a hard time telling where the original theologian was standing from where the authors claim he was standing. In my view, all the necessary thinking of contempary German theologians is still available in the original source books. Rather than read about the beliefs of Barth, Bultmann and Bonhoeffer, according to Miller and Grenz, just get the books by Barth, Bultmann and Bonhoeffer and make up your own mind."
4,Great inexpensive putting mat,I was about to try more expensive mat from another brand. But gave a try this mat.I prefer battery-less mat with auto return feature and steep angle at the end.This mat met both preference of mine.The ball is returning without problem if you make or miss the hole.I'm not sure about the green quality since I didn't try other brand yet.Hope I can improve my putting with this mat.
4,I think it was worth the money.,It does what it is suppost to do. My 19 year old son like it. One small problem the balls don't return all the way back.
4,Simple but effective,"I bought this for my dad as part of his Christmas gifts. It's a cheap, simple alternative to the automated systems out there. My dad enjoys practicing on it. It's cheap felt and plastic but does everything you expect it to. I recommend it if you don't feel like shelling out more money for a mechanical putting system."
4,1996 U.S. championships,"This video is nothing more than the women's all-around final from the 1996 u.s. national championships. The video is one hour in length, and does have highlights from the men's competition, but that's it. There is no gymnasts from other countries, just the women's final from the '96 u.s. championships. Gymnasts include: D. Dawes, S. Miller, D. Moceanu, J. Phellps, A. Bordon, and some others. Mary Lou Retton is NOT in this video, in case you were wondering."
2,works 1/2 way,"this game is fun at first, but a few hours into it, it crashes, and even with the patch that was supposed to fix that problem it started crashing sooner and sooner. lost most of my game and finally quit due to frustration."
5,R.P.G. As it should be,"Pool Of Radiance is a perfect Role Playing Game. The users that have problems with it (and like games like Baulders Gate) are click festers. They do not want to think about what to do they just want to click and go. Role Playing games are meant to be turn based so that you can accurately control your party. In real life, and I have been in real life combat, a team does not just rush in and hack away. Each person makes decisions based on what they are confronted with and what the rest of the team is doing. If you just hack away you end up dead. I love to play the dice version of D&D and this is the closest thing I have ever seen to it on a computer. Temple of Elemental Evil is ok. but compared to the graphics of Pool it sucks as well."
1,Horrible...do not waste any money on this,"I unfortunately bit and spent the 6 bucks on this, and if I had my way, I would send it back to get it. If you have played Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale, take my word for it and stay away."
5,Change The Way You Communicate With Your Child,"""What Did I Just Say! "" by Denis Donovan, M.D. and Deborah McIntyre, M.A., R.N. is a book on how to communicate effectively with your children. This is a must in this day of computer wiz kids. It gives you phrases and practical statements to say to your children to help them process what you really want them to do. Children don't always hear what we meant. This book will change the way you communicate and interact with your children. Pick this one up today and be on your way to a better, more insightful relationship with your kids."
3,Fun but predictable,"The was a fun story about poor girl meeting rich man, who is disguise as the gardener. The only complaints I have are that the fact that he was 'just a gardener', the overriding sense of snobbishness on the part of Catherine became really annoying. And anyone who is a fan of Jane Austen or Georgette Heyer would not tolerate the kisses and sexual innuendo. How I wish that Ms Hern would leave it out; it's not necessary and is not true to the genre."
5,Sweet story!,"All I can say is that my family kept asking why I was laughing! The antics of Mr. Archibald cracked me up, and the conspiracy. Once again the choice was whether the lady would marry for love or money. I was pleased with the ending. Great read!"
5,Another 5 Star,I am so addicted to romance books especially when there is a Duke involved. Ms. Hern has done it again. Such an amazing read. It is a wonderful book to curl up with anytime.
3,Amusing but unsatisfactory,"Many scenes in this book were quite amusing. However it was ultimately unsatisfying -- over the course of the book the hero demands that the heroine choose love over financial security, but the hero is not asked to make any sacrifice for their relationship. He essentially behaves childishly throughout the book while she has to struggle with much more responsible/life defining choices. Yet he is (of course) rewarded with ""his heart's desire"" at the end."
3,A nice read but comes undone at the end,I quite enjoyed this book. I love the Regency Period but get frustrated at too many inaccuracies in Regency romances. For most of this story I found it very satisfying. One knows what to expect from romances and while this book followed the formula it was well written with engaging characters. Of a lesser book I could have been more forgiving but my expectations were a little bit higher so I was unsatisfied at the end. I will continue to read books by this author though.
2,Not quite as bad...,"While not quite as bad as watching paint dry, the only thing that kept it from that was that I was exasperated enough and wincing enough to stay awake.Impoverished sisters visit a dowager duchess' house party. The heroine's sister is the usual amiable beauty who the heroine hopes will marry a wealth man. The older sister meanwhile spends time with the gardener. The gardener, of course, is the duke, and being a charming sort of fellow, he sets out to test her. Will she marry a poor gardener (her family truly needs money) or will she refuse him?The writing was rather bad and the plot questionable, but the characters were cardboard cutouts of the most boring sort. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,For silent film lovers,"Mr. George's review is excellent and comprehensive. The pace of The Coward is a little slower and the acting more stagey than in the shorter films, but I thoroughly enjoyed all three of these films and found them interesting, with well-filmed battle sequences for the period. Charles Ray, who plays the title role in The Coward, had a long silent film career. To appreciate the range of his roles, try The Busher (included in the Kino DVD ""Reel Baseball"") and The Garden of Eden, one of the best comedies of the silent era."
4,Nice,When we purchased our home these handles were installed. We added French doors to our study and needed this set. We searched every where and found them on Amazon. These are different and classy.
4,I like it,Go through these tapes fast!Nice to have 6 tapes at this good price.Good quality.They work well for my home movie purposes.
5,great buy,I purchase these video casetes because it is very hard to find them in the stores. When youdo they each retail for about $5 compared to under $2 and the quality is pretty good.
5,Cheap and effective,"Cheap, quality tapes, work well with my Canon HV30. I try to stick to a single brand so I don't have to use a head cleaner (not all that important, anyway. I've been using this brand of tapes for 2 years now without an issue."
3,It has its moments,"I wasn't as wowed by this CD as I was hoping to. It starts out strong with a few good tracks, but then the following tracks seem to lose the spark I was hoping to see. Preview snippets or samples of this before buying to see if it's a match for you."
5,BEST HOUSE ALBUM OF 2005!,"This must be the best House album of the year! For those who aren't DJ's and previously could not get their hands on the singles put on vinyl, this is an awesome CD you NEED to get into your collection. Though the only downside to this CD is that they are radio edits and not the full vinyl mixes. The new tracks ""Feels So Good"" and ""Time For Love"" are incredible tracks! ""Feels So Good"" originally appeared on Bad Boy Bill's Behind The Decks (CD+DVD) and was not released as a single until now. Both the funky, more laid back original and the hard Disco-House remix are top-notch and a much-have. ""Time For Love"" takes on the European Peak-Hour House taste similar to that of Eric Prydz and Steve Angello. A bit different then what we're used to from JJ Flores & Steve Smooth, but they pulled it off quite nicely. This CD is SERIOUSLY worth every tiny bit of pennies you spend on it, and for DJ's: GET THE VINYL VERSION AT DANCERECORDS.COM! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
4,Beautiful !,This is a very beautiful bowl. Great for displaying on table. Too bad it contains lead...the lead actually is the reason why this bowl sparkles so much. I won't put anything edible in this bowl especially acidic foods otherwise it is a great centerpiece.
4,Great Little EP,"Its a shame the Gin Blossoms broke up. I think their fans would have really appreciated a b-sides and rarity package from them. Idiot Summer and Seeing Stars are excellent songs. The latter fits in nicely with their hit singles, Hey Jealousy and Found Out About You."
2,Fair product & Bad shipping,"Like most of people, I chose this item based on other's review.I used this only once so far, in dry way.Before telling anything about how it works, it's extremly noisy.I don't think even my boyfriend's shaver makes such a big noise.It removes hairs in wide areas like thighs, but not that great when it comes to narrower areas like around ankle.And I am the only one who noticed rubber burning like smell?I think I will try it in wet way next time.Or I might discover how to use it 100% like some of the rivewiers did.But the shipping was too bad. I placed order on 3rd, but it didn't arrive till 23rd. Then the box was dented big time, as well as the hard plastic wrapping. Also the surface of the shaver cover was dirty too.Hope I can enjoy the shaver like others do soon."
3,why are women's shavers still ages behind men's?,"As with the case of many regular razors, the male model always hits the shelves first; once the female version comes around it's often the same product in pink with an aloe strip, or in some cases far inferior. Such is the same of many women's electric shavers. From what I can tell, most lack the power and sharpness their male counterparts have. I bought this shaver a few months ago from drugstore.com for $34.99, and have been much disappointed.Pros: Decent price. It holds a charge for a respectable period of time, and works in the shower or tub.Cons: It's very slow with its less-than-sharp blades! You have to go over an area many times to get it right, although doing so doesn't result in any ill effects other than lost time. Its size is also not suited for the bikini area.All in all, as it was my first electric shaver, perhaps my expectations were too high. I'll stick to borrowing my boyfriend's electric razor when he's not looking."
5,Convenient and non-irritating,"After reading the reviews i bought this shaver from a local Target, and I love it! i was looking for a less irritating way to shave my bikini area, because i always got terrible razor burn from using regular razors, and this shaver works great. it doesn't shave as close, of course, but that is why it's less irritating. and your legs will still LOOK nice and smooth, even if they dont FEEL quite as smooth. to get the closest shave, shave slowly, and use the bikini extension when needed. i hadn't even planned on using it on my legs but i do all the time now just because it is so convenient. if i am going out somewhere but neglected to shave in the shower that morning, i can just pick up my shaver and shave my legs dry with no hassle and no irritation, and they will look great. i even shaved my legs in my boyfriend's car on the way to church last sunday! i recommend this product. you can use it anytime- it's fast, convenient and gentle."
3,Fantasía adolescente bien escrita,"Se trata de una novela inmadura pero increíblemente bien escrita, una historia esquizofrénica. Cursi, naf, a veces risible, pero rabiosamente poética y con una prosa muy bella. El resultado es similar al que lograría una doceañera educada con ""Esther y su mundo"" que tuviera un talento prodigioso para escribir. En resumen, una fantasía preadolescente tan bien escrita que asusta."
4,Odio y silencio.,"No he leído ""Irlanda"", pero sí ""Donde siempre es octubre"". Espido Freire ofrece sus cuentos como obleas profranas, como pequeñas e insípidas hostias de una comunión con el tiempo. Su literatura es la tarea sacerdotal de una monja que destila en el silencio de su convento, donde nada visible ocurre, odio y dolor apretados. Me recuerda a algunos poemas de Rilke en ""Nuevos Poemas"" (¿La encajera?) Como encajes, donde desaparecen sutilmente las vidas de quienes los tejieron, son los cuentos de Espido Freire. Más de una lectura mejora la mayoría de ellos. Como escribe Octavio Paz, ""nacen del silencio, se abren sobre tallos de silencio, las costemplamos en silencio"". He recordado, desde mi primera lectura, ""Voces"", una pieza de solidez irrecusable. Y hace poco releí, con un estremecimiento que merecía ser iniciático, ""Ayram"". Lo dice un donostiarra."
3,Good Introductory Text,The author does a good job of introducing basic econometrics with a touch of theory and some applications. OLS and basic regression tests are well covered and various other topics are covered on the surface. I'd say one needs only a little math or statistical background to read and understand the book since several chapters are dedicated to explaining these necessary concepts.I'd say the text is at about the 2-3rd year level of an undergrad program.
2,Horrible textbook...,"I'm an econ major and I'm taking Applied Econometrics this semester. My professor thinks that this book is great for his class, but that tells me one of two things: 1. there is a severe lack of ""good"" textbooks for applied econometrics classes, or 2. he hasn't done his homework. The worst part about this book is that there are no examples. It is mostly straight theory. The three or four examples I found in the book are long and detailed and are not of help when doing a problem set for class. I hope someone writes a better textbook because, as a struggling econ major, this book definitely did not make my learning experience any easier."
1,Unsatisfactory,"I had the unpleasant experience of using this book in a class taught by the author at UNC School of Law. I found the book to be disappointing as law school texts go. There is NO scholarly material or note material. This book is nothing but cases and the notes are just questions. What notes there are contain no discussion or references to other cases and articles. Personally, thorough note material is my favorite part of case books. A close second is the essays often included. A book of nothing but cases is not one I would choose to keep on my shelf (I sold it back to my school store for a miserable nine dollars, which this book is not even worth in my opinion). Don't buy this unless your professor is forcing you to!"
3,Almost embarassing,"I am almost embarassed to say that I enjoyed this book. Some of the main subjects being discussed are merely an end of the year dance and a popularity poll that will be announced there and the main character (Sammy) feeling bad that she killed a bird and didn't tell anyone. The other main line that the plot follows is about the town wanting to tear down a block of buildings and the mystery that arises from this. The mysteries are always intriguing and what pulls this book through is that Sammy is a spunky, willful, and curious heroine who narates the entire book with an entertaining dialogue and outlook on the different situations. It was fun to read a Sammy Keyes novel and in the end there was a good message sent about believing in your voice. This is a good contemporary read as long as you are only looking for a book to enjoy."
3,incomplete,half of the sentences on page 5 of the story are missing. I returned the book once because I thought it was a misprint but the 2nd book I received was the same. I didn't want to return a 2nd time because I figured it would come to me the same way. Otherwise great service from amazon.
4,brings me closer to home,"My father, Don ""Pete"" Colyer, was one of the main characters in the book, and his enthusiasm for this book is addicting. After my reading, I learned a lot about my father's history/past that I was totally unaware of. It makes me feel much closer to him and I feel that I know him a little bit more."
1,Not too good to miss ......,"The previous album ""Well Done"" was a nice laid-back instrumental album which got significant airplay with tracks like ""Europa"". Then he made this rubbish. What was he thinking? The brainless Europa chillout remix here is typical. The notes say ""It's cool, sophisticated ..."". I rest my case."
5,Great Product,"I ordered this item for my Canon S5IS so I would be able to use camera Filters, Polarizer, Neutral Density etc. I ordered the Digital Concepts lens adapter, but the one I got was stamped with the Opteka brand. I have no complaints with the Opteka that I received, it is made of aluminum and very sturdy. It attaches to my S5 very snugly and it makes using filters a breeze."
5,Works great on S5 IS,"The adapter I received doesn't look anything like the picture, but it works just fine on an S5 IS. No rattle, locks up tight, and works with the Canon 58 mm haze filter just fine. Plenty of room under the adapter to zoom the lens; no interferrence anywhere. Black color matches the camera body; looks like a factory part, but much more durable due to aluminum construction. Cameta Camera had it to me in a couple of days, not bad since it came to the Left Coast from back east."
5,It works,I bought this lens adapter for my Canon S2 IS and am quite happy with it. It works and my filters don't get stuck threaded onto it like they do on the more expensive metal Canon version which I bought first.
5,They got it right after two tries,"The first shipment of this adapter was silver, made for S2 IS. After two calls back to the company, they finally sent the black model, as originally ordered. This adapter fits nice and tight, and works great with the haze filter and 58 mm Canon lens cap. Highly recommend this for S5 users."
3,"Not bad, but not the best","Its sturdy, and quite solid, my only complain is that for some reason it sometimes didn't quite fit on my Powershot S3IS so it failed to lock, therefore the lens attached felt loose, the problem seemed to be excess material from the factory cut on the side for the camera, I sandpaper it an locked just fine and no complaints from then on..."
1,Better title is talentless garbage 2!,First of all these songs are not by the original artists! These tracks are re-created by wannabe dj's and singers that can't um sing.It's bad enough there was a vol.1 and now this? What a waste.Save your money and look elsewhere please.
5,Some of Sting's best work is on singles,"If you're not into Sting's singles, you're missing out on some of his best work. These outtakes from Mercury Falling might have been left out of the album because of their ""uncommercial"" appeal, but they are great songs. I'm hopping for a day when a box set of somekind is released with all of the ""b sides"", side-work, collaborations, soundtrack projects etc. Worth searching for this and more singles like it."
3,Just ok...,"The Pirates Bride is a beautiful tune, the only track I listen to on this disc. I'm a big time Sting fan and I'm just calling it as I hear it."
3,a helpful guide,"this was my first book, mainly because i didn't know what i was looking for and it had ""the craft"" written on the cover! i'm still a beginner, but having seen some other books on the subject, i realise this book is really just a guide line on how to cast circle and what the celebrations are and when. i did find the chapter on tools interesting, but there is nothing really on spells or much history, and i ended up with more questions than answers. i think it's good as a companion guide and is quite easy to read, but if you're looking for something more indepth, look elsewhere."
2,there are better books.....,"Unlike Ravenwolf's work, you won't have to unlearn what morrison teaches you, but this book is ok, not good, not great, and needs to be part of a library of much more to be coherant. The compainion book to it is useless."
4,VERY SATISFIED,"I would order from this seller again because I am very satisfied at the speed in which my order came. The book was in good condition, as stated in description."
3,This book was intertaining,I enjoyed reading this book. It is a very good book for people interested in the craft or just beginning.
5,very well organized,The book was everything that I wanted and the shipment came efficiently. I was very pleased with my package.
3,Not quite a book of shadows,"This is a good book, but the title is a bit misleading. The ""Companion"" is more of a book of shadows.In any case, good book, good explainations. Might be a tad bit complicated in some area for the novice, but if you really are interested in learning more about The Craft and Wicca, you will persevere in the more ""cloudy"" area and found this book to be a good tool. But if you are a novice, this book won't be much help without the ""Companion"" once you've understood and mastered the use of your Craft tools."
4,JUst starting,"i just started to learn about magic and wicca,and this book is a very good teacher.It even tells you what words mean at the bottom of each page.If your just starting this is the book to read first"
2,Fluff Wicca,"This book is mostly for those who fall into the ""fluff-bunny"" sweetness and light camp of Wicca. It is very well written, and also good introduction if that is how you think. But if you want something more balanced, then look eleswhere."
2,THE CRAFT - D. MORRISON,"I HAVE THIS BOOK AND AM QUITE DISAPPOINTED WITH IT.IF YOU ARE AN AVID READER ABOUT THE CRAFT/WICCA, I THINK YOU WILL FIND IT IS FOR THE NOVICE. SAME OLD, SAME OLD..."
5,Best Book Ever!!!,"This book offers ALL the info. And it is such a good book I would recommend it to ANYONE!!! Please, this is a must read! I rate it 5 stars. There is so much information of all the herb properties and uses. As with stones. It offers all of the ritual need info, as well as the entire casting circle process. It has so much of the history, coming out of the closet and the history! This book will amaze you. Please buy!"
5,This book has everything!,"Spells, The Book of Shadows, and other things to know about Wiccan is all here in this book! I am proud to be Wiccan, and I love this book!"
3,Great for exercises - loose the dogma,"I'm really glad I found this book. It's great for exercising your personal energy and learning how to use your tools. I've used it lots. BUT it is covered with my scribbling in the margins things like ""Why?"" ""That makes no sense!"" and ""She's nuts!"" She does an... interesting job of bringing the Old Testament to Wicca, which is the exact opposite of what the Craft is supposed to be. Make sure your offerings don't offend the gods? If the athame draws so much as a drop of blood it must be destroyed beyond repair? Let those who would love AND bear children be handfasted?This book is great for the exercises, but throw the dogma out on the curb.Also, her philosophy seems to be ""To bind the spell every time, let the spell be spake in... really, really pathetic attempts at rhyme."" I know that doesn't affect the quality of the book, but sheesh, lady! Sup does NOT rhyme with love!"
4,Good and basic,"This is a fantastic book for a beginner. Full stop.It gives a little insight to the craft while making it fun at the same time. This book isn't MEANT to be technical or a history into wicca, it's just simple, straight to the point material which is what initial training into wicca should be. If you buy it expecting it to give you more then you will be disappointedA few of the reviews complain about the spells and rituals being in rhyme but they need to be for beginners so they can complete spells successfully before beginning to learn energy raising, lifting the power of a spell etcI started my path with this book and it was good until I became hungry for more knowledge which is when I gave it to a friend interested in the craft herself"
1,XML,I was very disappointed with this purchase. I notified the seller and he never responded to my email.
4,Thank You!,"Product was in good condition and just what I ordered, although the packaging was very bad."
5,I see we are all in agreement here!,"As I write this review I see we are all in agreement here by giving the movie ""Moving"" by Richard Pryor 5 STARS! I loved this movie. I always thought it was so underated. It baffled me as to why it wasnt released on DVD a lot sooner. I have'nt seen greased lightning but Im sure it will be good too."
4,Great Commedy I rate PG 16,"I have been searching for this Richard Pryor movie ""Moving"" for sometime. I could not seem to find this move without another movie as a set. There are some areas in the movie that are not really appropriate for younger children (i.e., cursing, and certain scenes promoting violence). This is a family movie but I strongly suggest that you use discernment and hide this away from children under age 16. Enjoy."
4,Stylin' Like a Pro,"I have always used the Conair Yellow Bird and been happy with it. However, the last one I had did not last as long as the previous one. I have always had good luck with Conair and decided to upgrade. It does a great job, cuts down on drying time and my hair does not seem as dried out. I have used both a diffuser and the regular attachment and both work equally well. Would recommend, but it is a heavier hair dryer."
4,A man's hair dryer,This dryer is very powerful and well built. I believe women may not like it because of the weight. Very heavy. That is why I gave it 4 stars.
2,A required read,"Working on my Master's in Nursing, I have had to read many textbooks (egahds). This book was worse than most. Very dry and not too applicable in today's world. The writters need to enter the workforce and see the struggles that nurse managers face and offer concise advice that can be used in practice, not just theory. A review won't help as the book for many will be required for class, but you may want to see if your library can loan it out, and check with your school library as they can borrow it from other facilities throughout the U.S. and may save you the money."
2,A reasonable beginner text,"If you tried Nancy Lynch's ""Distributed Algorithms"" and only care about web apps, this might be the book for you. It's readable, useful for people developing web back ends, and up to date. However, it doesn't try to cover the complexities of general fault-tolerant distributed systems. Besides Lynch's classic text, I recommend Gray and Reuter's ""Transaction Processing,"" a seminal text that should give you a clear idea of how to compose arbitrarily reliable systems out of unreliable components."
4,an intersting read,"I felt that I learned a lot from this book. My problem with books like this is that they are textbooks and meant to help students of psychology or counseling. While this book is strong on the theoretical concepts of family therapy, it is not strong on practicality. Thus, this book is interesting, but not as helpful as it potentially could have been."
2,Review,"This book was put together in very poor quality. The writing in the inside of the back and front cover are upside down, so I have to flip the book to read whats on the inside of the covers. The pages are loosely attached in the middle of the book, making it look as if the book is about to fall apart. I am very disappointed in its quality. I purchased this book brand new, and if it was not for the fact that I needed the book for school and didnt have time to return it, I would have. I purchase from Amazon all the time, eventhough usually from sellers not directly from Amazon, this may have been the first time, and I was not very impressed."
2,Difficult to follow,I am currently using this book as a MSW student. I find this book very difficult to follow and difficult to understand. I am also a family therapist who uses structural family therapy. The chapter in this bok confused me more than it helped me.
1,Too difficult for a intro class,I am using this book for a Marriage and Family Therapy class. I found this book to be too difficult to understand and it took several readings to fully comprehend what they were trying to get across. Good concepts on Bowen but I would not recommend schools use this for an intro course. Its extremely frustrating.
2,overly analytical,"As many have written, this text was extremely difficult to follow and its discussion on cybernetics was not especially relevant to the field. As a practicing therapist, this text did little to improve my understanding and did much to muddy the waters."
1,Yuck.,"It's not that this book is too difficult, it's just poorly written. The Nichols/Schwartz book is much better. This book was assigned for MFT Theory class, and I ended up throwing it away (literally) and getting the Nichols/Schwartz book. I probably read 150 books on my way to getting an MFT education, and this was the worst book in the entire curriculum. Sad that there are so few survey texts available on MFT theory."
5,Great introductory book!,Great introductory book to the theme of family therapy and its systems... could be used in many different approaches in modern therapies.
5,Extremely Helpful,I have used this helpful book since I was in my teens. My mother had it. That was back in 1973. I just got it on my Kindle & am using it daily. I am finding it extremely accurate. Thanks for creating a Kindle version! I'm carrying it in my android phone.
3,"Informative, but not entertaining","I bought this DVD in the hopes of using it as a resource while we studied Pop Art. While it does give the viewer insight into Lichtenstein's process, it is boring. I hate to say that, as I am an artist and art teacher and I love learning more about artists and their work, but it is dry. I was also quite disappointed in how little information was given about Lichtenstein as a person and how his life has influenced his art. If you are an art teacher looking for something to stir the passion and creativity of your students, look elsewhere."
1,IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!,"THIS VIDEO WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE, HEAR, and UNDERSTAND. THERE WERE EXTRANEOUS NOISES THROUGHOUT AND THE VIDEO WAS soooo FLAWED THAT I SUFFERED AN EXTREME HEADACHE WHILE ATTEMPTING TO WATCH IT. This product was advertised to be in good condition. Who had the nerve to so identify such a product? In the past, I have always been more than satisfied with items purchased from Amazon Books. WHAT HAPPENED THIS TIME?Ruth W. Miller"
4,very cool & calm....,A perfect integration of the vibes and guitar resulting in a delicate and beatiful musical string that cativates you and transport together.....
5,Great gift,"My father is an aviation nut, so the video made a great gift. Process of ordering the item and the customer service were sensational!"
2,Just ok,"If you are going to follow an aircraft around the world, the least you could do is use a tripod when you film it and also use professional recording equipment instead of a cheap noise reduction filter that results in a pinging sound through some parts of the audio. Amateur job."
3,very old book.,"It's a short read and will have a good deal to offer someone who doesn't know much about drawing. However if you are an experience artist, it has little to offer other than a few exercises. Nothing too new to me."
3,Good book ruined by poor editing.,"""Hitchhiker's Guide to the _Universe_""?"" ... because 31 in octal is 25 in decimal."" instead of "" ... because OCT 31 == DEC 25""?Plenty of typos, misspellings and typesetting errors too. Overall a decent read if you can get over this, but one can't help but wonder, if Lohr pays this little attention to his own craft (writing), how accurate can his statements about the software world be?If he's cleaned up these ""bugs"" for the second edition, and my suspicions about carelessness in other areas are unfounded, then it gets four stars."
3,looks nice,"This looks nice on my little girls bed, but it is not soft and i think that for the price regular bedding fits just as good.... first time i bought ""DAYBED"" set and i am think for the money it could be softer and come with some sheets....."
2,Wasnt as well written as the first one!,Just didnt flow...not sure if it was the format...but felt really out of sync the whole time! Not sure if it was because it was my first kindle book
2,Very Confusing!,"I loved The Dragon Queen, but this book has really confused me, there are so many different people with all different adventures that it gets really muddled up. Sometimes, I don't even know how the character got to a certain place and I thought I had missed something, so I go back and check, but still if confuses me. Some of the things like the ""War Song"" I have no idea what it is.... maybe more decription in parts of the story and less in others? That may help!"
2,The Raven Warrior,"I found The Dragon Queen at my local library and enjoyed reading it very much. I then picked up The Raven Warrior and although I made it through the book, I was disappointed in the modern dialogue that permeated the book. I will probably read the third book when it comes out, but hope she focuses on the action rather than the attempts to be witty, which are totally inappropriate for this genre of book."
3,"Disjointed, awkward transitions","I have just read both of the Gwynhwyfar books and am very pleased with the departure from traditional roles for the characters. I did greatly enjoy reading them both and will anxiously await the next one in the trilogy. However, I do agree with a couple of reviews I had read that cite the difficult, quick and awkward transitions from one idea to the next. BAM, and you're in another world and you're not really sure who is speaking. I think the author could have made these changes more obvious and easier to comprehend without losing the intelligent tone of the work. It's worth reading, but one must pay attention."
3,Not for Heavy Use,"I bought this last spring and was disappointed. First, it arrived with 1 shelf and one pole piece missing. It took almost 4 weeks to get replacement parts. The shelves were light and flimsy so don't count on loading lots of heavy containers on them, though very suitable for lightweight containers. Made the mistake of temporarily sitting it outdoors last fall, staking it to the ground, and the first night a thunderstorm destroyed the zippered cover. STILL haven't been able to get a replacement cover."
4,"Great item, just a couple of problems","I wish there had been some information sent with this tree. I'm not a seasoned silk plant buyer. When the tree finally came, (I had to send the company an e-mail, asking when)it appeared to be quite stiff from packing, or so I thought. So I took the larger limbs and bent them some. I didn't realize that I had cracked them until I finished. They didn't break through. It arrived just in time for my Dad's 80th birthday party! I'm also thankful for Amazon.com for telling to write or it might now have gotten here on time. Thanks, KJ"
4,Cheering for the bad guy,"Okay it's rare that you cheer for the bad guy. But for this movie I'll make an exception. This is one of Rudolph Valentino's early movies (from 1918 I believe) and he plays the scheming Count Roberto. Of course you're supposed to be cheering for Mary (the ""heroine"") to find love and happiness. And I wanted to. I really did. Unfortunately I thought she was a pretty two dimensional twit. By the end I was actually hoping she might come to her senses and fall for Count Roberto. The plot would have been much more interesting. Sadly that doesn't happen.Either way Rudolph Valentino's part is well acted and actually quite interesting. The rest of the cast is just okay but still watchable. I can't say this is the best silent movie I've ever watched but it's worth a view if you're interested in silents or Rudolph Valentino. Though his part is pretty restricted you can really see how good an actor he was. Like I said, I was cheering for the bad guy and that doesn't happen very often."
5,I'm a Silent and Valentino Fan,"I discovered Silent Films after watching ""The Artist"". I've been hooked ever since. They don't lecture, don't propagandize, just entertain. Their special effects are dismal or non-existent, however, their lack of pretense is refreshing. They're there to tell the story."
2,"Admire the star, deplore the plot","This is not a top-notch silent film, this is a melodrama. When I think of melodrama I think of unbelievable characters and unbelievable plots. In this film we have a witness to murder who waits ten years and then cracks a safe to steal the murder weapon, a lawyer who is employed to uncover corruption but doesn't find any, and a gigolo who marries a girl as part of an attempt at blackmail! I can't trace all the plot holes - it gives me a headache trying to unravel it all. Valentino is smooth and casual in his portrayal of a gigolo, very effective. The overall impression I have of this movie is this: it's a production-line melodrama where the plot doesn't matter much, just give the audience some plush interiors to look at and some dramatic moments, and rake in the money."
5,homeless to harvard,"I ALWAYS ENJOY A TRUE STORY THAT IS NOT TOO SUGARY SWEET,BUT STILL IS A SENTIMENTAL FEEL GOOD STORY. I WAS GLAD FOR THE EXTRA INTERVIEWS."
5,Phenomenal!,This is one of the most inspirational and truly miraculous stories I have ever heard. The story is very well portrayed by the actors in this film. It was also very well produced and I felt as though each scene gave a vivid interpretation of the factual events. This is one of the most outstanding films I have ever seen and I highly recommend it.
1,DVD Didn't Work,"The story is wonderful; however, I could only view the first 30 minutes. The DVD was defective. What a disappointment."
2,Loved the Book,"Would recommend reading the book version of this story. It is wonderful and inspirational. Didn't get passed the first few minutes of this DVD. I guess I don't need to see the horrid conditions that she lived in....when I read the book, my mind created the pictures for me and that was enough."
4,Good but Brief,"This book is very clear, but is mostly a collection of work with very little explanation. This is good when you understand the concepts; there is less to lead you astray. However, if you don't grasp an idea from what is provided, there is little recourse. I used this book in conjunction with the (ubiquitous) Stewart multivariate calculus book. It's not very expensive so I reccomend it."
4,- - Review - -,"This video features many older gymnasts such as Cathy Rigby, Kurt Thomas, Bart Conner, Mary Lou Retton, and Tim Daggett. It also shows routines from the early ages of Kim Zmeskal, Shannon Miller, Dominique Moceanu, and more. This may not appeal to younger gymnasts who are not firmilar to older gymnasts, but they may enjoy seeing performances from them and learning about them too. These performances are basically 10.0 performances, which is why they made the golden moments. If you enjoy seeing old routnies and gymnasts then this is the movie for you."
3,U.S. championships Golden Moments,"This video is all highlights of the National Championship competitions. There is no Olympic footage in this film, with the possible exception of a beam routine by Cathy Rigby which was clearly an amature video with added commentary. Nadia is in this video for about 5 seconds (no gymnastics) and Kerry Strug is not in it at all which is ashame. Another reviewer in this section states that Strug appears in the video, but only her name is mentioned. There are a lot of great routines in this video, but it would have been nice to see some Olympic performances. Overall the video is okay and entertaining, but it was definitely not what I had anticipated based on other reviews in this section."
3,Great Performances but a little disappionted.,"I bought this video because I thought the past performances were olympic and/or world championship meets. They covered old performances that were very good but they failed to highlight each gymnast best events and were cut short. The majority of the meets covered were national meets. I did like the way that they gathered ""off"" events(for each competitor) that you probably won't be able to see on TV again."

1,Not Apple Pectin! Corn,"This is not Apple Pectin which is what it is posted to be. This product has corn. It doesn't even say which part of the corn. Unlikely that it is the kernels. The corn is not listed in ingredients. The back label says this is "" apple pectin fiber"". Additional ingredients: None. It skips a few spaces and then ""Contains Corn"". I did not open this product. I only wanted Apple pectin.This is not Apple Pectin. Apple Pectin does not have corn in it. If the seller had posted the back label, I would have known this was not Apple Pectin. If Amazon required sellers to post the image of the label required by federal law on the bottle, customers would not be ordering totally inappropriate items. Please ask Amazon to change the policy on this.The seller, American Sports Nutrition, is not responding to my complaint.I will never buy from this seller again. I will never buy ""Life Extension"" products again."
3,Apple Pectin,"Relatively expensive as I can buy liquid Certo 6 oz. in the grocery store for $3.99 a package. Was $16.06 for 8 oz. powder from you. Very hard to blend in with juice. Had to use a blender. Thus not convenient. I can mix the Certo with a spoon which works well. Overall your product is good, but hard to work with for my purpose."
3,gross,This a powder not capsules.. I'm sure it would be fine in capsules but drinking it in water is pretty gross.
5,another great Bruder product,Great toy. Well constructed. great attention to detail. Have purchased 2 other Bruder construction equipment toys All made with great quaility. Would recommend to anyone.
3,Road Loader,"Purchased this truck for my 4 year old grandson. I'm not sure how long it will last based on it's plastic construction. It's very nicely detailed, but for a vehicle that's meant to be played with outside, it does not appear to be very durable. I do miss the old Tonka trucks!"
2,not worth the money,We got this as a Christmas gift this morning. And not even a full day and a piece broke off. My son is almost 4yr old and loves loves all construction trucks and was so excited to receive this. Although he still loves the truck with the broken piece. I knew as soon as he opened it that piece was going to brake and half way through the day I found it on the floor. It's the little think sticking up from the hood. I think where the steam blows?? I can't believe a toy that is meant for a 3yr old could be made like this. I'm so disappointed in bruder. My son loves bruder and that's all he wanted for the holidays he recieved 2 bruder trucks and I won't be buying them for him anymore. I'll stick with the metal tonka trucks. Wasted my money!
1,very over priced,It is very bad value for the money you pay. Made of cheap plastic and won't hold up to test of my three year old grandson. Was totaly disappointed in product.
3,you call this dark brown???,"I ordered a pair of brown sandals and was stunned to see that they were a dark grey when they arrived. Since I did not want to hassle with a return, I went ahead and used them. In spite of being the wrong color, they are a most comfortable sandal. Please, please, on the website, make your pictures match the product you are sending."
3,Not Mozart,"I am finding it extremely difficult to ""enter"" these interpretations - it just doesn't sound like Mozart to me. There is little spontaneity, the playing is stiff and contrived.Courtly grace seems more appropriate to Haydn - and indeed the Haydn's Opus 33 recording by Q. Mosaiques, which I have, is very beautiful (I don't think Haydn playing could get any better) - but with Mozart, at least to me, they miss the lightness of step required to bring these works to life.I am disappointed - I still feel the need to buy other interpretations for greater access to these quartets. This group (Q Mosaiques) has a cult following - and although their followers insist that they are ""correct"" and ""accurate"", I would say that perhaps they are predominantly ""academic"", which sometimes results in inauthentic-sounding performances - like these."
5,A great help!,"I really like Gromacki's book. He does an excellent job of hitting the high points of the N.T. This is not a complete commentary, if thats what you're looking for, but I didn't expect it to be. I used this to help teach a N.T. survey class in our Bible Institute. Good stuff."
4,good purchase,This purchase went exactly as it should have. No problems at all. Product was as described.
3,step daughters costume,well over all i havent seen it yet but as soon as i get it i will post a review
3,Successful?,"An interesting film that I don't believe was entirely successful. The premise, a revolutionary group recognized by rank and function by the names of days, months and seasons that falls apart and betrays itself, is a clever one, but the dialogue is often too repetitive and cryptic to draw you in further. I'd like to see more from this director, but I think this film fell short its mission. I saw the VHS version so I can't comment on the DVD extras, if there are any or not."
1,Too complicated for me,Need something more simple to help with the chronic fatigue. I simply do not enjoy the more intellectual books and need books to be more simple and simply stated.May be good for those intellectual types though!
2,It does not look anything like the picture,"Really, all this is is a glass paperweight. Its clear and doesn't look nearly as brilliant as the picture. Mine came scratched up and nicked. I'll still keep it in my office, but don't be deceived."
3,A Simple Twist,"The ending of this movie had an interesting twist which I myself enjoyed, or found funny, but others might hate. I reccomend watching this movie ONLY if you HAVE SEEN any of River Phoenix's other movies already. If you see his style of acting first then you will know why River himself didn't like making the movie that much...although I did love the ending."
2,Nice,"There is no ""capioned for the hearing-impaired"" as it written on the packageFor a German guy this would have helped"
4,Coming of Age Movie.,"I had mixed feelings before viewing this movie, because many critics called it a bomb and Phoenix, himself, did not like making this movie. This turned out to be a very good movie. Pheonix, looks so natural in the role as if he wasn't even acting (like all his other performaces.) I had the same ""bittersweet"" type feeling at the end of this movie like I did in ""Stand by Me."" Strangeley, I find movies like this a sense of inspiration. ""A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon"" is directed quite well, has good supporting performaces, but it's Phoenix who makes it so great. The ending with the ""Nothing is beyond you"" poster is very cool. RIP Phoenix. e-mail DEATHSQUAD'S HWANG at tommyfresh@webtv.net"
5,Slept on classic,This film is one of the best coming of age films ever made. It's defintely one of the best teen films of the 80's. We lost a great actor in the making when we lost River Pheonix. Check it out you won't be disappointed.
3,A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon,"It's a decent movie. Had some really funny moments. If you're a River Phoenix fan or a fan of 80's comedies, you have to watch this. I liked the movie, but I'm a also a huge River Phoenix fan. There is nothing overall special about the script or the characters, but the acting of Phoenix is good. You also get to see a very young Matthew Perry, who would later go on to star on the sitcom Friends."
3,"Not great, but interesting","It's an okay movie, kinda funny/kinda melodrama. The most interesting thing for me was seeing a very young Matthew Perry as Phoenix's buddy. Worth catching on the comedy channel if nothing else."
4,A Classic of a previous age,"When I first read this I had no idea that he was startinga type of writing that would catch on. Reading :""Archimedes' Revenge""by Paul Hoffman, I realized that he was using the same techniques that Martin Gardner had.One of Hoffman's examples is the same Möbius band in a new context.The perfect numbers are also in both books as well as a section onstrange tiling effects. That the Harter -Heighway dragon was introducedhere as well makes the book a classic of the last age of mathematical innocence,before mathematical genealogy took over."
2,Crown Prince Anchovies--Not good!,"I went on line to buy good, firm, jar anchovies. This was a real disappointment. Same consistancy as the canned ones. Wouldn't order again."
5,"healthy snack, etc.","eating right out of jar very good. Great too for ""Sicilian Speghetti"", pizza, etc. Happy to get my low mercury BPA free source of fish."
5,Fantastic,"Wonderful packaging, small glass containers full of anchovy goodness that you can throw in the frige after extracting what you need. Clean tiny boned (very edible) fillets are perfect for anything from sauce to toppings. Due to other reviews, I recommend using the first fillets you pull out from the middle for sauce (slightly broken up), the the others come out whole just fine with a cocktail fork.I will order these again and again."
1,NUTRITIONAL INFORMATION PLEASE ; SALT/SODIUM CONTENT???,"WHAT??? IS THE SODIUM/SALT CONTENT ; EVERY ANCHOVIE PRODUCT I EVER CAME ACROSS HAS : ""KILLER/DEADLY"" AMOUNTS OF ""SALT/SODIUM"" , SO MUCH SO , THAT THEY ARE RENDERED ""UNEATABLE/NON FOOD/DEADLY"" ; EXCESSIVE SALT/SODIUM INTAKE IS KNOWN TO CAUSE ""ALL KINDS"" OF PHYSICAL ALIMENTS"" , ESPECIALLY WHEN INGESTED OVER LONGER PERIODS OF TIME >"
2,Mushy,"The title says it all, these are mushy. Soft to begin with, by the time you get them out of the jar they are no longer fillets but anchovy mush. I won't buy these again."
2,"Mushy anchovies, no better than cheap ones in the tins.","I am angry every time I open another jar of these mushy, dark, anchovies. They are not reddish like the firm imported anchovies. Impossible to get a whole one out of jar as they don't stay in one piece. Great for making Caesar Salad dressing because they are already mashed. Ugh! Six more jars to go. Never again."
2,Look at the shape of the jar,"The anchovies are packed in tightly. The jar seemed like an improvement over the standard tin - less messy, easily stored leftovers - but the mouth is too small for easy access. In order to remove them from the jar, you have to tear a number of them apart. This isn't that difficult because they are mushy to begin with. They taste fine, but by the time you get then on your pizza, they have become short strips or anchovy dots."
3,Lightning Head - Studio Don,"Bigga Bush continues his dub-based takeover of the world with STUDIO DON, the first album under his new moniker Lightning Head. And while you can't escape the dub, you can at least groove to it. The snappy lyrical patter and slightly unpredictable drum hits of ""Me and Me Princess"" keep things interesting, while the unmistakable steel drums brighten up ""E.V.A."" and ""Steelsation."" ""Superfunky Bird"" is an apt self-descripton, as is ""Bassdrum and Snare,"" but the latter seems to be lacking something distinctive. Unfortunately, that could also be said of a good chunk of the album as well, which makes track like ""Step On Out,"" which puts plenty of echo into its languor, and ""2nd Line Stomp"" noteworthy. And though he shows real interest in pushing the dub form further, like on ""Raggasalsa,"" this album seemed crammed full of good ideas, but without only some of them coming to fruition."
5,A bridge between Project Management and SW Architecture,"This is the book I have been waiting for. It builds a bridge between Project Management and Software Architecture, the two most important aspects that contribute to the success of a software project. Usually Project Manager's view on a solution is different from Architect's and vise versa. Architecture-Centric Project Management helps the Project Manager to think from Software Architecture perspective and plan accordingly. I also liked the section about managing international development. We face the same issues mentioned in the book while dealing with global development. This book along with Applied Software Architecture by Hofmeister et al. is a good recipe for a successful software project."
5,A Magical Ambience,"I love this album! Such great listening, the ambience is sublime. It has been my ultimate chill out CD for years :)"
3,a mixed bag,"I bought this album knowing I was taking a chance. I loved ""The Shortest Stare"" and hoped that the rest of the album held my attention as well. Sadly I was wrong. ""The Shortest Stare"" seems to be the highlight and everything else seems too whimsical and aloof for my current tastes."
1,there's a sucker born every minute!,"Ya, it said widescreen on the product details, so I thought,FINALLY, I can get rid of my letter boxed lazer disc versions of these two movies...Boy did I get a wrong number.Amazon'sproduct details are wrong.These two features are full screen!NOT wide screen.I called Amazon's customer service(800-201-7575)and they were happy to refund my money,as soon as I returnedthe disc.Oh, by the way,at Warner home video this disc is listedas FULL SCREEN(as of 8/30/06).I'm still waiting for the widescreen version."
4,A good find,I really liked this movie pack and my grandfather who I bought it for really enjoyed it to. For those who enjoy these actors do not disappoint .
1,Corporate greed continues unabated,"The ""Grumpy Old Men"" movies are very funny and very well produced. They were produced at a visual aspect of 1.85:1. However, they have never been released on DVD at that ratio. They have been slashed down to 1.33:1 ... the so-called ""full"" screen ratio. ""Full"" screen is the rip-off industry's euphemism for ""mutilated"". A truly FULL screen is the screen of the original production.If you want to buy this butchered product and miss fully 30% of the original films, go ahead. Let me know if you do: I have some nice riverside property in New Orleans I'd like you to consider buying."
4,Old age happens,"The seniors among us usually don't just sit in rocking chairs watching the tube. Their inner youth is still playful, although their bodies (and often their families) can be less than cooperative. Great movie to open the door for discussion in family topics' classes."
5,Hilarious,"How can you NOT love Walter and Jack together. Such a feel good movie -- both of them and Burgess Meredith is simply wonderful as ""Pop"""
5,Grumpy & Grumpier...,"This movie is about 2 old men fighting over a women, Typical men...Not!!These men have known each other since they were little kids...they are kinda jealous of each other after all these years.I'd say it's a funny romantic comedy.I rate these movies a 5 of 5 stars!!"
4,Great movie/ Price but not Widescreen,"I love these two movies and got them for my Dad for Christmas. The price was excellent. Only problem was that they were in 4:3 format. He'll never realize it, but it still bothered me."
3,A mediocre,"I noticed a lot of angry reviews for this new dvd release because the films aren't in widescreen, and I can't say that I blame them. I bought these films on VHS years ago but didn't buy the first dvd releases of them because they weren't in, you guessed it, widescreen. I can see how really big fans of them would be upset by that. It does seem funny to me because in the past Warner Bros. has rereleased films like ""A Christmas Story"" and ""Ace Ventura:Pet Detective"" in widescreen, the latter just last week. This rerelease of the ""Grumpy"" films looks to me like the original dvd releases put on one disk, as the menus and special features seem to indicate so. But the back of the case clearly says fullscreen, so you can't try to sue Warners or anything like that. But one does have to wonder why, if they were going to rerelease them, they wouldn't make new menus, and release them in WIDESCREEN."
1,Widescreen ... That's a big LIE !!!,"I've been waiting for years since the LaserDisc release.What's up with this. Advertised as WS, but on the back clearly states FS.As Ray Davies said ... ""Give the People what they want!""WE DON'T WANT THIS"
5,Funny!,These two movies are hilarious! Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthow are some of the best comics ever. As funny now as when they were younger. Movie is as funny now as wihen they first came out.
1,Grumpy Old Men audio makes me grumpy,"If I could have rated this Blu-Ray lower than one star, I would have. It is unplayable on my system, specifically in conjunction with my Pioneer Elite VSX-03 receiver. As others and I have discovered, the English audio setting (DTS-HD MA 2.0) does not play on Grumpy Old Men (the French and Spanish tracks play just fine). This makes the disc worthless. Some others have found that if they fiddle with the output settings on their Blu-Ray player they can get the audio to work, but that is a ridiculous expectation for WB to make of their customers. I would return this to Amazon, but it is now outside of their 30-day return policy. I will be contacting WB directly and insisting they give me a refund."
1,Be warned....,"The single star is just to alert everyone to a defect in this Blu-Ray disc. If you use an HDMI cable to connect your Blu-Ray player to your televison, you will have no sound on ""Grumpy Old Men"". If you use an S-Video connection, you will have sound. ""Grumpier Old Men"" plays fine either way. I returned this item twice, and all three discs had the same problem. I also tried playing on a friend's Blu-Ray player with the same result. This is clearly a manufacturer's defect. It is certainly not Amazon's fault, but they should either contact the manufacturer or stop selling until the problem is corrected. I should note that Amazon was very responsive to the problem and refunded the cost of the disc immediately. Great movies. Too bad we have to deal with the technical difficulties."
2,Audio problems,"Love both movies & have not seen in years. Much unresolved trouble with the blu ray so cannot watch it.Cannot hear the DTS Master Audio 2.0 sound track in the Blu Ray ""Grumpy Old Men.""I can hear audio just fine for any other Blu Ray DTS MA or Dolby True HD & any DVD.My equipment is Panasonic DMP BD 80 Blu Ray player & Pioneer Sc 05 AVR.My AVR is set to automatically detect the audio format; Dolby True HD, DTS Master Audio, Dolby 5.1, Mono, Stereo, etc. It does do this & when playing the movie in question it does display: "" DTS Master Audio."" But, no sound. I tried the Spanish & the French track & they play just fine but they are not DTS Master Audio. 2nd movie audio plays just fine & but it is DTS Master Audio 5.1.I already sent the movie back to Amazon for an exchange & the replacement has the same problem. I emailed WB Home entertainment & didn't get a reply.Warner Home VideoP.O. Box 30620Tampa, FL 33630-0620E-mail address: whv@b3custserv.com.Phone Number: (800) 364-6928"
4,Relaxing Sounds--Mostly,"Very well-recorded CD, even though there are baby alligators ""barking"" and adults growling--had to get used to them (I've never been in the Bayou). Peepers, crickets, warblers and owls mask my severe Tinnitus very well, enabling me to fall asleep. Recommend using any of these types of CDs with a ""Sound Pillow"" and a portable CD player to avoid potentially bothering others in the room. :)"
4,cosy mitts,"Mine look more yellowy than these putty looking ones, more golden.I like them, very soft & flexible. The fur inside is not like a western sheeps wool, it's more silky, not so wiry. a few clumps of fur have fallen out from inside, but not much. They are warm & look good. The cuffs are short so fit under your coat cuff fine. They arn't super classy but are good everyday winter wear. Gloves are easy to loose so I'm happy with these."
5,talented debut,"this c.d. is one of the best debut efforts since ""new miserable experience"" by Gin Blossoms. clearly the best song on the C.D. is ""mr. golden deal"". one of the few cds i can listed to from beginning to end without skipping tracks. great for anyone. ballads are well done and ""harder"" songs are well done too and not just noise like a lot of the newer groups out there."
5,Excellent album,"Open Up Your Eyes, Casual Affair, If You Could Only See, Thick, Wicked Soldier, Lemon Parade and all the rest are great. The first three songs are incredible and Casual Affair is my personel favorite."
5,Awesome CD from an awesome band,"Tonic has become an absolute favorite of mine. Lemon Parade got me started with them. There is not a bad song on the CD. They have such a polished sound, definitely a great songwriting group. I saw them live recently and they backed up their great studio performances. I promise you will be playing this CD over and over."
5,Tonic is far from bitter,"Tonic has some very inspiring lyrics and an excellent style of music. I am very glad to own a great cd like this one, and you should be too when you pick this one up. It got a few negative reviews, but so what, That's just an opinion. If you appreciate all great rock/acoustic music then get this one."
5,One of the best albums I have in my collection,"As I live in the UK I had never listened to Tonic before. By chance on a recent visit to the US I heard the song ""If you could only see"". I was hooked ! Every song on the CD is excellent. Have they made any more ?"
4,If you could only hear...,"The song ""If You Could Only See"" was haunting me for months, never heard who the artist was any time I heard it on the radio. I found it by searching the lyric on amazon, and Tonic came up in the results. A soundbite gave me the confirmation I needed, and I purchased a great used copy from one of amazons marketplace sellers.The rest of the CD is pretty good, but obviously, you know what my favorite song is! For the price I paid, even if that WAS the only good cut, I still got my moneys worth!"
2,If you could only see how little talent we have!,"That should be the name of this album. Granted they have about four good songs on this album, and in this case I use the word album loosely, but the rest of the songs are pure CRAP!! I had hoped for a better effort after I had first heard their song If You Could Only See the way She Loves me on the radio but I am GREATLY disappointed. I won't even bother trying to sell this one to a used CD store for fear some other misguided soul may actually accidently purschase it, god only knows how this crap might damage them. After listening to this crap I need some tonic to get over it."
2,Why I feel this way.,"I sit & listen to this album & wonder why I ever bought it & why I never pawned it in one of my many attempts to scrounge up drinkin' money. I really only bothered to listen to a few songs on the album but, those were enough to make me want to hold on to it. Track one,three & four are my fav's. My point, if you could call it a point, is that IF YOU COULD ONLY SEE & OPEN UP YOUR EYES are trance inducing songs. The words & the lingering guitar drag me in every time I listen. I start to daydream about where I was when I 1st heard Tonic. The funny part is the daydreams are never the same but they are always just as real & just as warm."
1,Another forgettable and boring band,"This disc found its way into my home and turns out to be indistinguishable from any number of other generic, boring, unoriginal bands. You can certainly find many, many better albums. Try instead checking out anything by Elvis Costello or Ben Folds Five or Marshall Crenshaw or..."
1,I hate lemons.,"To be honest, I really wanted to give this album no stars. Why? These pranksters of ""mall-ternative"" friendly music has a chock full of crap in their brew of mediocre guitar-riffs and non-furious horn rhythms. This band is brimming with pirate look-alikes that need to walk the plank with Rob Thomas and his zany cohorts. These misfits of mayham either need to go back to music school or swab the deck."
1,HOW CAN U ACTUALLY LIKE THIS?,"Okay, I know this is going to get a lot of votes saying this review did not help me. But straight out, this CD stinks. I mean when I heard If You Could Only See on the radio, I was like ""Wow! This CD has to be good. Also all these people are giving it five stars."" Well the rest of the songs are not like that one hit. Its totally different. The reason why I got this CD was because of their new hit ""You wanted more"" on the American Pie Soundtrack? SO I thought this album was gonna be tyte. But the first 3 songs are the only catchy songs. The others are just boring and seem to have no catchy hooks. Or they are upbeat, incontrolled, songs that sound like ""BLAH"". So if you liked ""You Wanted More"" or ""If You Could Only See"" think twice before you get this album or get their latest one because it looks A LOT MORE improved."
1,NO SALT but very expensive Albacore tuna! $4.70 a can!,"You cannot return food items to Amazon, so be sure you want this before you get it:Crown Prince Natural Solid White Albacore Tuna in Water, No Salt Added, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12). It has no added salt, so if that is important to you, the tuna in the cans is very nice and the cans are BIG (12 oz, not 6 oz.) Amazon has other albacore tuna for less:Polar All Natural Solid White Albacore Tuna, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)."
5,canned tuna,I have tried two cans so far and every time it tastes better. I cannottell that there is no salt and neither can my wife. A great product every low salt fan can use.
1,Not their best.,Make your own rice and use the Eden bean of your choice for a better dinner. The canned beans are great.
3,Worthy of a dedicated Monks fan but not essential.,Sometimes you really only need to make one amazing statement to sum up your career. Black Monk Time is a monolithic effort which casts a shadow over the entire Monks diaspora. This record serves as a intriguing prelude to their magnum opus but does little to broaden their catalog. It's fascinating to hear the liturgical organ introductions to familiar tunes being performed in a much more restrained and civilized manner but it's no substitute for the euphoric racket to follow. To put it quite simply: it's too polite. They haven't reached critical mass with the anger that would make them true iconoclasts. But if you just can't get enough from one record and want to see the cracks forming in the dam it's worth investigating.
4,"C'more, you little cat!","Not as together as BLACK MONK TIME, nor as manic and hopped-up as the live stuff which slipped out on some of those Prae-Kraut Pandaemonium compilations, this is a fascinating look at the early Monks as a collective work-in-progress. Larry's signature churchy organ intro to every single song, you can imagine the arguments that went down before those came out for good. Gary's still not entirely sure how to howl/scream the songs, he's still singing them half the time. It's rave-up and I'm sure it sounded/worked a hell of a lot better live than comes across here. Nonetheless they rock like NOBODY else could, and when they're on, you feel it to your spinal cord.Not essential, but damn close. It's beat time! It's hop time! It's monk time!"
3,"Nice CD, but........","it fell short of my expectations. Then again, it's still worth purchasing because these two young ladies are awesome!"
3,It was alright.,"Some of the songs are really good, and the rest are just ordinary. But they seem like they can be really great, I would buy another cd."
1,"AWFULL, 12 DOLLARS DOWN THE DRAIN!!!!!!",I SHOULDNT EVEN GIVE THIS CD ONE STAR. IT DOESNT EVEN DESERVE IT. I WAS TOTALY UPSET WHEN I HEARD THIS CD. WILL THE REAL NEOSOUL ARTIST PLEASE STAND UP. BECUASE THEY NEED TO SIT DOWN. IM GETTING HEADACHE RIGHT NOW JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS ALBUM. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! USE IT ON MORE IMPORTANT THING LIKE A COMBO MEAL AT MCDONALDS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,"Wasn't what I expected, but not bad","I've been on a wave lately, purchasing what might be considered Neo-Soul and funky soul music. I was told this group would be a good one to purchase, but unfortunately I was a little disappointed. I don't think any music is a waste of money, but I probably would've bought something else had I known this CD wasn't impressive. Don't get me wrong, I like some of the grooves on this CD, but it wasn't as phenomenal as India.Irie's two CDs, nor the sleeper of the year - KINDRED, Family Soul's new release (Surrender to Love - Hidden Beach labelmates of Jill Scott.)I think these two ladies are talented, they should try again and bring the noise a little louder this time, that's all."
4,As above-great fun,"This outing by nephew of ""THE"" Ted Nash is one of great humor and charm while sill delivering the goods.This is big acceptance from me because I couldn't stand Ray Draper led recordings or Tuba in any small group setting.But here with violin and accordion (almost as dreaded to me as jazz harmonica-Toots Thieman has spoiled so many nice LP's for me but that another review).But here avoiding a somber tango treatment is fun record that many will enjoy even if they have same reservations about violin,accordion and tuba needing to ""stay in their place"" s to speak.But hear it just works and is charming."
1,not 'naturally flavored with white truffle',"This is artificial truffle flavour (2,4-dithiapentane) in a vegetable oil base. I've contacted the manufacturer and they admitted that this oil has never been in contact with actual white truffles. Completely misleading product (see [...]"
3,Another solid track from Outkast,"Outkast's 3rd single off ""ATLiens"", ""Jazzy Belle"", isn't as good as their previous songs, but it's solid nonetheless. The beat isn't anything spectacular, but there's some good scratching in the hook. The beat is on-par with ""Elevators"", the 2nd single off ""ATLiens"", but the hook isn't nearly as catchy. Still, another great release from Outkast, definately worth checking out if you're a fan."
3,Decent...slightly off though,"You have to be an Amis fan to appreciate this. Along the lines of the drug infested Brit-Lit invasion (see also Irvine Welsh), this just gets a little tiring in the middle. For a better Amis read, check out Money first. If you've read that, this is a good little read."
4,pleasantly nauseating,"Worth reading if only for Keith, the repugnant dwarf. The book is usually funny and occasionally disturbing, like most of Amis' work. Read it. Please."
4,"Morbid, macabre sobre humour, profound sarcasm and despair.","The words of Martin present a Joycean talent. The storyline is as addictive as any hyper-drug. the characters are vivid, luminous carricatures of dead human babies"
1,No Glue?,"I tried to read this book, but as I turned page one it just fell off the spine. I finally gave up at page 14. Oh well, the book looked like it was in good condition."
5,"Compelling, dazzling, grotesque.","I gave this book to a friend of mine, and she said it was the only book she'd ever read that made her physically ill. But she finished it. This book chronicles the adventures of some English twentysomethings sharing a house during the 70s. Of course there's the typical sex and drugs, as well as bizarre art movements, a family of dwarves, physical violence, and murder; but the real star is Amis' style -- vibrant and horrifying, never letting you respond any one way at any particular time. His control over the language is astounding, his authorial voice ever-elusive, and his moral sense is omnipresent and yet never simplistic or heavy-handed. This book is not genius, but it is an early work by a wunderkind who would realize his genius in ""London Fields"". Read it for the fun, the style, and the stomach pains."
3,Martin Amis chugs out a second rate novel,"Come on Martin, you can do better than this! It took me ages to read this book, which in truth is more of a play than a novel. The structure heaved, and the ending was easy. NO real surprises either, for an apparently 'shocking' book. I always look forward to the bit where Martin enters the fray though, in his little authorial asides. Nothing compared to Money."
4,"In a list of great things, Dead Babies are near the top.",This book was very interesting. It is about a strange assortment of people with a propensity for casual drugs and sex. Their mischief is upset when each of them finds a message about their greatest fear from an anonymous author. It's a good read if you can keep your mental images from becoming too graphic.
2,A Disappointment,"Initially, this book looked rather promising. Amis's stylistic touches were nice as usual and for the first hundred or so pages it seemed as though this was really building up towards an intense and revealing climax. Unfortunately, Amis failed to make the plot nearly as interesting as the setting or characters. The ending was horrid and sudden and although it appeared to say something, it really said nothing about either our condition or the mindset of the characters. All in all, an easy read with its fair share of good lines and amusing scenes, but ultimately as unsatisfying as the drugs the characters intake."
3,Solid Frazer Story; Poorly Published,"While Frazer uncharacteristically leaves the story with loose ends (i.e. the Duchess of Suffolk just simply disappears from the story), this is a solid Sister Frevisse novel. I can't help but point out how very disappointing the quality of the publishing is--so many mispellings, duplicate words (i.e. and and), missing words. While this is not unusual in publishing these days, it's always disapointing. And, for me, always disrupts my enjoyment of the book. Alas for automated proofreading!"
3,Should have been so much better,"I've seen a production of the original script (college), the movie version, the Broadway revival, and this version when it was first shown on PBS. While the performers were adequate, something about the pacing of this performance cast a pall over the show. The director opted to have characters draw out sequences that would have played better up to speed (Act I finale) and let other characters toss their lines away so quietly and so quickly that I wouldn't have known what was said had I not been so familiar with the show (Bill Calhoun). I tend to collect as many Broadway and movie musicals as I can, but this effort will not become part of it. If you have never seen a version of the show before, you should find it mildly entertaining, otherwise see the older movie version."
2,Rachel is worth it,"I was very excited to see this, having seen the original cast (lead by Marin Mazzie and Brian Stokes Mitchell) on broadway. For some reason the energy of this cast does not transfer into the audience. Brent Barrett, I'm sorry to say, is a sad replacement for Stokes.The one reason I'd give to watch this is Rachel York, who seems to be perfect in just about every role she takes on. I saw and loved Marin Mazzie, but Rachel York can certainly hold her own. She has a wonderful voice, amazing comic timing, and is quite beautiful on top of it all. She embodies Lily Vanessi brilliantly in this production. It's just a shame that her fellow cast-members can't do the same."
2,"Great voices, bad editing","We were very disappointed at the presentation, and may return the disc. Some production aren't worth keeping in our library, and this may be one. The view jumps frequently and annoyingly, especially during the dance sequences. Flashing to a closeup for half a second may have been fun in the editing booth, but is distracting on the screen. We couldn't tell if the choreography was bad, or simply looked that way due to inappropriate cuts and camera angles. A suggestion: when everyone's on stage in a big dance number, show the whole stage instead of jumping from one closeup to another.The story's funny, which is why we bought the DVD, but I can't recommend this DVD to anyone who expects to get the feeling of a live performance. It isn't even up to American Playhouse production (ie; low budget) standards."
3,"Love that Rachel York, but the production stalls","I'm definitely a Rachel York fan -- she was a SCREAM in the Broadway production of ""Victor/Victoria"". But on the whole this production of ""Kiss Me Kate"" seems a bit flat. The songs are fine if a bit dated in style, but the production design for the stage show comes across as a bit low-rent. It looks like very good amateur theatre at best.Rent this if you can before commiting to a purchase."
3,"A lovely play, great songs, better on B'way than London","This recording of the London revival of the play is good. It originaly began on B'way with Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie. They are MUCH better than the players in this recording.I saw the revival on B'way LIVE. Stokes had left, and Burke Moses took over, however he was out. I did manage to see Marin Mazzie in all her glory. She was full of it! (Glory, I mean) She was superb and wonderful. Stokes, I never saw, but heard on the CD. He is a terrific singer.The actors in this recording are good, but I still have to say, Stokes and Mazzie are mutch better!!!"
2,5 star songs 1 star production,This was a terrible production with no life and seemed jumpy and disjointed. It also felt thrown together and not well rehearsed with number dragging on longer than they should and others rushed. Rachel York was OK (she was better in Scarlet Pimpernel)but this is not her best performance at all.All in all a disponting version and hard to see how it won a Tony for best revival..but then this isn't the original cast from that Tony winning revival so that may be the problem.
2,Frantic and unfunny,"For $50 I would sit through this again. What a dreadful production, especially if you know the fine MGM musical of the same name. The singing is fair, the dancing is poor, the dialogue is mostly shouted (although the actors are miked), and the comics are totally unfunny. The sexual innuendoes are neither errotic or amusing. In short,find something better to do with an evening. Like watching a network sitcom."
1,Buy the Original Cast (1953) Instead,"IMHO, none of the cast could hold a candle to the original with Howard Keel, Kathryn Grayson, etc. These shows are all about the music - if the music doesn't make it, the whole production isn't worth two cents."
4,Acting and camera,"I actually saw the National Tour with Rachel York in it, and I was excited to see this video. I loved the acting of York and Barrett and I thought Nancy Anderson was very cute as Lois/Bianca. York's voice is gorgeous. Except for those three however, the DVD leaves much to be desired. The performances of the gangsters are merely okay, and occasionally annoying. The filming definitely could have been better and I hated some of the cuts, like 1/4 of ""We Open in Venice"", as well as some plot points such as when Fred discovers that Bill actually signed the IOU, and the DVD didn't have any extras, which disappointed me. I'd recommend it, if only so that one can see the Broadway Revival version, which is beautiful from it's costumes, lights, and direction. As for Bill Calhoun, while I very much admire his voice and dancing talent, the acting was not up to the par of his costars."
4,hell freezes over,"After years of Gene talking about never getting married he does just that. Season 6 is split into 2 dvd sets while it could have easily fit all in 1 dvd set. Sounds like greed, but was it A&E's idea or Gene Simmons's idea or both."
5,Unexpected emotion,"This season of Gene Simmons Family Jewels has been amazing. The family is so transparent about their life and their happiness and pain. The episode of the Wedding Boot Camp had me in tears. We all have issues in our past, relationships within our family and those we love where we need to take a closer look, say some things out loud, and forgive so that we can heal and move on. This was Gene and Shannon doing that and it was really inspiring and made me want to do the same. I wish them and their families all the best and appreciate the glimpse into their lives."
3,sad,this show even though is scripted has jumped the shark. I am glad it got cancelled just for the kids sake shannon should be ashamed for her behavior as should gene.
2,Content great if the dvd worked properly,This is the second copy of the dvd I received from Amazon. The first copy I ordered froze during the very first episode on the first disc. I returned the product for a replacement but the second copy has the same issues. I do not want to return it as I will have to wait another 2+ weeks for another copy which could have the same problem for the third time. I don't know if there were a particular batch of badly encoded dvds but I'd rather have some of the content than spend more money trying to replace it with another glitched product. I just wish it worked properly as I do enjoy the show.
4,"Gymnastics: The Trials, The Triumphs, The Truth","I thought that the book was excellent! It was very well written and it covered a lot of important and interesting things. I would've rated this book at 5 star, but I heard that in a short story about a girl that died because her head slammed into the vault and her neck snapped, then she went into a coma and died, the author didn't mention that when she was in the hospitol her air tube came out and they couldn't put it back in, and that's what made her go into a coma ( and as a result die) that made me angry because I expect the REAL facts when I read a book."
4,It was very informative,I thought that this gymnastic book was a very good one in the sense that some one who has never really learned about the sport wrote a book on it with his opinion and that says a lot to me that people are willing to try to give gymnastics a chance.
5,Streamlight helps keep you flying safe!,"I am in Aircraft Maintenance, working the 3rd shift. It goes without saying that I do most of my work around aircraft without the light of day. The Stinger HT HP is just what I was hoping for in a flashlight, durability and a good strong beam. The beam produced by this flashlight is somewhat yellowish, but bright enough to see the tip of the vertical stabilizer on a B767. If you can purchase this flashlight for less than $90, it's very worth it. I did have my eye on the next one up, the Super Stinger XT HP, which was supposed to be nearly twice as bright, but I opted not to because the flashlight was a bit longer than I was willing to carry around all night (if you are someone that is over 6' tall, go for the Super Stinger)."
5,Learn to warm your hands,I've been happy with this product. It takes practice to learn to change one's blood flow to the tips of the hands. This little device gives you the feedback needed to know if you are succeeding or not.
2,Their earlier work is better.,"I will give this CD two stars only because one piece, ""Shanghai Gumbo"" really shines! And even this track seems bland once compared to the awesome live version they released on ""Road Scholars"". The other tracks are really nothing special and they have lost their catchy, melodic style that was so Spyro Gyra back on ""Alternating Currents"" and before. The melodies are much more random here.I recommend one of their earlier recordings or the live ""Road Scholars"" before I'd recomment this one."
3,like the book,"It has pretty heavy handling marks, but I am very pleased to have it and like the book very much."
5,This is a good book too,"Another lure book, if you like fishing (or even better if you are an addict like me) you will find this book interesting. It will send you to sleep if you don't like fishing or the history associated with the ways and means of catching fish. Like other companion books, these are beautifully presented with nice photo's and informative text. Sorry I haven't done a book review since high school."
2,"Great concept, poor execution","The butterflies are attractive, although the gold/yellow one is nearly opaque. Unfortunately, the design is prone to breaking. The butterlies are heavy and subject to movement in the wind, but they are held in place on their stakes with a poorly welded clasp that cannot be repaired if broken.My green butterfly snapped within a week of being place on my terrace. I finally hung it in a window (sans stake) because I could not get it on to the mounting stake and bringing in to be welded would be a foolish exercise for such an inexpensive item.I would think the smaller butterflies by the same manufacturer would be equally attractive and less susceptible to breaking.Bob"
5,"Vintage Sci-Fi, and worth reading!","Ahh, this is grand Sci-fi from the old swashbuckling days of Sci-fi space opera. Our heroes from the Legion appear yet again to save mankind. My favorite, Giles Habibula (based on Falstaff) appears once again in this time twisting adventure.Turn off your expectation of hard Sci-fi, and strap on your blaster, fire up the Geodyne engines and we are off!"
4,Not intense yellow color,Bulbs are very yellow as far as yellow bulbs go but if you want that intense Tuner/Lexus fog light effect then you need yellow film. I'm still glad I purchased the bulbs and they have lasted almost a year at this point I believe.
1,"Short life, not yellow.","Bulb is yellow when off, but the light output is pretty much just white when lit. I noticed no increase in brightness over a standard 55 watt bulb, and both of mine burned out in less than 60 days. Went back to standard 55 watt Sylvania bulbs."
4,Haven't installed yet,We ordered these for my car but they were the wrong ones so we did not install or use them
1,What Awful Writing!,"While the aurthian content is there, I can't imagine a worse job of trying to write for children. This is the ultimate in talking down to kids. I could barely get through it because the writing was so uninspired. There is nothing of the glory of the legend here, it is all merely plot and badly done at that. I bought it, then threw it out rather than give it to my kids."
1,Tommy Hilfiger Laguna Bay 200-Thread-Count Cotton twin long sheet set,"I was satisfied only with the length of delivery - it was timely. The sheets were faded in five places: 4 on the pillow case and one on the fitted sheet. The fitted sheet fade was about 4-5"" x 8"" and the pillow case was faded in 2 places, two on each side, so no way to ""just show the good side"". Would return it if I had the time... you know the drill - wrap it back up, trip to the post office, insure it for good measure and hope that your credit card will reverse the charges within the next six month... or at least hope for a replacement that won't be defective also... so, my review is written only to allow meticulous shoppers to know that the product I received was defective. thanks for the opportunity to vent..."
3,On the 3 side of 3 and a half stars,"This was an interesting book. Kline does a superior job in his description of the Biblical imagery of the Glory Cloud. I think his portrayal of God coming to confront Adam and Eve as the ""Day Spirit"" better than the ""cool of the day"" translations. But, he lets his imagination get away from him when he reinterprets ""us"" in Gen. 1:26."
3,Not for the faint-hearted,"Kline discusses the concept of the image of God as it relates to Old Testament prophets and priests. He makes some fascinating points, but the book is not for the faint-hearted: ""In the prophetic model, that eschatological destiny of redeemed mankind was proleptically anticipated in pneumatic reality""..."
2,A Candle for St. Jude,"I may not have given this book a chance, but I was not enamored with the subject in the first several chapters. I had other books to read, so I left it. I may go back and finish the book, and then, I might have a different opinion of it."
2,A Misleading Dissapointment,"Firstly, the two star review is because of the DVD itself, not the material contained on it. The episodes are from the first season of the original cartoon series, which I loved then and still do. I enjoyed reliving my childhood, but was not overwhelmed. The addition of Scourge on the cover (a character which did not appear until much later) made me expect espisodes that took place after the movie, when the characters and stories were much more indepth and intriguing. The remastering to DVD is laughable. Nothing on this particular DVD is superior to what a VHS version would contain. I can not see myself watching this DVD again, while I have watched Rhino's DVD of ' The Movie many times."
3,"It's nice to have them on a disc, but...","The picture quality is that of a VHS tape. If I wanted VHS quality on a disc, I would have burned my own VCD. No retouched video, no fixing the occasional mis-coloring (i.e. the Autobot Symbol turning puple or Transformers being mis-colored), no extras.... nothing...On a side note... I also bought the Heroes (Rebirth 1-3) DVD and it contained the same 3 episodes as this disc (the label on the disc does read Heroes). I wrote a review on here about it... but did anyone else have that problem?"
3,Buy the other sets instead,"I didn't buy this, but I'd recommend that if you want the Ultimate Doom episodes, plus the episodes ""Countdown to Extinction"" (where Starscream attempts to take over control of the Decepticons), ""A Plague of Insecticons"" (pretty self-explanatory) and ""Heavy Metal War"" (the first appearance of the Constructicons/Devastator), buy the Collector's edition Season 1, Volume 3. There's very little in the way of features, mainly just support for Dolby Digital and scene selection(which any decent DVD has anyway). Or you could just go with the complete boxed set-I only bought Volume 3 as it contained my personal favorite episodes."
5,Prime 80's cartoon series!,"Three episodes (3-parter) of the first season. No extras, average picture quality but better than VHS. Sound is very good quality, Dolby 5.1 remix but without disappointing special effects!I love it - think of buying the whole boxset!"
4,Another of Several Classics On This Topic,"There are several larger, hard cover text books regarding digital electronics that I like. Most of them are Prentice Hall books. You can stick with used editions printed after 2003 and get a fine piece of work for just a few dollars (formerly very expensice college texts) that is current enough for learning the core topics. This is one of the four or so that I put near the top of my list. Excellent use of color illustrations, real-life examples, etc. There might be two other books on this topic that I like better, but this is one of the classics."
4,I Zombie :- risk taking British horror with heart,"In many ways this film attempts to play with the genre, taking it a bit further, whilst not alienating fans. This viewer was often reminded of the early Universal films in so far as the main lead/creature successfully seduced the audience into feeling for its plight. It is rare that a modern horror movie encourages empathy. It is a challenging film but Mr Parkinson should be applauded for bringing to the screen that rarest of gems, a story that encourages us to think whilst it entertains. I for one look forward to this directors next film. We should be encourging such talent. Give it a try, after all it has got to be better than I Still Know What You Did Last Summer !"
3,I Zombie - Hmmm...,"Hmmm... I saw this movie a while back, and to tell u the truth, I wasn't all that impressed with it. This movie DOES have a plot, I think this movie lays in the more plot-ish prevails over butcher everything that moves category, lol. I didn't find this creepy at all. I think it's more depressing and drama-ish than ""Scary"" This one dude catches a disease & slowly starts turning into a, yup U guessed it, ZOMBIE! He trys to hide it and stuff, and plus he has a wife & he loves her very deeply, and he's running out of time before he becomes a dead guy Well, I don't wanna go on forever about the plot. Well, to sum this up, If ur expecting some gut-munching, throat-slashing, head-gushing mayhem, LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE! U will find none of that stuff here... Go watch Lucio Fulci's Zombie or Dawn of the Dead. Zombie Clasics! Hail the masters of Gore!"
1,Not A Very Good Movie,"Fangoria better be careful as to what they put their name on, cause trash like this movie is gonna bring their reputation down into the gutter. Most of this film is spent watching one guy go about his business, as he is slowly turning into a zombie. The film never seems to go anywhere,and for something to come out under Fangoria's banner, you would think there would be more horror to the story, but unfortunately there isn't. Boring, boring, boring, is the best I can say about it. Very little special effects. Mostly just on his zombie makeup. This is one movie I couldn't reccomend to anyone."
3,Zombie Film Lacks Bite,"Lame.Sorry. Don't get me wrong, this film isn't Bad...exactly...but for a zombie film it is lacking. I gave it three stars, mainly for the good characterization and such. It is a character driven affair and in this it excels, but if you are looking for Action, keep looking.The other problem is the gore. To much of it in my opinion, and worse yet, most of it is Not done well. Gore for gore sake works, but make it convincing, please.If you want a more ""arty"" ""My dinner with a newly dead guy"" type film, then by all means check it out. If you want something with more action, pass."
4,"I, Zombie's destine to be a classic with horror fans...","A tragic look into the life of a zombie. Frightening in a psychological sense, with a strong story and good characters. This film took me by surprise, because it's inventive, and doesn't try to spin the same old tale over again. I, Zombie could probably be categorized as a drama, instead of a horror flick, if it wasn't for the gore and zombie theme. Well worth your time if you don't mind an involved plot, and character development."
1,I wasted three bucks on this movie and didn't get a t-shirt,"I am scamming though the isle of the movie store and I come upon this little tape. Naturally I see a zombie on the cover as well as Fangoria's logo so I snatch it up. Now I am a huge fan of Fangoria films such as Children of the night, severed ties, and mindwarp and expected a campy B-horror movie that would make me laugh and keep me scared. INSTEAD, I get a documentary (no kidding)about some whiney British dude who gets bitten by a zombie and soon becomes one himself. I talked my girlfriend into watching this with me and thanks to this movie I am no longer allowed to pick horror movies anymore. Don't waste your money, rent Dawn of the Dead!"
4,the hum-bie mind,"this movie is unlike any other zombie film ive come into contact with, its a psycholgical movie that the lead character happens to be turning zombie.the effects a understandable for low budget but this movie deserves a look for other reasons. The story leaves you with not alot of closure but you feel satisfied because you know its best that way. The beginning,middle & end are all done well. Charcter building was just right. The zombie film is unique and this kind of story would be best if not ever attempted by anyone again."
3,Steal for under 5 bucks,"This is an Interesting film. It's sad in a lot of ways and humanizes the zombie state by moving you to feel for the main characters past as a human, and future as a zombie. This movie is an absolute STEAL for under $5 (most used DVD's of this title are under $5)"
1,This film stole 82 minutes from my life ...,"... and those are 82 minutes I will never get back. This movie is a rambling, badly acted and directed travesty. The fact that horror fans would like it is sad and depressing. It has no creativity and tries to do nothing remotely interesting with the zombie subgenre. I ZOMBIE, which is shot on video, made me think of the film SHATTER DEAD, which was also shot on video, and was able to do something different and interesting with its premise, whereas this film drags on and on and on and on. At least REDNECK ZOMBIES, another sov film, gave its audience gore despite the fact that it wasn't overflowing with originality."
1,"yeah it was original, but it sucked","I, Zombie was an original film, but it just doesnt work. It was very boring at times, didnt make sense, and was depressing.The only good thing about this movie were the special effects and the zombie makeup. Avoid this at costs, go watch Dawn of the Dead again instead..Unrated for Strong violence/Gore and Language"
4,A New Look At Zombies!!!,"Seen them all... All the zombie flicks... Romero is king... Fulci is awesome... Argento rules... I know what's good.This film was great! I read some of the other reviews before I purchased this film and almost passed it by. Other than this flick, I have seen and own every zombie and cannibal film available. This movie isn't scary. The gore factor isn't as you would expect for a zombie film... don't get me wrong, there's gore... That's not what this film is about. ""I, Zombie"" describes the process of actually turning into a zombie... how one becomes isolated from society and slowly decays (physically and MENTALLY). I love all the zombie films, but this one takes it to a different level. A MUST for zombie fans. If you want a really scary movie or a lot of gore, search elsewhere."
3,One good film,The George Strait movie proves that not all country singers can or should act. Honeysuckle Rose on the other hand is a fine film that is almost a tribute to Willie Nelson. I really enjoyed it and loved the music.
2,film-cd willie nelson,it' a shame cann't play the film-cd on my frenche system!so think it will be ok???..............maybe some one could tell me how to play this cd? in europe!thanksanyway the delivery was quik and save!
4,Country with heart and soul,Honeysuckle Rose is one of those surprising films that starts out with every cliche in the 'folk/country universe' and becomes a movie with considerable emotional depth and integrity. And the music is great.
2,DVD beware - US or overseas?,"This video cannot be shown on European DVD-players, only on US players. I would expect that my European address would tell your people what format to send me, or at least being given a choice of format when ordering. I now have the DVD I ordered, without being able to watch it."
1,Poor quality,"I guess you get what you pay for, but you can instantly tell the build quality is poor. The pin snapped on the tool before I could even really get to use it."
1,Is like a toy,"I used twice, and then broke! I really do not recomend this product. Is not a good product for watch fix!"
3,Very decent,"Another basic item which does not work well on every watch, but it was worth the money I paid, I'm satisfied"
1,Not sturdy and tip breaks easily.,Be careful when using this tool. Also putting the links back together with this tool is hard. I suggest looking for different options.
5,Simple kit...works!,This is a very simple kit to remove metal pin from wrist band. This stuff really works great! Thumbs up!
1,cheap junk,"this is a simple design that should work without any issue. The first time I tried to remove a watch pin the device broke. I replaced the pin and tried again with the same result. this was the ""cheapest"" similar device and I got what I paid for I guess. I would return it but the cost to mail is more than it is worth. I just threw it away."
2,incomplete,It works just fine with resizing.. but I didn't get the four extra bits with it !! I don't know why !
1,Garbage,"Had stress cracks in the plastic the first time i used it, very thin plastic , broke way too easy, look somewhere else for this type of tool."
3,OK,Make sure your wristband fits in it... I had to ... make the groove bigger with a knife... which was not pretty :(... but it does the job... I still dont know what the extra... pins are for
5,Works Like a Charm,"Even if you're not mechanically inclined, this tool is easy to use and well worth the few bucks it cost. I paid almost $20 to have an $80 watch resized awhile back. True, had I bought the watch in a store, they would've done it for free, but the $80 watch I bought on Amazon goes for almost $130 in brick and mortars.The unit doesn't come with instructions, but it's fairly simple to figure out. Each watch's pins move a bit differently, but that's easy to figure out as well. Then, just remove links, one at a time until the watch fits. Simple as that.The unit itself is plastic, the interchangeable pins (a variety of sizes) are metal and store in the base of the unit. Overall, everything seems well made.Well worth the money you'll save resizing just one watch."
3,"It worked, but feels very shoddy","I have to give this tool 3 stars because it got the job done, but I must say, this thing feels SUPER cheap. I wouldn't expect this to last through 3 more uses. If you're looking for something cheap just to remove a link from a new watch, this may do the trick, but it's by no means ""quality""."
3,make sure you know what kind of pins your watch band uses,"I bought this kit to remove a few links from a women's seiko 5 watch band. The seiko 5 uses ""L"" shaped pins. I could not find a way to use the link remover tool to remove these type of pins. I ended up being able to use a simple screwdriver from an eyeglass repair kit to get the pins out.."
1,JUNK,This tool is poorly made to the extreme. Nothing fits together. Handle is wobbly. The caps on the handle fall off. Even the included extra pins are of different size and do not fit in the tool. It is completely worthless even if it was given away for free.
1,didn't work for me,"No instructions. I don't believe it is possible to use on my Seiko watchband, since there are no holes in the outer edges of my band. Not sure it was new, since the side knob was chewed up as if someone had used pliers on it."
1,se watch band tool is garbage,"did a search for a INVICTA watch band tool and this came up....ive used amazon before so it must be a good tool....WRONG...first, ANY watch with a wide band doesnt fit in the tool.....then changed 2 sections of a band that did fit in the tool and bent 2 of the 5 push pins included in the kit.. and its not rocket science to use this tool....should of returned it...."
5,tool,"First time I used this tool, and I had the watch band adjusted in less than 5 minutes. Extremely pleased with results!"
1,Does not work!,It is a very cheap tool. First time to use it broke. At least I only payed less than $4 other way I old be very mad! Don't waste any money this tool doesn't work at all.
1,Poor Poor Quality,Made of cheap plastic and very poor worksmanship. The 5 extra pins weren't even included as advertised. The thing broke after 5 minutes of using it. The metal in the handle snapped off so it could not be used to push the pins out of the hinge on the watch band.Do not waste your time or money with this product. Spend the extra 10$ and have a professional do it the right way so you don't scratch your watch. It's really not worth the aggravation this product gives.
3,"probably wouldn't last long, but is perfect","If you have more than one watch to resize or if you change bands frequently, this tool makes it easy to do yourself without the hassle and expense of going to a jeweler. It probably wouldn't last long in commercial use, but is perfect at home."
4,Once I figured it out...,Once I figured out how to use it (no directions provided!) it worked fine. Much less money and time than taking my watch to a jeweler to have the band shortened.
2,Didn't work for me,"I have a Tag Heuer watch, Carrera model. The watch cost me a pretty penny but the cheapskate in me didn't want to pay Tourneau $25 to add one link to the band. Decided to give this a try because the price couldn't be beat. The item is exactly as described in the description and the other reviews...it's a piece of molded plastic with several, different sized metals tips. Not especially well made but I see how it could get the job done.So I lined up the watch, threaded the metal tip into the pin, and was able to push it about 1/4 out, but not any further. Something about the design of the metal tip...it wouldn't go any further. Maybe it's just the design of my watch. Even tried pulling the pin out with pliers, to no avail.Anyway, I ended up bringing it up to a Tag retailer, who adjusted it for free. Giving this product 2 stars because it looks like it could work for some people...just didn't work for me. For this price, it's worth a shot."
1,Terrible Product Really,"I read the reviews about this and thought, ""I can use this thing correctly,"" in spite of the negative reviews. Well, I couldn't. I was able to remove some links from a new watch, but couldn't finish the job because the little pins that come with this thing bent and broke. If it does work for you, as it has for some, it's pure luck. Find a better product or just pay a jeweler to do it for you for $15."
2,Not Good,this item is cheapky made and the pins that are used to extract (push out) the holding pin in watch - Bend and or Break very easily - I would not have bought this item should I have seen it 1st hand before purchase
4,Great little tool!,"Great little tool, very easy to use and gets the job done quickly. I had my watch (Invicta) sized in less than 15 minutes. I highly recommend this product."
3,I made it work,"the blue clamp thing, was too small for my watch bands width. The little pin pushers were all I really needed, and I used the plastic blue thing like a hammer. As has been said for this price it's not bad, unless you can find the pins by themselves for less or the same."
1,Delivered with a broken handle.,The tool may have been okay if it arrived in one piece. The handle was broken off so you are not able to use the screw in feature.For $3.25 its not worth my effort to send it back.Will try to find a metal tool instead.
3,Eh its ok,Its cheaply made but its was cheap to buy. Its sort of difficult to see if your hitting the pin or the metal of the watch. Still it did the job
5,Link Remover,"Cheaply made product, yet works like a charm. Already paid for itself in one use. Well worth the 3 dollars paid."
1,broken bit head on first try,"Within 5 minutes of opening the packaging, and setting up my watch for the link removal. The bit of the head broke off as if it were cheap metal. Like they say you get what you pay for. Never again!"
3,Works but not robust,Works. Have to be carefull using it. Not very sturdy.... but does the job.Also hope it came with varying size/lenght of pins.
4,Gets the job done,"I purchased this item for exactly what it's meant to do. Far to many times I get a watch fitted, only to find out later that it is not the optimal size for my wrist. This product may be cheaply made (i.e. the price could tell you that though) but for what I had planned on using it for it worked out great. If you rarely remove links but want to be able to do it yourself this is the item for you. It doesn't come with directions but a quick YouTube search will show you how it works (if you were unsure)."
3,The SE Watchband link removal kit is ok,This watchband remover tool works ok I guess but the mechanism that inserts into the pin of the watchband moves around quite a bit and consequently is not precise. I ended up inserting a spare pin using my fingers instead. But for $3 shipped who can really complain?
4,Expect one-time use,"For the price (I paid less than $4), it did the job. Don't expect a super-high quality tool that's going to last for many years, because that's not what you're buying. I was able to size my watch, but used all the extra pin pushers as they bend easily even if you're careful with the tool. Some watch pins are tighter than others, so your mileage may vary. My goal was to size my watch, and it worked for that. However it's basically a disposable tool. If you haven't attempted to size a watch before, and aren't good with tools, then I'd suggest you take your watch to a watch-shop or jeweler."
5,It's 3 dollars people...,"For 3 bucks what are you guys expecting? It did it's job and more than paid for itself. I sized 6 watches so far and have not broke a single pin. Just go slow and use some precision. I really don't see how this item could possibly get anything less than 4 stars at this price. If it does just ONE WATCH, it is worth it. I did have modify to work with my Nixon, but wasn't hard at all."
3,Cheap but bad quality,The tool is ok for what you pay (cheap) but the pins are garbage.I already broke 2 of them trying to remove the first link.
1,Cheap piece of junk!!,The tip broke and bent the first time I tried to use it. Without having the instructions on how to use it was a disappointment but even more so since I had NO idea on how the change the pins out!! The price a jewler charges it is well worth the hassle and frustration and LOSS of the money spent!!
3,Worked but probably a one time use.,1 bit broke and two bent. At least they sent enough bits to finish the job. Worked but not worth it in my opinion.
2,it works but one of the pieces already broke off!,I used this once and it definitely works. My only complaint is that one of the screws that it came with broke off : (
3,Got the job done,I bought it so my husband can remove some links from the watch I got him for Christmas.. It got the job done
3,It works,"Considering the low price, this tool worked pretty well. I was glad that the kit contained extra bits. Very Useful."
4,It got the job done.,"It cost about $5.00 at the store to adjust the links on a watch. This cost $3 and some change and did the job just fine. Had no problem adjusting my watch, easy peasy."
2,Not the best,"I am happy with cheap items that have simple uses. I bought this to adjust a women's Tag. The included pusher pins just weren't long enough. In short, it didn't work"
2,link pin remover,Arrived with a bent pin. Luckily others were not bent. Did not work on the watch I wanted it to. Worked on other watches. Typical design. Light weight plastic. Does not work smoothly. There is a catch in the swist of the handle. It doesn't interfer with operation but is annoying. Arrived quickly.
1,Not so good!!,Thirty years in the jewelry business doesn't help when working with plastic tools! First time I used this link remover it snapped in half...save your money and buy a metal one!!
1,Amazon lies about instock on this item,They said it was in stock and did not ship for seven days.SE Link Pin Remover for Bracelet Adjustment Watch Sizing
2,do not buy,"The slot is very narrow. I tried two female watches and two male watches. none of them can fit into the slot. I should return it. but it is cheap, no time to waste on it.The needles are useful, give it a two stars."
4,great buy,"great tool,easy to use, it can help you to save some money, only 4 stars due to its cheap pastic but no big deal, very satisfied."
1,Mine didn't come with the advertised extra 5 pins,"The pins break easily which is why I chose this one. But mine didn't come the extra 5 pins as shown, only 1. Yes, it was only $3.25, but I expect to receive what is shown. Returned to amazon for refund."
4,Good tool,"Taking my time, I got the watch band apart and together again with no difficulties. The tool functioned well and made it really easy to do."
1,"Returned, Replaced",This item arrived broken and was replaced the replacement was also broken. Very poorly packaged in a thin plastic bag that offered NO protection.
4,works great,The product works great and was reasonably priced. I have removed links in two watch bands and am very satisfied with the purchase.
2,not very plactical,This unit can only be used with certain narrow watchbands. I have several Invictas and I could not use it
3,bad quality,"it works very well and has a very chochmadike machinery, but the pins break or bend very easily and become inuseable. definitely worth buying one of higher quality."
2,watch band adjuster,I couldn't figure out how to use it. All one needs is a very small screwdriver. All one needs to say.
1,bad product,"poor quality did not even finish fixing few watches lenth, the tip is not strong , it bend after the first time using it."
3,average,"average. able to figure it out without a video. i need to keep writing to submit this review, even tho they asked me to write it!!"
3,Just go to a jeweler.,"It was difficult to align the pins on the band with the tool's pin, and I would not call it easy to use.I am not an ""un-handy"" person, but I struggled with it for about thirty minutes. Neither the tool itself nor the watch, came with directions of how to best use the tool. I became frustrated, and was afraid of scratching the metal band on my new watch,so I wound up going to a jeweler. He did the job in less than 5 minutes."
5,"Price was right, especially with extra pins.","I purchase a lot of watches and the price was right, especially with the extra pins, just what I needed. Would definitely recommend."
2,Not good,"I saw mixed reviews on this before buying, but it looked exactly like one I saw someone use in a department store, so I thought it'd be OK for under $10 shipped. I wish I'd gotten something else.Two major problems1) Today's thicker (men's) watchbands will just barely fit into the slot. (Note to reseller: more product info would help here.) But then you can't see the alignment of the pin remover with where it makes contact with the pin on the watch. I broke a few pins on the remover just trying to line things up.2) Just as important, the pin on the remover wobbles as you screw it in toward the watch band. (It's VERY loose.) It's like trying to twist a corkscrew, into a narrow space in which you can't see, and have the point on the corkscrew hit the head of a pin dead on. If you're off, the remover-pin will snap ... which mine did repeatedly.Don't bother with this product."
1,broke first time i tried to use it,"First I discovered that my watch was too thin for the tool to work. There is a screw that moves the platform up and down, but the highest setting was too low. I compensated by putting a piece of cardboard under the watch band and it lined up perfectly. As I tried to remove the pin (and it started to come out), the entire link remover broke in half. This tool was a waste of money!!!!"
5,worked perfectly,I removed two links in say less than 3 minutes. Don't you ever pay to remove your watch links again. Get this tool instead. It worked.
4,Needs some modifications for Invicta Watches,"I boought this to remove links from one of the large Invicta Watches. You can just use the punch tool, or use some needle nose pliers to break the tray so the large bands will fit in the slots. I just used the punch tool to push the pins out without using the tray the first time. Afterwards, I broke the tray sides out to accomodate a large watch band for future use."
4,Works fine,"Worked fine. If I was going to use it more, I'd want something better, but it removed the pins on my Invicta, and ESQ watches with no problems. Came fast with the extra 15 cents shipping from hobbytoolsupply thru the other sellers link."
4,Adequate,"This product works well. No extras, and you'll also need a pair of pliers, but it serves the purpose."
2,You get what you pay for.,Did not work as easily as described. I have broken two of the pins trying to get the watch pin out. Still have not been able to remove the watch pins.
2,Meh.,"I got this tool thinking that my life removing watch links would be easy and pain free. Sadly, this was not so. Although my order did ship in time, the tool barely worked. I needed something that would push the watch pins all the way out. This cheap plastic contraption only pushed the links out a third of the way, then I had to struggle with my bare hands and TEETH to pull the rest of the pin out. Which, by the way was unsuccessful. Due to the fact that I'm at college, and don't have access to tools meant, that I had to use a PAPER CLIP to jimmy the rest of the pins out of my watch. Needless to say, I was disappointed."
1,Did not work,"I was unable to get the tool to work. It ended up breaking, and I had to take the watch to a jeweler. Disappointing."
1,Need printed instructions.,I cannot figure out how to use this tool. Printed instructions would be very helpful since the on-line version seems to show a different design.
1,"Sure, it's cheap.. but not worth it!!","I thought it would work quite well since most people seem to have had luck with it and it DID work but with extremely excruciating slowness since the tool that I received was wobbly and all the pieces were of incredibly mediocre quality. It really isn't worth more than $2 in my opinion. Definitely would NOT buy again, it works but if you're going to be using it more than once (which is what I was hoping to do) then you should save yourself the trouble and buy something nicer for a few bucks more.Not worth it and I would give it zero stars but that's not a possibility with Amazon's rating system."
4,gets the job done,"Considering most jewelers charge $10-$20 to adjust a watch, this is a great buy. Yes, it is not the highest quality piece of equipment out there but it costs around $3. I have used this to resize my new watch and I am happy with the results. It pays for itself in one use!Note: I saw a few reviews saying that the plastic handle ""snapped"". The handle will come out if you unscrew it all the way (which is actually beneficial because I used the handle by itself to push in spring bars)... you can just screw it back on."
3,Watchband link remover,This tool has worked well on my wife's watch. I have been able to take the links apart several times quite easily. The tool pushes the pins connecting the links out no problem and it is very simple to use. The only problem is that the gap the pin is forced out into is a little wide and you have to hold the watch band very carefully if you are trying to get the last link on the band off. If you are not really careful the band can twist off center and bend the punch that is pressing the pin out.
1,Do not buy. Cheap and poorly made.,"Do not buy this. First off, it is too narrow for most new men's watch bands. (I was using it for a new men's fossil watch.) I had to ghetto-rig it to get it to lie flat. Secondly, the pin pushers are very cheap and poorly made. I broke all of them within a few minutes and never succeeded in getting one pin fully out. I got one pin partially out before all the tips bent or completely broke off. Save your money and get a better one."
4,Great Tool Was a little too narrow though,"This tool does what it's supposed to do. Unfortunately, the wedge was a about 4 cm too narrow for my watch. As a result, I had to rig it to pop one of my pins out. As a result, I shot the pin through my thumb and left a good puncture wound.If you're working with smaller size bands, this tool would be fine. If you have a wider than usual sized band, I'd look elsewhere for an adjustable width wedge."
1,Too flimsy to do the job.,"When the SE Watchband Link Remover Tool arrived, I found that one of the plastic rings securing the end of the plunger was missing, so it fell apart when I tried to use it. I taped it closed (thank goodness for duct tape) then tried to press out a watch band link pin. The plunger pin bent and broke. I installed another with the same result.This tool is so poorly designed and made, I cannot understand how ANYONE could successfully use it!"
4,"Very cheap quality, but works just fine.","This item is EXTREMELY cheap quality. The product I received had very pronounced seams from the injection molding to make the part. One was so sharp, I used a knife to shave it down to make it more comfortable.That being said, the product still functions and operates fine. I've used it multiple times to remove links from my watches, and I really have no other complaints besides the quality. It works fine, and comes with a little baggie of replacement pin tips that you're more likely to lose than you are to run out.For 3 bucks, if you get even one use out of it, it's worth your time, so you might as well give it a try."
4,Works as advertised.,The only improvement I would like to see for this price is that it be a little wider. One of my watch bands did not fit in the area allowed. The plastic is cheap but it seems to be lasting for me.
4,Watchband Link Remover Tool,The Watchband Link Remover does the job that it is designed to do very well.You cannot beat it for the price paid and I am sure you will be pleased with]your purchase.
3,Worked on my cheap Target watch,I bought a cheap watch that I didn't care about but still wanted it to fit.At the mall a few stores wanted 10$ per link removed!?So I got this funny thing and it works like you would expect.Those metal things break but they include a bunch of them so don't plan to have it for life.
3,Harder than it looks,"The way to use this is pretty strait forward, but its still kind of tricky. I'm not sure what the screw on the side was supposed to adjust, as the instructions were vague and brief. Bits are not long enough to take the pin completely out, and I had to use pliers, which slightly bent one pin even when being very careful. Fortunately, this this was really inexpensive, so you get what you pay for."
1,you get what you pay for,"It's way smaller than it seems on pictures here. My metal band on my 50mm did not fit. This made me very upset. I don't have time to go through the trouble of sending the item back, if I did I would have. I don't recall reading in the item description the max band width. The intructions are weak. I don't even know what that screw on the side is for. oh well."
2,A disappointment,"The pins are very slender and fragile, and to line this tool up so that the pin does its job without bending takes surgical precision. I wound up just using the slot in the block to hold the watchband vertically, and then tapped the pin with a small hammer. Much more effective."
1,Avoid this!!,"I broke two pins without even trying!! Bought another brand that was only a few dollars more and it worked beautifully. You pays your money and makes your choices, but this is a bad choice!"
5,SO easy!!!!,"For only like $4 you can't beat it! You pay that or more just to get links removed. And that's each time. I'll be using this for every watch I buy. And I know some were saying they didn't get 5 extra pins, but I did!"
3,"Cheap, Doesn't Work Very Well",The reason why it's so cheap is because it is made cheaply. I went through 4 screws just to get pins out of a watch. Be very careful when you use it or you will go through all the screws that come with the machine. They are VERY fragile.
5,Works well,Works as described and makes quick work out of sizing stainless link watch bands-way less than a visit to the watch shop.
2,It does the job but...,I used it today and it broke after a few turns I guess for the price.. the quality is expected to be poor.
1,Piece of chinese junk!,"Don.t waste your time and the few dollars it costs. You know that old saying, ""You get what you pay for""? Well thats the case with this item. It was shipped to me directly from China, that's why it took 14 days to get to me. Your better off getting a small but strong needle and put it in a vise. This way you can push the band pin out. Luckily, this item was only a few bucks so it didn't break the bank."
4,DVD-Rom Drive 8x Travelerpccard Portable with Mpeg2 Sw,"This drive is an excellent drive while working with IBM Laptops but choppy or unrecognized by Toshiba Laptops due to agreement issue between EXP and Toshiba so far as I contacted with EXP Technical Support and they had explained to me as I described above. In general, this unit will work well with IBM laptops and may other brands but not with Toshiba Laptop latest Models."
1,Archos style DVD-rom,"I bought an Archos DVD rom drive (PCMCIA - 32bit pccardbus) recently explicitly for watching dvds on my laptop 566Mhz,160Mb Ram, 4Mb Graphics card. Although my laptop was far and above the specifications required and displayed on the box, the quality of the product left a lot to be desired. The sound quality was aweful! The drive would only play european dvd's. (I bought it in New York for god's sake!).I would not reccomend that product to anyone. I'm not sure if certain companies are re-selling this product under their own badges, but for your own sanity, please contact the company directly and find out! (or look at their web-site)."
2,Douped,This product was listed on Amazon as brand new & it was not; you could tell it was used due to the scratch marks in the leather.
2,Cheaply made,Purchased these chairs to go along with a table I recently refinished. They are very cheaply made. Held together by only 6 small bolts. When you sit in them they feel like they are going to fall apart. Very unhappy and not worth it. I doubt they'll last a year before one breaks.
2,very poor quality,"These chairs are such poor quality I don't think I will ever let anyone actually sit on them, I am afraid that they will colapse and dump them onto the floor. It is too much trouble to return them so I will just set them aside or throw them away."
2,Strathwood stackable chair,"Look good but are not sturdy -they wobble. I had to brace the back and bottom to beef up, luckly using outdoors so am not too fussy. Not a good value."
1,Bad design,"I bought these chairs in Q4 2010. The design is flawed and there is no way to assemble these chairs w/o the chair being unstable.I would not recommending getting these chair. They are cheap, look good but what good is that if the chair wobbles. I even tried glueing the back to the front but even that did not help. Should have listened to other reviews on this chair."
2,"same story, different names","I don't know if anyone has noticed but these books are the same plot with different generations and Kings/Queens. I finished this book, but am sorry to say that I am done with this Dynasty. Stick with Morris' more original plots and love stories, I started the fourth and put it down. Way to much historical depth and no real desire to see the characters flourish, sorry to say."
2,"Poor plot and re-occurring, tiresome, scenarios","I've read three of the seven Wakefield Dynasty books. Yes, they do have a tendency to repeat the same scenes over with new charachters. I would highly recommend ""THE SWORD OF TRUTH"" (Wakefield Dynasty #1), but after the second book the re-occurring plots and scenes get old. I do have to admit though that I have definetly have gotten my English history out of them!"
5,I needed 7 copies,"I bought seven copies of this for my seven adult children. It is a delightfully illustrated, simple and beautiful children's book about the unique gifts that children have in their parents' eyes. My wife and I plan to write individual inscriptions and present them to our children to read to their children."
5,Have Three Children? You Need This Book!,"I have three children, and when my third boy was born, I received this book as a present. I think my two other boys loved hearing the story of how a mom and dad can love their babies all the same even if there are many of them. It is just an adorable book!"
5,Step Right This Way,"I bought this book for myself. My relatives owned a circus during the late 1890's and early 1900's and I thought it would be an interesting book to add to my collection of circus books. I found out about it from a trailer on the movie ""Water for Elephants"". I have enjoyed reading it and looking at the various pictures. Thank you for being a stepping stone to finding books like this."
5,"I loved it, my brother hated it.(Why?!)","I remember this, though I wasn't a ""child"" I was a HS freshman or something, but I still loved it.(It is better than Cowboy B. S. which is clownish) The dialogue is kiddish, but it is to be ignored for the excellent stories and those odd-sounding cars which I told my Dad were ""rotary engines"". My bro thought it was a Star Wars rip-off Jayce(or ""Jace"" as I misspelled in my own commic books I wrote about him for fun) winned like Skywalker about his father and sounded like a ninie. The Herc Character(yes Han Soloesque so sue me!) was my favorite and had more personality than the others in this series. The guys were witty and the girls were pretty, what more could you want? Better than the PC bull-- out now. I am not a fan of Aname but liked this and the Thunder Cats as well as the Hobbit(yes it was anime too.)"
3,Ok,I ordered this item thinking that it would give me a close cut. It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. What I do like about it is that it's smaller and easier to handle than my bigger one.
1,Wrong product for Canon camera,"I purchased the SDHC for a new Canon camera, not knowing that it will not work with a Canon 750.There was no compatibility chart for this product."
4,"OEM part, good performance","I can't tell how old this battery is, but it seems to perform well--I'm getting 1hr 45min runtime on my T30. ACPI sensors report 46.4Wh remaining capacity at full charge."
5,BuckWear T Shirts for women,"I bought this for my granddaughter, she was very pleased. I will order again.ThanksAnn"
2,Colorized Black Dragons.,"No movie with Bela Lugosi in it can be a total bore, but this one comes too close. It deals with a Nazi doctor performing surgery on Japanese spies to make them pass as Americans. This is done to ease their schemes at sabotaging our war effort. It is a cheap movie, a slow movie, but would not even suffer too much for these flaws if it did not also rely on a long and awkward flashback sequence near the end, snuffing out what suspense had been built. The quality of the tape is not bad, but either you like colorized movies or you don't. This reviewer does not. Die-hard Lugosi fans (are there any other kind?) may want to purchase Black Dragons, but others will find it too ... ehh."
1,EASILY LUGOSI'S WORST FILM,"Made directly after the Japanese assault on Pearl Harbor in World War II, This film is ridiculous. Lugosi is a plastic surgeon who transforms some Japanese businessmen into American fifth columnists who set about trying to destroy America's war effort from the inside. The film is poorly constructed and Lugosi looks bored. This film is an insult to his talent."
2,"perfectly awful, though Lugosi rises above all others","This is a war spy film about a group of Japanese men placed in the US as a fifth column, taking the place of businessmen. I was intrigued by it because it sounds like ""the hundred days of the dragon"" that was an early Outer Limits episode. Unfortunately, the film has simply terrible acting, with the exception of the mysterious mastermind as played by Lugosi. The men are like sleeper agents, waiting to be activiated by hypnotism. It comes off as both unbelievable and unbearably slow, with wooden dialogue and the crudest stereotypes of ""the enemy"" that one can imagine.Not recommended."
2,For Lugosi fans only... and only if it's on TV,"Do not waste your money on this movie. I like Bela Lugosi, but so far, I have only seen about twelve of his movies. However, this is probably the worst of those. Lugosi is good, as usual. Some of the other actors are decent and some are not so good. The weakest part of the movie is the story. It's not interesting or thrilling (it's supposed to be a horror-thriller). It's just boring.Don't waste your money on this. If you're a Lugosi fan, watch it if it's ever on TV. ""Invisible Ghost"" and ""Devil Bat"" are better"
2,not quite a klunker but not what I hoped for,I was hoping klunkerz would be for mt biking what dogtown and the z boys was to skateboarding. Reflective on the california history of the sport with something for folks that were elsewhere doing the same or even not involved in the sport. Unfortunately Klunkerz came out more like a home movie for Gary Fisher and friends. I enjoyed the riding scenes and some of the interviews but ultimately was left wanting to know more on the secondary players and a little drama to keep it lively. For a movie from an area known for its music I was suprised it didnt have a stronger soundtrack.
5,A Must-See for those who love the sport,"This is a wonderful film that captures the culture and personalities that engendered the sport. It does a great job of presenting the grit and verve of the various individuals and factions that created the sport. Even if you think you know what went into the birth of mountain biking in Marin, I guarantee you'll come away with a deeper, fresh understanding of the people and technologies that gave birth the sport."
5,Beautiful History,"This is an excellent story about the first people to find ways to ride bikes on mountains, long before the purpose built instruments of today. It chronicles the ideas, rituals, and progress through the people that were there. Everyone who enjoys dirt at human powered speed should see this to know the personalities and lifestyle that created it."
5,A Must-See for Mountain bikers,"Having been a long-time Mountain biker, and having grown up in Marin County in the 1970's, I had to see Klunkerz. Although I'm younger than the Fairfax gang, Ritchie, Fisher, etc., I remember seeing some of Joe Breeze's early bikes around Mill Valley while in High School.Billy Savage has chronicled the early days quite well; it goes along with what I knew from being on the periphery. The footage from the original Repack races is amazing, and it's refreshing hearing the Marin guys giving much credit to the South Bay guys for some innovations.If you've ever wondered where it all started, or even why they're called ""Mountain"" bikes, then you need to see Klunkerz."
4,Good coverage of early Moutain biking!,"Very informative on the birth of mountain biking. Gives you a good feel about how things were, and some of where they came, or are now! Just a real fun flick!"
4,Life as a Scottish Covenanter,"This is a great story set during the persecutions of the Scottish Covenanters. Daily life and survival is depicted and sermons are related. As people are tortured and killed, the Black Avenger arises, and comes to the rescue of some of them. A master of disguises, nobody knows who he is, even his sweetheart... for a while. He never engages in acts of cruelty or revenge, but tries only to rescue and protect, although that necessarily involves hurt to the wicked at times. This book of church history is full of danger, adventure, and at all times, no matter the cost, a beautiful trust in God.I highly recommend this one for children, adults, and families."
