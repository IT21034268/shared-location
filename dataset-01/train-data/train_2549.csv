2,"the ""pimp with the heart of gold""","Hustle and Flow is a commercially successful independent film, and writer-director Craig Brewer is to be congratulated on that basis alone. But that nagging feeling I had leaving the theater was the uncomfortable parallel between Brewer himself and his lead character DJay. In much the same manner that DJay shamelessly exploits the women around him, Brewer exploits DJay's seedy Memphis underworld of drugs, guns, rap, pimping and prison to create this strangely audience-pleasing concoction. DJay, unfortunately, is no one to be admired. Would that Brewer had turned his many talents toward subject matter that we could find uplifting without resorting to the cliché of the ""pimp with the heart of gold""."
1,There are few films really bad. This one is.,Waste of time and total waste of money. Made for the narrow group of community college educated hard-core Jerry Springer Show fans.The less than college-educated Jerry's fans will miss the refined subtleties of hoin'-n-pimpin' with hip-hoppin' and - for the lack of any action beside pimps cursin' and babies cryin' - be bored to death within 5 minutes.Highly NOT recommended.
5,Hustle!!!!,"I remember when I first saw this, I wasn't too impressed but I rewatched it. This is a great film, the main character is a pimp but he's trying to make music. Great preformance from Terrance Howard. The soundtrack was awesome. It's Sensational"
4,"Memphis, Baby","Memphis has had her poets, oh yes, think of Elvis, Tennessee Williams, Peter Taylor, William Faulkner, but now because there is a God after all, Memphis is to be immortalized on film. This is a sweet tale of striving, that classic American theme, a guy who wants to make good in a cruelly indifferent world. Oh how glorious is the confrontation in the toilet between the nobody (Terrence Howard), who wants to make it, and the somebody (Ludacris), who doesn't care. Isn't that epic? The film captures the beauty of Memphis ugliness, that odd desolation that has inspired so much artistic beauty. The soundtrack is fantastic, the acting pitch perfect, the setting magical. One wishes the best to the director."
2,Still not sure if people who like it are serious...,"I know ""if you can't say something nice..."" I enjoyed it, but - and I almost feel bad saying it, because of the critical and popular success ""Hustle and Flow"" has enjoyed - in a ""Show Girls"" kinda way. I think ""cartoonish"" is the best adjective I can come up with. ""Corny"" is about right... I know a lot of people, whose opinions I respect, who like this movie - and I did find it entertaining - but I'd be really surprised to see anyone defending it a few years down the line. The story, dialogue, acting: all pretty silly, but it is an entertaining ""party movie"" (once you realize that it's a cartoon). My advice is to expect some light-hearted laughs (and maybe that was my misstep, expecting to take this movie seriously.) Sorry to be mean, but I think the money's been made, etc. Disclaimer: I don't get a few things that everyone seems to dig, like the band REM, for example."
3,"Pimps,Ho's,Jail and they still manage to make a record.","Terrance Howard and Anthony Anderson, D.J. Qualls some marijuana,some God, then along comes Ludacris ansome ho's and somehow someone makes a CD,and goes to jail, but he's Happy."
1,This movie was a hustle,"Terrence Howard is a great actor and for him to be in a movie this dumb is reeks of the same desperation to stay relevant that Cuba Gooding Jr had when he played the godawful Boat Trip. Terrence Howard plays D'Jay, a pimp who tries to get into the rap business. The movie is dull and you can tell that Terrance did not want to be there by looking at how bland his performance is. His songs are dull and painful to listen to and the fact that they were even nominated for an award is a good reason not not take award shows serious. I mean Its Hard Out Here For A Pimp is a straight garbage and any sane person can tell you that ""D'Jay"" cant flow for diddly squat. Despite the glowing reviews for this movie, it was a pretty tedious and lame affair. And the soundtrack that accompanies the movie is just as bad as the movie itself. Two thumbs WAY down for this minstrel theater disasterpiece."
3,Could have done better with the plot,"I really wanted to like the movie more. It was gutsy and Terrance Howard gave a convinceable performance as a hard nose pimp to a wanna be rapper, the start of the film is slow and leaves the viewer just wanting to know a little more indept of the charcters."
1,A Gangsta Garbage Movie,"""Pimpin', hoes and rappin' be fun"". What a piece of garbage this was. This movie will definitely inspire future inmates of America. No wonder the ghetto mentality still exists."
2,mediocre,"Terence Howard stars as a pimp that's looking to ""better"" his life by making in big in rap music.A mediocre film that further pushes the stereotype of black people and it's a poor attempt to draw pity toward people that spend their lives making excuses for the dirty deeds they do. NOBODY is forced to be a pimp. Sorry. Go get a job even if it's at the store. Atleast you would have some dignity then.Pimps have NO DIGNITY. What's shocking is there's women that condone this movie and what it contains. But hey, we live in a sick world now so who can be surprised.2/5"
2,Yes I know....,"Yes I know that with this kind of material, pimp, drugs etc. that this movie was not going to be June Cleaverish...but come on...this movie is one of the most vulgar attempts at a pimps life in the hood. I think that the acting was subpar for everyone involved, and I was utterly appalled at the fact that every other word was ""F____"" or M____F____. The list could go on and on. There are so many more movies out there that really do deserve accolades...this is not one of them. Definately NOT for kids..even for those that the parents think are ""mature"". Yes it has an R rating, but you would be surprised how many people rent these kinds of movies for their say 12 year olds...not this parent...pass on this movie altogether. :("
4,Hustle & Flow,"Since moving to Memphis in 2009, I've come to learn alot about the music, from old to new. This movie has a good story and gives an accurate portrayal of what it's like in Memphis, TN."
5,"Great movie, a must have for anyone interested in hip-hop culture","I'm going to say it... Hustle & Flow is one of the best movies that has been released in the past decade. Not for kids, you see drugs, prostitution, fighting, and the language is where you would expect it to be. But the movie won an academy award for a reason. If you haven't seen this one, give it a shot!"
5,Sonny is brilliant. Always.,"Maybe it's not up to the level of ""Saxophone Colossus"" or ""The Bridge,"" (then again, maybe it IS) but it's still wonderful music with more inspired, meaningful playing than you'll hear in 99% of other recordings by other people. And Jack DeJonette is a streamlined locomotive with so much momentum. And this is a wonderful recording. How anyone puts this recording down at all is beyond me. Yes, there's electric bass; but it is beautiful here. Give it all a chance. I love it."
1,Clover's purchase of Org Behavior by Hai,"I specifically thought I was buying a later edition (i.e., the latest) but got the orginal paperback dated 1986. Am very frustrated that this is one of the great difficulties in buying from Amazon or it's partners (knowing what edition you are going to get). I have recognized this difficulty prior but through the years thought I have learned how to either NOT buy or know what edition I was getting. This time I was completely fooled. This experience has reminded me to once again be completely wary of editions when buying from Amazon or don't buy. Bill Clover"
4,"Works Well, Minus The Staying-On-The-Flash Bit.","The price is fine, it arrived VERY quickly, but: it's not a snug fit for the flash. Fell off every time I moved my camera. I solved this by putting a rubber band around the head of the flash and wedging the diffuser on. Works like a charm now."
2,Meh... Its ok,"Yes it fits on my Olympus FL-36, but it will slowly work its way off unless you cram it on and its still not a great fit. Its pretty cheap and works ok, though I would recommend you look for another one and spend a few extra bucks. You have an expensive SLR and a flash, another few dollars wont kill you. make sure you buy equally high quality (but often pretty cheap here on Amazon) accessories for your expensive camera."
2,Doesn't fit,"I wish I would have read the reviews first. This diffuser doesn't really fit snugly on the SB 600. I will keep since it will probably cost more to return it, but I will be looking for another one."
4,Yoga Zone: Intro to Power Yoga,"This is one of my favorite yoga tapes. It has as strong athletic component, but it's fairly slow moving, so it kind of sneaks up on you how hard you are working. Appropriate for advanced to novice. Helps to tone muscles significantly, also noteworthy for flexibility. When you're done you feel worked yet balanced. After having done it a few hundred times the instructor's voice is only slightly annoying."
3,Boooring!,"Well, the picture in the front of this DVD looks like it will be a fun course, but is just the opposite. William does not smile once during the whole thing, not mentioning any motivation, like ""look, we are about to have fun"". Another major drawback - the DVD quality is like these guys just transferred the VHS content to DVD. It is so bad, that it is sometimes impossible to see finger positions, not even mentioning tablature - it is just blurred.Other than that, DVD teaches all the basic techniques, giving some examples (do not expect any famous songs, just some creations by the authors). I would strongly consider spending $15 more and geting the DVD with real songs and more fun host :-)"
2,It was BLUE,"The NIV study Bible itself is an excellent one, however I was really surprised to receive a navy blue Bible with silver leaf pages. I really wanted it to be black with gold leaf pages. I re-read the listing and contacted Amazon who informed me that they did not have it in black. I returned it."
4,Old fav,"Adam's Woman is one of my fond memories from many years past. I have always remembered seeing the movie in the 70's when they used to have the late show on TV, because home video and on-demand was unheard of then. I've done random searchs from time to time hoping to find a copy, and was happy to finally see it available on Amazon. The movie itself was not quite the epic experience I thought I remembered, and the DVD quality is so-so, but still a great story and very good movie. I'm quite happy that I bought this movie."
4,old movie,I dont know why I like this movie but I so it long ago and want to see it again . I like it still but I have alway felt that there are some missing parts . It still good .
5,silliness ensues!,"great veggie tale show. A must for all silly song lovers! It's a live stage show, but it holds up well as a DVD."
4,stand tall,"this book was about a 12 year old boy who is really tall . He faces many challenges like his parents live in seprate houses , his grandpa was in the war and got shot in the leg and now has to get it taken off also before tree (the main charater) knows it he is stuck in the school gym because there is a flood coming. Tree knows he has to be brave and he shows it when his dog,bradly,because pets wern't aloud inside tree makes a pin in the cellar and fills it with all types of pets icludeing his friends pet iguana . After the storm they clean up the house and the whole town has a celebration for all of the people who served in the war and for no one dieing ."
4,Stand Tall Review,"Stand Tall is a great book about a kid named Tree. Through this book you learn about Tree. His grandpa got his leg shot in a war and got it amputated. Tree helps him through the book and his grandpa helps him. Something bad happens in one of the towns Tree lives in. He lives in 2 towns because his parents just got divorced. He has a hard time with it and you learn how he handles it. Tree does a great thing when the bad thing happens and the whole town thanks him. I rate this book 4 stars because of the great lesson he learns about his height, because he is so tall and he is still growing. Thats why people call him Tree. I think that almost anyone should learn the lessons that are in this book."
3,Stand Tall,Stand Tall is an OK book. I enjoyed it because it was about an ordinary boy who was six feet tall and was made fun of. Tree had grade problems too. He had a grandpa who was in the hospital because he had left his football on the floor and his grandpa tripped over it. His mom and dad had left and he was very sad. About a day later he found his mother's purse that she left which made his life even more miserable. After a few years his mom came back and his dad was furious and he left. He was sad because all he wanted was both parents home and his grandpa out of the hospital.
1,Do NOT buy the audio version!,"This may be a good book, but it is impossible to tell from listening to the audio tapes--the worst narration I've ever heard. Mr. Mclarty's nasal, nasty monotone flattens descriptions, dialogue and characters' personalities into one long, l-o-n-g whiny earache. It appears for all the world to be his first-ever reading of the book, and a sloppy one at that (couldn't he read even a sentence ahead?): where the author helpfully supplies adverbs to indicate tone, this narrator completely ignores them, plowing and plodding ahead using the same annoying drone for every character and situation. All three of my kids--8, 10 and 12--were interested in the plot to begin with, but by now any game effort to finish the tape results in unanimous exclamations over the misery of trying to endure this narrative dentist's-drill."
3,not to bad,"this is a simple movie. a real change of pace, but nothin to bring out a 'WOW'.Its ok if your just totally bored."
1,Do not purchase this overpriced and terrible piece of meat.,"This was the worst lamb I have ever had. It was a very tough and fatty piece of meat.I have ordered and purchased lamb hundreds of times and this was by far the worst. I am so disappointed and upset by this.It ruined our holiday because we were all so excited about have this leg of lamb and it was so tough and fatty, that no one wanted to eat it. I threw 95% of it out.I will NEVER order from this company again.Don't waste your money."
5,Meat Head,"Delicious! Received chilled and was perfect for my Christmas dinner. Tender and juicy, it was perfect. Would purchase this again."
5,Keep your burners clean,"I rent a house and my landlord recently replaced my very old and ugly electric stove. The new one is nothing fancy, simple white stove with four standard electric burners, but it is new and clean and so much better than the old one. I got the urge to keep it looking good and figured, being lazy, the best way was to prevent it from getting dirty in the first place by buying burner covers. I chose these particular covers because of their simplicity of design. When they arrived (in two days thanks to Prime)I positioned them on the stove and realized then that I had made an excellent choice. Not only did they fit as advertised but they looked great on top of the white stove, brightening it's appearance without distracting colors."
5,Love thisCD,"Great CD. So much fun, I've bought many copies for friends, who always want one when they hear it. I bought the Putumayo World party CD and didn't like it nearly as much."
1,THe author is a marxist,Avoid this book like the plague. Socialism is fundamentally flawed and so is this book.
3,An unusual reaad,"This book by Flook is a very unusual one. Perhaps all of her novels are written this way. It involves two main characters, who are very flawed but whom one tries to enter into a relationship with the other. They both have pasts that play a part in the completion of the novel. If you want a novel that wraps up all the pieces in a nice bow you will not find it here. The characters are flawed and remain that way. I did enjoy the book.J. Robert Ewbank author ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'"""
2,Not that impressed,I found this border to be difficult to hang. I followed the instructions and the border was too heavy to adhere to the wall. I had to send my husband out to get paste from Lowe's just so that we could get it hung. A little disappointed as it was promised to be self-adhesive and easy to use.
4,Teddy bear wishes border,"As a first time user of borders & wallpaper, this is not a one person task. Instuctions OK, but because they don't tell you it is best to get a second person following the instructions maybe difficult. When the border is wet for the ten second and applied to the wall, it is too loose and has a tendency to slide. Because the border expands when wet, you want to do one complete section. This does not work for a loner. It's best to just get help."
2,unhappy customer,"We had ordered 2 rolls of the wall border on 2 different orders because it did not give us the length of the border on the site we ordered it from so we weren't sure how many we would need. When we went to put them on the wall, they were different widths. So we were not happy with this product."
3,A powerful stride...A dull recording,"Up-tempo fingers flying everywhere. Why is the effect so bland? Huge audience, (in tuxedos?) Applause that lingers far too long, ? engineers drowsy? loved the organ pieces, though. Perhaps it's just that solid stride for one hour is hard listening."
3,a museum piece.,"Sorry, but I have to disagree with the first review. This collection has none of the fire and vibrancy of the early stride piano artists. This is music to listen to while doing something else."
1,Only for...,"This gas cap is for a screw-on space only. most models 1995 and up wont work with this cap. Even if it does work, i could open the cap with any of my house keys making it a not so locking cap."
3,Of historical interest,"I was a huge fan of Antonioni's later works so I watched this with interest. It's a film noir, set in the late 40's probably, in post war Milan. As with other Antonioni films, the actors are very beautiful but they do very unbeautiful things. In the case of the woman she does them in very beautiful clothes in beautiful homes. I found it interesting to watch from an historical point of view but I can't say that I enjoyed it. Serious film students will probaly find a lot here. For the average viewer, even if you love many French and Italian films, this one may disappoint."
5,Can Nancy keep her friends together?,"Nancy, Bess and George are eight years old! Could there be a mystery to solve in third grade? When a locket goes missing belonging to one of Nancy's circle, the girls stop talking to each other. It looks like they'll never be freinds again ... unless that locket can be found!To make the mystery even stranger, it looks like whoever stole the locket left behind a weird sandwhich with peanut butter, relish, ketchup... a mushy mess to turn anyone's stomach!Nancy comes to the rescue, notebook in hand, analyzing every detail of the case. Young readers will enjoy solving the mystery along with their favorite detective. Certainly, they will be stimulated to read more about her adventures!Here's another winner from Carolyn Keene! Recommended!"
5,Wonderful Nancy Strikes again!,"This book is about a girl named George who is watching her cousin Bess's favorite locket. But when Bess looks for her locket, it's gone! Even though George claims she didn't take the locket, Bess wiil not talk to George and, after a while, George stops trying to talk to Bess. Can Nancy find the locket and grow back Bess and George's friendship before it's too late? Read the book to find out!"
4,Simple Qigong,Simple and easy to follow. I have found it is good to practice with tape for a while and then review occasionally to fine tune practice.
4,A great resource,"This book is a great resource for those people who are interested in selling their own photos. It is well written and researched by a professional photographer who writes from his own personal experience. The advice he gives is straight-forward and honest, and he even will share a few ""don'ts"". I recommend this book to anyone who is thinking of turning professional themselves."
3,Something is missing,"After finding the book downplaying the significance of digital in an early chapter, I looked at the publication date of 2003. I was fearful it might be outdated, but found, for the most part, it wasn't. Mr. Zuckerman hit all of the areas that I thought would be important for someone like myself wondering if I should be trying to sell some of my photos. There seems to a lot of good information for a beginner like myself and I think most of his photographs are spectacular. However, I can't say that I feel any more confident about trying to sell my work after reading it. I feel something or things are missing from the book. Unfortunately, I don't know what they are. Of course, if I did, I'd most likely be trying to write the book."
5,Photography book,This is an excellent book for anyone who wants to know how to make money with your Photography. The Author gives some very good ideas that doesn't cost alot of money to get started. I would recommend this book very much.
3,A little light..,A little dissapointed in this title. Photo's are of average quality and the information provided is no where near as good as other titles on this subject. When you see photography like this its hard to get inspired about the text provided also.
4,A brand new world with a whole bunch of adventure,"Josh Adams is happy then he grows(wish I could do that)he's tall and uncomfortable then Sarah comes pretty and small. One night his father wakes him upand tells him a nuclear war has just started. They leave with Sarah and Josh's mom. At the silo Mr.Adams tells him about a secret project-Sleepers. Josh is loaded into one. After what seems like a moment-but is actually fifty years later!- Josh wakes up.He soon learns that he has to find six other sleepers wich include: practical Sarah, cocky Jake, egotisticl Dave, cowboy Reb, beutiful Abbey, and small Wash. Josh and the rest of the sleepers have to save the Nuworl from the forces of evil"
4,"Blue eyes, green eyes, blonde hair, brown hair......","I love these books, all of them are teriffic reads, and I finished the whole first ten in a week! But be prepaired to be a little irritated with the inconsistancy of the books. One charector, Reb has bleach blond hair and blue eyes, then in another book he has red hair and green eyes. Another thing is that all the 'princess' charectors are going to have either blond hair and blue eyes, or red hair and green eyes. There must have been some sort of rebellion in wich all brunetts were banished to the four courners of the earth! :) Also this book wasn't the best in the series, for the simple reason that it was too little time and too much to say and do in that little time. On the other hand, though, I do sugjest not reading the others 'till you have read this one!"
5,Bob Welch - The Other One,Songs Include :1. Rebel Rouser2. Love Came 2 X3. Watch The Animals4. Straight Up5. Hideaway6. Future Games7. One On One8. Don't Let Me Fall9. Spanish Dancers10. Old Man Of 17
3,Not so Good,I find this book a little bit boring but some parts of this book are quite good. This book didn't put much smile on my face. Sorry Mr. Ziglar ....
3,Great ring but order a size bigger than normal.,I wish I had ordered a size larger than i needed. It fits like normal but I cant really bend my finger like I should because it gets to tight. For price it is a good deal.
1,NEVER Received the item,It has been over a month now - and I have not received this item!Also - another similar item I purchased from the same vendor fell apart just hours after I put it on.No tracking information on the items - either.
4,not worth 2.99,"they only reason why I gave this 4 stars and not 5 it's because it should have been free or at least .99, but regardless it was a cute short film"
1,Infuriating,"One of the most un-memorable musicals I have heard. Simply cheap & awful. You will not remember one single melody, nor a good lyric."
2,Adequate at best,"Nice performances of derivative music (too many piano notes...could study some Bill Finn), trivial story, not empathetic characters. Terribly disappointing. Save your bucks. Alison Fraser, as always, is tremendous, even with a lousy score."
2,A historical (hysterical?) first effort,"Weak and laughable compared to their brilliant later work, the Queensryche EP will give museum curators at Seattle's Experience Music museum something to talk about, but little more. ""The Lady Wore Black"" is a strong ballad, and can be found on just about every live recording they've done since. Save yourself the money on this overpriced EP and pick up anything from ""Rage For Order"" onward. That's when the band starting making amazing, artistic, engaging, gothic, evil, sad, warm, cold, brilliant music."
3,Queensryche - The Beginning,"Today Queensryche is looked at as one of the pioneers of progressive metal. The band burst on to the scene with this EP in 1983. I remember first hearing ""Queen Of The Reich"" on a late night radio program and it immediately caught my attention. There were other bands doing similar material, but there was something about these guys that separated them from the pack. Geoff Tate's soaring vocals and Chris Degarmo and Michael Wilton's twin shredding guitars really hooked me. The other standout track on this CD is ""The Lady Wore Black"" which would be a forbearer of the more progressive metal oriented direction this band would carve in the future."
4,Not all inclusive,"This book doesn't have all of the 14ers in it, but there is a list of them in the back that will help you in finding the routes it doesn't have."
5,The best for snow.,"Like the first volume, this book is best utilized for skiing and snow-climbing. It has an excellent variety of routes, explanations of ratings, and useful safety information. While Dawson's guide is usable for the non-snow season, it is not quite as good asColorado's Fourteeners, 3rd Ed.: From Hikes to Climbsfor those climbing in the dry season."
1,Not durable- Lost part in first 5 min,Not durable- Lost part in first 5 min that was necessary to fly the kite. It was a wire that fit in the top of the head- Kite is broken after 15 min of use.
3,Express really means EXPRESS!,"I had a little trouble keeping up with this DVD. It moves VERY fast and you need a lot of room around your step. If you are very advanced and have a large room, you will probably like this work out. If not, you may want to make another choice."
5,Magnificent!,"We received this whimsical piece for a wedding present. How curious! Since we make our coffee with a french press (the ONLY way to make really good coffee in the home), we have to heat the water separately, and the Michael Graves teakettle is a joy to use every time. It's very large, but it doesn't take up a ridiculous amount of space, certianly not for something that's used daily, and the spinning action that accompanies the extra-loud whistle is just plain fun. It feels very sturdy, the handle lends itself to a comfortable pour. Sure, it's not for every kitchen, but every kitchen *should* be as fun and practical as this kettle. Next time we build a house, we'll design the kitchen around this thing."
4,Alice-in-Wonderland,"Every time I enter my kitchen and look at my stovetop, I feel like I'm about to have tea with the Red Queen and the Mad Hatter! This kettle was an impulse buy at Target and I don't regret it a bit. My old, rather undersized kettle was a piece of junk; it didn't even whistle anymore (which was kind of dangerous, actually.) This product is a keeper--it's cheerful whimsical, it holds a great deal of water, and it works! Boiling water greets you with a whistle and a madly spinning corkscrew. The only drawback is that it is rather heavy to lift when filled to capacity, so it's not for anyone who's really tiny, or has a weak grasp. The price was also extremely reasonable for such an artsy, functional, and substantial piece. It would make a GREAT wedding gift, or a just-because gift. I'm buying another one to send to my cousin, whose kettle is also due for the junk heap. Thanks for this fun and useful item."
4,FUN POT!,"From the moment that I first saw this teakettle, I knew I wanted it. I love the colors and especially the whirligig spinner on the spout (I'm truly a kid at heart!)One problem mars the product so it only gets 4 stars: the lid keeps getting stuck. I tried to call the company that manufactures the kettle to inform them of the problem. The company was looking for a product number. I gave them every single number that appeared on the box, and they did not recognize the number. So, I still have a pot with a lid that is hard to remove. As there are no Target stores in my immediate area, I will have to wait until I visit a town where I can go to exchange my teakettle."
2,"Nice design, cheap construction.",Bought this kettle because I liked the design. Unfortunately it's Grade C construction doesn't stand up to the heat of the kitchen. I guess you get what you pay for. The thin plating crazed and eroded from heat. The plastic whistle melted. When you poured water out of the spout it boiled and sputtered everywhere. It's edgy design is now enhancing the inside of my trash can.
2,"Great looks, shoddy construction","This kettle looks great, no doubt.But it is poorly constructed and dangerous. Be very careful opening the spout cover, or the steam will burn your fingers. Also the spout itself gets extremely hot. As a result, when you pour out water, the water boils the instant it flows through the spout, making it sputter and spill.Since pushing the spout cover lever is hazardous, I would push the spinner to open the cover. As a result, the spinner fell off after a couple of weeks. The tiny threads that the spinner screws in are stripped, so the spinner is history.Again, nice looks, but I would not buy it again."
1,Ouch!!,"I find it very difficult to open the spout without burning myself on the steam which I consider a major design flaw. Unlike most modern teapots which have a lever on the handle which opens the spout, this teapot does not and requires the user to put fingers in the direct path of the steam to open it."
1,This TeaKeattle Blows,"It doesn't really look good, just different, very different. If the truth be told the gimmick of the spinning rotelli is kind of tacky. But what gets me are two design flaws. If you're pouring a full load the air inside builds up to create a sort of bubble which makes the boiling hot water hic-up and stop momentarily and then spit out uncontrollably with extra force and splatter hot water out. Then there is this subtle leak from the bottom of where the spout joins the body sending a trickle of water down to collect on the underside and to drip into the gas ring often extinguishing the pilot light. Just poorly designed as are the other products I've gotten from Graves including a poorly balanced tooth brush."
1,Extremely Dangerous,"I bought this tea kettle because I loved the way it looked. I still do, but, it is really dangerous. The spout will snap shut when pouring and will redirect the stream of boiling water right back on your hand. And even if you hold it open, when the water hits the spout it will sometimes just spatter out as far as 3 feet. Both my husband and I have gotten small burns and just barely avoided some really serious scalds. I would warn everyone to NOT buy this product and if you have, throw it out before you end up in the emergency room."
1,This thing STINKS!,"I've bought 2 of these things, and both of them fell apart - the bottom rusted out. Also, they look great, but they are horribly dysfunctional - the top gets stuck, the water blurps out suddenly. THEY SUCK!"
1,"So bad..it burns, yes I'm talking about this teapot.","I was given this teapot as a gift, but it is the worst teapot I have used. On the box it said it was designed for people with disabilities in mind. I think what they really meant is that the terrible design of the pot, which allows the spout cover to drop suddenly while pouring, thus splashing hot water all over your hands, might make you disabled.Don't gift it, don't buy it, don't donate it."
1,How could I review something I do not have?,The item in the picture never came -- a substitute arrived which I did not want. I wanted this only the M. Graves Design Spinner Whistle Tea Kettle. Does anyone know where I can buy this?
1,Ouch,"Beautiful design, Hell on your fingers. Why don't designers actually use the products they design? If they had heated this tea kettle up, then pushed the spout down to open, they would have discovered their finger lands on the really hot spout. Dumb, dumb, dumb."
1,This is a dangerous product,"Keep looking! This is a dangerous product. When the kettle has water in it that&#146;s boiling really high, during pouring, the water comes shooting out of the spout in an impossible to control manner. My fiancé and I both have been scalded on the hand that was holding the cup. Another time it shot over into the sugar bowl instead of the cup (was an annoying mess for first thing in the morning). I do, however, like it&#146;s funky style."
3,Great Design Graves Teakettle,"Our second of the GBraves' designed teakettles - but this one is quite a bit lighter, and not very sturdy. For regular use, fine - just not as well constructed as the original one Graves did that Allessi manufactured. though we love the style and design of this one as well. The spinner whistle works well. We just wish it was made to higher standard/weight - we want it to last a long time!"
2,So much for spinner,The teakettle was a gift. The spinner worked about 3 months and quit.Now it's difficult to get the spout lid to stay open.Cute idea but didn't hold up.
3,Adobe Installer PAIN,"Forget putting this on two of your computers, they require you to now buy 2 copies. This is a real pain. Sure you can go back and forth and authorize it each time, what a bother; Adobe has gone greedy and given us a pain to use their products. Hey Adobe, I know it's a single license, but you make it a bother...I can really only use one computer at a time! NO TRUST!I will skip every other version to get even! TRUST ME PLEASE! I think you guys are doing okay at the bank!The product is good but takes more resources every version, filled with glut. I have not tried the video features yet, but they look very cool."
2,Concerns about Adobe,"I have not upgraded yet from CS2 to CS3 and was just checking out the pricing on amazon and read the reviewer who said Adobe would not let him install his Photoshop software on two computers at the same time. This is in direct contradiction to what I've been told previously by Adobe and that is that Photoshop can be installed (and used) on both your desktop and laptop.I called Adobe customer service and the person who answered was not equipped to answer this simple question about the software so she transfered me to Adobe SALES who told me that I can do this. When I tried to ask how and explain that my concern came from reading a review that said Adobe did not allow it he told me I would have to talk to Customer Service.So Sales says this can be done, Customer Service cannot communicate."
3,very nice shoe,"This was a very nice shoe, stylish, but on my feet the sides gapped and the toes were too tight. I think it's my feet and not the shoe."
5,goat head ring,I love he reactoin i get when I wear this ring .It was even better then the picture on the web.
2,"Kindle version, poorly formatted","I love Charles Swindoll. But the Kindle version of this book has problems. Very poorly formatted and difficult to read. Something is wrong with the font that was chosen by the publisher. As much as I like the content, I deleted it off my Kindle because it was too ugly."
1,Not so good,"The album 'Loving You Baby' is not so good as the album 'Last Kiss', especially the title song 'Last Kiss' is a one-hit wonder in Thailand."
3,"nice upgrade, but could be better","this would be a great upgrade for someone using a 200-500 mhz pc, but if you have a older pc than check with your motherboard manufacturer or pc manufacturer before doing anything.At this price you could get a hole new motherboard and an AMD chip running at a ghz. If you have an old pc you should probably get a new motherboard anyway."
2,Disappointing. Needs Color & more emphasis on Perl & APIs,"This was disappointing. The emphasis of the book is on the ImageMagick commandline tools rather than the APIs. There are a lot of photographs but they're all black and white. The before and after samples are worse than useless - they just take up space. It's probably not the Author's fault.Apress (the publishers) should really have done this book properly and included glossy color pages where needed. As it stands, it's impossible to tell from looking at the before-and-after photos in the book, what most of the image operations are supposed to do. This is just cheap on the part of the publishers.Stick to the online imagemagick tutorials and give this book a miss."
3,Good introduction AND poor as well,This book is a good introduction into ImageMagick. Nevertheless I find it disappointing there is not even one single colored image printed in there. This book discusses different image manipulation functions on color images and only shows B/W images.I would have appreciated this information in the product presentation. Really poor
5,Excellent Time Travel,"At 60 I lived through both Clapton & Winwood's careers. I met Van & played with him at his house upstate New York and saw them both multiple times during their careers. Eric mentored Steve on guitar as Steve stepped away from his B3. The two were destined to be & MSG was a proving ground for him. Together is where they were meant to be and they compliment each other so well. Steve looks at Eric as a younger brother would, smiling at Eric during the show and you can see he is in awe at Eric's handiwork. They blend together so well. If you like both of their discographies then you will love the DVD. Van hasn't changed vocally and will not disappoint. It' a fine collaboration and at Eric during two hour concert you'll love."
3,Highly compressed audio on default stereo track,"Winwood is one of my favorite musicians. I treasure all of the old Traffic music. And I've always liked Clapton. I thought the performances on the BluRay were very good. But the audio was inexcusably bad on the default track. And there's no indication that there is any track other than the stereo track. It turns out that there is a DTS track which is much better, though not great. Compression is useful for broadcast radio these days, since so many people listen to music while driving, it's the only way the quiet passages in music can be heard while driving an automobile. But to compress the audio track of a BluRay disc is ludicrous. My forty year old vinyl LPs have more dynamic range than this BluRay disc has on the stereo track. It's truly pathetic. The BluRay disc should default to the DTS track. Shame on the producers for making such a basic error."
2,what a 'sound' dissapointment,"Live from Madison Square GardenI really looked forward to owning this DVD... but in one word the quality of the sound STINKS! What a pity, concerts from the eighties sound better than this. HEY AMAZON - can I return this?"
5,WENT TO THE SHOW!,"I WENT TO THE SHOW IN PHILADELPHIA AFTER WATCHING THIS DVD. IF YOU LIKE THE OLD CLAPTON,TRAFFIC AND BLIND FAITH STUFF BUY IT. BLUE RAY IS GREAT!"
1,live from madison square garden,"disc is damaged,only plays about 1/2 of the cd, i didnt know i was getting a used cd,my bad. ill look better next time i purchase anything here again.tried to return it,cant since i dont have a printer to print return label"
4,Clapton/Winwood on Blu-Ray,"I am disappointed that the Audio options are limited to ""Stereo"" and ""DTS surround"".The disc does not offer Dolby True HD, DTS Master Audio or even Dolby Digital andto get it to play in DTS you have to select ""Stereo"" in the audio options. Once youfigure that out, it sounds pretty good. Besides that it's a great concert"
2,PCM stereo?,I suppose stereo was a nostalgia bit but a Blu-ray from 2007 that was recorded and preesnted elsewhere in 5.1 surround sound was a disappointment. This blu-ray version should have been 5.1 but it wasn't. Other versions hopefully have better sound.
2,"Great features, horrible editing decision","Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood put on a trio of fantastic shows, and the audio from this package proves that. Sadly, half of this DVD unwatchable due to the lack of continuity. Unlike the Cream 2005 DVD where performances from particular nights are showcased, this video is chopped up from all three nights with changes in appearance frame to frame. Bloody-freaking-annoying. The bonus features are very enjoyable. A nice 34 min documentary, and bonus performances make Disc 2 more entertaining than the concert itself. I say skip the DVD and buy the CDs from this concert."
2,Disappointing,"Poor quality video and disappointing sound reproduction. This could have, and should have been a great disc. I wish I would've rented this before leaping into buying it based upon the premise of two musical greats."
3,Mediocre blu-ray sound & poorly shot,"I saw this at a friends house, ready to order it after we listened, but I was disappointed. Performances uninspiring, horribly lit stage and poorly shot. The hand held cameramen must have come from a home for cameramen with Lou Gehrig's disease. The have trouble holding the camera relatively steady (and don't give me that ""it's shaky cam"" BS). They also have trouble holding focus (and don't give me that ""it's artistic"" BS). But the person who has to be held responsible for this is the director, as it's his call on lighting and he directs the cameramen. It's all an embarassment.Want to really hear and see these guys perform well, buy the 2007 Eric Clapton Guitar Festival- and ignore the Amazon reviewers comments."
4,good to the last note,"this dvd is so good that after I had purchased the album I had to see the video,and it did not let me down. The interviews were insightful and etertaining sa well.there was only one song that I did not like and that is track # 12, steve's voice didn't lend well to that one."
2,Atticus,I was very disappointed with this DVD. It may have met all of the critical criteria as to sound quality but I wanted to hear Eric Clapton and this DVD is mostly Stevie Winwood. Would not buy again.
1,eric clapton steve winwood,"THE BLUE RAY DISK,IS OF VERY POOR QUALITY,RED LINES ALL THRU,CAN'T WATCH IT,THE SOUND IS OK. ILL PROBABLY BUY WERE I CAN JUST RETURN IT."
4,Great to see these two....,"It was great to see these two playing together. Since I had never seen Steve Winwood live, I was pleasantly surprised to see that he also played guitar as well as keyboards. Loved every minute. I never tire of watching Eric play. So natural and talented. Nothing else needs to be said."
2,"Excellent Show, Very Bad Audio","I really loved to see Eric and Steve playing together again, and the show is amazing! The image on blu-ray is really incredible, and the selection of songs are also phenomenal. You will find very good musics like:* After Midnight* Rambling On My Mind (**)* Georgia On My Mind* Little Wing* Voodoo Chile* Can't Find My Way Home (**)* CocaineThe down side of the blu-ray is the sound quality, reason why I'm returning the blu-ray (and will try the DVD - hope it is better), is horrible with an intermittent noise on the guitars, for both: Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood. I tried both formats DTS and Dolby, but the noise persist. I read other reviews for the blu-ray format and I noticed I was not the only one complaining about the quality.It was good to hear my favorite Eric Clapton songs again (**), but if you are looking for a good quality sound, look for the Jeff Beck blu-ray - a fantastic show and excellent quality."
4,Much better on DVD than CD,"When reviewing this on CD, I only gave it three stars - - due to what I see as an uninspired set list. I give the DVD four stars instead of three because the visual presentation compensates for the set list. This works much better as a concert film: the camera angles focus on the soloists, and the cameras stay long enough to make you feel like you're there.But I won't give it five stars, because the performances are interspersed with interview clips. The interviews are informative, but they break the momentum. (Everything said in these clips is also part of the interviews on the second DVD in the set, so they could have left these out of the concert portion.)"
5,Eric and Stevie live from my recliner,What a amazing concert! and the best part it is blu-ray with great sound and I do not have to leave my living room
2,Falls off!,"The price was great and the diffusor does what it is supposed to do - WHEN it stays attached! It continually falls off my external flash and was hard to keep track of. Because of this, I have not used it much because IT KEEPS FALLING OFF! I was using it with a Canon 430 external. Did I mention it kept falling off? ;-)"
4,For the camera buff,I ordered this for a friend who loves photography. Product came quickly after I ordered it and she liked it.
2,ok but not great,"provides ample diffusion, causes a lot of light loss, falls off easily, very expensive for a piece of plastic. I am going to try making my own with a less opaque plastic, and with a larger surface area a la Gary Fong."
3,No snapping device,"I have bought this diffuser along with other items for my EOS kiss camera.The first thing I notice that the diffuser does not have any snapping shoulder or anything to secure it on the flash. It is not a problem if you use it at home, but if you are going to use outdoors or at a wedding, you may lose it. This diffuser makes photos softer with less shadows."
3,"okay, but...","I have noticed some change in the quality of the pics, but with a bounce flash, the change has been subtle. Better if the flash has been directly aimed at the subject. It also tends to fall off easily. I think it is overpriced (can't cost more than 15 cents to produce)."
5,"A wonderful, timeless surprise","This book reads like poetry and the characters are wonderful. Like an archeological dig, new layers are revealed as one proceeds through the beautiful prose. I wonder why books like this disappear when so many others, less deserving, take their place?"
1,Bad Investment,"I bought this pump and used it on three bikes, a total of 5 tires before the foot pedal bent, then broke. If you need a pump, I suggest going to a bike store and paying for a good one. I tried to go the inexpensive route and learned my lesson. Bell products are cheaply made and don't last beyond a few uses. Don't make my mistake and disappoint your kids on a Sunday when there's nothing you can do about it except to drive to the nearest gas station for air. Stay away from this, and other ""pedestrian"" pumps. Makes you wonder what a Bell helmet will look like after a spill!"
1,"5 ""Stomps"" and it's broken","Didn't pump any air into the tire the first 2 ""stomps"" ... tried it again another day, 3rd ""stomp"" and the gauge went flying off. Put the gauge back on and it still doesn't work. Biggest waste of money. Never even filled one tire"
1,Connector Blew Apart,"This device looks like a good piece of equipment, but it is made with cheap materials. My 15 year old son apparently didn't connect it properly to the tube he was trying to inflate, put his weight on the foot pump, and the device that connects the pump to the bike tube blew apart! This is a piece of junk!"
1,Piece of junk,"Gauge was cracked at pump when I used first time. Therefore no air could get to tire. Bought at Walmart, so this is not a surprise, but thought I would at least get a few uses out of it"
1,Terrible pump but Bell warranty replaced it with another,"Terrible product. Began bending/flexing within 4 months of ownership and infrequent usage.Called Bell and told them what was happening. Told them I'd owned it for about 4 months and they're sending out a replacement, free of charge. They said they no longer manufacture this product but would replace it with something similar.I like that warranty support. Hopefully what they send will be more durable than this product."
1,Horrible Product-Buyer Beware,"I've always found Bell products to be horribly made, but the Bell FootPumper Multi-Sport Pump takes the cake for one of the worst products ever.I was gentle with this thing when I first got it because A) It looked flimsy, and B) I figured it wouldn't last forever at $19.It didn't even last pumping up two bikes.After I pumped up the first bike, the rubber foot pad flew off (and mind you, I was being ""gentle"" with this and working it slowly).As I started the third bike, the whole thing fell apart. The tire pressure reader busted open, and there was an air leak from the main unit. I tried working it for a while, but nothing happened.I was stupid because A) I bought another Bell product, and B) I didn't look at reviews before buying this thing.Shame on me.That being said, I will never, ever purchase anything made by Bell, and I will make it a point to spread the word.Stay away from this product-It's horrible."
1,Flimsy piece of junk.,"Made the mistake of buying one of these about a month ago, and I'll never buy anything from Bell again. The band-iron that connects the pedal to the cylinder can't take the force of a foot, and it bent the second time I used it. I put this question to the manufacturer: you probably spent $5 on materials, sold it for $30 at retail, and PERMANENTLY lost a customer. Is that what you intended to do?"
1,This is a horrible product,I used it once and it bent. It is horrible and possibly the biggest piece of junk of any kind that I have ever had the misfortune of spending money on. I cannot overstate how pathetic this pump is. Don't waste your money.
2,Not for a road bike,"I picked this pump up at a Marshalls for $8.00 and hoped it would save me from having to pay $40.00 for one at a bike shop. I was wrong. The tag advertises that it is good up to 100 PSI, but when I used the presta adapter, the nozzle would not stay on past about 60 PSI before it popped off. Obviously this would not do for my road bike tires that need to go up to 116 PSI. I did not use it for schraeder valves, which don't require the adapter, or for mountain bike tires, which require less PSI. In those instances it might work.Also, the gauge was difficult to read, because the needle simply jumps around a lot without giving a solid reading. Finally, for me, the foot stomp was not very convenient. Because I had to be on the ground trying to hold the nozzle on to the valve, I ended up having to use my hand to push the foot pump. All in all not a great product for my needs, and I would recommend purchasing something else instead."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BRAND,"Bought the Bell foot pump and noticed immediately the psi gauge fluctuated erratically and was unreliable. The foot pump literally disintegrated after a month's use, where I was forced to use nails and tape to prolong the use of a design built from extremely substandard parts and materials. I just replaced it with a Zefal pump which so far has worked beautifully and came with presto and schrader settings. The mangled Bell pump is in the trash can."
1,"Does not work right out of the box. And Yes, I am a Mechanical Engineer","This product is amazingly bad. I bought it at the store for over 20 bucks and it does not work first try. Took apart, checked the seal, and it clearly is a bad design. In engineering terms the problem is the tolerance stack. The bore for the tube is too large for the seal so air leaks right past it. This pump will only work if you dump a load of grease in it to close the air gaps. That is why the other reviews show it does not work after a few times: the grease spreads out and eventually the giant gap opens up and you leak. Will be returning this horrible product. Made in China."
1,cheap & a waste of cash,The first time I tried to use this it bent. I wld strongly suggest you do not buy this.
1,Bent on first use,"I thought this was a great idea for a bike tire, knowing I had at least 2 bikes that needed pumped up, I picked it up. It worked well on the first tire, I went to pump the second tire and it bent and the rubber pad broke off. I was able to bend it back enough (with my hands - to show you how weak it is) to put it back in the box until I return it. It would have been a great pump had it not been cheaply made."
2,Inaccurate,"The size was preferred, but I thought the numbers were off; and accessories were missing. Bell air Stomper thumbs down!"
2,smaller than expected,"This bag is much smaller than expected. From the product description, I'd expected to at least a letter-sized notepad, but the zipper opening is not wide enough. It's made from sturdy stuff, but some of the stitches from the inside pocket were undone. Disappointed. I WILL try to find a more suitable bag."
5,Good for carry-on,"I really like the size; for the few things you don't want to check, it's perfect. I would have liked maybe one or two outside pockets, say, on either end, sized for a cellphone or mp3. But on the whole, I'm very happy with this. It's still new, so I can't comment on it's durability, but it looks like it should last."
5,Works,"Does exactly what it says it will worked for my 2000 alero, easy way to go from stock to aftermarket radio"
3,saucepan handle - too narrow,"A 4 quart saucepan is impossible to find in stores. Originally I owned a T Fal lightweight non stick pan, but apparently they don't make them in that size any more. I purchased the Cuisinart because it was non stick and 4 qts, but because of my arthritis, the handle is very uncomfortable and it's too heavy and narrow for my hand which makes it difficult to hold comfortably."
4,An inspired move from pop to folk/traditional music,"I have always liked Natalie Merchant's voice, especially with her overtly pop songs. So I was very taken by surprise when I first heard the folk/traditional songs that fill ""The House Carpenter's Daughter."" It struck me as an inspired move on her part, and I really think that she nailed it. I truly don't understand some of the very negative reviews. This is a very enjoyable CD from start to finish and represents a nice change of pace from most of her other offerings. Highly recommended."
1,WHAT is this woman's PROBLEM?,"My god, look at the way she's staring at you from the cover. She looks EXACTLY like Kathy Bates in Misery. I loved the Maniacs from Nat to Mary Ramsey (haven't heard Oskar yet), but since Nat went off on her own I wonder if she needs psychological / emotional therapy. Have you listened to any of her solo albums? They are nothing but depressing, melancholy dirges. I listened to Tigerlily once and knew SOMETHING was wrong with her. Get on a treadmill, go for a walk, eat some Prozac - do SOMETHING. If anyone felt like putting a gun to their temple after listening to her sullen, mopey tunes I think I'd understand - this is not something you listen to for solace. Now, I'm not suggesting she go the Jewel route and issue an electronic / dance album, but really, she needs to lift herself up off the floor and let the sun in."
1,"Natalie baby, why so jaded?","This album starts off badly, tails of in the middle, and the less said about the end the better. Apart from that, it's great."
1,the agony of listening to natalie merchant,my mum constantly listens to natalie merchant and i can't stand it! natalie cannot sing or even pronounce words properly. i hope this is her last album for good!
1,Not punk enough!,"There' no punk on this cd. Natalie's other band she used to be in 10,000 Maniacs were a hardcore punk band. You can tell by the name. I never heard them, but I imagine they sound like well a bunch of maniacs. This is like peter pall and mary or sunny and cher stuff. I was dissapointed!! Get Distillers new one instead!"
3,"It's alright, just not for me.","I first fell in love with Natalie Merchant during the unplugged 10,000 Maniacs session and further in love with Tigerlily and sheer infatuation with Ophelia. The NY Live album was completely WOW and I couldn't wait for her next offering. However her latest string of albums haven't impressed me at all. I understand an artist tries to grow creatively however her growth is not my entertainment. I will continue listening to her ""old stuff"" and I will always be on the lookout for her newest album to see if my tastes change. Also what's up with the cover picture of this album. You're a beautiful lady Natalie!!! That picture doesn't do you justice."
3,Took me forever to like,"Natalie's new album, ""The House Carpenter's Daughter"", is a collection of folk songs and Natalie treats these songs as if they were her own. Natalie was born to sing folk music and it shows through in her passionate singing on most of the tracks. Inititally I disliked this album but it's grown on me since I purchased it in late 2003. This album is definitely not for everyone, but it's a true testament to Natalie's gift for producing excellent albums."
1,useless,I thoiught the CD would be easy and searchable. I dicovered that it is not compatable with Windows EX. Wasted time!
4,Boo-Yaa,If you like r&b and rap you will like this album. This one has more jazz and up beats that show their talents in other areas rather than just rap. Rap has gone instrumental with this album and you will probably like it.
2,true musicc fan,"I DIDNT LIKE THIS ALBUM BECAUSE ITS PRIMARILY ROCK AND IT DOESNT SEEM TO FIT THEM AS WELL AS HARDCORE HIP HOP DOES. I DO LIKE SOME ROCK MUSIC BUT THIS ALBUM DOESNT REALLY DO IT FOR ME. MAYBE IM JUST NOT A BIG ENOUGH FAN OF THE BOO YAA TRIBE. THE CD WAS REALLY CHEAP, BUT STILL. NO THANKS."
2,This Book Is Not What You Think,"The title of this book and the cover photo are misleading. This is not a book about tigers, or tigerattacks, or tigerhunting. It's a book about a region of India where tigers frequently attack humans. Sounds interesting, but the book doesn't focus on the tigers---it focuses on exploring the religious/mythical beliefs of the primitive local people. Many of the people believe that the tiger attacks are controlled by spiritual entities. If you are killed by a tiger, it's because a local ""spirit"" wanted you dead.Make no mistake. This is NOT a book for readers who expect to read about tiger attacks, or tiger hunting. It's not a Peter Capstick-type adventure book about hunting dangerous game. This is an anthropology book, presuming to answer questions that nobody asked. Montgomery's prose style is gracefully lyrical, but the book's structure is non-linear, disjointedand often confusing. Wake me up when it's over (snore)"
5,The source on mercenaries in the 20th century,"This book offers the most complete description of mercenary action in the past century. Very detailed, very much fact, but reads like a novel. Read what Forsyth based his 'Dogs of War' on.If it is out of print, try to order it somewhere else (thru Amazon) because this one is worth it!"
4,Does what it is suppose to do,"First off I bought it from Lowes Twice lol, the first time the tool was well designed wrong( it was flawed). It would reaming the pipe it was suppose to but the actually screw driver part of it was to long for the couples for the pipe so I had to take it back. The second works but have not need to use it in months since I have not been on a job where I needed to use much if any pipe as of lastMaybe it is just me but Klein has some nice tools but for some reason I seem to buy ones with flaws. Like the 10:1 U just got( I bought two) the first one works great, the second one some of it is loose and sometime falls out if it grips the screw any."
1,Ranting and raving,"This tract will appeal to the anti-Semite in every Christian. The negative characterics attributed to Jews can be found in most Christians, or even non-Christians.Christianity (specifically the Catholic Church) has more blood on its hands that Stalin or Mao combined. When the Moors occupied southern Iberia, Muslims and Jews lived in harmony. That relationship came to an end when Spain became Catholic. Jews were either expelled or forced to convert to Christianity at the end of a sword. So much for Christian charity.I agree that the pro-Israeli lobby in the United States is too powerful, and that Jewish neoconservatives are trying to push this country into a war against Iran that would be tragic, all for the sake of Israel.But this document is a one-sided distortion of history, and what purport to be facts bear little relation to the truth.How disappointing it is to see the approbation by which this novel has been received."
3,Avid Reader,"The book was just okay. It was short and lacked a strong story line. It ended quickly and I was left wanting more of the story, which was a good concept. I actually bought the book by mistake thinking it was by my favorite author Jaid Black. Overall the book was a good read."
2,Had Potential...,"but the ending of this book was a complete let down.First I will say that I really felt that Talin was in love with Aliyah. Why? I'm not sure, because she was a flake. Completely helpless and snooty. I just didn't like her.I tried to look beyond the heroines shortcomings because I was fascinated with this universe. However by the end, I was left with many questions and not in a good way."
5,ROMANCE,"Everything I hoped for and more a definate buy for all beauty and beast fans who enjoy a bit of romance,that seems to be missing today . Ron Perlman is so sexy charming and adorable . Still looking for him .watch at least one a day, yes I am addicted to any thing to do with B&B just love it"
4,T.Johnston Review,Just love this product. I remember watching this as a young teen. Just love the series.
5,Wonderful,"I am so happy that Beauty and the Beast is now on DVD. I never was able to see all the episodes since I lived overseas most of my life, and now I am thoroughly enjoying them. It was a tresaure of a series."
5,Wonderful & Magical,"Beauty and the Beast - The Second SeasonHas wonderful stories lines in them. Ron & Linda are always talking about how the stories in this season 2 brought to them & what the stories are about. I think watching seasons 1 & 2 are wonderful & magical to those who enjoy listening to the music,stories,readings from all the books within the Beauty and the Beast . If you love being in a world that'sdifferent to the eye & listening to your heart within watching these wonderful DVD'S from the 80's this is for you. Something that us fan can ever be without in our hearts. Can't wait for the 3rd season coming soon I hope before this year is over. :)"
3,Perfect in region 2 or multiregion with subtitles,"I love this tv serie. But the only fault is that it is only in English, without the posibility of taking it in region 2 and with subtitles.Me parece horroroso que esta serie únicamente se puede obtener en region 1 y solamente en ingles sin posibilidad de subtitulos.No he tenido otra posibilidad pero me gustaria que esta serie se pudiera conseguir en multiregion, y aunque no se pueda conseguir en idioma europeos, como en español...u otro, se podría hacer una versión Pal con subtitulos en otros idiomas.No creo que sea tanto trabajo...."
5,Charming edition,"This is essentially the same US release of Mariah Carey's Charmbracelet, with two (2) extra tracks: Miss You, and I Know What You Want. I enjoy the 2 new edition of songs...but I still can't enough of Mariah's talented voice!"
1,Tiresome and Sanctimonious--Nearly Unreadable,"Save your money, but more than that, save your time. Joshi seems to be channeling Dorothy Parker in his vicious ""critiques"" of modern horror writers. He doesn't just keep his vitriol for the writers either--there's plenty of contempt for the ""uneducated"" readers. Joshi is apparently the embodiment of ""those who can't"" gripe about those who do. Check this guy's credits. He hasn't done anything beyond editing and deconstructing. This book is mean-spirited, off-base and laughably pompous. This guy needs to remove the stick."
4,Highly informative,"The tome combines all but the most personal aspects of sex and sexuality for the D20 system. I have seen many older forms of this throughout the ages of D&D (and AD&D), but this one work sums it all up. The only thing it lacks is the bio-functions (i.e. monthly cycles, measurements, etc.) for the races expressed. I would have liked to have seen a chart to the fertility cycles (and the variance thereof) as well as the weight and dimensional gains for internal gestations. Otherwise, this book has all the essentials for adding in sexuality and relationships not covered by general role playing."
1,out of date techniques,"The latest version of this book is from 1988 and the book uses lots of traditional, but largely out of date corrections that have been replaced in most obedience training circles with postitive training techniques. I have elected to return the book instead of having my niece learn these dog obedience techniques."
4,Dog Training for Kids,"Purchased for my 14 year old grandson to work effectively with his new dog. Book arrived in very good condition. Having reviewed it briefly before presenting it to my grandson, it appeared to be well organized and written in a style to promote involvement. While not a dog person myself, the techniques presented seemed to encourage proper behavior development through positive reinforcement thus developing a strong relationship between trainer and dog."
4,A very handy desktop dictionary,"This a good desktop dictionary for students who are studying Spanish and French either at the highschool level or in university. It offers a direct translation of the word in question, a phonetic pronunciation guide in brackets for each word and some idiomatic expressions where applicable. There is a handy verb conjugation chart in French and Spanish with model verbs and irregular verbs which would assist students with verb conjugation queries in all tenses. This a great resource on a small scale meaning it only has about 30.000 entries (approx.). If you are looking for a handy desk top dictionary in French/Spanish - Spanish/ French this is a worthy investment."
4,"Randolfo Ortiz, República Dominicana","Buen diccionario para todo aprendiz de francés. Cabe mencionar que como este material está a un bajo precio NO se puede esperar mucho, pues tú obtienes calidad según lo que pagas. Me gustó mucho la fonética de las palabras, las conjugaciones verbales, las expresiones idiomáticas, entre otras cosas más. Este diccionario no está ilustrado pero como dije en principio, es recomendable para personas en nivel básico y medio."
5,Good product.,"Pretty good complete dictionary. Find it very useful for someone just trying to learn a language. There may be others just as good or better, but I find this one to be very good."
3,A let down,"The book really had very little to do with 2 girls and their fake Ids. The ""trouble"" they get into is really not that troubling. And it is completely glossed over so the book missess all details. The book is about a few situations that the main character gets into (mainly sex, grades, and fighting with mom and dad). No new ground here and nothing that you have never seen or read before."
4,Good reading,The short stories in these books are designed to teach moral and right behavior. It is not necessarily a christianbook but it's highly moral.My children find them interesting and read them quite often.
2,Cycle:All Terrain - With Brooke Hayward DVD,"It is a good spin workout, however there is very little scenic riding. small screen appears a few times. expected more terrain riding and less studio riding."
1,Waste of money,"This was of no help to me at all. The instructor who appears very masculine talks in a loud, irritating voice and peddles very fast so it's not good for a beginner or intermediate rider. I tried to re-sell this DVD with no takers. Don't waste your money - Just ride your stationary bike for 20-30 minutes at a 90RPM or 25MPH and you'll be OK. Forget this product."
5,Fantastic Book!,The Imperishable Dominion gives an incredible analysis of the present world institutions. And gives great insights for the renewal of our society.
5,It is just OK not the songs that I wanted.,I listen to this on the radio or on my computer and the songs were not the ones that I wanted. It is just OK. Nothing special.
4,good mystery book,"This was a great treasure to get for my Kindle. Had a little baseball in it, and a mystery too. I'm giving this to my husband so he can read it next."
3,"It works fine, but...","I've been using Just for Men for years, but it's generally clear up around $8 or more now, both online & in my shopping area, IF I can find my color (Sandy Blonde)!I decided to try Revlon ColorSilk instead since it's only $2.92 at WalMart, & hey, there's no such thing as ""female"" hair! Well, you have to leave it on longer (25 min.) & you don't shampoo when you rinse it out, but otherwise it works the same as the Just for Men. It doesn't stink or smell ""girly"", you get plenty of it to use wherever you want (& they don't want), & it does a great job! Also, there are a bunch of blonde shades, they're IN STOCK, & the gloves are XL. I'm using their #61 blonde color & loving the results, so I plan to stay with the Revlon from now on, & would encourage you to go ahead & try it too! :-)"
2,sandy blonde fail...,"well I have black hair so I guess thats why it didnt work, and the label says it covers gray hair... I should have think twice before buying it..."
5,Great product,It is a fantastic product! My hair looks natural and I receive many compliments on how much younger it makes me look!
1,just did not work,"I followed all the directions and honestly could tell no difference in hair color, I was disappointed expecting gray to be gone. Sorry but would not recommend."
4,Vicously dark and funny. Of interest to Gay readers.,"I found this to be one of Dawn Powell's most entertaining books, deliciously dark and vicious. If you liked the cult classic film ""The Women"" you should find this delightful. This book is of particular interest to Gay readers as many of the main characters are realistically drawn Gays, something very rare in a book from the 1930's."
4,Witty satire on Cafe Society,"This novel captures the time when CAfe Society ruled the Greenwich Village scene. Ms Powell captures the nuances and slang of that time marvelously. As always, her wit and style shine through every sentence."
1,good until the screen went BLACK,same as the other customer; screen went black and the tv cannot be repaired. I am looking to buy a replacement after just 2 years. What a waste!!!
4,Lack of subtitles,The whole re-edition of the BFI material is great. The only thing missing on this dvd are the subtitles...
5,A righteous slab for any Booker T fan!,"Absolutely essential! And their version of ""Downtown"" is a MUTHA..."
1,Very drying to the skin.,First of all this product has more lavender oil in it than primrose oil according to the label of ingredients. Primrose oil is NOT one of the first three ingredients. Primrose oil is listed towards the end of the list of ingredients therefore one could safely assume that this bar contains a minimum amount of primrose oil. The lavender oil is strong therefore the soap stung a little. I will not re-order. I have decided to amend this review. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS INFERIOR PRODUCT. The soap provides no moisture at all. As a matter of fact it dried my skin out. This companies that advertise one thing and deliver nothing should be reported to the better busines bureau and amazon.com should do a better job ensuring that there sellers deliver the qualities that that purport to do.
3,Not what I expected,"This book is full of Bible Verses. Nothing more. I had hoped it would have more explanations. Definitely as a companion to the Bible, and in that respect it's great. But if you're hoping for explanations, you'll be disappointed as well."
2,Not what I expected...,"I bought this book thinking it included explanations and instructions for explaining and defending the Catholic Faith, but rather found that it mostly consists of a long list of Bible verses corresponding with each topic. For quick reference, it might prove helpful, but for educational purposes it was not very helpful to me."
5,Very Helpful,Very helpful book. I am helping with the RCIA group and this was very helpful in answering the many questions they had.
2,Basically just a list of Scripture locations,"Not what I had expected/hoped for. It's basically a do-it-yourself guide. A topic is listed as the title, then following is a list of Scriptural references (eg., Matthew 15: 6-8) supporting the Church's position. Usually there is NO explanation of the Church's position, nor what the Scripture reference says. So all of that needs to be filled in by the purchaser of the guide in order to make this pocket guide useful in real situations. I will likely return and look for something better. I bought this for my daughter who is dating a non-Catholic and she wanted to be able to ""back up"" some of the things our Church does (eg., infant baptism)."
3,Informative,It is a bit over my head because I have to analyze each reading. Comprehension is not my best suite
4,LILI,Abigail DeWitt's ability to weave sensuality and emotional intelligence into her characters is startling. Here is a perfect example of the richness of the female voice expressing the importance of a human being's interior life. Ms. DeWitt cuts to the bone with unique grace and narrative skill!
2,Too bad...,"I was so excited to get this book that when it finally arrived, I dove right into it immediately. Unfortunately, ten pages later all I wanted to do was dive out. While DeWitt is obviously a talented writer, I just felt no compassion for Lily, her title character. Lily just seemed so far away, and while I realize this disassociation was most probably a literacy device, used to describe Lily's own sense of being outside herself and her environment, it just made me bored and uninvolved in this character's fate. I just had no interest in what happened to Lily, and by the end I found her to simply be annoying and boring. In fact, I don't even remember the ending of this book, which shows how little impact it had on me. Unfortunately, the best thing about Lily is the beautiful cover, which proves you can't judge a book by its cover."
4,The Far Side Gallery 3,Always funny and kind of twisted at the same time. It's never dull and is almost always funny.
2,"Not so ""good"".","Far Side Gallery 3 book was listed as being in good condition ,but I had to tape the binding,the bottom hand corner was terribly bent and the clear coating on the cover is lifting as well.. Not happy with the shape of this book at all. It should have read heavily worn in the description. I definitely do not see this book as being in ""good"" shape with any stretch of the imagination. I am not going to be able to use this book as I intended, due to its shape! Am very disappointed with the seller,Winter Ventures."
3,What about faucets?,"We are trying to order this to turn a regular tub into a much needed shower. Are faucets included? If not, what faucets go with product? And if not, the pictures are very misleading, showing 2 views of the complete unit with faucets. So, which is it? Faucets or no faucets.Your ""Contact Us"" link DOES NOT WORK."
5,The Second Generation of the Hideaway Legacy Continues......,"If you are a first time reader to Rochelle Alers books, may I suggest before you read this one, to start at the beginning and read all of the ""Hideaway Legacy."" I say this because then you will be able to appreciate this continuing family saga. Well Rochelle, you did it once again and brought the warmth of this family love, and nurturing as we watched Martin and Parris's oldest child, Regina not only fight her past demons but find love and happiness with Aaron. Thanks for including the rest of the Cole/Kirkland/Sterling families and the other stories we have to look forward to as we head into the second generation of this family. You are an outstanding writer and much continued success into the new year!"
4,A Good Read,The plot starts out great with two passionate characters. It kind of fizzles in the middle of the book but it starts heating back up again between the two characters and their personalites and their families towards the end.
4,The Hideway series continues in Mexico,"At long last the long awaited ""Hideaway"" series is here with the second generation. Though this story didn't have the glamour and intrigue of the other ""Hideaway"" series, the details of the picturesque Bahia countryside with it's remarkable African history is well worth reading. The Portuguese and Spanish phrases will put the reader in the mood of Latin America."
5,A Wonderful Love Story!,"This is a wonderful love story that is very believable. I had my doubts about the marriage of Regina and the man old enough to be her grandfather, but Rochelle brought everything together nicely. The men in her stories are strong and possessive, but the women are strong and independent as well. Keep up the good work !"
3,Feeder unit good - timer part is cheap,"The main product works great, a geared down motor spins the auger slowly, durable made unit, comes with covers for outdoor use. The unit itself I recommend for portion control of small to medium dog food pieces etc, which i use it for. One of the mounting plastic pieces where broken on arrival, called the manufacturer (US importer) number and they sent a new one promptly.The timer is another story, the first one worked for 20 minutes, the second one they sent me has issues, wiggling the plugged in plug will contsantly leave the output on, cheap stuff. Resulution is to the second so the chip in it is ok."
3,Lid Up,"This Pyrex storage set was ordered because I needed a replacement for my 3 quartglass Pyrex storage bowl of a certain age. The cover on that bowl had split. WhenI received the new set, I was uncertain about the shape of the glass containers: notrounded bowls, but squattish truncated cones, unlike the rounded shapes which areso welcoming of just-off-the-stove soups. Although I'm resigned to the bowl shape,the covers are vexing. They do not fit easily on the glass containers. They do not sealwith a satisfying ""snap"" or ""snick."" In fact, they are difficult for aging fingers to get onat all.That said, I will continue to use these containers, hoping that, with time, the covers willbecome more relaxed."
4,Great Set,"I would highly recommend this to anyone who is considering buying food storage containers. It has kept my food fresh for days, they are very durable, and dishwasher safe."
4,Pretty and practical,"These are responsible for fewer dishes (no dishwasher here), less cleanup time & a prettier table. The day after Thanksgiving, I can just pop the leftovers in the microwave & put these dishes right out on the table because they look like serving bowls when their lids are off. They stack & look great - no more plastic tomato stains! The lids are a little hard to seal at first but once you get the knack, they are fine. I love them. I would not, however, get one for my arthritic mother-in-law since they can be a bit tough to open or seal at first. My only wish is that they came with glass lids for conventional oven use. They are not recommended for stove-top use."
3,"Decent, but I prefer the standard","This is a decent set, but the lids leak overtime and I find the lids and the containers to be a little larger and bulkier to store. I still use them, but I'm probably going to replace with the blue lid standard version for cabinet space and a more airtight seal."
4,the lids are a little small,"Great bowl set. I love pyrex stuff, however you really need to perform some sort of voodoo to get those lids on all the way!"
2,Redesign lids,The lids are really difficult to attach to the bowls. The little spout to open on the top for microwaving comes totally off instead of opening one hole for steam as it is meant to do. The bottom flat surface makes the bowls inappropriate for mixing things such as salad dressing that you might want to make and store without dirtying another dish.
1,No lid replacements,Hate to contribute to landfills. Why is it that the Corning is not at all bothered to make either durable lids or sell replacements......
2,What were you thinking?,"Here is a novel concept for a book: let's teach someone how to program in a language without code. Can it be done?The answer, of course, is yes ... if you rely on the Visual Studio .NET IDE, which this book does. More than a book on coding, this book is a step by step on how to create code with the Visual Studio .NET IDE, without actually writing code.This is not all bad, of course, as you can write some decent applications using this technique. However, it would have been nicer, if this was their intention, to include some screen shots. This book does not.On the plus side, there is an awful lot of theory in this book. This alone may make this a useful addition to your library. If you want to really learn to code Visual Basic .NET, go elsewhere."
2,"Not enough code, too much text",I really dislike programming books that don't give me lots of good code samples but I can't recall one with as little code as this book. I am going to return it as a result.
5,Kumagoro Wristband,"The 'kumagoro' wristband features the stuffed bunny belonging to Ryuichi Sakuma, one of the main characters in Maki Murakami's hit shonen-ai anime series 'Gravitation.' The wristband can please fans and simple collectors alike; the rabbit cute enough with little or no background knowledge. I only gave one star for education, but it could be used for or during exercise. The accessory is durable, although it shouldn't be left on your arm for too long, nor should it be exposed to weather, water, or any common sense destructive forces and also generates mild wear overtime. This is a must for fans, especially if you want to show your pride at the conventions for this loving and comedic series."
4,Nicely done.,"The Classical Express re-issues are, as a rule, well done and pleasant listening, and this one is no exception. I got Vol 2 a while ago, as well as the Piano Quartets. They are all nice additions to the library. The price is nice too."
4,Authentic Style Sounds,"This was one of three steel drum CD's purchased recently, and was the best of all. Great sounds...clear with good acoustics. Sounds really mellow coming from the speakers in our back yard paradise. Very authentic Caribbean sound. Just what we were looking for to give our outdoor entertaining a fun atmosphere."
3,not quite as relaxed as I was expecting...,"the musicians are talented, the music is well done, but for me, it doesn't have that lovely relaxed island sound... the kind where you close your eyes and can imagine being there... Some of the songs are almost manic. not quite what I was hoping for..."
2,Too hyper for my style...,"I wanted to relax to some soothing tropical steel drum music... most of the songs are at a tempo that makes me want to run around the house in ""fast motion."" So if you are looking for a rapid rhythm, this CD is for you."
3,Steel drum music- I've heard better,"I was looking for a music cd for steel drum music and took a chance on this one- unfortunately much of the music is ""pop"" played on a steel drum... just doesn't do it for me"
1,Awful!,I have been an ardent fan of steel drum music for many years. This cd was one of the worst exhibitions I have ever encountered.
5,Rumble!!!!!!,"Nice album from Dutch neo-rockabilly band The Rumble Cats! ""Soaking In A Hot Tub"" will always be one of my favourite songs, but other songs are as good as this one! Nice upright bass, hot guitar licks and a great voice. This record will make you bop all over the place."
5,Lovely as a rose garden in spring,"I was pleasantly surprise with this fragrance - thought it might be too ""ROSY."" It seemed a little strong at first with the rose scent being so pronounced but it softens and lingers on your skin--a light touch is important though. If you spray the air and walk into the scent it makes a perfect application. The bottle is beautiful. I get lots of complements but most important I love this very feminine scent. Lotion and shower gel are a good value."
1,Not like roses,"I was trying to find a perfume that smells like roses. My 90-year-old mother loves Avon's To a Wild Rose, which has been discontinued. I was hoping this perfume might smell like roses, but it does not. So, my quest goes on."
4,"Smells bad, but works","Don't take on an empty stomach, and try not to burp (as there's a punget smell and aftertaste). There is not doubt that this is some really highly concentrated fish oil!"
5,Tapped right,"This is the perfect ""repair tool"" for those of us that sometimes turn our screws a little to hard WOW what a find thanks"
2,decline of Klein,"I am a tool guy. Yea I have stickers on my tool box, and a SNAP ON catalog on my garage wall. I would rather go shoe shoping with my wife than set foot in a Sears store ever since they turned the craftsman line into garbage so many years ago.I received this tool after buying it sight unseen. I was very disapointed to find a such a professional line of tools using parts made in china. The taps and tap holder were both stamped MADE in china. REALLY.....Well At least when it breaks I can get a replacement for 80% less at the local flea market and still get the same warranty. I feel raped. good bye Klein"
4,Good tool,"I use this in counseling elementary age students. Guided drawing like this seems to work well with some children, not well with others, but can be very adaptable for different ages. I find it's a good way to start conversations with many students, and the drawing process itself seems to be very helpful to some. I really like pages on feelings; these are pretty much the same as some pages in Heegaard's other books.I will note that although the title says ""Separate"" many pages use the word divorce, so it gets tricky to use with my students whose parents are separated but not divorced. I just pick and choose the pages that don't say ""divorce"" or use the other pages to inspire me for topics."
5,purchase of Yorktowne spoon rest,"Good product, exactly what I wanted. Very quick shipping. S & H was very reasonable. Nice experience and will do it again."
1,YAWN,I can't think what the original reviewer found in this book to give it the rateing it received. I decided to buy this because of that rateing. It was the worst thing that I read this year and I read a couple of books a week.Who picked the cover for this trainwreck? It has nothing to do with what is between the covers. He is attractive and that may be the reason right there.Save your money!
1,Boring!!!,"Having read historical romance novels for over 25 years on & off, I have read the occasional snore of a book. What really annoys me though, is when the author assumes the reader is an idiot. This is what I felt when I read this book. It was almost as though the author was bored and could not be bothered putting any endearing qualities into any of the characters.My disappointment started very early when the governess was awaiting her interview, and helped herself to the alcohol-laced punch and ended up a little tipsy. For goodness sakes, who puts alcohol-laced punch in a waiting room? Yes, okay, he was interviewing for an altogether different role but even so!!I agree with another reviewer about the cover belonging to a western contemporary rather than a historical romance.Sadly, I have not read another book from this author since reading this one."
4,He is Interviewing for a Mistress - and she is Interviewing for Governess.....,"Cheryl Holt has her own style of novels - lots of sex , innocent females, terrible men and characters of pure evil. This novel have all those characters and as a reader you fly through the pages hoping that good will out wit evil. Enjoy but I would get it at the Library!"
2,Not up to CH's normal standards,"I found this book very difficult to finish because I was so tired of the characters. I am a great fan of stories with the hero beginning as a disolute rake and then reforming, however I like my heroes intelligent, and I'm afraid I found Micheal lacking.Most rakes have redeeming qualities that draw their heroine to them. This was more like ""oh wow, your cute and I like to kiss you.... so I must love you,"" on the heroine's part. I didn't believe ethier of the character's really cared about the other. In fact the most interesting character in the book, with the most honest feelings was Alex Micheal's brother. I felt there most more to be redeemed in him than his idiot brother.I agree with a previous reviewer, go read Love Lessons if you want a hot, and entertaining read about a rake who is both sexy and intelligent."
1,Worst read of 2005,"Best part of the book was the cover. Not one likable character in the whole novel. Holt's worst novel by far. It was impossible to love Alex or Micheal. No two more selffish men have I ever come across in a book. Emily and Mary needed a good dose of self-esteem, self-worth or just maybe an introduction to the word, NO. Say no to spending your money on this novel."
3,"dissapointed, don't care","I like Cheryl Holt. I'm not ashamed. Her books are consistantly charming and funny and hot. It's just sometimes I wish that she would stretch a little. Find some new angle, some new way of presenting a story. I need something more than this book. It is the same story that she has come out with for the last 3 books. If she writes one more virginal ignorant woman in her books I will scream. She was just too simple. The hero is kind of stupid as well, so yeah I didn't really like either of the main characters. I read the book and it was OK, but I am kind of sad that I spent the money on it and didn't check it out from the library."
2,"Didn't like stupid characters, not recommended","The first lovemaking scene was very funny, but nothing else was clever or entertaining. I was annoyed with some stupid things that Michael and Emily did later in the story. SPOILER: Michael should never have trusted Amanda enough to drink what she gave him when he knew that she had recently visited and told lies to Emily. He should not have believed the lie told to him by Reginald. I hate murder mysteries where an innocent person picks up the murder weapon just as the cops arrive. The framing of Michael (being drugged and set up with Pamela) due partly due to his own stupidity reminded me of that kind of story. There were a couple of times I was bored and wanted to be done with the book. Sexual content: strong."
4,Not the best OXO has to offer,"We got this set for our wedding and also received some individual OXO utensils. Just about anything from OXO is great. It's hard to see how basic kitchen utensil design can be improved upon, but OXO has done it. That being said, the plastic on this set is not the same as the individually purchased utensils. The plastic on these is more flexible, but they were cheaper if you do the math so it makes sense. Despite this, I still think they are just fine for using in applications where metal might scratch. I use everything in the set, but sometimes I reach first for the stronger OXO ones depending on the application.If strength for really thick stirring and such is your priority, I suggest buying your pieces individually from OXO, but if you want a pretty good deal for how many utensils you get, this set is a great way to go!"
5,Softworks Tool Set 6 pc,"It has every essential you need to start cooking up some good food in your kitchen, its for the gourmet chef, right down to the country kitchen mama cook who know's what home cookin' is all about!"
4,OXO Untensils,"I received these for a shower gift. I love them, they have an excellent design, and are very comfortable to use.The only flaw is that they are kinda bulky, and with a small kitchen drawer that poses a little problem with storage."
2,Rough,The finish was very rough (only stained and not sanded and varnished afterward)and there was a bead of white glue showing around one edge at the top.
5,Great workout,"I used to do kickboxing all the time. I hadn't done it for years. I picked up this dvd at the library, and highly recommend it for intermediate to advanced. A beginner would have to review it before using it and/or learn the basics from other videos first. It did take me a few tries to do the workout perfectly, but I had fun every time. I just wish that Sherri Jacqelyn did more workouts, and I would buy them. The workout focuses most on upper body, abs, and cardio."
5,Debut?,"For the best of Craig A. check out his strks to Best Laid Plans and, especially, Romeo + Juliet. I'm about to buy this one on the basis of those two, and his rather good solo album. Swoopy and throbby - what more can one ask?"
2,"Where are Kate Bush & Peter Gabriel singing ""Don't Give Up""?","Kate Bush and Peter Gabriel sing ""Don't Give Up"" during the closing credits, yet this track is nowhere to be found on this ""Original Motion Picture Soundtrack."" Shouldn't an ""original motion picture soundtrack"" include ALL the music heard during the playing of the film? Correct me if I'm wrong...please."
2,"Great, but where are the SONGS?","Loved this movie then and after watching it again all these years later, I still do! Craig Armstrong did an awesome job on the background music, but what I was hunting the soundtrack down for were the incidental songs that were also in the movie--like ""Juicy"" by Gainde, ""Le Toucher"" by Mitsou (which apparently aren't available ANYWHERE else, not even as a download, as they were specifically written for this movie--so UGH, why didn't they put them in the soundtrack???), and ""Don't Give Up"" by Peter Gabriel. Would've given this 5 stars, but I'm so mad now! $@&#@@%!!!"
4,POWERFUL,"I saw this film, was very disappointed. But the score is by the great CRAIG ARMSTRONG. And when I heard the score separate from the film I loved it! I have all of his main work. He is a genius."
1,Sex on the prairie,"Just a tedious, rambling ""love story"" about two uninteresting people who fall in love on the prairie. My first Linda Howard book and my last."
4,1871,"I don't particularly like stories about the frontier, specially if they're set in the past, but being Linda Howard who wrote this book, i decided to try it. Man, was I glad I tried it! This story is full of unconditional love, suspense, and most important of all--the journey to discover that we're all granted more than a chance in life.""Annie Parker came to Silver Mesa, Arizona, b/c it was the only place she'd found where folks thought a woman doctor was better then no doctor at all. Her lonely life became harder still on the winter night Rafe McCay broke into her office with a bullet in his side and a bounty hunter at his back. With a gun aimed at her heart, he led her deep into the Arizona moutains, and into a world of danger and passion, for Annie doscovered Rafe not only a wounded man, but a soul betrayed...and Rafe, healed by her skill and the magic of her hands, awakened in Annie a woman's tender longing and hungry desire..."""
4,Wonderful story full of confiderate history,"I love Linda Howard. This book had the alpha guy a bit rougher than her usual guys in her other books, but I still enjoyed it. I like that the story had a bit of civil war history and such details as how everyone who knew how to use a gun, seem to know locations of veins, organs, etc."
1,Not my favorite...,"The Touch of Fire was not one of my favorite books by Linda Howard but if you like to read about kidnapping and then two people falling in love rather passionately then please, buy the book."
4,the touch of fire,"I found the cd will written, i like some of Linda Howard's books ok but this one was a little to sex filled for my taste. It seemed all the hero wanted was sex."
2,Not her best,"I love all of Linda Howard's books that I've read so far, but this book I didn't like at all. I read the book hoping that at some point I could find something positive to say about it, but didn't. I think the author was maybe confused in how to portray Annie, sometimes she was strong enough, at least to finish medicine school when all the odds were against her, and at other times she was a wimp in standing up for her life. At least I would have expected that she would fight Rafe at some point for kidnaping her. In my opinion what inspired the author to write the book was very interesting and she could have done a lot more with that kind of story. But overall I love Linda Howard so even if I'm dissapointed with some of her work I'm still going to keep reading it."
3,Nice easy read,"If you enjoy Linda Howard's books, you will enjoy this one. Nice love story with adventure thrown in. Its a good easy read."
5,One of my all time favorites!,"Excellent read about an outlaw with a dark past and a doctor woman who help heal him. She has a magical touch, but it really is the power of her love that makes him whole."
5,Great Book!,The photos are great! I just like to look and dream. Very good ideas. Great book for a Country Wedding!
5,John H,"This is a fantastic recording, and love all the cuts, but I'm still searching for a cut Bobby Scott made of ""A man of constant sorrow"". Anyone knowing where I can find it, please let me know."
4,The News as we saw it on that day,"If you want to remember what information was availible on the day the market dropped this is a great DVD. It is a collection of the ABC news broadcasts from that day. It picks up with the market close and goes through the nightly news that night. You can look at a chart to see how big the drop was and what happend over the next few weeks, but this lets you hear what was on the news that day and what people were saying on that day. Anyone can predict a drop a year or two later when we have time to put it all together, this only gives you the information that was avalible that night. It is a great reminder of what we knew at the time."
2,"Interesting, in spite of a little accuracy problem.","Most of the essays were very informative. The only problem I found was in James Campbell's essay on H. P. Lovecraft. On page 179 Campbell described the narrator of 'The Call of Cthulhu'as being nameless and insane. The narrator's name is Frances Wayland Thurston, he is dead at the time that the read sees the story. I quote from the first line of 'The Call of Cthulhu'('The Dunwich Horrors and Others' Arkham House 1984):(Found among the papers of the late Frances Wayland Thurston, of Boston)The narrator is named, and being dead, his sanity is problematical. In 1984 Arkham House printed 'The Dunwich Horror and Others"" in which this story was found. These volumes were different from what Campbell used. Campbell's essay was well written, but it should be checked against the revised text before being used for research purposes."
5,El Abate Faria,"Este es uno de los mejores libros que he leido en mi vida... Todo en el es excelente.. Es realmente maravilloso como la forma de pensar de un hombre que se cree dichoso puede llegar hasta el fondo cuando se esta encerrado en un calabozo por tantos años y separado de lo que el considera su dicha. Edmundo conoce al Abate Faria y gracias a eso comienza a pensar diferente y cuando es libre la manera en que planea y logra llevar a cabo su venganza.. Esta historia no solo da una leccion de paciencia, sino que se puede ver de que la venganza no se realiza siempre como es planeada tal como podemos ver cuando Monte-Cristo trata de revivir al hijo de Villefort..En resumen..... Excelente...."
1,No lo compre. Pésima edición,"Esta maravillosa novela ha estado siempre en mi biblioteca desde niño. Al mudarme de país perdí la edición de dos tomos que poseía y me obsequiaron esta de ""Edimat Libros, Madrid"". No la leí de inmediato sino cerca de un año después. Entonces pude percatarme de una pésima calidad de impresi'n, con partes del texto con más y menos tinta que hacen casi imposible su lectura. Esto, de por sí, habla mucho del control de calidad de la empresa, que permitió que salieran a la venta al público. Pero además, esta edición carece de los títulos de las partes y capítulos de la obra que, en mi opinión, son parte sustancial de ella. Desaconsejo gastar un centavo en esta mala edición de El Conde de Montecristo."
4,Excelente...,"Es uno de los mejores libros y una buena razón para leer los clasicos. Me recuerda a Don Quijote - y aún hace una referencia al libro - en que hay muchos temas que desarrollan en el cuento: lealdad, fe, venganza, honor y, principalmente, el libre albedrío.No hay ninguna sorpresa en el final, aunque cómo se llega al fin es muy entretenido. Es muy interesante cómo Dumas teje los cuentos dispares de los crímenes en el papel del inocente Edmond Dantés. Y aunque Edmond adopta su papel del angel vengador, aprendemos que hay nuevos principios para todos que siguen las palabras: esperar y confiar. Hay varias lecciones para muchas personas de esta època."
2,Packaging not safe for shipping,"When I received my corningware dishes, they were broken so Amazon quickly took them back but the second ones were broken too. Amazon then refunded my money."
4,I Guess it Comes Broken!,"I recieved this set as a bridal shower gift. Since I had registered for it, I was excited to open it. However, upon opening it, I was dissapointed to find out one of the dishes was broken. So I had to take it back to Target and exchange it, but once I got a good set, I found they were really nice and I love to use them!"
1,Online shipping (CorningWare Dish Set),"When I received my Corning Ware Dish Set, it was shipped in an unprotected and unpadded box. Showing the original contents to UPS. When I received this package my dishes were broken from the bottom up. There was no packing what so ever inside of or around each glass bowl or lid. Trying to find the location on the Target site to print a receipt and confirmation to return items, was not an easy task. I order a large sum of products VIA the Internet and this was the worst instance of poor shipping in my 4 year experience of network shopping.Jenny DysonBakersfield, Ca."
2,Inspect immediately!,"My mother bought me this online--the contents weren't so much corningware as shattered. She returned it, and later my friend's mother bought it for me. It was also shattered. I took it back to the store and went through three boxes before I found one that was intact. Beware!"
1,Disappointing,"Maybe I'm mad, because my shipment arrived with several broken pieces, or maybe because the replacement shipment ALSO arrived with several broken pieces, but I was really disappointed in this CorningWare and target for not shipping it more carefully, and have given up on having any more CorningWare shipped to me."
3,corning ware 10-pc set,"Disappointed. Although it cooks/bakes well and is attractive, it is not easy to grasp and hold. It is very difficult to transfer as a hot item from the oven. There are no side grips or handles to hold to support the pieces. It is too clummsy with handling, especially if both the lid and bowl are hot. I would not purchase it again nor give it as a gift. The price was reasonable, and although it was received with a broken bowl, it was replaced without any hassle and to full satisfaction. I am comparing this to a set of corning ware that I have had since 1968, and the old set is the best for my personal use."
2,Not that great,"These dishes, first of all, are just beautiful. The white looks so wonderful on the table and the presentation is just fabulous. That said, be prepared to buy and buy and buy these if you like the looks of them. They break horribly easily and the cleanup, well, we just won't go there. I've had mine for 10 years and now I'm down to just two of the serving pieces. They break very easily in the oven, in the cabinet, you name it, it's gone. If you're looking for a better one, go for the Le Creuset La Poterie line, or just grab a Longaberger one. They're definitely worth it because you'll just have to keep buying these to keep them looking good and in one piece. I hate trying to clean these after using them so I just don't use them anymore for anything but to mix items. That way, nothing gets baked on them and I am not breaking nails scouring off the mess. I definitely recommend getting something else."
1,it breaks in the oven!,"I bought this, that says its oven safe... and the first day I put it up to the task... it breaks!how is that? my food ended with shattered glass... everywhere..So now I just use it to serve cold dishes on the table... its totally useless...Thats it :)"
1,Another broken item story,"I thought a lot of the reviews here were exaggerated about shipping and broken merchandise . . . until my set arrived with two broken items. Also, despite what the web site says, there are stickers on every item saying none of them should be used on the stovetop or under a broiler. Very disappointing from my favorite store."
3,Broken,"I got this set as a wedding gift, only to find that the bottom dish was broken. I read a review about this already and just can't understand why they can't pack it better than they do. You would think for the price of this item, the least they could do is pack it good. Otherwise, wonderful product."
1,Is it really OK for broiling,We just purchased the Corningware 5 piece set with the 1.5 and 2.5 Qt casserole dishes from a store. When we got home we noticed a warning on the box that it was not for broiler use.Is this set safe for broiler use ?
4,Remixes are sometimes better than the originals.....,"I love this album and have for many years. This is a great album to have if you are a true R&B fan. If you like the more 'bubble gum' Boys II Men songs, you may not enjoy this one. The remixes of ""I'll Make Love to You,"" and ""Uhh Ahh"" far surpass the originals. This is some good baby-making music!"
4,better than the Album Versions,this Remix Collection to me is better overall than the mostly Polished Album Versions you hear on there albums.they are Really Good Vocalists but they are also only as Good as the Writing&Production teams they have worked with but this Set adds some life to there past songs.
1,Afraid for buyers,"I purchased what I thought were ""deals"" from 2 seperate vendors and was very disappointed.To get a pair of decent fitting sweats, you have to pay the price, and you won't regret it.I hope this advice helps."
2,"This isn't the Autumn that made the album ""The Hating Tree""","There are several bands with the name Autumn. Amazon doesn't do a good job of separating them. This is not the same band that made the albums ""The Hating Tree"" and ""Return to the Breath""."
2,Nothing special,"Not impressed by this oostume, I purchased from a third party seller, and they stink- literaly. There was this stench when I opened my mail box, a odd odor but I didnt think to much about it. Then I got home and opened my package, the smell was obviously coming from my costume, it stunk so bad I had to keep it in the garage. After washing twice the smell is gone. Not the highest quality costume I thought it would fall apart in the wash but it didnt. Probably the last time I buy from a third party seller unless they offer free returns."
3,3.5 stars,"I heard how ?uestlove was saying that this was a classic and all that, so I finally got around to purhcasing it the other day. I don't know if there's something wrong with me or what, but this album isn't capturing me all too much like all of these other reviewers. It's nice and laid-back, but some of the songs just don't have melodies and production that catch my attention. Some of the songs are also very repetitive. Not a classic to me.I began listening to their sophomore effort, The Tortoise and the Hare, today and it is much better, in my opinion."
4,Get this NOW!,"I purchased this CD almost three years ago and have not regretted it since. This is a MUST have for any R&B/Neo-Soul fan. I picked it up on the recommendation of Tower Records on the Avenue of the Arts in Philadelphia. One of the best CD's to come along in a long while. Their second CD, The Tortoise and the Hare, is even better IMO, but this is a solid debut. Get it NOW!"
4,MELLO SMOOTH,"I PICKED UP THIS CD ON A HUNCH AND I'M GLAD I DID. THE BEATS ARE ""MELLO SMOOTH"" WITH A MIXTURE OF JAZZ AND SOUL. THE LYRICS ARE SO-SO AND THE VOCALS LEAVE A LITTLE TO BE DESIRED, BUT ALL IN ALL THIS IS A COOL ALBUM. THIS ALBUMS IS PERFECT FOR A DAY CHILLING WITH THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE. DEFINITELY WORTH THE PURCHASE!"
3,Not as Good As I Thought It Would Be,"Although this album is one of the better neo-soul albums in a time of lousy, non-talented so called ""artists,"" it doesn't do enough in the rhythm section. It's a good thing that the songs have meaning and aren't just about sex and having material possessions. However, it is imperative for the music to be a little better and a little more spontaneous. Nearly every song is sang in the same key and 70% of the songs have almost the exact same beat. Singing of this nature consists of two parts: the actual singing and the music. The singing is good, but could use some variation, but the music is almost too subtle. I nearly fell asleep listening to some of the rhythms. And, this was not because they were hypnotic, but because they were boring and had no variation. Overall, this is an OK project, but nothing that overly excites a true musician. If you were to purchase this album, I recommend buying the cassette: it will be a little cheaper ... .-Peace-"
2,Jazzy and Nasty but not Phat,"I jumped on this CD after hearing the track ""The Wound"". I ain't gon' front, the sisters can sang all day every day but a lead singer in the group - I don't think so. The CD has vision in the songs but is missing that true lead singing on tracks that will take them over the top.Favorite tracks:2. How Sad 3. Breakthrough 4. Unconventional Ways"
4,Smooth,"These women have such beautiful voices. A little hip hop, funk, jazz. For some reason the vocal harmony reminds me a little of Zhane on a couple of songs. This is a distinct and creative project. Another cd for the music lovers."
5,Incredible,"This is one of the best CD's I've bought all year. Incredible blend of jazz, hip-hop and soul. It's a must-have!"
5,The Return of Real R&B,"With the music world starting to sound alike (rappers talking about guns, jewelry, cars and r&b singers talking about sleeping with someone's love thang), it was good to finally get a CD that was pleasing. I took a chance on this and I'm glad. The Jazzyfatnastees will probably not get their due props but they can sing, the production is tight and the lyrics speak to nations. I'd recommend this to everyone."
1,R.S.V.P. CHZ-BL Cheese Slicer,The blade is flimsy. You are better off using a knife than this particular device.
5,cheese slicer,I had to wait awhile for this to be shipped as this item was out of stock. It was well worth the wait. I love my cheese slicer with the blade instead of a wire.
5,Great!,"Great little cutter. I use it everyday for cheese and sausage, also. Cuts evenly and easily. Don't know how I managed without it! Even bought some for gifts."
2,A term paper on an event in Soviet naval history,"I heard that this book was an account of a true story about a mutiny in the Soviet navy that became the basis for Tom Clancy's first hit ""The Hunt for Red October."" Technically this is true. However, be warned that the number of pages devoted to appendicies and footnotes exceeds the number devoted to the mutiny. This is an academic biography of the political officer mutineer -- his history, his beliefs, something of the mutiny, and the political response that is as documented as it is boring. If you are looking for this type of information, the auther did a good job --it probably rates 4 stars. However, if you are looking for a sea story, you've been warned."
4,An excellent contemporary description of small town India,"The author has done a great job with his subject matter. An eye opener for anyone who wants a true taste of how the majority of Indians live-- not just the metropolitans and the ""National Geographic"" rural Indians...Great Job on his first!!"
5,Inspiring...,"This is the third installment in the moonshine conspiracy series, and possibly the best. Threads together a series of moving, inspiring stories, with good footage, all under the auspices of renting out a shack in Oz with your buddies and surfing empty peaks, and shaping boards. Not your typical surf ""hack and attack"" 30 minute montage, but will probably get you more amped for a lifetime of surfing and surf culture. Makes you proud to be a part of the sport and way of life. check it out, I highly recommend it. Especially if you liked thicker than water, september sessions, or brokedown melody. Oh, and did I mention a great soundtrack-->Mason Jennings, Jon Swift, White Buffalo, etc."
2,A very difficult book to read,"This a textbook for a class that is interested in doing teacher research into literacy practices in classrooms. Even at that, I would say only about half the chapters in this book would be of any real practical use."
4,Can't help but be impressed,"While I didn't find this CD quite to the peak level of the Boys Air Choir Requiem, it is in its own way moving and impressive work. These are dedicated and focused young performers led by someone hardly older than themselves but gifted with the ability to organize, direct, and feel the music. It was, however, the work of a developing artist more than a tested one, taking it to, in my opinion, occasional excess. I can live with such a flaw because it promises much for the future."
4,Soothing music,"It's too bad BAC aren't making music anymore; they were kind of the Menudo of choir music. Beautiful voices and harmonies, very soothing. Edward Burrowes really shines here."
5,Wonderful ring.,This ring was bought for a man that has graced many book covers. He was very pleased with it.
3,"Great set, wrong size","The Felpro Valve Cover set was complete and arrived promptly. However, when it came time to install on my '94 Accord, a vehicle which the ""Amazon Part Finder"" swore this would be the correct size for, none of the parts came close to fitting correctly. The valve cover gasket was way too long and the spark plug protectors were way off. I would strongly recommend double checking the correct size for your vehicle."
5,A Review of The Art of Pointework--Level 2 by Finis Jhung,"This DVD is an excellent aide for beginning students of pointe, regardless of age. It begins with some easy stretches that provide a safe warm-up for the feet and ankles, and then quickly moves to a series of plies and releves, which emphasize the importance of smooth rolling foot movements, and correctly positioning the entire body for balance. As the video proceeds, the exercises grow progressively more challenging, demanding increased speed, coordination, and foot muscle strength. This DVD includes both barrework and center floor work, and I found its explanations and illustrations to be extremely helpful."
1,Amazon screwing up???,I ordered this 512MB video card and received a 256MB version of the card. I sent it back immediately for a replacement; one month later I get ANOTHER 256MB version of this card.Be wary - there may be a bug or wrong number in their system somewhere.
4,Fun for Kids,Clifford's Family is a fun book for kids to read when they are just starting to read. It is interesting and exciting. The illustrations are very detailled. The author is Norman Bridwell. I would recamend this book to read to your little brother or sister before thet go to bed!
4,"set expectations properly, look for closeouts","this is definitely a low-end photo frame, and costs like it. this is no equal for frames costing $200-400.similar models to the smartpants are often available at closeout prices, this frame is also known as the gigaexpo p350 and radio shack digital photo frame 63-1078 (discontinued).this frame has significant limitations. the biggest issue for most people is in the jpeg decoding. there is a program available from willus.com/archive called rsdpv.exe that will resize your images and use the proper jpeg encoding and naming scheme to make the viewer happy.the angle of view could be better, and i'm told that the tv video output is terrible so don't bother.but for a budget frame at a budget price, if your expectations are set properly, this is a nice little unit."
1,Awsome now that i found rsdpv.exe before that it sucked,"MAKE SURE YOU download rsdpv.exe or the pictures you load into it will not work! radio shack should have thought of this. ""youve got questions they got no answers"""
1,Worthless product,"I bought this item for my husband for Christmas and after purchasing a memory card for this item, we were unable to view the pictures. I called the company that manufactures this product and they were clueless about how to help. They passed me around to a few people who actually said that ""this is a new product and we don't really know how to fix problem."" I was outraged. This was a waste of money and a lot of time trying to get the pictures to show up!"
5,Of all the books on the Eucharist...,"Having been studying the eucharist, this book was a triumph! I had difficulty getting a copy in the UK so it was the last I read of the suggested reading list at college. Very good on the historicity of the eucharist and of the development of traditions. Eminently readable - for a theologian Macy had a 'common touch' when writing. Many theological books are best kept for periods of insomnia - I read this one in the same way I eat chocolate - always ready for the next bit! Buy it, lend it, but make sure it comes back to you. It's a book I will look at often. (And not bad for sermon material either!)"
3,VERY PRICEY,"This is a LOT of money for #2 Cable and plug-in connector that has been designed for use with only other proprietory Warn connectors. It can be modified with a Dremel tool to accept other less expensive connectors of equal of better quality, but do not have the Warn name on them nor equivalent expense associated with the name. Also, 20' of cable is a bit long for a CJ-7 from Bats to the rear of the veh., so will require cutting the cable, soldering, and re-installation of cable ends.....Just be forwarned my friends.."
5,perfect cleaver,"so easy to use, fits in my hand comfortably and rests on the board well... beautiful design Elegant and practical"
2,Flawed Sound,"Well, the performances are great, but there's something seriously wrong with the sound. At first I assumed it was one of those early CDs with pre-emphasis, a process that raises the treble to ungodly levels that are corrected with a CD player (but most CD players today don't detect or correct it, because it was so rare and fell out of fashion).But this CD was remastered in 2003, and the high frequencies still sound like nails on a chalkboard. Either the recording was lousy (unlikely) or somebody botched the remastering job (not unlikely). Unfortunate."
5,Classic lesson in computer science,This simple kids' book contains important computer science lessons relating to databases and authoritative data sources. It also raises sociological questions about the impact of information technology on decision-making in complex organizations. A must-read for anyone interested in computing or the social impact of computers.
4,A Good Solid Reference for the Practicing Designer,"This book is a good solid reference for the designer of mechanical shock, vibration and noise isolation mounting systems. Although more than a handbook it is not a typical text book with formal derivations for all the standard problems. It contains a wealth of information based on years of research and design experience.The author comes from a background which exposed him to a variety of types and compositions of elastomeric isolators and US Navy standard mounts, NATO mounts, various types of standard steel and customized spring mounts, cable mounts, and the design of isolation mounting systems in general. I have spent the better fraction of my 40 years in mechnical engineering working at least part time designing passive shock and vibration isolation systems and consider this book a useful addition to my reference library."
1,"copper ""encapsulated"" NOT copper clad","These pots are worse than useless. The instruction leaflet that comes with the pots states:""Never let cookware boil dry or use on high heat. Products with Tri-Ply/aluminum disc/or encapsulated bottoms may melt/separate.""I tried frying some falafels, and sure enough, the copper bottom started to seperate from the pan. Same thing happened to another pot when I inadvertantly let some broccoli boil dry. Also in the manual it says that if bottom of pan melts/seperates, DO NOT USE AGAIN.I've enjoyed years of use out of my Revere copper clad cookware, but after only a couple weeks several of my new copper encapsulated pots and pans are ready for the landfill. I am very dissapointed."
3,Good but not the best,i have to say i love paul revere pots and pans and these are nice ones indeed. But the only complaint that I have is the handles get hot! they review states stay cool handles.....so not true! i nearly burnt my hand of. Watch out and be aware! use an ove mit or something. other than that they work for me.
1,Don't buy this book if your looking for Mac Programming,"This book does not show you anything about macintosh programming or anything mac specific. I refer those looking for a mac programming book to go check out ""Foundations of Mac Programming"". It's a bit dated and the projects aren't compatable w/ the new codewarrior but it's worth it"
4,A great first step for beginning programmers.,"This is a great book for those looking to learn the C programing language. It is aimed at those using a Mac, but really could be read by anyone as it teaches almost entirely platform-independent ANSI C.As for teaching ANSI C it does a great job and makes most concepts easy to understand by relating them to the real world. This is definitely a good book for the beginner, but if you already know C this book isn't for you.Its title is also somewhat misleading. While it does teach you C *ON* the Macintosh, it doesn't teach you Macintosh C. That is, it barely even mentions the Mac toolbox, which is used to program every Macintosh program in existence. Aside from that fact, and since you really need to know the C language before touching the toolbox, it's a great first step."
2,Ok for beginners.,I learned the basics of ANSI C from this book when I was twelve. What I remember not liking about it was how it skipped material to make things easier to understand. Very bad if you plan to learn more about programming for the Macintosh.
3,"A good for beginners, but not for starting in Mac.","I've found this book a good introduction to C, it has refreshed my forgotten c knowledges with good explanations and examples.But I haven't learned about Mac programming. Just one chapter and not in a depth way."
4,Pretty good starting place,"There is a new (February 2005) edition of this book available as a PDF from Spiderworks. It's an update for OS X, using the XCode software that comes free with OS X. Otherwise, the book is unchanged, including a few minor errors carried through from the 1995 edition. I don't know of any other resource for learning C on the Mac, but I don't hesitate to recommend it. It could use more programming exercises; I recommend supplementing it with Oualline's ""Practical C Programming"". After you've done this, read the ObjectiveC primer that comes with XCode and use a Cocoa programming book by Hillegas or Anguish."
2,Quasi-helpful book,"I have to admit, this book was very good at teaching me the concepts of programming (structures, pointers, variables, algorithm design, etc) but for learning the C language it was terrible. Very little Macintosh programming is covered at all, it's just the dry ANSI C. Needless to say, I did not know how to program after using this book. However, it was a useful guide (albeit a bit confusing at times) to learning the basics of programming."
5,The greatest book!,"Now this is what a programming book for the mac is supposed to be! From the beginning this book takes you on a tour introducing you to the mac and how to program it, with useful source code and good exsamples.The only minor about this book is the fact it`s nearly 6 years old, but it`s not a big problem. It`s well written, and I can absolutely recommend it to everyone."
4,What a hoot!,"I don't think I'd appreciate this collection if it wasn't for the Moskau video on YouTube. If you haven't seen it, do a search on that site for Moskau and you'll see them in all their glory.The first CD has some of the faster songs, the second is a bit little slower. Even if you don't speak a word of German, it's fun to try and sing along while breaking the sound barrier in your car.I don't buy many CDs any more, but this one was totally worth it.FYI. This CD is made in Germany. I don't know if I'm the only one to experiance this problem, but the plastic jewel cases from Europe tend to explode when you open them the first time. (The hinge shatters and the plastic knobs in the center you use to secure the CD went flying everywhere) It happened with a couple of Russian CDs I bought before this at local ethnic stores, so I don't know if it's someone who makes them over there or if it happens in transport to America, but be warned about that."
3,I was hoping for so much more,"This album left me pretty disappointed. After hearing ""The Rocking Son of Dschinghis Khan,"" ""Oh Miguel"" (both not on this album), ""Moskau"" and ""Loreley,"" I was pretty sure that this album would be awesome. Maybe it will grow on me, but as of yet I'm just not wowed by it like I was expecting to be."
4,Check It Out,"I found this to be the most complete and readable book I have found, but, I have not gone through a lot of the points yet. It is a very large book and I am behind in my genealogy progress because of the holidays."
1,School and Library binding edition is defective,"The hardbound School and Library binding book I received had very poor registration and cropping. Images and text were cropped off, some pages at the top and other pages at the bottom. I recommend the standard soft cover edition."
5,"Looks like a little book, but so much more!","When you see this book in the box it looks like a single story book, but when you open its pages you find a treasury of multiple stories of manners. The illustrations are great and the book is typical Richard Scarry. Such a reminder of his books from my childhood."
5,Great for little ones,"This book presents manners in a fun and familiar context for little readers. My kids already love Huckle and Lowly, so it was easy for them to enjoy this book. My favorite story is Pig Will and Pig Won't. At my house, we need constant reminders on good manners, and this book makes it fun. Parents will enjoy it too."
4,cute,"My daughter likes this book a lot, and it is fun to read and look at, though she hasn't yet learned to say please and thank you!"
3,To Save for Toddler to Pre-School Years,"Since it's difficult to get children to sit and read often, this book is a bit difficult without ""real-life"" situations and examples, so whenever I take my child out, I always try my best to make sure that she hears me say ""please"" and ""thank-you"" so she will learn those niceties as well as other cultural assistance that will make her a young lady throughout life even if life often doesn't accommodate. This book will be put up until she is ready for the harder concepts of visualization, until she can put reality together with the written word, but it is a WINNER!!!"
5,A must for children!,"My children had this same book. Call me 'nostalgic', but I simply had to buy this book for my Granddaughter, age 3, also. I have always loved all Richard Scarry book and love the animals he illustrates, espeically Lowly Worm! :)"
3,Something is missing...,"I expected that book to be step-by-step instruction. Generally it is, but some things are missing: how to calculate order points, alert (red level); THERE IS NOTHING ABOUT HEIJUNKA - production leveling - there are only 3-4 sentences which tell you that it might be a problem if your Customer order more than +/ 20% - it's not enough! KANBAN will kill any company without heijunka (sometimes very slow but painfully/costly).CD - waste of time (as it was already written)."
3,Good BUT,"Book is well organized. Chapters 3 (Data Collection) and 4 (Sizing the Kanban)need more detail. Overall, the book does take you through the process. CD is a waste of time. All the files are in PDF format. If these were in Word or Excel, it would be much easier to use."
5,A tasty treat!,"These kippered snacks (herrings) are a great way to add Omega 3 fatty acids to your diet. Each 3.5 oz. can contains 1.4 gms of Omega 3. This fish is an excellent source of protein as well (18 gms per can). The smoked flavor is just right and it seems to combat any fishiness. I only wish that they had less sodium (460 mg per can) and I am wondering what sodium hexametaphosphate is. Most of our family likes them including our 18-year-old son. Our dog loves them and the liquid in the can. The fish are meaty with a good solid texture and there is very little liquid in the can. I like them with cold pickled beets and cheese souffle, a meal that I grew up with and am now enjoying once again after many years. They are at Dollar Tree for $1 per can right now."
3,Good but Shipping is too high,Pros* Foldable* Portable* Great solution for keeping a dog fed and watered on the goCons* The shipping is double the product cost?
2,Annoying visuals in transitional passages,"I have purchased this together with ELP's Pictures at an exhibition, released by the same company. It may be a little dangerous to generalize over merely two items, but the video effects added to these DVDs are very annoying. Although these 'effects' in this release are restricted to the transitional orchestral passages with narration, but I still feel uncomfortable. Narration itself is definitely not a top-class, compared to the original recording."
4,Revisiting an old friend,"I first read this book in San Miguel d'Allende in Mexico in the early 1970s, where Pierre Delattre was living at the time. Then I found it enchanting, funny and profoundly moving. All of us writers and would-be writers who gathered to drink at Los Dragones (a bar in the main square, or jardine, of San Miguel) envied Pierre the fact that he was published, and had written such a great book. Long ago I lost my copy so I was delighted to find it republished by Lost Horse Press. A new reading only confirmed my earlier opinion; it is a masterful piece of writing that contains great wisdom and great humor."
1,Worst book ever,"If you really want >1000 pages that literally tell you the three ways to save a table/query/form every time you finish a task, then this book is for you. (Besides, when hasn't Access prompted you to save a table?) The instructions are fluff and filled with useless information, and as far as I can tell they don't approach the real theory of database design. Don't expect to learn the tools necessary to build your own database, rather you learn how to construct their one example without the theory to apply it elsewhere. This is bang your head against the table stupid, folks."
1,"Repetitive, Wordy, Brainless walk-throughs, Mistakes!!!","I agree with every negative comment about this book. I have learned a few scripting languages, programming languages, and other technologies from the instruction of well written text. This book makes me constantly wonder if there was some monatary motivation for adding thousands of words that were completely unneeded. Do the authors get paid more when they hand the publisher a text with a 10,000 words rather than 5,000? Did the Wiley publishing company think that a ""Bible"" that was a couple inches skinnier was just not as credible. It's very hard to learn from with all of the extremely repetitive child-like explanations! There are also a lot of mistakes. ????!!!!"
4,Good reference,"I have to say that this book is a good helped for somebody that doesn't know much about Access. I bought the book to help create a database and overall I'm glad I did. The only think I didn't like is the way the book was organized. I find it quite chaotic and lots of things repeat themselves in different parts of the book. Apart from trying to find what I was looking for, the information in the book is priceless for a general public user."
3,"In response to ""Why are these books so wordy?""","yeah, there are word specifications and the publisher holds you to them, so if you're to create a manuscript of not less than 450 pages and you've said what you need to say in 200, you start scrambling, generating symbols, call outs, notes of various kinds, repeating basic instructions each time you do a process. It's a function of the desire by the book-buying public to buy a hernia-inducing book while the skimpier, better organized, tighter, better book next to it will gather dust. So it's really all your fault. After all, which book did YOU buy? And it isn't 10,000 vs 5,000, it's like 25,000 versus 100,000. And you generally get three weeks to create that book, using beta software. It's literally pounding the keys dawn to midnight to the exclusion of meals, bathing, beer, and television. Often for an advance of three thousand dollars."
3,Good content but full of errors,"This book is OK but I think QUE's one is better. It is full of errors, I'm not sure anyone went over it before publishing."
5,Best Access 2003 book,"Only Access book to adequately cover HTML Help integration. I have a library of Access 2002 books. When I wanted one to cover 2003, this was the one I chose. I hope future versions will continue to include thorough treatment of Help projects."
3,Not as good as you might think,"I have had ""Bibles"" of the last 3 versions of Access. I was disappointed with the earlier versions in that they did not go into macros and VBA as much as I wanted. I was overjoyed that this version does, but found many problems. All the books in the ""Bible"" series have problems with proofing. There are too many typos. Even a section on spell check in this book had the wrong words entered for the spell check. The bigger problem is with the examples provided on the CD. Some files are missing in the chapters. And the coding does not always work. I tried to program a personal project using a much-needed procedure and could not get it or my lesson to work. What a surprise - the completed project that was provided on the CD did not work either. Wiley needs to proof and test more before going to press. Also a little too high level for beginner Access users - assumes that the average user understands the VBA terms and their applications."
3,"Well designed, stable on the table top","I've used other collapsible plastic water containers over the years when camping. This product solves the problem of the container wanting to roll off of the table or bench, especially when full. The integrated handle makes this container easier to support when filling, and to carry when full.Updated 2012-07-09:After only a few uses, I noticed that a leak had developed in the cap. Closer inspection revealed that the thin white rubber gasket in the cap, that seals against the lip of the jug, had shifted and folded over a bit, causing the leak. I moved the gasket back to its original position and that fixed the leak, until the gasket shifted again. The gasket seems a bit too small for the purpose.Due to the leak problem, I'm changing my rating from 5 stars to 3 stars."
4,Works well,"No, it doesn't pack small. But, it's light, holds a good amount of water, is cheap and doesn't leak. It does everything you could ask."
2,"It's okay, but...","It's not the solution to my never ending quest for a proper water container. This seems to be better than the ""bag carton"" plastic ones, also made by Coghlan's and Coleman, and uses the same poor spout. However, this one has the problem that it's unruly in other ways... It does store fairly flat, but when filled, doesn't really have a good way to rest or stand, and just lays there on the table."
2,"Solid, but gives the water a plastic taste","I got this with the hopes of using it for a rather casual camping trip. I didn't need anything fancy, just something that could pack down lighter as it was used up. To test it out i filled it up with water and left it alone for 3 days (the time i'd be camping for). Unfortunately, when i went to taste the water, i found it had a definite plastic taste."
3,"Seems sturdy, doesn't smell like gross plastic","This came in the mail yesterday. It arrived quicker than I thought it would. It doesn't smell like some kind of disgusting cheap plastic like the other collapsible bottle that I purchased does. It looks like it's built well, although it is pretty big and bulky. Not recommended for backpacking / hiking as it's too big. Not sure if it leaks yet."
4,Great for emergency kit,"It appears sturdy and easy to use. I have not had a chance to use it,and hope not too as it is part of my emergency back pack that's why I gave it 4 not 5 stars to be fair. I had read reviews that noted that the 2 gallon size is best, as heavy as it may be when filled, it is said to be more manageable and useful than larger or smaller sizes. Hope this reviews help you."
3,okay,"This game is okay, it doesn't add in a lot of different new things into the game... If they do a new expansion pack I hope they reduce the stress level for all the actors since they get so stressed so easily."
5,Aware records rocks,"Aware Records puts out a compilation each year featuring the best unsigned rock acts in the nation, many of whom go on to become major label bands with hits left and right. Past artists on the compilation have been Vertical Horizon, matchbox twenty, Edwin McCain, Five For Fighting, John Mayer, the Vervepipe, Hootie and the Blowfish. Aware 7 is an amazing album with the highlights being Wayne, Gus, and the Gufs (with Rob Thomas on back up vocals). I reccommend this disc and all the others too. Aware 8 should be coming out soon... Aware rocks!"
3,Basic but behind the times,A good book introductory book when it was published but does not contain the latest information. Shimek has written subsequent introductory book with additional information.
2,Diehards' disc,"Collectors determined to possess every note Stitt recorded may appreciate this set for Sonny's spoken and sung (!) contributions, distorted as they are. But neither the quality of the music (despite Sonny's familiar facility on his horns) nor the sound (mixing is non-existent) justifies more than a single listening, if that. Given the amateurish quality of the audio production, the professional quality of the packaging is almost remarkable. But a Cracker Jack ring in a box from Tiffany's is still a Cracker Jack ring.This album might make sense if it contained the only extant recordings by Buddy Bolden, and even then it would not be worth the asking price."
5,Great,Practial guide to reading CT images. Great for both Physician and Technologist. Tastes great too!
4,"Great price, big, 30 pound roll","As the prior review says, this comes in one big roll. Weighs 30 pounds, in a big heavy plastic bag and packed in a box. The roll is a bit cumbersome to work with given it's size, if you're using it to wrap bushes as we were. We stuck a broom handle through the tube and that helped a bit. Product is bound on one edge, but the other edge unravels quite a bit, more that the small rolls made by Dupont that we've bought at Lowe's before. However, for the equivalent 250 feet, this is 30% cheaper not counting the sales tax I didn't have to pay. And since burlap is biodegradeable, getting one big role in a bag is much better than 10 small rolls in 10 bags :)."
5,Great for winter protection!,The best buy anywhere....this was perfect to fence my front walk of hydrangeas and protect them from winter kill of cold Ohio winters!
4,works well,What else can I say... used it to wrap plants. It did not rip during the winter. Cutting it was easy too.
2,Fit was only so so,"It protrudes from the wall further than other switch plates. Also, once it is on the wall it is not easily removed."
1,Not for the professional,"This book is supposed to be for the professional, however, it is more geared towards the layperson. It has good content but not for the professional. I truly wasted my money on this one."
3,The Ever-Changing Steve,This is an interesting disk in that it's mood keeps evolving and this particular millenium collection won't let you down except I noticed some distortion.My interest was mainly in Steve's earlier recordings and there are many that didn't make this compilation. Buy this because it's important. Three stars.
1,Poor quality...not the best selection...,"Not worth the cost. Very poor quality sound. Not really a collection with any cohesiveness. Save your cash, or spend your money on his ""About Time"", if you don't already have it -- that one is absolutely excellent, and the production quality is near perfect."
1,"OH, NO, NO NO NO NO NO!","If you're an 80's kind of guy and you remember this guy here,""Talking Back To The Night,Valerie"", BUY CHRONICLES and skip this piece of history. I am usually a big fan of the 20th Century masters collection, not this time. CHRONICLES..Go look at it now!"
1,Poorly Researched,"I'm in complete agreement with Kenneth Cash. The perpetuation of Herndon's inaccurrate information is inexcusable. I would simply like to add that along with Cash's list of excellent authors of Lincoln, I would include Joe Wheeler and James M. McPherson. McPherson's book, in particular (""Tried by War""), would be a better study of Lincoln than Burlingame's book!"
5,Replacement pieces,"I have had a set of these dishes for over 12 years. I have broken a few and wanted to replace them. I found out they still make these dishes with a different vendor. I could not see any difference between vendors. Great replacement for what I had missing. If you have this set, then these replacement bowls are great..."
4,matches the set I have,I got this because we broke a bowl from the set we got years ago. It matches the set and I am happy.
5,Great Bowls,"Great bowls, I have had the Flora pattern for years but did not have any cereal bowls.These match well and are a good size, however a little small for cereal. Good for fruit, or snacks and small bits of cereal. Microwave and dishwasher safe a good quality thatmatches my Dansk."
5,Love these little cereal bowls,"Well, I've purchased several of these along the time, and that tells you that I'm happy with them. They are a bit small as a cereal bowl, but so many uses I find and they are very attractive. A very good quality that Dansk puts out."
5,Princess booster car seat,"My granddaughters were delighted with the new Princess car seats, I feel good knowing they will remain in them and safe. The service was excellent they were received by them the next day. I had a very positive experience. Thanks"
5,Big fan of the Graco TurboBooster Seats,"This is our third Graco TurboBooster seat... I bought two for my twins a couple years ago. When they outgrew the backs i saved them and this time i just bought a base for my youngest daughter. She was thrilled to get one with the ""Princesses"" on it! and the back from the older ones just snapped in place. These are great, easy to use, adjustable, the cup holders are handy. Easy to clean... I have nothing bad to say about them at all"
2,Less than expected...,"Being a novice clicker trainer I read just about everything I can find that might be relevant. Unfortunately Deb Jones' workbook adds very little to the available literature. It provides some useful information but at a very low ""density"". It could have been condensed to a small booklet and published/distributed for a fraction of the price. Other sources (books by Morgan Spector, Karen Pryor, booklets and video by Gary Wilkes, Internet resources, others) are much more informative."
5,yes for ear wax candles,"My son went in for a physical to his pediatrician. All was fine, except the doctor exclaimed over how much ear wax he had and wanted to extract it. I said no, I will use ear wax candles. He advised me they do not work, they dangerous, etc. I had to return to the office the next day for another reason and so, after ""treating"" my son with a candle, brought him the next day. The doctor looked into his ear and saw NOTHING, it was totally clear. He turned and looked at me: what did you do? I used ear wax candles I said. He just shook his head....."
1,"Amazon must think my ears are filthy, they charged me for two.","Why have one when you can have two at twice the price? That's the motto around Amazon these days. Order one, get charged for two. This is not the first time, check out my other reviews to see what other goodies Amazon likes to double you down on."
4,Chico has got it going on!,"The album is good. It's not like the first one but there are some really great songs such as Sexual...that one is the bomb! Overall, I enjoy listening to it!"
4,Chico's Amazing,"Chico's Cd, The Game is truly amazing. I love all the songs on the album but most of all i really enjoy listening to Everybody Knew But Me and Your Way, those two are my favorite cuts. But dont get me wrong all the songs are wonderful. I give it 4 stars because its not as good as Long Time No See. Now that album was TRULY BUMPIN'.But The Game is definitly worth buying. I would have liked it if he had the lyrics in the album but anyway the songs are great for love making, resting etc."
4,"Chico's album is mature, sexy and just plain hot!","At first glance one my see chico as just eye candy, some hot puerto-rican pretty-boy with a street-wise point of view. However after listening to his sophomore effort, Chico's truly solidifies himself as a bonifide artist of the new millenium. Yes, he is very attractive but he is also very emotional and sincere in his lyrics. I would liken him to an urban Stevie Wonder. Some may disagree with this statement but one listen to this album and they too may be dissuaded. Enjoy Chico's second effort because it is truly inspiritional!"
3,A Dissapointment,"As soon as I left the store I popped this CD in...and found myself pressing 'fast forward' time & time again. ""The Game"" starts strong, but then goes downhill -- Chico does try to redeem himself at the end though. There ARE some good songs on here, but others are downright boring, and some just have corny lyrics. I think that if you like ""Long Time No See"" for it's unique soulful sound you may be dissapointed. I was expecting this CD to be different from the 1st, but at times Chico sounds like too many of the other male soloists on the radio (the ballads are boring and he overuses those Timbaland-style beats). I suggest listening to some of the CD (not just the 1st few tracks) before you buy it."
4,"A well rounded cd, summtin u can listen 2 all da way through","I enjoyed all the tracks on this album. I am looking foward to his new cd ""free"". This man is a unique individual that can set the mood for u and ur speacial someone. I would recommend this cd to all people that like neo soul, cause this is one of the better cd's out thur. So enjoy and keep supporting beautiful music..."
2,"Without El, Chico loses the soul of 'Long Time No See'.","I'm sure The Game will sell, but only by appealing to a lower denominator. Corny lyrics and annoying ad-libs at times make you want to tell Chico to shut up..he hasn't got the soul he thinks he has. Without his brother El's production, I realise what made 'Long Time No See' so satisfying... Sadly Chico has jumped on the bandwagon with Timberland-esque beats that seldom work. Three good tracks, but I want my cream back."
4,Good Background,"After seeing the movie, The Conspirator, I wanted a little more information regarding the trial and the times - and this book delivered. Now I see what a travesty her execution was."
4,Great Listening!,"Great piece of listening. It was kind of a sad way to end the great series, but I love the movie and the music is great, too!!"
1,What A Bore!,"It you want to read about practically nothing going on in London in the 1500s except a few dedails here and there from one of Catherine the Queen's maids, Estrella de Montoya, THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU. Do NOT expect to learn anything or be entertained."
1,Disappointing,"I didn't even bother to finish this book and skipped some of the chapters. Basically, it jumps back and forth in history from before Catherine married Henry VIII and their divorce. There was nothing about WHEN they were actually married. Furthermore, the book should have been titled ""The Spanish Maid of Honor: A Novel of Estrella de Montoya."" It was more about Estrella than Catherine. The book seemed to be written from Estrella's point of view but not written in the first person. I haven't read the other books in this series and I don't plan to. Bummer."
3,Not for students of History,"As with the other books in this series the author is definitely not writing for students of history, nor is she concerned with the facts as related to the wives of Henry VIII, or indeed of the man himself. This book, like the ""Boleyn"" series written by Phillipa Gregory is strictly for entertainment purposes. No one who reads this book (or any of the others) should believe they are being given historical facts relating to any of the characters whether real or imagined. This is a ""fun"" book written simply and told in a style that is easy to understand and relate to in our time. For those whose interest in this subject has been piqued I would reccommend reading David Starkey's ""SIX WIVES"", the Queens of Henry VIII."
5,Detailed Instructions,"This cookbook is amazing. The recipes and menu suggestions are categorized by seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. There are three additional chapters, Big Bashes, Breakfast for Health Conscious Friends and Breakfast Basics. The Shopping Guide and the Game Plan are helpful organizing tools not included in most cookbooks. The Game plan is my favorite. It gives instructions on prepping and preparing the meal up to two weeks in advance. An invaluable tool for those with time constraints. Here are some of the recipes included in the book. Strawberry-Orange Juice, Parmesan Toast, Cinnamon Pineapple, Fresh Pear and Vanilla Muffins, Double Corn and Chili Pancakes, Jim Dodge's Nutmeg Pear Pie, Swedish Potato Sausage, and Walnut Cinnamon-Chocolate Coffee Cake are some of the more exotic additions, but there are plenty of the basic fare to satisfy a fussy eater."
5,This is a Breakfast/Brunch Keeper,Every recipe looks wonderful. The menus are appealing and there is great variety - something for every occasion and every taste.
1,Job killer,They expect us to buy their Chinese junk but they don't want us to work to be able to pay for it. They expect other employers to supply the buyers.
4,As stated,Curt makes an Excellent product it worked like a charm. great price as well as a great shIpment speed def reccomendation this.
4,"For what it is, the cd is phenominal","If you want rock-em sock-em in-their-prime tight pants Robert Plant with his shirt off junping around screaming ""squeeze my lemon till the juice runs down my leg"" zeppelin, than this isn't what your looking for. If your looking for Zeppelin in a completely diffrent perspective, something that you only hear once in a lifetime experiance, than this IS what your looking for. Beautifully orchistrated versions of your favorites with an added touch to the Whole Lotta Love make this cd soar."
2,It isn't very good!,"The musicians play the songs beautifully, but it doesn't sound good without percussions. Some people may like it that way. I'm not saying you do or don't, but I don't. I think that Kashmir-Symphonic Led Zepplin played by the 1997 London Orchestra is much better."
1,An Insult to Led Zeppelin,"I first thought that, wow, the symphonies are redoing Led Zeppelin songs, so I listened to it. This is purely an insult to Led Zeppelin, taking songs and putting them into what I like to call hell. SO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. YOU ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY!"
2,Not for the non-expert,"The book assumes that the reader has an exceptionally strong background in mathematics. One would expect that no matter how ""obvious"" the proofs to the theorems in the book may be (as the author claims), the author would at least present them. Slight inconsistencies and unclear definitions are scattered throughout the book. I highly recommend that you search for a different book."
2,terrible print,"I don't understand releasing a bad print of this film, and a bad soundtrack, when other elements must have been available. The laser disc of this film is far superior to this DVD release, which was a disappointment. When a decent print isn't available, and people really want the movie regardless, I can understand. But this can't be the best there is to offer."
4,It's got Jimmy Durante!,"I haven't seen the DVD of this movie yet, but it's got Jimmy Durante singing Ink-A-Dink-A-Doo! I'll be purchasing this movie, but not until I see some good reviews of the transfer quality."
4,Harry James,"I bought this album because of the Harry James orchestra as well as Xavier Cugat - long gone from the musical scene but still very delightful. The story is just a simple, lighthearted love story, but Jimmy Durante's signature song is worth the price."
4,"Good for the money, but you get what you pay for","This set lasted me for two years. I loved it because I love my pepper coarse and uneven. Eventually, the arm on the peppermill broke and now I'm heartbroken. I'm willing to pay more, but there are too many expensive peppermills that don't deliver. For the money, this set can't be beat."
3,pepper mill,attractive product handy size poor quality on the pepper mill crank handle broke after about 2 weeks.
2,not good pepper mill,"I have this set for 2 years. The saltshaker has no problem, but 2 parts of the pepper mill, the part of the handle and the top screw, were broken under normal use after a few months. In addition, this pepper mill doesn't work well if you fill it with peppercorns. When peppercorns are full, it produces very little and very fine pepper grinds; however, it starts to make very big & rough pepper grinds when the amount of peppercorns is getting low. Even though these look very pretty, it was a very bad choice."
1,Still Waters Run Deep,"Sorry, This book (STILL WATERS RUN DEEP) and the one before it RIVERS OF THE SOUL are two of the most meandering and boring books I have ever read ! If I had read STILL WATERS RUN DEEP first (to darn bad I didn't) , that would have been the end of it for me. These people were quite simply, unbelievable as were the messes they were constantly in. Jerome and Toni came across as extremely dumb. To many tears, to much drama. The ""conversations"" between the characters in this story were so rambling it made me go to sleep...and sleep and...you know. The author's dedication at the beginning of the book was extremely beautiful. I know Ms. Esdaile has passed on. May she rest in peace. However I cannot see myself reading any more of her books."
1,Not a practical case!,"I wouldnt buy this case unless you only want a protective case to prevent scratching etc.Cons:The flap does not seal the case, therefore it is not dust-proof.No storage available for charger, cables ... not even an extra CF card.Not water resistantIt does not even provide space to store the attachments that come with the camera .. something that is a basic neccessity atleast for what I bought ie. a Dimage A200.Pros:A light weight case to protect the camera from minor scratches.Good for quick access and when you only need to carry the camera.I returned mine ..."
4,A valuable primer for young people.,"I received this book when I was an adolescent. It gives an impressive view of the individuals who played a significant role in the Civil War (or the War Between the States if you prefer.) It contains 50 profiles, 25 from the Union and 25 from the Confederacy. Each profile is brief but cogent. Highly recommended."
5,Excellent product,I bought this as a gift for my wife to replace the ordinary camera case that came with the camera. We're impressed by the quality and aesthetics of the product. Thanks!
4,hard to find,not like the previous one I had that was like a regular wallet but it works for the price. And it arrived sooner than expected...OH! customer service if off the hook there was a small problem but they got on it the day I notified them....unbeliveable action for customer service these days.
2,Fairly Small Camera Bag,"My two cents on this product is that it's too small for even a small camera. I bought it for my Casio Exilim EXS880 and it barely fits. And if it barely fits, forget putting anything else in there: extra battery, extra memory card, etc. There is literally no extra room to play with. The ""weather proof"" covering it comes with is a joke. It barely fits over the bag, with or without a camera in it, and it's certainly NOT going to protect what's inside with any success. All it is is a piece of material that is connected to the bag, comes out of a hidden area, and ""stretches"" over the bag, barely.If your camera is anywhere close to the size of mine, which is pretty small, I would recommend going with a bag that's a little bigger."
4,An Excellent Computer Bag,"This is a versatile and capacious computer bag. About my only knock is that the Velcro closure system for the foldover side panel needs, well, more Velcro, something I've added on my own. The bag holds a laptop, all the electronic accoutrements of business travel, plus papers, magazines, etc. I had one stolen, and replaced it with the exact same bag."
3,Not their best,"Surprisingly my daughter didn't go ga-ga over this. She loves all things Wiggles and Santa, but this could not hold her attention. It is a lot like Wiggly Wiggly World, a lot of effects. They also use the same format of introducing the songs and their special guests/ singers. It was a bit too flashy for me. I recommend Wiggly Wiggly Christmas over this DVD."
2,Beware!,"Your toddler may just love this but I find it excreciatingly painful to watch over and over and over again. Skip this and go for another Wiggles video. Very low budget and tacky. ""Wags Stop Your Barking"" is catchy but I can do without the rest. Instead, may I recommend Yummy Yummy or Wiggles Magical Adventure."
3,Wiggles Review,I bought this for my 2 year old daughter. She lost interest after awhile. I think it was a lot of songs and not enough talking skits to make it interesting enough for a 2 year old. She didn't recognize all the music and I think wanted to see more talking.
5,That's More Like It !!,"After reading ""The Trojan Sea"" I was concerned that one of my favorite authors had lost his touch. Having just finished ""The Last Phoenix"" it's apparent that the author has returned to what his fans like about his books. The action...the politics...the characters...are all first rate. Mr. Herman, please continue in this direction. I can see the next generation of Pontowskis and Turners coming... Don't make us wait so long for the next one!"
2,Herman needs to stop trying so hard to know it all,"Herman should stick to what he knows, military fiction, and leave the politics out. There is too much going on in this story, a major world crisis, the first female president, etc. Each deserves a novel unto itself. Herman over stretches his knowledge on this one."
5,Women have always liked this scent.,"All women I have dated, including my wife, love the smell of this cologne. I highly recommended it."
2,Intellectualized nonsense,"I was game for a fresh look at The Beatles. I've read more than 40 books on the greatest act in the history of entertainment, and thought this might be something unique. Well, it is. But that doesn't make it good. Note that the author wasn't alive during his subject's existence. Perhaps that's why he overextends himself with a lot of overanalysis. McCartney describes The Beatles as ""a great little band."" That's way too simplistic, of course, but it's closer to the truth than what this guy tries to pass off. He lost me when he included his note-to-self from long ago that the collarless jackets were a castration symbol. Oh, geez."
5,Funny Heartwarming Book,"One of her early books, very well written, full of love and fun. You will laugh time and time again with the antics of the main characters. This is a definite feel good book. Reminds us life can be fun and romantic."
1,Tepper represents mediocracy at its best,"Lou Tepper has demonstrated in the past 4-5 years that his coaching abilities may either be far outdated or just bad. Guiding his defense the past two years to the worst overall rating in the school's history shows his inability to coach quality players successfully. Tepper needs to ""reinvent"" his coaching techniques to adjust to the student-athlete of the 21st century."
1,Defensive genius? What a joke!,"This guy produced the WORST defense in the history of LSU football! In case any of the suck-ups who wrote those glowing reviews haven't noticed, LSU now has one of the best defenses in college football, thanks primarily to someone who is a REAL DEFENSIVE GENIUS, namely Nick Saban. In a relatively short time, Saban has managed to expunge the blot on the LSU program left by Professor Tepper. If anyone out there wants to really learn about defensive play, you might want to see whether Saban is considering writing a book anytime soon. But whatever you do, don't waste your time with ""Dr. Tepper""."
1,burn it!!,Lou Tepper knows very little of linebacking.You want to learn linebacking???Try something else this guy is lost.
1,Bullcrap,I had this book on the sidelines with me in 2006. During the Indiana game I did not know what to do so I referred to an old Illini legend for guidance. What did he say? Go for 2....twice and lose the game by 2.Then there was his chapter on the most important and exciting part of the game. The punt. The rugby punt I employed because we had a bum punter really back fired.Thanks for nothing Coach Tepper!
4,Lovely Stuff,"this is a top class book on linebacking, it gives detailed information on common defensive scenarios from a linebackers perspective. One of the best things about the book is the great photo illustrations which make a description on paper much clearer in your head.It gives all the common linebacking techniques like sheding blockers, tackling etc, helps newcomers read QB/offensive formations making them better read-&-reactors!plenty of coaches drills given too. top quality book. highly recommened, especially for all non-native football players"
4,A broad range of appeal,"""The Doctor Will Not See You Now"" is an interesting autobiography of the first blind physician in Canada. Dr Jane Poulson suffered from ill health but kept up her zeal for life through great friendships, a rewarding career and deep faith. The author uses amusing anecdotes from her medical career, and provides insights into how faith can be maintained in the face of obstacles."
2,Just smooth jazz female vocals,"I bought several of her CD's and she is good to listen to but I keep waiting for her to break out into a Blues or Jazz tempo.Never happen,She is great back ground music.This fine lady also has a wonderful very smooth and soothing voice....So roll back the sheets, pop her on and turns the lights low,She is sure good at helping setting the mood up for a great time......Someone needs to add sexy in here , Guess I will do it,That she is!!!!! Once you hear her I think you will agree with that.Well I hope it works for you. lol did for me."
2,disappointment,i am sad to say that i was very disappointed from the condition of the dictionary cover. it looks used or damaged. this was the first time i have ordered somthing from amazon and i think it might be the last.
5,Simply the best general use dictionary,"This dictionary is without a doubt of the same standard as the Oxford English Dictionary.I have used this dictionary almost daily for about 3 years and have always found the word I am looking for, be it through pinyin or radical.The print is easy to read and supplies both the simplified and traditional character. This is then followed by a clear, precise, and succinct definition. The dictionary includes most of the set phrases as well. I cannot say enough good things about this dictionary."
5,Most Excellent,"I will not repeat too much what previous reviewers have said. This is indeed the best Chinese English dictionary around, my copy is so worn out I need to get a new one. I will just point out what I think is missing, at least from my edition (the 2000 one I think)- Somebody already mentioned- a table of grammatical functions, not too critical really- The measure word for nouns would be most useful- A section of difficult characters, some characters are hard to look up as their root is not clear, some dictionaries have a special section for these, and this is missing.And last but not least, not really a problem on its own, just my personal preference, I like the traditional characters much much more than the simplified ones, and would have liked them to be used as the 'default', but since this is printed in China, it's probably too much to ask for."
5,I am happy with my purchase,"It is a new item the one I bought. It is a cd, and I am very happy. Tango Tienda sent me this from Argentina. It Came quickly and in a very good package.I am going to continue buying cds from them."
5,Praise for a wonderful lady,"This 2CD set takes the listener through the career of Rosemary Clooney, including the ""hokey"" 50's as well as the mellow jazz renditions with Nelson Riddle and Duke Ellington. This album looks like it will get worn out on my CD player. I will be playing it for decades. Noone sings with more musical eloquence than Rosy."
5,the greatest female voice of the 20th century,"the creamiest, dreamiest richest voice singing truly magical and remeniscient songs."
5,Wow! What a voice!,"This is one of the best CD's I've heard. Although I absolutely adore CD #1 which has her really early stuff - CD #2 is great too, the arrangements a bit more jazzy and her voice a bit more smokey. I wish there were more of her early recordings available on CD - I'd buy them all. She's a real star - not just George's aunt!"
2,Not worth it,"The pepper mill and salt shaker set impressed me at first. I liked the color of the wood and the shape of the set. However, the pepper mill doesn't grind consistently and I'm usually left with peppercorns that are only ""cut"" in half. And now, the bottom to the salt shaker falls out, spilling salt everywhere. I regret purchasing this set and plan on buying a new one as soon as possible."
5,Pepper Mill & Salt Shaker Set,"This salt & pepper shaker set is remarkabley beautiful. They have a nice, shiney finish and contour your table accents. They work perfectly and I highly recommend them!"
4,Mesmerizing film...,"""House"" (1977) is a Japanese horror comedy film by Nobuhiko Obayashi. The film is about six school girls who visit the aunt of one of the girls in the country. They come face to face with supernatural events, and one by one are eaten by the house. The film is a wild ride of images using a multitude of film techniques and sets which are sometimes playfully cheesy, and sometimes mesmerizingly brilliant.The blu-ray has several special features, including interviews with the director, a critique of the film by Ti West, and another full length movie by Obayashi called ""Emotion""(1966). There is also a booklet with critical essay by Chuck Stephens."
2,Vastly overrated,Reviews have been raving about this low-budget mess from Japan but it would seem to me (having finally suffered it) that it's pleasures barely make up a few minutes.
2,"Visually amazing, but that's about it.","I saw the trailer to this movie and I had to have it. Being a fan of Japanese horror films, I thought this would be an excellent film to add to my collection. Unfortunately it was just an ok movie with cool visuals, it's not worth the price and I would say their are better Japanese horror films out there. If you can get this movie for dirt cheap or even better for free then check it out just for the crazy psychedelic visuals."
1,Crap,I won't bore you with a long narrative. This movie was awful. Very big disappointment. I will even sell my copy!
1,House-broken,"I wanted to see something off-the-wall and different and I had missed this film when it played at the DFT (Detroit Film Theater).So, I took a chance on a Criterion sale at the local bookstore and really regret spending the money. I labored through this filmtrying to find some redeeming value or cinematic technique that might have earned it a Criterion release. I even watched theterrible short film that was a DVD extra as well as the ""House Appraisal"" feature that was delivered by a no-name film enthusiast.His insight into the ""innovative artistry"" of HOUSE was less informative than a TV Guide log line - inept, shallow, and inarticulate.The cover picture on the DVD should scare you off; I wish it had warned me."
2,Visually stunning but that's about it,"This film recieved so much hype before its release that I thought it was worth buying before I had ever seen it. I regret that choice greatly. Let's face it, Criterion releases aren't cheap folks...you really need to see this before you buy as I've heard of a number of people who are in the same boat as me. This film is not for everyone...it's visually stunning to be sure, but in the end it's a nonsensical,headache inducing, boring mess of a film. Buyer beware...rent this before you drop a load of cash on a movie there's a good chance you prob won't like."
1,water the lawn with your easy set pool,"What a disaster - the pool had multiple leaks and the ring kept deflating - sending hundreds of gallons of water onto my lawn. After weeks of trying to patch and get the pool up and running - I gave up. Customer service personnel are among the rudest I have ever spoken to - one hung up on me and the supervisor actually raised his voice to me and told me that they actually don't warranty the liner, only the pump, that I should read all the paperwork (even though they sent me the paperwork to return the liner). It's August and I still don't have my replacement pool - great summer fun ! I have a dead patch of grass - a ladder and a pump."
5,so far so good,"I really stalled when considering this purchase beacuse of the negative reviews esp with setup. Finally I just did it and I could not be happier. Maybe I'm lucky because my yard is relatively flat, but my sister and I set it up in 15 min. Of course it took about 10 hours to fill it up using 1 hose (I'm not sure what other reviewers thought would happen - unless you are going to fly in 3,000 gallons of water from the nearest lake, it is going to take so time). Today after setup and filling yesterday it is warm and ready to go. It seems like it is going to be just as enjoyable without the extreme upkeep of my old 20,000 gal inground pool. Can't wait to use it. Very easy to install."
1,Salt Water System is CRAP,The pool itself isn't bad but the salt water system is terrible. We are on our third system in two years and they do not back their product. Spend a little more money and get a different pool!!!
4,Good summer fun at a reasonable price,"Bought this pool back in beginning of August. Took a day to level off a spot in the yard (about 17 foot around). Aside from that it's pretty self explanatory, about 4hrs. to set up. Came with plenty of instructions, called a local pool supply and they helped me with the chemicals. Had to tie and steak the ladder down outside the pool, the baffle attachment is useless. The skimmer functions, but won't hold still with people in the pool. So if your using it, you need to shut the filter off when the pool is in use or the pump ends up cavitating,(sucks in air and stops pumping water)this will damage the pump! Overall we've, mostly my two boys, had a great time with it."
5,"Takes a full day to set up and fill, But its worth the money!","The shipping was fast and when we got the pool it took a long while to make it even and get all of the bumps out of the bottom before filling it with water. The filling process WILL take all day long it took from 10am until about 8pm and we had two water hoses running . This pool IS worth the money and time though. Just MAKE SURE YOUR GROUND IS EVEN, or the pool will be lopsided."
3,"Good, Summer Fun",This pool is lots of fun for all ages. All you have to do is make sure that the ground is level!
4,It is worth the price!,The pool came completely new and sealed and it did not have any leaks whatsoever. The only complaint that I have is that the installation takes a long time. For those that will be buying this pool just make sure that the ground is completely level cuz if it is not than it will be a real mess. Also it takes over 8 hours to fill the whole pool so make sure you have time.
2,Book,This book is a classic and contains good information. The printing however is horrible as the description states. Most all of the periods were missing from this print which I found highly annoying. I would not have bought if I had know how bad the reprint was.
3,Have no fear...,"Have no fear, Dexter Danger is here to free you from the evil forces of the mundane, repetitive, and whiny pop-punk music that has been taking over the airwaves. Sadly, in a world full of evil, Dexter fails to clearly identify themselves as the good guys."
3,Its good mixing but not what I expected,"As the subject tells, it is good mixes and high energy, but not what I was looking for, i.e. its not hardcore music."
1,BIG FAT ZERO,"The good news: The 960 model is out.The bad news: It solves none of the problems of the 950.Unlike the previous reviewer, my Airstrike has none of the instructions his has. Mine ONLY says:1. ""Place pump head on valve stem and lock level in down position""2. ""Hold pump at 90 (degrees) while inflating""Anyway, this is marketed solely as a bike pump and mentions nothing about beach balls or whatever.Mine worked up until about 30 PSI...which I don't think will even fill a child's bike tube, much less what's on the product's photo: an adult's 90 PSI mountain bike tube.Stick to Bell helmets and nothing else. I even bought some Bell tubes and one of them has a faulty/leaky valve that I can even tighten/loosen with the cap tool.All this is enough to make a beginner want to just quit biking before they've even started. Way to shoot yourself in the foot, Bell."
1,Don't even think about buying it,"I just spent a good 40 minutes on trying this pump and only got on the net to post a review of this crap. It's a tire DEFLATOR, not a pump. It's a really poor product in every aspect. I'm not sure how a few others got it working, but I was not able to. I just need to pump some air into the tires, that's all, so simple. Arrggghhh."
1,Worst pump ever,"This pump simply is designed improperly. The opening where the pump attaches to the tire valve is simply too small. It does not fit, and this makes it impossible to inflate a tire. I can't believe that this thing is actually sold anywhere by anyone."
2,Mediocre,"This bike pump will be great to pump up your kids soccer balls or basketballs because it is small, compact, and stows away nicely in the car's trunk. But trying to properly inflate your bike tires, not so much. You will be working quite a bit to adequately inflate the tires. It will do in a pinch when no other means are available but I suggest just spending your $10 and investing in a good bike pump to begin with."
1,Returned....Seriously Bell?,This is one pathetic attempt and creating an air pump. The bracket supplied with it is also a plastic poorly made device I would not place on my quality bike. Thank you for wasting my time and I plan on returning this product.
2,bell pump,"I own several bike products made by Bell and they all work. The problemwith these mini-pumps is that they should be labeled ""for emergency.""If you get a leaking tires and happened to be miles from home, then 15 to 20 PSI is better than zero PSI. But if your tires already have 50 to 65 PSI, this product will not help and you can only lose some air pressure.A regular bike pump is still needed. These mini pumps (Schwinn makes them, also) are more for looks and a temporary help. I used to have a huffy pump that attached to my bike and it could do alot more than this one, but it was approx. a 16"" air chamber."
3,"It does work, but I would make some comments","I agree with the reviewer that gave 5 stars: the pump DOES work, but I'm still not a big fan. Basically, you want to follow the instructions the reviewer gives you, but you have to create the seal by turning the screw cap REALLY tight. If you think it's tight enough, try further. Then pull the lever back down, if everything is working ok it will offer some noticeable resistance. Apply the pump to the tire and start pumping. My experience is that the pump still leaks air, but I've managed to inflate the tires of my stroller by continuously adjusting the angle while pumping. Therefore I think it's not a great pump, although I have to admit that it works, to some extent. The pumps that really work are the ones they sell in my home country in Europe. Those have a flexible outlet that actually SCREWS onto the tire valve, making a perfect seal. I hope I had brought one of those back with me on my last trip."
2,buyer beware,"I purchased this pump because Bell has been making bicycle equipment for years, and yes, it was inexpensive. It was a Walmart purchase, and as they say, you get what you pay for. I have had several flats lately... and luckily on one of my longer rides the pump did work. However, it never was able to achieve high pressure but I could pump enough air to get me back home. Now, it has failed completely. And yes, I do understand how to properly create a seal with the valve. Something internal seems to have failed. It did give indications of problems earlier, and the pump arm/piston would pop out randomly as I was pumping. Now there seems to be air coming out of the hing area of the lever, and no pressure is achieved.I'll spend a little more for a more reliable pump. Suggestions?"
5,pump works great,"Bought this at walmart for 10 bucks and only came here to compare the price but was surprised by all the negative reviews. I really don't get why so many people seem to be having problems...I was able to pump my comfort bike from 0 to 45 psi no problems. I could have probably gone higher if necessary. Don't get me wrong, it does require good bit of elbow grease but in the end gets the job done and thats what counts.Make sure you adjust the adapter for correct valve type as per instructions. Mount onto the valve with lever in unlocked position then tighten the screw as tight as possible then lock and pump away. Nice feature is the dual action which not many people have mentioned meaning it pumps air on pull as well as push.Also design of the mounting hardware allows it to mount together with a water bottle holder. All in all a nice pump for a good price. Just not getting the negative reviews though."
1,Absolute piece of garbage,"Could never get this pump to properly seal..Yes, I followed directions. Piece of junk. ""Upgraded"" to the next level of Bell pump, and it would not create any pressure in the chamber...another waste of money. Got smart and saved the receipt on that one so I can get a refund. I'll never buy a Bell product again. Their design is so simplistic, pretty hard to screw up...but they did, on both models I tried."
1,Worthless!,This almost left me stranded. I tried pumping up a half-full tire and it completely deflated it instead. It has no clamp or seal whatsoever! Do not buy this unless you want to throw your money away!
1,The Worst,"What the heck is this? It doesn't form a seal AT ALL. The ""lever"" does NOTHING. I SHOULD lock the pump on the valve stem. NOPE!All it does is deflate the tire.DO NOT BUY THIS!It gets NO STARS from me even though Amazon made me give it 1."
1,buyer beware!,"Just a heads up that if your mounting bracket breaks, Bell does not have replacement brackets! If your bracket breaks you have to buy a whole new pump. My suggestion is a Topeak pump instead, they have replacement parts no matter how small."
1,This is lousy,I agree with most everyone else-even following the directions I lost more air than added. Then the handle came off. You'll be better off with another brand.
1,"Not a pump, but rather a tire deflator","This pump doesn't seal around the valve so all the air comes out of the bike tire/football/or whatever you are trying to pump and no air can go in.This product should be sent to the Island of Misfit Toys, as it is a pump that DEFLATES your items."
1,Do NOT buy this pump,"I got this at Walmart (only 10 bucks) and when I got home to pump my tires up, IT DIDNT WORK. It does not form a seal over the valve. I thought maybe it was a defective one so I went back to Walmart and returned it for a new one. Well that didn't work either! This pump does not form a seal on the valve, so instead of putting air in, it deflates my tires!! All the comments you read from other people are 100% true. Don't waste your money on this. Spend the extra 4 dollars and get something that works!"
1,Simply not worth it.,"It shouldnt be this hard. Simply not worth doing it. Be it top up situation or emergency, I dont think you will be interested to read all the instructions and do step by step etc. Its not for an aircraft! I was expecting this to be simple and handy which it isnt. Cannot return this and gave it away to a professional sports club."
2,"It works, but you can buy better","I bought this pump at Target. I decided to test it before hitting the road. I deflated a 700x23 road tire completely, then proceeded to pump it up with this pump. The issue I had was it seemed to take a while to pump up and the pull-out stroke (the 2nd half of the dual action) felt awkward and not very useful. I felt like I was struggling with it more than it added to putting air volume in the tire. Used correctly, this pump does work. I was able to get my tire up to about 80 PSI before I deemed the pump ""good enough"" to get me back on the road should I flat. However, I am returning this pump to Target as I was able to find an equally priced but better working pump from Performance Bike (the Performance Hurricane Micro Mini Pump)."
4,Great!,"Talking about the screen resolution, you will not be disappointed by this product. It is good for the price, I am recommending it. I bought it after I dumped an earlier pyramid screen i bought. The only problem you have to contend with, which is negligible anyway, is in opening it. the screen is stiff and doesnt easily flip down, you have to drag it down. Apart from this, it is a great item!"
4,good picture,this had a great picture and worked really well. The only issue we ever had was the button to drop the screen down was very tight. I fixed this by grinding down the latch a little bit with a file.
4,It's hard to open,"The button to open the screen sticks in the frame, and don't let the monitor get down easily, I have to make some effort to set it. But the image is great and the lights are really nice"
2,specification item no audio,Product look good for the picture. I recevied quickly in 3 days. When I order my product. the specification say audio/video input. when I open and test. I can only use one rca cable for video.. I can't not get sound out. but the screen and control have volume up and down... Need to description detain... wrong information about audio/video input.
1,defective piece,"i received a defective piece, which is not working.......I bought for Saudi Arabia. When it came here i found its not working. These amzon guyz are not helping me to replace the defective piece.I want them to pay all the charges for courier service."
3,"IF YOU LOVE FOOD AND WORDS, THIS BOOK'S A WINNER","3/24/2005Cupboard Love:A Dictionary of Culinary CuriositiesBy Mark MortonThis is the second, revised edition of Cupboard Love and a must-own for etymologists, food etymologists in particular. In 330 pages, Morton defines origins of words such as the bain-marie, what is banyan day? How about the word, cornucopia, the corsned, hyppogastronomy or sesame.For instance, the word, tiramisu"" is: ""The name of this dessert comes from the Italian phrase, tira mi su, literally meaning pick me up, probably because the coffee-soaked sponge cake provides a slight caffeine boost. ""Tiramisu"" began to appear in England in the early 1980s. Much earlier, in the mid nineteenth century, pick-me-up, itself emerged as a name for a stemulationg drink, one intended to perk up the imbiber.Cupboard Love is full of these morsels, makes a lovely gift.Marty Martindale, 2005, Largo FL"
5,Used?,"This is another ""used"" book that I bought. It came brand new! I recommend searching for ""used"" books before buying a new one."
5,What a great book!,"This book is perfect for anyone who likes two things: food and words. That's because it combines the two: it tells you where food words came from. And it's exhaustive -- I haven't been able to think of a food word yet that's not in the book. What I really love, in addition to all the good information about where food words came from, is the author's irreverent sense of humour. He's hilarious, but his humour never gets in the way of the information -- it just makes you want to read more. Get this book, and keep it in your kitchen -- you'll find yourself reading entries from it as you're waiting for water to boil, pudding to cool, and so on. (And by the way, did you know that ""pudding"" originally referred to sausages?!)"
2,"Not one of the best,but maybe worst","I didn't like either versions of ""I Think I Love You"" Found at the beginning and end of this CD. The remakes of Partridge Family songs weren't so hot either. I did like a few songs, but the CD ""Didn't You Use To Be..."" was much better. This CD will grow on you after while,if your a fan."
5,I think I love you to!,"This is a wonderful ""grown-up"" David Cassidy Album. I have loved David since I was a young girl and listening to this cd just makes me feel good inside. The new version of I think I love you is fantastic and he has alot of new songs that as the other reviewer said will get stuck in your head for days! I saw David in Vegas ""at the copa"" and it was GREAT!"
5,AWESOME!,"This CD is a must-have if you're a Da-idy fan! He sounds better than ever and it's been long overdue! My favorites are ""No Bridge I Wouldn't Cross"" and ""You Were the One"". The remakes of ""the classics"" were fantastic!My only regret is that I've never seen any videos for this CD (and I know there are some) Why do they make videos if they don't get shown? And why doesn't this very talented singer get any airplay? The only ""airplay"" he gets is the Muzak at the department store where I work."
1,"""New Dog,"" bad accident.","Someone's has got to say it, this album is a real bow-wow. Not one redeeming track. His worst release ever. Even surpasses that awful Mike Curb album he did in the '80's. Retooling a few of his past Partidge tunes was a good idea, but the new arrangements included here are painful. Stick with his greatest hits package and hope Arista and RCA will eventually release his solo albums on cd."
2,"Not one of the best,but maybe worst","I didn't like either versions of ""I Think I Love You"" found at the beginning and end of this CD. The remakes of Partridge Family songs weren't so hot either. I did like a few songs, but the CD ""Didn't You Use To Be..."" was much better. This CD will grow on you after while,if your a fan."
5,David Cassidy at his best!,Wonderful combination of old and new.....David Cassidy sounds better than ever....and I was lucky enough to get mine autographed by David himself!
3,Ex teen idol David Cassidy is back.,"Twenty five years after the partridge family and David Cassidy is still recording albums.Old trick new dog is great all the songs have a new beat to them especially i think i love you. the best song is no bridge i wouldn""t cross."
1,I Love David but stay away from the hip hop sound!,"After watching the old Partridge Family shows and listening to David Cassidy sing.....I was looking forward to this album, even though I had not heard it yet. I was very disappointed in it, I still love David's voice but the music he decided on was gaudy. And please leave the old songs alone!"
4,First of the Poe/Corman films,"This movie gets off to a slow start but manages to generate plenty of scares and suspense before it's over. I've heard this was a low budget production but there are great sets, lavish costumes, intelligent script and a another scenery chewing performance by Vincent Price. If the budget was low, it was well spent. The story concerns some of Poe's favorite themes including madness, premautre burials, and crumbling castles. Not as scary as Pit and the Pendulum or Masque of the Red Death but this film is still an important part of the Poe/Corman collaboration legacy."
4,The Fall of the House of Usher.,"I actually enjoyed this Corman/Price Flick compared to the other Corman/Price movies based on POE's work. It is not as Boring,the effects and everything seems to move along better than usual,and I think the sole reason why is probably Vincent Price sans Mustache and With Bleached Hair Yikes! Now that's creepy! Vincent Price God Rest his Soul could make even poop shine with his theatrical talent and voice,and he certainly pulls off the performance here."
5,Fall of the House of Usher,Vincent Price as Roderick the insane brother of the lead characters fiancee. I love the ending and I think this is a must for any fan of the classic master Vincent Price. You must watch this film before Hollywood attempts to ruin it with yet another terrible remake.
2,"A big let-down, literally.","Price is a wonderful actor, but some parts are wrong for him. Like this one. In many ways this is the least interesting of the Corman/Price movies. like the other Poe's they did together it looks good, but nothing much happens through-out. Somehow the ""horrific"" atmosphere isn't quite right. A cobweb here - the odd skeleton there; it just doesn't add up to a whole lot. -And that creepy crypt isn't enough, either. Also, similar ""resurrection"" scenes were done to much greater effect in Val Lewton's ""Isle Of The Dead"" (RKO, 1945.) In my view, the only ""scary"" sequence is the blue-ish nightmare scene. The rest of the film is a dull theatre play; even an appreciated letterbox version couldn't change that."
1,"It's by Roger Corman, so it ain't much.","This turkey of a film has everything Corman is famous for. Chessy effects, overacting, and no story what so ever. Scary for it's time, it ain't."
4,GREAT ATMOSPHERE ON A BUDGET!,"This film, which had the small budget(even for it's time)of $270,000, has more atmosphere than most films costing 100 times that amount. Roger Corman, known for his low budget horror films, directed eight films based on Poe stories(at least in name)in the 60's. The series was very successful and most of them are among his best films.Hiring Vincent Price was also a smart move because few can sell this stuff as well as he can and he wasn't demanding a large sum for the role. I was really surprised just how good this film looked with it's foggy grave settings and haunted manor. If you like Corman or Hammer horror films, then this creepy little film should be up your alley. It's a little slow in the first half, but picks up in the second for a rewarding finale. I caught this on MGMHD and it looked really nice in HD......maybe a Blu Ray edition is one the way?"
4,Classic Vincent Price,"If you're a Vincent Price fan, you need this movie. It's creepy Vincent at his best! Fall of the House of Usher is another great addition to the MGM Midnite Movie line."
4,Lavish Gothic horror`,"This was the first film that Roger Corman made, when he hit upon the idea of adapting the Edgar Allen Poe classics, and it's the best one. Apparently, it was a huge success when first released, and it still retains much of it's power. Vincent Price plays the tormented Roderick Usher, last in the line of a cursed family living in a crumbling mansion. An outsider comes with the intention of marrying his sister, and soon the horrible truth is revealed. Much of the film looks beautiful, colours are deep and lavish, and the set of the house is suitably creepy, with ghoulish portraits of all the hideous Usher ancestors lining the walls. The cast is small, and Price chews his way through his part as ever, with many flowery speeches and gestures, but the film still delivers, especially in the spectacular fiery climax. Obviously, they aren't making them like this any more, and it all looks a bit dated, but as an example of 60's costume horror, it looks great."
4,THE FALL OF ACTING COMPARED TO NOW!!!!,"The story and plot was great!!! It had great storyline and the actual story was marvelous. There were some bad parts to this movie even so. I think the acting was just ok, partly because it was made over 60 years ago. Some of the special effects and props looked so fake. The best part to this movie was the part when Madeline goes mad and comes out of her coffin. SHe has bloody hands and drips a trail of blood up to her brother's bedroom. I like all teh blood on the doorknob. The music also added to the suspense. All in all it was great!!"
1,Don't buy this one even 1 star is to much,"This dvd is only for people who never heard of Rock 'n' Roll. It's a shame that Michael Ochs (who once send me a personal copy of his wonderful Rock Archives) give so many words and smiles on this bad documantairy. (sorry Michael, when comes a new edition of your great book?) Don't buy this one but if you really want to... you can have mine."
2,r'n'r video,Did not realize how corny these old 50's rock'n'roll movies were....but now i do.quality was fine .....nobody's fault how bad the movie was....did i really go see that in the 50's??? no wonder I am messed up
4,Law and Justice 6th Gre,Great book for my CJ class at UHDowntown. My professor Dewey solely pulls all information for a quiz out of this detaled book.
1,My Disappointment,"I was so disappointed when I got my book because I thought I ordered the 6th edition and I used the 5th edition that I was sent but a lot was missing that I actually needed. Any way, I did not want to send it back because there was not enought time!"
1,Another Piece of trash from Pearl,"This book is ""no greater joy"" for a sick author... he describes every method he can think of to spank a child, how to neglect your infant and toddler through things such as leaving them unattended for hours and leaving them strapped to a car seat for hours after switching them with a whip multiple times. The authors' methods have resulted in parents being investigated by Child Protective Services, children being taken away from parents, a restraining order against a father, and even a babysitter going to jail on felony charges! Avoid this horrible book at all costs."
5,Wonderful!,"I loved this book. I read it as a followup on To Train Up A Child and thought this 3 part series of books most helpful. I have such happy, obedient children! Our home is such a blessing and full of laughter and happiness. People are ALWAYS commenting on how well-behaved our children are. Thanks to the Pearls for their biblical teaching. Sadly, what they teach now used to be a normal way of life for most people. It's easy to see the results from straying from these teachings. Look at how wicked, perverse, selfish, and sinful our society is. If everyone would just get back to the Bible in how they raise their children, our world would be a much better place. Thank you No Greater Joy ministries!"
1,Horrible examples of abuse,This is one of the most disgusting books ever written. The Pearls are sick individuals who should be rotting in jail for their part in promoting child abuse. If you read this book understand that it is not the way you want to raise your children.
1,Brutal child abuse,"This is brutal child abuse in God's name. These authors are manipulating God's Word with a devil's mind. This is Unchristian parenting, simply controlling, sick, and evil child abuse.Parents who abuse their own children with such techniques should be sent to jail immediately."
1,A Guide to Abusing Your Children,"Athough it's a miracle that these pepoele are literate enough to compile a book that is where the miracle ends.Their book has served as a guide to death for several children.http://www.newsobserver.com/102/story/418676.htmlPlease do not take their advice and use plumbing supplies to beat your children.If you read this book and take their ""advice"" there's a good likelihood that Children's Protective Services will come a knockin' at your door.I'm begging you to not beat your children or purchase this abomination."
1,Sick,"If you want to learn how to destroy your child, turn them into little robots who fear their parents go ahead and get this book. If I could give negative stars I would. How DARE these people market this book under the guise of godly parenting. It's nothing more than an instruction book on child abuse."
1,Child Abuse Manual,"Growing up in a loving, non-violent household, I am awestruck at the ideas suggested in this book. The overall principle is to switch or whip your child into immediate obedience. Nothing is said about taking the time to socialize children in a loving way, just getting immediate compliance. This is lazy at best and grounds for investigation at worst. The book even recommends switching babies younger than 12 months! The ideas in the book are said to be based in religion, but no doubt God is saddened that parents would treat children this way. PLEASE do not buy this book!"
1,Sadistic book written by hethens,A four-year-old little boy has already died because his mother followed the Pearls' advice on how to discipline him. Michael and Debi Pearl are in no way experts on parenting or discipline. They are child abusers and they should be stopped. It is a disgrace that this book has even been published. Amazon-PLEASE STOP SELLING THIS TRASH. One child is already dead - how many more have to die from this nonsense???
1,Fetishist disguised as parents!,"After reading these books I was in complete disgust that any loving parent thinks this is a guide to help you raise your children. This IS NOT the work of a true loving parent who wants to teach their children fundamentally sound lessons on life. This is however, the work of sadistic fetishist who get their jollies off stripping their children naked and beating them. I truly want to know how anyone can find any logic in hitting, smacking, and torturing a child into being a respectful, thoughtful person. I've tried and I still don't get it. But I think the better question regarding these animals is why haven't they been arrested? These people are seriously mentally disturbed and by reading some of the reviews, it looks like they're developing a small, cult like following. Kool-Aid anyone?"
1,You can't judge a book by its cover but....,"Seriously, what's up with that art on the cover? A scarecrow can represent Jesus? Disciplined siblings make better scarecrows together? Jesus looked like a scarecrow on the cross? My personal interpretation: follow this book and your children will be as docile as scarecrows (and have about the same brain power)...Or... whip your children with a length of plumbing tubing and they'll wind up with fulfilling careers as scarecrow makers."
1,Withdraw this book!!! DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK.,This book PROMOTES CHILD ABUSE and should be withdrawn immediately. The one star rating is simply to register this review.
1,No greater nightmare,"How can these Pearls continue writing these whipping books? The scenario about the 11-month-old having its hand whipped because it didn't want it's food is evil, not beautiful. Anybody who thinks that whipping any person's hand, let alone a baby's, should hang their heads in shame. I must feel for that poor baby crying afterwards."
1,"No stars - if you prescribe to this, get help - you're sick","I can't even give this a star rating it is so low. This is about child abuse. If this is where your heart is you need to find help fast! The old testament also condoned stoning, smithing, and other horrific acts to mankind. It is not to be taken literally. Please, if you find yourself ""stuck"" with a dilemma with your child, seek out professional help for yourself and the child. The authors of this book need to be put away. This book is violent!!!!!!!!"
5,Excellent answers to exasperating problems!,"Most of the really negative reviews of all the Pearl books are written by a group of folks who have a vendetta against them. They have a stated goal of destroying the Pearls ministry and credibility. DON'T BE SWAYED! Read these books for yourself! I have gleaned MANY good tidbits from the No Greater Joy books. If you are a Christian, you will doubtless find a lot of good instruction and advice in these books. If you are not, and are on a mission, then just go read Dr. Spock and raise your kids like you want to!Bottom line: Scriptural and informational!"
1,A manual for Child Abuse!! Amazon should not sell this book!,"This book deserves no stars. It deserves to be removed from print. As a parent practicing Attachment Parenting, I was horrified when I perused this book and read what these people are trying to teach parents. This book is nothing but a manual for child abuse! It glorifies using a switch to hit babies as young as 3 months. This book is a disgrace. I hope that parents looking for discipline help turn to such noted experts as Dr. and Martha Sears, and the ""Discipline Book"" as well as the numerous others that are truly helpful and will encourage parents to discipline--NOT hit--their beautiful and remarkable children."
1,More Pearls of Evil,"This book is a sequel to the Pearls' baby-whipping manual ""To Train Up a Child."" It is sickening to read of all the child abuse the Pearls' advocate to create ""Godly"" children. Children can be disciplined just fine without whipping them! How can any child love someone who whips them? How can any baby trust a parent who abuses them instead of comforting them when they cry? Instead of REAL love and trust, the Pearls force feigned expressions of love and trust, using fear and pain on tiny children, human beings who have nowhere to turn and nobody to protect them.Skip this book unless you want to mess up your children. And for the people who think this kind of ""training"" is Biblical, NOWHERE in the Bible does it say to whip an infant."
1,Wish I could give NO STARS !,"This book is a baby whiping manual and advocates the abuse of innocent little children. It should be taken off the market!In spite of the frustrations of raising a child, parents should take the high road and seek to be patient, loving and kind toward their children, teaching them in return to love and show kindness, respect and gentleness to others. Hitting children only teaches aggression and that hitting solves problems, which we all know that it doesn't.Please save your money and buy a different book, perhaps The Disciple Book by William & Martha Sears, Positive Discipline by Jane Nelsen, or How To Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk by Adele Faber & Elaine Mazlish (all available on Amazon.com). Don't give a cent of your hard earned money to the Pearls for their garbage baby beating books!"
5,Godly parenting,This is a great book that should be required reading for all parents. It is well written with a great sense of humor. If you want great and happy kids read and apply this book.
1,Harmful book could lead to child abuse,"In a country where almost a quarter of a million children are found to be physically abused each year, it is appalling that ""No Greater Joy"" has been published. It condones abusive actions by parents such as that recommended on p.85 by Michael Pearl. He recommends giving a little girl who won't get into her seat ""five licks with a stinging switch"". If the girl still doesn't get in the car seat, ""repeat the switching"". If the girl continues to refuse to get in the seat the parent should take the seat into the house and strap the girl in it for ""two or three hours"". It's surprising he doesn't talk about how to beat child abuse charges since that could be a likely outcome of such abusive behavior to children."
1,If only we could do this to the parents who like these books,"I'd say ""let's turn the tables and beat these parents"" except, we may have a hard time finding someone with the stomach to do these things to another human being. It scares me that people are appreciative of this book!"
1,Awful,"This book promotes child abuse and is less than useless for learning how to raise healthy, happy children."
1,Sick,Parents need to smack themselves around a little bit if they think this is the way to raise a decent human being.
1,Negative Stars for a Book that is Worthless,"The Authors of this Garbage advocate beating your young children to train them. They need to be arrested not published.I am disgusted to think that there is any parent out there that would follow the "" teachings"" of these lunatics..."
1,"Don't buy this vile ""book""","This is sadistic advise from untrained laypeople on how to humilliate, physically and psychologically damage children. Why does Amazon continue to see products by this sinister man?Boycott the publishers!"
1,Save your money,"People have listed all sorts of books that are much better than this one. I completely wasted my money on this. The author(s)' points are not biblical. Sure they use bible passages but they are completely taken out of context. I try to live my life on what Jesus would do. I""m not perfect but I try. You can guide children through life without hitting them. There is a way to gently parent without using humiliation and fear that this book advocates. I urge you to seek out dr. sears. He has some very good techniques on raising children."
1,Only Pedos and Abusers Would Take Joy in This,"This is another 'How To Abuse' manual by the Pearls, who have no expertise nor training. They are self-published lay people. Their opinions are not any more valid than yours.Save your money."
1,Very troubling---,"If you would like to know more about the discipline in this book, you should google the name Lynn Paddock and The Pearls.Her beautiful 4 year old son died from following The Pearls advice.Just awesomely bad advice I might add.I would strongly urge anyone who is having trouble with their children turn elsewhere...my feeling... there are plenty of books that can help you. In particular, many parents would be better served by reading ""The Out of Synch Child""... I bet you will see your child in that book and you can discipline your child while at the same time understand that there are some things going on with your kid that are way, way, way bigger than a rod can 'cure'.this is a very sad situation. And by the way, if you see the photo of Lynn Paddock's son your heart will break."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!! IT PROMOTES CHILD BEATING!!!,"This book, and its authors the Pearls, should be stopped from spreading hateful dangerous suggestions regarding the ""training"" of babies and children.The Pearls's advice boils down to: Hit/switch/beat your newborn - get them early before their willfullness sets in! Hit/switch/beat your toddler. Hit/switch/beat your children. Hit/switch/beat your children anytime they make or appear to be ready to make an expression of free-will or ""rebellion"" of any kind - these include crying (6 mos.), refusing to eat anymore baby food (11 mos.), wanting a Twinkie (6 yrs), not wanting to get in a car seat (3 yrs) -- this also comes with the recommendation of (after one, two, or three beatings) taking the child inside the house and strapping her into her carseat and ""leaving her there for two or three hours"" !THIS BOOK AND THESE PEOPLE PROMOTE AND PROFIT FROM THE ABUSE, BEATING, HUMILIATION, AND NEGLECT OF CHILDREN!!!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,Very Sadly Misguided people..,"The authors of this book are so sadly misguided, it is they that need help not the children they advocate abusing."
1,just HORRIBLE!!!,"This book is simply horrible and the advice concerning child raising given in it is barbaric. To give the book the attribute ""christian"" is cynical and completely absurd. I give just one out of many examples:When a 3 year old screams the Pearls recommend: ""without saying a word go straight to the switch. Spank her where she stands."" ""Never threaten, and never show mercy. One squeak of a scream gets a switching."" p.26 The Pearls apparently have never read the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says ""Blessed are the merciful!""Don't read or buy the book!"
1,Please please don't buy this book!,These people advocate the outright abuse of children. They instruct readers to whip babies as young as 6 months with leather belts. I implore anyone out there to please not buy or read this book. It is pure evil.
1,Horrible,"The child raising techniques presented in this book are the most horrible ideas I have ever seen in my entire life. It passes far beyond child abuse, and into torture."
1,Horrific,What type of parent would take the advice of these nutjobs? Certainly not people deserving of the love of a child. They should be ashamed. I ache for their children. :(
1,Advocates the use of pipes on babies,"The Pearls use scripture taken out of context to defend their use of physical punishment on infants as yound s 4 months old. The use of a rod on a baby, let alone any child, is not sound parenting, nor is it truly advocated by God. I wonder, in following the Old Testament, if the author advocates stoning someone for gathering sticks on the Sabbath, or declaring your children unclean if they eat pork? The use of the Bible to defend physical punishment on a child is deplorable, and any Christian should remember that Christ put an end to much that was practiced under the law of Moses. Consider instead books by Dr Sears, Dr Greene, or Adele Faber and Elaine Mazlish."
5,Excellent resource,This is a great book and so helpful in raising joyful and obedient children. All of the No Greater Joy stuff that we have read and applied has helped our family. Actually read it for yourself before you read reviews that are taken out of context and written by people that have never even read the material themselves. Excellent resources
4,Read the book; form your own opinion,"Some of the reviews for this book are not based upon the book itself, but someone else's opinion and their choice of excerpts. I recommend reading this book and forming your own, informed opinion of it. I have found valuable information in it, and that which is not helpful I have the freedom to set aside. But I can only pick and choose from the author's wisdom (or lack thereof) when I actually read his writing. I would recommend this book by Michael and Debi Pearl. In looking up some of the ""quotes"" used in the reviews of other people about this book, I was distraught by how skewed a picture they portray by omitting the full story within its context, but I was also inspired by some of the stories of other families that are contained in the book. So inspired, in fact, that I plan to re-read it!"
1,Garbage for the ignorant,I did take the time to read this. It espouses a brutal and ignorant world-view. I am amazed that people follow these kooks and saddened for their children.
1,There's nothing Christ-like about child abuse,"This book sickened me. It is a manual for child abuse, pure and simple. It has already led to 2 children's deaths. Do there have to be more?"
1,Very dangerous,"This book is very dangerous. The things advocated are not only illegal (spanking, switching an infant!) they are very abusive. These people are an insult to the Christian religion. Their attitudes towards children AND women are disgusting and scary. Their whole agenda gives me the creeps!"
2,Irish brogues too thick to understand,"This may have been a decent movie. Unfortunately, I couldn't understand about 70 percent of the dialogue because the Irish accents are so thick. If they made this for American audiences, they might have at least considered toning down the brogues, which are authentic, but very hard for American ears to decipher. Also, I still don't know the differences between the warring factions here."
5,This film deserves more recognition,"I loved this movie. Jim Sturgis is becoming a fine actor. Ben Kingsley is always great (He looked weird with hair). The title of the Movie was very fitting, watch it and you'll see why. This story being based on real events makes it even better. Highly recommended. Oh yeah it's about an Irish dude working undercover for the MI-5."
4,Great Tea not so great price after shipping,"I was very pleased with the tea it has a great taste and goes well with a drop or two of milk. However, Tetley tea is on par with PG Tips and you can find that at your local grocery store for a much lower price since you won't need to pay for shipping. If price doesn't matter then PG Tips is the way to go!"
4,Received item as expected,"Received item as expected. Disc brand new and play fine. The only downside is it is only 3 disc. They should've put all first season disc in one box instead of 2 separate volume, what a rip off from the manufacture or studio."
5,Real tooth paste without sugar!,"My children (3 and 5 years) don't like tooth paste with flavours and sweeteners, and I was not able to find ""normal"" tooth paste for kids. Fortunately Amazon imports this from Europe.This white tooth paste is for kids, with no sugar or flavours, just what is really needed. And with no sugar kids don't want to swallow it."
5,One of the Best,Smoke Rings in the Dark is one of the best albums I own. I love every song on it. I saw Gary Allan in concert when he was touring this album... he sings like his album. A very talented artist.
5,I love Gary Allan!,"I love Gary Allan and he is cool and I think he is a big star becuase the albums he made was It would be you, used heart for sale, his third one smoke rings in the dark and his fourth one alright guy and he must be a big star!In his album smoke rings in the dark the songs I like is Right Where I need to be, Loving you against my will, Sorry & Cowboy Blues.Gary Allan wears a cowboy hat and plays an electric guitar and I saw him on CMT.I think he is a big star."
5,Incredible Voice + Incredible Music = Incredible CD!!!,"Gary, I tip my hat..... If you haven't purchased this CD you're missing out. This throaty-voiced Californian belongs right in the middle of Texas or Nashville. This CD ranks among the top with hits Smoke Rings and Right Where I Need to Be. In fact, this CD has great depth. You won't be disappointed. Cryin' for Nothin'....who hasn't been there!?! George, Tim, Kenny, Brad, Toby....better not look back."
5,This cd gives you tons and more,"On Gary's third attempt, he hits a home run. His song Smoke Rings In The Dark is a flavoral mixture about love gone wrong. He can give the best performances I have ever heard and he is the first of this music I have ever heard. Buy Buy Buy!"
3,Haunting title tune,"Like Keith reviewed before me, when I heard this song, I thought Chris Isaak had 'gone country' since this area's country station wouldn't play him otherwise. (Would like to hear his version,too.) Gary Allen does a great job with the title song; unfortunately, a coworker summed up the rest of the album after hearing it: ""Great title tune, but the rest is kind of blah."" Gary, get the Smoke Rings writer to write you another one. I'll buy it, too."
4,Awesome,Smoke Rings in the dark gives me the chills with it's haunting melody. I am going to rush right out and buy his previous cds to see if they are as awesome as this one.
2,KISMET (1955) (DVD MOVIE),"Sound - using both the Phillips DVD player - DVDR3360H and LG DVD player DR7922W were between one third and one half compared to other commercial DVD's. Constant humming probably due to 50HZ pick with the high audio setting required.Picture - was faultless on LG recorder. However, when played on the Phillips recorder, there were many sporadic breaks of typically 3 - 8 seconds of darkened screen and sound loss.May well be incapability problem, as no such effects have been found with other commercial DVD's. If so, this should have been advised on purchase."
4,Didn't do the music justice,"This movie version of the stage production is lush and visually beautiful. It does not do the music justice and actually leaves some out. Rhymes Have I is missing and the lovely 'And This Is My Beloved' quartet is emasculated. My personal suspicion is Vic Damone couldn't carry it off. If you want the music, all the music and the best performance get the Original Broadway Cast Album."
2,"""Heavy Handed""","That was Howard Keel's own description of the film, and it is accurate. And critic Ethan Mordden said the film managed to ""drain the sensuality out of one of Broadway's steamiest musicals."" Keel and Delores Gray are the only two cast members who manage to make something out of their roles in the production. Ann Blyth and Vic Damone are insipid. Sebastian Cabot is less menacing than a teddy bear. How this came out so leaden with Vincente Minnelli directing is impossible to figure out. A sad affair that did nothing to prolong the life of the Hollywood musical."
5,"Fun, catchy, I love this movie!","This is not an historically accurate, intellectual movie. This is a fun and catchy and stick-in-your-head musical romp. I've been looking for this movie on DVD for years and can't wait for April! I have the soundtrack to tide me over til then. It's actually one of my favorite musicals from this time period because it does what a movie is supposed to do...it entertains!"
1,A Wretched Transfer,"If you've ever seen the laser disc (which was a near perfect transfer) of this title, you'd be horrified at this VHS transfer. Pan and scan travesty. Awful color. Fair audio. I only bought it to have a complete version after a malfunctioning laser disc player scratched one side of my LVD version beyond recovery. Hopefully this title will be decently transferred to DVD some day."
3,Uninspired and slow musical.,"The best things about this movie are the impressing scenery and costumes. Unfortunately, most of the musical numbers are rather forgettable and too many and they make the movie very slow so you lose interest.An otherwise good director, Vincente Minelli, and some good actresses (Ann Blyth and Dolores Gray) can't compensate the too slow story. The movie also feels too much as filmed theater. It sure has some fine scenes, like the wedding procession and some of the dance sequences, but as a whole, the movie feels uninspired and isn't entertaining enough. I suggest you spend your money on some other movie instead."
1,An excellent broadway show becomse a vile movie,"simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only one worse was the Congqueror with John Wayne, but at least that one was funny.The choreography was poor, the dancing uninspired, Charlie McCarthy (Edgar Bergen's dummy) would have been less wooden than many of the actors, a few were so badly miscast it was pathetic and some of the best songs were omitted."
5,Fantastic,"I met Jimmy Edward when he came to Tucson and sang at the old Coyotes nightclub on Lester Street. I was walking to the door thru the parking lot and his crew drove up in their van. He was cool, we talked for a few minutes and he said thanks for coming to watch his show. On stage, he threw down. The opener was Adalberto."
2,OK magnifier,"It works, but I found the magnifier to be a bit small for most needs and the light seems to have occasional issues (loose switch). I had to put duct tape over the battery compartment to keep from losing the cover and battery."
4,why we need dutch punk rock...,"This, the first album from Undeclinable Ambuscade was a punk revelation..a band that played hard and fast but instead of screaming about not being able to talk to girls, they actually had something intelligent to say....The album twin lead guitars coupled with the frenetic kickdrum keeps the bpms high, and the vocals cover topics such as the ozone layer, animal testing, battered husbands, failed bank heists and suicide......and they can laugh at themselves too..listen to African song and you'll know what I mean.It only gets the 4 stars as it wanes slightly on the last 3 tracks but i would recommend it to any alternative punker..shame on Epitaph from dropping them."
1,Horrible,Whoever wrote the script is an idiot and why is there no score? What a waste of talent. Same guys with a good script = 40 year old virgin = funny. How does something like this even get produced? Total crap.
1,Such a Bummer!~,"I'm so bummed because this has a great cast, but this movie was awful! Do not waste the hours of your life! This was so terrible! View some other great movie by Paul Rudd and be happy!"
1,Not a funny film,"There are films similar to this out there, where a person comes into someone's life and totaly disrupts it. Planes, Trains, and Automobiles is a good example, where Steve Martin and John candy bond as they share misadventures when they try to get home during Christmas when their flight is cancelled. However, this film is so contrived and the character Barry acts so ridiculous that it was horrible to watch. A total waste of time."
2,boring!,"I rented this movie because all my friends said it was hilarious. I watched it, i thought it was boring. I dont see the reason everyone said this movie was really funny because it wasnt!!"
2,"Egh, don't bother","Look, I love Steve Carell, I've seen all of The Office and laughed my heart out. I love Paul Rudd and even the guy from Bored to Death, but this is one wildly unfunny movie, wow. Strange and yet predictable. I just finished it less than 10 minutes ago and I already forget the plot. I gave it 2 stars not 1 because I love everyone in it, we all make mistakes, they should all yell at their agents. Honestly, this is like the world's longest SNL skit. Watch something, anything, else."
1,Movie for schmucks...,"I have low standards - it takes very little to entertain me. I generally go to movies with my teens or younger kids so I don't expect complicated literary plots or sophisticated humor. I went to this movie as a fan of both Steve Carrell and Paul Rudd and just wanting to be amused for an hour and a half. Instead, I was mostly bored by the totally predictable plot and the plodding story line. Some of the characters, such as the artist, are just plain silly, and the love interest is there only as eye candy, something I thought movies were beyond these days. There were a couple of scenes that made me laugh, but mostly it made me yawn and wish I could turn on my iphone and play some games to pass the time. Don't waste your money or your time."
1,A film for schmucks,Not funny in the least. A big letdown for a Paul Rudd and a Steve Carrell film. Absolutely DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME on this one!
2,Just Ok,"This movie was a little dissapointing. It is one of those movies that could have been really great, and really funny, but it may have tried to hard and just ended up lacking."
4,You're a Schmuck if You Don't Give This a Shot!,"I thought this was a wonderful movie and am quite surprised by all the 1 star reviews. Not Steve Carell's best effort, but certainly not 1 star worth! I have a feeling it was a case of ""you expected to see more Steve, and less Paul"" so you gave it low reviews. Paul Rudd was wonderful too, very convincing and chose the right path.Shame on all the one star reviewers on Amazon."
1,If you watch / rent this then YOU are a schmuck!!,"Well, chalk me up as a schmuck! Waited for this to come on HBO (was leery about wasting a buck at redbox), and now I want those 2 hours of my life back. An absolutely horrible movie; on a whole not funny at all. Sure there were one or two funny zingers, but nowhere near enough to make this a comedy. Very disappointing considering the pedigree of the cast (Carell, Rudd). I feel bad for everybody that paid to see this at the theatre, bought it or rented it. I understand that the concept was based on a French film, which I am told was funny. Of course someone told me this version was funny too. I think this is one of those... ""I am going to tell people it was good, so that they get bilked outta some cash too"" movies. Seriously, do not waste your time, even two hours spent starring at a blank wall would be time better spent!"
4,Very Enjoyable.,"I found this movie to be a lot of fun. Steve Carell was amazing. He really went above and beyond in his role here.Tim (Paul Rudd) is an up and coming business tycoon that is forced into going to a special dinner if he wants the promotion. The theme of the dinner is a contest for the biggest loser you can find. In walks Barry (Steve Carell). Julie (Stephanie Szostak) is Tim's girlfriend and is very upset that he would even entertain this idea and leaves to go work with the artist Kieran (Jemaine Clement). Barry volunteers to help Tim, whether he wants his help or not, and almost ruins everything.This is a hilarious movie, with a lot of ""Oh my God, I can't believe he's that stupid"" moments. A great movie to watch with friends. You won't be disappointed."
4,Overall it was pretty good,"I wasn't much of a fan of it the first time I saw it. I found parts of it to be embarrassing for the characters, but when I watched it the second, third.....times I liked it more and more. As of now I find it to be a good comedic movie with some very humorous moments and some very touching moments. If you like Paul Rudd or Steven Carrell then its worth seeing it... give it shot or two. It's not my favorite comedy but it definitely grew on me and now I'll watch it now and again just for fun (but I also have a substantial movie collection of over 300 movies to watch when I'm in the mood for a movie). Personally, I think you'll either like it or it'll grow on you OR you just won't care for it."
2,Worth A Rental But Not To Buy,This movie isn't all that entertaining. It's worth a rental but I would not buy it even in the $5 bin.
3,eh.,"I thought it would be funnier, considering the cast. Good lines here and there.It was good to see Jemaine from Flight Of The Conchords."
3,Eat a finger,"This movie is cute. I would watch it again on a cold rainning night when i have a cold and my nose is so stuffed up that nothing will come out, not from the indigestion, but from the inflamation due to a sinus infection! Funny stuff. I love that part when he gave him the artists phone number.... 111-1111 lol... And the word ""WET"" comes to my mind, refuring to one part in the movie... funny stufff... the stuffing of a turkey but with out thanksgiving............"
1,More inappropriate than the French version and very disappointing,"I have to admit that I did not have very high expectations for this movie, having seen and loved the original ""Le Dner de Cons"" in French. My low expectations were brought lower when I saw the amount of disgusting sexual language and the all-out stupid lines and scenes in the film. I honestly would've rated this movie as R because I sat next to my 12-year-old sister who hadn't even heard of some of the graphically sexual terms and actions they were using and so we fast forwarded through about 20 minutes of that. I would list ""The Dinner Game (Le Dner de Cons)"" in my top 5 favorite movies because of the simple and hilarious comedy, and the amazing subtlety of the whole film is beautifully perfect! This remake is the polar opposite, very few truly funny scenes with no nuance whatsoever - blatant and crude!The Dinner Game- Buy this original version of the movie - it's 1000 times better!"
1,Awful,"This film stars several talented actors, yet the result is plain awful. Hated it from the first minute until the end. I do not recommend for those who really want to laugh because you will be disappointed."
1,"Awful movie, so bad, stupid","I was looking forward to watching this light hearted comedy all week, when i sat down to watch, i was amused the first fifteen minutes and after that whoaaaaaaaaaa, did it go downhill. I made myself watch the whole thing and boy I am still recovering from the monumental waste of time. The acting was fine in the flick, but the story makes one wonder who is running the movie studios these days. Are they complete jackasses or adolecent boys?"
1,Keep your money,"I (sometimes) enjoy the comedy of Steve Carell (as in ""Get Smart,"" but this movie is not worth watching. Vulgar, stupid, and shallow are terms that come to mind to describe the story line and dialogue. The acting is not bad, but unless you think like a 13 year old boy, skip it."
2,"Has its moments, but is otherwise forgetable","I have to say, when I first saw the reviews for this movie online, I thought people were being overly critical of an otherwise good movie. However, I have to say, after renting this movie from Netflix over the weekend, I have to say that, the reviews are spot on. Overall, this movie has its moments, but it certainly has earned its criticisms because with the exception of a few rare moments of good wit, this movie would have been a waste of $20 to buy and only end up watching just once. This way, I watch it once, return it, and then I never have to see it collecting dust on my shelf ever again. If given a chance to recommend this movie, I would say to keep looking because this movie would be a waste of an evening."
1,Waste of money,"I read the mixed reviews on this, watched the trailer numerous times and thought the storyline could be funny, so finally rented Dinner for Schmucks. As someone else said, I was the Schmuck. The ""storyline"" was non-existent. It was by far the most worthless movie I've ever wasted time watching.The only funny parts of the movie were the bits in the trailer. The actual Dinner for Schmucks was at the end of the movie and the stuff leading up to it was pointless, bizarre junk. I love Steve Carrell, but even he couldn't make this movie worthwhile. Don't waste your time or money."
2,Way too long & other problems,"This movie clocks in at nearly 2 full hours. The dinner scene (which is most of what was shown in the trailer) doesn't occur until the last third of the movie, so there are plot lines and long scenes which should have been cut or reduced since they make the movie just drag along. There were some funny parts, but this movie just couldn't keep the comedy up for that long.My other complaint is the tone was very mixed. It tries to be over-the-top funny, somewhat serious, a farce and black comedy all in one movie. I've never seen the French version, so maybe that one is more succesful with its tone, but this movie seemed all over the place. Overall, it was in need of some serious editing."
2,Like A Train Wreck---I Still Watched It,"This is supposed to be a remake of a French film; I haven't seen the French version, which is just as well, because a film should stand on its own merits.With the exception of several, isolated, instances, this comedy is not funny. The problem is the script and therefore the directing, pure and simple, not the acting. Regardless of the French version, this is another instance of an old, re-rehashed theme beaten to death by Hollywood: a social misfit who accidentally creates havoc gets superglued to the straight guy, driving him bonkers, but by the end of the film the misfit endears himself to the straight guy and even saves him from some problem or other. Like I said, an old, old cliche done to death (You Me and Dupree is a relatively recent one, for example; What About Bob? had the saving grace that the straight guy never embraces the misfit and is instead driven mad)."
2,Missed the Mark --- Spoiler Free Review,"I love Steve Carell, don't get me wrong, but I did not like his performance here. Actually, his performance was okay, its just that the script just wasn't right as far as his part was concerned. It didn't feel organic. (I only made it through 1/2 the movie before I shut it off)Interestingly enough, my favorite parts of the movie are the parts in which Steve's character is absent. In fact, if they had completely removed his character and just wrote a script without that character, this movie would have been better.Again, not to say Steve's performance wasn't decent, but rather, the script as far as his character was concerned just didn't work for me.Also, parts of the script felt contrived, moreso than a comedy should.I guess, I feel the entire script just needed another draft/editing session.Basically, this is one of those things that was a great idea, but the execution was lacking. So it is a miss for me"
1,Stupid and Tedious,"This film gets sidetracked by too many many feints, slants, and twists. It takes a rather simple plot and transforms it into a complex, unending and admittedly stupid film rife with unsympathetic characters. Yes, there was an occasional belly laugh, but otherwise this movie came across as a very unpleasant and tedious viewing experience."
1,Stupid,"Give me a break people that rated this anything above 1 star. The comedy was ridiculous, it's an insult to adults to think they would fine this funny. Both my wife and I turned it off after 20 minutes. You want to waste your time and money, then pay and watch this."
1,The Dinner Game,"Dinner for Schmucks is a take off of the French film ""The Dinner Game"" with a copyright of 1998. There are a few similarities but ""Schmucks"" doesn't hold a candle to ""The Dinner Game"". You'll get ten times more laughs out of the French version (with subtitles) and much better acting. Save your money."
2,Total failure,This comedy fails in every area. The only entertaining bit is the dinner at the very end and that isn't even nearly enough to watch the whole thing. Total waste and very little funny moments.
3,Kristin Schaal would have been the perfect Darla !!!,"Kristin Schaal is the perfect blend of innocent seduction. She would have made the role of Darla absolutely hilarioius. What a shame Darla's role went to someone who misinterpreted the character. Maybe it was the director's mistake. We would have given more stars except Lacy Punch overdid the role as Darla adding a raunchy aspect to the film that didn't need to be there. Our family likes the original French ""Le Diner de Cons"" so my husband and I screened Dinner for Schmucks, fast forwarding through nearly every scene with Darla because they were unbearable and needlessly suggestive. Lacy Punch can't seem to keep her raunchy behavior under control and over did it, just like she did when she was on the British ""Doc Martin"" series until she was presumably replaced after a few episodes. Needless to say, our teenage kids won't be watching this."
4,great movie,I have no idea what the idiots who gave this movie a one star rating are thinking. We should probably ask them all out for dinnner. This was a great laugh!!!! If you are renting a movie like this and looking for momentum then GET A LIFE and quit collecting dead mice. Great Movie!!!!!!!!!!
1,A poor remake of a classic.,"If you want to laugh non-stop, watch the original French film entitled ""Le Diner de Cons"" also released with the English title ""The Dinner Game."" Don't waste your time with this remake."
1,awful...more like movie rental for shmucks,"This was just awful. I saw PG- 13, but it should of been R for its raunchy style comedy. I didnt watch..I tried skipping ahead but it didnt improve and still the same junk being thrown at you for comedy sake. These men can do comedy..i have seen it..and this one was not that..it was how they made an easy buck. I feel the schmuck for renting it and wasting my money. BLAH!"
3,"The smartest of the ""dumb"" combenies.",This movie is highly recommended for anyone and everyone who do not like dumb combeny movies. Also for those who prefer smart combeny moves.
2,The best part is the credits,"I'm not kidding. The credits where they show what Steve Carrell does with dead mice is really funny. I wish the whole movie had been that inventive. Mostly, I didn't like what Paul Rudd was doing to Carrell and thought his girlfriend should have dumped him a long time ago. Everybody in the movie is a jerk and that's only funny for so long before it becomes annoying. Not recommended at all."
2,Surprisingly lackluster,"From the trailer, you would think this movie would actually be about a dinner for schmucks, but that is not even what MOST of the film is about! The dinner only happens near the end, so most of the story comes across as irrelevant, and does not make full use of the comedic abilities of many of the characters. Rather disappointing."
1,Sad excuse for a comedy,"I usually don't write a review at 3am right after watching a movie, but I felt like I had to for this one. This movies fails in all categories.When watching movies, I like to remember that they are just movies and leave emotions out of it. Every once in a while a movie will capture me, making me feel happy, sad, fearful, etc, all most of the time in a positive manner. This movie was not a positive one. This movie was NOT funny. It is an embarrassment to the cast of good actors. This movie was awkward, depressing, weird, disturbing, childish, and horrible in every way imaginable. I can't believe I just wasted two hours of my wonderful life watching this appalling ""movie"". I'm glad that it was only a Netflix rental; I would be beyond myself if I would have paid to see this in theaters.If you like this cast of characters, and have high hopes for this movie like I did, please do yourself a favor and DON'T WATCH IT!!!"
1,I'm curious to see...,"...what the DVD extras are going to be. What could possibly enhance the comedic masterpiece that was the theatrical version of ""Dinner For Schmucks""? The director's commentary read in a loopy French accent? Outtakes in which the actors are randomly pelted with cream pies by midgets? A hidden audio track wherein key pieces of dialogue are replaced with flatulent sound effects? A musical cameo featuring Will Ferrell and Jack Black riding atop a donkey? A copy of the contract Zack Galifianakis signed when he sold his soul? Seriously - it's hard to improve upon perfection; I don't think I've laughed so hard in all my life. And by ""laughed,"" I mean, ""wept bitterly for our society and the last lingering shreds of our collective intelligence."""
1,Horrible,Please do not waste your money on this movie it was totally not funny and embarassing to the lead actors whom I think are good just not in this turkey!
2,"Wishful and hopeful, disappointed.","I really thought the reviews would be wrong, I mean look at the cast! Paul Rudd is one of my favorites. Steve is always 50/50 with me, I either love him or don't. I pray those are not real mice they used, disturbing. The idea was creative, the flow of the movie was choppy at best and sadly I DIDN'T LAUGH once. I really want a laugh last night, however. not a chuckle. I would give it one star, but that seems so mean."
1,About Dinner for Schmucks,"Dinner for Schmucks has good actors , but is all about sex , reason why I hate itI have just bought it thinking of the main actor , but I am very dissapointed"
1,Its sucked,i thought this was going to be hilarious. Nope it sucked butt big time. I wouldnt buy it. Wish I knew that before I bought it
3,Good for a few laughs. Just a few.,"Tim (Paul Rudd)is trying desperately to impress his boss and get a promotion. One of the ways he can do that is to invite idiots to dinner so all the coworkers can make fun of them. To enjoy this movie you have to possess the same sense of humor as the coworkers who do the inviting because the majority of the film's attempted humor is centered around the antics of these ""special"" individuals. The intro to the movie was clever. I love the concept of the mouse art and some of the situational comedy worked (like the ones with the Stalker) however towards the middle it began to feel dragged out and tiresome. I can't say anything negative about the actors because they were all very good. I just think the movie could have benefited from being shorter and with better writing material to work with. Dinner for Schmucks was redeemed in the last 30 minutes with the happy resolution to all the conflicts presented. Overall, it's an okay movie."
3,It is not a watch-once movie,"I liked this movie it is funny and sweet. I think it is not a watch-once movie, you might want to watch it for couple of times before you get bored of it.The start of the movie is so wonderful and sweet and sometimes I found the character of (Steve Carell) little annoying but afterword I understood the personality that he want to represent. There few moments in the movie that you find (Paul Rudd) showing off his comedy side in new way.There are few scences that I feel they are not neccessary for the movie but it is ok still funny movie."
4,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"To be honest, I find most movies in the ""stupid funny"" genre to just be stupid and a waste of time, but I like Paul Rudd and Zack Galifianakis so I gave it a shot, and I'm glad I did. It was definitely one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while."
3,Entertaining,"I have seen better comedies, but this is okay. It does have a good understory. I did like the little background scenes with the mice that showed the life story of the breakup of the marriage of the schmuck that he was taking to the dinner. A cute touch."
2,I was the Schmuck,"I waited almost the entire movie for this to get funny. I realized that it was the last 15 minutes that concentrated the humor that could have been throughout the whole film. I'm not glad I watched it, and I'll never watch it again. The actual dinner (which took too long to get to, in my opinion) was chock full of fun and laughs, but it didn't make up for the movie as a whole."
2,This is the weirdest movie EVER!,The movie was BAD but its like I couldn't look away I'm actually writing this review as I finish the end of it.. lol I truly thought it would be better and I am so happy I didn't waste time or money seeing this in the theater... Its just so off the wall and corny YET its had a couple of funny sweet moments & I just had to see how it ended! I absolutely LOVE the Steve Carell in the 40 y/o Virgin and the majority of his movies but this will NOT be one added to the DVD collection. Thanks so MUCH for redbox and $1 rentals!
1,Stop remaking great movies!,"As most of you already know, this is a REMAKE of the French movie Le Dner de Cons. It's a lame and unfunny remake. Paul Rudd is in his comfort zone, and Carell is just alright. The ""schmuck"" in the French movie is far more REAL and likable. The way the movie flows is just boring and doesn't make much sense. I only wish they would stop remaking, and thus ruining, great movies."
2,Wasn't what I expected,Given who was in it I thought it would be better. The diner scenes took about 10 minutes. The rest of the movie was incoherent. Had some funny moments.
1,WHAT THE HECK?,"I love Sarah. I really looked forward to this release. The one star is for the discs. This is supposed to have 10 episodes, 5 on each disc. Instead I have 4 episodes on the first disc, and 1 episode on the second. Where are the other 5 episodes? Are they hidden and I am too dumb to find them? Is this a joke that I just don't get? Or is this just a really stupid mistake? Did I just pay 20 bucks for 5 episodes? Somebody help me here!"
3,sabotaged collection,i bought this dvd set expecting the usual best and there's an episode missing from each disc(10 episodes 2 discs?) no commentary track no animated shorts no behind the scenes as described on the packaging and the broadcast of the new season is being sabotaged already! i think i may be done with this show!!
3,"Not the ""Spanky/Alfalfa"" episodes you remember. Not restored.","Of course, the content is amazing. No one since has gotten performances out of kids like you'll find on these shorts. Word of warning, they're racist as hell... well as racist as people were in the 20s and 30s, which is... very. Also, until later years, these didn't have much of a plot or story. Mostly some cute kids getting forced into weird situations and filmed with a few slapstick moments.The quality on the other hand... not so good. Audio is sometimes very hard to understand, and I'm not just talking about Buckwheat. Someone said these were taken from the Cabin Fever restorations... that is a lie. I have a few of those on VHS and they're another world of quality. Sadly, they're gone and hard to find. So if you're looking to get the Our Gang comedies for a decent price, I guess this series is pretty good, but it's no ""Cabin Fever"" for cheap."
4,I'm surprised it's still in one piece!,"I bought this case a few years ago and have been using and abusing it on long road trips, off road rides, rain, snow, etc, and it still works great! The quick detach feature and the capacity to hold a men's large full face helmet are the primary reasons I bought this case (and it's a fraction of the price of other brands). It's not the most rigid case built but it doesn't shake or vibrate whatsoever and hasn't cracked yet!"
4,Handy Travel Trunk,"Handy trunk. I have needed an unobtrusive trunk for my 1100cc Honda Shadow Spirit that would fit the tail rack and not look too funky. It's tall enough to fit a 3/4 helmet, shirt, gloves and a few more small items. Or it'll bring a couple of large white styrofoam leftover carriers home from the restaurant with room to spare. It could be built a little heavier, like the Givi scooter trunks. I don't expect it to be as stout as Givi's motorcycle cases. If it was heavier gauge I'd have given it 5 stars."
3,"Okay, but beware","Depending on your bike you will have to drill holes for this. I thought that I could just bolt to the rack using the existing holes to my Vstrom, but was wrong. There are brackets that you can ""make work"", but is not suited for the bike.On a positive side the trunk does lock tight, holds a full face helmet and more, and looks great. If the compatibility with the bike was not an issue then it would get 5 stars."
1,Remastering is fantastic,"Have you ever wanted to listen to the music of the 30's, but couldn't stand the poor sound quality and noise?Listen to Jasmine's jazz collections-it feels like you've been transported back to the 30's to listen to the music the way it was meant to sound on the radios of the day.Simply superb!"
3,Great kit ... but not great value for your money,"My daughter (6) put this on her wishlist for Christmas and finally got it for her birthday. She loves it. It's educational and fun. But it is over priced. It's basically photocopied papers with a very cheap magnifying glass, cheap butterfly net, cheap binoculars, plaster mix and mesh. If the price is not a consideration, then go for it. She loves it and received it as a gift ... so we're all happy here. I would suggest you put in on your child's wishlist and have someone else overspend!"
4,Good product,I bought this kit for a 9 year old boy who really the outdoors. He loves it and is always using it. The instructions and suggestions inside are useful. It is a product that is easy for a child to use independently or with a parent. A lot of fun! Good product!
4,Good for a very young child who loves nature walks,"While I agree with the review that said the contents were a bit cheap and cheesy, this was a Christmas gift for a three-year-old. Her mother had said she loved nature walks, and our granddaughter was delighted with it - wanted to go hunting bugs and butterflies immediately, in the snow. We can get her better binoculars, etc., when she's old enough to need and appreciate them. For a very young child who loves nature walks, this proved to be a great gift."
5,"Not your ""Dime a Dozen"" album.","Girl for Samson offers a refreshing drink in a parched landsape with ""12."" The shadow in the lyrics and musical patterns will cling to you long after you've turned it off and you'll hear something new the next time you play it. Fantastic effort by this KC band."
3,Interesting Album - * * *,"I found the variety of styles on this record very entertaining. Kind of a smorgasboard of 60s-80s rock. The songs and performances are very good though the production at times seems a little muddy. Also, the album seems to start with a bang, wander around in the middle and then finish strong. Overall a fun album and I love the cover!"
3,liked it,"The album's got it's share of stinkers but when these guys are on, they're matching wits with ""the white album"" and ""midnight vultures."" Was worth sitting through to find my favs.Avoid the tune ""delerious,"" program ""flap"" into your ipod.strident."
1,Truly Shoddy work,"Nathan once said at a conference I was attending that he writes what sells and won't write what does not.This book like all of his work is shoddy from an academic standpoint. While it might be interesting to read, there is no substantial merit to anything Nathan writes.He wants to denigrate China's leadership so that he can stay in the spotlight in the US and make money selling his books.Stay away from this book until Nathan actually backs up what he writes with solid evidence."
4,A Book which you can read on the bus,"This book is simple and incisive, but don't expect it can either give you something ""big"" nor improve your score significantly. It only introduces you what the new SAT is like. Those sample questions are the most worthy part of the book. Those so-called strategies are not really different from the old SAT bks except for the new sections which are added.This bk is really small that you can carry and read while you are waiting for the train or sitting on the dam bus with nothing to do. As it is not really expensive, i think the price is fair."
1,not worth the money even tho its cheap!,"No $5 isn't alot, but mine would have been better spent on a magazine. Not good. Recycled material, just a marketing strategy!Buy a real book instead. TPR is always better than Kaplan anyhow."
4,"Great product, but how do you clean it???","I love these. They heat evenly, the glass covers are perfect to cook with, the plastic I use for leftover storage and for transportation, they're pretty... well, they were pretty. Every use makes each white piece a little duller. How do you all clean these? The best luck I had was with a de-greasing dish liquid and a scrubbie, but it was an awful lot of work. Any suggestions???"
2,Certainly not worth $20,"I received this set as a gift. It is cute and made out of good quality plastic, I'll give it that much. I use the snack cups the most; they have a neat little spinning lid. But the sippy cups are worthless. They have a completely open spout and liquid pours out. I can't even get the lid on one of the cups, and if I do manage to get it on, I can't get it off without liquid going all over the kitchen. I keep the fork and spoon in the diaper bag--couldn't care less if they got lost. I'll probably use the cups without their lids when my daughter is older, so it won't be completley wasted. But truly, this set is not worth $20. Spend it on good quality sippy cups and utensils."
1,Don't Buy This!!!,I didn't like this product AT ALL! The sippy cups were too small and it was all cheaply made. I got my money back.
4,Real Hula,I have enjoyed this DVD Very much. I have resently moved to a place where a Hula group is not available. This DVD has been a great help in keeping up the things that I have learned as well as learning some new steps and practice!!!!!!!!!
4,Basic Hula DVD,"Great intensive old style hula instruction and practice video. No booklet included,although it is indicated on DVD packaging, but video was enough on its own."
2,"Boring, very elementary video!","I have had many years of professional dance experience, but not in hula, and wanted to learn it. However, this is very much a beginner's level video for someone who has never studied dance before. The instructor breaks down every movement in such detail and in such a quiet, monotone voice that you almost fall asleep watching it. The dance demonstration also moves too slow. It is very boring and I never did finish watching it. Very disappointing."
3,You get what you pay for,"In all honesty, I bought this because it was the cheapest CD/tape/tuner combo on Amazon at the time I got it. This is probably the reason you're looking at it, too. It's not a bad system, but don't expect the features that a nicer (and more expensive) system offers. For example, the remote control isn't all that great--it doesn't have numbers on it, only a few poorly designed buttons, so you can't quickly switch between presets--you can just scroll through them. Also, you can't use the remote to switch between functions (tuner, CD, tape)--you have to manually do that on the unit itself. And the remote doesn't work for the tape decks. Also, the unit has no audio-in ports, so you can't run your computer through it or tape something off of anything else. I expected a little more."
2,Just so so,"I don't really understand why so many people rated it with 5 stars? It's not worth it. The sound is poor, espacially the bass. I don't like it at all."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this stereo based on the customer reviews and of course the low price. I returned it. The CD player worked for only a few hours before conking out. The digital tuner did not tune stations as well as I can with my other, non-digital radios. But most of all I was disappointed with the sound quality. It was very poor in my opinion and sounded like I was listening to it in the bathroom."
5,SURPRISING VALUE for this price.,"I purchased this unit after reading the other reviews, but still had a surprise coming! The unit is better than I had anticipated. The look is great, and the speaker quality is as good as units costing a lot more. I wanted a good radio - for listening to Public Radio, and also the sound quality to listen to my classical CDs. The small remote is more than adequate. I would recommend this minisystem to anyone - and it fits on a shelf very neatly!!"
5,"Restored power, vehicle no longer sluggish.","Took our 99 Blazer with 57k miles in to see why there was no power. Engine just bogged and took forever to speed up, even at wide open throttle. There was no check engine light and the scan tool did not show any troubles.Took the vehicle home and found this product and ordered a can. Took me about 3 minutes to remove the MAF sensor and sprayed about 1/2 can on the sensor. The sensor was black before we started and bright silver when I was done. Reinstalled the MAF sensor and the power increase was noticed immediatly. Can only imagine it helped the fuel economy too."
5,Great product,This great product is added to my '95 vehicle to keep the new air flow sensor clean along with the new catalytic converter that was installed recently. The addition of those new products with the mass air flow sensor cleaner gives my old vehicle better mileage.
5,Mass Air Cleaner,"This is the BEST Mass Air Flow Cleaner I have ever used.I have been cleaning autofuel systems since 1953. I worked in a small repair shop and it was my job to clean carbs,fuel lines, and filters before the mechanics would disassemble them.There was a noticeable improvement in my Toyota with only 134K miles on it."
3,Didn't Work for my,"The Mass Air Flow Sensor on my Ford f150 had a crust of dirt. I use this product to try to clean it but could not. I had to use heavy duty degreaser and a small brush to remove dirt, then rinse with water, wait until dry and ready.I only clean the sensor electrodes with degreaser with a small brush, very carefully. Do you think the air is very soft and delicate?, the air erodes the rocks of the mountains. Sensor electrodes withstands some degreaserI know this procedure is not correct but to me it worked, you just have to let it dry and will not have any problem."
3,I think it did its job,"I think it did its job of cleaning the air flow sensor, but I did not see any difference in vehicle performance etc.,"
5,Sometimes the opening act is better than the headliner,"I saw Damien Dempsey, recently, as the opener for Morrissey. The experience of listening to his voice was pure magic. There are many flowery things I can say, that most reviewers and critics would write, but from the heart of a woman that understands the music of Ireland, Scotland and Briton...Damien Dempsey is all heart and soul. A must have for sure."
3,Description,"He was arrogant as the devil and cold as ice - a ready made adversary!Brash, brazen, hard-hitting journalist Maggie Howard had covered war zone and interviwed dictators without learning how to stand up for herself. She didn't do soft stories so her resentment was already high when she was assigned to do a feature article on famed equestrian Felipe de Santis, and as far as she was concerened this assignment in Andalucia was no diffrent from the rest.Then she met Felipe, and immediately two forceful personalities clashed, arrogance and pride met blow for blow. He was used to giving orders and expected Maggie to defer to him. She would do things her way, and if Felipe didn't like it he knew what he could do. What she wasn't used to was the sort of campaign he wagged in order to get his own way... But it wasn't until Felipe accused her of being afraid to be a woman that Maggie knew this time the outcome of her story was completely beyond her control!"
1,If I could give it less than a 1 star I would!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THis is one of the worst scams I have ever been exposed to. This video plus shipping and handling cost me about $15, but I would maybe buy it for $1. It is such a short video clip and the music is so slow (or just not fun) that my kid lost interest within the first few moments.DO NOT BUY THIS! It is the biggest waste of money ever!"
1,Not good,This DVD is not really what we were looking for. My daughter doesn't like it at all. I wish the description gave u all the songs on it. And if didn't. I took a chance ANC never will again
3,Amusing!,"I got this from the library for my kids to watch. They loved it! It is not well made, but they just loved singing along. The Kidz Bop kids lip sync and do a poor job of it, but my kids didn't seem to care. It has a high amusement factor if you choose to watch with your kids. I was laughing so hard that I had to turn away so as not to offend my kids. I always appreciate humor in kid's programs since they tend to watch their favorites over and over....and over.....again!"
5,a fascinating account of human similarities to animals,"This book opened my eyes to various traits once consideredunique to humans over animals. Mr. Diamond lists and providesexamples from the animal kingdom which debunk our ideas ofuniqueness. I found the text lucid, thought-provoking, andoccasionally very humorous. If you think you are in controlof your ideas and ethics, then this book is a neccesary read."
5,answers to questions we've always asked,"In The Third Chimpansee, Jared Diamond presents a marvelous analysis of the human animal. Observing us like a visitor from outter space, the author discusses humanity from a perspective that incorporates both the social and the biological factors. The incredible sense made when seeing through Diamond's eyes will stir the brain of every reader. This book is a must for all those interested in evolutionary biology and biological anthropology. If you've ever wondered why humans act the way they do, Diamond will certainly offer an insight that will captivate your entire mind."
5,Prophetic about extinction,"Nothing too new but reworked in an inimitable and warm style. Eye opening about the wildlife our species has anhialated and very prophetic about future extinctions happening right now.Bringing in such disparate topics like Indo-european languages and genocide, Diamond succeeds in demolishing the statement ""science is inhuman"". The book's very strength is that it is not too scientific (science being in its strict form a narrow minded religion).Cannot be too highly commended for those who value biodiversity."
4,The Third Chimpanzee Review,"The book is in pretty good shape. It is clearly used, but in good enough shape that it is serving its purpose well. The book itself offers experimental evidence, mixed with the opinion of the author to explain evolutionary phenomena. It is both thought provoking and informative."
4,Well written,"After reading this book, I decided that I should read all books written by the author. Jared has a gift and he uses it well. His style is very interesting and he even manages to get a few laughs out of the reader once in a while. The title of the book in itself is intriguing. The author discusses several theories and then goes on to explain to the reader which, in his opinion, is the most probable. I think everyone should read this book since no previous knowledge of the subject is needed. There is a lot of useful information that will really change the way we look at humans, humanity, animals and earth."
3,A Bit Too Academic,"I really enjoyed Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs and Steel"", and ""Collapse"", but this earlier effort is quite academic and difficult to engage. Although he does his best to personalize a lot of the anthropological stuff, at this point earlier in his career, he simply wasn't a very good writer compared to the one he became in his later efforts.To put it more plainly ""The Third Chimpanzee"" suffers from boring writing. Very intellectual, very academic, a little geeky at times. Good information, but certainly not accessible unless you are willing to work hard to understand it.The book unfortunately compares poorly to a better written book on roughly the same subject of human cultural evolution (and explains why we are they way we are), which is called ""Man the Moral Animal - the Emerging Field of Evolutionary Psychobiology"". Now, that's a great book."
5,"This book, like all Diamond's work just blew me away !","I cannot imagine why this awesome book is not available on Kindle.The thing I love about Jared Diamond's work is that every one of his books has an undercurrent of human empowerment in it. Diamond lays out what is known on a subject and then starts playing with the ideas, and bringing in supporting facts and studies to explain his conclusions. They are often diametrically opposed to what we hear our learned and well paid media propagandists tell us every day.So many great comparisons and contrasts between human beings and animals that sheds so much light on both. Another trait of Diamonds work is how bone chilling the revelations of our species' suicidal ignorance is.This book, like ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" and ""Collapse"" are included in my top-shelf favorite and are the ones I always have loaded on all my electronic devices.I sure would like the read this and annotate on my Kindle, there is so much to this book it's hard to keep it all in mind."
4,ITS OUR NATURE TO TRASH THE ENVIRONMENT!,"The author accuses we humans of inflicting an environmental holocaust that started some 40 thousand years ago, is presently accelerating, and will climax within the new century. He alleges that in our past we murdered all the Neanderthals and hunted to extinction most of the big mammals and other large animals that roamed in our path. Other extinctions were caused or encouraged by the pests (i.e. rats) that were spread as we expanded worldwide. The trend will supposedly continue since environmental destruction is a human hallmark. While this message may seem unsurprising to we cynics, a great deal of information and speculation is provided that is fresh and provocative."
3,An honest picture of humanity and its origins,"Borrowing insight from a multitude of scientific fields, Diamond retells the human story in unwavering honesty. He places a spotlight on human sexuality and aging, the role of linguistics and art, and our adoption of agriculture and animal husbandry, not forgetting to mention our seemingly innate propensities towards addiction, genocide, and fellow species extinction. See also ""The Moral Animal"" by Robert Wright."
3,"Not on a par with ""Guns, Germs & Steel'","This is an environmentalist manifesto, a strong idea but badly wrapped in this case. It starts with science and veers off rapidly into speculation and arm-waving. Diamond tries to integrate anthropology, biology and ecology but he hasn't done his homework, so he has filled much of this book with his personal opinions and unsupported conclusions and his earnest concerns about mankind's effect on the envirnoment. He has what may be a very good thesis, but his argument is ultimately very thin. It's a big diappointment compared to his widely read ""Guns, Germs and Steel"", which does a far better job of drawing together multiple disciplines."
1,Boring and dull,"After having read The Ancestors Tale by Dawkins and Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors by Sagan this book leaves little to be desired. I find myself getting frustrated at every turn. He asks a lot of questions but gives no answers. He goes on and on sometimes saying the same thing over and over again and never really going anywhere.The chapter that really got to me is the one called ""Why do we smoke, drink and use dangerous drugs?"" He speculates something that is way out in left field. From my studies of addiction I have learned that humans use addictive substances most likely because it stimulates the reward centers of the brain which also happen to be linked to our instinct for survival.I would love to throw this book in the trash."
3,Where's Diamond's Population Control?,"On page four one of many annoying parts of this book first appears. ""My twin sons"" (of fertility treatments?) is followed three sentences down by Diamond's plea for ""halting population growth."" See any problems here?"
5,"An excellent, easy to read overview of humanity","Wow. I can't stop thinking about this book, even though I finished it a month ago. I can see why Diamond is so in demand as a lecturer and author. He does what is difficult to do in science: speculates intelligently, and with authority. Even better, he labels his speculations as such. But once you hear his theories on a number of subjects, you won't be able to stop thinking about them. Although I am sure that Diamond might be wrong on such subjects on why we abuse drugs, he is so, so, very right in his observations and conclusions based on the evidence of many aspects of our culture, our strengths, and our weaknesses. You really should read this book. Everybody should."
4,Same book - different titles,"What I fail to see mentioned in any of the reviews thus far is the fact that this book (`The Third Chimpanzee') is essentially identical to a previous version under a different title by Jared Diamond, namely,"" The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee: How Our Animal Heritage Affects the Way We Live"" circa 1991. Interestingly, the reviews of that book (`The Rise and Fall') also fails to mention that it is a previous version of this updated book (`The Third Chimpanzee'). Upon comparison, the differences appear to be quite minimal; the general thrust is identical. Nothing about this relationship is mentioned at the Jared Diamond page either. However, please be aware that with very little effort the older version (`The Rise and Fall') can be found in a free PDF format."
4,great balck history month read,This is a book about Martin Luther King Jr. We learn that he stood for peace not violence. He wanted everyone to be treated equally no matter what color their skin was. Some people did not like the way Dr King went about things. They sent him mean letters and he even ended up in jail. Dr King never gave up or gave in to violence. He always stood strong in his beliefs.I learned a lot from this book. I knew a little about Martain Luther King Jr but this story taught he much more.This book would be helpful to elementary students when writing reports Martin Luther King Jr. There is a helpful time line with dates of important events listed in the back of the book. This is a great book to read during black history month.
2,"Short on information, insight","A very weak effort on a band deserving of a real bio. Most of the research appears to have been cribbed from publications like Circus, Contemporary Keybord and the like. The members are not interviewed, nor are the folks who could give real insight into the band and it's era: Stewart Young, Ahmut Ertegun, Godfrey Salmon and on and on. In the end it's a fannish puff piece that adds nothing to the story of rock's most (unjustly) reviled band."
2,Crap,"This book is too much of a whitewash, it doesn't take the band to task nearly enough for the horrible quality of Works II and Love Beach, and could have done a far better job of detailing the development of the musicians before they came together as a group. Do yourself a favor and keep your money in your wallet."
2,A slim travel guide in need of updating,"This is a good-looking, beautifully illustrated, and nicely packable little book about Bali that is short on maps. It isn't functional as a travel guidebook since it's out of date. Bali's tourism industry has been severely affected by 9/11 and the Bali bombing; this book was published before those events."
1,Big Disappointment - Should have check the copyright date 1993,"As a recently certified school library media specialist, I was excited to see this title. I purchased it without checking the date. Big mistake. The book has more information on card catalogs than computerized catalog systems. The information on planning and lessons was very basic. The ""chapter"" on dicipline is 9 pages long (3 pages of reproducibles). I was hoping for information on weeding, collection development and promoting the library to students, and actual lesson ideas. This book does not deliver. It may have been useful 14 years ago, but should not be considered today. Any introductory class on educational media or library science will cover all of this and more."
4,"More of a ""Beginner's Survival Guide""","Don't get me wrong - Ms. Bannister has done a laudable job with this ""instructional manual."" The only point I feel compelled to make is this ""survival guide"" is ""97%"" better suited for a first year school librarian. After a full year ""on the job"", most of her book's contents are researched and dealt with - by necessity. Read this book the summer before starting as a first year school librarian or after being away from the profession for a few years."
2,Needs To Be Updated,"Has some basic, good ideas, but needs to be updated. Most people can make up their own forms, charts, clip art, etc. and save on your hard drive. Pretty old, mostly outdated in the computer world... Nothing on ""media centers"" either..."
2,A little outdated,"At one time I believe this book would have been a vital lifesaver, but at this point, for me, it seems outdated. Each aspect of librarianship is covered, but the current level of technology in most school libraries is not taken into account. One chapter details how to switch a card catalog over to a computerized system. Today's new librarians have a very different perspective than the new librarians that would've found this to be useful. I wouldn't totally write this book off my list since some of the reproducible forms seem like they would be helpful. At the same time, I think newer looking versions of them might need to be created or located on the internet."
5,The Three Stooges Daily Desktop,"I was looking forward to having this little gem on my computer but alas it was not to be. I have a Mac computer and it will not load on a Mac. My mistake, I should have looked at the requirements before purchasing. I rated this item with 5 stars simply because I know it would have been fantastic."
3,Universal license plate bracket,"Basic, black plastic license plate bracket with four identical, galvanized, self-tapping machine screws for mounting frame to vehicle and license plate to frame. Simple and inexpensive; essentially a flat piece of semi-flexible plastic with slots and holes. Performs its essential function. Purchaser should consider the purchase of nut-and-bolt fasteners to attach the license plate as the machine screws extend far beyond the rear of the bracket and will penetrate the bumper surface when the plate is attached. Nothing fancy but after all, its sole function is to attach a license plate to a vehicle. Find an alternative if you don't want to drill holes into the visible face of the bumper."
3,"OK, but missing half of the pictured screws.",It should work fine to replace the flimsy plastic tabs on my camper. My package contained just two screws not the four pictured on Amazon and mentioned on the package installation instructions. So now I have to get two more stainless screws.
3,Plate Holder,"I thought this had magnets on it, it did not. It is ok made for what it is. I did not end up using it. I wanted to have a temp mount for a back up camera. Ended up using a magneting knife holer and another bracket."
3,"Great Player, but not for Rhapsody","I have had no problems with the T9 and the sound is great. The Samsung Digital Media software is adequate at best. However, have a week trying to get this to work with Rhapsody...I finally received this e-mail from Rhapsody:""You have signed up for Rhapsody To Go subscription. I regret to inform that as of now your device ""Samsung YP-T9 is officially not supported by Rhapsody To Go. (i.e) the device is not yet tested for Rhapsody To Go songs. That is the reason you receive this error message ""No license found"".I'm not sure how others previously have gotten theirs to work with this service, but it now 'officially"" is not compatible."
5,Excelent media player,"There is nothing I would change on this little guy. It's fast, innovative, and good looking. The controls are easy to use and navigates pretty well. The display is beautiful and bright. Sound quality is good.Some of the covers made by third parties make the scroll buttons hard to press and it can confuse the controls.I would highly recommend this player."
2,Video does not work; MP3 is great.,"I am not sure where to rate this puppy.Pros-- intuitive interface-- looks great!-- MP3 player works well-- great photo player-- excellent quality voice recordingHowever!!!!Cons-- I bought this b/c it did everything an IPOD does (although IPOD interface is still better), and it plays videos, has FM tuner etc, and is cheaper; but several of the features have major flaws:-- VIDEO DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PLAYER!!!!!! If you are getting this to play video then do not get this. I have scoured the interet about the video problem and many, many people are saying the same thing about the video.-- FM Tuner is very weak!!!!!-- Samsung software is WEEAAAKKKK!!!! and frustrating to use!!!!!Those are my three biggest gripes, and they are big gripes as the Video and FM tuner are two big reasons I got this player.Still, it does look sharp and the price is great for a 4GB. I got mine for $130 at Best Buy. I still like it but it hurts that video and FM Tuner do not work."
4,excelent value,"excelent mp3 player. the controls are just little uncomfortable to change features, but, the rest, five stars. I higly recommend it"
4,"It works, software issues though",It works okay. It's nice and small. The only issue I have is software recognizing the unit.
3,help!,"I love this player, but it won't work right. when I turn it on, it says ""Automatic Test"" in the middle, and on the lower right-hand corner, it says ""F/W v1.27"". Can someone please help me?Thanks***Update***Okay, I got that problem fixed by calling customer support. Now it turns on by itself (????). Can anyone help me with this?I love this player...I don't want to replace it yet."
1,Doesn't support WMA files,"This product is fine for those who want only mp3 files. However, it represents itself as supporting other formats. WMA (used for netlibrary audiobooks) does not work well (the audio skips). There are much better players for the money."
4,Competes well with iPod Nano,"This is an excellent mp3 player in this class. My daughter has a nano and my wife has this device, my daughter likes this one better.Pros: FM tuner works great, great display, video play back, equalizer settings, smaller than nano, voice recording is great, desktop software is straightforward.Cons: device had to be reformatted after second connection to desktop as it was not recognized anymore(samsung indicated to me that this is a well known problem that they are working on. The reformatting solved the problem, but wasted an hour of my time, as I had to reload all the content. The device and computer connection has worked flawlessly ever since.) Slightly slower operating system than ipod, although elegant."
3,Awesome for the $$$- while it works...,"I bought this about 8 months ago and I've loved it- it does everything the ipod does and more, for less money. I always used Yahoo to download music and i never had any problems, until about two weeks ago. Everytime I plug it in to the computer, it freezes up. Now I can't download any music to it... very frustrating! I've tried looking online for help but nothing has worked, next step will be to call customer service.It's really nice that it has radio built in, that it records voice and radio, and that it plays video. I have no complaints while it was working- If I was to do it again I'd try a different brand- after reading these reviews I'm not so sure about Samsung's reliability. Personally, I still wouldn't get an Ipod- I think they are a rip off, and it's ridiculous they only use Itunes."
2,Warranty? What Warranty?,"After using the YP-T9 for about 7 months, the battary would no longer accept a charge. Called Samsung for help and they asked for the serial #. Unfortunately the # is on a small label on the back of the unit, where it will easily wear off! No #, no warranty! They told me I could send it in and pay about $120 + shipping out of my own pocket to fix the problem. Gee, the unit itself only cost about $100. I also have one of their 50"" widescreen DLP TVs and when I had a problem with hooking it up to my DVR using a HDMI cable, they immediatly blamed the problem on the DVR and told me to just use one of the other types of input cable. The HDMI input capability was one of the reasons I bought this unit! THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO WANT TO STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS AND HONOR THEIR WARRANTIES!!!"
5,Refurbed but perfect.,"Works exactly how it is supposed to. Good battery time. The option to slow down music can be hilarious. I didnt need tens and tens of gigs of memory, just enough for fun and working out. The buttons do take a little time to get used to."
4,I like it!,"Overall, I like this little MP3 player.First, the bad. I don't particularly like the software that comes with it, so I use Rhapsody to do everything I need to. I also don't like that I can't set the volume to always turn on at a certain level, so if I turn the player off, when I turn it back on it goes back to whatever the default is.The good is that I love the size of the player, it's easy to navigate through the different menus, and there's enough memory so that I've never even managed to get the thing even halfway full of music. It has video features I never use, but I've run the video that it comes with and the picture is very clear."
4,Great MP3 player,Compact with great graphics and sound. Size is perfect for working out or running and plenty of memory for a wide variety of music.The proprietory software leaves a lot to be desired and Samsung doesn't have a USA available online store like Apple to purchase music.
2,If it only worked...,It's the second one I bought today....the first one froze when I was trying to do my first donwload...went back to Circuit City and got another one...the second one was even worse...never turned on! Tomorrow I'll go back to get an IPOD!
2,Very Nice,"I got this after owning an iPod mini for a couple years. Despite all the iPod hype, I think the Samsung YP-T9 is actually easier to use and more intuitive.In an earlier version of this review, I had some scathing remarks for the Samsung software. Well guess what, the software did the ""call home"" thing today, updated itself, and fixed several of my problems. Wow, for a product that was released so recently, I'm impressed that they came out with an update so quickly.Like another reviewer here, I got really burned out with the iTunes/shareware hassle on my iPod. If you find yourself in the same boat, try the Samsung."
1,Not worth the money,"I read the other reviews before buying this and I'm not sure if this item has changed since then or what but I don't see this item being worth $30 at all. I uploaded a picture of whats in the box. I'd estimate there's about $10 worth of loose candy tops. All the candy inside is readily available at any local candy store or grocery store. I was expecting to see candy that I haven't seen in a while but maybe 90's candy is still very popular. There was one little pack of Now and Laters in the box and if your a candy person you know those are a pretty good indicator on freshness depending how soft or hard they are, they were fresh so that's good. All and All if you are looking to put something like this together I'd go to your local store to buy, you will get 3X as much for the same price."
5,great read,"This book is full of wonderful plays by Bertolt Brecht. I had performed a scene from The Judge in one of my acting classes in community college, and I just HAD to get my hands on my own copy after. I'm glad I got it, because I love reading all of his plays."
1,Can't mix a good beat,"Can't sleep on the streets, eh? Well this 'artist' better get used to it, cause this 'album' blows chow."
2,"Akward setup, poor range","I was hoping to be able to get this item insteadl of one of the $100 xbox wireless bridges, however, this item doesn't compete at all with the range of the xbox adapter. I did notice that there are booster antenas to replace the one which comes in the box, and supposedly that will give this set a better range. However, then the cost is up to the one of the xbox anyway.Also, this piece did not configure easily at all. It wouldn't work when connected to the xbox, but I had to go and install it on my PC (that means if you don't have a PC, it could be useless) then connect it to the xbox to get it to work."
3,Terrible setup,"If you use WEP encryption, this device can be a real pain to configure. You have to plug it into your PC or your router to get all of the options you need to configure it."
3,You get what you pay for,"I had this blender for about three years now. Right out of the box, the pulse function never worked. Also, I was never able to crush ice with it. Anything that's somewhat frozen, like frozen fruit, forget it. It will not work. This machine works fine for liquids or soft items. I bought it because it was cheap and I liked the plastic jar. Clean up is easy, too. I am currently shopping around for a new blender. I will spend a little more money this time, and (hopefully) get a better quality."
1,Worked for a while,"I paid more for this product because I thought it was of higher quality...I was wrong. We used our bender maybe once or twice a week and have had it about a year before the ""grinding"" started. For some reason the blade will not seat down on the shaft of the motor cleanly. I have to push down to try to get it engaged. I'm reluctant to spend more money for parts on it because it should've lasted longer than this to begin with. Not reccommended."
2,Not the best for food...,"May be I taxed it a little too much by trying to grind lentils, rice and coconut once in a while...it stopped working a month after I bought it when I was trying to grind some coconut...It was great for softer stuff like tomatoes or making juices and shakes...I am planning to get myself a food processor and would suggest the same to all with similar intensions."
2,A mediocre choice,"This blender, with the 10 speeds and low price (not to mention the quality reputation previously associated with Oster), lured me in. I've had mine for almost two years, and am still frustrated with its lack of mixing power. I make smoothies in mine and have to carefully stick a spoon in while it's mixing in order to get the top layer to mix with the bottom layer. Also, despite its high promises, it isn't worth a darn when you try to crush ice. I'm getting married in a few months and have added a different blender to our registry. Spend your money on better quality."
1,Avoid this piece of junk.,"After 2 weeks of minimal use, this piece of garbage literally broke apart at it's base. One would think with the name of Oster you would get something that lasts longer than Madonna's current affected accent, but this was not the case. Avoid my friends, avoid!"
1,Useless blender,"This blender only mixes the bottom two inches near the blade unless you're blending pure liquid. Therefore, it is useless for smoothies. Besides this, the bottom leaks. Overall, a very bad choice. I'm shopping for a different blender."
1,Used to swear by Oster,"I have to echo what ""A Kitchen & Housewares enthusiast"" said. I had the same issues. This has got to be one of the worst blenders that Oster has ever made. My last Oster lasted 15 years, this one lasted 5 months."
1,Terrible Product.,"We registered and received this blender for a wedding gift. We didn't use it for about 5 months, then I made one protein shake. It began to vibrate excessively, the base got hot and it smelled as if it was burning. It stalls and does not differeniate between settings. Clearly, this problem is similiar to others which indicates a Oster manufacturing problem not simply an isolated incident. I will certainly exchange this blender for a different brand."
1,Piece of junk,This blender is a real piece of junk. Bust after 6 months. Replaced the internal fuse. Blew it again. And again. Not worth the effort. Don't get this blender.
4,GREAT PRODUCT!!,great product great sound not perfectly clear but a lot better that ANY fm transmitter.works very good with my iphone the only bad thing is a stattic noise once a while when I connect my iPhone to it but all you have to do is set it up to airplane mode. Also works great with iPod nano.
5,Outstanding,Product is exactly what I needed. Crystal clear sound and easy installation. I had messed with a FM transmitter but realized any driving distance out of my area requred me to constantly change radio stations. I have uninterupted enjoyable music now at 1/3 of the cost of a transmitter. Absolutly recommended for anyone wanting to use an ipod or similar MP3 player though their car radio.
4,Better than wireless options in the Twin cities,"This sounds better than any wireless FM transmitter I have tried. There really isn't any noise and the signal is clean, just a little soft. I have to have my deck turned up most the way and the input up most the way to have a good listening level. Installation was pretty typical."
4,"Works, suits it's purpose.","No frills. You get what you pay for. But it worked out of the box just fine. Sound quality is definitely acceptable. No noticeable defects. Used it to complete a Sirius install in a Ford Explorer, worked fine."
4,Good for those of us stuck with no auxilary inputs,"I bought this so that I could use my new iPod nano with my stock '02 Ford Focus radio. I didn't want one of those silly looking aftermarket radios in my dashboard, so this was the only decent option for me.The sound quality is surprisingly good. Installation was quick and easy.I've found that it's best to turn down the volume on your device and turn it up on your radio or else it will sound a bit distorted."
4,Very pleased with this product,"The product is relatively simple to install. This difficultly level is probably more due to the type of car than the product. It was simple to put in a Toyota Camry. The sound quality is very good. It comes through like a clear FM channel. Obviously going through antenna this is the best it could possibly be.There are no instructions included, but installation is pretty obvious if you have ever installed a car stereo head unit. Also, I'm sure from just reading this comment section, you can pretty much figure out how to install the device."
3,"great product, with some drawbacks","i am very satisfied with the sound, most of the time, but sometimes there is still static. i was under the impression from the description that when it was switched on, the antenna input was turned off, so that there would be no static, but i still get some. also, it only came with spanish instructions in the box. this was ok because i didnt need them anyway, but it might be a problem for some people. also, the switch only came connected to two wires, but to get the light inside it to work, you need to attach another wire and ground it, and switch two of the wires. the light can also become hot after being on for a long time, so it might be good to leave it disconnected. i got a cable with it to connect to dock port for improved audio quality and so that it charges, and it works great with that.[...]"
3,"Good, but not great","I bought this modulator to hook up my ham radio to my stock car audio unit. Hoping to use for MP3 player input as well.Pros: a) It's cheap. b) It's easy to install.Cons: a) Volume is too low, even when various sources' volumes are maxed b) My opinion is that there is too much audible white noise at low volumes, especially considering con ""a"".Ultimately it's fine for the crappy sound of ham radio, but I'm not too thrilled with how my MP3 player sounds, along with other audio sources I've tried."
1,NOT ENOUGH INFO,"The instructions sheet comes in 3 different languages - neither of which is English! There's a diagram for you to follow on the back of the package. If you have a car antenna jack which is ""hardwired into the back of your factory radio (as was mine) then you have to ""cut & splice"" to connect (which I did). There's also a ""button switch"" for on/off which you can either just leave ""hanging"" somewhere, or you can drill a hole into your dash somewhere and install it (which I had NOT done...yet). After all of that, it would NOT work! Trouble shot it 5 times, or was it 6, 8..10x. Radio worked fine, but switch would NOT!I guess if it worked, it would have been worth all of the effort. I sent it back for a refund."
2,Not as good as I had hoped,"Let me begin by stating that I have not installed the modulator at this time. However, I have taken it out of the package, hooked the various parts together and looked at how I am going to mount it. As far as mechanics and parts it appears fine. The problem that I have is with the mounting setup for the Aux port. Instead of a typical configuration where you would drill a hole in the dash to pass the wires through and then tighten a nut down on the outside that holds on a cover and conceals the hole, all this unit has is a piece of double-stick tape on one side of the aux port input. It's not even on both sides or loose so you can select which side to mount it by. It is pre-mounted on the left side so your mounting options are limited. This makes it look cheap and will be nearly impossible to not have wires showing. It may seem minor but it is frustrating to those of us trying to have a ""finished"" look and really brings down my overall satisfaction."
2,Needs Instructions in English,"I rely on installation instructions in English, not Spanish. Why should I get a translator for a product sold in my country... I am still trying to figure out the diagram so I don't know if the modulator even works."
1,Be careful with these folks,"I purchased this FM modulator for my Chevy Tahoe. It did not have compatible antenna plugs, so I asked to return it. The vendor, ANTOnline, said I could return it but their return policy would apply. I was afraid that meant that even though they advertised this thing as universal fit, but it wouldn't fit the Tahoe, that they would not return the $7 shipping and there would be a restocking charge. Twice I sent emails asking for that clarification but received no response. From now on I will be certain to first, determine who Amazon is shoving me off to when making a purchase, and second, call those vendors if they have a phone to ask if their product is as advertised and what they do if it doesn't work as advertised. I will no longer do business with vendors with no phones. Purchasing on the internet is getting more and more risky and challenging each day."
2,FM Modulation is more hassle than it's worth.,"I got the product and then realized that I needed another adapter to work with my car. It was just as easy to send this back as order the other, equally expensive part. I concluded that FM modulation, wired or wireless, was not work the hassle. Fortunately, all three family cars have a cassette player, so I use a $12 cassette adapter, which has marginal sound quality, but is easy to use and highly reliable."
5,Good!,"Great product. Sure I'd like a new amp in the car etc etc, but for a cheap solution to now be able to play my iphone 3g, this rocks. Team it with a vent clip and run the wire out of the vent, and you've got a pretty clean install."
3,Purity,"This book was a very odd read. Homosexual erotica, obsessive behaviors, mental illness all wrapped up in a love triangle."
4,Chilton's repair manual,Product was exactly as described. I received within allotted time promised. No surprises. I would order from this shipper again.
5,Great for Rythm Tapping,"I was trained in traditional and flash tap dancing, so I knew very little about rhythm tap. This book goes over the basics of tap and many traditional tap steps. What makes it so great, though, are the in-depth explanations of rhythm, dynamics, syncopation, accents, and new forms of tap, including rhythm tap and orchestrated tap. The explanations are clear and easy and the practice exercises are excellent. This is a must-have book for anyone wishing to expand their tap knowledge and artistry."
5,Wonderful Experience,"Book was in perfect condition and very much brand new even though it was advertised as used! Seller was extra honest in description- book was in perfect condition but had a non noticeable line from shipping (I'v even seen this on books in Barnes and Nobles bookstores) - still the seller advertised as scratched cover... I have never experienced this level of honesty from an Amazon seller before.It took some time to ship which was frustrating, but I am too happy with the quality to care about that.http://www.amazon.com/gp/r.html?R=2B0697SGPAYEK&C;=2E8LXWJ5PCETG&H;=1YNCOTXKMHZZLDLUTK9SHAWKWM4A&T;=C&U;=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Freview%2Fcreate-review%2Fref%3Dpe_6680_14093160_cm_cr_ec_add_1_h_c14093160%3Fie%3DUTF8%26nodeID%3D%26asin%3D0534514138%26customerID%3DA1EJH90YC3EPAD"
1,Never received the product and they never responded to my e-mail!!!,I ordered this book on May 7th for a class that started on May 30th. I estimated arrival date was from May 12th through June 2nd. I have never had a problem with Amazon books before this one. I never received the book and had to go to class empty handed. I will never use this provider again! I even e-mailed them on June 3rd and they never responded. I am going to request a full refund and go somewhere else.
5,"The Skills of Helping Individuals, Families, Groups, and Communities (with 2 CD Set) (Purchased on 09/11/2008)","This book is in excellent condition, practically new. In that transaction I had a big saving. The vendor did a good job, fast, and kept channels of communication open."
4,Gift For Hubby,This was a gift for my hubby and he loves it. We had ti mated and framed and it now hangs on our wall.
3,Not Bad,There were a few songs that I really liked. Most of them were not so good. I really thought the songs were going to be much better. I still like the group because they are one of my favorite.
1,Ripoff!!,How could they have Lion King 2 but not Lion King??? Who came up with this? And Hercules? Puhleez I dont call that a classic. Pocahontas should be in there in stead. Dont waste your money.

3,"A Comment about the reviewer ""A Viewer""","The older titles are not in widescreen because in the days when they came out in theatres, the theatre screens were not widescreen. So it is observing their original aspect ratio. Maybe you should do some research before you review something.I do however not understand why Lion King II made it on this set...I hate the disney sequels."
2,Disney Lovers Only,"Overall I think Disney has done a poor job of migrating to the next level of video technology. I purchased this set as a gift for my sister who is a Disney fanatic, and she enjoys it very much; however lack of DVD features makes this a less than desirable purchase for anyone who is not a 100% Disney lover. Save your money for other DVDs and just buy the Disney movies you can't live without."
4,Don't Pay the advertised price for these Disney films!,"I was excited when I heard that Disney was releasing some classic films on DVD. But when I received Pinocchio in the mail, and noticed really no extra features (just no ten minutes of commercials for other Disney products like on the videos), I was a little disappointed. I was glad I ordered my DVD online. Don't pay the advertised price for these films. Buy them online. As for this ""collection"", make your own. You can save by not buying that ""straight to video"" one. Always check the price on collections, often you can make your own ""best"" collection for less and not have any ""filler"" films."
1,Disney DVD comes up short,"I just want to re-iterate what many of the reviewers have already posted.I was excited when I heard that the classic Disney animated features were going to be on DVD. However, I was just as disappointed when they were finally released.The prices Disney is charging for these DVDs, compared to the features being offered is nothing short of ridiculous. Extra features and trailers aside, Disney could have at least remastered the older movies in Dolby 5.1. I believe 101 Dalmations and Pinocchio are not even being offered in widescreen. It is also not clear whether the films that are widescreen are enhanced for widescreen TVs.These are basic features I believe many DVD enthusiasts require before even considering whether or not to buy a movie on DVD. I hope the market bears this out and either forces Disney to lower the prices of these editions, or to start producing more feature-rich DVDs."
1,Thanks for the warning about no extras!,"I would LOVE to have all the Disney stuff on DVD, BUT I want all the goodies that I have come to appreciate in other DVD releases. The studios only listen to your wallet. I agree that if we want the goodies, then we can NOT buy anything that does not have them, otherwise we will never get what we really want. It will be frustrating to wait, but in the end it's the only thing that will get Disney, and the other studios still being lazy and cheap with their DVD releases, to pay attention. Besides, I have already been burned too many times with CDs as well as DVDs by hurrying to buy a new release, only to have the 'Special Edition' released a year later with all the goodies.Let your money do the talking!"
2,I've got to chop up the covers to get my 2 free...,"I bought this collection knowing that I would get two additional ""free"" Disney DVD's. Well, now that I have the DVD's, I find out that I have to cut the proof of purchase FROM THE COVER to get these freebies! Sure it's the back cover, but what kind of collectible has pieces scissored out of it? Disney KNEW that FEW collectors would redeem this. What a crock!"
3,You have no choice,"Since this is the only way disney will ever package these films for quite some time, If you want them now, you have no choice but to buy them. Some people complain that some are not in WIDESCREEN. These people do not realize that some of them were NOT MADE IN WIDSCREEN. Lady and the tramp was Disney's first film to be shot in the widscreen process so anything made before that, Pinocchio, Peter Pan, 101 dalmations, etc; are already in their original format. They will NEVER be in widscreen because they dont exist in that form. As for remastering the sound in 5.1, why bother? Lady and the tramp is presented in its original 5 channel surround mix, and any artificial mix made for these films would be sacreligious. I prefer to see them the way they were meant to be seen. Still, they are overpriced."
3,I have mixed feelings about this collection.,"O.K., having The Little Mermaid, The Jungle Book, Pinocchio, Mulan, Lady & the Tramp, 101 Dalmetians and Peter Pan is Great. But do you think Hercules and The Lion King 2 match these classics? I don't think so! Moreover, the lack of extra features should not be a Disney standard. After all, everybody was waiting for these animated pictures in dvd format. That said, the picture quality of the discs is very good and the sound corresponds to the period in which the movies were done. Now we are all waiting for colection #2 which should include Toy story, A Bug's Life, Beauty and the Beast, Tarzan, Pocahontas, Snow White, Cinderella & Sleeping Beauty !"
2,"Very bad idea, except one major correction to others reviews","This is a terrible collection, no extras, far too expensive..they must think we are really stupid to buy this set.That having been said one point needs to be made, the older Disneys films were not originaly filmed in what we call ""Widescreen"" on DVDs. Snow White, Pinnochio, and I think one or two others were filmed in what we call Pan and Scan. These film are not cut they never were filmed in the wider format, just look at the Wizard of OZ it isn't widescreen either.People need to realize that widescreen films were not possible until about the 1940's or 50's and even then it was soo expensive not all films were made in that format."
3,Special features needed,"I agree with the previous reviewer. Where are the special features on these DVDs? My kids really don't care about DVD's superior picture and sound quality vis-a-vis VHS. So why should I pay more money for the DVD version of these titles if they completely lack special features? (And, no, scene selection is not a special feature.)Special features like making-of documentaries and commentary tracks enhance your enjoyment of a movie and help justify the steeper cost of DVD. The Prince of Egypt (Dream Works) is a great example of an animated movie with nice extras. What's more, I don't see anything indicating that these are anamorphic (16 X 9 enhanced) video transfers. These would be wonderful movies to own, but until Disney learns how make DVDs properly, I'll save my money."
4,"Simba's Pride included in ""classic"" collection?","What in the world are they thinking when they included Simba's Pride in the ""classic"" collection? Why not include the real classics such as Lion King or Beauty and Beast or Sleeping Beauty.Great to have the real classics on DVD, though. However, since there are no special features and other extras with this collector's set, if you have the laser disc versions, I would not waste money on them. There is not much improvement in quality over your laser disc (and some of the CAV laser disc versions have special features). But if you were not one of the lucky ones to pick up the laser disc versions, go ahead and upgrade your tapes."
1,Ridiculous,"Disney = LoveIt is wonderful that they are putting their movies on DVDs now, but really people, don't spend this kind of money on a box set. The most you should be spending on a DVD is about $10, or $20 if you want it right away. I have been buying movies for a while, and the most I tend to spend is $5 on one. This box set has.. what? 9 movies in it? That should be a maximum of $90 in my opinion, and it should be even less since they are boxed together. Save your money. Wait a while and buy them separately."
2,Lion King 2?,"7 Classic Disney films, and then, The Lion King II. For the price, you would think you'd at least get the original on all 8. Maybe the rights have been sold to the musical theater show, I don't know."
2,Classics?,"Maybe its just me, but when I think classic Disney, Mulan, Hercules and the Lion King 2 are not what come to mind. Why the second Lion King instead of the first? I would think a classic collector's set would include some of Disney's most cherished works: Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Beauty and the Beast to name a few. I also agree with what many reviewers have already stated, the price is ridiculous especially when some of my favorite classics are not even included."
5,This is a Treasure,"The Disney Animation is so beautiful on DVD. The Pinnochio animation looks three dimensional. We bought these for our daughter, but my wife and I sit and watch them by ourselves. Highly recommended for the kid in all of us!"
5,What more can anyone want?,"I know that some people would expect special features galore on these DVDs, but aren't the movies what really counts? And for the movies, I'm very grateful that they are on DVD at last. The picture and sound quality are excellent and I really don't need anything more. These are some of the best animated movies in history and the only better way to own them is to have your own cinema theather and 35mm prints - next to impossible for mayority of us. So, buy them and enjoy them while you can!"
2,Typical Disney. Getting The Minimum For The Maximum Price,"Well, the good news is the Little Mermaid, Peter Pan, 101 Dalmations, Pinocchio, and Lady And The Tramp all shine on DVD. The bad news is that Mulan, Hercules, and the direct to video Lion King II: Simba's Pride still stink. Was Hades, the medocre villian in Hercules, involved in the desicion to release such an unever boxed set? The other bad news is all these movies, both as a boxed set and individually, cost top dollar for a DVD and come with the mimimum of extra features. You are lucky if you get a theatrical trailer. For the price Disney is charging they could have easily packed the extras that graced the deluxed editions of the laser discs of these films. If you must own these titles, by them individually, sparing some of the lesser titles. The only reason you may want to own all these movies is if you have a child who loves all of them."
4,Finally! It's about time...,"The quality of animation was superb. As if it came out only yesterday. Check out Pinocchio. Minor problem with Little Mermaid, a short unusual pause/cut around the scene where Ariel gets her legs on shore. Perhaps the disc is bad?I wish Disney came out with extra features. Disney take a look at Prince of Eygpt, I hope you guys do a better job on the other classics and your recently acquired Miyazaki Anime."
4,Anthology? Nothing now,"I was surprised to read that many of the DVDs in this collection are no even in widescreen. They dared to charge this much for a collection and put in the cheaper versions as well. Watching movies in their original widescreen version is one of the major reasons why DVD format is awesome. It is a real dissapointment that they couldn't ""spring"" for the widescreen that usually runs [a little] more, boo hoo. I would NOT recommend this set, it is WAY over prices, and you will miss half of some of these movies seeing them in ""pan & scan"". And don't get me started on why ""The Lion King"" was not included but ""The Lion King 2"" was!!!!!"
4,"Not My First Choice of Movies, But Still Worth It","When I first thought above rating this box set, I thought that I would give it a 3 out of five, but then I went and retrieved the set from the video shelf. The more I closely examined it, the more that I realized that most of the movies included in the set are great films. Not only for children but for adults as well. I find myself choosing the film for the evening and not my son. I guess age has its privileges. Mulan has to be my favorite followed by The Little Mermaid. Probably wouldn't have purchased Hercules if it wasn't included in the set, but it is still a good film.Then I thought to myself, would I purchase this box set again. The answer is simply, ""YES!""My only true disappointment is that Disney has not released a second box set yet."
1,NINE WRONG ITEMS,"I ordered the walt disney animated anthology the classic collector's set which was suppose to come with, the little mermaid, hercules, mulan, pinocchio, the jungle book, peter pan, lady and the tramp, the lion king II:simba's pride and one hundred and one dalmations instead we were sent cars, pirates of the caribbean the curse of the black pearl and dead man's chest, the sword in the stone, the rescuers, bedknobs and broomsticks, herbie fully loaded, miracles,and the shaggy dog....very disappointing for the kids christmas morning!"
1,I'm boycotting Disney until they release Toy Story,"I'm also extremely annoyed that Disney/Pixar released A Bug's Life knowing full well everyone would buy it, and then they came out with the Collector's Edition of A Bug's Life a year later at a ridiculously high price. How family-unfriendly can a bunch of marketers get!"
2,single your dvd's,THE movies even though they are some of disneys best animated films there were just to many there maybe customers who my one two or three but possible not all.THEREFORE it is my belief to offer them single at a time and collector's set you are offering this way may make a choice much easier and do you more sells.
1,hehe .. ooooh,"Pinocchio - 24.50101 Dalmatians - 19.99Mulan - 22.49Hercules - 22.49Peter Pan - 29.99Lion King .. not LKII 22.49Lady and the Tramp 24.00Jungle Book - 22.99Little Mermaid - 18.99Grand Total: - 207.93All of them are special editions and I've not the listed reduced private seller price, thats the straight up corporate sham price. I regularly shop for awards/trophys and I couldn't imagine a pretty case with plate gold finish costing more than 80 bucks thats 287.93 You could still take your sweetheart to the movies and Benigans for some baked potato soup for this inflated price. I'm not sure .. But I don't THINK this case is platinum, makes you look any younger, make you fly or will help you sleep better so .. I think I've made my point."
2,Dinsey needed a Cash cow.,"So many people have been screaming for Disney to go DVD and they did. People rejoiced, but sadly the result is no good. These DVDs are overpriced and Not that great.Disney should have taken a look at the a Bug's Life 2 Disc set for Content and Prince of Egypt Disc for presentation. Okay sure these discs are all Full Frame but Hey Mulan would have been cool in Anamorphic!Disney has proven their intentions buy releasing substandard DVDs just to make some extra dough. A mere upgrade from their VHS versions.Buy this only if you want don't own the vhs tapes.OH What's up with the Lion King II? When did Direct-to-Video titles become Classics?"
1,This DVD set is a LOSER!!,"I am huge fan of Disney movies and when I think of the DVD collection encasing ""The Classics,"" the last title I would put on my list would be ""Lion King 2-Simbas Pride!"" That ""cartoon"" is not a classic by any means. Although Mulan and Hercules are good Disney movies they hardly hold a candle to ""Lady and the Tramp,"" ""101 Dalmations"" or ""The Jungle Book."" Disney really screwed up on this one! Can you see yourself paying for a $30.00 DVD with no extras, no commentary, no deleted scenes etc..??? Heavens NO! Consumers are getting smarter about what is considered quality and what goes straight to the junk pile. This DVD set priced as is, sells each DVD for approximately $33.90 per DVD! THAT'S RIDICULOUS!! Save your money folks! Keep your VHS tapes, they still have several years of enjoyment."
2,"Some Good, Some Bad","Ok, ok...I have got to say that the biggest thing that dissappoints me about this set is the lack of some real true classics. As many have said, The Lion King, one of the best...Aladin, who can forget that...and if Disney would get off of it's back side and see the truth, they would release Song of the South on DVD and add it......I do love Lady & the Tramp, Jungle Book, Little Mermaid, and (although newer than the rest) Mulan....But Lion King 2 stunk bigtime, huge let-down...Hercules, BLAH BLAH BLAH...101 Dalmations, Pinochio, and Peter Pan are definately the classics that have earned their right to be in there. One last thing....with DVD's today typically going for about 20 to 25 bucks....why in the world are these averaging [price] a pop, and they don't even come with special behind the scenes, deleted scenes, special add on stuff that make DVD so awsome.............."
3,Where's Aladdin and The Lion King??,"This boxed-set features many classic disney films, such as: One Hundred and One Dalmatians, Pinocchio, Peter Pan, The Little Mermaid, Lady and the Tramp and The Jungle Book! The rest of them arn't classics, atleast not yet. The Lion King II was very dissapointing, in my opinion!However, even though the the box-set is superb, it still lacks something, and that something is The Lion King and Aladdin! I consider those two to be the best of the bunch! Disney should have included them. I would have given this box-set 5 stars if it wasn't for the absense of The Lion King and Aladdin.Dont get this boxed-set! Disney WILL release another one...I know they will!"
2,Marketing Ripoff...,"When did Lion King II become a Classic? The origional Lion King WAS a Classic (however it is not in the set). I think the Marketing people can line up the Classics in a much better package. The 2 stars go for the DVD format...can't beat it. As others have mentioned, Disney plays around with release dates....bad decision."
1,Disney can do better.,"It would be the easiest thing in the world for Disney to compile some line test footage, interviews with the animators, different script drafts, Frank and Ollie's audio commentary, or character design sketches into these DVD's, but instead they release them bare bones! The Ghostbuster DVD is PACKED with goodies, is Disney less creative?Are they planning to never release them with any features, or are they hoping true Disney fans will have to buy them AGAIN when they re-release them as anniversary editions?Save your money, fans. Watch your videos."
4,Widescreen,"I wanted to clarify something I know about Disney widescreen. Some of these features are not being offered in widescreen (ex. Pinocchio) because they were not even originally filmed in widescreen. The first Disney film to use widescreen was Sleeping Beauty, which came out in 1959. Pinocchio came out in 1940."
5,A real steal,"... For that price you get several great movies. When we first bought the set, our son was not old enough to enjoy many of the movies. However, when we went on the Disney Cruise he discovered Hercules and he was so excited to see that he had it when we got home. And Mulan is also a great movie - our son loves Mushu. ..."
4,"Great set, Horrible price",This is a terrific set of classics. It is an essential start for Disney on DVD and you can pick up releases not currently available any other way. Still too pricey though as this deal can be found for half this amount.
2,Clasic Lite,"What is Disney Buena Vista thinking, calling this so-so collection, ""The Classic"" Collectors set ?WHERE is ""SLEEPING Beauty ?"" It seems you if you live in Germany you can purchase the DVD ""Sleeping Beauty"" on German: Amazon.de"
3,I agree with the previous 'Vintage Taylor' reviewer. LONG!,"I too wish this author had glossed over some sections. They weren't boring, but would have rather read less of the war plans & dialoge and more of the main relationship instead. This is my 1st Janelle Taylor book, but it won't be my last. I just agree that is just how the Vintage Taylor wrote her review, it could have easily been my words -exactly.If you aren't into Cival war romances, I'd pass on this one, but I was so drawn in, I had to finish it. The love scenes still linger on my thoughts when I think of good romances. My only complaint is the story seemed toward completion, then a second plot was added that made it drag on too long. 3 1/2 stars."
4,Import!,I had no idea this was an import album! I asked for it for Christmas a few years back and have listened to it ever since. Generaly it's great. It's one of those CDs you can just let play. some of the songs are bland but over all it's great. I'd say it's worth the import price but only if your really into this kind of music.
1,Mine lasted two years,"I thought it was a bargain - nope! I like products that last. This one didn't. The toast/broil/bake knob broke and now it only bakes and doesn't do that especially well.If you're in a money pinch, buy a ten dollar toaster but save your money and shop around for a quality product. This isn't it."
2,Works well when working,The timer is great but the oven only worked for 1 year. The oven uses a heat lamp and the lamp burned out. It can't be replaced so now its junk. Spend the extra 10 bucks and get a black and decker. They use metal rods for heating and last a lot longer.
1,"This Toaster is DANGEROUS, should be RECALLED","When our Black and Decker finally died, we purchased the TTOB4 because it was so inexpensive. A few weeks after we used the TTOB4, we found that several power cords from other appliances had melted against the back of the toast oven. This left bare metal exposed and could lead to an electrocution or fire! Do not allow anything behind this oven! Now I have to fix three power cords. In my opinion, Toastmaster should recall this product immediately.Otherwise, the biggest problem we have is that the timer must be set every time you use the toaster. Since the timer scale resolution is too small, you can never get consistent toasting results. It also seems slower at toasting than the B&D."
2,Too slow for toast,"I bought this one because it was [inexpensive] It worked okay but was extremely slow heating up. Toast took more than 4 minutes on a light setting. Also, I would not cook anything thicker than a slice of bread, as the heating element burned the higher surface of what I was cooking before cooking the item completely."
3,Decent,"If you are just starting out in life and are on a limited budget, this toaster oven will get your through. It can do the small jobs, like toasting a sub sandwich and such.However, it probably won't last more than a few years. I don't have many complains with mine. The size is great and the price was right at the time. If it survives all the way through college, I will use thing thing until it dies.All in all, if you're just starting out, this would be a good buy. But if you have the money, pay a little more for a better one."
4,Pretty Dang Good,"I am really stating this from my teachers point of view. She had been a teacher for 30 something years and she said this was one of the better books that she had used. As a student, it was pretty good to me, and I made an A in the class, but it probably means more to say that the teacher really liked the book. It seemed to work for me. Of course, this isn't one of those books that you just go out and buy (most people). It was my Organic Chem I & II book in undergrad, but like I've said 6 times already, it was ""Pretty Dang Good"""
5,Organic concepts!,I think this book makes organic chemistry as interesting as it can get ... in fact this book made me love organic chemistry in high school and I refer back to it ever since ... it is not really written in the style of a textbook but serves as an excellent reference book to grasp the intricacies underlying the toughest organic chemistry reactions ...
5,Great casserole!,I love this bowl. It's a nice size for casseroles and the lid snaps on for storage. I use it for marinating meats and chicken and for large salads. It's great in the microwave; The vents really work. I even make Jello deserts in it. Very easy to clean and easy to store. Pyrex put a lot of thought into the style. It really works well for me.
2,What? I'm confused!,"Either it didn't work for me, I'm stupid, or it's a piece of [junk]. Because when I asked it questions, I got stupid answers that no one would understand!"
4,Daughters best friend,"I bought a Mellow years ago for my daughter when she was just born. It is THE teddy, her ""blankie"" - old and black and gross. But she loves it. Thought another one - one with color still on it - would be appropriate!"
1,Don't bother with this one...,"I love reading good crime fiction: Lee Child, Janet Evanovich, Martha Grimes, Ian Rankin, Peter Lovesey, etc. This is not good crime fiction at all; the author gets completely bogged down in the rollercoaster feelings that the one dimensional characters have for each other and the book really flops as a result. It might be good romance reading but it's an awful crime novel."
3,the prey,i am sorry but i have just received this book so i can't review itas i haven't had a chance to read it yet i've come back to this review so i can finish it my computer crashed yesterday and i've just had someone in to fix it thankyou
4,Not Bad...,I really enjoyed this book. I though it was a good one for someone just coming out. I can't wait to see what else she has up her sleeve after this trilogy.
5,One of the better series on the subject,"It's great that they collected the first two voumes into this easy to find book. IV is fairly available online as well. When, oh when, are they going to re-release the impossible to find vol's 3 and 5, so people don't have to pay bogus collector's prices for them???"
1,Not Very Durable,This machine did not last very long(less than a year) and the loaves were not very good. I do not recommend purchasing this unit.
2,Product failure,I previously owned the same model of this Oster 5838 Breadmaker that lasted for several years. I am disappointed that this replacement only lasted 3 months before failure of the circuit board. The item looked brand new when I received it. I must conclude that the failure is an anomaly but feel that I would never purchase another one.
5,love the expressbake breadmaker,I have used the breadmaker several times already since receiving it. I have been very very happy with it in every way-it came with easy to follow directions-easy recipes to become familiar with it-it is very easy to clean after using-and a little toddler that often visits loves to peek into the window when he hears it kneading the bread-it is interesting to watch it go through the various cycles. I have used it once for pizza dough-will definetly do that again-it turned out well. The store that I purchased the breadmaker from was also very good-and very effecient-it came exactly as expected on the delivery date-was wrapped and handled well also. I am very happy that I bought it and with the outfit I purchased it from as well-would do it again and encourage anyone to go for it-it it well worth it.
2,Bread maker,"When received, unit did not work. Called the consumer support line and a new unit was shipped and no cost. The replacement unit is working great"
5,Oster bread maker,Ever since I went to my son's house and tasted home made bread from his machine I've been waiting for a good deal on one. This was the great deal. The first machine I got was defective. The second machine was wonderful!
3,Not pleased at all,"I finally got rid of my old Oster and replaced it with this one. I have made 4 loaves of bread, and 2 of them failed. I had 15 years experience with the old one, and had only 3 or 4 failures in all that time. Move on, and find a different machine. Oster really let me down with this one."
1,Do Not Buy,I received the Oster 5838 Breadmaker for a gift. It would not work. I returned it. Then I got another Oster 5838 Breadmaker in return. I have used it three times. Now it continues to register the error message E01. Now what? I would not recommend this breadmaker.
1,really disapointed-waste of money,"I bought this breadmaker off of amazon (great shipping,came in no time)-I bought the breadmaker in hopes i could save money by make bread instead of buying it at the store. I have baked 4 loves of bread and all have fallen during the bake cycle. Twice i have used boxed bread mixes. It's really disapointing-this is my first time baking bread and using a breadmaker. Also the loves come out hard on the sides and when i try to slice them they tear apart! This was a waste of money for me:("
1,I wish I could give it zero stars.,"I received this as a birthday present. I first tried making a loaf of honey wheat bread and followed the instructions from the manual. I was happy with how easy it was....I was unhappy with the results. Basically after the cycle was over, I was presented with a soggy brick of half dough/half undercooked bread. It was inedible and I basically wasted a bunch of ingredients. I thought maybe it was just a first time around mistake on my part and decided I'd give it another shot. I made the easiest possible recipe and once again I wasted 4 cups of flour plus all of the other ingredients on a soggy half baked lump of dough that had to go in the trash. I've never had a brand new machine just not work at all. It was really disappointing. If you're thinking of buying this bread maker I urge you not to."
2,What am I doing wrong?,I bought the Oster Bread maker to replace one that I had for 12 years. When I received this one it was obvious that the quality was poor compared to my old one. I have not had a respectable looking loaf of bread with this machine no matter where the recipe comes from. I was used to making any recipe in my old machine and the bread was always perfect. I will keep trying.
1,"Makes bricks, not bread","This is my third machine in ten years of bread making. Liked a number of the physical features of the machine, so I bought it. It never worked correctly. Cannot make a loaf of bread without the center falling in and the crust being very hard-----a virtual brick. The bake function over cooks every loaf type. Guess it could be returned for another, but it's not worth the risk. Also, I did learn that I value a two paddle machine more than I realized. Went back to my old machine and am enjoying homemade bread again."
1,Worst breadmaker I've ever had!,"My last bread machine was an Oster that cost half what this one did and worked twice as well--even after 8 years and a broken lid! The current model is worthless, except for making pizza dough. So far, I've tried ten bread recipes. Every one produced a too-hard crust, and flour caked at the bottom if I didn't use a spatula to help the early mixing. All but one produced a sunken top--and the one that didn't sink overflowed the pan."
1,"I agree with others, collapsed EVERY time",I have tried different recipes and fresh ingredients and I have yet to produce any loaf that hasn't fallen. I suspect it has something to do with the heating element since the loaf rises and looks great right up to the baking point. I have had different breadmakers in the past that have worked great. Not this one. I will be looking for a replacement.
1,Delay Timer Does Not Work for Dough,"We bought this as a replacement for our 5-year old Oster breadmaker. We loved that breadmaker, not because of the quality of the bread (which we never perfected) but because we could set it in the morning and come home to fresh dough ready for making pizza in the evening.This breadmaker no longer lets you use the timer for the dough/pasta setting. I called the company, and no Oster breadmakers have that feature any more.So, if you are like us, and want to come home from work with dough ready so you can make a quick dinner, buy another brand of breadmaker."
1,DISASTER!,"This was such a disappointment. The machine broke on our second attempt. We contacted Oster for a replacement bread pan. They charged us $20 for it, and the one they sent us does not fit into the bread machine! And the loaves that we managed to make fell. We will be staying away from Oster products in the future."
3,Lasted 2 years,"I gave this bread machine 3 stars because it made beautiful bread, but the bread pan did not hold up as long as the machine. The bread pan paddle fell out a few times and the pans screw came out and consequently made the machine worthless, considering a pan is 25.00+ and pan paddle is 5.00+. Might as well buy a new machine on sale, in which we did and feel our new machine will last much longer. You can tell the difference in machine durability by just picking it up. I am keeping the recipe book, though, as it has great bread recipes unlike my new machine."
4,Love it!!,"I got this breadmaker on a whim. I came to Amazon to read the reviews after I bought it and got a little worried because of all the negative ones. I've made a few loaves now and they've all turned out GREAT!! A lot of people have complained about bread not turning out correctly, but I think it's the person's doing, not the breadmaker (I've followed a few recipes I have found online and in the book it provides). Keep in mind, I've never made bread before and never even used a breadmaker, and this one seems to work great for me.The only issue I have with it is that the shape of the pan is a little awkward and makes the loaves tall. Also, sometimes after taking the loaf out of the pan the kneading device leaves a giant hole on the underside of the bread. These aren't TOO big of issues for me, though, because I am not making bread for looks.Like I mentioned, I don't have any other experience with breadmakers, but I do recommend this one if you're a newbie like me! :)"
2,bakes too hot,Every loaf we've made with this machine has come out over baked. It just seems to bake at too high a temp.
3,Oster Bread Maker Review,"Well, I am from Bombay India and probably the only member of my family that was as excited about getting a new bread maker at home for that Fresh smelling bread. I managed to get an Osterbreadmker last month. The only drawback I have is that here inBombay we dont get readymade flour for the bread. So I have toget the flour,salt,sugar,butter,yeast and mix them in the pan.I have tried baking a whole wheat bread 5 times. The 1st 3 times it was a total mess. The 4/5th time I got a very good looking bread which was perfect to eat while it was hot but became a rock hard WEAPON once it became cold the next morning.Could someone please tell me where am I going wrong with theWhole Wheat? I have followed exact instructions from the OSTERmanual.The white bread was a great success all times but I mixed and matched the ingredients as per my own intuition and DID NOTfollow the book.Regards,Lariv"
3,Oster Breadmaker issues,"Many of the reviews of the Oster mention problems getting the Oster breadmaker to make satisfactory loaves of bread. I've been using this model for several years. My initial efforts pretty well matched the experience relayed in other reviews. Bricks or collapsed loaves, etc.Here's the real scoop. This bread machine is very sensitive to the amount of moisture. Be prepared to experiment in order to make satisfactory loaves. Take notes when making bread in the machine. If it collapses or hits the lid, use less water. If it is a brick add more water. Try adding gluten if the loaf won't rise well. Add slightly more yeast if it is a brick.After much note taking and slight modifications to the recipes, I've managed to make excellent loaves of bread starting from nearly any recipe I've found on the internet. Some work well as written, but most won't work well in this machine without some adjustment. So be prepared to experiment.Experimentation is half the fun of baking anyway."
1,Terrible!!,"I only used the dough cycle, as I like to bake my own loaves in the oven. The Oster never gave me a good doughball. One problem I noticed was that the final product was drying on the outside. I just never produced a good loaf of bread with this thing (granted, there are dozens of variables to control, but I've been making bread for 15 years)."
2,baked poorly,"The oster 5838 breadmaker would do it's job mixing but when it came to baking it would rise and once it started to bake it would fall. Crust was way to dark on the light setting and hard. After using it 7-8 times the T on the bottom of the breadpan broke off. I was not impressed with the machine at all. I returned it for credit. I went back to my old West Bend until I decide to purchase a different machine. I have been bread baking for over 10 years so I knew what I was doing1!!Oster 5838 ExpressBake Breadmaker, White"
2,Rises great but collapses as bake cycle starts,"It was exciting to watch how beautifully this bread rose. But within a couple minutes after the bake cycle started, the middle would collapse. Customer Service suggested altering some ingredients slightly. Still collapsed once the heat came on. After 7 loaves like that, we sent it back depite the fact the bread was tasty, which is the only reason I gave it 2 stars. Obviously too much heat initially in bake cycle. Previous breadmaker made hundreds of loaves, but none like those! Very disappointing!"
2,the Oster 5838 bread maker,"I just purchased the Oster 5838 bread baker. When I gently raised the lid to remove the warm bread, the lid fell off onto the floor and was cracked. So much for bread making. I used the first bread recipe suggested in the manual and it was not good enough to give away or use with guests. It tasted just like regular purchased white bread except it was more dense than regular bread and had a very hard crust. I would think the manual-maker would suggest baking a more delicious bread for the first-time user to get the user excited and enthused about baking more bread. Having tasted the first bread, I am discouraged with the whole thing and plan to take it back for a refund. The lid must have been defective or it would not have fallen off the top of the machine so easily. So - I don't have to worry about gaining weight from all the delicious breads I could have baked IF the machine lid was stationery and the recipe was tasty."
4,Great Bread Machine,"We've bought two of this same model bread machine, one almost 4 years ago and the other 3 weeks ago. It's a very good machine. Our first one was used weekly for fresh bread for its entire life, I finally just wore it out. It produced a lot of great dough for other baking also. Very predictable, dependable...kinda' fun."
5,Works for me!,"Let me start by saying, I am no chef. I couldn't bake if my life depended on it. I got this machine with the hopes that, I too could bake fresh bread! And, guess what? I can! This machine gets the job done. I don't know about the other reviewers, but I suspect their issues aren't a result of the machine, but with their mixes / reciepes. If you follow the directions carefully, my rasin bread (and all others) have turned out just fine. Great, in fact!"
1,Oster Expressbake Bread Machine,"I've just learned that I have passed the point of being able to return this product for a full refund but felt I should review it negatively anyway for some satisfaction. I have tried numerous recipes,bought fresh flour and yeast, tried adjusting ingredients to get a good loaf but every loaf that I have baked in this machine has collapsed once it starts baking. I used a Breadman by Trillium for 20+ years before it finally quit producing good loaves but this machine hasn't produced a single good loaf. Very disappointed in the product. It received one star only because I had to rate it to submit the review."
2,Disappointing purchase,"I bought this bread machine as a gift for my daughter, assuming that since it's made by Oster it would be worth the purchase price...WRONG! Too bad she didn't want to hurt my feelings by telling me she couldn't make a decent loaf of bread in it soon enough for me to return it. I exchanged my beautiful Panasonic (that makes great bread) with her for this piece of junk! I can at least make an edible loaf of bread (by using recipes that came with my old Rival Kitchenpro--not the ones that came with this machine), but the bread is not the quality I got with either of my previous machines. Thumbs down on this product!"
2,Disappointed,"I have had this machine for just over 1 year. My wife and I make a loaf about every 5 to 7 days. This isn't our first machine.On this machine there are a series of problems. First it never made a long bake cycle loaf without the bread falling in the center.Second the bread was never light, it was a heavy bread. To moist. Only the express cycle/ quick bake cycle produced a full size loaf of bread.The main problem is the bearing in the motor. The bottom bearing is a metal sleeve made of cheap metal. The cheap metal will not take the stress and wears into a oblong shape causing the electric motor shaft to bind. The machine is very noisy and needed to set well back on the counter so it wouldn't ""walk"" off the counter.The baking tin is very thin and care must be taken not to dent or bend it on the bottom when shaking a loaf out of the pan."
5,Mmmmmmmmmm..........good!,"It makes pizza dough just like my nonna did back when I lived in Italia as a child. Not quite as good as hers but heh close enough! Also makes great breads and jams as well. I couldnt be more happy! Ay yai yai, Mamma mia!"
4,My 2nd Oster,"I bought a used one and liked it so much I gave it to a family member and bought this new one. I'm a little disappointed in this new one, it makes a noise like something is loose in it and the bread just doesn't seem to come out as good. I could have sent it back but chose to keep using it, thinking it just needs breaking in, hope I'm right!"
4,It's okay for the price,"I have been successful with the recipes from the rather meager cookbook that comes with it. So far, all other recipes I've made have flopped totally. I don't know if it's their recipes or if the machine has a different heat or something that varies quite a bit from other machines used on the other recipes. It is fairly easy to clean, not too noisy or shaky. The interior pan and paddle are okay, the pan is very probably not going to last an extended length of time. I wish they would explain what the different settings are based on, that might be helpful with some different recipes. Adequate for the price.Next time, I would probably consider one with the convection cooking option."
4,Works great,"After reading some bad reviews i was hesitant to purchase this machine, and wow was i pleasantly surprised,,, the machine is very easy to use and within a few hours i had a delicious loaf of bread ready to eat, very easy to use just put ingredients in pan place pan in machine and walla in time out comes a delicious hot bread,, the machine does everything, it mixes the dough , allows it to rise and then bakes the bread , like the manual saids just be sure to use exact measurements and so if u dont have the required measuring cups and spoons i suggest u purchase them."
1,Mother of all bread machine disasters..,"I am not a novice to bread machines. This is my 4th machine and was my Mother's Day Gift, per my request. I liked the look, the size and the horitzontal loaf style.In two days, I baked 5 loaves of bread, going thru 15 cups of King Arthur's flour. Every single one collapsed 8 minutes into bake cycle. I got fresh yeast, I got fresh flour and I was meticulous in my measuring. I tried Oster's recipe for white bread. After 4 failed attempts, I tried my own tried and true recipe that never fails. And that even collapsed. I am returning the machine."
4,Occational Gormet,"This is an alright machine. The only thing I don't like about it is that it automatically keeps the bread warm for an hour after it finishes cooking, which usually give you a brick. Also I have to store it in double plastic bags in order for it to turn out soft enough to eat. If you don't do this the crust will be rock hard, that's with the crust setting set at ""light"". Next you really have to baby sit it on its' initial kneeding. The last part of my review is that your price is WAY OUT OF LINE. I bought mine for around $35 at Target. You give $.49 off of list. I would say this is the worst price on any item I have seen on your site."
1,A total disappointment,"I had another Oster Breadbaker before this one, and I just loved it. I don't recall that I ever had a failure with it. After I started having trouble with the belt breaking in the old one, I decided to go with another Oster, and I have been totally disappointed with it. The flour doesn't mix in from the corners of the pans. The crust has been so hard you can break a tooth on it. And sometimes the bread rises and sometimes it doesn't. It seems to me that either the recipes are faulty--in which case the Oster test kitchens need to get back to work--or the machine is poorly designed. I sent an e-mail message to Sunbeam Customer Service about ten days ago, and even though they replied that I'd hear again from them within 48 hours, I haven't heard a peep. I cannot in good conscience recommend either this bread machine or the company that makes it."
2,Bread does not rise properly,I have tried several box mixes and they have all collapsed in the middle during the baking cycle. I then tried the same mixes on an older bread machine of my mother's to see if I was the problem and it baked them very nicely. I made several adjustments in the amount of water and yeast but still had the same problems. I have not tried baking from a recipe yet but will give that a shot before trying to return my machine.
2,"Eager, but disappointed","I loved the idea of having fresh bread every day, but so far every loaf I have tried has collapsed. I have tried different recipies and mixes, and they all have collapsed. Also the crust is REALLY crunchy on the sides, even on the lightest setting.Some friends have suggested letting the bread machine mix the bread, but baking it in the oven. What is the point of a breadmaker if it doesn't bake the bread?I play with it for a while longer, but think I will probably exchange it for another model.....if my husband kept the reciept!"
1,"Burns bread, even on the light setting.","After first buying a cheap Sunbeam that didn't work at all, I decided to upgrade to the Oster, which I soon discovered was also made by Sunbeam. After burning several loaves of whole wheat bread, I carefully check and timed the cycles (the cycle times are not in the manuel). I discovered that the only difference between white, whole wheat, etc. is the time it rises. All cooking cycles were 60 minutes. That is 20 minutes more than my old machine. Way too long for any type of bread that I know of."
5,Amazingly easy and versatile bread maker,I have never made bread before and I just made 2 loaves of bread with my new Oster. Both came out perfect. I made a cranberry bread on the normal 3 hr cycle and a cheddar bread on express in 58 mins following the recipe in the manual. If the bread doesn't turn out right it's the cook not the machine. You have to follow the easy instructions. I would highly recommend this machine.
1,A Terrible Breadmaker,"Although I have used several breadmachines over several decades, I made a HUGE mistake when I bought this Oster as a replacement. Whether the recipes were from the Oster book or from my file, the results was ""stonily"" equal: AWFUL!I strongly recommend not buying this machine."
5,Excellent breadmaker,"This is an excellent breadmaker, and is very reasonably priced.I love that the bread is shaped like a regular loaf.I would definitely recommend it to anyone."
1,Junk,"Failed bread every time. New yeast, new flour, multiple recipe sources and nothing works. I've hand made bread for years and was talked into getting a machine ""it'll make life easier"". Ya right, it's an oversize paper weight! I've wasted time and flour on this with nothing to show for it. If you want a machine made bread get a different one or buy from bread from a store. Me I'm going back to how my Mother made it - time management and elbow grease."
1,Absolutely horrible customer service,"I tried to order a new bread pan for my Oster bread machine and they sent the wrong one. In the next call they argued with me about whether or not it was the right one (it just doesn't fit). They have offered to refund my money once the item has been returned, but I can't get them to find the correct pan. They don't even have e-mail so I can send pictures to show how it should fit and they won't call me to tell me when they have found the correct pan. They told me to call back in 6 to 8 weeks!"
2,quality control problem with this model,"We've had our bread machine for a long time and it never made a good loaf of bread. The bread is always heavy and doesn't rise enough. We mainly use our Oster to make pizza dough -- or dough for cinnamon rolls. I suspect that the heating element does not come on to help the dough rise -- that may explain why there are so many one star reviews. Some people are fortunate and got a machine that worked I guess. Word of advice: Don't be so high and mighty (in your review) if you got a good machine -- you are not an expert baker and the people who got bad results are not ""doing something wrong"" --- they just got a bad machine that doesn't work. They didn't test them at the factory.The crust select button doesn't work on ours either."
2,Buy with caution,"The first machine I got didn't work properly so I called the manufacturer and they were very helpful and sent me a replacement. The replacement didn't work at all. They weren't quite as friendly when I called the second time but sent me another machine. It squeeks a lot when kneading and I'm not sure about that, although, it bakes bread fine. I'm still skeptical but will give it a chance. I would say ""buy with caution"", however, most people seem to have no troubles with this machine."
3,It's OK,The Top of the bread sinks a little in the last stage of baking. The main complaint is the thick dark crust and I put the crust setting on lite. Is there a way to compensate for getting it not so dark and so thick and hard with the crust. Maybe less time at the end.
1,Terrible!!!,"DO NOT BUY THIS BREAD MACHINE!!!! The bread never comes out right. We've tried it 3 times and the bread has ALWAYS failed to rise and is gummy in the middle. When making dough, it just pushes all the flour to the side and it doesn't mix. This product is TERRIBLE!!!"
2,Died after only 6 months,"My mother got this as a gift for me after my other bread machine died. This bread machine kneads dough very nicely and the loaves of bread I baked in it came out fine. I prefer baking my bread in the oven, but when I need quick sandwich bread I use the bread machine. However, this bread machine is loud, much louder than the Breadman machine I had before. Also, my machine died today after only 6 months of use. I used it 1-3 times a week. My previous Breadman brand machine lasted 4 years."
1,"I'm with the other ""one stars"" collapsed loaves galore","I had an older Oster that worked great for a long time. I never dreamed that getting a newer model--which really looks very similar to my old model--would work so poorly. Several collapsed loaves in a row, making for a very lousy loaf of bread. I'm returning mine. What a hassle. At least it looks like the return process for Amazon looks relatively easy. I've never returned anything to Amazon before."
1,What a Disappointment!,"I was wary of this machine after reading the mixed reviews. I am sad to say that my experience was the same as those who have posted negative reviews. I read through the instruction booklet that came with the machine very carefully. I followed the recipe for Light Rye Bread to the letter. The loaf (if you can even describe the results as that) collapsed in the middle, but the appearance was no where near as bad as the taste and texture! The center of the loaf had lumps of unmixed dough inside and the texture was so dense (almost cake like). The 'loaf' went in the bin - it was inedible. This is my first bread machine, but I am an experienced cook and baker - I cannot think of what, but perhaps I did something wrong??!! I could play around with the recipes as some of the other reviewers have, but I don't see why I should if the machine is not capable of making a recipe devised by the manufacturer. Needless to say, the machine is being returned :(."
5,Great Machine!,"I bought this bread machine because my nephew owns the same one. It is easy to use/clean, makes great bread and a better price than most other machines. It does have a big foot print but that is not an issue in my kitchen."
1,"Waste of money, effort and time","I bought this machine because a site that reviews bread makers rated this as the best of the inexpensive bread makers. If this is the best, I shudder to think what is the worst. Every loaf has rock-hard crust and fallen top, except the one that rose to the point it lifted the lid before baking even started, and burned. This machine is worse than worthless. Spent the money on the Zojirushi, and it was WELL worth it. Once I made a few adjustments for altitude, failures are rare."
1,This machine is going back,"I have owned two bread machines in the past and both worked excellent. The first one was a small inexpensive machine so I bought an Oster 3 or 4 years ago. It worked great but I finally destroyed 2 paddles and eventually the pan. I just bought an Oster 5838 and for the past week and many attempts, I am taking it back to Kohls. My old recipes don't work, the ones that came with the machine don't work. I have tried new and different brands of bread machine flour and yeast and no luck. I tried adjusting my recipes their recipes and the only ones eating fresh homemade bread are the birds and the squirles in my backyard."
3,Halfway decent,"The paddle stopped working after about 10 loaves. I also had to use a rubber spatula to help mix in the flour that got stuck in the corners. I was given this unit by a friend so I did not have a warranty and didn't care about salvaging or replacing the unit. I also don't know how many times my friend had used it (I'm guessing not much). I had no interaction with the customer service department so I can't comment on that.I experienced what a lot of people have, with the bread falling in the middle. I found that if no one was home or if everyone was *very* still, the bread did not fall. Only then was this the bread was the best gluten-free bread my household has ever eaten. So, if you are meticulous enough to keep a souffle from falling, you could make a decent loaf of bread with this machine. Otherwise, it's a waste of your time and money."
1,Beyond Junk,"Congratulate me. I just discovered something beyond Junk: the Oster 5838 is Superjunk. I could warn you about the bread pan's cheap quality and kiddie size, or the non-functioing color selector. But I prefer to evaluate the bread. My favorite recipe is always delicious prepared in the West Bend and Hitachi. Baked in the Oster, it was, in a word, disgusting. In addition to the rise being low--the loaf looked like a distresed brick and felt like lead--the texture was mealy and the crust was overly thick and stiff.The Great Depression survivors who raised me taught me not to waste food. To this day I take their admonition as axiomatic. So, when I tell you that I threw this loaf into the trash, you know I'm talking seriously inedible.Keep searching."
1,Died an early death,Bread machine seemed to work well for a few months. Maybe used it a total of 15-20 times and it died after about 8-9 months.....unfortunately after the return period had ended. Still looks brand new sitting in my trash can :(
1,Bread machine was a bust...,"Bought this machine to replace my old Oster (which worked great). Every loaf of bread was a dense disaster. Machine seems to be programmed with one too many (or a poorly timed) kneading cycle, which knocks all of the air out of the dough, then, the bake cycle starts before the dough has time to recover. Regret donating my old machine to charity. Wish I had it instead of this lost cause."
1,Not worth the price,"This item is not what I expected. It was definitly not worth the $75.00 I spent. Claims to have the option to program a start time, but this is only for complete bread cycles, not for dough only recipes. The lid pops off everytime you open it all the way. The machine itself is quite large, with the controls taking up over 60% of the machine size. This machine does not have an ""extras"" bin to allow the machine to add things like nuts or fruit to the dough at the appropriate time so they aren't smashed to bits by the kneading process. Should have spent just a bit more and got a good machine, like a Breadman."
4,breadmachine,"I like this machine just fine. The bread is good and it is easy to use.The only thing I don't quite get about this machine is the dough option. The instructions state to let it rise on a counter for 1 hour before baking, yet it has been in the machine for over an hour to get to this point."
1,If you are single do not buy this machine,"I got this machine because it advertised it would make a 1 lb, 1 1/2 lb and 2 lb loaf of bread. I am single and only make 1 lb loaves. The instruction book that came with it had no reference to 1 lb loaves. I sent an email to Oster asking about this. They didn't even bother to reply. I baked 12 hockey pucks and finally sent it to the local landfill. The West Bend bread maker actually bakes a 1 lb loaf easily. I will never buy an Oster product again."
2,"Works fine, but delivered used when labeled as new","The breadmaker itself is fine. However, Amazon or its partner labeled the item as ""new"" and I paid a ""new"" price, not the amount for a used breadmaker. It was factory sealed/resealed. When I opened it to use it the first time, I was dismayed to find crumbs surrounding the mixing blade and a sticky material below the heating element."
5,Oster Bread Machine,"I love my Oster bread machine! We have recently gone gluten free, and cannot eat wheat products. We are using Gluten free bread mixes in our machine, and the bread is great. Would recommend it to everyone!"
4,LOVE having bread in 58 minutes!,"Although I have a breadmaker, I purchased this one since the description says it makes horizontal bread loaves...IT DOES NOT! That was VERY disappointing but the fact that I can make delicious bread in under an hour makes up for it! For the express cycle, the directions state that all ingredients must be at room temperature. I did this the first time but the next time I was in a hurry and didn't have time so I put the ingredients in cold, coming from the refrigerator and the freezer and the bread turned out terrific! The only downfall is that the sides of the bread are a little dark, not burned, but darker than the top. Outside of this and the fact that this is not horizontal loaves, I love this breadmaker!"
5,Love this machine,"I have been using my Oster ExpressBake for years and love it. It's quiet and powerful enough to handle whole wheat dough. I did have to order a new pan and paddle because I used the original ones to the point that the nonstick was coming off, but had no unpleasant issues with Oster's customer service. I would highly recommend this machine."
1,Lousy bread,"Years ago bought a breadmaker for my mom, which worked for a few years, then just died one day. A second breadmaker worked for years and produced the best bread ever. (Sorry, can't recall the name of the first, but the second one was from a now-defunct manufacturer.) The bread pan broke on the second one but could not get a repalcement due to the manufacturer going out of business.So I bought this model--and hated it from the beginning. The other two breadmakers had the tall bread pans; this one has the long bread pan which tries to create a ""normal"" looking loaf of bread. As a result most of the bottom of every loaf when finished baking was torn up by the paddle that mixes and kneads the dough.The bread was always tough. The crust of the bread was especially hard. I tried all the settings adjustments--no matter what I tried it came out the same: terrible bread."
5,OSTER BREADMAKER,"Oster 5838 ExpressBake Breadmaker, WhiteThe Oster Breadmaker worked beyond our wildest expectations! So far, we've made loaves of white & wheat bread, a loaf of white French bread and loaves of gluten-free white and wheat bread - all delicious. The 2lb. standard loaves are huge, crusty outside, moist and delicious inside - they lasted only one day (read fattening) in our home and there are only two of us. A bonus is that it is so easy and so much fun to watch. We've only used the 3 hr. recipes, but look forward to the 58 and 120 min. ones and to the 13 hr. pre-set version. We can't imagine how cool it will be to start it at 5 PM and wake up to fresh bread smells at 6 AM!! We also want to try the sour dough recipe. Buy it and you will not be disappointed. We liked it so much, we bought two more for our kids. [...]"
3,"Pretty Good Machine, in the early years","This is my second Oster breadmachine. My first was a sunbeam. Belt broke after four years of weekly use. I was quite happy with it.Have had this two years, and up until two months ago it was great. Now sometimes I get a brick, sometimes I get mush. I began noticing that flour in the corners wasn't getting into the batter. I think some machines do not have adequate power, which explains why mine is doing a poor job now, when it did a good one before - belt or gears or motor are wearing down. It's an issue of quality control and manufacture. The design is fine, so long as the motor and gears work efficiently. With any loss of power, the result is poor.They are a great company, recipes are nice. They need to up the power on the unit, or create more reliable and efficient power train. Otherwise, very nice, and well-engineered."
1,I miss my old breadmaker,"I purchased this breadmaker when my old one was accidentally dropped off the counter. I am so disappointed I am giving it to Goodwill after using it 3 times. First of all, it is flimsy. The top comes off every time you open it and the handle of the bread pan comes off as well. The part that irks me the most is that the blade bakes into the bread and you have to cut open the bread to get it out. It was the biggest waste of money. I even feel bad giving it to Goodwill because that means that someone else will try to use it. However, I feel badly just throwing it in the trash."
5,great bread machine!,"This bread machine makes wonderful bread and is very easy to clean. It's not too big and fits nicely in my small kitchen. It's easy to use too, which is helpful since it is my 1st bread machine. I would definitely recommend it!"
5,best pizza wer ever had,"Love this machine. I made cheese bread, whole wheat bread, pizza, bagels and many more things and everything was great. The machine saves me a lot of time. Love it."
4,My 2nd Oster,"This is the fourth Oster appliance for me with pretty good luck with all so why change? Plus, hard to beat the price. Same problem with both bread machines, their loaves are just too large but slice them in half length ways and make two slices from one works okay. I like the express bake and the quality of bread is equal to standard bake. I have also stopped at last rise and transferred dough to standard bread pans and give about 30 minute rise and bake in oven for 35 minutes. No need to spend up to $300 when this one will work just as good (or maybe better)"
3,Weary Bros.,"It was a little too much in the traditional bluegrass mode for me, with one or two exceptions that were not and I liked those just fine."
3,Alt. country will never die!,"Very nice outing from wb. Not many originals here, and not much in length of album, but still very entertaining. Most songs pretty upbeat and fast, and you definately get a feel for their musical chops. Good alt. country band"
1,Worthless piece of crap,"Dr. Goldfoot and the Girl Bomb is even worse than the movie that preceded it (Dr. Goldfoot and the Bikini Machine). I'm not sure what is worse, the poorly dubbed dialog of the two foreign comedians or the portion where the characters are moving their lips but only music can be heard. I appreciate good satire but this is humorless confusion in need of a script. It is any wonder that another sequel was not made?"
4,"nice for marination, not for storage","you have to love the capability to do quick marination - you can see the liquid and air bubbles leaving the product when you draw a vacuum - this is NOT good for storing anything long-term (just like the cannisters, the seal bleeds off regardless of what you do!) I even tried using mine daily to store my coffee and it would be un-sealed by the next morning"
1,Broke after first use,"Used this for marinading some steaks and it went through the marinading cycle without a problem. My problem came when I attempted to remove the hose that leads to the vacuum sealer. When removing the hose, the plastic place that the hose attaches to came off with the hose. My marinading canister is now useless."
4,Fun and easy to use.,We grill a lot and this product works great. I can tell a taste difference bc the seasoing is pulled in to the meat.
3,"It marinates meat, that's for sure...","While it performs its job and it's constructed ok (the gasket thing is pretty annoying at times), it doesn't do anything else. I hate when I have something in the kitchen that only does one thing.I don't find myself reaching for this to store anything, because it's so shallow and wide that it takes up way too much room in the fridge and it doesn't allow for stacking stuff on top, so it kind of makes me mad when I'm not marinating meat."
2,Fragile - do not drop!,"Worked exactly as advertised - until I dropped it the first time. Shattered like glass. Now I have a spare lid to go with the replacement I am buying, which I will treat with much greater care. If this one doesn't last, I'll be done with this product."
5,Nice!,"They want Me to write My whole lifes story in this section just to make a review to say something simple like, I like it!"
2,Just...Eh.,"I purchased this to help ""quick marinate"" my steaks. I purchased it based on all the reviews that stated this item did just that. Maybe I got a bad one, but it just doesn't seem to quickly marinate any type of meat I put in it. The first time I used it, it seemed to do what it was supposed to. Every use after that has been a failure. Everything looks great (rubber seal, no visible cracks, etc), but it just seems not to work. I am planning to get rid of this product in the future, it sits in the cupboard more often than not and takes up space."
1,BEWARE!!!,This product DOES NOT work for newer food savers without the large jar attachment. When I tried to return it I had problems with customer service and had to file a claim with amazon. what a headache!!
1,Food saver dish,The ad says it will pull the marianade deeply into the meat. It does not. It is no better than a Cool-Whip bowl. Not worth the miney.
2,Seal does not hold,"I purchased this product a short time ago, but the one I received did not hold a seal. How do I return this item and get a replacement?"
1,Missing Part,"I ordered this product because I wanted to try a new recipe which required using skirt steak. This steak is flavorful but needs to be marinaded, as it can be tough. I wanted to try it over the weekend. The product came, missing a major piece. I sent it back and decided not to reorder it, since there were only 3 main pieces and I would think it should be simple to pack correctly."
2,Please improve product description,"The product itself is great - for storage. Nowhere in the product description was it made clear that you need a separate FoodSaver appliance to use this product as a marinator. The container requires a vacuum pump that is sold separately, so what I now have is an overpriced Tupperware container. Thanks!"
1,Completely useless. No vacuum pump! Description is misleading.,"This package does not come with a vacuum pump which makes it completely useless. If it came with a pump, even at twice the cost, it would have been extremely cool. The container seems like it is very good quality. But I will have to return it. I just wanted to marinate some meat for the grill. I have no intention of buying the whole $150 ""Foodsaver System"" which would occupy a large amount of counter space. No thank you. I am returning it."
1,Warning! Not a complete unit!,"Warning! The description for this unit is misleading! While this item seem's to be well constructed and just might work as advertized, it is meant to work as an accessory for a powered food sealing system (Foodsaver brand ?)and will do nothing on its own other than serve as a high prices storage container! For a self contained marinator, look at the following item.Vacu Vin 2977450 2-1/2-Quart Instant Marinating Container"
5,Works very well,"If you need a somewhat larger container for marinating with the FoodSaver, or simply for keeping other foods, this is certainly worth buying."
4,A little on the small side,"I really like this product and it has worked well for the few times we have already used it but have two minor nits,1) Too small for a family of 6 (so I just purchased another)2) Not submursing top to clean has me worried about food safety"
5,super moist,"chicken thighs are moist, but after using marinator they were almost dripping with moistness and FLAVOR!!!!"
4,I Wish It Held More Chicken....,"It seems to work fine and my chicken had a wonderful flavor in a short time. I do wish that it held more, but for two people it is fine."
1,Broke and left pieces of plastic in our food,We had part of the lid break off in use and did not realize it until we were biting into chunks of plastic deeply embedded into our chicken breasts. We thought the plastic was in the chicken from the grocery store until the next time we tried to use the marinator and discovered it would no longer seal because of the piece of plastic that had broken off the lid.
5,Must have for Food Saver,This is a must have for Food Saver users. We have been exceptionally pleased with the tenderizing and flavouring when we utilize it to marinade meat quickly.
1,it failed after a few years,"I bought the system when it first came out. Over the years all the plastic containers have failed. Small cracks so they don't seal anymore. We had marinade, large and small containers...all have failed. $100's of dollars wasted. I liked to use it for soups, marinades so the bags are not practical for me."
5,Huge timesaver for tasty meat dishes,"The instructions say you can marinate something for as little as 20 minutes -- and it's true. The first time I tried I marinating chicken breasts in a simple homemade marinade (olive oil, lemon juice, herbes de provence, dried minced onion and garlic powder) for barbecue, and the result was extremely tender and tasty. I've sinced used it for fish and beef as well, and have gotten better results than I ever did with the old overnight conventional method. It's sturdy and well-made -- you can put the bottom dish in the dishwasher, but wash the top/lid carefully by hand in order to save wear and tear on the gasket."
5,Jill's review of the FoodSaver Square Canister,"I have used the FoodSaver Square Canister for marinating steak tips. It works fast to marinate and also as a storage container for buns without perservatives. The sealing process works easily and you can hear the air leave the unit when you move the round dial to open. I think this is a very handy tool for cooking, preserving and marinating."
1,Cracks for no apparent reason,"I love Foodsaver and use the marinator alot because of the large storage size. The first one I bought it two years ago and it stopped working. I used a lot so I was ok with that and proceeded to buy 2 marinators a few months ago. 1 of the 2 has already cracked for no apparent reason. I don't have a dishwasher so that's not the problem.I read alot of other reviews on another website about random cracking, but I ignored them. I love Foodsaver products except for this marinator. I'd be okay if it broke every few years, but every few months is not acceptable."
4,Works good and has held up well,"I have had mine for more than 3 years now and I really like it. I really cannot tell a difference between meat marinated under vacuum or in another container save for the marinade stays in the foodsaver and does not leak out like the other containers I have tried and it is this ""leak proof"" feature that keeps me using it. I have put this in the dishwasher and it has done just fine. The only thing I would change is to make the container about 1/2 inch deeper so I can fit my roasts in better.I am expecting it to start cracking at somepoint as that is what happens to plastic under stress and as plastic ages. The only option to prevent cracking is to use glass and then I am sure there will still be people complaining that the glass broke or that it was too heavy."
1,Wouldn't waste my money on another one,"Over the last few years, I've had two of these. The first one developed stress cracks in the bottom, which worked their way through to the inside rendering the casserole useless. Since it was out of warranty, they would not replace it. So, I bought another (couldn't just buy the bottom). Within six months, the bottom started developing cracks in the same place. Needs redesigning to alleviate the stress points."
5,great,"This canister has 3 different settings on it, if you have a cooler FoodSaver it will remove the air, hold, then release the air, and repeat over and over. If you don't you can set it to work like normal canisters where you just take the air out and it stays that way.Either way the thing works great, and it's a very solid canister. The others I've had (non marinating) are a soft plastic but this is a hard plastic with a really nice seal. It's pretty big too."
1,Worked once,"Nice concept, but don't waste your money on this product. It worked fine one time. After washing it (by hand), can't get it to vacuum seal any more. I checked that the gasket is in place and found no cracks or food particles in the product. Taking it back to see if I can return it."
1,VHS!!!,Short review here guys... Who owns a VHS player these days. I didn't realize that I was purchasing a VHS tape. It would be nice if they converted to a DVD...
2,A band on a mission!,"Los Tigres del Norte have a beef. You see, it seems that many of us use the word ""America"" as an abbreviation for the full name of our country, the United States of America. And we refer to ourselves as ""Americans."" In fact, this is generally understood around the world. (It's doubtful that Iran's government was referring to Paraguay when it denounced ""America"" as ""The Great Satan."") However, Los Tigres think this is awful, just awful, and so they actually did a whole song on this CD about how unfair it is for us to refer to our nationality as American. So since Los Tigres are a little on the uptight side, it might be best for you to call yourself a ""United Statester"" or ""USA dude/dudette"" etc. in their presence lest they hurl a squeeze box at you."
3,Clean Design,"Clean design, nice addition to my desk. Pattern design is only uses about 1/3 of the total base. Recommend the curved, bowl, shape if you want a larger more detailed pattern."
5,This was one of the best books I've read!,"I found this book suspensefull and thrilling, although it is slo in some parts, especially the beggining. Besides a few faults, This book was one of the best I've ever read. The storyline kept me reading through the few dull parts. I reccomend this book to anyone that likes fantasy and adventure."
5,"Excellent, a must for every Myst fan.",This was almost the best book I ever read. A definite two thumbs up. END
2,Disappointing,"Great ideas like the writing of worlds, great settings like de D'ni underground city, characters with a lot of potential... but the writing style is awful, nothing really ever happened in the book, jump like a frog in the rain, too much emphasis in stupid little details, and a fairy tale ending. I dind't like it. Its a real shame because the book hardcover is beautiful. A book to put in a shelf, nothing more."
4,Cyan,"This book brings back such pleasant memories of playing Mist, Uru, etc. We loaned this book out and it came back so well read that I had to buy a new one!"
4,"The Book of Atrus (Myst, Book 1)",I purchased this book for my son. He and I are really into the Myst saga. The book tends to explain more of what is going on.
5,The Best Book I've Ever Read.,"This book is, by far, the best book I've ever read. The descriptivness of the scenary and plot are amazing, I actually felt like I was walking through exploring these extraordinary worlds. This is truely a masterpeice of literature. I have not yet read the other books, but no mater, no other book could match the genious put forth in The Book of Atrus. If I could recommend any book, it would be this one. It is worth the read."
5,A clear picture of Atrus' life before the CD-ROM game,"This book gives you what Atrus, ruler of Myst island, experienced as a child to when he reached his late teens. When he first reached ten, he traveled with his long lost father, Gehn, to the underground world of D'ni. After studying the D'ni Art(writting 'worlds' or 'ages' through books), Gehn restricted Atrus' privliges and soon came to the point where there were serious problems. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the MYST game or is an interest for reading it. This book also gives you how Riven became a problem in the sequel to the game MYST, RIVEN."
4,Brain Candy...,"I would have to say that this book, while not a prize winner, holds up well on its own. It has an interesting story and characters with whom you can empathize. At times the wording could be too flowery yet the story was fast enough that the reader could consider this brain candy...fun and easy to read."
5,Best book I've probably ever read!,"""The best book I've ever read"" is a very good compliment for this book, because I ALWAYS read! Even on nights when I have to wake up early in the morning for school! I can stay up until 2:00 am, if a book is excellent. This was one of those books. I absolutely couldn't put it down!!! :)"
5,AMAZING BOOK!!!,"Myst: The Book of Atrus is one of the best books I've ever read. The only regret I have about it is that I loaned it to a friend, and now I can't get it back to re-read. D'ni, the different Ages, and Ghent, Atrus' insane father combine to create a fantastic book. If you haven't read it you should, and you HAVE to read it if you've played the game Myst."
4,I loved the concept,"I did not play any of the Myst games, but now that I've read this first book I think I will buy all of them. I can't wait to continue reading the second book of this series. I actually expected this to be a war book with elves and dwarves (not actually elves and dwarves, but you know what I mean) and when nobody got killed in the first hundred pages I thought I would stop reading (since I love violence of course). But I found I couldn't just put it down, so I finished it and I'm glad I did. It was worth the change in pace from what I usually read."
5,Beautiful,"This book starts off where BoT (Book of Ti'ana) had left off. It introduces young Atrus as he begins to learn the D'ni life and their past. Atrus learns everything, from the life of his grandfather, his mother, and the D'ni through the voice of his grandmother, Anna. When his father, Gehn, a son of the couple Anna (Ti'ana) and the fated Aitrus, comes into the cleft to pick up his son to take him to D'ni. Atrus begins to learn more about D'ni life, their culture, their talents, everything. Until his father became mad.The Book of Atrus is yet another fantastic novel written by the talented Rand Miller. It leaves a wonderful ending for the PC game Riven: The Sequel to Myst which is a computerized/playable sequel of this novel. This is one of the finest novels alongside Book of Ti'ana. It introduces our hero Atrus in his young life. This is definitely recommended and it's a wonderfully written novel. I highly recommend it!"
4,Very good as a supplement to the games,"""Myst: The Book of Atrus"" serves very nicely as a supplement to the games ""Myst"" and ""Riven,"" nicely filling in parts of the story that the games leave out. It also works, though, as a stand-alone story -- I have to admit, the idea of travel through books (literally, not figuratively) is quite original, and very appealing. This, along with the other two ""Myst"" books, augments the games well; the writing style seems to come from the same mind that created the game (actually, it did.) ""The Book of Atrus"" serves better as a gudie to the beginning of Riven, because Myst's appeal was in its mystery (hence the name ""Myst."") A better overview to the entire Myst/Riven universe is the ""Book of Ti'ana,"" wherein is told the story of the fall of mighty D'ni. Overall, this book rates an eight -- I recently gave Tolkien's ""The Hobbitt"" a ten, and while a good piece of fantasy, ""The Book of Atrus"" just doesn't match up to that sort of competition."
4,Great fun for kids!,"I read this book when I was younger and only remember great things. Looking back on it now I can tell that the writing isn't exactly scholarly, but that doens't matter, Myst is a fun adventure story that all kids and teens should enjoy. And no, I'm not a big fan of fantasy myself, but I had no trouble getting drawn in."
4,Interesting story for an interesting game,"I was impressed by the game of Myst and intruiged by the complex and detailed back-story it seemed to have. So, I bought the novels. This novel gives more detail in to the life of Atrus, whom you meet in the game. For those who like to get involved with characters, this book gives great insight into Atrus, his experiences, and his motivations."
4,Interesting...,"This was a good book, with a great intro. One of my favorite intros to a book ever! I'm not sure why, but I just like it. :) Starts off fantastic, settles into good for the rest of the ride. Worth a read if you're a myst fan."
5,"Myst, The Book of Atrus","This book, the first of a bunch of books (the other books are Myst, The Book of Ti'ana and Myst, The book of Dni) This book is the best I have ever read, and it makes you feel like you are in the story. It is the story that is based on the game. It is about mastering pieces of parchment that can lead you into other worlds. The boy, Atrus thought the stories his Grandmother told him were just legends, but then his father turns up who he has not seen in a while, and that is where his adventure starts"
5,I loved this book.,I loved the characters in this book. There was so much MUSTery about the characters. I gave me a wiered fealing when they went into D'ni (Dun-hee).If you liked this book you should read MYST: The book of Ti'ana(sp). It fills in most of the holes that are left in this book.
4,Interesting world vs. Dull plot,This book has an interesting world but a rather dull plot. It doesn't hold a candle to The Wheel of Time series but will probably satisfy any gamers or people who enjoy the more unique and new fantasy ideas
4,"Not great, but good","This book lets you undrestand the story of Myst much better. It reads great, exept for the overuse of words ""jet black"""
2,Not what you get,What is in the picture is not what you get ! The part number is for a different item !
5,Hi 5 Season 4,My Grandson loves Hi-5! We have all the songs memorizedbecause we watch it over and over again!
3,no Spanish into the considerations for latin kids?,"still amazes me how can some producers are missing the fact of the relevance of adding spanish to their titles. While our daughters are being taught in English as they are in Spanish....your missing a big chunk, when spanish is not offered as a language."
2,Cheaper to buy 2 volumes separately,"Good series; however, if you plan to buy the combo set, be sure to check on buying vol 1 and vol 2 separately. It is often cheaper. Buying the combo set seems to be just a trick to get the consumer to pay more just to have a cardboard box to keep the two sets in. There is no different in the amount of time on the sets. Vol 1 has 567 minutes and vol 2 has 589 minutes. Combined that's 1156 minutes, the same as this set. But then going up in price on this combo might be a trick just to make the two volumes seem reasonable in price."
3,Love the show but why not just release all of it at once,"Ok this review is not for the show but how it is released. I loved the show when it was on TV and I have waited patiently for it to come out on DVD, but this piece meal BS is just too much. Just release the whole thing at once and be done with it. It is not like you have to wait for them to complete the episodes or something. *headdesk*"
5,Great Bit of Nostalgia,"Robert Urich was a talented actor (even if they made him wear those ridiculously-tight jeans). This show not only had good writing, it also captured the flash & exitement of Las Vegas. I also like the humorous characters who guest-starred in several episodes. Besides....who wouldn't want to park their vintage T-Bird convertible inside their house & just hop out without opening the door? The outfits of that period will make you smile."
1,Terrible!,As an Occupational Therapist I was interested in using these CD's during therapy sessions. The songs are so horrible I can't listen to most of them from start to finish. Most of my clients have auditory sensitivity and the deep pressure calming song is nerve racking.
4,A Good Reference,If you have never owned Zebra Finches this might be a good starter book for you. It was really handy when I discovered some of those eggs (that my friends tell me don't hatch) had actually hatched. I scurred and made sure the environment was beneficial to raise young birds. This has good general information and is handy to keep near the cage supplies.
4,"A very interesting ""opera prima"". Good pop-soul album.","Juanita Dailey is young, gorgeous, has a superb voice and has the privilege of having great musicians on her debut album (Norman Brown, the E.W.F. horn section, Norman Connors, Paulinho da Costa, the lead singer from the Temptations on a remarkable duo, etc.), and is backed up by Dionne Warwick !. We will nevertheless have to wait for her follow-up to find out was she can really do, because this album contains too many cover versions (Deniece Williams's ""Free"", for instance, though it is a good cover version) to get a real idea of what she is capable of. Moreover, ""Love Hurts"" (with a sort of ""Barry White slow tempo"") is probably not the best choice to open up the album and as a ""single"". This will certainly ""hurt"" the image of the album, which is not hip hoppish and is a good buy if you like what I call ""pop-soul""."
3,"In the days of the box set,",Yeah it's got the mood there fella but really lacks the fullness I was looking for. A great video would have at least had 3 songs per performance. Morrissey's song was cut and that was dissapointing. I got the film to see that and it was like 2 min 25 seconds long. OK.This video is really just a preview of what could have been and isn't. Rent. Don't buy.
2,festival advertisement,There isn't much performance footage on this. It is more like an advertisement... to get you to go and roast your butt off in that sun out there where you end up praying for the night time!! There. That's my advertisement.
2,"Pretty, Pretty Bad","Most of the reviews here are dead-on but I can add some. I thought this would be a straight-up concert film but as you've read it's not. It's more like somebody's indulgent college film project.Also, simply one song per act (and a bad one for Morrissey) and a bevy of little-known acts that don't deserve the time onscreen...blech. The Chili Peppers phone in ""Californication"" in an already sleepy film.The ONLY good thing about this is Radiohead's absolutely floor-stomping performance. They simply kill with their 3 minutes.Sadly, nobody else does.Skip it."
1,Annoying visuals,"The visual effects added (together with cartoons) are EXTREMELY annoying! Whenever there is an exciting passage, where I really want to see the pyrotechniques of Carl and Keith, the effects appear and make me unable to identify any details. I think these 'effects' last almost a half of entire production. The visuals are, at least in my opinion, third-class. I wonder whether these visuals were inherent to the original master or not, since I could not see the LD released sometime ago."
3,Only good as an historical artifact,"This performance shows the band at a very young age, not very long after they got together as a group. The elements are there for future greatness, but they are yet to have finely honed their music. The visual effects are not uncommon for late-60s, early-70s concert videos, but now they look clumsy and ridiculous, and take away from the experience of seeing the group perform. Which is why this DVD is not up to modern standards, but is a worthwhile and interesting historical record of the band ""in the beginning,"" and of video recording standards of the time."
2,What a waste!,"I was really excited to see a recording of ELP in their prime, but I was in for a disappointment. As soon as things started to heat up, annoying visual effects cover the entire screen. The majority of the footage is unrecognizable as a result. Only at the very end can you clearly see the band performing. Don't waste your time and money on this. Listen to the album instead!"
3,Reasonably priced wine rack,"This wine rack is really pretty. It should really go on hard floors, as it's pretty wobbly on a carpeted area. I was very pleased with the price I paid, but it did come to me with a few dings & nicks on it, & it says right on the package that it was ""carefully packed, in good condition"" & that if it has scratches that it's the shipper's fault. That's bogus. Anything packed that well isn't getting scratched up during shipping- but oh well. It's a good option if you don't want to pay a lot."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money!!!,"The wine rack arrived promptly and was packed well. However, upon opening the box, I found a 2-inch crack on the table surface. I didn't bother to return the wine rack as I intended to cover the top with a piece of decorative cloth anyway.It's now about a month since I received my order. Not only has the crack lengthened by twice its original length, the other side of the top surface is beginning to crack too!I'm going to chuck the rack! Don't waste your money or time with this item!"
5,love it,"This item was easy to put together. A multi purpose peice of furniture, and perfect for small or corner spaces."
5,Adds elegance to the room. Does it's job. I like it,"As the title says, it looks nice. It was easy to put together and it holds the wine well. Feels sturdier than I thought it would."
2,Think twice before you switch,I used Verizon for 3 years before switching to AT&T.; Price plans seemed identical so I wasn't too concerned. Problem is I had to pay $60 to activate the two phones I got. Didn't care too much about that until I got the first bill and found $20 in bogus fees and charges tacked on to the bill. Verizon's bogus junk was always less than $10.I'll be switching back to Verizon when the contract is done. Customer service was mediocre (about the same as Verizon's). Bogus charges kill the deal.
3,Three Billy Goats Fruff Sound Book,"The book was not packaged correctly, and the corners of the book were damaged in shipment. It was the correct book and the book was usable. Two pieces of carboard would have saved the book from damage."
2,"Marcia Brown's 1957 ""Billy Goats Gruff""","PS - I agree: How lame that Amazon has mixed together reviews for all these various versions of ""Three Billy Goats Gruff."" They are all so different and all by different illustrators and authors!Anyway, this is a comment about Marcia Brown's 1957 version, which I found to be incredibly gory. Rather than merely knock the troll off the bridge, this billy goat gruff graphically dismembers him, poking out his eyes and reducing him to ""bits, body and bones."" Yuck! There are other, mellower version out there... This one's not a favorite. (ReadThatAgain!)"
2,Great Tunes - Not Quality Product,"Admittedly, I do not have the MelBay version of the songbook, but I do have another publisher's version. My quarrel with the book is the poor quality of the print. The book I have is clearly a collection of reprographic copies, most of which are not clear and clean. The tunes are fabulous and quite an extensive collection. They're all great tunes, and I think this is an excellent collection. I just caution buyer's to make sure the quality of the print is up to par."
4,arrived on Time,The item arrived on time & it seems to be working well & I have no issues with it at all. It was nice to find it cheaper.
1,Not worth it,"I have been involved with Lean for 10+ years and have served as an internal consultant and internal change agent for the last several years. I am always looking for material that helps me to learn about new ideas or helps others pick up the tools and concepts, but was very disappointed in this book. It is a collection of ""best practices"", but only touches on a few concepts from a very high level, with the ""we had a problem, we waved a magic wand, and it was fixed"" format. There is nothing in this book that helps you figure out how to apply the concepts to what you are working on or that gives you new ideas to try. You're much better off figuring out how to apply VSM in the office, having everyone look at the process, and then develop a future state together than trying to get anything from this book."
3,OK examination of lean office,"Most lean office books are lean manufacturing books with the word ""office"" pasted in. This booklet has some of the same issues - it addresses lean manufacturing principles and calls them lean office. The structure of the book is good with titles such as ""Takeaways"", where the takeaways are sometimes limited: ""A focus on meeting cusomer needs is critical"".Overall, this book is valuable to gather ideas about what some companies have done - it is case study based and is not in-depth or even BEST practices.A more detailed look at lean office can be seen in Michael George's Lean Six Sigma for Service."
2,enjoyable,"The script takes Jane Seymour away from her usual role as ""good guy"" or sympathetic female.. who needs a hero to help her..The audience knows at the very beginning she is the ""bad guy""..but her compelling performance of the ""abused woman"" keeps us in suspence to find out why this ""black widow"" is doing these murderous deeds.. A good suspence. but only 2 stars.. directing and editing gets a 1/2 star.."
5,This Item Rocks,"I used the Wacom 12x12 for the first time while working at my last job. I was hesitant about using it, feeling that my artwork would suffer and that I should just scan my work. Was I ever as wrong about anyhing in my life? Yes, but that has nothing to do with this review... To put it simply, I was converted and pretty soon, I felt that I couldn't do any work without my trusty Wacom! The ability to create work directly in Illustrator and Photoshop made my life so much easier and the precision available beats using a mouse for almost anything hands down. If you do graphics for fun/profit/whatever this should definitely be in your bag of tricks. To be honest, I've never tried any comparable products but many people I knew had and every one of them felt that the Wacom Intuos line was the best they'd ever used."
5,The Pinnacle,"The soundtrack of 'Ladies in Lavender' would be, without doubt, one of the most beautiful scores I have listened to. The melodies composed by Nigel Hess are so sensitive and hauntingly lovely and when coupled with the interpretive mastery of Joshua Bell's violin playing, this CD is a must for every music lover."
3,A Great Cast.,This was a lovely little film with excellent acting and and interesting story. The scenery was beautiful. I enjoyed it very much.
4,Pleasant background music,The only song that makes me lift my head and notice is the theme song played by Joshua Bell. The rest is pleasant enough.
5,Sheer magic,"The soundtrack is a deep emotional journey into one's soul, there is no other way to describe it. When I saw the film, I was so engrossed by the story, that I hardly noticed the music, and only the superb Concerto for Violin and Orchestra at the end remained in my mind. That is also the reason why I purchased the soundtrack, being a bit sceptical though, because in my experience, I usually find just one or two tracks that I really like. This time it was BINGO! I love every single note of music on the CD and I congratulate and thank Joshua Bell for his sensitive, superb interpretation of Nigel Hess's deeply moving music."
3,Ladies in Lavender Soundtrack,Josh Bell is amazing but the pieces varied in volume. I was constantly tunig it music up or the volume down. Not the piece for a long drive in the country.
5,Ladies in Lavendar - Movie Soundtrack,The violin music is wonderful! I knew I wanted a copy of this soundrack when I saw the movie on DVD. Joshua Bell in a wonderful artist.
2,This book is not very clearly,"I don't like this book because there are some concepts are not very clearly. Maybe this book will be good for you, but for me is not working."
3,Too theoretical. Doesn't try to map theory to practice.,Not bad but tends to be a little too theoretical. I prefer books which illustrate a concept with examples from real life. Would prefer Tanenbaum.
3,ok book,"The book is not bad for getting ideas, but it does not help much in converting the ideas to code. You don't learn all that much for $60"
4,Read this before going into distributed computing.,This book covers the subject of OS in a very clear and concise manner. A must read for all CS majors or anybody wanting to know more about systems software.
1,save yourself a headache - don't go RICOH,"30 days after receiving a drive that didn't work, I'm still waiting for a replacement from RICOH. Each time I'm told I'll get my replacement next week. RICOH customer service is the pits and while better products are now available that cost less than what I paid for the RICOH, I still haven't written a CD."
2,"Nice drive, awful software","I installed the drive with no problems. My computer and Windows 98 recognized it right away. Then I installed the software, and the nightmare began. The company touts it as simple, and indeed it is...there is almost no user interaction involved other than copy and paste. That's basically the problem. You never know what it's doing, there is no way to determine if it's doing anything, and more than half the time it isn't. I have had to copy and paste several times on the same file to get it to record and it is very irritating. Drive 4, software 0. Buy something with better software if you can afford it."
2,Nice hardware...lack luster software,"The CD writer is solid and easy to install. The software package that comes with it is very poor at best. It's not intuitive and was shipped with no instructions. Read me files simply say ""Manual up to date""."
5,Rock solid drive and great software,The Ricoh MP7040A is a solid drive that writes audio with great sound quality. This is a fantastic bundle for writing audio CDs from free MP3 files available from many web sites. This is a great way to find new up and coming bands.
3,Be careful...,"I read all the comments from the other reviewers, and it seemed like a good drive. But, mine arrived without User's Manual, and NOT A SINGLE CD OF SOFTWARE. It only had a Quick Start guide, wich is a joke. The drive itself is very good, but be very careful...you could be dropping extra (big) bucks for software that *should* be included in the package...also, Ricoh tech support, although fast (at least in my case), gives some very, very stupid solutions..."
5,Great Laundry Bag,"We keep this in a walk-in closet to hold dress shirts on their way to the dry cleaner for laundering. This bag holds 55 mens dress shirts, and is well made of heavy canvas with metal rivets for the draw string (rope, actually).Happy with the purchase."
3,Maximizers!,"Similar to the 7 habits, coach Ron Jenson espouses the Maximizers Principles, a set of principles to eternally follow. His introduction of what is defined by Success is good. Only you can define what it means to succeed, not anyone else. How will you want others to remember you?Afterwards, it's an expanded explanation of his maximizer principles.An interesting read, but I would say some of his concepts are probably repeated elsewhere."
5,Review of Jerry Jones and the 'New Regime' Book,"This book was hard to put down once I started reading it. Mr. Cawthorn gives great insight to the world of NFL football and the ""fly on the wall"" play by play of the life of Jerry Jones. Unbelievably shocking and funny stories that will make you want to read it all the first time you pick it up."
4,Great read for cowboy fans,While Cowboys fans all felt that Jerry was a villain when he first took over the Cowboys we are now glad he did. This book shows his single minded drive to win games and championships. I have a lot of other material about the Cowboys for fans that wish to borrow them email me.
3,decent book/story,"Easy to read, enjoyable throughout. Gave a few insights into the actions (antics) of the Jones'. Granted the author (as pilot) only saw/heard what happened on the airplane. To me, kinda showed all rich people have that holier-than-thou attitude. Also, showed Jerry Jones would spend exorbitantly (LearJet) but would piss/moan about penny-pinching type stuff (Jones angrily denied flight crew some of his catered, passenger food after Jones kept them waiting over 12hrs with no chance for meal).I wish some secretary, who worked for Jones right from the start (at Valley Ranch), had written a book about the first couple of years of the Jones' regime. That would be worth buying."
3,Great; but not quite what I was expecting,"Overall a very enjoyable book, especially for the distant cowboys fan across here in the UK. Todds' love of the Cowboys is very apparent all the way through but, and maybe it's my fault for not reading the details more thoroughly, there is no direct input from Jerry Jones or any of the organisation, something that I'm sure would have made the book much more credible."
4,Not-to-be-missed is right...,"again, i'm not aiming to be as big as a truck...but this DVD, like many of Bayview's, are top quality and interesting to watch. YOu get to learn and see the everyday lives of these athletes. Great stuff!"
2,Blech,"A testament to the decline of the Pushcart Press and the Editor's Book award, this book is one mighty stinker. With the trite dialogue of a paperback romance, and the lengthy inner monologues of a soggy literary short, this book is hard to finish, unless like me you are determined to find out just what it was that convinced people to publish this book and then give it an award.A few hundred pages later, I still don't know."
2,Over-hyped,"I chose this book for our book club selection of the month because of the overwhelmingly positive reviews received from the offical reviewers and the customer reviews on this site. All of our book members were extremely disappointed with the novel. Although there are isolated sections of excellent writing and some beautiful imagery, the characters are one-dimensional and unlikeable, the plot irritating, and the tone drab and uninteresting. I am an avid reader and can enjoy most books, but I truly pushed through this one. I must admit, I usually find it helpful and enlightening to pay close attention to reviews, but this time I felt they were extremely misleading."
5,Sumptuous,"if you love flowers and words, buy this book. Every photo and every word is poetry. A great gift to give to lovers of beauty."
2,A huge disappointment!,"I've read and loved every Cheryl Holt book published. I couldn't wait for this book to come out and bought it immediately. Don't waste your time - it's a huge disappointment. The characters are shallow and unlikeable. Their behavior is completely inconsistant. Alex tries to bed every female possible early in the book then suddenly is ok with a relationship, marriage and potentially children. Ellen is supposed to have extremely high morales and focuses on keeping her reputation 'above reproach' yet she has nightly trists with Alex when she is just down the hall from his fiancee who is her friend? The supporting characters aren't much better - most of their behavior is incestuous and downright disturbing.Stick with the previous Cheryl Holt books - much more entertaining! This one's a dud."
1,Yawn......,"A huge disappointment. I have read several of Ms. Holt's books... this one isn't worth picking-up. There is very little ""romantic"" about a woman being raped by her drunken husband on her wedding night. The protagonists spent most of the story yelling at each other, and the same conversation was held by more than one couple in the story. Other than their looks, there is little to recommend the main characters. Since all the characters are related, I must only conclude that this was one heck of a dysfunctional family!!The book is too tempting to throw away."
2,Not enough buy-in,"Holt's effort gets off to a decent start. She creates the standard rakish male who seeks out frequent, short-term liasions and the standard virginal spinster who is repressing her inner seductress. The major weakness of the book starts about half-way through. There are too many storylines and too many secondary characters who seem almost peripherally related to the plot (the second son's want-to-be mistress is particularly irrelevent). Like many romance novels, there is a misunderstanding that keeps the couple from being together, but this is very poorly portrayed by Holt. It was unclear exaxtly what the hero/heroine' motivation was in staying apart. Very Confusing! My recommendation: spend you money elsewhere. You will reach the end of this book feeling a little confused and disappointed."
3,Container Too Large,"This item makes ice tea, but there are too many steps -- measure the water, add the water, measure the ice. And end up with a container half full. The 'maker' only holds enough water for 2 quarts of tea; the container would easily hold a gallon. OK -- it's mine now and I'll use it, but in this technology age it could have been a sleeker operation."
2,The worst!!!,"Don't expect to ever pour from the dispenser without spilling tea all over the place...especially when it's full. Also, don't bother e-mailing customer serice. They won't respond! I've tried it!!! I'm going with Hamilton Beach"
1,It would be difficult to design a worse tea maker,I'm giving this a one star rating only because there is no zero star option. I can't remember ever coming across a more poorly designed product. Did the manufacturer even attempt to make tea with this model? I've used this five times and had hot tea leak all over my counter every time. No matter how I place the supplied pitcher against the tea maker about one quarter of the tea ends up leaking out. The spout on the machine doesn't stick out far enough to clear the lip of the pitcher. A small steady stream of tea pours down the side of the machine every time. This is the last time I buy a Mr. Coffee product (after using their products for the past 25 years).
1,Not the Ice Tea maker shown in picture!,"Well, the product/model shipped was not the one shown in the picture. Inferior quality, bulky, just not what I wanted. That said, the vendor was very good about taking the item back and refunding my money. Paid for postage and all."
5,This thing is great,"My wife and I decided that we were spending way too much money at the local coffee shop on the way to work. My solution was easy, bring some with me from home, but she drinks Iced Tea. So we were planning on going the sun tea route. But when I looked up online where to get a good jar for it, I ended up reading all about how sun tea can breed bacteria and all that. Thats when i came across the Mr Coffee Iced Tea Maker, so I decided to give it a shot. Well we were not disappointed, the thing is easy to use and makes great iced tea. My wife says its every bit as good as the stuff she was buying at the coffee shop. Of course we have a great ice maker in our freezer, I think if you dont have an ice maker this would not be all that practical for daily use because you use a lot of ice with each batch. But long story short, this thing is great."
1,It's a great puddle maker,"I have not had any problems with the pitcher that the other reviews complain about. The problem is the filter basket. If it is not properly aligned, the brewing tea runs all over the counter instead of into the pitcher. And it has to be lined up to the millimeter. I check the alignment of the basket every time I brew tea to make sure it's aligned-- and even when it's perfect, it's still likely to not work properly.If you want to have to watch your tea brewing every time to make sure your Mr. Coffee didn't screw up again, this is the tea maker for you. If you just think things should work right when you take care of them and are careful you should look somewhere else."
1,Terrible product - leaks a lot!,"This product leaked from the first time I used it. I gave this product about five opportunities and each time produced more tea on my kitchen counter than in the pitcher. So, in the trash it went! I tried to adjust the machine several times to fix the leaking problem but then I quickly realized it was the poor design that was to blame. However, the two-quart iced tea design from Mr. Coffee with the round pitcher is a MUCH better option. I do not have any leaking or other problems with that machine."
1,Messy machine,I had an older tea maker by this company with a round pitcher and brewer that had worked wonderfully for several years. Sadly I lost the pitcher during a move and needed to buy a new tea maker. I picked up this which looked like a simple redesign of the old set. I went through three of these and each had the same problem. The first few times I'd brew a pot it would work wonderfully but then they all started leaking out all over the counter. The heat would warp some of the cheap inside components and instead of getting a nice flow into the pitcher it would spray all over and make a horrible mess. I would not recommend this set to anyone.
1,WORST TEA MAKER EVER!,"I bought the Mr. Coffee tea maker because I have a hard time making good tea without a machine. However, the Mr. Coffee Tea Maker is a waste of time. I use the exact amount of water according to their pre-marked pitcher and I use 3 small tea bags. The tea maker spills out on my countertop EVERY time. I would not recommend this tea maker to anyone and believe it to be a waste of your money!"
1,No yard sale find,Glad I only paid $5 at a yard sale for one that some newlyweds didn't want. It did exactly the same thing as everyone else has said. I went through a half roll of paper towels as it poured all onto the counter while brewing. That's when I checked the reviews so see others with the same experience! I had the old version with the blue lids for 15 years until the pitcher cracked. Glad I didn't pay $20 or more for this model! Will look for a different brand!
2,Stopped working,"I've had my tea maker for a couple of months now, and while I did experience an issue with leaking if I did not have the pitcher placed properly, my biggest disappointment is that the unit will not even turn after just a couple of months of light use. I loved the convenience of an iced tea maker but will not purchase another Mr. Coffee unit. I will be researching other brands to find one that is more reliable."
2,Plastic Tasting Tea,"I have the Mr. Coffee TM1 2 quart iced tea maker and have NOT been able to get a good tasting pitcher of tea yet. I have brewed at least 5 pitchers of tea, run only water 3 times, and called the water company out to check our water lines, and the tea still tastes like plastic. I am using Lipton tea. I don't know what else to do. I have the maker repackaged and ready to return. I love the concept of how fast the tea is made and it is not messy, but I am gladly going back to hot water on the stove to keep the good taste."
1,don't waste your money!,"Although it seams to work fine at first, it becomes junk quickley. I am on my 3rd Mr. Coffee iced tea maker, I have to exchange it about every 2 months because the pitcher keeps cracking and I have more tea on the counter than in my pitcher. When I use it the first few times it's always ok, but it never last more that 1 1/2 - 2 months before it makes a huge mess with every use."
1,Poor Design,Often encountered problems with the drain hole not properly lining up with the channel that poured the tea into the pitcher. Difficult pouring the tea from the pitcher due to its square design. Both problems led to quantities of tea on the floor. Do not buy!!!
1,don't waste your money or time,I purchased this item at Frys Food Store for $19.88. It makes tea ok but it spills all over the counter and the floor. Don't waste your money. Find a different Ice tea maker.
1,Ditto to all other reviews,The lid that doesn't fit and gets tea all over the floor. The fact that tea is down inside double layer pitcher but one more is the fact that after the tea cuts off you need to wait at least fifteen minutes before removing the tea pitcher from under the maker because thats how long it takes for all the tea to drain out of basket. Hot tea running down counters is not a pretty sight.
2,This has been redesigned.,"This product has been redesigned. The new model number is TM30P. The new pitcher is round, and pours easily. The lid is still a bit tight, but no problems so far. Got mine on sale for $17.94, including a second pitcher at a local retailer that begins with a W. ;)"
5,Very Good,I purchased this after my sun tea jar broke. I have used it twice and it is very easy to use. The tea comes out just like the sun tea. No more glass jars for me. It also has a special brewing for Iced Coffee.
1,Bad Design -- Tea Runs Everywhere,"I had the old Mr. Coffee tea maker years ago and it was delightful. 75% of the time I use this one, I have tea running all over the counter. For me, the tea is fine and the pitcher is fine. I would not purchase this model again though if this one dies. It's a pain in the neck."
2,Poorly Designed,"This is not the first iced tea maker that I have owned, but I have owned this particular model for close to 3 years, and despite it's reliability, it has some MAJOR design flaws. My biggest pet peeve is the fact that if I do not position the pitcher and the tea basket JUST RIGHT, it drains tea all over my countertop!!! If the tea basket isn't positioned perfectly, or the pitcher is even sitting at a slight angle on your countertop, then the tea doesn't drip into the pitcher. The only reason I didn't give this a negative star rating was because it is pretty reliable. If you love nothing more than to repeatedly bleach the tea stains from your countertops, then this particular model will be right up your alley."
2,They sent the wrong item.,"I have tried twice to get this item through Amazon. DO NOT TRY TO DO THIS.This is an out of stock, retired item.The sellers will send you the 3 quart Mr. Coffee Ice Tea Maker. It is an inferior product.Then you will have to request a refund, wait for them to send you a refund label, send it back, and then wait a week for the refund.Seriously, awesome ice tea maker. You cannot get this one through Amazon.com."
1,I did NOT get item ordered.,"Will never order from someone with anto(?) e-mail again from Amazon.Ordered TM1- 2 quart Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker and he sent a 2 qt iced tea maker that don't work. Drips when making and don't work, to much hassle to deal with."
2,Big Disappointment,"This is the third Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker we have owned. Wore the others out and loved them. This model is AWFUL!!!! No matter how careful I am pushing the pitcher up to the brewing unit, it leaks all over my counter, staining my countertop. Was hoping there was a recall on these so I could get a newer one that actually works right. The tea that does make it into the pitcher is good tho."
5,Bought to replace unit owned +10 years,"I had owned and used the Mr. Coffee ice tea maker for more than 10 years. When I broke it, I looked at the newer options in ice tea makers. In the end, I repurchased the same product and am very pleased."
4,Works As Expected,"I actually purchased this unit from the store for $20 about a month ago. I've used it every week since then and have yet to run into a hitch. The brewing unit and the pitcher are both made of lightweight plastic. In fact, I think the construction of the brewing unit is pretty flimsy if you ask me, but so far it hasn't created a problem. The latest model offers an automatic shut-off and a 3 quart capacity. I haven't had any problems with leaks as other users have reported. The brewing unit does tend to ""dribble"" after completing the brewing cycle, so just be sure to leave the pitcher in place until several minutes after it finishes. Other than that, it's worked like a charm."
1,buy something else!,"Terrible product. While brewing, the tea drips out of the brewer but not into the pitcher. Makes a mess all over the counter every time I use it. For the last time. Just threw the whole thing in the trash. Will replace it with another brand. Save yourself from cleaning up a tea-stained counter and skip this one."
1,Another leaker.,"Despite pretty rigorous alignment attempts before hitting the power, I still manage to dump a few quarts of tea on the counter every five or six times I use this. Tonight was the fourth time I've had to mop up tea, and the machine is going into the trash.I also agree with the complaints about the square pitcher. I strongly recommend against this model."
2,Pass on this one,"This was a Christmas gift for my two little ones who adore the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. I was so disappointed to see #1, that the paint job is shoddy. The paint had already rubbed off of Mickey's nose onto the packaging. And #2, Daisy, Donald and Mickey don't stand up at all and it's very hard to make Minnie stand up. The product picture is very deceiving. I'm really not impressed and had I known it, I wouldn't have purchased them.However, they are really cute and would be great as cake toppers as other reviewers have suggested. They just aren't good for regular playtime use."
4,Nice figures,"My daughter likes the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse TV program, so I wanted to get her a set of play figures like these. They are really cute and nicely representative of the famous Disney characters; plus, they seem durable. Not as costly as the talking ones, and they serve their purpose of imaginative play perfectly well."
2,Not Durable,I bought this for my twin toddlers for Christmas. Its January 4th and Donalds arm fell off and Goofy came unglued. His top half is now seperate from his bottom half. We also got the Toy Story set and they are still complete. They are really cute but not safe or durable. I'm dissapointed.
4,Kids LOVE it,They are just simple Disney figurines but they were a VERY good price than buying straight from Disney and my kids love them. They asked for a Mickey Mouse Clubhouse toy and the one Disney sold was $50 and only came with Mickey Mouse this has been just as good because they have all the characters and they take them everywhere- even play with them in the bath.
3,Not bad,"I bought this set for my daughter to go with the club house and she likes it quite a bit. They are simple figures, not interactive but she doesn't care. I bought the set directly from Disney for $12 (which is much less then Amazon sells it for). The only negative is that in the set we received Daisy can barely stand by herself; she keeps falling over unless she is leaning against something."
2,Not durable,"My 2 year old twins love anything Mickey Mouse- so I was not surprised when they picked this off the shelf. Within hours of opening the package, one of Donald Duck's arms fell off- becoming a dangerous choking hazard. A couple of days later, Minnie Mouse's nose broke off. Several of the characters do not stand up on their own- but my kids don't mind. They just love playing with their beloved characters. I am not recommending because they are cheaply made (made in China) and can quickly become a choking hazard."
1,This is a cheap replica!!! Not the original Disney Figurines,"I bought these to use as a cake topper. I usually buy them from the Disney Store, but they were out of stock, so I decided to buy them here. I've bought the originals many times before, and I can tell you these are a cheap, cheap replica. The paint job is terrible, it's all over the place, the paint seems to be of bad quality since it scrapes off easily, some of it was on the package already. It has different types of paint too, some parts are glossy while other parts are flat, and the skin color of Mickey & Minnie was light Orange, instead of flesh. Not to mention they are more than twice the price, the cost on the Disney Store is $8.00. Absolutely not worth it!!! I guess they would serve a better purpose as toys, but even then, parents would get a much better deal with the figurines on the Disney Store website."
4,Disney mickey mouse,"this is very pretty, my kids love this, i put this in him cake of birthday too,my kids always play with this 6 figure."
2,Amazon charges more for this collection than the Disney Store!,"I bought my set from the Disney Store for $12.50 (the normal D Store price). The annoying thing about them is that the characters don't stand up! It is so hard to get them to stand because they will just topple right over! My daughter will spend so much time trying to get them to stand on their feet but they just fall over every time. Maybe we got a bad set, but if they are all like this, I would not recommend this set."
5,2 year old son loves these characters!,"I bought these for my son's 2nd birthday originally just to go on his Mickey Mouse Clubhouse cake. After the party I gave them to him to play with and he absolutely loves them. They are just the right size for his little hands and he is able to make them stand up on his own (most of the time!) His 4 year old sister likes to ""share"" them with him, too!"
4,Perfect for birthday cake,"My daughter wanted a Mickey Mouse Clubhouse birthday cake. I didn't feel like making the characters, so I was thrilled to find this set of figures. These figures were perfect on her cake.I bought her the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse for a present. I already knew that these figures were not the interactive ones that go with the clubhouse, so I wasn't disappointed. My daughter enjoys playing with these figures along with her clubhouse.The figures are made in China, so if she was younger and still sticking things in her mouth, I might worry about that some."
2,They don't last very much,"I bought this for my toddler, he was very happy with the little figurines, but they don't last as much as I would expected, after a couple of weeks the Pluto figure had split in two, leaving two smaller pieces that could lead to a child choking on them, and the colors of some of the other figurines had rubbed off, I don't recommend them, look for something else."
2,So so,"I was disappointed by the seller because it appeared that the product's seal had been opened and the plastic was re-taped shut with SCOTCH TAPE. So, it did not seem to be a new product. Secondly, within the first few minutes of my child playing with the figurine, Donald Duck's hand just simply fell off and this was not a result of the item being played with aggressively. Poor product and the seller should not be scotch taping things shut that have obviously been opened and most likely used or played with..... I do not recommend buying from this seller."
1,Not compatible with club house,I was pretty disapointed when this arived. It is not really ompatible with the Mickey Mouse Club House. These are not the interactive figurines. I will be returning these if possible.
3,"Kinda cheap, but cute. Good for cake toppers.","I was a little disappointed when I received these figurines. They are smaller than they appeared to be, and the paint details are kinda shabby. Minnie has a big black spot on her face, and it looks like they colored out of the lines a little. My son loves them though, but he's only two so he doesn't know the value of good craftsmanship. I expected better quality from a Disney toy."
4,Good fun toy,This was a good fun toy. My nephew loved it. You need to buy the other Disney characters.
3,Great for a birthday cake!,"I used these for my daughter's first birthday cake and it turned out great! I'm not sure if a child would actually enjoy playing with them. I wouldn't let my daughter play with them once we took them off the cake, their noses are really tiny and could easily be chewed off."
3,pluto broke first day,"I don't know if we just received a bad one, but Pluto's back legs broke off at the waist the very first day my daughter (3 years old) got this. Even super glue didn't seem to stay. We ended up buying another set, which is cheaper at the Disney store.That said, she loves these figurines. I knew they didn't go with the clubhouse, so we did actually get her the figurines that go with the clubhouse. I don't know why they don't make Daisy for the clubhouse, so luckily this Daisy joins them on their adventures as well. What's great about these is that they are so much smaller than the clubhouse variety, and so they travel easier in the car and on the go."
1,Total disappointment,"How awful to order a product described as the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse figurines only to find on Christmas morning that they do not fit the Clubhouse. This is total false advertisement. So yes, the figures are fun to play with; however, don't waste your money if you think they are for the actual clubhouse."
5,Used as cake toppers!,"These were just what I needed for the Disney themed birthday cake for my twin grand-daughters. Looked too cute on the cake, they got to lick off the icing from Mickey's & Minnie's shoes....& then got to keep them for playtime!"
4,No frills and no complaints,"The title pretty much covers it. No spout screen to catch leaves, no fancy sure-loc lid, just a really cute, but not cutesy teapot in a stonewear material that looks like it will NOT break easily. A hard working everyday teapot in a bunch of cheery colors - what else could you want?"
2,Too small!,"I wish there had been info like ""this will give you two big mugs of tea"" or something. I clearly don't get ounces....this thing was so small, it's for one mug only. I returned it and there was no problem with return."
3,Smaller than what I realized.,It's nice - just really small. Great if you only want one or two cups.
5,Teapot,Nice teapot for personal use if you want more than one cup. I'd like to get one in aubergine to make a nice contrast with this one.
2,Mediocre Tea Pot,"This teapot is not the greatest. When pouring, it leaks and you end up with tea stains on your counter."
3,Poor Pouring.,"It's little, cute, and works for steeping the tea, but half the tea pours down the side of the teapot when I try to get it into my cup. If it had a better spout I would have considered getting another!"
3,Broke before I could wear it.,I liked this ring but it is too fragile to really wear. Mine came and within a couple of days broke. Now I have to try to find a way to fix it.
2,Rigid non-moving ring,"This ring is supposed to have three points of articulation. It does not. It is a rigid ring. If one were to move it as other armor rings do, the joints would tear apart. When the seller states it is solid pewter, that appears to refer to the lack of any ability to flex the ring.It does look nice and is unique, so I gave it two stars for appearance."
2,Dissapointing when compared to Joel's previous books,"The articles in this book are on the whole, not that interesting. There is no logical flow between subjects, or even style of resulting.Joel's contributions are minimal (a footnote here and there to expand an acronym or link to a webpage). The usual wit has been lost and his comments actually have an air of arrogance."
2,Would be better if Joel's ego didn't get in the way,"There really are some good essays in this book, though a few of them are a little boring, and a lot of them really don't have anything to do with software development.Joel's ego-driven introductions and blatantly obvious footnotes make me wonder what the intended audience for the book is."
1,BEWARE !!! SHIPS PAL NOT NTSC..FALSE ADVERTISING,THIS VENDOR ADVERTISES THAT THE DVD DISC IS NTSC...WRONG!!!..IT'S PAL AND WON'T PLAY ON MOST (U.S.) DVD PLAYERS..SHAME ON YOU.
3,"Dig, Dig, and Dig some more","I am definitly impressed by the simplicity, but more so, by thedigging power this guy has."
4,New Zealands premier rock band comes up trumps again,"Shihads new self titled album explodes the moment you put in the player, with 'Home Again'.' It is a simple, catchy song that immediately sets the tone for the rest of the album. Easily accessible rock tracks with grungey riffs and a distinct lack of guitar solos. This is Shihads third release, after the 1993 'Pantera-esque' release 'Churn', and the 1994 album 'Killjoy.' With 'Shihad,' the band takes a distinct turn from flat out hard rock and moves towards a more melodic side, like on 'Hate Boys,' 'Yr Head is a rock' and 'Leo Song', while still retaining that edge that has made them New Zealands best rock band for many years. Killer cuts off 'Shihad' are the rampaging 'La la Land' (an ode to Los Angeles), 'A Day Away,' possibly the best song Shihad has ever written, and the grind that is 'Ghost from the Past' Not an essential album for your C.D Collection, but a excellent buy. The 4 stars say it all. Awesome."
1,Dreadful!,"The production of this DVD is good, no problems there. However, the demonstrator doesn't inspire confidence in his abilities since he can frequently be seen teetering around showing poor balance, the gap between his rear heel and the floor is imperceptible suggesting its actually in contact with the floor, contrary to good practice and generally his performance looks no better than say, a new shodan of which there are many in my dojo! His actual grade is not mentioned just his 'long years training in Japan' where he is domicile. In frustration, I spent about three times as much on a Japanese made, 8th Dan Hanshi demonstrated DVD and viewing it confirmed my reservations about 'Complete Introduction to Muso Shinden Ryu Iaido'.Avoid this expensive DVD."
2,Questional Value for the Money,"Good DVD, but I did not feel it is worth the selling price. The DVD primarily concentrates on 12 basic striking movements starting from the seated position. There is a bonus feature from one of his seminars. This feature was helpful because he gives additional tips on the movements and points out common mistakes. I would have preferred sections of his live seminar edited into the main instructional section. One has to refer to both the seminar and the instructional section to gather all the information provided in the DVD."
3,good lens for the price,"if you are into professional photography this lens is not for you, I like the cheap price and for a cibershot camera you can have a lot of fun taking wide angle and macro shots."
4,12-Step program needed for this game! Very Addictive!,"RCT in general is awesome, but this expansion pack really goes a long way to furthering the fun of the original game. Just when you thought it couldn't be any better, they come up with this! The reasons why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 are simply because once you've installed the expansion pack, it won't play unless you have that cd in, the original RCT cd won't work any more. I also wish that they would include more ""Thrill Rides"". Other than that, it's awesome! My husband and I have to time each other so we can get on the computer and play this game! I think we've become official RCT junkies! I also love the design competitions. That really goes a LONG way towards making this a truly interactive game. So, for those others of you out there who also have ""God Complexes"", you have got to go and get this game and expansion pack! I'm definitely addicted and in need of a good 12 - Step program!"
4,"Great as a game, not as an expansion pack","I received original as a gift. Great sound, gameplay, and fun. Then when I installed this on it, gameplay wasn't that much enhanced. There no mode where its no worries about guests, ratings, or objectives, until you beat the game. All it really did is add like 5 new rollercaoster, 2 trill rides, 2 shops, and 2 gentle rides (numbers may be off but thats an estimate). and then it added around 30 new scenarios. So its really a good game, but it could have added more themes and attractions."
3,Great game but...,"This game wus really awesome in a way and really disapointing in a way. I loved it because it wus so addicting and it had music, abstract hypertrain carts and real parks. But one day i wus playing and it just crashed. i tried running it again and it said acception raised, access violation, gsk, or something. and on the origional it would not let me load saved games. i wus mad because all these bugs were messing it up. i had used a trg trainer(cheats) when i wus getting extra money in it and it crashed and started messing up and wouldnt quit. now i am searching into this right now.just way to many bugs..."
1,How to ruin an already great game,"Rollercoaster Tycoon was a good game except for the fact that they kept requiring the gamer to meet a stupid goal, instead of just designing a park to what they saw would fit the landscape. It could be enviromentally safe or not. Also they needed to allow design and testing and installing of new rides during the winter closing (Oct-Mar). Now with the Corkscrew Follies expansion pack they have gotten even worse by devalueing the park each month so you always have to keep building up the park to keep from letting they value of the park diminish. Haven't the designers of this game expansion heard of land value, or inflation, or even increased value of used rides, that can actually be sold for more than you originally paid for them. But formost on the list on how not to ruin what should be a fun game is forget the idea that there has to be some goal to shoot for and let the gamer JUST HAVE FUN! ."
4,One of the Best Simulated Games I've played!!,"In my opinion, if you are thinking of buying Corkscrew Follies, you should. I think it has good graphics and sounds. The game never gets boring! There are so many different types of rollercoasters and desings are unlimited. You could build the rollercoaster of your dreams!There could be a little more shops though, and different styles of bathrooms besides the same plain bathroom.The scenarios can be a little challenging I have found. I think the ones where you have to get x amount of people in your park before october year 3 or so on to complete is easier than having to get a park value of 17k by then.All in all, I think it is a pretty good game, I haven't played RCT2 so, all I know is that this is the best sim. game I've ever played!"
3,it's gettin better!!!,"there are a bunch of new add ons, and scenarios including the same form the older ones. U can also load older games into this one. I suggest getting loopy landscapes though. It has levels form the first one, this one, and new ones. There are even 3 (real parks) in which u can get up to 105 thousand dollars!!!!! U can also get things like exotic sea food shop, coffe, t-shirt, souveiner, and hat stalls!!!!! u should definetley get this than any sim theme park games or the first roller coaster tycoon Anyways i suggest gettin loopy lanscapes if u can"
3,Expansion pack not worth money,"I found that the expansion pack was not worth the money that I paid for it. It gives you new stuff, but unlike the original, it doesn't stay fun for as long. Please do not use this for the original. RCT #1 is wonderful."
5,Couldn't stop watching,"Season 2 of The Killing was a very suspenseful, on-the-edge-of-your-seat, action-packed season. It has a great storyline, & it is totally unpredictable. The main characters grew on me, & I found myself upset when they got into trouble, wondering how they're ever going to get out of the situation. I am sad that there is no Season 3, but I will keep watching for it & hoping."
5,Great show,"This is one of the best written shows on TV. Right up there with The Good Wife, Homeland, Boardwalk, etc."
5,Very interesting series.,The second season delves into the past that creates the depth of character for these terrrific actors. The plot gets slow at times but I was still engrossed.
