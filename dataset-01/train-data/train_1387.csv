3,How could You Miss these songs on this collection?,"Though this is a great compilation of songs, I was thinking about some of thoseduets that were not on this collection:1) With You I'm Born Again Billy Preston and Syreeta Wright2) My First Love Rene And Angela3) We Both Need Each Other Michael Henderson and Phyllis Hyman4) Nothing Ever Felt Like This Will Downing and Rachelle Ferrell"
4,Came out of the gate strong...,"I thought enough of Mark Dever's book to use it as a template for a series of lectures in an adult Sunday School setting. The first chapters of Mark's book are especially insightful and clearly illuminate perhaps the most critical needs of the modern church.Numerous evangelical parishioners have never heard a solid expositional sermon (mark number one). Most pastors do not know what an expositional sermon is and therefore have never preached one. The congregants in our churches starve for the meat of the Word of God.The fourth ""mark"" is especially challenging for contemporary evangelicals. What is ""conversion"" from a biblical perspective? Many problems in our churches can (and should) be attributed to the unconverted in who occupy not only pews on Sunday morning but also seats on the elder board.I wish that Mark had done as thorough a job on the later ""marks"" as he did on the earlier ones."
5,kinlde,great and much appreciated. It met my expectations and the item was what I ordered and received very timely and thank you
5,Nine Marks of a Healthy Church,"The writing style of the author is simple and straight forward making this book an easy read. In a day when many people are searching for strong churches based solely on the Word of God, this book provides guidelines to help in that search. This book also provides a basis of examining where the church is that you are serving in presently in comparison to the Word of God. The purpose of the church is explained through the use of the Scriptures. When one sees the purpose of the church then you can clearly recognize churches that are on track in fulfilling their role in the lives of believers. In addition, we then see what we are to be focussing on as individual believers.I would encourage every believer in the Lord Jesus Christ to read this book as it will challenge you in your walk with the Lord in light of His Word."
5,Helpful Book,"This book was very good, I had not thought a lot about what this book talks about and this book help raise my awareness of some very important issues. This is a great read for anyone. If you are looking for are looking for a new church I would take a look at this book, and let it help you with your search. Preachers need to read this and try to have a church that emulates much of this book. Really a good book."
2,You may want to borrow it before you buy...,"This is a prescriptive work aimed at helping church leaders focus on the right things. As with any prescriptive work, how helpful the book is depends on where YOU are coming from. If you are coming from the same place as the author (white suburban/rural America) then I think this is a helpful book with important insights!If you come from an Urban area or a very multiethnic/multicultural city, then you should probably read critically, and with extra care. The author's use of the word ""culture"" is broad and, in some senses, a bit uninformed.The chapters are a series of topical sermons (even the chapter on the importance of expositional sermons!). This is a format I don't particularly care for (unless the author is someone like D.M. Lloyd-Jones).Toward the end of the book it becomes clear that what the author is advocating is not so much the antithesis to church growth theology, but more of a wholistic model for church growth (ala Orlando Costas)."
1,"""horrible strongest smell""","If you have some respect for your nose, please don't buy these wipes!!! I bought these thinking that maybe it would have a nice soft smell, but these thing has more than enough perfume to stink your whole house!!! and I would never put it on the delicate skin of my baby!"
2,SMELLLLY!,"These wipes have more perfume in them than any wipe on earth. They are about the same softness as the Kirkland brand, but cost a lot more. And wooohoooo, they smell stronger than este lauder herself."
3,meh,Maybe my tastebuds are different but I bought this at a local healthfood store and I'm not completely sold on it. I tried it in my tea and it did leave me w/ an aftertaste...just like most sweetners. *shrugs*
5,Love this stuff- So much I ordered again,"This stevia is perfect. It's so sweet you only need a little bit, so the cannister lasts a long time. Tastes great, no aftertaste."
5,Excellent,This stevia is great. I use it in smoothies and to make lemonade. I've tried other brands and always come back to this one. I do not notice any aftertaste.
5,Best stevia product I ever used,"I used to buy this product in this size at a health food store in Florida for 27 dollars. Where I moved to in NY I could not find it in the stores so I looked online. With shipping costs, it still cost under 20 dollars.I use this product in tea and coffee and I like it better than real sugar. I don't find it bitter at all even when I accidently put a little too much in ice tea. Sometimes I forget it's not real sugar when it's in ice tea. I especially like that it has no other additives for texture or taste. I have used it in baking simple pound cakes and cookies and they were good."
1,used to be my favorite,"This was my favorite stevia product and I had it on subscribe and save until I queried customer service about NuNaturals GMO use. Yes, NuNaturals uses GMO products. SO, I've canceled my subscribe and save order and am now usingStevita Stevia Clear Liquid Extract, 3.3-Ounce Container (Pack of 3)."
5,Sweet stuff!,"I was quite skeptical about stevia at first, but tried it with another brand and thought there wasn't much difference in taste and I felt better about using a more natural product than the other artificial sweeteners out there. I then started looking at getting a bulk container and happened upon this product. I now have purchased this same product 4 times and am quite pleased. The product is a bit more concentrated and we are using less of the product in our drinks and cooking than other competitors.The deliveries are always quick and we have not had any issues at all with the product or packaging."
3,not the breadbox in the picture,"I ordered this Brabantia Medium Matte Steel Fingerprint Proof Roll Top Breadbox and it was delivered right away. However, the one that I received was not the breadbox that is pictured, it has rounded steel sides and is not black on the sides and bottom. Nowhere did it have the Brabantia name trademark and the box that it came in was from another company. Two weeks later I saw the breadbox that I received in a mail-order catalog for kitchen gadgets and supplies, and it was clearly the pictured one exactly the same as the one that I received, FOR $19.99!!!!!!! Clearly not the price I paid for it! So, I learned a valuable lesson..."
4,Brilliant Stainless,"This is a nice bread box, but it is NOT brushed stainless as one reviewer said. I was counting on that since the description wasn't specific about the finish. Instead I received a ""Brilliant Stainless"" bread box. Since everything else in my kitchen is brushed stainless I wanted to return it, but the company felt that it was my mistake for ordering the wrong item so I would have to pay the return shipping (the best price I found was $24) and also a 20% restocking fee. I decided it was not worth it and kept it. They offered me a 10% discount on a new one in the finish I wanted. If you want a bright, mirror finish, this is a nice bread box. I gave it 4 stars because it is a good bread box, but I can't give it 5 stars because the description isn't accurate enough."
5,Yes NO fingerprints,yes this is a gret breadbox not only is it fingerprint proof but it comes in a nice big size and it is matted inside for a different feel. I was very impressed when I received this it makes the kitchen pop.
2,Looks good but rusts,"We first got one of these as a gift and loved the way it looked. Outside is very nice. Looks good on the counter. Somewhat low profile but ample room inside. Nice rubber mat liner inside. But it rusted. We liked to way it looked so much we bought a second one. And that one rusted, too. Which is too bad because it is exactly what we want looks-wise and I thought stainless steel was not supposed to rust. In a weird way I would recommend it. But be prepared for rust."
2,roll top bread box,"For a bread box that was almost $50, I am very disappointed in how light it is in weight. To me, it is flimsy, and even with 2 loaves of bread in it, it slides around on the counter. It is very pretty, I will say that. But I expect more for my $50 and from Brabantia. I am sorry to return it, after spending hours doing research and reading reviews.....maybe there isn't a bread box out there that is the quality I expect."
3,Bread Box,"Looks pretty, however, I anticipated that it would prolong the life of my bread products. Not!"
1,Brabantia Roll Top Bread Bin - Poor Quality,"the product is not strong or sturdy, it is flimsy and tinny - and so not worth the money really."
4,Would be great if it didn't arrive dented,"This breadbox would have been perfect for my kitchen counter - it holds a lot, and the low profile allows for storage of items on top of it. The weight isn't heavy but it's more than adequate for my kitchen (i.e., I don't have any pets that like to explore what's on the counters and knock things off). But, I was very disappointed to take it out of the package to find Rrlandis sold damaged goods. The roll top had a dent in the front of it. That's very poor quality control on this seller's part. It's a waste of buyers' time to order something, receive it damaged, and then have to make a trip to UPS to drop it off. I think from now on when it comes to anything stainless/storage containers, I'd best go to a brick and mortar store to ensure I'm getting what I pay for."
3,Nice breadbox with caveats,"My breadbox arrived with a dimple in the top. I didn't want the hassle of returning it so I a kept it. After about 8 months the roll top would no longer latch. It was then I noticed that this fairly expensive device was held shut by 2 tiny pieces of plastic, one of which was now lying in the breadbox. I found a site for warranty return but it asked if the item was under warranty. I had no idea what the warranty on this thing was and I couldn't find an answer on line, so I checked yes. A few days later I got an email saying the broken latch would be replaced. A few weeks later I got a small package from Belgium with the replacement latch. What happens the next time this thing breaks (and it is designed to break) I don't know. Like the title says, it looks nice, but."
5,Very pleased...,"I shopped around before selecting this bread box. I read many bad reviews about dented and cheap boxes, this one was more expensive, but it had so many good reviews I felt comfortable ordering it. When it arrived it was in in perfect condition, I am giving this as a gift to my sister who has the matte stainless steel appliances so I know she is going to love this!"
5,Roll Top Bread Bin Finish: Matt Steel,"Nice shape, holds two loaves of bread and room for small items on top; Roll top works well; Attractive appearance with black trim complimenting the silverish appearance. Was better than expected from picture."
3,Nice dented box,This is a nice breadbox espcially if you have a low space to hold it. Unfortunately it arrived with a slight dent. The packaging is not very good so it is very easy to have it arrive with a dent. I would not recommend it on this basis
2,Horrible packaging and missing parts!!!!,"Very disappointed in this product and the company. When the bread box arrived it was dented because of the horrible packaging. It was in a thin cardboard box with no protection in the inside to keep it from getting damaged. The top of the box is supposed to have screws but, one of those was missing so the roll up door wouldn't open. I was very disappointed with this product and would not order from this company again."
3,Not perfect,Ordered this from Hold N Storage and received the bread box with what seemed to be wear marks on the front of the door along with three small scratches. Returned it and ordered another from another seller. This time no wear marks but the door is a little wobblely. I kept this one and it is large and what I wanted. Looks good and matches my matte stainless steel refrigerator and coffee maker. But it seems that the ones I ordered may have been used. Can't say for sure. They are not perfect.
1,No protection in OEM Packaging at all... each one ordered was damaged!,"I found this delicate Kitchen item to be exactly what I was looking for. However, it was damaged even BEFORE Amazon placed in their shipping box. Barbantia goes to no effort at all to protect these very delicate items in their original manufacturer's packaging. I know this as my second attempt to order this item was shipped by Amazon with NO SHIPPING BOX AT ALL and was fully destroyed AFTER I paid 50% more to replace the first damaged item before Christmas. TERRIBLE original packaging and TERRIBLE fulfillment effort! These items should never be sold via delivery service and should remain ""In Store only!"""
5,Better than expected,I was in the market for a stainless steel breadbox that fit into a newly remodled kitchen and this looks and feels perfect. Very smooth operation with a clean and crisp appearance that definitely does not look cheap. What more could you want in a bread box? And it was neither bigger nor smaller than a breadbox.
2,A Giant Sized Disappointment,The same book written in english (The BFG by Dahl) is humorous and adventurous. The translation into spanish makes the book difficult to read and sometimes hard to follow. The giant speaks in a different dialect which tends to distract the reader/listener. When this dialect is used in the spanish version the names of the giants are difficult to pronounce. I began reading it to my bilingual third graders aloud in english and then switched to spanish thinking that it would be easier for them to understand and relate to. This wasn't the case. The spanish version is probably a better read for children 10 and up.
5,This has it all,"Some of the greatest songs ever written. I mean, ""Memphis women and chicken"" - doesn't that say it all? And, ""Dark End of the Street"" - if that song cut any deeper, you'd have to have a transfusion to listen to it...Beautiful, spare versions by the songwriters - it doesn't get any more heartfelt and direct.And, if ""Old Folks"" doesn't make you a little misty, you should check your ticker - it might be missing."
4,Pennmanship,"Like Jimmy Webb, Dan Penn will never get the credit he deserves. But unlike Webb, Penn's are the best interpretations of his own songs. This is in part because he sings like David Hidalgo. But unfortunately R&B; writers of his era were confined to Tin Pan Alley songsmithing--even after rock went through its singer-songwriter era, when writing and performing merged. If not for this, Penn might have been the soul version of Dylan. Rather than feel bad for him, think how tough it must have been for the singer listening to his demos with an ear toward re-recording them. Final versions are canned and dispassionate compared to Penn's.This live album is played on two instruments, so it's mellow. For more fleshed-out versions, buy ""Do Right Man."" Both are great--especially for dinner parties and good-vibe evenings at home."
5,Soul music's jukebox treasure,"These songwriter-singers (it's reversed in their case) have written for or been covered by Aretha Franklin, Percy Sledge, The Box Tops, James Carr, Otis Redding, Janis Joplin, James and Bobby Purify... and the list goes on. Find out what these folks saw in this songwriting team. The record comes across as a new genre: Soul-folk or, better, acoustic soul, with the emphasis on soulfulness. Accompaniments are modest (acoustic guitar and keyboards), and the effect is as warm and intimate as the writing. If you like any of the above listed performers or recognize and like the songs, you'll probably love this CD. Other similar music that, if you like it, might mean you like this: Dylan of Nashville Skyline or Blood on the Tracks periods, Van Morrison, Al Green, The Beatles' most gentle tracks from Help!, Rubber Soul, [added: Revolver], the White Album, Let It Be or Abby Road, Niel Young from Harvest or Comes a Time, and maybe Carol King from Tapestry. Enough said. --mbazin"
5,I See Dead People ......,"Sweet little coloring book best suited for kids with markers rather than crayons, due to fine spacing on some of the pictures. I see very few viking stereotypes here, and the degree of historical accuracy a coloring book can be expected to deliver. If you and your kids can handle a few priests and villagers getting whacked and want to see vikings being vikings, this will be a fun book to add color to. };>{>"
4,Fun game,I enjoyed playing this game. I believe it to be fun. Like one on one shooting it out. Not your everyday type of game.
4,Great nostalgia value!,"If you were a video game fan in the 80s, you must remember this one. It was probably American LaserGames' most popular title.But much like the recent revival of Dragon's Lair, this game will not likely impress the current generation of gamers. The action is very slow compared to more modern gun games like House of the Dead 2. And full-motion, live-action video just isn't the visual wonder it once was.Nonetheless, for those of us who remember gawking at this game in the arcades, and who are fixin' to mosey on down memory lane, the CD-ROM version of Mad Doc McCree (best played with the Act-Labs PC USB light gun) is well worth the price. The video quality is really nice, and the game play is exactly as I remember it."
5,my opinion of the book,"I loved this book and would like to read more of the bobbsey twins, so... I am always looking for the books, in hardcover!I have a copy of this book, hardcover printed in 1962 and I love the book Angel"
2,"A Cash-in -- Nothing More, Nothing Less","If the first thing you think of when the words 'in-depth' are raised is Circus or Hit Parader magazines, you may find this book of interest. Basically, Whiplash is a compilation of quotes from the aforementioned magazines (as well as a few others) with a basic generic history of the band up to the ...And Justice For All period. Nothing new here, and no great insights. Lots of full-page photos, but not much else to recommend."
5,Moving,"Marie Berger's book is very revealing, giving people a further insight into haemophilia. Bringing up her son with haemophilia and four other children is understandably difficult. This is an enjoyable read for everyone and is very informative for those affected by haemophilia."
4,"Kinda lean, but interesting approach","This book is pretty short but it covers its content well. I think it's important for people to realize this book's intended audience--IT managers, DBAs, business people. It's not for people who want to learn XML. The book covers how XML can work in a corporate environment. For example, it talks about different XML tools in the software market and how XML is approached from different programming languages. Very topical.I recommend this book if you *aren't* interested in learning XML outright but instead want to figure out what it does."
2,Scatterbrained,"This book was miserable, and I gave it 2 stars to be polite. The author does not clearly explain XML. I was looking for a book that I could pass off to my staff to help bring them up to speed, and unfortunately this is not it. The author boldly states that the majority of his XML experience is through using Microsoft's XML parser, and the bulk of his examples are Microsoft centric, with a lot of example code in VBScript. His book touches on numerous ways in which other vendors have utilized XML, but does not focus on solid examples of how XML can be used in enterprise applications. The book is extremely short, and is certainly not worth the high price charged."
1,Disappointed to find that the OS backup DVD's are missing in my new Macbook Pro received,"It's quite disappointing that the black pack which carries the manuals, cleaning cloth and the MacOS DVD's doesn't have the DVD's in it on my new Macbook Pro purchased :(Amazon, please send me the original DVD's ASAP"
2,Battery does not charge,"Dead on arrival laptop - As soon as I powered on my new laptop for the 1st time , the battery icon said ""replace now"". After next boot said ""not installed"" and finally ""not charging"". Called apple support and they asked me to reset the SMC, which didnt solve the problem. SO they asked me to get a replacement. Before that, I Googled for issues on this new laptop and found many issues related to battery, the new graphic card and hard freeze, so decided to return this laptop instead of getting a replacement. Didn't want to be stressed out after paying 2000$ for a laptop. Would prefer a high end viao instead for 65% of the price. I think with the many design changes that happened year: new intel chip, new graphic card, apple has some design issues like the antennagate issue."
2,Great Laptop with Major OS Flaws,"First off I love my Macbook because it provides more stability than my windows machines. For professional work it can't be beat as of this moment. Although it is more stable than my windows machines it still freezes, on average, twice a month. So it is not invincible like some fanboys would want you to believe.Let me get to why I gave it a 2 out of 5 stars. WPA/WPA2 support is finnicky AT BEST. DUAL MONITOR support is wonky, unreliable and ultimately useless. Not addressing WPA issues is just ridiculous considering that it is something that can be fixed easily and why tout a miniport display that performs so poorly?Everything else seems to work pretty well. I hope to update this review as soon as these problems are resolved."
1,Disappointed,"Computer did not survive one day with my 12 year old daughter without needing $700 in repairs. Design has some basic durability faults. Key board is wide open to liquids, dust, contaminates which could quickly destroy it. Plastic keyboard covers could cause overheating."
4,The latest MacBook Pro is amazing!,Same slim shape as the previous MacBook pros; but the speed is incredible. Awesome with sound and video editing.Only problem I still have with MacBooks is that they have too few USB ports for users with printers/scanners/external hardrives etc.
4,A great deal,"It's used, so it can't be perfect as a new one, but considering the price of a used one and a new one, I chose the used one."
3,not what i thought,"the only one thing that I really like was that when I took the laptop out side it was easy to read,now as a PC guy always wanted an apple my skills in a mac are near to none but the apple company tech support was not to helpful at all,some were not to friendley and also hope you need tech support before 6 pm eastern time becuase they close at 6 pm,also it became very hard to play games when u need to right click a guy at the game room told me to used the arrows ( yeah sure) also some programs were not compatible or really difficult to down load well as for me I sold this apple and went back to my PC witch was more cheaper with a lot better power under the hood."
3,What a wonderful lapto.. What?!,"Well, since it says ""How do you rate this item"", I would give it a 5 star - Just for the sake of this laptop.But no. I'm, uhm, slightly disappointed.Where should I start? Disregarding the usefulness of this MacBook Pro, I'm currently having a little problem with it. Don't get me wrong, I fell in love with it right away (and I was a PC user until today.) Everything seems so enjoyable and delightful... And suddenly the number 4 key dropped off.Imagine one of those ""WTF!"" moments. Yes, you know what I mean.I have only been using this MBP for no more than 5 hours since I got it this morning, and this key fell off. Now I'm starting to wonder would the rest do the same, or should I just get an external keyboard? I saved almost 70 bucks buying this laptop on Amazon, and if I use this much money to get some instant glues, I can get more than a dozen.(Instant glue helps, trust me..)Now I'm going to talk to the Apple Support... And let's see what they say."
1,Don't Buy This,"I bought this computer for my son in March. For a week it worked fine, then it hung. Apple support is totally unable to fix it. Beware Apple hype about their products and, particularly, their ridiculous support.Apple MacBook Pro MB133LL/A 15.4-inch Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 200 GB Hard Drive, DVD/CD SuperDrive)"
4,Great Package/ So So quality!,"I just Received The 15' Mac Book Pro which was nicely expedited over the next day. The Condition of the Mac was Fair with some scratches here and there, also bumps. Macs Make great Hardware so the dings outside the Mac were ignore-able after it compensated by all the nice expensive software inside... Like Microsoft Word for Mac, Adobe Acrobat PRO which is neat... and will enjoy the Mac Until I upgrade with a Next Gen Mac Book Pro over-all I like it."
5,fabulous kids' stories and songs,"I remember listening to this with my brother long ago and it sending us into hysterics! Peter and Bill weave a spell of stories, songs, and general craziness and poignancy through their stay in the hospital for, respectively, echo-echo-lalia and appendicitis. A great dream sequence by Bill (from when he was knocked our on the operating table) is especially memorable, as is the tale of Peggy the four-legged octopus who is teased a lot for her disability. Sigh. Wonderful kid's media- wish they made more like this these days."
4,Excellent Book but...,I rarely have time to read books but have listened to many books on CD. I thought the story was riveting and well told. My only complaint was I think the audio version should have been read by a professional narrator. Many books are read by the author and few authors are good at reading their stories. I suppose there's some realism in the fact that she actually experienced the story but her voice sounds mostly flat and unengaging while the actual words being read are quite compelling.
1,Not a great book,"This is a sailing story written many years after the event occurred. The attempts by the author to recreate the scenario and her thoughts during this terrible ordeal seem awkward.It was a terrible life event for her, I'm sure, and writing may be therapeutic for her, but this book is a stretch. There are too many great writers and great sailing stories out there that this one is a waste of time."
4,Broad appeal,"I met the author on a taxi ride from providence, RI, to Newport, RI. My wife sent me the book for Christmas, and I read it in one sitting. She speaks of the sea and sailing without being too ""yachty"", and speaks of faith and love and hope without being cloying or sappy. Certainly not a ""Popular Mechanics"" account of survival, this is an excellent story, and well written. Highly recommended."
5,a great state of mind,"The sound track of OKLAHOMA!!!! IS by far my most favorite sound track. It is just awesome. I enjoyed hearing the music as a young boy, and I enjoy the movie still to this very day. I never knew that Rod Steiger who played ""Judd Fry"" was a singer. Shirley Jones was a TERRIFFIC SINGER IN THE MOVIE. IT IS A SHAME, that her singing talents were'nt showcased more in ""The Partridge Family"". If any one is looking for a sound track that has music with a beat, a ""slow"" beat, a feel good song or two, then I highly recommend ""OKLAHOMA!"". I don't think you'll be disappointed."
5,Just like watching the movie in my head!,"I LOVE this CD. It is just like I am sitting in front of the movie screen watching it with my eyes closed! For those of us who Love watching the song and dance numbers, I can picture it all in my head over and over again as I drive to work listening to it. It is a marvelous recording with all my favorite songs being sung by the stars that made this movie so great! SUPER fun to listen to!"
2,Disappointing sound quality on a classic soundtrack,"Like many people I guess, I bought this CD to replace my Capital vinyl LP of this wonderful Gordon MacRae/Shirley Jones classic. Being somewhat of a perfectionist I was looking forward to hearing the much loved tracks with new clarity and free from the cracks and pops of vinyl. Oh dear! I didn't take more than a few seconds listening to realise that something was wrong. The sound quality that was there on the vinyl has been lost in this digital remaster. I can best describe the problem as a severe loss of high frequency response which is so profound that the letter ""s"" sounds like ""f"" or is lost altogether. eg When Shirly Jones sings ""People will say we're in love"" it sounds like ""People will ay we're in love"" What a disappointment. I can't really believe that such a masterpiece has been so treated in remastering."
3,Lonely Room?,"This recording deserves 4 stars for the songs that are here, and five stars without the annoying added bits, but I'm giving it 3 for the song that isn't here - ""Lonely Room"". This song adds dimension to ""Oklahoma"" by transforming Judd from a villain into a sad and troubled man. When performed well it is an absolutely gorgeous piece of music. ""Lonely Room"" is my favorite song from the show and I can't understand why it was left out of the movie and thereby this recording."
4,A definitive movie recording,"A very complete recording of the strong performances from the original 1950's movie. All the dances are recorded here, especially hard to find ones (Kansas City, Many a New Day and All or Nothing). You will be disappointed if you are expecting this recording to match the broadway score. None of the dances match the score and are arranged (predictably) to fit on the screen, not stage. The bonus LP Overture is the closest rendition to the original score. For Oklahoma! fans, this recording is a collector CD, especially because it has so many bonus recordings."
5,"Oh, what a beautiful sound!",Oklahoma has never sounded better as sung by Gordon MacRae and Shirley Jones in the 1955 movie version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's unforgettable Broadway musical. The memory of MacRae's beautiful voice lives on with this CD. I never tire of hearing this wonderful music. From the opening overture to the finale you will feel as though you're right in the theater.
5,Great Soundtrack,"This is a really enjoyable cd. The tracks are great and I enjoy hearing the actors' dialogue through some of the songs. I have my own and have given this as a gift to my sister, who has a long commute to work. She also enjoys this cd, especially since it has tracks not included on another version of the Oklahoma! soundtrack which she had already. Also included is a small booklet with information about the making of the movie. As an unexpected bonus, my four-year-old daughter loves listening and dancing to the music now; one day, when her attention span is longer, I hope she will enjoy watching the movie just as much."
4,It was like sitting in the front row of the musical.,This soundtrack was just like the movie. If you enjoyed watching the production on film you will definitely enjoy this CD. There have been several other releases with different casts but this one was the one that most of us have probably seen and heard!
4,Ska-Punk at its finest,The use of heavy punk lyrics and music is enforced by the trumpet stylings and brass sound. This is almost a harder version of such bands as The Mighty Bosstones and Skaovie and the Epitones.
2,Really quite bad,"I bought this cd after listening to ""Pray for Mojo,"" one of the better ska cd's I own. I remember reading in the lyric sheet of ""Pray for Mojo"" one of the members thanking the fans who have stuck by them even when they played 'real bad ska.' Well, apparently this was still at a point in their career when they played real bad ska. Unlike ""Pray for Mojo"" which is filled with awesome hooks and harmonies, this album is full of mediocre songs with real bad singing. The singer definitely hadn't found his voice yet, and really sounds like he is joking around, which to a certain extent, he is. This is definitely before Mustard Plug became a good ska band. I would not recommend this cd to anybody except for truly die hard ""terrible ska"" fans."
1,there are better books,"Except for the discussion of sensory details, this book is too vague to be useful for beginning writers. There are better books, such as Dibell's ""Plot."""
5,Dowco 51223-00 Guardian WeatherAll Plus Black Motorcycle Cover for Cruisers,"GOT THIS COVER FOR MY 08 HARLEY DYNA STREET BOB. IT FITS GREAT AND AMAZON HAD THE BEST PRICE AVAILABLE. I DON'T LEAVE MY BIKE OUTSIDE MUCH EXCEPT ON WEEKEND WHEN WE TRAVEL TO OUR TRAILER AT LAKE ERIE. THIS IS A WELL MAKE COVER THAT I TRUST TO KEEP MY BIKE DRY. WELL WORTH THE MONEY TO BE SATISFIED & NOT HAVE TO WORRY. THANKS, BOBBY"
4,GOOD LOCK,"the lock is pretty solid. the key hole cover and lighted key are a plus. bike hasnt been stolen yet :) knock on wood. good price as well, cant complain..."
2,Disapointed,I thought the quality of the cover was really good. I was just disapointed that the ad on Amazon displays an elastic shock cord that does not come with the cover.
2,Disappointing,"I was reluctant to read this book because I didn't enjoy the first installment of the trilogy much. Wow, how right I was!!!Since I first read the story by Beroul, in High School, many, many years ago, I loved it. So beautiful yet so tragic. Cross-stared lovers in the resemblance of Romeo and Juliette. How magnificent!But I have never read of a sadder Tristan, even to the point of being ridiculous, and taking this book into account, I wonder how Tristan and Isolde and their love story have made it through time."
2,It used to be a great calendar...,The Futurama calendar is the ONLY one I made an effort to get every year.With it's interesting dates and original artwork it was head and shoulders above the rest.The 2007 calendar is now a lot like the others with recycled pics from it's TV series.What happened to the fresh art? I can't recommend this.Hopefully next year's will be better and get back to the new artwork.
4,Good display light,"This light did what I wanted it to. It's good for displaying glass objects and the motor is relatively quiet. I like that it spins as the lights flash, although it would have been nice to have more control over which colors lit up. However, it does have a nice set of defaults. Overall, it's a versatile piece that's great for illuminating small glass objects in any space necessary."
3,Tricky triumphs,"3 1/2If not as wholly compelling as their best, still certainly an undeniable entry from one of progressive rock's purest purveyors."
2,"Ah, the French...","Well? What's so great about this band? Or about Christian Vander's drumming?? He's actually boring and kind of sloppy here. There are some nice moments in the later tracks but the first half of the album is too repetitive and uninteresting. This is supposed to hearken to Coltrane? Coltrane, I thinnk, sometimes erred on the side of too much improvisation to the loss of respect for a song's melody. Not the case here. Magma is simply nowhere near as talented as their countrymen Art Zoyd, who are truly incredible -- find their stuff if you can! You need it more than this, when Magma were supposedly at their height (Attahk is better)."
4,Good for beginners,"This book does a pretty good job at helping the inexperinced sushi chef, particularly with getting the rice correct. I agree with the other reviewer - it would have been nice to know more about making eel. Another downside is the poor illustrations and limited instructions for actually forming the rolls, but other than that I would recommend it for someone starting out because it comes with the basic tools you need. It is a good kit, especially for the price."
5,Sushi made easy,Great book for those that want to make their own sushi at home. Recipes easily explained. Makes a great gift too
4,Not a bad book,"...My main reason for purchasing this book are the accessories that come with it. When I initially read through it I found it to be somewhat disorganized. But for the price you pay, and all that comes with the package, it's a good deal."
5,Black Culture and Black Consciousness Book,This book was decent. Took a little while to ship at home but worth the price! I needed this book for my anthropology class and its in excellent condition. Thank you very much!
2,Same Lame Old Stuff,"I got this and Gay Happenings Vol 7. The majority of the songs are short, and they are the same ones that have been around for a while now. Nothing fresh, nothing to warrant wasting $20 on the same stuff that is on the discount rack in the store."
1,The Worst Book on Lanyard Ever,"""Boondoggle"" is the worst book on Lanyard that I have ever seen. What really surprises me though, is that the books from Klutz are usually very high quality and have super clear instructions. This book is DEFINITELY an exception. There are only a few projects in the whole book,and there are ZERO that are fun or even look cool when there finished. The worst part was the directions. Klutz books all pride themselves on super clear instructions,but this book is definitely a failure. Look somewhere else,or you will be completely disappointed."
2,Not for Klutzes,"I normally love Klutz Press books, but this one was a disappointment. My daughter and I tried repeatedly to follow the instructions, and had no success. Someone less klutzy in the craft arena might enjoy this book, but it was hopeless for us."
2,close,Klutz strike again only they miss. I expected clear instructios that even I could follow. I have notmade one thing only half a dozen messed up beginings. Sorry Klutzes won't learn hear.
3,good for interested beginers,"it was as all other books on runes, or most of them. A bit of history and a bit of magic. not too bad."
2,Good for what I bought it for,Cheap quality and probably won't last long in the kitchen. But I'm not using it there. I'm using it to pick up hard to scoop pieces of dog poop on the side of my house where they drop dukies.
2,False Information,"This item is pictured in the advertisement as a sink strainer with a lid. When I recieved the strainer only I called Amazon.com and spoke to a representative. They brought up the advertisement and told me I must have recieved the wrong item since the lid was clearly shown in the picture and it should have been included. When the replacement order arrived it was the exact same item I had recieved before - one strainer, no lid. That is not what I had ordered. I returned this item for the second time and I am still searching for a stainless sink strainer with a lid!"
5,Corner Sink Strainer- Use every day,Ordered 2 corner sink strainers. Years ago was ableto purchase the strainers in our local stores but as theyears past I could no longer find these strainersuntil I checked Amazon. I do not have a garage disposal for the vegetable peelings. I use this strainer as I prepare meals every day. Helps keep thepeelings from going down the sink and when finishedjust put in trash. It is a must in my kitchen sincewe eat alot of salads and vegetables. Thanks Amazon
3,Sink drainer,It collects garbage as it should - nothing else to add - these reviews are not worth the time and effort to complete. If you are buying a sink strainer you would not read a review first.
4,HANDY KITCHEN ITEM,"One of my all time favorite kitchen items. I give this to my friends as a kitchen set along with a good small knife, a wide-mouthed funnel and a bottle opener. The strainer fits in the corner of the sink; catches clean vegetables or peelings for garden mulch. I have purchased at least a dozen and always have extras in my gift closet."
3,Poor quality,"I purchased a similar strainer last year, and it was a heavier gauge metal and had heavy rubber ""feet"" that kept it raised out of the sink so that water could flow under it. This one is very light weight, and has no feet - only indentations punched from the inside of each corner. It works okay, but last year's was better quality."
3,Correction to previous review,"After talking to the supplier, I realized my mistake. It is exactly what it claims ""a body"" or shell for an r/c."
3,Introductory Book,"First off, I must be clear. I am a terrible go player. I have been playing for about six months; however, I found this book to be very easy. There are countless problems on how to complete an atari or put your opponent in atari. Nevertheless, a couple of problems here and there tricked me so buying the book wasn't a complete waste. If you are completely new to the game then get this book. If you have been playing for a while, you are undoubtedly better than I and should order book 2 which I am eagerly awaiting."
2,amateur go player,"Most people seem to recommend Volumes 2, 3, and 4 (especially 3 and 4) of this series. Volume 1 is too easy.Amazon apparently does not carry anything except Volume 1, but all of the volumes can be ordered online from Kiseido. If you are interested in this book, also consider Get Strong at Tesuji and One Thousand and One Life-and-Death Problems. Check out David Carlton's internet go bibliography for more info."
2,"THIS SHOULD BE CALLED ""DISSASSEMBLE THEN STORE""","We already have the Endless Adventure Easy Store Table and love it! This table, however, is a giant pain. Putting it together is a hassle and who is going to want to take out the bolts every time they want to fold up the table?! We also had to drill out two of the holes during assembly. Would love to return it but my daughter threw out the box. You also need to be careful to distribute the children's weight evenly so it doesn't raise up on one side."
3,Not what I expected,"I just got this table last nite. First it is REALLY hard to put together. Will definitely take more than one person because of the awkwardness of assembly. Second, I thought it folded, by just pushing down and opening by pulling up and locking. WRONG, you have take it apart to collapse it, which is very misleading. Third, I thought it would be bigger than it is. It could most likely hold 2 very little toddlers on each of the 4 seats but I would say its made for more like one on each seat because of the leg area. It would be too hard for them to get out of their seat if two were sitting there. If I had to do it over again I would buy a different one but its is definitely sturdy and heavy and I am sure will last a long time. I'm sure my 2 year old grandaughter will love it. I also liked the fact that the one I bought came with an umbrella."
1,"don't buy, Not worth your time!","I never write a product review, but this product is so frustrating to assemble! I have started this project many times because it is just such a pain - and I hate leaving unfinished work. As far as the fold and store feature...that is only after removing peices and reassembling...what mother has time for that!? It doesn't fit 2 children to a seat unless that are that small and best friends. For this price and the reputation of the Little Tykes, it should be pulled off the market and redesigned. Don't waste your time with this!"
4,Does the job and durable,"I bought this for my new daycare. I cannot honestly see sitting eight children comfortably at this table, but six would not be unreasonable. It is durable, cannot support adult weight. As mentioned in another review, it cannot be folded without removing four bolts with wingnuts, which were not particularly fun to get onto the table, so it would not be convenient to remove and replace them to fold and unfold. But, that's fine for my purposes. I don't expect to store this table. It is used daily and looks new."
4,Great outdoor table,"This table works great! The only negative is to store the table flat & hanging up, you have to take apart some of the table...but we leave it up all the time so it is not really a problem for us."
2,Bad All Around,"This table is very hard to put together and not worth it in the end. The benches are super weak and bow when my 34 pound (3 year old) child sits in the middle. She doesn't like to sit on it because she feels like its going to break. I don't blame her. I bought this because it looks like (and states in description) that it seats more children than the 2 sided bench seats. I thought that it would be great for her party. However, 2 kids can sit on each bench only of they are very small. My mother in law has the naturally palyful one that I wish I'd have bought."
4,Finally a real kids table,"If you are not handy, do not try to put this table together, call a friend or relative who is. Once together this is a great table. It provides real elbow room for kids to sit together & enjoy being at a table w/o the ""shim's touching me/my stuff"" that you'll get when putting anymore than 2 kids at a rectangle picnic table. It's stable & comfy for all my kids (6,4,4,1.5) to be at together for snack/craft time."
2,"""Noise,"" not Art","This book, as anyone well read enough to catch the link between the title and the line in T.S. Eliot's The Wasteland is made aware, is heavily dependent upon other poets and writers for its content and effect. In short, it's not very original. Indeed, the last page in the book contains two concluding allusions to a poem by Ezra Pound. I suppose Ms. Smart either hoped nobody would notice them; or, if they did, to consider her ever so clever for conjoining her work with Mr. Pound's. -Either way, one doesn't get the feel that one is reading anything moving or original here.In lieu of this derivative and misguided work, I would recommend the masterwork of a novella that Ms. Smart is obviously trying to emulate-Nightwood by Djuna Barnes. This book isn't really a work of art, but as the narrator herself puts is, ""The noise of my inside seas.""----And don't call her Ishmael."
3,This is an interesting book,"Well, I still don't know what to think about this book. I finished it and had no idea what had just happened. It is very psychadelic, yet sometimes so overdramatic that you feel embarassed for the author. It is definitely worth reading for a taste of the syle; also it is a very short book.Overall, I am glad I read it, but it is no Vita Nuova."
4,Mostly good,"We use this as a home copier/printerGood points:Instant on - it's great not to have to waitHigh quality printingReasonably fast print speed2-in-1 button copies two 8x11 pages, reduced, onto one sheetBad points:Can't be connected to wireless network with Windows Vista or 7 - main reason we're replacing itPaper jams are inconvenient to fix - no matter how simple the jam, you have to nearly take the machine apartLED screen is often hard to see in poor light conditionsNo count of prints in progress - this is surprisingly annoyingNo easy interrupt - there's a two-or-three- step process involving that dim LED screenNo two-sided printingNo auto-sense for manual paper feed, so half the time I forget and it copies from the main tray"
3,Not what I hoped it would be,I had hoped it would be an improvement over Stevia. I could not tell the difference.I am now going to try slimstevia.
5,WHITE STEVIA POWDER 100 PACKETS,White Stevia powder we always use this as good for my husband who is diabetic. Stevia does not remain in the blood
2,Nu Stevia,Its sweet but has a slight bitter taste. Like the only sweet brand of stevia better. Wife is more sensitive to the bitter taste than I.
5,Hallelujah!,"I started using this powder after suffering through a few bottles of the liquid drops of stevia. They had that weird aftertaste and my green tea just wasn't that enjoyable anymore but I was so determined to stop eating sugar that I endured. Then, a few months ago, I came upon these packets at Whole Foods and was absolutely amazed. The powder is calorie free and with no aftertaste. I wouldn't say it's exactly the same as sugar but it's sweetens my tea so beautifully. Since I drink several cups a day, I am grateful for these packets several times a day.I have never used this powder for baking or for anything else--so I don't know if you can use these as an overall sugar replacement. But for tea or coffee, yes they are awesome."
5,best I've tried so far,"I've tried a few different brands of packeted powdered stevia and a couple of liquids. I found this brand to work best for me. One kind I tried didn't dissolve well, especially when it hit an ice cube in a glass. One liquid I tried had a funky aftertaste, better than with artificial sweetener though, and may be because it also contains vanilla. I tried a liquid with lemon which tastes good, but needs to be refrigerated after opening. This version dissolves quickly regardless of temperature and is more convenient than carrying around a bottle of liquid, and tastes better to me than the Splenda I used for a long time. I also found I had to use up to 2 packages of others for the same sweetness of a half package of this. I guess keeping that open 1/2 packet around is a pain, but it's a pain I'll bear gladly :)"
2,Nice idea,I was excited to try this product as my husband had read about it in a food magazine. I was a bit disappointed that it has a very bitter after taste. It works good in coffee and tea but not in anything without a strong flavor of its own.
4,Nice,The second release from Eyedeas and abilities is definantly a satisfying one.They do a nice job expecially Eyedea he does some very nice rapping.Abilities keeps it simple on the beats and has a number of great scratches.There were 3 or 4 great songs on this album-go buy the album right now!Lyrics-9/10 Production-8/10 X Factor-9/10 Classic-9/10 Replay-8Total=8.5 out of 10 Fingers-Hurricane Ivan the Terrible>The 25th Category 5 Atlantic Hurricane since 1886 re strenghened into a tropical storm
3,Good,"I'd actually give this a 3.5 stars if I had a chance. I hadn't heard their other albums so this is my first. Eyedea is def. a talented MC, he has a lot of range and can spit as fast as Twista if he wants to. He's also a great freestyler and that comes across on this album with some of his ""loose"" flows which are a good contrast to a lot of ""structured"" rhymes from most rappers. Abilities really shape the sound of this album, this isn't like any album out there that I've heard. I love Rhymesayers and I just don't feel that Eyedea is on the same level as Slug of Atmosphere on a storytelling/ emotional content. He is however probably more skilled with the versaility he has on the mic. I'd say that you should buy this album if you're even thinking about it. The only reason I didn't rate it any higher was that I didn't feel some of the songs grabbed me.Good Listens on the track:ReintroducingKeptOne TwentyGlass"
5,E&A,"The simplest way to express what you wil hear from this album is simply Hip Hop its raw creative and inspired, not generic and unifrom like the over rated HIP POP that has plagued the genre. If you believe that hip hop is at a stump, a point where creativity is lacking then I suggest you peep this album...IMMEDIATELY..!and to the first reviewer...E&A the best ProducerDJ/MC group....Hold on young buck peep Eric B. and Rakim..."
3,Expect Nothing,"This album is great but it isn't that great. I love the lyrics but the beat is lacking. Abilities could have done alot better. I work at a record shop at the age of 15 and I have to listen to music all day and I couldn't stand listening to it more than twice in a row. I highly recommend trax # 1,2,4,7,11,&12. and the others are just not really all that good. He could have done better, seriously. If you want something good, go find Rahzel A.K.A the human beatbox. he will keep you intertained for hours on end. you'll never get sick of that Crazy Cat."
5,untouchable,"this album is pure, raw, hip hop skill...from start to finish eyedea and abilities keep their muscles flexed with awesome production, scratching, lyrics, word play, breath control, poetic depth, exact communication and all of the things that make true hip hop beautiful at their absolute best..."
1,Ms,I was so disappointed. Your description clearly states that this teapot was made in the USA and it was not. I didn't even bother opening it up - I just resealed the big box and sent it back. Why would you intentionally not tell the truth and waste my time.Anne
1,Pfaltzgraff Winterberry,"All of the new Pfaltzgraff items are now made in China. I would not trust it, the products may even contain lead???? Pfaltzgraff closed all of its' USA factories a couple of years ago. What a shame."
5,Nice Christmas teapot,"I purchased this teapot to be used at a ladies' group Christmas tea. It is excellent quality, holds a decent amount of tea, and has a lovely design. I think the Winterberry design could actually be used anytime. It is not strictly Christmas-looking."
1,Pfaltzgraff Winterberry Sculpted TeaPot,"I received the Pfaltzgraff Winterberry Sculpted Teapot promptly and in good order, I was disappointed with it because after pouring tea from it, it continued to ""leak"" tea down the spout. No matter how quickly or slowly I poured the tea, it always continued leaking down the spout leaving tea on the table. It is however, a lovely ornamental for the Holidays. I do not recommend it and in fact will return it for a refund.Pfaltzgraff Winterberry Personal 2-Cup Teapot with Tea Infuser Basket"
5,Wonderful,Ah now this is a nice sized teapot..Does a great job brewing this British woman's tea..Love this item and it goes with the mugs I purchased. I call it my Winter teatime set.
3,"It is pretty, but leaks","As other reviewers said, this teapot is nice looking. However, it has a problem. It does not matter how much water I put in, the teapot always leaks when I pour tea out. This is very annoying. I would think the company should have done a better job than this. The basic function should be solid. After all, it is not just a decorative thing."
4,Lovely Large Teapot,"This teapot is better than I had expected. It is pretty, BIG (hold 6 cups, not 4)-- but don't over fill or the spout drips a little. Also, it can be put in the microwave--only have to use one pot to make tea!! We love this pot and although it was purchased for Christmas will use year round."
5,Pfaltzgraff Winterberry Sculpted Teapot,I was stunned when I received these teapots; I had ordered three. They were absolutely beautiful . . . beyond what I expected when compared with the very low price . . . I was also very happy with the follow-ups and the progress reports and the rapid delivery time . . . This was my first experience using Amazon.com. I will no doubt make other purchases in the future since I was so very pleased . . . make that beyond pleased. Thank you.
2,Could've been better,"Yuk. While we love the corn and peas and freeze dried fruits and veggies in general for snacking on, the carrots and tomatoes were dried so hard and you have to REally crunch hard on them in your mouth. Definitely not for the little ones. Maybe they would be good if you were using them for cooking, where they would reconstitiute, but snacking on the whole mix - with the carrots and tomatoes mixed in - is too crunchy and rough."
3,Smushed Product - otherwise good,"This is one of our favorite Just Tomato items. The price is good on amazon, however, amazon failed on their packing. We received the tubs smashed. We were actually going to use one of them as a gift, along with another (busted) tub of fruit. Since these are dehydrated/freeze dried, I would be worried about them gaining moisture during shipping if damaged and it was raining. Amazon won't take back food either. So think about if you mind your tub being smushed up or not."
1,"Styrofoam, anyone?","The other products we ordered from this company were wonderful....this, however was inedible. Reminds me of the dehydrated vegetables in boxed soup."
4,"Enjoyable, if over the top","A good horror read, which withstands fairly well the inevitable comparisons to King's Stand. But it ultimately succumbs to the problem that trips a lot of good horror novels: the need for a big finish takes it WAY over the top. Things begin to spiral out of control about 2/3 of the way through, with the scene in the library with the little men in the painting or whatever shooting back at our hero -- huh? Still, a most worthwhile and enjoyable read."
5,GLORY DAYS OF HORROR FICTION,THIS WILL REMIND YOU WHY STRAUB USED TO BE MENTIONED ALONG WITH STEPHEN KING ALL THE TIME. READ AND ENJOY A FORGOTTEN JEWEL.
2,Floating Dragon sinks,Having read 'Ghost Story' and 'shadowland'I guess I'm on a downward slope with Mr Straub and this book proves it. The horror (or gore) is OTT and unnecesary in a lot instances but the main problem with this book is it just doesnt have a coherent plot There are too many distractions that contribute nothing to the story and just leave you thinking just what is the story ? As usual with Peter Straub the book is intelligently written and he 'jumps' you around the way he likes to which is a particular Straub-ism that he is known for . But at the end of the day this book has been 'over written' and doesnt contain strong enough characters or a streamlined plot to make this a memorable read
1,His later works are better,"not very good. Rambling and disjointed. Read Koko, The Throat and the Hellfire club, in that order."
5,Angela Lansbury and Jerry Herman At Their Best,"I must say that this cd is fantastic. All of the songs are very good and i cannot stop listening it it. it is a pity that Dear World did not get the acclaim as other Jerry Herman musicals such as Hello Dolly and Mame because i feel the songs were way better. The only compensation is that Angela Lansbury won a Tony for Best Actress. My favourite songs from the show are, And I Was Beautiful, Kiss Her Now and I Never Said I Loved You (which i feel is one of the best love songs ever written.). Words cannot describe how good this cd is so after you have finished reading all of the reviews don't take our word for it buy it and see for youself."
5,Thank you Amazon reviewers,"I bought this because of the positive user reviews and couldn't be more thankful that I did. I'm not an expert on the musical form so I can't really speak to the strengths and weaknesses of the book nor the coherence of musical styles of the songs, but I can say with conviction that Angela Lansbury is unbelievably good on this recording. It's difficult for me to convey just how good she is, but I urge anyone whose curiosity is peaked by these reviews to break down and buy the CD. Lansbury's performance alone is worth the price of admission. Her voice is warm, comic, heartbreaking and uplifting. Just beautiful."
4,Dear World is a Dear Friend,"The score is quite lively and wonderful. I guess the book is a dud, as has been every incarnation of the the source material (never seen the show, and never had a chance to). But the singing is grand. Used to have this in vinyl. Glad to see it out in CD. I adore ensemble numbers, and Jerry Herman writes them like few others outside of operatic circles."
3,"Some Songs Dead On, Others Miss the Point","This show does not settle on tone. Songs like ""Kiss Her Now"", ""And I was Beautiful"" hit the nail on the head. Others like ""One Person"", and the title song seem like the bombastic Jerry Herman waiting to escape, and do not fit the play at all. Still, the songs are great when you take them away from the plot, well mabye not the title song. The lyrics are not top drawer Herman and they ruin the mood of the show. It does require more thinking than other Herman shows, and mabye a revival would be in order. My favorite song is in ""The Tea Party"" when one of the madwomen sings ""Dickie"" which pays homage to her imaginary dog. I can recommend this to the Herman fan, or to the person who likes a little more thinking in their Musicals"
3,Bombastic Herman at his . . .usual,"I do not deny that Jerry Herman is an extremely talented composer. Hello Dolly may be dumb, La Cage aux folles may be fluffy, Mame may be cloying, but you cant deny that they have hopelessly tuneful, catchy scores (however empty they may be.) Dear World is no different; the overture alone has enough bounce and charm to outdo many other shows by less talented composers. However - oh, there's always a however - this is one case where Herman's music manages to destroy the material. Dolly, Mame, La Cage - these are robust shows which demand robust scores. Giradoux's Madwoman of Chaillot is NOT. The delicate play is demolished by Herman's bouncy, bombastic, unsubtle music, which as fun as it is to listen to, leaves you ultimately unfulfilled. Stick with Dolly if you realllllly want this type of thing."
5,FOR LOVE OF AMY,"For Love of Amy is a very engaging movie on a lot of levels. Although somewhat ""paced"" in the beginning... it's true poignancy is felt as it begins to take hold. While one might assume, given the premise - a black man taking care of a white child - that the film would be heavy on racial stereotypes and messages, it is not. In fact, the film has far more to due with the difficulties in making complex decisions. It effectively wrestles with the often, grey areas of life.The acting is great and direction by Ted Lange (former LOVE BOAT star) hits all the right notes. FOR LOVE OF AMY is a thoroughly enjoyable, family film. Definitely worth watching!!"
3,For the Love of Amy,The product description made this movie sound way better than it really was. The intention was great but the delivery just didn't do it for me. I watched it all the way through hoping it would get better but never really got a hallmark moment!
4,Easy to use.,Think of this gadget as something you can use during your travels to help you bridge the communication barrier. It is not intended to replace a dictionary for language studies.
1,This is an outdated pamphlet,"Although the basic message is clear and sound, in reality, it's a brief pamphlet that was written in the late 1990's. I regret the purchase and think the writer should update the content before selling anymore."
4,Better be strong!,"This item arrived quickly and I was surprised at how tough it was to bend. But after working with it for a couple week I clearly am getting stronger and am now happy that it has so much resistance, I had one of these years ago that eventually snapped in the middle so I have no idea how long this will last."
3,Bad Grips,This is a very strong twister...but with a very strong twister you need a very good grip...this twister shows vinal bike handle grips but when it came to the house it has foam grips...I asked for them to send me the vinal grip and they sent me more foam grips...like I said very strong twister with poor design handle you need a handle with NO give to it....
4,Good but...,"The Amber Sports Power Twister is great, especially for isometric exercises. The handles were loose, but easily fixed with crazy glue."
1,weak item,"I have a power twist from another company which i purchased for $10 it was stronger and cheaper.I made a complaint with this company got no response.If you want a better product go to big 5 or a Target/walmart type stores, you will get a better product."
1,This thing is gonna get you killed,"i have actually been thinking about this that this bar broke and hit my face, and i sued the company after,and today,just after the first couple of exercise with this new product,the handle bar fell off and because i was twisting it, the bar hit my jaw, really badmy jaw is bleeding now and two of my teeth are kinda smashedi don't know what to do now, sue them or just put it in the trashDON'T BUY IT, TOO RISKY"
5,a real keeper,"This is my all time favorite scent,i couldnt find it anywhere.I now feel like ordering a case of it! haha,i hope its never discontinued!!"
5,One of my favorites.,"I live in a rural area, so sometimes finding the products that I like is hard to do. I used the Supersaver, and still received within 4 days of ordering. I have received many compliments on this scent."
4,Good Perfume,"I like the smell of this after it is on a while it gets better with time, it reminds me of the ocean or the beach."
5,very pleased,MY daughter's favorite. Great birthday gift.Escape By Calvin Klein For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 1.7 Ounces
4,finally,"I've been wanting this for 20 years. Why did I wait so long? I'll never forget the effect it had on me then and while said effect has been somewhat diminished now, it's still pretty nice. Perfume, however, is STRONG and I'm not used to it, so I use it sparingly. Which is great 'cause it'll last me a long time."
3,Bottle Broke.,I give this bottle 0 stars since the pump broke the very first time I tried to spray the perfume. That means I still have a full bottle of my favorite perfume that I can't use. I give the scent 5 stars since it is fresh and light and clean smelling. Too bad I can't get it out of the bottle to enjoy.
4,favorit,"love this perfume, and the price is better then when i have to purchase in stores it also arrive quick"
2,Need Better Product Of Escape Parfum By Calvin Klein,The scent was more alcohol than parfum. I love Escape Parfum and wish I had received a better bottle. I could tell the difference in the brand. I can't get out to mail it back.
5,Calvin Klein Escape cologne,I have used Escape for years. Cannot find it in stores any more. Bought it on line. Fast service. Thanks!
4,"A GENEROUS SIZE FOR THOSE WANTING ""ESCAPE""","This 3.4 oz. bottle is a generous size for those who love ""Escape.""Designer Calvin Klein is quoted as having said, ""Every woman needs her own personal form of escape....""This fragrance is a delightful way to find it in fruit fresh tones of apple, plum and peach undergirded by musk.It's light and apporpriate for both day and evening wear."
3,does not last that long........,"I bought this perfume years ago for the first time and I loved the smell but what I most remember is the intensity of the smell and I could not believe how long the smell lasted. I bought it online this time because it is a lot cheaper than in the store but after a few times using it, I found out that the smell does not last as long. It is the same smell but the intensity is gone. Next time I will buy it at the same location I did years ago."
1,My bottle smelled terrible,My bottle has a cheaper top/cap system and the contents does not have the lovely smell of my previously purchased bottle (from a department store). The real shame is that I was to busy to actually open the package until after my 30 days had lapsed. My fault; please learn from my mistake! Posted by his wife :-)
1,Escape Impostor - Fragrance Doesn't Last,"I've been wearing Escape for about 17 years. I live in a small city and only Elder Beerman sold it. However, they no longer carry the product but said I could get it online for half the cost. They were right. It looks like the same Escape I bought at the store (except the box color seemed a bit off on the shade) but the fragrance doesn't last at all. I used to be able to smell it all day long and even into the evening. With this stuff, I can't smell it an hour later. Consequently, I don't think this Escape is the real thing. I will be heading out of town to buy it in a store now."
1,"Floral, not fruity",I wanted to try this because it's described as a perfume with a lot of fruit notes. I tested it at the store and all I smelled was an overpowering flowery scent which just makes me nauseous. Nothing fruity about this.
1,CAMBIO URGENTE POR ERROR,"Hola. Necesito cambiar esta colonia por la de caballero, me equivoque al realizar el pedido, y no quiero cancelar la orden. Espero respuesta gracias"
1,fake item,this item was advertised as being the original product. Wghen received it turned out to be water based and had absolutely no scent to it. becuase i had thrown the box out and the recipt there was nothing i could do to fued against the product. but it was terrible! it was very immbarrissed as i gave it for a gift!
5,Love it!,"I have worn Escape for years and as soon as I saw it on Amazon a couple years ago I have been ordering from them ever since! The price is excellent and the perfume IS the original Escape. It is no different than the perfume I bought at the store and paid A LOT MORE for. Ever since I started wearing Escape I have recieved compliments on how wonderful it smells! I don't think I will ever switch to another perfume........been there, done that already and I'm not going to do it again!!!!!!!! EXCELLENT PRICE, EXCELLENT PERFUME!!!!!!!!"
5,Still my favourite,This perfume is still my favorite after nearly 20 years. Have been stopped in the street a number of times and asked what my perfume is!!!! Thank goodness I can still purchase it through Amazon.
3,Just ok,The fragrance doesn't seem quite right. I have a little Escape left in another bottle that is almost empty. My old Escape seems stronger. I'm wondering if the bottle I just purchased was not stored properly and/or is really old and it lost strength.
3,Escape for women,"This is an excellent product, and a head turner as many professionals in my organizations are very complimentary and ask to know the fragrance brand and name which we readily offer."
1,Made out of junk - not worth the cost.,"Typically, these work right out of the box. Once you hang them, they seem to do okay. But if you want to hang them, take them down and store them, then use again - forget it. Instead, just take them down and throw them in the trash. We used to have a set for the holidays and another set for all other seasons (6-8 each).They are made so poorly though that every time we store them (even though carefully repacked in the original boxes with all styro-foam inserts), we lose up to 75%. For instance, we just pulled out the Christmas orbs and only 1 out of 7 works. Even though they all worked when they were packed away.) These used to be pretty cheap ($7 -> $10 each) so I didn't mind taking a bit of a hit on them, but at $25 plus - someone must be smoking crack. They are so cute when they're working well, but not worth a single season at this price. Save your cash. Plenty of other ways to decorate at a fraction of the cost."
3,Nice overview - lacks detail,"A very good introductory text on the subject of Earned Value for projects. The text is written almost as a ""white paper"", wherein the main thesis is to advance the EVM concept as a viable method of cost management and prediction. Unfortunately in this respect, the books contains very little detail or specific numerical examples that the reader can follow and double-check or solidify their understanding with. The authors are closely connected to Primavera Systems (co-founder, consultant) ... maybe they don't want us to understand too much about the computations, lest we discover the simplicity of the programming. To be fair, they hardly mention Primavera software (P3, Suretrak). Real-world examples are severely lacking, and would provide much more credibility to a concept that has been slow to become an industry standard. This is a good text which will remain in my library ... although in a dusty darkened corner."
1,OUT DATED,Why would anyone buy this edition - it's outdated. There is a newer edition with a lot more current material and it has over 50 pages more text. See isbn 1880410273 for the second edition of this title. That newer edition deserves all the compliments mentioned above and below for this edition.
1,OVERLY COMPLICATED,"IF YOU ENJOY READING DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS THEN BUY THIS BOOK.Microsoft Project 2002 calculates Earned Value and explains the concepts in PLAIN ENGLISH in the help menu.This is a typical PMI publication:POORLY WRITTEN, OVERLY COMPLICATED and BORING."
2,Not the best Project Managment book,Had to use for my graduate level Project Management class. A fairly easy and user friendly read but didn't have the best content or good real life case studies.
1,Not impressed at all!,I am not impressed at all by this book. It could have actually been a pamphlet instead.
4,Very Imformative,I would recommend this book to other beginning PM's like myself.Easy to understand. worth going back to for reference.
2,This book needs to slow down!!,"This incarnation of Batgirl is bad but I'm afraid this book is. Cassandra Cain has an interesting back story but has no personality or reason to read about her other than watching her mindlessly fight. She has the slightest of supporting cast and they both serve the same purpose. Puckett is rushing Batgirl along and readers have no time to get to know her or why we should care. The art is serviceable but too cartoony for me. Overall, a book worth skipping."
3,Good Overview,"This book provides a good overview of Ferrari road cars. It presents the history in a logical fashion and covers just about all the cars in the line and clearly delineates models. Some cars get more coverage than others and some get short changed. I did not like the excessive number of black and white photo's (I think it is a crime to show a Ferrari in B&W) but there are color photos as well, just not enough. Overall a good book, though perhaps too expensive."
3,"Nice, quick workout","Ignore the Frank up there. I am a woman talking here.I have a pretty draconian exercise regime and was wanting to add circuit training to it. This is a good workout for when you have little time (it takes about 1/2 hour). Tony is very personable and motivating.The problem was that it became TOO easy after about 3 weeks. I went from beginner to advanced in about two weeks and from 5lb dumbells to 10lbs dumbells. He hints at a third level DVD, but I haven't been able to find it.I recommend doing this on alternate days and doing something like ""The Firm"" (Which is killer hard) on other days."
5,"Funny but warm and sensitive, a classic Banks catagory",In the catagory genre this is definitely a 5 star keeper. Enjoyed the playing out of this romance as much as the finale.
2,Meh..,"This game was a disappointment. I was told that the game had an awesome musical score (which it didn't), that the gameplay was fun(it was tedious) and that the jokes were funny (they weren't).Perhaps I expected to much after having played similar games with this type of style (ie, Day of the Tentacle, Sam and Max, etc). But this game really didn't hit the mark. I only finished it hoping it would get better, but it really didn't. The ending might possibly be the worst part.Not recommended."
4,NEW FOUND LIFE,"I found this book,dynamic,tense,violent and yetthe writer draws you to compassion.As he himself findsNew Found Life in the coming to find Jesus. Its a fastmoving story of one man in search for faith and under-standing of what life is and means to him.Its a soulsearching of his reflection on his past to the present."
3,the perfect size but not sturdy,This is the perfect size for the left sink of my Elkay double bowl sink. Unfortunately the steel bars are thinner than the sink bottoms made by Kohler. This cannot handle heavy loads of plates and pans which can bend the material down.The drain hole is located at the center and did not feed into the sink drain.
3,wrong size given,The item looked perfect but it did not fit in my sink. The reason was the size. It was a little bigger than the specifications stated. I will just cut the corners so it will fit on my sink using a saw for metal.
4,Just what I was looking for,"Fits perfectly in the sink, easy to clean and doesn't rust. This item is hard to find in any store since most do not carry stainless steel. The plastic ones don't hold up for long. Very pleased with Amazon.com - delivery was fast and the ordering process was simple. So far, so good."
2,happy disappointment,"Fortunately I had to return the product because it was too large for my sink, which turned out to be a good thing for me. The merchandise was the same as the one that I previously used, for quite some time. I was replacing it due to normal wear and deterioration."
3,Ok Corvette Video.,Covers up to 1988.Some Mistakes.Basically the same as America's Favorite Cars Corvette Dvd And Corvette Americas Favorite Sportscar Vhs 1998. (except that one has other footage and different narrator). Other Than That A Good Vid.
5,Highly Sought After Lansdale Item,"Collection of early and rare Lansdale stories assembled by a small press intended for die-hard fans only. Novices, please first check out the Drive-In trilogy and the Hap and Leonard series and then come back to this. A beautifully published cloth woven hardcover with a wonderfully illustrated dust jacket and a red ribbon bookmark.Lansdale wrote an introduction for each of these rare uncollected stories, some are good, some bad... as the title says.I would pay good money just for the introductions to the stories. Lansdale has a very funny and introspective outlook on life and the publishing industry and anything else he writes about. His folk humor shines here as he showcases his early works for those of us who care."
4,Enjoyed your company in South Bend...,"Greetings lovers of music that grooves... I'm not sure if you all would remember me, but on the off chance that one of the Skalars checks this web site from time to time, I remember shacking you up in my house in the fall of 1996 where you played a show with a Notre Dame band called the Skalcoholiks... I owe you all a CD (we finally recorded one!). I was the crazy bass player. I loved you guys. Hopefully I'll get a chance to see you all again sometime."
1,Not worth the buck!,"I used for 3 months, and it got rusty. Tried to call the customer service no. in the service manual to exchange one. I ran into difficulty of getting their office hours so that I can go into their warehouse to exchange it. It sounded like a one-man operation. Won't ever buy their brand again."
3,"Clever, cutesy holiday stories","This book is a compilation of three short stories by three different authors, all focused on very different events in women's lives at Christmas. They are all clever, humorous depictions of emotional dilemmas which seem like they might be best serialized in a woman's magazine. The book is an entertaining, light read, but certainly not terribly impressive nor memorable. It would probably make an appropriate gift for a female friend, as many women could relate to the situations described: disappointment with an emotionally empty marriage, jealousy of your new husband's ex-wife, and always feeling in the shadow of a too-perfect sibling. Of the three stories, the last was my favorite, as I enjoyed the plot, humor and the writing style of Liz Ireland more than those of Jane Green and Jennifer Coburn. I won this book through Goodreads.com in November, but it took nearly three months to receive it, which meant the Christmas theme was no longer timely by the time I read it!"
1,This Christmas,This book was the biggest waste of time and money!I found them boring and without any real substance. It probably took the authors about 1 day to write each book.They probably laughed all the way to thier banks.
4,Best short story collection that I have ever read!,"I am not a big fan of short story collections, I have read quite a few in the past and have never been too impressed with any of them but for some reason I still feel compelled to purchase them in hope that ""this one will be different"". Well `THIS CHRISTMAS' was definitely different! This is the best short story collection that I have ever read hands down. Each story put a smile on my face and kept me totally enthralled. I like that there were only three stories to this collection so I was able to actually care about these characters and what happened to them. My favorite story was `MISTLETOE AND HOLLY' by Liz Ireland, this story which was the longest of the three was smart, funny and heartwarming. `THIS CHRISTMAS' is a definite must read to get you going for the holiday season!"
2,Cute,"This book is 3 short stories from the three authors listed. It's cute, but I'm not running around telling all my friends about it. It is what it is....something to pass the time at a doctor's office or catch a few pages here and there before bed or in the morning before anyone wakes up. There's nothing compelling about any of the stories, therefore it's easy to put down and do other things. The commentaries on life and relationships that tie the three stories together are nice."
5,CM=Best coffee,"oily, fresh beans, very fruity (CM always put in alot of flavor) wish I didnt have to have 4 the same.... but the price is unbelievable-you could get 2 bags of cm under other distributing companies for the same price"
3,Be carefull !!,This Timex color is Golden !!! I was looking for a silver one... The picture is not good... Do you believe this watch is a gold (almost yellow) one ??
2,Not what I expected,"Very nice watch with great features BUT it is made to sit on the side of your arm not on top like a regular watch. Yes, it has OVA but I'm not so lazy that I can't turn my arm 90 degrees to see the watch face. Understand OVA before buying this watch."
3,A little bland,"It's allright, but a little bland and dry. Not a whole lot of details at time. Had to 'force' myself to read on during some chapters. Really don't feel like I learned anything new about the Peterson or Smart cases or about forensics in general.Brad"
1,This game sucks,"to keep it simple : this is one my most hated games. though i like this more than fester's quest (also a sunsoft game), that's not saying much. the controls are sloppy, and a pain. the difficult is terribly hard ( I CANT GET PAST LEVEL 1 - AND I HAVE HAD IT FOR 13 YEARS!) avoid this, unless you are a true batfan, even then, keep it only for collective purposes. however, the original, BATMAN by sunsoft for game boy/ NES is quite fun. I recommend that."
4,Multi-sensory money fun,"Using more than one sense is often the best way to learn. This very basic book offered my child a chance to hear about, see and play with money (without emptying out my purse). She enjoyed learning about the basics, but loved the stickers. It provided a fun source of reinforcement for the content."
2,"It lacks the ""it"" factor","On a 5 star scale I consider 2.5 starts as average. Since Amazon does not allow for half ratings, I put in 2, but consider this item a 2.5 star rating of average. Needless to say I purchased a bottle of HP Sauce and promptly tried it with a meal. It is sweeter and more one-note in flavor than I was expecting. It's neither catsup (sweet), nor Worchestershire (complex) nor A-1 (a bit of sweet and complex). It is somewhat sweet and vinegary, but the ""complex"" I was hoping for did not come through for me. For example when using Worchestershire or A1 the tongue picks up numerous levels of spice, sweet and savory that I did not get here. To be clear, HP Sauce is pretty good, but for me at least, it will not replace the aforementioned sauces."
5,The Conditioners Book,"This is the bible on how to condition a horse inside and out with nothing left out, Learn how not to do it ...exceptional"
3,Lavish drama of Hanoverian plot to rule Britain,"Fine British drama of the Hanoverian plot to take over the British crown, placing George I on the throne. Fine acting from all concerned. Joan Greenwood as the discarded queen who finds solace in the arms of a young guardsman (Granger). The acting trophy goes to Flora Robson who should have netted a Supporting Oscar nom for her finely shaded ruthless, yet human, spy and intriguer. The extremely lavish sets and costumes are stunning. Oscar nom for Art Direction."
4,A Classic film not to be missed.,"After many years, I was thrilled to see this film back on DVD, in a good edition. It is a classic. with a superb cast. All previous dvd editions around are in terrible condition, but this one is as good as one can expect. Maybe someone will do one of those hi-tech restorations in the future, but at least this one can be looked at and enjoyed without pain."
3,very bad copy,"The movie is wonderful, unfortunately it did not get the attention and distribution it deserved. However the VHS copy is absolutely terrible."
3,not good for winter climate,"I just installed my Driveway Patrol last night. It worked great inside and it worked well outside... for a while. However, a problem arose after the transmitter was left outside, in wintertime Vermont for several hours, with temperatures in teens.My son drove in the yard setting off the chime, as anticipated. However, the chime continued to go off for several minutes as I went back outside and retrieved the transmitter. I brought it inside to warm. After a few minutes of warming up it worked fine again.I have since decided to place the transmitter indoors, near the main entrance, until spring when I will, again, place the unit outdoors beside the driveway as originally intended.The price on the unit is too good to send it back, so I will keep it and use it when the weather is warm enough.The chime is somewhat annoying with two volume settings... loud and wicked loud.As a whole, though, it is fun to have around and will be useful in various applications around the house."
1,Bad,"We ordered a couple of these devices and they don't work. Let me put it another way. They DO work when someone enters our drive way, but....... They are CONSTANTLY going off for no reason.Drove us crazy after 4 days and we threw them in the trash."
4,"Amazing for one, somewhat good for another","We bought this for our lab mix that's incredibly, incredibly hyper; has separation anxiety; and barks constantly. For her, it worked, but not amazingly so. She did calm down though, which was definitely a plus. It did take about 2 weeks for it to really kick in at all on her.With the excess we cut off, we managed to make a small one for our chi boy that's afraid of storms; the big dogs; and pretty much everything else. This worked WONDERS on him. Within a day or two, he was not acting tough or trying to guard himself against the big dogs; he was just chilling with them. I admit it didn't really help too much with storms, but it helped a bit. He's acted like a totally different dog since we put it on him, for the most part.I'd say this is definitely worth the money to try if you've got a problem dog. It's way cheaper and safer than the alternatives."
2,Not worth the money,"I didn't see any changes in the behaviour of my pet after using the collar for so many weeks. Don't waste your money on this, in my opinion. Use it to buy him some treats instead. :o)"
3,Still hopeful,"My three year old greyhound has recently developed anxiety to thunder, fireworks and gun shots. We bought this on the advice of our vet. At first it worked great but the July 4th holiday pushed him over the edge! I do think it has helped to ease some of his anxiety but that we will need to combine this with medication when there are fireworks or severe thunderstorms expected. I would still recommend this to anyone dealing with an anxious dog since it does seem to lessen his anxiety."
3,I really couldn't tell a difference...,"I had really hoped this collar would make a difference -- and it MAY have during the first week or so (it may have just been wishful thinking). At any rate, after the first few days there was no difference in my dog. He still barked everytime I left him alone - the WHOLE time I was gone, according to my neighbors. My current solution is just to not leave him. I wait until dark to go to the grocery store so he can stay in the car - at least he seems to understand then that I'm going to come back. He actually SHAKES, as if with fear, if I pick up my purse and head for the door. He has never been this way before my husband passed away and we had to move to a senior park where he has no outside access without me. He's old and I just guess it's been too many changes at once."
2,Adaptil collar,Did not notice much of a difference even after two weeks. Do not know if a longer trial experience is needed to notice a positive difference..
4,DAP collar,"I purchased the collar because my 7 month old puppy, who is really insecure anyway, suddenly became afraid of the hardwood floors! I read that this might help. I did notice a slight difference in her behavior. She became a little more calm and would walk to her food and water bowl when she wouldn't before. Overall, with the collar and a lot of calm treat reinforcement on a leash, I was able to get her over most of the floor insecurity. I would recommend the collar if you are excercising regularly and just need something to help a little extra."
1,Disappointed,I was really looking forward to trying this collar. I had heard about it on a local pet show on TV. My lab has issues with certain sounds and storms. Unfortunately it did not work for him.
1,"Adaptil, DAP Collar for M-L dogs",Shipped fast. Did absolutely nothing for my dog when we had a bad thunderstorm! She was the same basket case whether she had this collar on or not!
2,Had the opposite effect,"After using this product for a week, instead of calming my over enthusiastic 11 year old it actually had the opposite effect and made him more insane."
2,Adaptil Dog Collar,"I got told this collar might help to calm my dog in the car but unfortunately it hasn't worked. He still shivers and open mouth breaths but it was worth a try,i know it has worked on other dogs unfortunately for me this wasn't the case."
1,definitely NOT worth the money,"Our Chocolate Lab has a lot of anxiety/fear issues & we bought this after his trainer from puppy school recommended it, hoping it would help appease his anxiety a little. Honestly did not make the slightest difference in his behavior. We tried it for the first time right before a 3hr car ride (he usually has anxiety in the car) and to my surprise, his anxiety was actually WORSE than it normally is in the car. I tried checking the papers inside to see if there was a Money Back Guarantee, but there isn't. Very upset I wasted so much money on this. :("
1,Lonely Greyhound,This product did not help my Greyhound. She really missed her friends and the pack that she ran with. Good luck.
3,Just started using this product,"This is the first time I have tried to use this product. So far, I have not seen much change but I am willing to try for one more month before I throw in the towel."
3,Didnt work,"Shipping was very fast but the product didnt work for my dog. It may just be him since this collar has worked for others, but it seemed to actually make the anxiety worse. Also, it was very big on my medium sized dog as well. I gave it 3 stars because i dont know if its the product or my dog since i have tried 2 different collars."
2,Ineffective for separation anxiety,"Our veterinarian recommended this product and we actually purchased it through their office for double the price. Some reviewers have speculated this product's ineffectiveness stems from getting it from sources other than your veterinarian. I am writing to dispute that. We tried this collar in combination with 1mg of xanax for our two-year-old Vizsla mix with separation anxiety. Neither worked. We tried two collars over two months and saw no change in our dog's behavior. He still chewed up random items in the house when we left. For $80 for the two collars, we feel cheated. For $36, we ordered a Thundershirt, which will last much much longer than a collar. Look it up on Amazon, it may be worth trying that before the DAP collar or diffuser. We haven't got it in the mail yet, but are more hopeful for that product in combination with continued behavior modification."
1,Not effective,"I got this (and the spray) for my son's 1-year-old rescue Boxer who has severe separation anxiety. Neither product was effective with THIS dog. I know other people who got much better results and that's why I wanted to try it out. The collar is difficult to fit properly and if it doesn't have continuous, direct contact with the body, the pheromone can't be absorbed into the skin. Then try to adjust the collar ... no way! It was worth a try but certainly didn't help the situation at all. My son continues behavior modification strategies - slow, but sure - and he's making progress. I just wish this product could have helped it along."
2,dap pet collar,"our dog is a bit schitzo, & this didn' t calm him. i wasn't expecting a different dog-but the claims as to a calming effect were bogus. sad."
1,Don't waste your money!!,We purchased this product for our dog after moving into a new home. We started having bathroom issues with her. She would urinate in the house as soon as she was left alone. She is an older dog and we have never had this problem before. Some one suggested this product so we tried the collar. We saw no change in her behavior. She was not any more calm or comforted by wearing the collar. The collar also has a bad odor and her fur around her neck began to smell bad after a couple of days with it on. Personally I would not recommend this product.
3,"Doesn't work for dog aggression, but not sure it claims to","Our vet said we could try it for dogs that are aggressive toward each other; it didn't work at all for that, but I don't think that is the collar's issue, just bad advice from the vet; obviously the aggression is not caused by anxiety, so it didn't work. If you receive the same advice, don't bother trying this route."
2,Did not seem to work,Kinda seems like magic beans. Had it on our dog and didn't notice much of a change. Then you have to buy replacement collars if you want to continue.
3,Works? Maybe for some.,"The DAP collar has a reputation for working--for some dogs. I've seen it be effective. However, it had little to no effect on my own dog. So I'd recommend trying it, but not being too surprised if it didn't do the job. The supplier was great--efficient, timely shipping of the exact product ordered."
1,dont buy this,"Within a few days this product started making my dag violently sick. This product was vet recommended. After a 350 dollar vet bill, i removed the collar and my dog got better within a few days. Its unfortunate i didnt heed the other warnings that the customer reviews published on Amazon."
5,Works well for my dog,"I have a little girl who likes to harass my other dog. She is 100% happier when she wears these collars. It doesn't change her personality, make her tired, or make her loopy like a drug would. I can't explain how or why it works, it just seems to make her less stressed and more relaxed."
1,"May work for some, but not for my dog!","This may work for some dogs, but not mine. I was really hoping it would help her with her separation anxiety. But, she got worse. She started to have excessive drooling, swollen tongue, bloodshot eyes, elevated body heat - every time I left. I have since removed the collar and over the course of a few days she has gone back to her ""normal"" anxiety level. We're still working on it. I tried the thundershirt - did not work. Tried rescue remedy - did not work. Tried calming treats, stuffed frozen kongs, and more - nothing worked. Two days ago I began to take her cycling - she trots alongside me. This seems to be tiring her out a little bit - in turn, taking some of the edge off. I have also been working to desensitize her - picking up car keys, putting shoes on, doing things to act as if I'm leaving - but then, I sit down or do some chores - I don't leave. Now she can't tell if I'm going to do the dishes or walk out the door. I think we're onto something. I hope."
1,Not for my dog!,"I purchased the collar because my 4 year old standard poodle is afraid of thunder, fireworks, etc. On a perfectly clear calm day I put the collar on my dog who promptly retreated to my bathroom (his usual hiding place) and curled up and refused to leave. I removed the collar and tried again a couple of days later with the same result. This was NOT what I expected or desired. I threw the collar away and received a holistic calmative from my vet."
1,Didn't work.,"Worthless P.O.S Placebo. That's all this is. It's not a collar, it's a piece of rubber you tie around your dogs neck that usually falls off, and considering it's typically used for puppies having a hard time surviving without their mother, well when it falls off you find puppy has sunk his teeth into it. Save your money, buy the spray cause that stuff actually works."
2,Please explain,I ordered the ADAPTIL brand D.A.P. collar for my dog. This is what I had purchased previously from our veterinarian per her recommendation. We had great results from this specific collar.I received the CEVA brand D.A.P brand collar instead. This is NOT what I ordered. I would appreciate being informed if another brand collar is being substituted for my requested item before it is shipped. This is not acceptable.
1,Did nothing for my dog's sep anxiety,"Bought this collar because my dog has severe separation anxiety. Wanted to try something simple like this before I looked into meds, etc. Collar came, resembles that of an old flea collar. Had it on my dog for four weeks straight like it recommends, and saw absolutely NO difference in the anxious behavior. Perhaps it works with small things such as fear of people, but if you have an extreme case- I suggest you skip it."
5,Unexpected but effective,"Our vet recommended this product for our Great Pyrenees. I fully expected it to not work at all, but it settled him down within a few days to the point that we were able to more effectively work with him. I changed the collar once a month over the summer, always wondering if it was still working or if I was just seeing what I wanted to see. A few months ago, though, we noticed that our dog was getting restless and anxious again no matter what we did...and then we realized that it had been seven weeks since we changed the Adaptil collar. With a new collar in place, everything was right again in 2 days. It really does work!"
5,Life Changing Product!,"No smell like others. Use on my Springer Spaniel who has epilepsy & her seizures completely stopped, which her meds weren't doing alone. Also she is MUCH calmer and happier. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"
2,No apparent effect,My new rescue dog has separation anxiety so I was hoping for some calming effect when coupled with training. There was no apparent effect. Perhaps this product is better for other problems. I was disappointed.
5,Fantastic product!,"I had to put my dog on anti-seizure medication which caused him to stress out to the point he went 3 days without sleeping. He just paced and paced. He also was messing in the house which he had never done before. Two hours after the collar was put on, he finally went to sleep and slept for almost 24 hours. His personality is back and we both are back to sleeping again. I am not sure it works this well for all dogs, but I know it is a life saver for me. For the price, it is well worth a try. {No more peeing on the carpet either!}"
1,Made my dog sick,"I had high hopes for this product, but within hours of putting on the collar, my dog had both vomiting and diarrhea - and my dog almost never vomits, so I doubt its a coincidence.From reading the reviews, it seems pretty hit or miss, and at its cheap price tag, you might as well try it - hopefully you have better luck than I."
4,Works!,"I have tried EVERYTHING except for prescribed drugs. My girl suffers from separation anxiety, and is afraid of thunderstorms. I bought this thinking it would do what every other thing I bought did...NOTHING! Within a day, I could tell a change, it's not a total cure for her, but it definitely took the edge off of her separation anxiety and for the thunderstorms, she just raised her head when a rumble came along, I was amazed. She would shake and pant and would want to crawl inside me if she could, now it's just a raise of the head. She's more confident on walks...it's worth a try people, it may not work for everyone, but I'm extremely thankful it worked for me and her! My next stop was to the vet for anti-anxiety drugs, now I don't have to do it! By the way this is for the collar..."
4,Dog seems to be calmer .. placebo effect?,"We have a large dog that can be overly sensitive, and maybe a little neurotic. Our behaviorist recommended a DAP collar to see if that made a change, while reinforcing a strict schedule and training regimen. After about a week of putting on the collar and following the regimen, we noticed a bit of an improvement. We noticed the largest improvement during thunder storms. Before the DAP collar, our dog would freak out and shake at the slightest rumble. During the most recent storm, he just seemed bummed out and only shook a little. That seems an improvement. It's pretty expensive, but we think the price is decent for the results we've seen."
3,Worth trying,I don't think this collar did much for my male Great Pyrenees that is suffering from severe separation anxiety after a long cross-country move. I haven't been able to leave him alone for more than 30 min. since July. He is now on a behavior modification plan and medication after seeing a veterinarian behaviorist. I plan to try one on my female Great Pyrenees that is very afraid of storms.
2,Ineffective,"I had high hopes for this one. I've tried other pheromone-type collars with good results. Unfortunately, this one did nothing to calm my anxiety-prone dog. I would not buy it again."
2,"No noticeable effect after 2+ weeks, BUT...(read)","My vet suggested one of these based on her assumption that my dog is anxious. It's had no effect so far, but my take is that the dog is ANYTHING but anxious. He's just easily excitable, especially in the car (which he loves to ride in) and barks like crazy at anything that moves - cyclists, runners, flags, birds, it doesn't matter. Traffic cones seem to set him off too. He has a huge smile the whole time; he's not anxious, he's having a blast. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because I think this is a treatment for a problem my dog doesn't have.I'm also trying a DAP spray and a calming dog chew called Composure (both also available on Amazon) and they have had no noticeable effect either. Acepromazine works, but my vet frowns on anything more than very occasional use of it in special circumstances. Sigh."
1,BEWARE Tires Know to Split on Sidewall,"After less than a year of owning these tires, I noticed that my front tire sidewall split resulting in a flat. I've always taken well care of my tires, proper tire pressure and never ran over anything that would result in such damage to the sidewall. Do you research on these tires, they are know to split on the sidewall for NO reason at all. I contacted Panaracer (Panasonic) and they said that they would do nothing besides forwarding my complaint to Japan. They said that the split was a result of something cutting the tire but as you will see in the picture, it is not a cut but a pulling of the fibers away from the webbing. BEWARE for you own safety. DO NOT PURCHASE PANARACER series tires. I'll post a picture of the split."
5,Excelent Anatomical Equine text,"I made a couple of purchases before getting this particular book and was finally satisfied with this one. Excelent detail on musculoskeletal system of the horse with bone landmarks and muscle origin and insertions, innervations and actions covered. Very useful text."
4,Great Resource,"As a veterinary student, this is an absolutely fantastic resource, and will definitely be one of the ""keepers"" for the rest of my career. It is especially nice because instead of being strictly an anatomical resource, it also has clinical references of relevance. I love that this information is kept separate (anatomy in the front of the book and clinically relevant material at the back) because it doesn't distract you while you are studying the anatomy. The only reason this review is 4 stars is that the translation to English sometimes is not very clear. I would have given it 4.5 stars were that possible. My recommendation - get this book! I am also strongly considering getting the others two (dog and cow)."
2,Disappointed,"After reading the other review I was expecting this to be a great planner. However, there were no pockets to put contracts in; the binding came loose after using it a few times; it was difficult to photocopy anything; and it was not very functional. There are better planners out there!"
3,Great book for the cookie cutter wedding!,"A friend gave me this book and though it gave me some helpful advice at first such as terms for picking out my dress and the basic structure of a wedding it was very rule oriented and boring. I hate the idea of someone making up rules for my event! I don't care what they think are ""deadly sins"" and the cookie cutter plans they came up with. I would recommend something else with a little humor, this book is dull and on the verge of being outdated."
1,Our Hidden Lives,"I don't seem to have received this item, yet. I cannot, therefore, rate it correctly."
2,Wouldn't recommend.,"The graphics really hurt this game. You can barely see the enemy unless they are two feet in front of you. Your character is also very slow to move, aim, and fire. I would go with Ghost Recon"
1,conflict desert storm,can't use the arrow keys to move forward etc.options won't let you change the movement keys.grafics are good except objects in the distance.this is the jack of all junk
5,Awesome Game,"This is the most realistic game i have ever played!!! Thrilling, exciting, and realistic missions!! The game is based on the Persian Gulf war of 1991. Your missions can go from the streets of Kuwait City to the deserts of Iraq and Saudi Arabia. A huge inventory of weapons from a bazooka to C4 plastic explosives. You can pick from the British SAS or the USA Delta Force. You control 4 soldiers at the same time if you choose to. There are real ranks and medals for completing missions well. This is a very good game with great graphics and story line. I seriously sugest you buy it."
4,Desert Storm,"This game is fun and exciting, but rather short. If there had been more missions or even longer missions, I'd rate this game at 5 stars. But it's still addictive, and I play it over and over, on all levels of difficulty."
1,Not worth a new-game price.,"A poor game all around and vastly inferior to SOCOM. The animation of the on-screen characters is pathetic, shot Iraqis go flying through the air like they're made of styrofoam. The comabt is not very realistic, nor are the graphics, nor are many of the sounds and voices in the game. The worst thing about this game is the weapons targeting. Your character can target automagically, except when the game messes up and swings the gun in some wild direction, blah, it's not even worth another full sentence. Avoid it."
2,Scared me a little,I was pulling my Harmonic balancer on my '96 Impala ss. Any good mechanic will tell you to make sure 100% to thread the screw through the entire width of the H.B. I did just that. after i started pulling the HB all of the bolts came flying out of the HB! I thought I might have ruined my HB but when I looked at the three bolts all three were completely stripped and warped. The quality of the bolts are not high enough for some pulls.
2,...or maybe 2.5 but it has too many fillers,"In the beginning, Magnum had a more progressive approach. With the very good ""On a storyteller's night"", the band turned towards a more melodic and AOR oriented musical direction, something that stood out even more on the follow up ""Vigilante"" (their best effort?). On this album, ""Good night L.A."", Magnum continue deliver polished rock but the material is not as good as on previous efforts. There are way too many fillers and mediocre songs, even `tho the tracks ""Rocking chair"" and ""Heartbroke and busted"" are among the best in their long career. If you want to explore Magnum, this album is not the best starting point, and I believe you have to be a big fan to consider this effort essential."
4,Dowco 50084 Guardian Motorcycle for Trikes,Received product within time stated by seller.When I went to place cover over motorcycle it was a very tight fit even though the seller stated that it was large enough to fit over my trike. I have a 1986 Honda Aspencade trike conversion. It is usable but it could be a bit larger.
2,Motorcycle cover,"When the bike is covered, it traps moisture in the bike and leaves the metal oxidized or tarnished. Terrible. I do not use this cover."
2,Apocalypse Then,"The Doctor and Ace follow the Timewyrm's trail to the far future, where she is now on the planet Kirith. The world houses an utopian society, but with a dark secret. A secret the Timewyrm will exploit...The third part of the Timewyrm quartet rings a little hollow, with the planet Kirith effectively interchangeable with many other semi-nondescript planets visited by the Doctor. It certainly doesn't impress me as the utopia it is supposed to be!This book continues to develop the Doctor as a major manipulator storyline, spun-out from some of his activities in the last season of TV stories. This facet is probably the most interesting of those on display in this book.One of the features of Doctor Who as a TV serial is that forgettable stories come along from time to time. This book sadly continues that tradition."
1,Oh so boring!,"The first one was amateur, the second trite. This ""Timewyrm"" is just boring. It is completely Doctor Who-by-numbers - no surprises whatsoever. Its link to the overall Timewyrm concept is even more tenuous than the last book. The only real saving grace is the occasional Troughton-era flashback, but those are far and few between. Skip it."
4,"Book was good, but not as great as I had hoped for.","It may have been that my expectations were a little too high. After all, this is one book dealing with 3 different types of airliners. Don't get me wrong, I don't regret my purchase, and I would buy it again, but it isn't exactly what I had hoped for. The section on the Convair airliners was very short, but maybe that is to be expected since there not not many of that type made. Overall a good book, but not one of the best."
4,"""Dead Boys,"" like its prequel, pushes the stylistic envelope","This is a difficult, absorbing work reminescent of William Burroughs (with nods to early William Gibson). An intricate postlinear narrative makes the protagonist's morbidly erotic future world palpable and uncomfortably _real_. Calder is a gifted experimentalist and ""Dead Boys"" is like no other novel in its genre."
1,DO NOT BUY,"Wow. This game would be great, if I could use it. All I have managed to acomplish so far is mess up the view and cause the game to cut out. It seems to me that this game was deliberately designed to annoy and aggravate everyone who bought it. While it may seem appealing because it claims that you can EASILY design coasters with a large selection of pieces and supports, that is an outright lie. This program is terribly hard to use and is too complicated for anyone that isn't a professional programmer. I followed the tutorial instructions(booklet, not in-game), and, guess what, the game cut out. This is a great game. (note the sarcasm in the last sentence)"
1,"zzzz, better be an engineer if you buy this turkey.","It's hard to believe any company would release a simulator game these days without an on screen tutorial. This game is only for the advanced coaster builder or someone who doesn't mind spending [money] and 30 hours learning to use the non-intuitive manual. If you like Roller Coaster Tycoon, you'll hate this snoozer."
1,"Game looks fun, but sucks in XP","Wel, after saving some allowans, I had enough to buy this game.Installing is no problem but when trying to load an example track, it will just return me to my MS-Windows XP desktop over-and-over again.Shame I have pend my hard earned $7 on this. . . ."
1,PLEASE CALL A GAME DESIGNER,"For one person...as myself who is incrediblely gifted in the world of computers...even I couldn't have fun with this game. The graphics are awful (in my opinion...too advanced for their time) and the coasters are next to impossible to complete. If you are interested in buying a coaster game...buy a version of Roller Coaster Tycoon. Roller Coaster tycoon is basically a very well drawn game...not 3D, but it looks so. Although you actually can't ride the coasters...you can watch them and they are so easy to create. For anyone who is or isn't blessed with the knowledge of computers...don't buy this game."
4,Does an OK job,"I bought this item because I can no longer find Joint-Ritis, which is the only thing that helps the swelling in my neck and shoulders. This stuff works ok, but not nearly as good. It's the next best thing that I can find. Has no scent and absorbs quickly."
5,ATI All-In-Wonder X1800 XL 256 MB PCI Express Card,it is a brand new item as the description. excellent . fast shipping
5,"Action, adventure, and above all, comic relief.","This book is about the draconians from ""The First Dragonarmy Engineer's Secret Weapon"" short story in the book, ""The Dragons At War"". These dracnians are also in a short story from,""The Dragons Of Krynn"" (aren't they lucky!) . I loved this book for its substance, and strength, things you don't get in just any Dragonlance book. But in order to really enjoy this book, you have to be alert, and remember a lot of things from the either one of the short stories. If you don't, it doesn't really matter that much. I'm just saying that because I followed my advice, and enjoyed the book a LOT!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Great book, but a few problems.","Not so much the page turner that many dragonlance books are but still great. Although still distinct the Draconians were too humanized in this book, I had wished they would be more different from humans in their ways. The best parts were with that weird skinny dwarf, he was quirky and cool!"
5,Seeing the Draconians in a New Light,"This novel gives us a closer look at what was previously painted as a despicable race. In this novel I almost forgot that the draconians are good eggs gone bad, the product of an evil magic. Because here, they are a race desperately wanting to continue their existence and to be useful to the cause they originally pledged their allegiance. So much so that Kang, their leader, was almost willing to have a symbiotic relationship with the dwarves. At one point, one can almost relate to the desperation of the army to survive and be useful. This is because Weis and Perrin developed well the characters in this novel."
4,Suprisingly good book,I never thought I would like a book about draconians but the characters were well thought out and suprisingly endearing. For once I got to see things from the draconians point of veiw. I guess the fact that it's a Margaret Weis is a big plus for it.
5,Wow..,"If You Have Read DragonLance Books In The Past And Have Enjoyed Them, Then This Book Is A MUST HAVE! I Recently Read This Book And Couldnt Put It Down! I Read It In 2 Days And Just Now Ordered The 2nd Volume!"
3,Too bad the Plot is unoriginal,"The Dragonlance series was my first experience with the fantasygenre over 10 years ago. Since then, I have read many fantasy booksand dabbled into D&D gaming.I thought this book was well written and humorous at points. The only thing is that the plot is unoriginal. It's straight out of your typical AD&D game: find a treasure map, go through a dungeon, defeat a monster, get the treasure, the end.I read fantasy to be presented with something new or a twist on an old subject. Unfortunately, this book did neither. You will be entertained, but the plot has been done a thousand times before"

5,The Highlight Of Bob Marleys career.,"This was Bob Marley and the Wailers, last album, but is probably their best, it would of been even better if they had put some songs from ""Confratation"" onto here like ""Buffalo Soldier"" and ""Stiff Necked Fools"".Because ""Confratation"" was made at the same time as ""Uprising"", 1980, but they didn't like thoughs' songs, so they put there favourites onto ""Uprising"", they made a mistake of course with some of the songs they shelved.Imagine how could Uprsing would of been with some of ""Confratation"" songs on it.A mistake by Chris Blackwell.But the album is very good, and includes my all time favourite songs ever, ""Coming In From The Cold"" and ""Coul You Be Loved""."
5,Dis Book is Da Five Star BOMB!,"Hey, check this one out. First of all, you gotta fine sistah who is tryin' to fit in by selling her beautiful body, and then you got her man tryin' to make it alright by not fallen in love with her and while dealing with the death of his friend. And then you gotta a brotha who is smokin' dope and tryin' to get his freak on. All of this and a struggle against the system that tries to keep us all down. And don't even get me started on the freaky love makin. Hey all, fight the good fight, 'cause this book be telling it like it is! Keep the Faith!"
2,DISAPPOINTING....NOT MUCH SUBSTANCE....,"I ORDERED THIS BOOK OFF OF AN ANONYMOUS EMAIL I RECEIVED. NOT SORRY THAT I DID, BUT NOT IMPRESSED EITHER. FOR A BOOK THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CONTROVERSIAL, I DIDN'T FIND IT THAT MUCH SO. SOME DECENT SEX SCENES, BUT OTHERWISE VERY BLAND."
4,This Story Would Make For A Cool Movie!,"This story is too much. Did all this really happen at Stanford?! The writer does a great job of keeping things going and Chapter 16 is almost too graphic. But several of the chapters did ring true to the so-called college experience. Very entertaining characters, and a must-read for anyone who enjoys reading character dialogue that sounds real."
3,Pseudo Cool has a handle on Stanford,"As a Stanford Student, I would say that Pseudo Cool has a fairly good feel for the culture and flavor of this area. The characters, however, are hard to believe, and the plot is just ""ok."" Overall, a good paperback, and an interesting read for those who go to school here."
1,Is this it?,"I read the back of this booking thinking it was going to be interesting, but I was highly disappointed by page 15. This book has no plot, the charaters were not developed, and the book just abruptly ended. All of the characters were shallow and could someone please give me an explaination in Garrison's death. I am so sorry I wasted my money on this book."
1,I was disappointed with this book.,"I believe the story the author intended to tell was interesting; however, he did a very poor job delivering the message.First of all, the book was poorly written grammatically. The reading level for this book can not be higher than fifth or sixth grade. Unless this age group was the intended audience, I think a book written about college experiences should AT LEAST be written on a college level.Second, I believe the author should have focused more on the racial struggles that the African-American students were going through.Lastly, the book did leave quite a few unanswered questions, such as to suggest a sequel. I do hope there isn't!"
3,A Great Attempt,"I think Mr. Green made a great attempt at exploring issues faced by minority students at institutions of higher learning. It was an honest look. I found his characters to be fascinating, and only wish that he had gone further, looking even deeper. When I finished the book I wanted more, I wanted to know what happened. It seemed like the end should not have been the end. I certainly hopes he writes a sequel to finish the story he began."
4,PSEUDO COOL IS STANFORD UNIVERSITY!,"I attended Stanford several years ago and this book is indeed a very interesting read for someone who is familiar with Stanford's unique campus environment. I am not African-American, and the best that I can say about this story is that I wish Mr. Green had had a more enjoyable college experience not so heavily influenced by issues regarding race relations. I do recommend this story to others--as it can certainly go a long way in helping to promote a dialogue that seeks to improve the college educational experience of ALL students."
1,In a word...........Bad,"Have you ever kept trying in vain at something even though you know it is a forgone conclusion that it will not get any better?That is the feeling produced with Pseudo Cool. The storyline was disjointed, the characters impossible to emphasize with and the writing has potential but needs much more work in story development.No Bang, no pop. Borrow it from the library folks."
2,Disappointing....not much substance,"I ORDERED THIS BOOK OFF OF AN ANONYMOUS EMAIL I RECEIVED. NOT SORRY THAT I DID, BUT NOT IMPRESSED EITHER. FOR A BOOK THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE CONTROVERSIAL, I DIDN'T FIND IT THAT MUCH SO. SOME DECENT SEX SCENES, BUT OTHERWISE VERY BLAND."
3,ok,"This is the story of five college seniors, who's been through some rough times. drinking to much, one sleep with men to pay for school, one is realizing he is gay, and they are all dealing with the death of a good friend. I didn't feel like the characthers were developed enough, and I throught a lot of things was left out, but overall pretty good."
2,DISAPPOINTED,There was no ending to the story of characters. Left me wondering what happened! Never explained what happened to the characters death!!! NO ENDING IN SIGHT!!
1,"Oh, please.","Certainly not worth the hype. I actually found this book quite shallow and illogical. I don't know of any BSU presidents who would be dating a prostitute. And no one seems to think there is anything strange about Ashley being a call girl, Kevin being a drug addicted pimp, Jason bleaching his skin and wearing contacts. Garrison's death was not fully explained, I couldn't even get a sense of his character. This book just careened wildly from one subject to another, never making much sense at all. It was a waste of money."
3,A complete introduction,"This is a great first book in stocks. Before reading this book I didn't know what questions to ask or where to begin investing in the stock market. I especially like this book's ground up approach1) providing motivation to invest2) defining stock jargon3) introducing professional tools and resourcesThe rest of the book introduces investing strategy, stock analysis, economic trends, and many many other details. I like how the author doesn't seem to be pushing an agenda, but just introducing the tools to be used by both aggressive and conservative investors."
2,"Stars of the Russian Ballet / Galina Ulanova, Maya Plisetskaya...","I guess I should have looked at the year of these performers before buying this DVD. The danceing wasn't all that good, the sets were poor, but the costumes were alright."
4,An informative view of the life and times of Preston Nichols,This book is especially intersting to ufo enthusiasts and people who have read any book in the Montauk series. This Novel mostly describes the life and times of Preston Nichols. If you have read any of his book and are interested in where he came from you should check this book out.
5,Great data for techies,Encounter in the Pleiades is one of the best books of this type that I've read so far.I've ordered more by these authors and enjoy many hours of reading their exciting stories.
2,Not for the lay reader,"I think this book was too scientific for me. I have had statistics classes at the graduate level, but I think I expected this book to include a ""popularized"" discussion of the topic. It was too much like a text for me."
4,The Great Lost Donovan Album,"This is the one that got away. Ask anyone about this record and 99.9% will have no idea. In vinyl terms, the second side of this LP is among the best stuff Donovan ever recorded.Remember, this came out in 1970 and if you listen close you can see a signpost pointing the way to the future of T-Rex. Close your eyes and you can hear it. If Donovan took this band on the road and toured to support this album when it was released he may have had a chance to to re-vamp his career and claim a spot with the great ""Glam Rock"" artists of that time. The band supporting Donovan was perfect for him. The only thing preventing this review from 5 stars is the annoying habit of overdone falsettos (especially on Roots Of Oak) through-out the record but that does not prevent one from enjoying the truly outstanding songwriting and subtle musicianship. Poke At The Pope is typical Donovan - a cross of folk & jazz phrasing mixed together: Great Stuff! Go out and buy it!!!"
1,"Buy the LP, not this sonic disaster","This is Donovan's best release, but DO NOT buy it on CD. The mastering is absolutely awful. Find a used LP of it and if you can't play LPs, have someone transfer the LP you just bought to cassette or CDR.The sound quality of the CD is criminal. Everything was maximized. That's where the quietest sounds are brought up to the same volume as the loudest sounds. The end result is no subtlety remains, no contrast remains, no music remains, no artistic vision remains.Not only that, but as others have mentioned, when remastered many portions are obviously and painfully DISTORTED. I don't know if they had a deaf chimpanzee running the controls or what. If so, he must have taken frequent banana breaks and left the mastering desk entirely for extended periods."
5,just as i had hoped it would be,this has always been one of my favorite donovan albums. i was thrilled it was available on cd and have enjoyed listening to it in my car over and over again. it is a classic!
5,A True Nostalgic Gem Piece,"After 34 years (!) OPEN ROAD is still my Donovan's favourite album and one of those to which I have returned all along those years, over and over again, and with the same pleasure (it has always been in my top 5 albuns of all time). And when Repertoire Records edited it on CD, in the beginning of the millenium, I felt myself one of the luckiest people on earth. Because this is a true nostalgic gem piece from the old days, full of happy memories..."
3,not enough Galway,There are only four songs with James Galway. The way this recording is presented is misleading and buyers should be aware that this is NOT a joint effort between these two great artists.. I was totally disappointed. I think Henry Mancini is wonderful but was expecting to hear a collaboration. So if you're looking for flute music this isn't it. However it's a great collecton of Henry Mancini's work.
3,lynne s cd s,"Not one of my favourite cd s play it now and again, I find it quite repetitive,but give it a go"
3,Shocking...Revealing...One Mans' Truth...Read it!,"If Vietnam Veterans, felt betrayed, GLR, felt even more so! Read this book, and you will know why, he felt this way, and why others' might, as well."
1,"Horrible book, waste of time","I was disappointed with this propaganda-filled book. Avoid this at all costs. If you're looking to get your head filled with hatred and propaganda against non-whites, go ahead. Otherwise, steer clear of this horrible book."
1,"In defense of being an inbred, redneck, sister-fisting hillbilly moron","Every time you drive through a trailer park and see a loose collective of GED-having NASCAR fanatics, all adorned with confederate flags and swastikas... Ask yourself:Did the South successfully secede from the Union?Nope. They lost.Did Hitler's gang of Goose-Stepping automatons successfully conquer and maintain control of all of Europe, like he wanted?Nope. That didn't work out too well either.RACISM AND HATRED ARE THE LAST REFUGES OF THOSE TOO STUPID TO MAKE THERE OWN SUCCESS WITHOUT BLAMING ANYONE ELSE!"
2,Not what I remember Scratch N' Sniffs to be,Anyone can make a sticker. Trend was known for their Scratch N Sniff stickers when I was young. These stickers are basically nice stickers that sort of smell like something other than paper or glue. This is not the purpose of them. They are supposed to smell distinctly like their intended food. Stay away if you are seeking a quality fragrance.
3,Interesting read!,"Although Twain did not finish this book, it had a bizarre ending that was very strange! Maybe, very ""un-Twain-like!"" Those who collaborated to finish the book had a nice time!"
3,Okay,I frontline it it was really really boring I mean really boring so why did you even write it then
3,A Classic Writer,Not one of Twain's best but an interesting look at the nature of good and evil. Best left to devoted Mark Twain fans.
4,Great Read!,This was a great read! Lots of mental twists and turns. I found I couldn't put it down because you didn't know what was going to happen next.
3,Not Twain's Best,"An OK read, but not Twain's best. These were stories from late in his career and I think his talents were waning. The primary story, The Mysterious Stranger, didn't even sound like Twain. I question whether he even wrote it. I read somewhere that his agent put it out after his death. Maybe it should have been left alone. I didn't particularly like it. Twain's legacy will aways be TOM SAWYER, HUCK FINN and A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR'S COURT."
5,"Mark Twain, an Internationl Spy","In The Mysterious Straqnger complete manuscript, that includes rough draft and complete unedited notes, Mark Twain predicted World War I. Mark Twain died in 1910. World War I started in 1914.Mark Twain states that Germany was targeted for destruction because it as a nieve country, living in the age of faith, when the rest of the world was living in the age of reason.Mark Twain repeatedly mentions Father Adolph, and Marx.Mark Twain stated that a few rich bankers headquartered in the U.S.A. started World War I."
1,"""Mysterious Stranger"": sick, bitter, and twisted","Twain's bitter edge kept getting sharper and sharper as he grew older, till finally only the bitterness was left. ""The Mysterious Stranger"" was his last work, and Twain is full-bore in his hatred of man, God, and everything in between. He was so intent on spilling his bile that he didn't even bother to come up with an ending, which is one of the most sophomoric I've ever seen; Heinlein would say it's equivalent to ending a book by writing ""and the little boy fell out of bed and woke up."" It's a shame that Twain's writing should be forever tarnished by this final piece of literary drudge, a book so bad only English majors and prison inmates are consigned to reading it. Read some of his earlier work instead (e.g., ""Innocents Abroad"")."
5,Recommended reading for the nutritionally challenged!,"If you are a Christian, and even mildly concerned about your own health or the health of your family, then My Body-His Temple: The Prophet Daniel's Guide to Nutrition is the book to get you going. Not only is it informative, it's motivational. The author gives scriptural reference for many points included in the book so you can go to your own copy of the Bible and see for yourself how God intended for us to nourish ourselves. My Body-His Temple reads well and it's interesting. The vegetarian recipes included are a nice bonus and make the book well worth the money spent. I consider this book recommended reading for the nutritionally challenged (namely me)."
2,Needs a good editor,"The positive side of this book was the number of great pics of huge bluegill. The text is a rambling of the author's thoughts on how he's caught bluegill over the years with a lot of encouragement toward bringing kids into fishing. Mostly geared to the very beginning fisherman and would be quite suitable for kids. I enjoyed reading it in the beginning, but about halfway through, lost patience with the rambling style, misspellings and poor grammer. The book would have benefited greatly from a competent editor. Powells Books is selling it on their website too. Not recommended for anyone beyond the complete novice angler."
1,Too polemical and political,"This book seems to be a vehicle for the author to advocate excommunicating politicians who do not oppose abortion. New Commenatary on the Code of Canon Law by Beal, Coriden and Green looks imposing by it's size but is not so difficult to use and is a much clearer and un-politicized explanation on excommunication in the Roman Catholic Church."
1,Biggest Ever Book of Misleading Nonsense,"A child reading this book will learn that the reason ""Why some lands are richer than others"" is that ""Some lands have good soil, where crops can grow,"" while ""other countries have poor soil, little rain, and no minerals.""Really? So is it superiority in natural resources that explains the wealth of Luxembourg and Hong Kong? Governmental policies have nothing to do with it?A child reading this book will also learn that ""The most important person in a country is the head of state.""Really? So for example in 1936, in an England that included Francis Crick, Paul Dirac, J. B. S. Haldane, F. A. Hayek, Aldous Huxley, John Maynard Keynes, C. S. Lewis, George Orwell, Bertrand Russell, Alan Turing, Frank Whittle, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Virginia Woolf, the most important person in England was the blithering nonentity named Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David Saxe-Coburg-Gotha Windsor?"
5,Gotta love Gena Showalter.,"I never get tired of her stuff.Beautiful Shaye gets kidnapped by the king of nymphs, Valerian. She's cynical sassy and head-strong. He's gorgeous, arrogant, and confused.He know's she's his life mate, she just wants to escape.Unfortunetly, there's no way to leave Atlantis without help and survive.Plenty of laughs, enough story that you don't feel guilty for enjoying the steamy sex scenes, and only one or two moments where you might want to cringe. It doesn't get much better than this. It even has a nice side story for another character, fleshing out the whole.The third book in her Atlantis series. Gods I hope there's more to come."
2,Not as great as author says,Wasn't that impressed by this book. I think Gena has written way better books before. I am disappointed she hyped it up so much
4,A Fantastic Read,"Title: The Nymph KingAuthor: Gena ShowalterSeries: The third book in the Atlantis series.Genre: Paranormal RomanceRecommended for: Fans of Kresley Cole, Laura Kaye, and Paranormal Romance.Rating: 4 BookmarksReview: Gena Showalter once again doesn't disappoint with the third installment of her Atlantis series. Shaye, the heroine of this novel, was a very string and admirable character and it was difficult to not admire her inner strength and resolve to never depend on anyone, especially a man. This resolve begins to fade and change when she is abducted by Valerian and taken to his underwater realm.This novel was easily read in a day, with its' witty dialogue and the description of how the characters were evolving along with the story. It was fast paced, with a lot of action and unexpected twists and turns in the story line. The Nymph King is a must read for Gena Showalter fans and anyone else that is looking for a unique and different paranormal romance to devour."
2,Did we all read the same book,"This book was another example of writers trying way to hard. I think the author had a great core story but there were just too many side notes, from the heroine's personal problems to the dragons, vampires, Poseidon, and the nymphs ARRRRRRGGG!! Character overload. In fact some of the secondary characters were more interesting than the main 2. Borrow this one or make sure you have a discount when you buy it!"
2,very boring read,For some reason could not get into the storyline or the characters. Too much stuff happening all over the place with no real relation between any of it. The characters are unbelieveable and the situations were so forced. The concept could have been good but somehow got all lost and boring. Read all 4 books in this series only because I got them all at one time. Will not be reading anymore Showalter's stuff.
4,Great Story...Love Scenes a Little overdone,"I absolutely loved this story. It had developed characters, conflict, lust, love and absolution. The only criticism I had of Showalter's ""The Nymph King"" is that I thought the love scenes were a little overdone.I would definitely recommend this book to a fellow avid romance reader. Gena Showalter is quickly becoming one of my favorite romance writers."
1,Never recieved....,"I would love the chance to rate this book, and am pretty sure that I would enjoy it alot because I have the others in the series. BUT I haven't had that chance because even though I ordered it, it was suppose to arrive by the 12th of March and I haven't received it. :("
3,Really Light Stuff,"Weeell. It was okay. Like the previous reviewer said, it was a cute light read; good for a distraction on a hot, lazy afternoon at home. It's so light I ran through it in just a couple of hours. Shay's character was about the most interesting thing about it - she was quirky and funny - but after a while you do get tired of the come hither/keep away routine. Brenna and Joachim, side characters, had the potential to actually be a more interesting story (more substance, less fluff). The whole book takes place in just a couple of days and leaves you with the feeling of having watched one of those Saturday afternoon tv movies from the 80s...I wouldn't really recommend that you spend your money on it. You'd probably be better off getting it at the library. Like I said, it's really light stuff; so if you like paranormal-type romances with a little more grit stick with Feehan, Kenyon, Kresley Cole, JR Ward, etc."
1,No...awful,"The worst in the series, even if it was the first. I'm glad I didn't read it first, or I would have been turned off from this author.Shaye was an absolute, unlikeable, completely unrepentant bitch. I didn't give a crap about her, and hoped somebody would punch her or slap her every now and then. She was so rude and selfish, and utterly stupid. I couldn't have cared less about her, and felt so bad for Valerian. But he really only liked her for how she looked, it felt like. So they really didn't belong together at all.They could have both been written better, at least.Unless you're a die hard Atlantis series fan, skip this one."
3,;0),"3.90 StarsI still like this story even though i gave it 3.90 stars. for me some parts took i while personally for me to get into, the sex was good as well. Shaye was a very independent woman and Valerian seem vain at first but it wasn't bad, what he did in order to win Shaye as per the rule of is people was interesting. Not really my first read by the author but I'm still getting my feet wet with her body work so this will not be my last book by the author either.**************************"
3,So....So....3.5 Stars,"It was just okay. It did not WOW me. Shaye/Moon was a little bit of an annoyance. She spent most of the book being angry and hating everyone. Valerian's ego over shadowed the entire story. It wasn't great or my favorite, but okay. Maybe if I read it again in a couple of months it may improve to 3.5 stars. I make no promises."
2,The Nymph King,Not a very good book. The premise is way out there. Maybe if the sex scenes were better it would have helped. This book is not worth the money.
5,Love This Book,"I loved this book! My second favorite in the Atlantis series by Gena Showalter. If you like reading about sexy, strong men who literally survive on passion and sexual encounters, this is definitely the book for you! Side stories and side characters capture your heart as well as the main characters. I read this in one day because I could not put it down!"
5,Nymph King--where have you been my whole life???,All I can say on this one is OH MY GOD!!! You've gotta read this one. HOT HOT HOT.
4,word of warning,"Ok, I only gave this book 4 stars because it took me a while to get into it. It was only when I was about to give up and did the ol' Amazon search on the author's name that I realized that it was part of a series. And not even the FIRST in the series. So, my word of warning is: DO NOT READ THIS BOOK TIL YOU'VE READ THE OTHERS IN THE SERIES FIRST. There are some parts of the book where assumptions are made that you know/understand what's been covered already that were a bit confusing, and I think that's why I couldn't get into it at first (at least, that's what I'm hoping.) I will go back and re-read the book after I read the first 2 in the series and will then either edit this review or write a new one telling that I did/did not like it when I understand the world.This was the second of Gena's books I'd read, and I LOVED the first one (Playing With Fire.) I'm hoping that this one will go up to 5 stars after I read the rest.Ghostdancer"
3,not as good as the others in the series,"I thought the characters were great. Very sexy men and intelligent, strong, and passionate women, but I felt Showalter was a bit lacking on plot. There was no strong conflict or climax. Women taken through the portal, king finds his mate, dragons come, vampires come, live happily ever after. There was nothing for the reader to worry about or wonder about. The herione's resistence to falling in love wasn't a strong enough problem and there was not a strong enough reason for her to hold back her affections.I still enjoyed the fact that there was yet another installment to the Atlantian's saga. I'm still hoping there will be some relief for the poor vampire king. We'll have to wait and see."
1,Very little actual substance to this 'novel',"If all you want is heaving sexual tension and blatant sex with little - in fact minimal substance to the story, then this is novel for you! Personally, I feel cheated."
2,Ok For What It Was,"If you're looking for a quick, erotic read with not a whole lot of intelligence or substance, just a lot of hot guys who need a lot of hot sex and a lot of desperate women willing to give it to them...this is a good read. If you're looking for something any more in depth than that, you won't find it here. This is basically the same kind of erotic story you can find in any number of books all over the internet. I can't really say the writing was anything special. It was a typical erotic fantasy romance. Nothing more. If you don't mind that, this can help pass the hours fairly enjoyably."
2,ok its really about sex,"This book had an interesting premise, and I would love to see Valerian the nymph king in person. That said, it really was about the sex. The romance was side for Shaye was not very convincing--I like more emotion with the sex part. I skimmed some parts and felt a bit dissatisfied. I think I am getting tired of the ""one mate"" replay, so this could be my own bias."
3,Season 2 better than Season 1,"As with all shows the second season of this show really kicked it into high gear. We see more into the personal working of these characters, Brennnan,Shalimar,Jessie, Emma,and Adam.This season was considerly better than the 1st and the awful 3rd that followed. Agh if only twentyth Century Fox would just shutup saying this show bars there chance for a X-men show when is the last time they even did a telivision show? This is what promted alot of changes that resulted in a horrid 3rd year for this show. Peaple are very hard on this show. But come on peaple it is telivision do you really believe everything you see? Exactly so why does it all haft to make cents. Just watch and get lost in the magic that is Victoria Pratt."
4,good product at a good price,Item was as it was stated although not as robust as I would have liked but does perform perfectly. A big bang for your buck and I highly reccomend this socket to those who are looking for a tool that works but won't break the bank.
1,Does not fit original OEM pump or AC Delco replacement pump,"Completely useless for its intended purpose. The vendor obviously has a major quality control issue. The internal diameter of the wrench was to small to fit over the old or new water pump, and the tab spacing didn't match. After wasting a lot of time figuring out what was wrong. I purchased an Autocraft brand at the local parts store, and it worked in 10 seconds."
4,amazing live show,saw them at the wetlands in NYC on a rainy night...crazy cool show----CD is great as well but i definately reccomend the live thing
4,Suspenseful Medical Thriller,"I liked Pulse and Paradox a little more than Panic, but it is still a very good story. Echo Heron is now one of my favorite authors."
3,Exciting book -- but too many viewpoints,"This book is certainly suspenseful -- heck, I nearly finished it before leaving the store!However, the excess of multiple viewpoints distracted me, so this book became a frustrating experience. Don't get me wrong. I love getting the viewpoints of different characters in a story. Especially the main and secondary characters. But there's no need to also have so many minor characters getting their own viepoint scenes.Anne M. Marble Reviewer, All About Romance"
5,Excellent,This is a terrific product that provides immediate relief. It takes a bit of practice to figure out how best to tape the injury but once you do - amazing!
1,High Price!! Amazon went up almost 5$ on these diapers!!,"you will find them cheaper at a Wal-mart, it was to good to be true... Kim & John West"
2,Poor Diaper,"For the price you pay, one would expect a premium diaper. However, they leak easily and the tabs rip off easily when you go to fasten your baby into them. I prefer two other well-knowns brands that start with L and P before this one."
1,What happened to the great deals?,"Just as I recommended Amazon to all my friends, prices went up $4-5 a pack!!! What happened? I thought Amazon had a great thing going. Now I'm completely disappointed in them. It was a great way to get people to buy other products as they placed their diaper orders - not anymore!! Huggies is a great product, but I won't buy them from Amazon at this price."
2,they leak out the filling!,"After having 4 children in diapers now I recentl;y re-tryed the Huggies brand Ultrathin style of diapers. While I do believe they fit well and the stretch waistband is nice they have a very nasty problem with falling apart. Whats up with this? Usually a good product now Falls all to pieces inside after being wet for only a short time. To the point of when removing the soiled diaper it showers out the filling and makes a real mess. Have you changed your prosses?, or filling material? or something? I would be interested to know and unfortunitly will have to advise anyone who cares to avoid this product..Thank you for your time."
1,Jeff Lynne is not on this album.,Move along now...Jeff Lynne is not featured on this forgettable piece of live doodie.
4,Required text at Univ of Chicago Grad School of Business,During the school year this book is available at the main campus bookstore
5,Golf shoes,Extremely comfortable and at a reasonable price! My husband was very happy with this purchase. It also proved to him how easy it is to shop on line.
5,"LOVED it, but it's a better value to buy the whole set.","I bought this DVD not realizing it was a part of the Chased By Dinosaurs series, and paid $30 for a 45 minute episode. Then I realized the entire series (on 1 disc) was about the same price and was a little mad, although I really wasn't into the dinosaur episodes (rented on Netflix after all this happened) - I'm mostly into sea animals myself - so it wasn't TOO big a deal.Fantastic graphics - when I first caught part of this on tv, my sister and I were unsure as to whether or not it was real! AND, Nigel Marvin, the zoologist hosting these shows, is an actual zoologist that works out in the field, not just an actor with computerized dinosaurs, which makes it doubly cool.Two thumbs up, fascinating, exciting and informative :) I bought the CBD series for a few other people as presents and they were thrilled!"
2,BEWARE: Not Vinum Extreme - Just Regular Vinum Glasses,BEWARE: They shipped me not Vinum Extreme - but rather Regular Vinum Glasses. Maybe they don't know the difference but it just wasn't worth the hassle to exchange them. Not good.
4,Spare battery,"Purchased this battery as a spare, good for the price but only lasts about 80% of the original battery. Still get around 400 shots out of my Olympus E-500 camera including some reviewing of photos."
2,Doesn't last as long as original manufacturer's,"I alternate between the original battery that came with the camera and this DigiPower unit. After about three years of use, the original is still working perfectly, the DigiPower doesn't hold a charge. For most of that period, the two batteries were indistinguishable, working fine, so I guess you get what you pay for."
5,Required reading for cartoon fanatics!,"""Of Mice &amp; Magic"" is, I believe, one of the most comprehensive books ever to be compiled on the subject. Maltin shows his love for cartoons in every word.In light of the recent animation boom, however, it would be nice to see a more recently updated edition.One of my favorites"
3,"SHOULD BE ENTITLED ""HISTORY OF US THEATRICAL ANIMATION""","I found this book to be an excellent reference source for cartoons produced to be shown in theaters. However, entitling it ""A History of American Animated Cartoons"" is not exactly truth in advertising. I think most people (except for perhaps some obsessive purists) would agree that the cartoons produced for television from the 40/50's onward would also be considered American Animated Cartoons. But none of these great cartoons (i.e., Gumby, Beany and Cecil, Clutch Cargo, Hanna-Barbara's Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, Pixie & Dixie, and others through the present) are included here in any detail. Also missing from the appendices of studio output are the more obscure products like Warner's Private Snafu and other animation produced for corporate clients. Mr Maltin would do cartoon lovers well by commissioning a second volume to complete the story."
3,Mower Blades,"The blades were of excellant quality.The only thing was they were not correct for my mower.When ordering they were the direct replacement by the website,but not for my mower size."
4,Oregon replacement lawn mower blades,"Excellent price, blades came painted including the cutting edges. Cutting edges not very sharp. I would definitely purchase again because the price for two blades was less than local dealer wanted for one new name brand (deere) blade."
4,Great product but be careful when you detach magnets,"This has all the great characters you would expect from Futurama in all their classic poses. One caveat--if you are going to use the magnets and are not buying it as a collectible, be careful when you remove them from the sheet. Nibbler's antenna has an especially narrow connection to the body of the character."
2,There miss 3 tracks from original albums !!!! TOOO BAD,"Be careful !There is not really 2 LP on this CD, as 2 tracks are missing from album ""victory"" :""Strike a Match"" & ""Love is Alive"". And 1 track is missing from album ""Planetary Invasion"" : ""Today my love"". And this is not mention in the booklet !Too BAD"
5,Rah rah,The product is of good quality plastic and the right size for a toddler. My son enjoys playing with this megaphone.
2,Get what you pay for...,"Set up and synching to my Sony Ericson was very easy (hint: hold the button down for longer than the manual says- till you see both red and blue lights). Either my or the headset keeps losing synch but it's straighforward to re-establish. The speaker quality is excellent as well as the volume control. The microphone only works if you use the additional over-the-ear attachment and the foam speaker cover. Both move the mic away from your head so it can pick up sound. With that done, folks say I sound ok but not as good as without the headset. Without doing that, folks say it sounds like I'm talking through my chest. For the price- it's not bad."
2,Very disappointed,"As a traveling sales Manager I have had many wireless headsets and this one ranks as one of the WORST. Especially for IOGEAR, I have had other Iogear products and have always thought of them as being quality. Personally the design was poor and the person on the other side could not hear anything I said. I tried it for over a week by the end of the week the power button stopped working also. I am definitely disappointed in the headset and more so with Iogear. Remember this is just my opinion, I bought the headset from good reviews I read and maybe it was just the one I received that was so poor, you be the judge.."
2,Not so great...,This headset currently sits in my ashtray in my car. It is hard to hear on and keeps disconnecting from my phone. I had people complain that they could not understand what I am saying as well...
4,Very good value for the price,"I've used a lot of bluetooth headsets including some reputed to be the best like the Jabra 250. The iogear headset is almost as good and less than half the price. Mine paired quickly, has good sound quality and range and works quite well with my SE 610's voice commands. Battery life is very good and I like that I can charge it from my notebook with the include USB charging cable (as well as normal AC charger that is 110-240, important when I travel). I also find it very light and small. It is comfortable and easy to put on. The only problem I've noted is that if the phone is in a holster on my left side and the headset is on my right ear, my head seems to cause interference. Otherwise, a good headset at a very good price."
2,NEED SOFTWARE THAT IS NOT INCLUDED,Note that if you plan to use this headset with your PC you need to get and install Bluetooth Software. I haven't found it yet.
2,Poor holder for the ear...,"What is not shown in the picture of this item is the very poorly engineered ear holder for the headset. It doesn't hold the ear securely at all. I didn't even get to charge the headset before I noted that the holder was so flimsy that if I moved my head barely, the thing would fall off. The earpiece is on a swivel attached to the speaker, which does not position the headset in a consistant manor. If I can't keep the thing on, there's no use going any further. Iogear needs to put some extra thought into this problem."
2,compatibility issues,for about 2 hours I couldn't get this to be seen by my pc using an airtech bluetooth dongle. I've tried using the bluesoleil software as well as widcomm. I don't know which is on compatible with which. I've given up. Has anyone gotten this to be seen by their pc? which dongle should be used for it to work with this headset? (I'm using Windows xp with sp2)
1,Try something else!,It looks nice and compact. Came with USB charger. Sound quality is not good. I want to get it off if I talk longer as the low quality sound starts to annoy.
3,4 Seasons,"I totally agree with Thomas. Sometimes the ratings given just does not add up after you purchase the CD.Xue Fei Yang is indeed a great guitarist. For some folks like us, we enjoy great classical guitar music but the music selection in this CD is just boring. I hardly play it after hearing it a few times...As per my review of her other CD - 40 degrees north....strictly for classical guitar players and Xue Fei Yang fans....Hear out all the pieces before you buy."
4,Great Historical Book,"I think this biography on Benjaman Franklin was very informative,interesting,and more exciting than the usual historical book. It was easy to read and had some of his famous quotes written on the bottom of the pages. I would recomend this book for kids who are interested in learning more about Ben Franklin or who need more information about him for a school project."
5,The funniest golf book ever written!!!,I first read this book in 1977 as a requirement for my high scool golf team.I was actually sent to the principal`s office because my laughter was disrupting other student`s in the library! The antics of the gang at Goat Hills is a absolute scream. It`s Jenkin`s at his best. I `m buying extra copies for my foresome to read at the 19th hole!!
5,One for the ages,"I bought this book when it was first published and I absolutely loved it. I was in college and was so envious of Jenkins and his cronies. Doesn't every guy want to have a group of crazy friends who can act outrageously without repercussions? Don't we guys all want to know someone who can drive up directly onto the golf course in a Caddy and bet anyone he doesn't have a duck in the car? When I was in my dorm sharing a room with a nerd and pretty much having no friends I thought these guys were the coolest guys in the world. It's the funniest sports book, maybe any book I've ever read. If you love golf you will love the history of the sport from a master sports writer. Even if you don't you will enjoy reading about the way the pro tour was prior to todays' sanitized version. Those guys certainly had some character. If I can figure out how to do it I want to send my first copy to Jenkins and have him sign it for me."
5,King Lear Blues,"C.D. Wright has been afflicting the comfortable in poetry for some time now. Her poems amount to a continuing revolution. ""Cooling Time"" demonstrates form in order to talk about form: essays blur their borders with poems, lyrical meditations and diamond sharp bits of memoir. The relationship between her thinking and her feeling is seamless. And you can hear her as you read: demotic, classical, and wicked smart. Lear gets down with backwoods. Any poet who wants his mojo reactivated would be well served to read this book. Read it in little bursts like attacks of carnal love. Rest in between. Then reread. This book is like really fine spicy collard greens."
4,What's in a name?,"I don't know the history of this company or why SPORT is in it's name, but what I do know is that I love this chocolate bar. I do wish the percentage of dark chocolate was higher, but these are bars are already expensive enough as is. So I'll just enjoy these as they are."
5,EL MEJOR CHOCOLATE QUE HE COMIDO EN MI VIDA,EL MEJOR CHOCOLATE QUE HE COMIDO EN MI VIDA.ME ENCANTA EL CHOCOLATE Y HE COMPRADO VARIAS MARCASPERO ESTE ES SIMPLEMENTE DELICIOSO 5 *****
2,The wrong chocolate,"Unfortunately I received, instead of Dark Chocolate with whole hazelnuts, Milk Chocolate with whole hazelnuts, and this is a big difference for the connoisseurs. I hope the next time to receive the right chocolate."
3,Patrick: Separating Fact from Fiction,"Likable from start to finish, 'Patrick' seems like most narrated cable documentaries one sees. Narrated by Liam Neeson, the movie is filmed with gorgeous Irish landscape and reinacted reasonably well by little know actors. Separating fact from fiction in the history of St. Patrick's life is their mission. Partly biography experts from historians to authors expound about his life. Fascinating and worthy subject matter, even clocking in at 53 minutes. There are special features as well, including a short interview with author, Frank McCount."
3,Psychedelic Nation,"-Contrasting chaotic and calming sounds- Despite a few weak songs, this group's one and only album is a worthy relic of the 1960s. The United States Of America features ten tracks of synthesized madness and the crystalline voice of Dorothy Moskowitz. If you have any interest in psychedelic music then listening to this album is a must."
4,"Fond memories from the Year Of Great Music, 1968","This album was merely one of many excellent musical overachievements of 1968. The fact that it sunk without a trace is totally beside the point now. At the time it seemed like some intellectual music students had taken lsd and got highly involved with a load of expensive electronic gear and endless studio and rehearsal time. And, oh yeah, they produced a great smart-aleck of an album. It was far out then and is far out now. Just the thing for your college pot party, on the turntable along with Ultimate Spinach, Music From Big Pink, Electric Ladyland, Wheels of Fire, Truth, Crown of Creation, the White Album, ""Wow"" and Kooper / Bloomfield."
4,this music could have been produced with some of today's,"I have often wondered what other people have thought of USA.It is nice to see the nice comments .For the people who are asking where the lead singer is today, I happen to know her and all is well. She is still involved in some sort of music....but that's her business. also , I always thought some of the tracks from this album could be used in some sort of movie. Any interest? In closing, could you imagine Madonna re-recording ""Hard Coming Love"", if not listen to it again........"
4,Loved it 20 yrs ago and love it now.,This album was ahead of its time in that rock was growing up. A snip of the cynical without necessity of guitar-riff-only arranging was a strange-of-pace.
4,Isn't it awful....,"That, oftentimes, exceptional artists only put out one album and then disappear? This is one case, an album that was released on the Columbia label back in the late sixties, right during the ""Summer of Love"", incorporating moogs, therimens and electrified violins, and a very sly-sounding J.A.P. lead singer.This group was everything their contemporaries like Brian Auger, The Jefferson Airplane and others weren't.....VERY indicative of the era it was released in and, except for one mauldlin, pretentious tune by their violinist, has great songs from beginning to end. What might bother some 20th century historians about this album is that there's one song actually deifying a Communist Cuban guerilla icon, Che Guevera, entitled ""Love Song For The Dead Che"". Something tells me this was a parody of the romanticizing of such characters by the left in the late 60s.As a time capsule of what the late sixties were like, musically, attitude-wise and humor-wise, this album has few equals."
2,not what you think,when you go to wash this butter dish you naturally will use hot water since butter is very oily and hot water is all that will get it off. When you do this the blue dye on the dish will melt away leaving you with blue smudges everywhere making the meausrments impossible to read. I was excited about the measuring grid but go with another dish
2,Ink Smears off this Butter Dish,"If the ink on this butter dish didn't bleed after the dish was soaked overnight, I would have given it a better rating. It closes nicely and is much better for the kids than the glass butter dish we previously owned. I'll be looking for a replacement since it's pretty ugly now."
2,The measurement lines are useless.,"When I cut a tablespoon of butter off the dish, the knife also scraped the blue measurement lines off with it. Gross. After washing it once, the remainder of the measurement lines began to disappear. I still use the dish, but I'm looking into purchasing a different one ... preferably one with no dye that could potentially get mixed in our food - maybe some raised measurement lines?"
5,Great everyday butter dish,"My old butter dish that I had had for years broke. When I went to replace it I didn't realize it would be so difficult. It seemed most of the stores only sold the glass butter dishes. Since I already have several glass ones for entertaining, I wasn't in the market for that style. Plus, I wanted one that I could drag from the refriegerator to the stove to the kitchen table. This one is great. It is light weight, very functional with the measurements imprinted on the base, and the top stays on well, but is not difficult to remove. I am very happy with this dish. Who knew a butter dish could make me happy."
2,Flat bottom and Huge,"I returned this item because it had a huge footprint, and a strange design. Rather than sitting in a recess like most butter dishes, this one was on a flat surface that the top sits around. If you were to leave butter out, it would melt onto the table."
1,Disappointment,"I bought two of these because of the measurement marks and because of the good reviews. That was dumb!If the butter stick flies off the plastic bottom and lands on the floor or me one more time, I'm going to take a hammer to it.Other than that, it's fine."
4,"Keeps butter, but a little too big","It was significantly more difficult than I thought it would be to find a plastic butter keeper. I just wanted one I wouldn't break. So, this functions as a butter keeper and has measure guides. It's a breeze to open and close as well.Only drawback: it doesn't fit in the butter compartment of my refrigerator. I have to keep it on another shelf, taking up space. And it is somewhat annoyoning that the only reason it doesn't fit is a small add on to the side of the base that seems like a useless addition. I hope my butter compartment is some unusual nonstandard size (slightly smaller than the length of the product)."
3,BUTTER KEEPER review,"Butter keeper with Meaasure Grid seems to be larger than actually needed, but that is OK. It does not have a lip that surrounds the butter itself so the cube can slide off when uncovered. That would seem to be too small an issue to be concerned about, until the cube does fall on the floor.BUTTER KEEPER with Measure Grid"
1,BLUE INK / PAINT COMES OFF IN THE BUTTER,BLUE INK / PAINT COMES OFF IN THE BUTTER?is it food safestarted 2 mos after purchasenever in dish washer or with other than standard dish soapsI doubt I am using corrosive butter10$ to return $8 itemBLECHH !!!!!!
5,Great butter dish!,"I like this butter dish. It fits inside the compartment in our refrigerator door and I like that it's clear and you can see the butter stick inside it. The measuring marks can be handy at times, too. The lid fits nice and snug so you can lift the dish by the lid and it won't come off. The only thing to comment on is that the bottom, where the butter stick sits, is flat, i.e. no ridge or well to hold the stick in place. So, the butter stick can slide a little on the surface and if you're a bit messy with the butter, the butter can get off the edge of the dish a bit. But, that has not been a problem for us, as we don't see it getting messy enough to matter, and we don't leave our butter sitting out where it could begin to melt and try to run off the bottom. So, we recommend this butter dish as a good one to try if you're in the market for such a thing! We like ours!"
1,Wishing for zero stars - dyed pink butter,"This butter dish dyed the butter in the container pink. I avoided that butter in case the dye was toxic. When I sent a complaint to the seller, I got no response.In addition, like the other reviews said, the butter leaked out when it melted. I have a butter dish shaped stain on my counter. And the markings came off in the first washing."
3,An OK product.,"The main thing I don't like about this product is the lack of a rim, or a textured surface, on the platform to hold the stick of butter or margarine in place. If you are not careful while cutting it the stick will slide right off. Also be careful not to pick it up by the top, even though it has a rubber seal. Another reviewer said that you could, but I have a stick of butter on my kitchen floor that says differently. Otherwise it is OK. The tablespoon marks are a good idea and very useful."
2,Just OK,"I'm afraid this item just isn't sturdy enough.The base of mine broke after about a year of normal use. The lid fits tightly, as advertised, but that means you have to grasp the dish very firmly to pull the lid off. The place on the base I customarily grasped to remove the lid just disintegrated one day. The dish is still usable, but not exactly lovely to look at.Time to replace this one."
3,Color bled on first wash,"I like the idea, but the first time I washed it, the blue coloring bled all over the container, and I wasn't even scrubbing that hard."
2,It's ok,"It's ok, but I wouldn't repurchase. As the other reviews have mentioned, the butter can slide around and the blue measurement ink fades over time. I bought it for the measurements, so I won't be buying it again."
1,Blue ink rubs off!,"I chose this because i liked the measurement lines. Unfortunately, the blue ink on the bottom breaks down from the butter fat, and i had to scrub it off - I don't like the idea of my toddler eating ink, especially from something made in china."
2,ink bled in the dishwasher,"We really like the idea of this butter dish, but the ink bled the first time we washed it in the dishwasher.In our house, if it doesn't survive the dishwasher, it doesn't survive, so it's already in the trash."
2,Celtic Moods CD,Not as good as hoped for - too many bagpipe pieces and not enmough orchestral ones. Also the reproduction of some tracks has a problem over sophisticated stereo equipment.
1,Sony SLV-D100 DVD/VCR combo. IS THIS SONY??,"First let me tell you why I buy this. It's a Sony right. I found out that I was wrong. This lovely Sony SLV-D100 DVD/VCR combo is ACTUALLY made by Samsung Electronics Corporation. This is the electronic corporation that manufactures Go Video VCRs and DVD/VCRs combo. Don't waste your money in buying this. I highly recommend a Samsung or Go Video DVD/VCR combo for less. The brand names may sound funny BUT they perform the same picture, quality, and reliability as the Sony because the two are made by Samsung. How do I know this, try looking at the vcr mechanism and see the similarity of Samsung VCR's design. So don't blame on Sony for this poor design and unreliable product. Sony only designs and markets this DVD/VCR combo and let Samsung Electronics Corporation do the rest. Thanks for reading this review."
2,VCR broke after a few months,"I love the convenience of a combo unit, and I've had no problems with the DVD player. After just a few months, however, the VCR portion of the unit broke down. I play many more DVD's than tapes so this is pretty alarming. The picture looks exactly like what you get when you have dirty heads, so I used the same cleaning method that I use for the other VCR units that I use, (in the kids rooms). I have one of those tapes that you insert and play after putting a few drops of cleaner in it. Well, that didn't fix the problem, (how could the heads really be dirty after a few months of very light use anyway?). Be forewarned about this unit. I bought it since it had good features and didn't have the cheap ""feel"" of the lower priced units available in the market. My mistake. I'm ditching the thing, (will probably hook it up with my kids TV/VCR combo so that he can watch DVD's too), and going with a better brand."
2,Whistle sounds,"I too am being driven crazy by the whistle sound the dvd makes as it's reading the disc. Mine is only 3 days old. I tried all discs and variations of the surround sound/TV, etc to pinpoint the problem. Mine is going back. I think I can only do an exchange and they may not take it (Target return policy) I'll have to ship a 3 day old unit off for repairs. I'll try the exchange and see if it was my unit if they won't take it back.Not really sure I would recommend this product. I wish I had read these reviews first. It's not a glowing report of this product.P.S. I wouldn't know about the remote because I don't seem to get to touch it."
4,Nice,"I was able to immediately save space, and the quality of the product is good. Just got it so, maybe I will love it even more-- thats why I gave it a 4, and the other reason is because of the cost, compared to other DVD/VHS combos."
3,A nother in a herd of combo DVD/VCRs,"I'm Stations here in Germany, a place where PAL doesn't mean friend NTSC which is the system used in America. Germany uses PAL so your VCR must truly be a Multi-System both so the Tuner can decode both. This model doesn't meet my needs so it's just ordinary..."
2,Sony what happened???,"I have always been a sony fan, my entire audio/videosystem are sony products. Let me begin by saying sony rushed thisdeck too fast in production. First the good: The DvD deck is great,the colors are vibrant and the audio is excellent.The vhs deck is ok but misses the mark.The bad: This has to be the worstremote Sony has ever made. Its too small the remote eye isexternalinstead of internal, thats why you have to almost point the stupid thing right at the panel.Why this design I have no ideal.And why should you have to pause the movie just to get the slow motion feature. It would have been nice to have separate slowmotion buttons.It also doesn't have a true step feature.This unit just doesn't hit the mark. It should be around $$and maybe then it would be worth it.I think sony rushed this unitto get into the vcr/dvd combo market. I returned it and willseek another brand."
1,Where's the quality?,"After installing the system, I found the VCR ejecting all my tapes. I Also found that I had to point the remote control exactly at the unit for it to work. I never had experience such a sensitivity in a remote control before.After reading a review on another site that experienced the same problem. I would advise one to require the salesperson to demonstrate that the VCR can actually play a tape before making a purchase. Better yet, I think Sony should trace down the source of this problem and recall the affected units. Isn't there a lemon law for this type of problem?My next attempt will be a JVC as the reviews seem to be good."
1,Junk,"Like other reviewers, I find that the unit is extremely finicky when playing DVDS, to the point of being unwatchable. I have an 8 year old, bottom of the line DVD player that plays better than this. I feel like it was a big waste of money. Since I don't watch a lot of movies, I unfortunately lived with it well beyond the warranty period. Looks like I'll need to junk it. I think rather than go for a combo DVD/VCR, I'm going to go with a DVD Changer, replace my CD Changer, and just plug in an old VCR for those rare times that I'd use it."
1,An Unhappy Customer,"It Had no remote. I called ""Sony Support"" and had to order a ""remote for $47.00. I will never purchase a used item again."
3,"Again, what was the criterion?","There are some things we'll never understand. For instance: what motivated the compilers of this record. Let's start from the beginning: an entire side to Hendrix' minor moments seems to me an undeserved thing. Idem to the Canned Heat tune (12 minutes!). To give space again to Jefferson Airplane, Joan Baez and Butterfield Blues Band, leaving off one single register of the rare to find Incredible String Band (at Woodstock! what a lovely moment it should have been), sounds equally dull to me.Anyway, cheers for the beautiful cover and the CSN&Y tunes."
4,Good TD collection,"I bought this because I was dissatisfied with the sound quality on the intitial GAOW and FL CDs and wanted to see if sound could be improved. It is, but I am expecting the new releases of the first 2 CDs to out do this. Hyperactive the CD is well done. I like how it dispenses with the 2 pop hits at the beginning and then transitions into more moody, melancholy zones. Hyperactive the song and Science may have paid the bills, but moody and melancholy is what Dolby does best."
5,Super Album,This brings back great memories. Thomas Dolby is of the Dolby sound system fame. He does an excellent job showing off his talent with sound effects of the period using his techno-instrument and vocals for a great funky album. His first two songs are likely most familiar to the casual listener but the rest of the album is well worth going through. The first time you might be put off--go ahead and listen another time or two and you'll start hearing some of the sound tricks he does--that for the time was new. Headphones are best for listening. Realize that this was first put out about 25 or so years ago.--Jim Staudenmeier
4,Thomas Dolby got right back in the day,I always Respected the different sounds&Grooves that Thomas Dolby always came up with.She Blinded me with Science alone was a Jam that rocked non-stop.he was always about trying something different.I feel he is very Underrated.he was into different styles&vibes.worth a Listen.
1,Did not work for me,"Purchased and used this stone for grinding primary bevels on plane blades and chisels. I got next to zero cutting from the stone, yet it wore extraordinarily fast. Basically, a complete failure. Not sure if I got a bad stone, but needless to say, I was disappointed."
5,Works like magic....almost,"I have some dull chipped knives. They just are not worth the cost to sharpen them. I had a Chinese cleaver that was so dull, it was a paper weight. This stone is fantastic, especially for the price and size.Soak the stone for 15 minutes, then have plenty of water by you to keep both the stone and the knife wet. It's the slurry that actually sharpens the knife. This is only for knives that have chipped edges or absolutely no edge at all like my cleaver. Take the time to watch some videos on youtube. There are a few different techniques shown, but my favorite was a guy speaking Japanese but you could watch the movements he was making."
2,Unusual ingredients; no pictures!,"Most of the recipes in the cookbook use way too many unusual ingredients. Each recipe requires a trip to the grocery store, and many require trips to specialty stores. Almost all of the recipes are time-consuming and complicated. While there are a few I'm going to try, most are simply not in my ""time budget"" when I get home from work!Also, this cookbook has NO pictures, and I think pictures are very helpful."
2,NOT FOR ME.,"This book was not my cup of tea. It used unusual ingredients and small pots and pans. Quail eggs? My word. The book was just what it said it was, cooking for 2, but not for me. I really did not get really into the book before I discarded it."
3,Less practical than I was anticipating,"I was hoping for classic recipes pared down. This is more upscale. Upscale is nice from time to time, just not what I was anticipating"
3,"Interesting, but just didn't cut it for me.","This is an interesting book, full of appetizing recipes, using regular, fresh and healthy ingredients. Although the author seems to trully understand the need to use ingredients responsibly, many recipes ask for things such as a single rib of celery, or a 1/4 cup of cream. Unless we have a plan for the remainder, we can find ourselves with lots of spoiled food, which is the evil of cooking for only one or two. Also, most recipes have 10-plus ingredients, which means that many times we can't just open the book, pick a recipe and cook. I think that the real turn off for me was the fact that there are no pictures. I love reading cookbooks and pictures really have a way of stimulating my imagination."
2,bjp123,"This book was a huge disappointment. All I was looking for was smaller recipes to cook since my husband retired but this book had recipes calling for things I don't normally keep in my kitchen. Alot of the recipes called for dry vermouth, brandy or rum and how many of you keep quail eggs in the house? I managed to find only three recipes in this book worth trying and then I'm tossing it in Goodwill."
3,Dissapointed,"Although this book has a lot of recipes for two, and is handy in that way, it uses a lot of obscure ingredients I would never have in my kitchen and that are too pricey for my food budget. Since I can't afford over half the ingredients, much less the bakeware to cook them in, I will probably not use this book very much. If you have a high food budget and extensive kitchen setup, this book will be great for you."
5,One of the best cookbooks I have !!,"I received this cookbook about 9 months ago as a gift and have tried at least half the recipes in it and have not found one that my husband and I do not like--seafood, beef, pork, vegetarian, salads, and desserts. All of the flavors blend so well and the portion sizes are just perfect for two. We are empty nesters so the 2 part of the book is of great benefit when we try to rein in our portion sizes.Some of the recipes call for ingredients that may be a little difficult to find in your Mom and Pop grocery store but most higher end super stores have a large selection. Very rarely have I had to substitute an ingredient and I live in the deep south where ethnic food is not usually the highlight of the stores.Most of the recipes can be cooked in 30 minutes to an hour. If you would like to expand your cooking expertise and enjoy simple but wonderfully blended dishes this is the book for you."
5,delicious for two,"i've bought a few books that make recipes for two, and this one is the only one i'm still using. most of the recipes are easy and familiar with a few very interesting dishes mixed in. i couldn't recommed it more highly."
5,Hitch Adapter,Prompt shipping and great product. I was able to use my bike rack with this hitch adapter right away!
1,Image is incorrect,"I can't speak to the product itself as I did not receive what I thought I was ordering, which was several adapters (per the picture). Upon delivery I only received one of the three which is the incorrect size. What was even more frustrating was that upon calling I found out that I have to pay the shipping for the return and a restocking fee of 20%. After venting my frustration they agreed to ship me the correct part but I still have to pay for all the shipping. In the end it would have been cheaper and easier to purchase this part at a local store vs. online."
1,What a letdown,"I practically salivated at learning that Liszt had written a biography of his colleague, Chopin. Upon reading it, I was thoroughly disappointed and stopped halfway through. Essentially, the problem stems from the fact that the narrative is full of verbiage that gives almost no facts about Chopin, but engages in endless verbal diarrhea; it seems that Liszt did not actually write the bulk of the book, but some bimbo who had the reputation of loving to talk at length without actually saying anything.Next time I will buy a real biography of Chopin."
3,Unreliable sources,"The author of this book might be Franz Liszt but I couldn't find who wrote the preface and the date of publishment.Information about the background and the translator's comment also lacking.""Mazourka"" must be mazurka."
1,Life of Chopin or not the life of Chopin.,Life of ChopinThis book was a huge disappointment due to Liszt's lack of objectivity and over-emotional language. Substance is severely lacking and the title of each chapter is not fulfilled.Definitely not recommended.
2,Critic's choice,"Franz Liszt was a great pianist. As a composer, he has a few exquisite works and MANY ornamental works. As an author his biography of Chopin is like his ornamental works whereas it should be more personal and concrete since he was a friend of Chopin, lived in the same city = Paris and was approximately his same age."
3,Lacks the Surface Noise (and the warmth) of the original LP,"Enough Said. The Digital Re-Mastering of this album is a trade off. On the up side, it does not have the surface noise of the original LP, and on the down side, it does not have the warmth of the original LP either. I wish Columbia would see fit to do a 20 bit digital remaster of this album, like they have with so many other albums (and these all sound great, by the way), and possibly try and add some bonus tracks or alternate takes from the same time period, and reissue this album on cd once again, but do it right this time."
3,old stone,"nice to have if you are a stone fan but not worth $50. most songs are mediocre,sounds a little flat,best song-carpet on the floor. this album is availible for around seven bucks if you look hard enough. I just purchased one this week. Hint think nashville."
5,"¡ Muy Bueno !, Very Good !","Soy Carlos desde Chile, America del Sur, quisiera decir es una muy buena compilación de los videos de Genesis. Totalmente recomendable.Atentamente,Im Carlos from Chile, South America, my opinion, the video Genesis compilation, is very good. I recommend its purchase, without a doubt.Best regards,Carlos Rungruangsakorn"
1,Shepperton 1973 Must be the Next Genesis DVD,"This legendary 16mm film has circulated for years among collectors, and it still remains at the best document of the extraordinary Gabriel's era. It's simply one of the most extremely interesting performances I've ever seen, with Gabriel at his best as theatrical frontman, and with such an excellent voice.The entire band is mind-blowing, featuring the truly best ever version of Supper's Ready I've ever had the pleasure to watch and listen to. This gem can't keep hidden anymore!. It's clear it was filmed for an official video. By the way, cameras work is simply astounding. What a difference with the stupid MTV style of the today's DVD's!. Both the filming and performance makes Shepperton 1973 more than a Concert video, rather is a treasure, a document of art at its most unique.Shepperton 1973 has been unequalled. We need it on DVD!NOW NOW NOW NOW ...http://www.saunalahti.fi/~kotti/shepperton/"
1,STOP TRYING TO HIDE PETER GABRIEL'S ERA !!!!!!!,"Who the hell is behind this fraud?. First was that pointless and unforgivable 3 CD collection, filled with mostly Collins POP-GENESIS era, and just the 3rd disc (excellent but totally incomplete, missing statements as Dancing With The Moonlit Knith, Get'Em Out By Friday, Watcher Of The Skies, The Return of the Giant Hogweed, The Fountain of Salmacis, In The Cage, Seven Stonres, Looking For Someone, etc).Now this insult for the long-time fans. A complete excrement. Even it's offensive for both our memory and Gabriel's. Stop praising the crappy 80s era and release a DVD of the Peter Gabriel's era AT LAST !!!. It's not secret at all that there're several films from 1972 onwards, Brussels 1972, NBC studios ""Midnight Special"" 1973, the famous Shepperton 1973 concert, University Sports Arena 1974, ORTF TV Studios 1974, The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway 1975 DVD, etc.Peter Gabriel was the genius of Genesis. PERIOD.We REALLY need a DVD from Gabriel's era instead."
4,"Not bad, could have been better","Iinitially I was excited about adding Genesis' music videos to my DVD collection. However, most of the videos are simply footage of the band playing each song. I was expecting more videos along the lines of ""Land of Confusion"" and ""I Can't Dance."" Still, the quality of the sound and video made it worth the price."
5,HAHA,"Haven't even received product yet, but saw this bit on TV and it's so awesome, I had to buy it!"
5,Aziz is straight comedy.,"Aziz is hilarious, and this DVD will make you a believer. One of the best comedians to date. He is only going to get more popular so you might as well jump on the bandwagon now."
2,"Some laughs, not very interesting","I purchased this dvd based on the reviews but I am dissapointed with the content. There were a few laughs but generally the jokes are about bjs and sex. The Randy bit at the end is highly obnoxious and not at all funny. I agree with another commenter that said Aziz comes off as nervous and not very confident. Some of the jokes go on for too long. Aziz substitutes profanity in places where he could have delivered an intelligent, well thought out joke. He needs more practice and writers with a broader vocabulary."
1,???????????????,"I enjoy this guy on Parks and Recreation, but as a stand-up comic he is astonishingly bad. His is the most uninspired routine I've ever seen. Almost embarrassing."
4,Calling on the spirit of Mitch Hedberg,Funny stuff but at times his phrasing and style is so reminiscent of Mitch Hedberg that it's distracting.Aziz Ansari's dvd special has solid material and he has a good stage presence - just wish he'd drop the Hedberg act. He doesn't need it.
1,Same latch trouble!!,"I agree with several of the people who have written in here. I have used the camera for a grand total of maybe 2 weeks and it is hitting me with the ""Card cover open"" message mentioned in other reviews and it will not do anything else. The small button one needs to push to eject the memory card broke the first time I ejected the card, and as you have read from other reviews here, they will fix it, but for about $100. On to a better camera. Olympus has lost my business as well! AVOID THIS CAMERA."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!,"The battery cover lock broke and now it won't take pictures. I contacted Olympus to order just the cover so I can repair it, and the repair dept. has the parts but they wont sell the parts to consumers. But for about $100, I can send them the camera and they can repair it for me. It costs a little over $100 for the camera I and refuse to pay the same for the repair of the lock. Olympus was apologetic, but not going to be helpful. I am stuck with a non functional camera due to just a broken lock.BEWARE!!"
1,Fatal latch flaw,"I too had the battery cover fail when switching batteries, and ther is no reasonable way to fix the problem. a big waste of money."
1,Bad Design,"I bought this camera and it was only used for 3 weeks before some sensor malfunctioned and now the camera won't take pictures or do anything else becaused it says ""Card-Cover Open"" even thought the card cover is firmly closed and latched. You have to open the card cover to remove the memory card or replace the batteries and since it appears that it is so easily broken, I believe this is a very poor design! Do not buy this camera unless you want to buy another one within a few weeks of use."
5,AWESOME LITTLE CAMERA,Very pleased with my new camera. It's compact with a large viewing screen and an amazing helpful guide. Very user friendly. The video functionality is crisp and clear as well the pictures. I bought this one for work and may buy another for me at home. I highly recommend this one!
3,pocket size with big quality,"I'm happy with my little handy camera. It takes nice pictures and is easy to use. It's also easy to transfer the images to a computer or printer. I gave it 3 stars for the following, it's slow to capture an image, there's like a 1 second delay which makes taking pictures of children and animals pretty tedious if they are moving around.Also you can capture movies but they don't have sound.Other wise a great pocket size camera!"
3,olympus,"nice camera it does its job, btut I am dissapointed because it doenst ahve sound in its videos, unlike what I saw online. Except if Im doing something wrong"
3,Essential Music Videos- Pop Hits,Small selection of Pop hits. I wouldnt call all these songs (pop)- some are R & B. Collection seems a little short with only 6 videos- Overall decent collection.Videos-En Vogue- Free Your Mind from Funky Divas (1992)All-4-One- I swear from All 4 One (1994)Sweet Sensation- If wishes came true from Love Child (1990)Tommy Page- I'll be your everything from Paintings In My Mind (1989)Debbie Gibson- Only in my Dreams (1987)Stacey Q- Two of hearts from Better Than Heaven (1986)Strange video- pretty wierd mixed bag of videos 2.5- 3 stars
2,what hits?,"En Vouge - Free Your mind - I don't like this song too much but the video was pretty good actuallyAll4one- I swear - I haven'y heard this song in a long time, glad to have this video clipSweet Sensation - If wishes came true - This could not have been a pop hit!Never heard this song and the video is a messTommy Page - I'll be Your everything - This is not a hit either, better to listen to YOur cat miauDebbie Gibson - Only in my dreams - tipical 80's song, video, should not be on a DVDStacey Q - Two of hearts - This video is quite silly but I dont mind listing to this songI gave 2 stars for this edition for All4one and Stacey Q. There are so many other really big hits that could have been on this DVD."
4,Only one song i liked,The only video I enjoyed was (En Vogue) Free your mind. En vogue was the most successful girl group during the 90's. All the women were beautiful and talented. Each member had incredible strong vocals with attitude. This song gives out a strong message which made the song such a success throughout the country during that time. The other videos were good but not as good as En Vogues'.
3,Superduty Volante air intake,I must say the quality of the product is 5 stars. However i have not noticed any performance upgrade at all. I am still getting the same gas mileage as well.The best thing i can say is that it is a quick installation and it really looks good under the hood. I have not tried towing my trailer over the pass yet so it may prove its worth at that point i am not sure and i am not holding out hope thus far.Overall i am happy with the looks and quality but not so impressed with the lack of performance.
4,Book On Sexual Regulations,It was good that this book was available for purchase at a reasonable price. Another book related to it is far more expensive.
3,Only Okay,"This books is very much for a total beginner. If you are looking for some great book, this is not it. It deals with the basics only."
2,A waste of Uncle's money!,"My Uncle let me pick out a toy for myself. I picked Digi draw and was so disappointed when I tried to use it. The screens that you have to set up, kept falling. The markers dried up so easily. I have never been able to use it correctly. I end up holding the pictures up to a window, and just tracing it!! I would never recommend this toy."
5,Amazing stories of extraordinary people inside ordinary shel,"This is one of the best books I've ever read, clearly Berlin's best work to date. She writes about cleaning ladies, jockeys, switchboard operators and alcoholics--all with the sensitivity of someone who knows these people from the inside, yet makes no excuses for them. This is no PC attempt at ennobeling them, it's the real thing: fascinating people scrubbing your floors, who possess beauty, insight, charm and plenty of flaws. Real flaws. Real people. Berlin's writing is luscious and poetic, but her real gift is her uncanny ablility to see right through people, communicate what is noteworthy and illuminating in their lives. After 5 years I've read most of these stories, but still haven't quite finished, because I've found myself rationing them. I've read my favorites over and over, but can't bear the thought of having no one left to discover in her world. Apparently her next book is due very soon. Can't wait, it's been so long."
5,Fantastic resource for teaching young writers,"As both an author of novels for young readers (The Nine Pound Hammer: Book 1 of The Clockwork Dark) and a creative writing teacher for upper elementary and middle school students, I've found this book to be an invaluable resource. Baldwin covers a wide range of areas that I know from my own writing practice to be essential--show don't tell, creating purposeful dialogue, planning, hooking readers with strong openings, etc. Baldwin lays it all out in easy-to-use lessons and fun-filled activities. I know I'll mine this book in my creative writing instruction for years to come."
4,Great family film.,"I've always enjoyed animals stories. This is simply a good story. No animals talking, just a narrator telling the story."
2,Incredible Journey,"i ALREADY HAve this movie in VHS,I like this movie and wanted it in DVD form not what I already have.I returned the movie un opensd.This is the 2nd time I have given my in put on this movie."
5,This is the original...and still the best,This is the original incredible journey...the one we all saw when we were kids...and still as charming as ever. I watched this with my 5 and 3 year old last night and they loved it too...the narrator has one of those voices that you just love.
5,Disney's The Incredible Journey,"This is such a great film. The animals are wonderful and for the most part it sticks well to the book. I suppose parts of the book were cut out either for time or production reasons. The ending disappointed me - the book was much better. However, as a film it is wonderful. I think for the price charged there could have been out-takes or some film of how the animals were trained so well but I suppose that is just being picky."
3,on the fence,I think this original version stands up pretty well over time thanks to its heartwarming nature and the incredible cinematography. I grew up on the newer version where you hear the animal's voices and think that in many ways that works as a more entertaining and endearing story. Both are great and it's always fun to pay homage to the original with at least a view.
5,Great movie!,"Very warm, fun, and entertaining. My 3 yr. old son and I watched this for the first time on Disney Channel. My son was thrilled with the movie and I decided to buy it to add to our video collection. Simple and very nice movie for the whole family!"
5,So happy it's come on DVD!,"I saw this film at a drive in theatre with my family when it first came out.I've read the book.I've a VHS copy, and the remake (Homeward Bound) on DVD too.Had often wished I could get it on DVD because I watch it multiple times and am always afraid my tape machine will eat it and it will be lost for good.This is really great and wonderful movie clean throughout and heart-warming. It is told from the animals perpective by a narrator. The cat is the same one used in the original Disney ""THAT DARN CAT"" and the youngest boy appeared in several DIsney movies such as ""OLD YELLER"". I highly suggest that in a world full of ridicule and debasement of morality, virtue and family unity & values, bathroom humour, sexual inuindos, social promiscuity and just plain pornography which passes in today's Hollywood (yes, sorry to say even at Walt Disney Studios) as good clean and wholesome entertainment any one purchase this film while you can."
2,One of the more boring Disney films I've ever seen.,"I am a big Disney film fan, animated or live-action. But this film, 1963's ""The Incredible Journey"" just didn't cut it. During most of the film, there is almost no dialogue except for a boring narration of the story by Rex Allen. I liked the remake, 1993's ""Homeward Bound"", much better because it had human actors doing the voices of the animals. They gave the story a lot more spark, spice, action, and adventure, as well as a lot of humor. I believe that an adventure story with animals needs a lot of action and humor, especially in the case of ""The Incredible Journey"". Unfortunately, this 1963 Disney adventure has virtually no action or humor or even adventure; it's pretty much an extended version of Walt Disney's True-Life nature documentaries he made during the 1950's."
1,Where is it?,"I think I ordered this about 30 days ago and the email said it would ship between 12-17 September, but the DVD still hasn't arrived."
2,Fast food for our McReligion Culture,"I thought the best line for this book came near the very end. ""It's only what you belive will happen and THEREFORE DO next that will bring about life change."" Emphasis on ""therefore do"" was mine. Another way of putting this is ""faith without works is dead."" I believe the writer planned on selling this book as a panacea for people who just want to sit on their butts and recite a prayer and wait for the miracles to start pooring in. I hardly believe there is anythig special about this particular prayer. I think the best solution for anyone is to pray for the strength to do what is right and to let your conscience be your guide. If anyone is hoping to sit on their Lazyboy while reciting a few words to change their life, they will be sorely disapointed. But gee, doesn't it sell?"
3,Don't get the craze,"It boils down to this.Positive: The book emphasizes prayer which is important and most of us need to do more of it. The idea of dissecting these verses and relating them to our everyday lives is a good one.Negative: Prayer is not a guarantee of the good life or ""extreme favor with God"". Its an element to making us spiritually richer but doesn't mean riches or favor. Maybe that's what the craze is all about for this book? If so some will be disappointed."
1,The book help me very much,"I've been a Christian since 15 and just turned 80. I only have known Jabiz' for a few months from a lady's spiritual sharing. Then a mother loaned me this book which was a gift to her teenage daughter who just left it on her desk. Now I am praying Jabiz' prayer regularly and have seen God's response. I also read a commentary on I Chronicle (author: Dr. Peter Au, a Chinese seminary president in Toronto.) written in Chinese and found an scholarly exposition on Jabiz' prayer. I have bought several copies of Prayer of Jabez by Wilkinson and have given them to others. I'll buy more for gifts.,The late author was a gifted expositor. I recommend this book to pastors.Ken Lam, M.D. 1961, Regent College Dip.1984"
1,"Not wooing, but awful biblical interpretation","Wilkinson uses astounding appropriation of a text on how to pray that leaves too much room for self centered self seeking ""expansion of property and wealth"". One would think that if a book is to be written about a biblical prayer as the foundation of a series, that the Lord's prayer would be more appropriate. Complete fantasy and misuse of scripture. If you buy it, read it with a salt shaker handy."
3,Interesting,"I read this book because I had heard so much about it. I was skeptical from the start. I think it has some valid points but I beleive that a full book on four or five lines in ""one of the least read sections"" of the Bible can't help but add to the scripture.I would recomend the book to Christians and those who would like to see how a certian segment of the Christian religion thinks."
5,Let the Man of God Do What God Wills,"Hello: We have been praying this prayer as a church for several months. The results are as many would say phenominal but as my husband and I would say, not phenominal just God. We as believers need to step out and take what God has for us. If it takes a book or a pamphlet or whatever... Let God do His Work and let us remember that He is God and we're not."
3,"A Good Beginning, But","this book should point the reader onward to Malachi 3:10 where the true secret of prosperity is in the Bible for all who dare to take God up on His financial challenge. Overall, the Prayer of Jabez certainly did work for Jabez and is a good start for those not familiar with the Bible or its promises. The book is easy to read. I do recommend the book. - James Russell, Author of the Christian devotional book, ""Walking With The Lord."""
4,Response to Mr. Rick Rauser......,"In my opinion, I believe that Wilkerson was not trying to get his readers to 'manipulate God to serve our desires.' On the contrary, I believe his intentions were to open our eyes to the blessings that we fail to recognize each day from God. Wilkerson made it very clear that we can only receive these blessings when we are in unity with God's desire for us. In other words, only when God's will is in action, will we perceive the blessings that that unity reflects. Wilkerson mention that this prayer is not suggesting to pray for a new car, house etc. But, Pray for things that are not specific and God will add unto you as he desires...and the prayer goes into more depth, but others will have to read it..."
1,Read the Bible instead!!!,"I'm ashamed to see Christians embracing this book. I'm ashamed at how many sequels this book has spawned - Jabez for women, Jabez for teens, Jabez for teachers. This is riduculous. This book displays one of the biggest problems in Christianity - that people use the Bible to justify whatever they want life to be instead of using the truth of God's Word to guide their lives to His will. I only gave this book one star because zero stars wasn't an option."
1,Not Worth The Money,"Starting a new religion? Why not write totally worthless dreck about a very few lines in the Bible. It reads like a very boring Sunday Sermon given by a fool who needs to impress himself. If you want inspiration read the Good Book, or the Quaran, or the teachings of the Dali Lama. Don't waste your money on this one!"
1,"Me, My, Me, Me, I","Why are people still reading this book and saying this prayer?Don't you think that referring to yourself five times in such a short prayer sounds selfish? Do you think that is what God wants? It may work for a while (just like a sugar pill)because people will concentrate on increasing their wealth and influence. But it does not address the underlying problem of the need for forgiveness of our sins and our obligation to help & pray for others and to honor & pay homage to the God who makes all possible (that is his will). If you want to know how to pray, the best place to start is Matthew 6:9-13 and Luke 11:2-4. The disciples asked Jesus how to pray and he taught them what most call the Lord's Prayer, but I like to call The Prayer of Jesus. An excellent book on the subject is ""Praying Like Jesus"" by James Mulholland. There are many book that are about or contain discussions of every word of this wonderful prayer."
2,Would you like some fries with your Prayer of Jabez?,"I have to say ""thumbs down"" for the Prayer of Jabez.In a fast-food culture that is already bent on over-consumption, urban-sprawl and ""me-ism"", it seems the last thing Americans need is a book about ""expanding our territory"".Certainly there are many good principles in this book. It is right to ask God to ""expand our territory"" in order to have a positive impact on the lives of other people, but I highly doubt this is what Jabez had in mind.Wilkinson reads far too much into a very obscure passage of scripture and even uses a less-common translation in order to emphasis the phrase: ""that I may not cause pain"" -- which appears to promote a more noble image of Jabez. Every other major translation has the subject and object in the reverse order: ""that it may not cause ME pain."".Wilkinson would have done much better with ""The Lords Prayer"". At least here, God (and not ""me"") is placed at the center."
5,This book was profoundly productive for me,"I had issues of deservability for years. No matter what therapy or spiritual path, I had an underlying sense I was not worthy of success and the good life. Someone recommended I get this book to help me in improving my business. I was skeptical, very, and I am not and do not want to become a Christian (no comments on that please). But I figured I would try the book out, and see if my life could improve. The book was a VERY easy read, and it really made me take a look at what I really did believe. I have had enormous success since incorporating this prayer into my life. I am still not a Christian, nor do I want to be, but this guy made great sense and it has improved all areas of my life to pray this prayer. I am very grateful for the suggestion to read it!"
1,The Cult of Jabez,"All pseudo-Christian cults have one thing in common. They all claim to have ""uncovered"" some ""hidden"" or ""secret"" teaching or verse buried in the Bible.The Prayer of Jabez, by Bruce H. Wilkinson is no different. The author of the popular Jabez books would have us to believe that he has uncovered a powerful prayer, that when recited ""word for word for thirty days"" or more ""releases God's power, favor, and protection""? This is so far from Biblical Christian teaching that one would wonder how any professing believer could fall for it. But you know Jesus warned us that in the last days many false teachers would arise and ""seduce, if it were possible, the very elect (believers)"". On February 1st, 2002 a book will be released worldwide that exposes the dark teachings of the Wilkinson's ""Jabez Revolution"", as he calls it. ""The Cult of Jabez"" will be available to Amazon customers soon. Check it out!"
1,The Prayer of Jabez,"The book is a book of mixed messages. In one message the author tries to draw a person ""to let go and let God though prayer""; but, then the author offers a game plan -- ""If you say this, God will do that"". This game turns God into a vending machine."
1,Very Dissapointed,"This book included some principles which are very true and powerful but in my opinion, mixes with them enough error to be more of a stumbling block, than a tool for motivation and growth. By all means, pursue the topic of prayer! It will change your life! But try reading Olan Hallesby or E.M. Bounds instead. These books are thoroughly good and trustworthy and have stood the test of time."
2,I tried but didnt get it ...,"I promised myself I'd read this for a dear friend who asked me when he was passing away. I kept my promise, almost. I read 75% of it but never really got the prayer deal other than bless me and bless me some more. Sorry folks but I dont see what the hoopla is about?"
3,Pray of Jabez,"I did read it and found it ok, but any Christian that reads the Bible knows that God wants to bless His children....the Bible is full of blessings, all we need to do is recieve them, ask for them, walk in it....they are there. It is good sometime to be reminded of this, that is why we should read some in the Bible every day, to be reminded...God is good all the time, and if we are His children, He delights in pouring His blessings on us. Not just in money, but in health to. It is a blessing from God to have good health today. Kay"
5,Awesome doctrine!!!,"Incredible little book....can really excite you for the work of the Lord Jesus Christ. A ""MUST read"", if you feel you are at a dead end street."
1,Wants God to be a Genie in a BOTTLE!!!!!,"I would suggest to Wilkinson that all the money that he is making from writing this book should be well spent trying to make amends with THE IMUTABLE GOD in heaven. Try looking at the second commandment: Though shalt not make a graven image! God is made into a NEW image here. Do not be fooled. This life is but a breath. This book isn't going to help any person get into the kingdom of God, it will destroy you! God OWES YOU NOTHING! He bought those who serve him with a price. WE owe HIM everything! Try to write a book now explaining why God really isn't a Genie to pull out when you selfishly want something. GOD made us for HIS GLORY not OUR pocketbook. We are here to get ready to Marry our glorious God in Heaven. I do not know of many husbandmen who looked for someone selfish to marry. GET your oil lamps ready!!! Look away from yourself and on to the glorious savior and EVERLASTING GOD."
1,poor theology,Dr. wilkenson should know better. I have to seriously question this mans knowledge of scripture.
3,Nothing selfish in the content of this book,"The customers who have reviewed this book negatively and said that it is about selfishness obviously have not read the book. Or they have not read it carefully. The prayer in this small book is simply about opening oneself to what GOD wants and intends for us. Period. The biblical passage on which the book is based simply points out that we humans (who have free will) have to ASK for God's blessings. The prayer is simply a variation of ""Ask and ye shall receive"" or ""God helps those that help themselves."" I can't imagine what some of the fearful book reviewers find so scary or unorthodox in that. There's nothing new in the idea. It is supported by Scripture! This book is a lovely reminder that our Father waits to bestow blessings -- if we ASK."
1,Far less than one star,"This book is so full of biblical error that one is at a lost as to where to begin giving a proper and fair critique. This book may be an indication of the excessive biblical illiteracy of many (Or rather most) people. What concerns me most is that this book also seems to be a run-a-way best seller among those who claim to ""know"" Christ. It doesn't suprise me that unbelievers are so gullible; but Christians? Lord help us."
1,Another get rich quick scheme,"There are only two reasons a person would buy a religious book, either he desires to learn more about religion in an academic sense or he is hoping to find himself spiritually. This book fails to deliver on both accounts. Academically, there is no serious study. I read the book in twenty minutes it's that short, hardly worth the ten dollar price. If you are looking for spiritual enlightenment I suggest you consult the Bible, Koran or the Vedas. Basically, he says repeat this line all the time and all your problems are solved. Furthermore, at the end he says oh yeah if I didn't rip you off enough all ready send me some more money at this address."
3,"Good message, poorly communicated","There is controversy about whether this book supports the unscriptural ""prosperity gospel."" And on balance, it doesn't. But either Wilkinson or his editors have opened themselves to that criticism by their carelessness presentation. On balance, the message is a plea for the Christian to ask God for more opportunities to serve Him, and a reassurance that He will supply supernatural resources for those who ask. But there's enough emphasis on getting earthly blessings to upset the modern-day Pharisee, unfortunately. Secrets of the Vine was much better."
1,A Prayer for More Money,I find it repugnant that Bruce H. Wilkinson is legitimizing people's desire to pray for personal success. Of course the book is flying off the shelves. Suddenly people do not need to feel guilty any more about being greedy pigs.
5,Prayer is Key,This book demonstrates the importance of prayer for spiritual maturity. Prayer unlocks Christs love for us. How amazing that such a small text contains so much vital information. A must read. Also if you like Left Behind read Apocalypse South by Kyle Watson its very entertaining.
3,Prosperity Gospel?,"I read this little book a couple of times nearly a decade ago when it was extremely popular in the States. The Prayer of Jabez was a #1 New York Times Bestseller that attempts to show readers how to ask for a life of abundant impact and significance for God. Jabez was more honorable than his brothers and asked our Heavenly Father for territorial gain and spiritual blessing. There are over 500 names in 1 Chronicles, and only Jabez receives the special comment of a request being made and granted. Our Father wants to shower us with His gifts. We unlock change in our lives and in our world when we choose to do what He wants in His way. We simply need to ask. It should be noted that many conservative evangelicals (which could describe myself) feel Wilkinson's interpretation of 1 Chronicles 4:9-10 is a form of prosperity gospel. When I read this as a new believer years ago, I felt even then that this book treated the King of Kings almost like a genie in a bottle."
4,Inspiring & eye-opening,"I agree with the author's theory that there must be a reason that Jabez's prayer is included in the bible. I was one of those who felt I shouldn't ask for much, that there was a tally card up in heaven keeping score of how many favors I had requested.The bible, however, tells us differently. This is not being selfish as some churches have complained about this book because when you pray the prayer you are asking for God, in His infinite wisdom to bless you with what HE wants for you and so that you can help others. Bruce Wilkinson makes this very clear.This book helped me to not be afraid to ask. I have recommended it to others and I would suggest after reading it to purchase the companion Prayer of Jabez Devotional as well!"
1,Why this prayer?,"I think we are missing the boat if we put SUCH great significance and focus on a few lines of a prayer in the old testament, then add our own interpretation to a prayer that seems pretty simple to decipher. Let us focus on what Jesus tells us. I for one feel that this work provides an excuse to ask for material things and find ""proof"" that we have the right to pray for that. The desire for material things is a human one, which I believe God understands, and forgives. However, as Christians, don't we wish to aspire to find joy from whatever God wills us? Funny how many ""Christian"" reviewers defend this book, and seem to loose focus on the Bible and especially, the direct guidance from Jesus in the New Testament. Also funny that the popularity of this book is going help answer the prayer for expanded territory of it's author."
3,It's what you make of it.,"I enjoyed Jabez much. I thought that it challenged disciples to examine their prayer life. It offered insight and exposed a common lack of expectation of God's blessings. I am disappointed with what I think Wilkinson is purposing: Praying a four line prayer. He never explains that prayer is an open of our heart to God and that this prayer can be used as an outline. There are a few implications that the prayer is just an outline, but he makes just as many implications to merely pray the four lines. I fear for the people that read this book and then ritualistically recite the four lines every morning. On the other hand, if someone that realises that the prayers in the bible are outlines, if that person reads this book, their prayer life, and walk with God in general, will be lifted to a new level. For more mature disciples who will easily see through the ritualism, this is a great book. For the inexperienced Christian, I would recommend buying a new Bible, NIV, perhaps."
1,False Teaching and misleading.,"Discovering a 'secret' prayer, a one liner that will score with God, as BW asserts, is the first tip off that this book is from the pit. It caters to those who want to 'use' God on their terms and get the goodies. No wonder its a best seller. But it's also a misuse of scripture. I hope people will be tipped off to this spiritual poison before they start wasting time following its advice. What amazes me is that BW wrote it. I gave it one star because there was no lower option."
1,Forcing God to do your will,"Christianity today is after power and self fulfillment and to corner that market we have a book here that offers us a magical incantation in which all you have to do is to repeat this prayer over and over and SHAZAM.....God blesses you.Does this sound like vain repetitions which many think that they will be what it takes to get from God what they want. HMMMMM. Jesus had no place to lay his head, Paul was a prisoner in a dungeon who paid with his life, early Christians were killed in the lions den. To bad they didnt pray this prayer.They could have had health and wealth and all the good stuff that God will surely bless us with!"
1,This book stinks. I'm still not wealthy or powerful!,"I prayed for a million dollars, a promotion and a political seat of power. I still can't believe God didn't answer my prayers. Wilkinson's instructions must be flawed. I know God would never intentionally ignore my selfless request because I'm a Christian."
5,A Powerful Little Book!,"The prayer of Jabez highlights a seemingly insignificant notation regarding a man whose prayer changed his life. This is not a book about selfish ambition through spirituality. Bruce Wilkinson rightly asserts that greatness in God involves becoming aligned with the greater purposes of God to bless others. This prayer, as with most prayer, changes the pray-er more than the situations surrounding him or her.A must read book!"
2,Faulty Theology,"Although there are some merits in this book, such as elements of prayer and being where God wants you to be, the whole thrust of this book tends to be built around one Bible verse, and allegedly it has brought wealth, prosperity and health to its author. This is unfortunate, because the author is highly respected, and here he is, marketing this incredible series to make an incredible amount of money. Maybe he should read Jim Bakker's ""I Was Wrong,"" and get some tips."
1,Not a sound business investment,"I bought this book in December 2000 and began applying its principles faithfully in my life. In the five months that followed, my business lost over $500,000 in revenues and went into the red for the first time in its thirteen year history. We had to let several people go, and one of them (who was a dear personal friend of mine) committed suicide after she got laid off. I stopped praying the Prayer of Jabez around the middle of April. Since then, business has been steadily increasing and we've even hired three new people.I don't know if this is just coincidence, or God's way of telling me not to call on his name just to satisfy my own greed. Either way, I'd recommend skipping this book. It's just not a sound business investment."
2,What would Jesus say...,"I am surprized that when ask by the disciples, ""Lord, Teach us to Pray"" Jesus just didn't refer them to the Prayer of Jabez. Instead he taught them what we've come to know as ""The Lords Prayer"" and in doing so instructed that prayer is to be directed to God, in Praise and Worship as opposed to commanding the God of the Universe to do simple things for the Plyaint."
4,The Prayer of Jabez...,It is a very interesting book. It is very helpful in several areas. It is best read in daily increments.
1,prayer of Jabez..to who?,"The prayer of Jabez does not focus on our need for salvation through Jesus Christ. Everyday pray the prayer Jesus taught us to pray, the Lord's Prayer, not the prayer of Jabez. Also, when we sin, Wilkinson mentions we need to make it right with God. We do not. Christ has done that for us. There is nothing we can do, nothing we need to add to what Jesus did on the cross. The Prayer of Jabez is based on an inaccurate translation. Jabez was not necessarily an honorable man, the translation should read Jabez was honored above his brothers. This does not necessarily make him honorable."
1,Typical Health and wellness Christian View.,"This book is 93 pages of drivel. It would seem that Wilkinson has received an answer to his prayer....Look at all the marketing rights there are to this book. This one book has spawned devotionals, calendars, Prayer of Jabez for teens...Next we will see Prayer of Jabez for the mentally challenged, Seniors etc. ITS MARKETING AND CAPITALISM GONE WILD.Now to my actual criticism of the book. The book seems to be telling the reader that by praying this prayer, one will all of a sudden be brought into a world of overwhelming blessing. Wilkinson gives the impression that this prayer is like a spiritual American express card, giving both worldly and divine riches. Maybe instead of sending foreign aid to countries we should just send copies of the prayer of Jabez...But seriously, the one prayer that we should add to our daily supplications to the Lord is the Lord's prayer. And as it happends this prayer is free."
4,"O h, R e e e e a a l l l l l y ? ? ? ? ! ! ! !","I offer you a quote,""L e t n o m a n j u d g e, L e s t y e b e j u d g e d.""is that accurate enough for you?Let us all, do unto others as we wouldhave them do unto ourselves.Search for the good in a creationand offer praise of it's merits."
4,Inspiring challenge!,"What a book! I approached this book hesitantly, both because I was wary of its fad-like appeal and worried I'd find a ""blab-it, grab-it"" type of spirituality. It's neither. Wilkinson's work is an inspiring reminder that we serve a BIG God and our prayers ought to be big too. He clearly states that God's in control of answering prayer.Other reviewers object to Wilkinson's not offering a thorough analysis of prayer, but he never promised to. As the title of the book indicates, this book is about the prayer of Jabez. It's a quick read and a terrific challenge."
5,A Life Changing Experience,"Prayer of Jabez is a great book to help you pray in such a way that is more effective. It actually works, you'll be amazed."
1,"God doesn't need us, we need God...","Paul warns us to not build a belief on mere speculation. Luke quotes Paul in Acts as saying to be on the guard for ""grevious wolves"" This, along with the Left Behind series are merely that, speculation, and false teaching. If you want to build a belief system on a few verses, why not try promoting canabalism by quoting Revelation 19:17-19? I had a friend tell me once that more often than not if a book or movement in Christianity becomes extreme popular, or mainstream, that it, as Steve Brown says, smells like smoke (i.e. it's from the Devil). Be aware when reading any ""Christian"" literature, fiction, non fiction, etc. Do as the people in cities where Paul preached did, search the scriptures, see if it's true. Don't rely only on the words and thoughts of mortal man."
5,Outstanding call to Spiritual Renewal!,"Because I considered this book such an excellent call to Spiritual Renewal, I purchased ten copies, kept one and gave nine to family and dear friends (some new Christians and some not-so-new). This was following a recommendation from a close friend and prayer partner. I was also inspired to write a song using the scripture as my guide."
2,The real prayer,"Nice idea, nice prayer; unfortunately, that's not how it reads in Hebrew. It would behoove CHristian authors to use a knowledgable translation -- such as the Stone TaNaCh. We Jews have been reading it for 3000 years."
5,For Tracy from Indiana,"I will make this really short - and truly from a gentle and loving heart. One cannot understand the Bible with a natural comprehension. It was written supernaturally - and must be interpreted supernaturally to us as we read it. How you interpreted Jabez' prayer is not at all what God was saying. I guess that I would say that I truly desire for you to have a personal relationship with Jesus Christ - then God, the Holy Spirt will reveal to you the Scripture. Dawn, from Providence"
1,Have you checked the cross-reference to 1 Chronicle 4:10,"Deut 12:20 gives some real insight to the prayer of Jabez. It appears that this son of Judah (1 Chron 4:1) was concerned with the promise of the God of Israel to widen out territory, i.e., increase in worshipers of true God. Deut 12:1,2 shows that the cleansing of the land from pagan worship would result in widening it out, all with God's blessing. Jabez's motive was pure in that he was concerned, apparently, with making more true worshipers. So, perhaps the lesson that is really derived from this Hebrew scripture account is for Christians to pray to be successful in making more disciples of Christ, as Jabez wanted to make disciples for God, in a peaceful way. Sounds like an honorable mission indeed."
1,This one really doesn't rate,"Incredible what we find as substitutes for God's inspired written word. Not that Mr. Wilkinson has written a terrible book, it is simply an unnecessary one. Stay focused. Read and re-read the BIBLE2 Corinthians 5:1-9"
1,"You gotta be kidding, right???!!??","I am still not sure if this book is a joke. I didn't know whether to laugh at its clever irony or cry at its cruel exploitation. Can anyone seriously believe the Old Testament contains an incantation that makes its chanter wealthy? The poor and unintelligent should stop believing in nonsense like this (and lotteries), and realize that they have to work to make money. Authors like the self-styled ""Doctor"" Wilkinson are hypocrites for preying on the gullible to make themselves rich."
1,There needs to be a Zero star rating for books like this,"I wonder what Bruce Wilkinson was thinking when he wrote this book. There is no way a top-notch theologian could squeeze 96 pages out of one verse and keep it focused solely on Scripture. Well, Wilkinson wrote that much, but he threw in so many examples from life that it totally took away the meaning of the verse.If John Owen and Matthew Henry were alive today, I wonder how much they could have written on just that one verse. Both of those men knew how to rightly divide the Word of Truth. Wilkinson does not appear to know this."
2,poor exegesis,"For approximately 3500 years the Prayer of Jabez has been virtually ignored by scholars in both the Jewish and Christian communities. Now along comes Wilkinson who writes as if he has discovered some new secret to prayer. Jesus, in his introduction to the Lord's Prayer (Luke 11:2), said, ""When you pray, say; ... "". This prayer was given to his followers as an example of how to pray. The Prayer of Jabez was given to Jabez only, no one else. Any attempt to make this prayer universal, especially when it comes to increasing one's borders, spiritual or not, is poor exegesis."
1,Sugar Coated Theology,"After careful study of this book I have found that it is not only thelogically emptey but it uses a minority translation to establish its premise. That somehow this prayer which is not found in any of the Lord Jesus's discourse on Prayer is a wonderous solution for getting closer to God. If so, then why, when Jesus's disciples asked Him to teach them to pray did He not just say, ""He guys, go with the Prayer of Jabez."" A better book by far, is written by Mike Nappa, ""The Prayer of Jesus"". If you want to get closer to God get Mr. Nappa's book and read it alongside your Bible. If you want to waste your time on trivia read the Prayer of Jabez but don't use your Bible alongside it, there will be an obvious lack of truth involved in comparing it to the Scriptures. You may have to order Mr. Nappa's book but it is well worth it. If you want empety sugar coated theology get the Jabez book, if you want ""Meat and Potatoes"" substance stay away from it and order Prayer of Jesus by Nappa."
1,American Christianity for a Dollar At It's Best,"Hey I think I'll buy the prayer of jabez wallet or the journal, or the watchband, or the prayer of jabez study guide or the prayer of jabez lamp.Give me a break...our American Christianity is a joke...it's all trying to make a buck...look at the christian bookstores...they'll try to cash in on anything...If Jesus walked into one of them, He'd overturn all the tables...just like He did in the temple"
1,Less than one star,"Many years ago, when I struggled in the throes of alcoholism I would have clasped this book to my bosom like a drowning person clasps a life saver. These type of books are very misleading, they encourage seeking after ""cheap grace"" and they totally ignore the Christian message of love and service toward others. This is a very bad, fast-food type religious book based on very shaky scholarship and is an example of what Fundamentalists like so much to do -- proof texting -- using one example to bolster an argument even if that example goes against the tenor of the whole work. Not worth the money or the time to read it."
1,Unbiblical teaching,"I strongly disliked Bruce Wilkinson's book. He makes it sound like God is our ""sugar-daddy"". We simply need to place our order with him, then God will 'grant us our wish'. Where does it tell us that in the Bible? Where does the Bible say that when man prays, he always gets exactly what he wants? I think Bruce Wilkinson needs to label his book what it is: a work of fiction. Better yet, he needs to quit writing books until he becomes well versed in the scriptures."
4,"""That I may not cause pain""","After reading Mr.Wilkinson's views on The Prayer of Jabez: etc., I found it to be very thought provoking. I enjoyed it very much for the most part, but there is something that truly bothered me. Being one who has both caused and endured a lot of pain in my own life, I found it odd and questionable that he would not even discuss the part of the prayer that is most important to me. ""That I may not cause pain."" To me, it is a little arrogant if not sad to overlook one of life's most important principles and foundations of the Christian religion. The ""Golden Rule "" I learned as a child is applicable here. The mere fact that Jabez included these words in his prayer tells us how important they are! To not cause pain to anyone is a lofty ideal worth the effort and prayer it requires to accomplish. Thank you to Mr. Wilkinson for his book and keep up the good work. glb"
1,A Poor Effort,"As a fan of Bruce Wilkerson (having used some of his other material), I am very disappointed with this effort. Bruce should know better. Exhorting Christians to copy one of the most self-centered prayers of a tragic Old Testament character, is a mistake. That the book has commercially prospered and spawned an entire 'Jabez' franchise in our shallow, self-centered, Christian pop culture is hardly a surprise. The theology represented in this book will only fly in propserous Western cultures. The book appeals to the absolute worst element in all of us . . .""how to get the 'secret' key to prosperity"". The Prayer of Jabez is little more than warmed over, self-improvement, pop psychology dressed in Christian lingo. Avoid this book. If you want self-improvement, get the real thing and buy from Tony Robbins or Dale Carnegie."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"""The Prayer of Jabez"" was given to me today. I read it cover to cover, in one sitting. This little book is full of truth about the life of powerful prayer. I have experienced times in my life when there was no doubt that God was working through me, but I never found a common-thread connection between them. This book clearly lays out the Biblical principles of prayer that go hand-in-hand with such a God-filled life - a life that is undeniably used by God to touch the lives of others. Dr. Wilkinson has explained more clearly than anyone I have ever read, or heard, the application of these principles. Get this book, read it, apply it - you will never be the same. One additional note - ""Fresh Wind, Fresh Fire"" is an excellent book about the importance of prayer. ""The Prayer of Jebez"" is more about how to pray. To me, the ""how to"" book is far more valuable. I hope you will get this book and let God work through you as you have never allowed Him to before."
5,Success for Christian,"This is a book giving you the keys that Jabez had in serving Jesus. It's not just a book with a formula or selfish ideas to prosper Christians. Also,in the book of Psalms God says he wants to prosper Christians. The book is telling us how God will prosper us in every area of our life. Not just material. Prayer of Jabez focuses on expanding our witnessing territory. Christians who obey God can prosper in his will. God wants to reach all people. David,Moses,Elijah,and others know the prayer of Jabez. If you like Left Behind you will like {Apocalypse South}by Kyle Watson on amazon.com."
1,"Jabez, A prayer for gain ""and enlarge my territory, """,Who lived in the territory that this greedy JABEZ wanted HMMM?
1,Jabez..ok....but what happened to Jesus?,"Maybe it is a sign of our times. I have been working with either selling, writing, editing or publishing Christian books for over 25 years. As Christian books have become big business, it is sad to see solid, upbuilding Christian books which lift up the name of Jesus pushed aside in favor of those which have a faddish, flash popularity.Dear ones, for me prayer is first, foremost and always about JESUS. Eph. 3:20-21"
5,A Little Book with a Big Message,"Who would have thought that such a small book could have an impact on so many lives. The Prayer of Jabez packs a powerful message in a book that can be read in just one sitting.Wilkinson takes a scripture that has been overlooked countless times. Hidden in Chronicles in the midst of genealogical lists, we find a small description of one man. One man, who stood out in God's eyes. This man gave a small prayer that can teach millions how to pray.The Prayer of Jabez takes an insightful look at this scripture and how you can apply it to your life. Wilkinson shows how one little prayer can bring down God's blessings to those who call out to Him. You will be inspired."
1,Wish I could put -5 Stars..........................,"Uh, Bruce..............Remember Jesus? I don't think praying for personal success was anywhere at the top of His list.You are one scarey Christian."
1,Reminds me of Twain,"Remember Huck's ruminations about prayer? Miss Watson said ""pray all the time, get this that & the other thing"". Huck wondered why nobody ever got anything they could sell at the market. The Widow Douglas said ""Pray for spiritual gifts."" Huck decided to let it go.Read Huckleberry Finn. Don't waste your money or time on this hick religiosity."
1,Just a suggestion.,"May I humbly suggest a book called ""The prayer of Jesus"" by our old friend Hank at the CRI.While this book frustrates me as a Christian, I do appreciate its call to prayer. Much has been written about this book and Hank perhaps says it best by reminding us that when asked to show us how now to pray, Jesus chose the lord's prayer. His prayer. Not David's or Jabez's. He chose his. I recommend Hank's book in place of this one and others like it. God is not a cosmic bell hop, He is our God and his will be done in our lives on his time, not ours. To discern God's will, we must want it more than anything else in our lives. Not a quick prayer mantra. Just my opinion. I stand down."
1,Extrapolation,"There is a word for the proper approach to scriptural interpretation. It is exegesis. This book plays fast and loose with its ""exegesis."""
3,Don't limit your prayer life with this prayer...,"I like Wilkinson's writing style. It's interesting and comfortable. But I have doubts about the real intent of the book. If it is to encourage people to seek God, if it is a way of reaching the unchurched, if it was created to be a type of evangelism tool, then I would have no problem. But, my concern is that people will stop with this book. And if God doesn't answer their prayer, they will stop seeking Him. Americans just have a hard time realizing that God and most of the world isn't American also. I hate fads and I hate hype, and I am not sure this book promotes ""the long haul"". But, if in some way it leads the reader to desire a deeper relationship with God, I applaud. But I question whether or not it does."
3,For the most part... I think I liked it,"I read this book with a questionable eye, and am still digesting it's contents. However, I admit that I did learn a lot from the author's explanations of the different portions of the prayer. I'm going to try praying the prayer, but at the same time ask God to give me insight and wisdom as to whether or not it's ""proper"" to ask these things. I don't know. This book gave me a deeper yearning to exercise faith, and trust that God is capable and strong enough to handle all things. So that's definitely a good thing..."
5,From a former skeptic,"As many, I was initially skeptical about this book and refused to read it. I have now read it and had the opportunity to hear Dr. Wilkinson himself in a Prayer of Jabez conference. Truly there have been many misconceptions to his book, many spurned by envy or unbelief.The amazing thing about this little book is not that the idea itself is revolutionary, but that it opens our eyes to a message that has been taught in the Bible many times: ""We have not, because we ask not"". The Prayer of Jabez teaches us a wonderful way to ASK; not for what WE want, but for what GOD wants for us. To ask for God's blessing is to ask for what He desires to give us. The book does not encourage us to forget all other prayer, but to include this into our daily prayers.I encourage all christians to read this book, to open their eyes to the amazing mercies of our Father who wants to bless us beyond our wildest imagination!"
3,A pop Christianity book that should be read with caution,"Bruce Wilkinson is to be commended for bringing an obscure figure from the Old Testament into focus, because Jabez really is a remarkable man who overcame much to enter into God's blessings. And I am touched by the way the Lord has used this prayer in Wilkinson's own life. But I feel that the author has co-opted this prayer and has turned it into almost a formula for how to get God's blessing on your life, and I'm not sure that this is the way I take the prayer. The book is written almost like an infomercial: If you do 'this,' God will do 'this,' and you will experience 'this.'The fact of the matter is that many people all over the world have prayed prayers much like the prayer of Jabez, and have not always had the same experience. Read any of Phil Yancey's books, and you'll see lots of examples of Christians who have experienced this kind of disappointment with God.So read this book with caution and care."
1,Shocking that people are so easily led!,"It saddens me to no end that people fall into line and accept without scrutiny whatever is popular. From the beginning, this book demands answers, that I feel Mr. Wilkinson cannot or will not give. One of the beginning sentences is . . .""I am going to teach you to pray a prayer, which when prayed every day, God always answers"". WHAT??!! Is this voodoo chanting, or what? Since when is the only acceptable answer from God a yes? My parents raised me to understand that yes, no and later were all answers. Perhaps Mr. Wilkinson should learn this as well."
1,Breaking Through -- Really? For How Long?,"Some people have been saying, ""Hey, it's gotten people to pray, so leave it alone"" or ""It's working, so what is wrong?"" I think this is good that more people are praying, but how long will it last when it is based on faulty ideas about God and prayer..."
1,dangerous content,"I had heard so much about this little book, and all of my friends highly recommended it to me. I was leery at first on account of all the hype, but was open to what Dr. Wilkinson had to say.Wilkinson says in the preface ""I want to teach you to pray a daring prayer that God always answers."" Since when does God not always answer our prayers. Is this to imply that there are some prayers that God does not answer.In the second chapter he says ""His [God's] kindness in recording Jabez's story in the Bible is proof that it's not who you are, or what your parents decided for you, or what you were ""fated"" to be that counts. What counts is knowing who YOU want to be and asking for it."" Since when has Scripture been about us? There are many other red flags that if I had more space I would raise, but I must strongly discourage the reading of such ""name it claim it"" propaganda.Above all, we must pray ""...Thy will be done..."""
2,Let's Quote It Right!,"My fiancee and I read this book together over the phone. We found it valuable for enlightenment and discussion, thought and prayer. However, the book is seriously flawed, in that it misquotes the Bible.The correct quotation is ""...keep me from evil, that it might not harm me."" The mistaken quotation, ""...keep me from evil, that I might do no harm,"" is a different meaning."
5,Ask God for the World,"Exploring Jabez was a wonderful adventure. I am an infant in my walk, but I know when I have favor with God. This is one of the few non-relationship Christian books I have read. 96 pages filled with how you can inherit blessings from God and not feel guilty about asking for more.If you are looking to be blessed commit to the prayer on a daily/regular basis, and watch his power move into your life."
5,The Prayer of Jabez: Breakthrough to the Blessed Life,"This is a brilliant and insightful book that is written by someone whom is living a yeilded life to Our Lord and Saviour Yeshuah The Messiah, this book has really helped me achieve a far more closer relationship with The Father and Creator of us all, and lets me know that we all can be used of Our Father far more than we can imagine or think and be highly effective in sharing Our Fathers love in the many circles of life we travel and live in. I brought copies of this book for all of my adult children and told many friends about it."
4,Insightful,"While I can certainly see that little this book has a lot to teach Christians about their response to God, I don't see that it is anything that new. There have been other books that speak of the same things from different scriptural texts. However, it is still an important, yet easy way to remember how we should pray. By memorizing one verse, you can completely change your prayer life."
5,Life changing (if you put it to practice)!,"Tremendous book.Good solid teaching, with biblical footings."
1,"one of the worst ""christian"" books i've read","this is the health and wealth gospel repackaged by a author who supposedly knows how the ""Walk Thru the Bible."" This is a walk thru a ""soft, make you feel good, don't ask for any sacrifice"" Bible. By the way, that is not the message of the real Bible that starts with Genesis and ends with Revalation.I do remember a story in the Bible of a man who wanted to build a bigger barn, etc, but that story didn't end near as happily as the story that Bruce paints."
1,Repulsive!,"We Buddhists are aghast at The Christian idea of defiling everything spiritual with material desire. Only someone with no concept of spirituality would pray to a god requesting an expansion of territory. Self-centered people who desire increased income, bigger houses, etc., will try this prayer in an effort to get what they want. Sprituality? Good grief!"
1,Be a Berean,"I have some real problems with this book and I am concerned that the Christian community doesn't seem to notice.In the book the author appears to be saying that he has found the magic words which will get you what you want from God. Now on the one hand I believe that God always answers any prayer made by His children, although not always the way we want or in the time period we want. I don't believe that is what the author it trying to convince people of, it seems pretty straight forward that he is trying to say that he has found the prayer that God always answers and he wants to teach us to pray it."
3,"A good apetitizer, but not to be taken as a main course","For Christians or Catholics who dont appreciate the power of prayers and seldom pray at all, this can be a good book to start with. It's well written and is an easy read.Meanwhile, many reviewers complain against it as too positive thinking, pagan/materialistic. out of context....In fact, the author did stress on the importance of praying, with relatively extensive coverage in this tiny book, for letting God do great, ministerial and god glorifying things through, and not by, us, (Hope you understand the difference), and that we should have high senstivity to know, and to act on what God wants us to do in so given divine opportunities.However, I cant fully agree to the author's perspective because there seems to be some fundamental disagreement between his interpretation of Jabez's prayer and that of the Lord's prayer. For interested parties, please read ""Lord, Teach Us to Pray: A New Look at the Lord's Prayer"" by Arthur Paul Boers."
5,Selfish-minded consider this to be a book about selfishness,"After reading The Prayer of Jabez, I began to hear the critics and their thoughts of this book being about praying selfishlessly. I asked myself who could come away from the book with those feelings? The answer is clear: Only those accustomed to thinking with a selfish heart and mind. To me, and most others, I'd guess, The Prayer of Jabez is an uplifting book about a man who prayed to God for His blessings. What's wrong with that? As a parent, nothing pleases me more than for my child to ask me for help. And what child in his right mind would ask for a curse? I truly believe it pleases God when we ask Him for His bountiful blessings. Bruce Wilkinson had the courage to write from his heart, and write honestly, the same way God wants us to pray. I read the book in one sitting and would recommend it to everyone."
3,Not as expected,"I bought the dish for the holidays to serve multiple vegetables, but the compartments were too small. The dish is also alittle heavier than I like. I kept it & will probably use it for nuts or such. The design is nice."
5,abigail,"For those of you who enjoy a historical novel this is a great read. Set in NZ about the turn of the 19th century it tells the story of the daughter of a whaling Captain.It has gripping descriptions of whaling practises and life aboard a whale boat yet at the same time there is a very warm,human story of this young girls loves and life.I found Abigail hard to put down once i had started reading and can throughly recommend it."
1,Awful Timer,"Came without a battery, no instructions how install one, difficult to install one, not loud enoguh, unattached magnet to back of clock, almost has to hammer reset button before it resets clock, awful experience with seller!"
3,Packaging needs help,"This is rated for 12 and over, but my 6 year old is enjoying it too with a little help. My only complaint is the packaging. The cover art obscures or crops off a good two inches on either side making it difficult to do the edges. The full art is on the side of the box, but is too small to be helpful. We had to download the art off the internet, then run it through some manipulations in photoshop and print it ourselves on photo paper to be able to do the edge of the puzzle. Bad designer!"
2,pieces fall to pieces,"The pieces on this puzzle were not well constructed. Some of the pieces were flimsy and didn't fit together well; many of the pieces were not glued well to the picture, and the picture peeled off some of the ""puzzle bubbles"" (male parts)"
1,Horrible Quality!,"This is the poorest quality puzzle we have ever purchased! Several pieces were already peeling and some were completely blank because the picture had fallen off. We found pieces that were missing the interlocking part because that, too, had broken off. The puzzle was in such bad condition we did not even attempt to put it together. Very disappointing!"
5,Great watch,"I recently purchased a G3011. I have found that it is remarkably durable. I often bump my arm on dorways and on my preveous watches, those bumps would leave large scratches on the watch face. I have noticed this is not the case with this watch. Of the several bumps it has survived none have left a scratch or mark. Th countdown timer comes in handy when trying to tell how much time is left in a period at school. The telememo feature sounds cool but is impractical for inputing entrys. Also the duplex LCD display is a nice but ultimetly useless addon. It allows you to change the display colors. You can choose from a Black main display with red date and day, a red main display and red date and day, or a plain old everything is black configuration. Overall The G-Shock G3011 is a great watch and I would recomend it to anyone."
4,spring into action,"These shoes are very supportive and light, but possibly order them a half size bigger than needed, mine were a little tight."
4,Britney supersized!,This is a good package deal. The Cd's really speak for themselves. You either are a fan or not. I already own her greatest hits so I was reluctant to buy either of these Cd's seperately. This package deal is worth it because there are some songs that you get here that are not on the GH collection.
4,These were perfect!,"I must have read over 100 reviews of different pearl sets/strands on Amazon before deciding to purchase these pearls. They were just as described and pictured, and they were absolutely beautiful in person. I bought these as a gift but they were so lovely I think I'll have to purchase one for myself too! Very surprised at the quality for the money spent; excellent all around!"
4,"Great, but get the 1st edition","I am a true believer in this little book. However, the second edition skimped on the space for individual assessments of about patients, opting instead for a single set that can be thrown on the copier. The whole point of a pocket-sized alcohol-erasable book, to me, is sort of ruined by this decision of the editors."
4,Great Reference,"This is a good resource book for the clinical setting. It has lots of tidbits of information. The draw back is it is a little thick to carry in my uniform pocket and even though there are tabs to look under it takes a little bit to find info. However, still a great value for the money."
5,RNotes,"This little book is a great assist to any nurse. It provide you with with all the information at your fingertips to care for your patients with assurance. The pages clean easily. I can not imagine a day without it! And, I would like to add a thank you to Amazon for the prompt service. They are the BEST!"
5,Great Single,"OK, so first off, Fly is an awesome song. Second, the b-sides are good too. Skalds and Shadows is a great song, and sounds good acoustic, this song is practically not even a b-side (not good enough to be an a-side, but good enough not to be a b-side). In-A-Gadda-Da-Vidda is the worst track on this album, but then again, it's more of a homage to Iron Butterfly's historical song than an actual song for you to enjoy (maybe you'll like it anyway, in that case, more power to you). What I liked about this single is that the only song that's really a b-side is In-A-Gadda-Da-Vidda, and that's more of a collector's song than anything else, so theres no ""real"" b-sides at all on this album as that they're all good or worth having for collector's sake.I definitely recommend getting this if you like Blind Guardian."
3,Impressive in an average sort of way,"This was my first book on Lisp. What is great about this book is that if you are an experienced developer such as myself, but never exposed to Lisp, this book quickly exposes the power of lisp. Which was fantastic and is what this book does best. It did however leave me with more questions than answers which lead me to other books on the subject. Good effort but I wanted so much more."
2,Not good for a beginner,"Most of the 5 star comments are from people who are already familiar with Lisp.For a beginner, the book isn't organized very well. The code snippets use concepts that have not been introduced yet."
2,Needs a good editor,This book seems to have been written under a lot of time pressure. It is badly organized. You cannot enter code and run it as you read because the code requires ideas and code that are not presented until later in the book. For example defmethod if introduced before defclass.You see examples like(defmethod withdraw((account bank-account) amount)....)But defclass and the class bank-account is not defined until the next chapter!This happens again and again. Topics are introduced before the prerequiste topics are covered.Seibel also has a tendency to throw in details that are distracting and interrupt the flow of the material.For example in the chapter on classes he describes defclass and make-instance and then he throws in a long and technical paragraph on print-object.It is very frustrating trying to learn Lisp from this book.
5,"This book should be read everyone, youg or old!!!","This is the first book (and the best) of the Vesper Holly series. Everyone will love Vesper and her sense of adventure. If you havn't read this book drop every thing, and head for the nearest bookstore or library."
5,VERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERYVERY GOOD!!,"Lloyd Alexander rules!! This book is exciting and adventurous. LOVE IT!!Who is Nilo, really? Why did he just happen to show up at exactly the right time the Vesper and Professor Brinton need him? And that doctor; what's with him? HAHA! Lloyd Alexander makes an excellent story for anyone who likes to read!"
2,It is an ok book,"I did not like The Illyrian Adventure because I didn't like because the main character. Vesper is a know it all. She can speak five different languages and can figure clues out before anyone else. Her arm was cut and she didn't even worry about it. Someone was stalking them and Vesper knew how to get out of it. She just wasn't believable.The Illyrian Adventure is about a girl whose Dad died. He was an archaeologist. His daughter, Vesper, and her guardian went to Illyria. When they got there they met King Osman. He gave them permission to go through Illyria and finish what her father had started, to find the treasure. On the trip someone was following them. They found someone to help in their adventure. Find out if Vesper and her Guardian find the treasure by reading the Illyrian Adventure.I would recommend it to anyone who likes adventure and mystery. I would recommend it to anyone eleven to thirteen."
3,review,"I think Make Lemonade overall was a good book. It had some good points to it and let you see into these kids lives. The fact that they are so young, and had to go through these things was eye opening. I didnt really like the ending, It felt like alot was left out, and you wanted more. The author should have had a more complete ending, then it would have been better."
3,(...),"In the Novel Make Lemonade by Virginia Euwer Wolff there are many important events that take place. In the beginning of the story Lavaughn lives in an apartment building with her mom. She lives in a violent area where her father was mistakenly shot by a gang. She was walking through school and came across a flyer that said ""babysitter needed."" Lavaughn desperately needed a job because she had to save up money for college. Lavaughn did not know that this job would change her life forever. Lavaughn grows a bond with Jolly's children that can't be broken apart.Even though I don't usually enjoy books like Make Lemonade, I really enjoyed Make Lemonade. At times the book became boring, but I didn't put it down because I never knew what events would happen next! Make Lemonade was heart-warming and enjoyable. The Book was interesting because there are so many problems and solutions, that it always keeps you wondering!"
4,This book is about a girl who babysitts to go to college.,My favorite part of this book was when she first goes to the woman's house and sees what kind of poverty this family lives in. I feel very sorry for the kids in the story to have to grow up in that kind of environment and have a mom who is only 17 years old.This book is great and I would suggest this to most anyone and I know I will read it again.
4,make lemonade,This is such a great story it is about LaVaghn and she lives in this crummy neighborhood full of gangs and drugs and violence. It is the place where her father got shot and killed be mistake by some gang members. She desperately wants to get out of this wretched city and the only way out is college. She has great grades the only thing left she needs is money. To get money she takes a job babysitting a 17-year-old girl named Jolly's children Jeremy (3) and Jilly(infant). Jolly gets fired and needs money so she decides (with a little help from LaVaghn ) to go back to school. I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5 because at times it became boring
5,Make Lemonade,"Make Lemonade by Virginia Euwers Wolff is an excellent novel. In reading, the book you will find your self engulfed in the life and emotions of the characters in the novel. Virginia Wolff uses these characters to portray real life situation. Many readers will be able to relate to or come to understand some of the issues at hand. The writing style permits you to empathize with the characters of the novel. This work of fiction will allow you to develop opinions about the greater good in life. Sometimes what is important in life may not always be personal gain as depicted in Make Lemonade."
4,Make Lemonade,"Make Lemonade is a book about a teenage girl (Verna) who needs money for college so she baby-sits for a family. The family is a single mom with two kids. The great babysitting job is not as great as Verna expected.....This book has an interesting format, it is written like a poem. Make Lemonade teaches you about appreciating what you have. You do not realize how fortunate you are until you read this book. This book teaches you that all the people that are poor in life do not chose to be poor and are trying to earn money to dig themselves out of the poor house. This book also teaches the reader about dedication because, even though Verna didn't really like the job she kept going back to help the family, out of the goodness of her heart. This book really teaches you many important lessons. I rate this book a 4 out of 5 because it was interesting but there were so boring parts."
3,Make Lemonade,"Make Lemonade,When i saw this title it brought back lots of memories of summers from past when i would hang out with friends drinking this sweet summer drink.So needless to say i didn't think a book with this title would be that good,boy was i surprised.The characters show good emotion with each other,Miss Wolff did a very good job tying the characters together.The problem with the book is that its like the main character is telling you every thing like your talking to her,and that gets kinda annoying half way in to the book,a second problem is the lack of lenth.I could have read this in 2 mabe 3 days with out distractions,and there aren't many tricks and turns in the book.And whats with the chapters,a lot of them last like 1 page.Its pretty simple and straight forward.The core of the story was still nice enough to get me to give it a 3 out of 5."
1,so so,This book was a good lesson of coming of age but the plot wasn't very good and the book styling was strange.
5,My opinion on make lemonade,"I thought this book was really good!!!One thing that i likedabout the book is how LaVaughn helped her friend, Jolly even thoughshe did not get paid sometimes. There were even times when LaVaughndid not do her own school work because she knew how badly Jolly neededher help.I learned ... because you are still young and have alot tolearn about yourself and the world. The book also points out that ifyo have tough times you can make the best of it and survive and go onto a better life. In other words,one should think positive and makelemonade out of lemons."
1,Bally,"First of all, I did not like this book and was very dissappointed. I think the author was trying too hard to make us feel sympathy towards the characters in the book. In comparison to the other books I have read this year, this book was very boring. It was all about a high school girl who dreams of going to college, but needs some money to get there. She takes an after school job babysitting, but it begins to consume her entire life. It would have been fine if the story came to a conclusion, but instead the words just slowly died off. I thought I would have liked it because it took place in an environment that I know well, school. However, it was all about tragedy and sadness. Frankly, this book depressed me. I believe the theme was to never give up, but I never reached it in the sea of boring words. Oh well!"
3,Make Lemonde: My Opinion,"I enjoyed Make Lemonade beacuse of it's realism, emphisis on learning, and emphisis on responsibilty. Make Lemonade was a true book that displayed realism and showed life as it really was. For example, it explained how a seventeen-year-old girl struggled her way to bring up children. Another reason i enjoyed this book is beacuse of its emphisis on learning. Learning is very important in life beacuse it tells how i will live the rest of my life. For example, Lavaughn wanted to go to college to get out of the town she was in, and live a better life. The last reason i enjoyed Make Lemonade was because of its emphisis on responsibility. Lavaughn's mother greatly emphisized on her schoolwork. She did this so Lavaughn can easily get into college-and live better life. In the end, Make Lemonade had great emphisis on morals that should be important in everyone's life."
3,"Unless you are a younger teen, you probably will not enjoy.","I thought this book was just 'OK'. Due to the fact it was so short, it wasn't a bad hour or two. However, there just wasn't much to the book. Yes, I get the underlying story, but in terms of enjoyment...it was just lacking. Maybe if I was a younger teen I would have enjoyed this, but as an adult not so much."
4,Make Lemonaide,I thought that this book was a fantastic book. I liked how it was written like a poem. However I've heard that there's a third book comming out. If this is true I'd like to know when it will be out.
5,"""No lemon bloom""","Make Lemonade is a remarkable story of two young girls trying to fullfill and live life to its fullest. LaVaughn answers an ad hoping to find some cash to pay her way for college. She ends up entering the life of 17 year old Jolly. Jolly, a mother of two, has no work and goes back to school. She doesn't pay LaVaughn anything but still she stays. A friendship emerges from this book and a story of just how hard life is. It teaches you to embrace what you have and never ever to let go."
2,"Perhaps, maybe, suppose.","An entertaining, though frustrating look at the Victorian era. Wilson's habit of using 5 words where 1 will do and never writing an unequivical sentence grows old quickly, and it is hard to keep track of where each chapter is going. Paragraphs and chapters do not segue neatly into one another. While the book does discuss a lot of interesting ideas and people I can't help but think other books on the era must do so as well and in a more pleasing style of writing."
2,Lively writing by a settled Marxist,"This is interesting stuff and Wilson writes with flare. But, he's clearly out to condemn Victorian England from the perspective of a 21st Century Marxist. You find his text laced with tropes like'economic expansionism cannot exist without territorial expansionism.' (page 148) If you like that sort of thing, then this book is for you.Anyone know of a more balanced treatment of the same stuff?"
4,Excellent for any student of the early Middle Ages,"As a non-historian who enjoys reading medieval history, I found Professor Hudson's discussion of kingship and the royal clans interesting, readable, and detailed. His discussion of Mael Coluim II (Malcolm II) was particularly informative and well-written. He is remarkably free from the pro- or anti-MacBeth bias one finds in so many other works on this period. His discussion of Scottish interactions with Anglo-Saxon England explodes the myth that there was always enmity between them, and made me reexamine my assumptions on that topic."
5,Great Songs,"I am trying to collect as many female music videos as I can, and this dvd is a great one! The songs are all very enjoyable and how many times can you say that about a dvd? You will not be disappointed if you purchase this!"
4,Nice balls,"I really like these balls. I used to be a strictly Titleist guy, but these balls seem to get better distance, and they are just as soft on the greens, not to mention that they are more affordable."
4,"Easy Install, Solid Performance","There's not much to say, it was a very easy hardware install (slide it in, tighten the screws, hook up the power and sata cables). The I didn't use the provided DVD since I had a previous version of the Seagate software from a previous drive install. It was a quick setup. I ran a full set of diagnostics - no problem. It's been purring ever since. This was an addition to two other Seagate drives in the system that have 5 and 11 years of trouble free operation."
2,Fourth drive failure this year,"I purchased a replacement drive to keep my business up while I wait for a warranty replacement for the fourth drive that is about a year old that has failed in several different cases this year. Seagate used to be very reliable, but even their 5 year warranty does not help when you lose a TB of data. Of the four failures, one was catastrophic and data was lost, one failed just after I transferred data, one started clicking, so I removed data from it, and the fourth passes all tests but windows 7 says it is failing twice a day. The latter does check disk very fast until it gets to a certain place on the disk and then grinds to a crawl, which is what my computer was also doing. It is very expensive to have backups of backups.I would recommend a different model disk. These were five year warranty disks that were only about a year old."
3,Nice but noisy,I originally bought two of these bad boys to put into a NAS (network attached storage) that was going to be tucked away in a closet. Well the NAS (linksys) was a bust (returned it since it was so slow). I kept the drives and put them in my HP computer as a RAID-1 (mirrored) pair. They are fast but do click a bit as the heads do their reading ans writing. Overall a good buy and reliable so far.
3,Be careful with this Drive,"Be careful with this drive, Seagate has a known problem with many of it's recent Baracuda High Capacity Hard Drives, where after 3-6 months, the drive simply fails to boot.If you purchase this drive, you must go to the [..] site and use the drive detect software they offer there to see what version of firmware is on your drive. If there is an updated version of firmware then you need to flash update your drive.If you are uncomfortable doing this, then i would suggest buying another vendor's drive.The master seagate forum thread discussing these problems is here: [..] (well over a thousand messages).You can also do a search for ""ST3100034AS problems"" on google."
3,Good performance but loud,This drive works great and was very easy to install. I was a little disappointed with how loud it is when accessing data - it can compete with my iTunes music late at night. I have a feeling that most of the larger capacity drives will have these noise issues though. I still recommend it.
1,Dead after just 3 months,I had this Seagate 500 GB and it stopped working during normal operation.Now BIOS is not able to see it.IT'S NIGHTMAREBE EXTREMELY CAREFUL
1,Bad Drive - Failed to Format,"New, Out of the Box, it failed to format. SeaTools reported errors. Returned for credit, thank you, Amazon. I went back to a WD Black HDD.I was apprehensive to purchase a Seagate drive after the firmware and other issues during the past few years. This experience did nothing restore any confidence in the Seagate name.I recommend CAUTION to those who choose the Seagate name."
4,Excellent Choice for Home Desktop Expansion,"I have had nothing but good luck with these Seagate SATA drives. This is just the right size for incremental home desktop expansion. Hard drives do fail eventually; that goes with the territory. Having multiple drives around this size (and doing reliable backups), reduces the risk that you might loose everything at the most inopportune time. Those 1.5TByte drives might look like a bargain at first, but wait until you have to restore ""your life"" (assuming you did religious backups.) You can also use these internal drives to keep copies of critical files as an alternative to weekly backups; however, what we eventually resort to is using this added space as a primary storage anyway and fail to backup anything. So go with the distributed concept and always do backups."
3,Slow boot up,I have an i7 3770K and 16gigs of ram. I purchased this HDD to replace a 1tb SATA3 7200 drive that went bad(Hitachi). The boot time actually increased from 25seconds to a little over a minute. I even enabled quick boot in the bios and made sure start up programs were at a bare minimum. Still no improvement in start up time. That's a HUGE increase in boot time. Other than that the drive has been humming along without issues so far.
5,Good Hard Drive,"I installed this hard drive in my iMac a few months ago, and it has worked perfectly... no complaints! Although I didn't need them, it's nice that the hard drive came with a SATA and power cable for someone who might be building a DIY computer."
2,Annoying chirp,I use this hdd in my media center and am constantly annoyed by the little chirp it emits every time the hdd spins up after idle. I would return it if I could.
5,Fast,"Installed this harddrive my system booted right up with no problems runs alot faster,also upgraded my video card and memory.My system runs smooth and fast.I Windows 7 also upgraded to it runs like a new system"
1,Do not Buy Electronics from Amazon !!!,"This is my second electronics product from Amazon that was packed loose in the box.Unfortunately Amazon completely ignored the fact that this product is very sensitive to shock and packed it with just a touch of packing material. The product was loose in the box, bobbing all over.For now I have gingerly installed the drive, but if it fails it will be Amazon's sloppy handling.Mind you I pay Amazon for prime membership and related handling fees.I strongly urge people to stay away from ordering electronics product from Amazon. They are apparently trying to save some money by skipping the packing material. It will increase the likelihood that your electronics products will FAIL MORE EASILY and MORE OFTEN.Do not Buy Electronics from Amazon !!!"
2,No longer a 5 year warranty item,"I would rate this item 4 stars. However, one reason I purchased this hard drive was because of its 5 year warranty.When it arrived, the box said one year warranty. Checking with Seagate verified it was one year.I also purchased this item from the local Bestbuy for $75. Their computers said it was a 5 year warranty also. Upon checking with the Seagate warranty verification website, it would not take the PN that was on the hard drive. The box it came in had a different PN and that one was acceptable to Seagate. So, if you buy this hard drive, keep the PN on the box just in case your hard drive goes out within the year."
4,Good value for the money,"This drive isn't going to knock anybody's socks off with its speed -- it's only marginally faster than my 200 GB PATA drive -- but for $120, it's a whole lot of space. It also has a jumper setting to restrict it to 150 MB/s if you have a board with a Via chipset (as I do) that can not negotiate with a 300 MB/s drive. I have not yet attempted to use the included software, but it does claim to be able to clone your existing drive if you want to replace rather than supplement your existing drive.It's not particularly fast, but neither is it slow. It's fairly quiet, but not the quietest. It does run a bit warm, but not enough to worry me. It's a working class hard drive in all ways, just a very big one. If that's what you are looking for, you won't be disappointed by this drive."
3,Lots of Storage,Runs too hot to use in the Popcorn Hour Media Tank I bought it for but is good for bulk storage in my main PC.
4,Mixed...,"I bought this a few months back for my new build and frankly I'm not sure what to think. It works, sort of. It seems to have slow reading speeds to some extent. I BOUGHT THIS ITEM USED. I do not know if the product I recieved was previously damaged and almost fully restored, but with up to date mobo, cpu, and gpu I am very skeptical that anything outside of this hdd is causing me to have 1 - 2.5 min boot times... Downloading things is fine and everything works, just not as expected. I have another computer with a similar 500gb 7200 rpm ant boot times are from 30 - 45 seconds. I honestly do not know what to think. I am not a fan of 1 star reviews for DOA's / defects because it doesn't reflect the actual product so I will give this a 4 of 5. I would give 3.5 if possible."
3,hard to install on Windows Vista system,I have windows Vista and when I attempted to install as a backup hard drive it wanted to make it a mirror image drive. Then I got a message that the drive was DEGRADED and have to take my computer to an expert to have it installed right. Plan on doing that next week and hope everything works as I want it. I will update my review when I get it fixed.
1,Not what I bought!,"while I did get working hard drives in good condition, they were not the hard drives that I ordered. They were just packaged in a box with the model number etc of what I ordered but what was inside was a different model and lower profile drive. While this might be ok for some people we bought these specifically to go into a RAID set populated by identical drives, so getting shipped drives that were falsely packaged is very misleading and very inconvenient.NOT COOL"
5,Would've liked the full TB,"I purchased this Seagate 1TB harddrive from Amazon, it arrived within a few days. It was snuggled in a larger amazon box with a few air-pillows keeping it secure.I was a little disappointed the drive doesn't read as a full TB, but I guess thats okay.The drive was easy to install, open the computer case, discharge any static electricity from your fingers then install the new drive with a screw driver. Plug the sata cable into your harddrive and the other end to the correct sata port on your motherboard.Plug in the power cable to the harddrive then turn on your computer.Use the seagate disc to install the tools you need to set up the harddrive. Select if you want it as a boot drive or just a secondary drive, then set the partition sizes. Thats about it.I used the tools to clone my original boot drive then in bios set the drive to boot up and everything went smoothly with no problems...I highly recommend this drive, it has plenty of space for pictures and downloaded video."
1,Dead drive and Terrible customer service,Received the brand new drive. Installed it in the computer but it is dead. It won't format and is useless. Seagate warranty/customer service then charged me $10 to ship a new one. I will never buy Seagate again. Go with Western Digital.
4,Good but noisy,"I installed this drive three weeks ago and so far so good. The software provided by Seagate is good but didn't help me with transferring my system from my old drive to the new drive. The software does not support dynamic disks.The drive is a bit noisy, but not enough to bother this guy. The drive comes with a 5 year warranty, something the competition doesn't come close to. This is an excellent drive for storing your movies and mp3 files."
2,Loud HD,When running vista this thing grinds away so much you will need to turn up the TV just to hear it over the idol computer.I ended up buying a western digital again. Now my computer is so quiet I cannot hear it run. The guy at Fry's said western digital was going down in quality as an excuse why they don't stock it anymore. All I really care about is being able to keep my sanity by stopping the grinding.
1,Failed just under a year...,"Purchased this drive back in Feb. 2009, daily use, died Jan. 2010. Everything worked great and then xx. No sign of a problem, not a slow death, just turned on the PC (Dell XPS 410) and got the click-of-death. Like some others with one of these failed drives the computer wouldn't boot and couldn't find the drive (not present). A real POS. The really frustrating part is this drive replaced an 18 mo. old OEM 320GB Samsung that died. My old, heavily used, 1997 Dimension XPS with its massive ;) 13GB Toshiba drive is still working fine, go figure. I guess it all boils down to hit or miss if you get a good or not.At least it's still under warranty."
1,what is wrong with seagate SATA 1TB?!,"I liked and bought many seagate hard disks. generally, they are reliable and fast. However, this HD is a very weird one! The BIOS would stuck at the booting, because it was fighting to recognize the HD. this is the second HD in my PC. so, I install it as an external HD, turn it off to boot my system. After booting, I turn it back on, the HD shows up in winXP. BTW, my motherboard is ASUS P5LD2-VM. I bought this HD at local BestBuy for $79.90, which sounded like a good deal!"
2,Had two die in less than 1 year,"One died after 4 months, RMA'ed it for the same model. The second one died after 7 months.I would AVOID SEAGATE. The drive is NOT quiet at all.Compared to WD, Seagate is [...]. I took a chance with Seagate after owning mostly WD and Maxtor drives. This was a horrible decision."
2,Very Very LOUD,I can't believe how loud this drive is. It's very difficult to concentrate on editing with this thing screaming after every thing I do. Opening a browser or simply exploring the C drive is deafening. Now some applications are freezing. I'm returning this.
3,Mediocre...,"This is my first Suzanne Forster book and I have to say I wasn't terribly impressed. I thought it would be an exciting page turner, but I had to force myself to turn the pages. Though it started out well enough, it slowed down to a crawl in the middle, then picked up a bit and the end was a bit of a disappointment. There was too much concentration on the relationship between Jennifer and Russ, though Russ was a likeable hero. It was just a bit too slow paced for a thriller."
4,TODTI,"Ram Dass provides another excellent follow-on to his acclaimed ""Be Here Now."" The conversational style of the writing helps remove some of the tedium present in other similar texts addressing the nature of consciousness. Highly recommended."
5,Unqualified endorsement,"5 thumbs up. A classic, as far as my journey has gone. Especially useful for academics as it is written by an academic."
4,An insider's view of politics through a good novel,"H. L. Richardson was in the Califonia State Senate for 22 years, and developed a keen insight into how politics really works. He authored several books before this one, and has developed a smooth and entertaining writing style...a bit like Carl Hiaasen without the ""edge."" His sharp sense of humor even comes through in his titles, like his earlier book: ""What Makes You Think We Read The Bills?""""Split Ticket"" tells the story of a well-meaning businessman, who gets tricked into getting more involved in politics than he intends. The tale keeps your attention, and shows the undercurrents in a humerous way, without becoming cynical. Good clean fun, with a point. I really enjoyed reading this one."
4,3 out of 4 isn't bad.,"I could not find Little Giants on DVD and the same went for Surf Ninjas. Little Big League was a plus and I still haven't and probably never will watch the other one.Quality is fine, price is great. I'm just glad I didn't have to track down a VHS copy of Little Giants to give as a gift (it's why I originally bought the collection)."
3,Enjoyable,My daughter's favorite movie is 'Little Giants' and I have been trying to find the movie alone for over a year. This was a very cost-effective way to replace the movie.
5,A family Favorite that we long to own again!,I have owned this series in the past for three children. One still remembers the joy this series brought and would like to own a set. I would like to purchase this set again for myself. It was a great experience for all my children and to me.
4,A Nice Adaptation of a Superb Movie,"This is a very well done adaptation/collection inspired by what I consider to be the best movie I've seen this year. If you enjoyed the film, it's worth checking this out to see some additional dialogue that was left out of the film. The additional tales in the collection were well chosen. I highly recommend this."
4,Continuing the story ...,"If you watched the Kare Kano anime and were left hanging by the abrupt and inconclusive ending, here is where you need to begin to resume the story. The group is still in preparations for the play they are going give. Tonami's trying to patch his friendship with Arimi. Finally, the part I like, things between Tonami and Sakura get juicier and more complicated. If you liked the anime, you'll like the manga, so just do yourself a favor and buy it (and the next ones in the series too). Otherwise, you'll always be wondering what happens. (Note that I have not read the previous volumes of the manga.) Also, there is a short novella at the end of the manga that takes up nearly a third of the book. That story has nothing to do with Kare Kano, but is still an interesting shoujo story in itself."
2,Yawn,"This book was boring. I didn't really care about the blossoming romance between tonami and tsubaki. When I read volume 7, I thought that this was going to be the book with the cultural festival in it, but nooooooooooo. This book is just filled with boring conversations. Whatever happened to Yukino's looks? She was SOOOO pretty in the first book, but the artist seems to have made pictures of her seem so plain now. By the way, the short story in the back of the book, it was S(...) lame. It's just about this timid little girl and this giant stupid guy who loves the girl, stalks her, teases her, and is just (...)the next book!"
1,DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"After returning this item 3 TIMES due to defective product, my 4th shredder only lasted a month. This product just stops working. When it does work, it shreds papers very slowly and won't take more than 3 pages at a time, contrary to the product description that states it will take 5. This product is below standards and should be taken off the shelf."
2,Don't Expect It To Last Too Long!,"Ive had this shredder for about a year and it worked ok for about 2 months after which it barely could shred 1 sheet of paper. Now I have to put the paper through 2-3 times just to shred it.(Single pass just 'bites' the paper now). This shredder looks great but isnt reliable at all. Also, the pencil sharpener never worked well even when new!"
2,Liked it until it died,"I've had this unit for just over a month. Minimal useage. I was happy with it until it died. Must be a fuse or something inside as there is no power indicator. I know the plug works, the unit is dead however. Now I have to figure out how to get the thing repaired and decide if it's worth it."
2,Looks good...,"I really liked the design of this product. That's about it. It's really slow, just like the others have said. I received it as a Christmas present (2002). The motor burned out a few days ago (late February). It's not like I over-used it, it was used according to specifications and instructions. The product just isn't up-to-scratch. Save your money, or someone else's."
1,Was great for 4 months-then it completely died!,"Stylish, woorks well, etc. but all moot when it dies completely (the indicator lights do not even light up). Took a chance and lost! I would not buy another."
3,Dissappointed,"Item was delivered without instructions AND shredder was jammed already and it was never cleared until I got to it. I paid our good money for what I thought was a new item, but probably received someone else's returned item. TARGET.COM has nerve shipping an item in this condition, and it will be a while before I try Target.Com again. Computers run the ordering system, but PEOPLE are here to oversee all!"
1,Using scissors would be faster!,"Just not up to snuff. Very slow shredder and seldom does the paper feed all the way through unless you hit the clear button each time. As always,ALL FORM,NO FUNCTION."
1,Dissappointed,"Item was delivered without instructions AND shredder was jammed already but &quot;previous owner&quot;. I paid our good money for what I thought was a new item, but probably received someone else's returned item. TARGET.COM has nerve shipping an item in this condition, and will not see my money again.First and last order from Target.com!"
3,Dissappointed,"Item was delivered without instructions AND shredder was jammed already but ""previous owner"". I paid our good money for what I thought was a new item, but probably received someone else's returned item. TARGET.COM has nerve shipping an item in this condition, and will not see my money again.First and last order from Target.com!"
2,Works fine till it dies,Had less than a year of use. Can't find the receipt so I'm just going to chuck it.
1,bought two....both broke,"Love Michael Graves line at Target'. Bought the shredded, usual househoold light load.....it fried about 3 months after use. So what do I do???? Run back to Target' and buy the same exact model....because its cool. This time got an entire 2 months worth of light household use. You can be sure I will not make the same mistake a third time.Do yourself a favor....buy something else."
1,No attention to detail,"This shredder has a safety function which does not allow the power to be turned on unless it is completely inserted into the bin. If it is even slightly angled or out of place, it will not turn on. This is a feature that is helpful, but the user must be made aware of. The manufacturer of this product does not bother to tell us. As a result, many buyers (including me) concluded their unit was malfunctioning when it stopped powering on. A bit of jiggling will allow the unit to sit properly and thus allow it to power on. This a major oversight by the designer. Other than that, it works well."
4,Oscar Delivers,The man can sing...his voice is so expressive. very much worth a listen! If you'/re looking for a singer with soul and without the Motown sound give this a try.
2,Disappointing becausae it is so unstable,"I bought this Fright Yard Set and laid out tracks. I was very disappointed with it since the tracks were so loose and fell apart easily especially near a bridge even with the bridge supports that also move a lot. When my 2 year old son plays, I have to keep fixing the tracks and brige area otherwise he can't keep his trains running. I asked BRIO if I should glue tracks together or not, but did not receive any reply. I want to return this product due to dissatisfaction. Very disappointed with poor structure."
3,I am not satisfied,"I had bought the same brand few weeks back from my local deptt store, it tasted great. So I brought the same from Amazon, they are fine but, the nut and the white chocolate don't taste the same. More over the chocolates expire this nov 2010. I guess that's the reason.."
4,My pen pal tells me these are lovely icebreakers,"My Japanese pen pal Y. Yamamoto just adores Strawberry Pocky and tells me they're lovely icebreakers in stressful situations.Mind you, I'm not sure I should believe Yohko-chan as she describes these situations, many of which involve her flying a space battleship and using time travel in a remarkably casula way, but I must admit they're entertaining reading. and the souvenier she sent me from that space Hot Springs was rather interesting -- although why you would make crocodiles that are just like bananas is completely beyond me.Still, I want to date her friend Ruuan. She looks hot, in an amazingly ditzy sort of way....."
5,Great book for students,I'm glad I bouthg this book. It is a helpful tool for fiddle students and the follow along CD is a great addition.
4,Fiddle Tunes,Good book with cd. Contains many fiddle tunes and variations on each. All are on the cd so one can get a feel for how they should sound. Especially good for fiddle players who mostly play by ear.
2,Disappointed Mom,"My son loves the set - but after a few weeks of use the topstitching is coming out of the comforter. Also, the sheet set shrunk considerably after the first washing. Would not buy from this manufacturer/company again - will be too much of a hassel to return it...."
5,The Last Reviewer of Lost,"This song has absolutely NOTHING to do with Eminem's ""Stan"".The music is nowhere near similar, and the lyrics never even insinuate a link to that song. The last reviewer is misguided and apparently lost. The Wippenburg remixes are very powerful, with extremely addictive hooks. Hey Duddlypud, stick you what you know...Cheese and Beer."
2,Interesting bits of info,"The author's ""start-stop start-stop"" style of writng is a turnoff. Some sentences seem run-on while entire paragraphs consist of really short sentence-comments. It feels uneasy. The path itself is literally a one mile jaunt from the author's home in MA to a local college campus, making it primarily of interest to those in New England. However, the author includes bits of general information on nature that all can find interesting."
2,Philosophy and Evolution,"This book is a poor attempt at proving evolution. While I don't believe in evoltion but do believe in natural selection, I could still give a better argument for evolution than Mr. Raymo provides. Even though I had to endure the little evolutionary stabs he throws in to the mix here and there I did enjoy the history and the way he describes the beauty of nature."
4,"""Jenny Lind Street dead-ends at Seaver Street.""","This book was recommended to me by a friend. It came up in a conversation about good adjective use. And I take his point about the example; Raymo is a good author. His text is rich, but doesn't have that irritating sing-song quality so many naturalist writers cultivate. Based purely on prose strength, I look forward to reading more by him.The book itself was good-- a lesson in how marvelous things are all around us, even in the most familiar paths. If I have any quarrel, it is perhaps simply that the book is a little bit slight. It reads to me like a very good extended magazine article more than a book. This isn't specifically in the length, although that's part of it. It just feels a little bit thin in places.Glad to have had the introduction to Raymo's writing. Suggestions about which book to try next gratefully accepted."
4,deadwood series,this series is intense and very real. it represents the wiley ways of early politics in the western life of building a town. a little tooooo much swearing but if you can get around it a great series
5,only way to go,"if you want the series of any tv or cable show then the only way to go is get the whole series, every year it was on, instead of getting a year at a time, amazon had all three years at a great price. excellent condition and delivered on time, the only way to go."
5,husband <3 it..,got this for my husband for christmas he loves it watches every chance he gets once every months <3 it.....
1,Foul,"I received this set as a gift and anticipated enjoying a western series. Unfortunately, any meaningful story line is obscured by the overwhelming profanity, nudity and celebration of gross immorality. This product should be clearly marked as adult content due to its offensive nature. I made it through three episodes and then deposited this where it belonged: the trash."
1,Stick with the DVD,"One of the best series ever made, but the agravation of blue ray (which is no longer new and has never been a format) is not offset by the difference in video quality. Save some money and buy the DVD."
1,More Deadwood Agony,"If you love this show, reside in Australia and like me have been waiting to relive this brilliant piece of television in high definition don't bother. This box set is not coded for Australian Blu ray players. All attempts to get clarity from Amazon about when it will be released in Blu ray for Australia have been very disappointing. The responses I receive are either totally irrelevant ( ie the first reply I received related to DVD's) or I don't get a response at all. If anyone knows when this wonderful show will be released in Blu ray for Australia I'd love to know.D.McBethMelbourne, Australia"
1,Deadwood,this show has the WORST language I ever heard - it is impossible to follow the story because of the OVER USE of the F word - when it doesn't even fit in the sentence! horrible language made it impossible for me to finish watching the series...too bad it was so over done - could have been a good story about the old west - I would NOT recommend it to anyone!
2,Foul foul foul language,"I'm a former US Marine, so I'm somewhat oblivious to foul language. But come on. Every other word is F'this, F'that, Mother F'er. I barely finished up the first season before putting this entire series to rest. Besides the language, it's a quality production with strong characters. I especially liked Powers Boothe role as the towns new gambling competition. Final comment -- I would not recommend this, and if your curiosity compels you to view this, rent it first and prepare yourself for ear ringing profanity."
1,Very raunchy language!,This series was a huge disappointment. Every other word was a swear word. You could not understand the dialog because of so much swearing. I got this series because I thought it would be more accurate and follow the lives and real story of the town of deadwood. I was very disappointed and was sickened by all the nudity and swearing. If you have any family values do not buy this series!
2,Malfunction,One of the disks malfunctioned and will not play. The film is just okay but much too much profanity for no practical reasons.
1,deadwood: the complete series,"This arrived immdeiately and was in excellect condition. I ordered this because we like Timothy Olyphant, especially Justified, and had heard good things about this series. We could not get passed the first 15 minutes of the show. The language is so filthy that we could not stand to watch another minute of it. The show may be very good. It certainly has a strong cast of talented actors. However, the language is so fowl and every sentence is filled with so many unnecessary cuss words that we simply had to turn it off. We are not prudes, are not easily offended and use our share of bad lauguage. Nothing, however, to compare with the language in this series. I should have known since it was produced by HBO. Amazon, I will definately be trading this one back in to you. What a disappointment."
1,NOT the complete Deadwood,HBO cheated its customers with this series. When viewing figures were not high enough for them it ended the series with what must be one of the most unsatisfying final episodes ever seen. There was talk of a separate feature film that would wrap up the series properly but it looks as if that won't happen. Personally I have given up watching a lot of TV series because you simply never know when the producers will pull the plug and leave the viewer in mid plot.
1,TAPE IS DEFECTIVE,DISC # 2 & 6 ARE UNWATCHABLE DUE TO CONSTANT FREEZING. THERE ARE 19 EPISODES SO I WILL GIVE A COMPLETE REVIEW APON COMPLETION.
2,Language is Horrible!,"The story and acting keeps you coming back, you don't want to stop. However, this is a series I could and would not loan out for someone else to watch. The language is horrible!"
4,Gone too soon...,"Rich characters, shocking stories and surprising twists is what HBO's Deadwood is made up of. Characters that I didn't like at first I ended up loving at the end. I was left with my jaw hanging open in many episodes...I loved how you never knew what was going to happen. The language of Deadwood seems a bit tacky at first but once you get into the show it just goes with the time and place in history. And there really is not very much nudity AT ALL. This TV series is loosely based on the real story of the town of Deadwood. The last disc is filled with interesting tidbits on the real town and is not to be missed. I would have loved to see where this show would have gone if it had not ended so abruptly."
5,Great show,"I love this show. It may have been better if they had cut out about 2/3 rds of the cuss words,Ha. Im not sure people cussed that much back then, but come on!. If they had cut them there would still been a lot. As for Al Swerengen, oh my God, I cant believe he was my favorite character in the show. Bullock was a whiny nerd who had a bad temper. Calamity Jane was good for a lot of laughs. I hated George Hearst, to many characters to list who you either hate or like. You have to get the whole set and watch it, otherwise it would be hard to keep up with, Ive watched about 3 times and still enjoy it."
5,chief ron,if thats the way it was during the gold rush in deadwood am glad i was not there...this is an great view of the way it was...
5,MESMERIZING & COMPELLING,"I loved the Deadwood Series and was so disappointed and saddened to see it canceled after the Third Season. (HBO, YOU WERE IDIOTS TO CANCEL THIS SERIES!) The acting was superb, and the writers awesome. The set design, costumes, language ... all very authentic. You got caught up in the gripping plots (based on actual events) and the tension of suspense kept you glued to your seat in eager anticipation for the next episode. I ordered the Complete Set from a third party off of Amazon and the DVDs arrived in perfect, A+ condition! Could not be more pleased with the show or the product, unless, of course, to see a Season Four!"
5,Best Show. PERIOD,"One of the BEST shows EVER. PERIOD. The dialog, drama, POLITICS, acting, script are all top notch. You can't go wrong with this one. Just bare through the first 2 episodes of Season 1, after that it just keeps getting better and better."
4,Deadwood,"The show and the quality of the discs is excellent. The box was in pretty bad shape, (maybe from shipping?). Anyway, very satisfied."
5,Excellent Series!,"This series tells it how it really was back in that day! Great believable actors and actresses. Wish it was longer than three seasons! Have been to Deadwood, and it's great to see how it was back in the day!"
4,Good press,"Will take a while to find time to watch this, but have personal promises this will be great."
3,Deadwood,"We liked it a lot. Are they planning to add more to the story line? It seems to beg for more, and that would be a welcome extention."
1,So Disappointed!,"We read so many good reviews on this dvd, that we decided to splurge and buy the complete series. What a mistake! We watched 15 minutes of the first episode, and turned it off. We don't understand these people that rave about how wonderful the script is, etc, etc. If you took out all the profanity, you would have a silent movie. Just shows you the intelligence required to write a movie script these days. We are used to some profanity in movies, but this one went WAY over the edge. You would have to send me on a time machine back to the old west to prove to me that they talked that way all the time, plus heard some words that I doubt were even in the English language then. I learned an expensive lesson, read all the reviews! Although there seems to be a great number of people who enjoyed the series, it's too bad that their vocabulary is so limited."
5,Deadwood Series,"I purchased the set for myself then my niece wanted to see it so I bought her a set...THEN my other niece was envious so I bought her a set, too! The series itself is wonderful, but I have never seen such nice packaging. The extra discs are great! Beautiful set."
3,Great series,"The series if great, but I was a little disappointed in the condition of the box. It appears it had been wet? The movies play okay, but I worry about long term usage if they will hold up. I hope so, it's a great series"
4,GREAT SERIES,"I was disappointed with HBO not so much that they cancelled Deadwood, but the ending was not very good. They had said that they were going to have a movie to give closure to the series but they never did. I was so disgusted with HBO for that ending I cancelled HBO and have not subscribed again. That being said, the series is great and I purchased it on DVD but two of the discs failed in Season 2 and I didn't buy it again. When it came out on blu ray and with the great price Amazon had I couldn't resist and purchased it. I've had no issues with the discs and I still have the same feeling about the show, a great series but a poor ending, but still worth watching."
5,best )$(!*(&%)~!(! series ever on television!,"The only downside to this series is the lame ending of season 3. I don't think we're ever going to get the movie(s) promised to really wrap up the series. The acting and casting in this is the best I've ever seen. To change Ian McShane from charming and adorable ""Lovejoy"" into the scheming hardass Al Swearingen (could there BE a better name for this guy?) is a testament to his ability as an actor. The entire cast is simply phenomenal, and this show depicts the Old West a lot more realistically than Gunsmoke ever did... An excellent, excellent series, and one that is sorely missed."
4,"Almost ""Rave""!","Great! The style of dress of a backwater 19th century frontier town is convincingly ""period"". The quaint style of 19th century conversation is ""period"". However, I'm not sure the foul language portrayed here would have been as common in 1876 as it is in this series, even in a whore house. About the characterizations, I'm reminded of the line from a pop tune of a few years ago: ""There ain't no good guys. There ain't no bad guys. There's just you and me, and we just can't agree."" Refreshing."
5,Deadwood: The Complete Series,Unfortunately the series ended abruptly but I enjoyed the complete 3 season series. I started watching this with my fiance and found myself getting more entailed with the cast during every episode. Not intended for younger audiences since there is a lot of cursing throughout the entire series. Would recommend this to anyone that enjoys learning about the ways of the old west and the development of the United States.
1,Bad Discs!!!,"The show is great ; perhaps the best ever produced. Unfortunately, as so many others have said, some of the discs won't play. There is no visible defect, and no way to know if you will be so unlucky as to get a set with defective discs. Even the ones that load, they too will sometimes crap out in the middle of an episode, regardless of what DVD player I use. I have made many fruitless efforts to find a remedy, but it seems like I am stuck with these rather expensive ersatz, plastic mirrors. I am furious! This was not a cheap investment, and it pains me to have to give this show less than the five stars it deserves!"
5,One of my favorites,"The only bad thing about this series is that it didn't continue longer. One of my favorite shows of all time. I received this as a gift for fathers day from my wife, who knows I love this series. I now watch the entire series end to end beginning every fathers day.I highly recommend if you are a fan of HBO's series."
3,"Deadwood,complete seasons","I ordered the complete series of Deadwood for my Husband's Birthday and he has discovered that one of the discs are missing!!!!This does NOT make me happy...other than that we are pleased.It was ordered in September,his Birthday is October 17th and has just discovered the missing disc.What can be done to remedy this situation?!!!!My husband is still at Ft.benning as he has just returned from war so I do not have the collection here in CT..He will return here,CT,the first week in December as he begins the next 4 years in the Reserves.We shop through Amazon ALOT and would like to continue to do so but this last experience has left us displeased.Is there anything that can be done to remedy,replace the missing disc that I PAID for?!!!.."
1,Complete set of a series that was never completed,"Why would anyone spend this amount of money to be left hanging at the end because it was never completed? This is like a book with the last several pages missing. HBO never aired the fourth season, and never ended the story line. I can't believe they had the guts to market this incomplete series, and at such a premium price. I enjoyed the original shows, but wouldn't have wasted my time had I known it would never have a closing."
2,DEADWOOD,DEADWOOD the Complete Series was incomplete. The discs for the third season were blank except for the opening shot. We have been unable to contact a service representative at Amazon to rectify this problem.
2,Would be much better without the constant foul language,"Great characters, settings and cinematography very good and started watching and enjoying but the constant unnecessary filthy language unfortunately has slowly turned me off watching. I'm no prude but the constant use of of such filthy talk is a real turn off, particularly the denigration of the females in the series... Why do they think they need to put all that in? It would be so much better if toned down. Sure people swore back then in the old west but I don't believe most of that sort of language was about in those days. Very disappointing and sorry I spent my money."
5,Deadwood: The complete series.,"Rip snortin' western historic drama. I've not finished viewing the whole thing yet but I've sure lost some sleep staying up watching this awesome production. It is most difficult to shut the player off and go to bed. When I finally finish this series, I'm just gonna' start all over from the beginning and watch er' again."
5,great,"I've only done this workout about 7 times now, but I've already seen results. You don't sweat, but it gives you a great workout. Callan Pickney lets you off the hook well, too (""this may be difficult at first, try it this way until you are stronger"") It's quick, makes you feel good, but you have to be willing to exercise am and pm."
5,Nice for the shorter workout,"The biggest complaint about Callanetics is that it is a bit boring. With this tape you get through too quickly to be bored, and if you want, you can fast forward and do both workouts at once.Even if you don't have the original Callanetics you can follow this tape, but do get the other when you have a chance."
5,Outstanding. Fast. Saves your back.,"I've never seen such quick results. I do feel better too. I salute Callan Pinckney for bringing ""exercise"" within everyone's reach. No excuses for not doing the exercises--20 minutes in the morning and evening is possibly for anyone. Go for it!"
5,best live progrock album,"Well, I imagine most people purchasing this on CD probably had it on vinyl or tape many years ago. But if there's anyone who's never heard this live recording of ELP, I'll try to explain. ELP was one of the top progressive rock bands of the 70s, combining rock with jazz and classical, and wanting to remain entertaining the whole time. They released many very successful studio albums, but on this live album you can really hear how the energy of the crowd feeds the band and pushes them up yet another notch. It is noteworthy that the music is amazingly ""full"" sounding....this is a band of only three people, there is no backing tracks, no midi, no sequencing...in fact, there wasn't even a polyphonic synthesizer invented yet."
2,BORING!,"In the 70's, ELP was an entertaining live act. When they were with their 80 piece orchestra, double size drum kits and flaming/ wobbling pianos, those 30 minute instrumental solos seemed great.Without the visual, that same music is very boring and lacks the ""punch"". ELP is no ""jam band"" so the 3 minute radio version of ""Karn Evil 9"" blows away the endless 30 minute live version. The Greg Lake works (Lucky Man, Still... you turn me on) are much better in their recorded form.Only ""hoedown"" generates enough energy to make it interesting.I'm not saying this is bad but a 3 record live ELP work represents the good, but also the bad of the band."
3,Overly inclusive,"This two-CD package was originally released as three LPs. Listening to it, one hears the band both at their best and their worst. ELP was of course noted for their extended, classically-influenced compositions. Some of these come off well. Tarkus is done quite competently. The extended medley around Take a Pebble - which includes two complete songs and an elaborate piano improvisation - is also quite listenable. Unfortunately, the band also chose to include the garish Karn Evil 9, and several other inferior tracks. This album would have been better if it had been limited to a single CD, with less filler."
5,A Good Remastering of the Classic Album,"The sound quality on this release is excellent. I have a number of ELP releases in this series from Sanctuary and they're all really good soundwise. The extra liner notes on each release are also nice. Also the song Tarkus is presented as a single track and is not spliced. On the original vinyl release, this version of Tarkus was too long for a single side of vinyl and had to be cut and placed on two sides. This 20 minute plus extravaganza version of Tarkus is great to listen to without any interruptions! Overall, the album showcases ELP in their prime, and is definitely one of their better live albums. Especially recommended for ELP fans."
4,Remastering worth it,"There is nothing new here, but the quality of the sound is so improved as to make this absolutely worth the cost for any serious ELP fan. The packaging is very nice as well, but really, who cares? The toons are finally reproduced with a minimum of distortion."
4,Lightweight Stroller,"This stroller was everything I expected: lightweight, small enough to fit thru narrow spaces. I have a 3 year old and a one year old and it is comfortable for them. So far I have had no problems. The only two things I would mention is that the rear seat does not have alot of leg room for older children, my 3 yr old just fits. The other thing is that the button on right side to adjust the front seat leg area got stuck right after purchase. So subsequently it is stuck on one side. But overall I would rate this a great product."
3,Not Lowell's best,"I love Elizabeth Lowell and this book came highly recommended to me by a lady I met in the library.Pros: Hot love scenes, serious fears with a traumatic cause, good chemistry between characters, great location.Cons: Meddling aunt I could have done without, lots of lies and secrets, for at least the first half of the book Damon (male love interest) was a first class jerk.This book was reissued in 2011, but was written in 1987. I think over time Lowell has become a much better writer, and so I was expecting much more. This book needed some serious editing."
3,Reissue,This is a reissue of Silhouette Intimate Moments No. 256 from the 1980s. It's clearly dated in attitude.
4,A warm book for a cold winter day,"I've read this book twice, and though I lend most of my books to friends this is a keeper. Sent by a meddeling boss on a suprise vacation to Austrial our heroine finds herself facing her three biggest fears, Water, Planes, and Boats. Mandy is a woman most of us can relate too. She won't hide from her fears. Sutter is a man that has a hard time understanding her at first. But being a diplomate he has learned to study people, and by studing Mandy he learns that there is more to her than her sharp whit, and amber eyes. What he finds, he doesn't want to amit. Beside a few big goofs on the scuba diving sequences, this was a great fast read. Want to get away for a day, pick-up this book and go to Australia with Mandy and Sutter."
4,Another great novel for Lowell!,I really enjoyed reading this book. It packs a very fascinating story into a small amount of pages. The romance that blooms between the two main characters is RED HOT! You don't want to miss reading this one!
3,Ok....but,"I am a fan of Elizabeth Lowell and enjoyed the plot, the romance and most of the content of this book. However, when was the author last in Australia? Good grief, aussie men haven't called girls ""shielas"" for about thirty years and it's an extremely rare aussie girl who calls another girl ""mate"" - a term usually only used from one ""bloke"" to another. Also some of the diving terms were a bit out. (divers breathe air not oxygen) Ms Lowell's research is usually quite good so that was a bit disappointing."
2,Disappointed,"After checking this book out from the library I am very glad that I did not waste my money on this book. This may be a decent guide book for those who have not read any others are are looking for a very basic introduction to the wonderful writing of J.K. Rowling. I had to force myself to read through the book to come across information that I had not read in other guide books or online. Fortunately, there was one section that triggered something and that was the comparison of Harry Joseph Campbell's ""Hero With a Thousand Faces."" However, the section could have been much more analytical than it was. Hopefully there is more analysis in the more recent version."
3,Nice to have handy,"This was one of my Christmas gifts. I had looked at it at the store several times and enjoyed some of the topics but had not bought it since it looked more like an interesting reference book instead of something I would read through. In fact, I have found myself paging through it here and there instead of reading through it just as I thought I would. It is a nice gift and I am glad I have it even though I hadn't bought it for myself.I wonder how close the author's research takes us to good reasons why JKR named or developed characters as she did? I suppose we will never know."
4,Bought as a Gift,I bought this for my teen-aged daughter as a gift and have not given it to her yet. It looks to be an interesting book for Harry Potter fans.
1,Do not get this book!,"This book is not as good as it seems.You might not see it,but on the cover it says,Not approved by J.K.Rowling.This book is full of information,but none interesting.Do not,I repeat,DO NOT GET THIS BOOK!"
1,Rip off,"This book was extremly boring. The author is trying to make money off Rowling's popularity.Some people say it's a good reference to the books, but no one really knows that's what J.K. thought of.I suggest you don't get this book if you like Harry Potter. It's a waste to buy."
1,Don't Waste your money!,"This book was terrible. It reads like an 8th grade book report, it is that predictible and structured (and dull). The author quotes whole passages from the Harry Potter books, without any analysis, and then will lurch into a historical discussion of the subject matter. However, after that, there isn't much connection between the two parts. I've read the Harry Potter books about six or seven times, and this book does nothing to inspire one to read them. The most interesting tidbits are the ones on the sides of the pages, which erudite readers are bound to know anyways. I have several companion books which are much better than this one - so don't waste you money on it. (...)"
3,This is a MEDIUM book,The book The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter is a intelectual look to the backround of Harry Potter. I am 14 years old and i as a youth did not enjoy this book as much as I know someone who is an adult or parent would. If your child is reading the novels I would suggest it to you so you can better help him/her understand the backround of this magical place. This book helps brouden the ideas and the amount of knowledge this child will want to know. I hope this will help kids in the way that they way want to research what they learn from this book and spread thier knowledge beyond what they see on tv and read in books. It will explain alot and hopefully help you and your child. Thank you
2,What's the big deal?,"Personally, I don't see what everyone's so excited about. While there's nothing better than learning more about the facts and myths behind Harry Potter, it seems to me like David Colbert threw this book together in an awfully big hurry. Subjects like alchemy (ie, the making of the sorcerer's stone) and divination are discussed in much less detail than they could be, while much of the book is made up of filler--such as a three-page(!) quotation from ""The Sword in the Stone."" And why Colbert chose to frame the book a series of rather contrived questions is a mystery to me. Did I ask ""Which is the least likely magical creature?"" or ""Which creature doesn't know when to say goodbye?"" No, I didn't. Personally, I'm looking hoping for something better in the next of what's likely to be a series of books similar to this one."
3,Magical World of Harry Potter review,This was a gift purchased for a foster child for Christmas. I think it was very age appropriate and that the eventual recipient enjoyed this gift thoroughly.
2,Dump it!,"Way back when, I remember a time when there were only two HP guide books. I checked this out of the library hoping it would help me cope with my Harry Potter depraivity. I enjoyed it, for a time, but quickly it grew dull. I was too familiar with its boring illustrations and skimming explanations. It didn't help. For those of you who read the old one with the old cover, don't bother reaching for that cool book with the cool cover. It's the same dull thing. For those of you who have not read it I tell you only this: you're better off."
3,Fun book.,"Note:Eventhough I`ve, previously reviewed this book, I'm unable to find my reveiw. Good intro, to the worlds of magic and myth. however i don`t recommened spending, days in the library (I did)looking up and reading about myth and magic. Most of the books contradict each other, very confusing.I recommened ""Harty Potter's Schoolbooks"", [""The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter"" are based on ""Schoolbooks"".] ""A Sorcerer's Companion"".And ""The Magical worlds of The Lord of The Rings"". to satify curiosity."
3,Layout & Illustration - Kindle Fail,The Kindle version is a disappointment. Most illustrations mentioned in the text aren't provided. The captions for graphics break up the text. Very poor placement. The Kindle version of this popular print text seems a mere afterthought.
5,This Book's A Winner--Read It!,"You've got to read this book to fully appreciate the Harry Potter books. While I see a few malcontents may differ (there are some people you can't please no matter what you do!) every Potter fan I've talked to agrees that this is a must-have for your Potter collection. Well-written, thorough, fascinating information and not only satisfying, but an encouragement to read more. Definitely a keeper! My deep thanks to Colbert for writing it. Good job!"
2,Disappointing,"It's cute, but not much more. It'd be all right to borrow from the library, but it's not worth the money to buy it.Colbert doesn't seem to have put much research into it. It has a few interesting facts in it, but most you can find online. It's either a children's book, or an irritatingly condescending book for teenagers.Tone - Colbert writes his work as if it is fact. It is not, it is speculation. Some of it is very good speculation, but none the less...."
5,8 year old son loved it,I bought this for my 8 year old. He is learning more about mythology from Harry Potter and this book than he will ever learn in his public school.
5,Very Informative,"Any fan of the Harry Potter series will enjoy this book by David Colbert. Not only are there explanations for names and events from the Potter novels, but Colbert also discusses many mythological connections associated with the story itself, in a clear, question and answer based format.Highly recommended."
4,An Easy and Fun Read!,"This book stayed on the shelf at my bookstore until I finally gave in to temptation and purchased it. I'd have to say that all in all this book was great fun to read. The chapters were short, started with questions, and well written. I have always loved Mythology and found the author's insight refreshing and light. He wasn't trying to convince you he was right or wrong, he was just stating facts and giving insight to little nuances about J.K. Rowling's Wizarding World. What a great way to bridge the gap between book 5 and book 6 of the Harry Potter Series. I will be adding it to my reading list with my kids. We currently are reading a chapter a night of the HP Series and I'll add that at the end. They'll get a kick out of it."
3,This axe was made to grind!,"In keeping with my ""31 Reviews for 31 Days of Halloween"" review marathon, here's a really obscure slasher-film from the late '80s. I found this in its entirety on Youtube so you don't have to go searching everywhere for the VHS of it. Overall, this was a pretty decent slasher film. The plot was minimal and the way they chose to end it will make you shake your head and put your face into your palm. However, there were a few good gore scenes, the setting was excellent and was a pretty powerful thing, underlining the feeling of isolation. It was also nice to watch the development of the relationship between Gerald and Lillian, among the other detailed social mini-plots throughout the movie. Finally, despite a rather half-brained ending, the twist thrown in at the end was exciting and pretty brilliant! Good for watching once or twice maybe. Thanks for the time and peace."
3,Masked axe weilding killer...,"Hard to really recommend this, but if you are like me and love those 80's watered down slashers like Humongous, The Final Terror and such then pick this up.Not much blood, nudity and partying teens- staples of the genre- but we have an axe wielding killer, nice mystery and a cheesy end credits theme song (that all of those 80's slashers seem to have)."
4,A Diffrent Way,"I found that novel interesting in many ways though I, initially, thought it odd that Saint-Clair should stray from what has, so far, worked so well for us, readers of ... romance.A sigh of relief. The romance is there. It's all around the `Who Did Commit The Crime' hook.In fact, I just love the often delicate but totally sexy loveplay between Tamara and Marielle back in the vineyards. I read this in the train and it certainly provided me with an escape from the dreary landscape.Tonie Morris"

1,An Incomprehensible Mess.,"Unlike the previous 5 star reviewer, I (unfortunately) HAVE seen this movie and it is simply awful. I am a huge fan of ""Lock, Stock"" and ""Snatch"", and even thought Guy Ritchie's remake of ""Swept Away"" was watchable. So going into to this one I had high hopes. Well, the production design is lovely and the camera work features Ritchie's signature jazzy, vivid style. But the storyline? Seriously, if anyone can figure out what this movie is supposed to be about, the progression of the plot and characters, or the moral of the story they deserve a medal. I think is it something to do with gangsters and somehow ties in with the Kaballah religion that Ritchie follows, but beyond that I haven't got a clue. All I got from ""Revolver"" was a migraine headache."
1,"Revolver-You don't get it,no I do.","I am a fan of Ritchie's work I.e.,Snatch,lock,stock and Layercake,Snatch being my favorite and his best in my opinion.This movie starts off interesting and just goes down hill from there into some psychobabble finding yourself and your inner self thing,I mean Really?we get it you were with Madonna and the Kabbalah(some sect) or however it's called,you found your zen or your inner self but don't do a bad film around it.Especially if it had the actors and potential to go with it,and when the credits roll(spoiler)don't have Gutpay(whatever his name is From CNN a ClintonLiberal) and other Shrinks talking about the ego,I watch a movie to be entertained not because I think I am going to watch Freud or sesame street,people who are used to Ritchie's usual flicks are going to be disappointed."
1,Uhhhmmmm.........O.K.?,"After finishing this latest Guy Ritchie film, (who so impressed me with 'Lock, Stock & Two Smoking Barrels' and 'Snatch') I visualized Joe Pesci saying ""It's a mystery,...it's a mystery wrapped in a riddle, inside a turd! Even the film-makers don't understand, don't you get it?"" It completely escapes me what this film was tyring to get across! You take your typical Guy Ritchie gangster crime/con artist scenario and breed it with some murky Jungian pseudo-psychology and this feeble mangled hybrid results? Maybe I'm not as sophisticated as the target audience here, but this film left me feeling leather restraints and a 10 milligram Haldol shot was a suitable antidote. Avoid this film like expired milk."
2,Caught up in its own ego,"This movie tried to be too hip, too intellectual, too clever for its own good. As a result, it ended up being foolish and convoluted. Character development was sorely lacking, plot twists detracted from rather than enhanced the storyline, and all the flashbacks and voice-overs became just plain annoying instead of contributing to the experience. It had some potential, but fell far short of living up to it. I wouldn't say that I'd rather have a root canal than watch this, but I will say I wished I hadn't wasted my time on it. Definitely not recommended."
4,"Well worth it,","This is a great looking complex film that wanders a bit off the tracks but is still a fun ride. I'd like to have seen the longer cut of it to see if the loose ends that folks have pointed out got tied up, nevertheless I really enjoyed it."
3,Devolves from confusion to obvious to frustration,"Character development is fairly good but takes a long time. It is suspenseful but has a self aggrandizing feel to it in that there are scenes which are much too long, winding on and on with cute edits which add nothing but irritation. The substance is interesting but the action is sparse. It's a drama, not much of an action flick, although the gunfights are well done. It could be fifteen minutes shorter. The end is a letdown, and the minutes leading to the ending scene are tedious in the extreme, you having already figured out the reveal. Three stars because the bulk of the movie was O.K."
1,Empty Revolver,"It is surprising that Guy Ritchie put his name to this waste of cellulose. If this is is his latest to outdo Snatch, his best, then Lock, Stock..., also great, then he should throw in the towel. What a confusing mess led by a brain dead Ray Liotta, so predictable and droll it is nauseating, that big fat Italian who says it all that puts us to sleep, and the rest of the cast that are wondering what's going on. This Revolver is empty - Guy needs to either get some bullets or put it down. Terrible film."
2,Sucks,Dont waste your time. Definitely DO NOT get this in Blu-Ray (think Ray Liotta's skin being enhanced)
3,Wierd!,"This movie is trippy, it is has a lot of starz I like and is gangster in the premise, it just gets really pschological, which is Life. It is many sides being played by a select few and Jason Stathem has a few good moments (Monologue). I would recommend this movie if it is under $5.00 (not includind Shipping). Worth seeing, not keeping. Ray liotta tweaks out from fear and the Chinese Mafia are gangster."
1,guns,"am a big big fan of Jason Statham, and got this movie just because he is in it, but if you want to avoid a bad movie, save your money and time, then avoid it, still if you are a fan, you might enjoy some parts of it."
2,Not very good,"Liked his other movies, this one not so much. Didn't get it. Some interesting camera work not much else in this one. Watch his other movies, stay away from this one."
4,revolve,"its good, if you liked his other movies you'll like this one....and if ya don't know, ya better ask somebody."
5,UK Version not North America,"I had originally seen this film in its original format (UK Version) and when it FINALLY came to North America I was very very annoyed to see it changed. Small things like difference in subtitles to missing scenes to plot changes. I just bought it but I may drop kick it and set it on fire just because. It's still a great movie and in my opinion perhaps his best (original version), although I know people will shout and scream it's far from his best. A very interesting story, shot and cut just as interesting, but why the heck they recut it is just stupid. Perhaps because it did so poorly they felt the need to change it. Whatever it may be I can't believe it took this long to get here. I suggest getting the UK version but if you can't because of region issues I recommend it anyway. But what do I know?"
1,rubbish,"i cant believe how many good reviews this film got. i just watched it last night, and i think it may be the worst movie ever. jason stathem and ray liota both have 3 voices talking over one another thru most of the film which was giving me a head ache. the plot was all over the shop and the pieces never fell into place. the only reason i continued watching the film is i was certain everything was going to come together and it would make some sense, but it never did. im almost certain that the movie he filmed where some sad sod is giving madonna the in out on a beach for an hour and a half is better then this crap."
3,"Too many flashbacks, voice-overs and strange devices","The is awash in hard to follow flashbacks, inner character voices, animations, slow-motions, rapid cuts and time shifting. If you can get through all that, then the movie is some silliness about a revenge fantasy by the main character. Problem is the concept is way tooo hard to follow. The number of bad guys gets confusing, and the weird business about a fatal disease, loan sharks and the insufferable nonsense about high philosophies in defeating one's enemies gets on one's nerves long before it all comes to a merciful end. Also, the violence is bloodily graphic and sadistic. I guess Guy Ritchie was taking his Madonna frustrations out here."
2,Have fun figuring this one out,"**1/2Good luck making any kind of sense out of ""Revolver,"" a crime drama so complicated and convoluted that you'll need a program and a road map just to wend your way through it. It's about two ruthless loan sharks (Vincent Pastore, Andre Benjamin) who manage to turn several underworld mob bosses against one another, using ex-con con man Jason Stratham as their bemused pawn.There's a fair amount of dark humor to go along with all the bloodletting, but if you think the plotting is hard to piece together, it ain't nothing compared to all the voiceover philosophizing we're subjected to throughout the course of the movie.I bow to no one in my admiration for Guy Ritchie movies, but ""Revolver"" finds the writer/director at low ebb."
3,Not the same as the original release,"I enjoyed the European release and was surprised this never made it to the states. Needless to say when the film was finally release I was having trouble surpressing my excitement. However, the re-cut American version is a far cry from the film I'd seen. The movie was reoranized and scenes deleted and scenes added, while it was fun to see the changes the overall product was disappointing. I don't know who edited this but they destroyed Richie's original. I don't support ""piracy"" but if you find a way to get hold of the region 2 cut you won't regret it."
4,Better that I thought it would be.,"After reading all the scathing reviews this one received, I decided to wait to purchase when the price went down. I was presently surprised at how well directed, acted, and written this film turned out to be.If you're looking for a ""Snatch"" clone, don't bother, it's not here. What is here is a film that you'll be trying to figure out many days after viewing.Highly recommend this gem for people who like to be entertained and use their brain for a change."
2,The UK version is better ironed out.,"2 Stars for Statham one of my favorite actors. But cut 3 for the telling. I like these kind of visceral movies, but for some reason I did not understand what happened by the ending. And then I discover that there is a European Version, a directors cut if you will that better details the main characters thought processes. I kind felt there was info missing and a lot of cloudiness in the story, so when I went over to Imdb to see if I was just not paying attention well, but head over to IMDB and check out the discussion there."
3,Run of the mill,"Guy Richies name caries with it some connotations and expectations that are not honoured in ""Revolver"". It is not really funny, not really british, and not really that interestingly put together.All this, however, is not as much Guy Richies fault as it is our own. We expect him to do so and so, and when he doesn't we get disappointed.There are some great features in the film. It is well shot, well directed, and well acted. And the character of the assassin and just about everything he does is nigh on brilliant. The story is, however, in my opinion, a bit bland, a bit stock if you will. It is clever on a low level and not worthy of a big budget. And that is basically where it ends for me. The story is not interesting, the film is not interesting.So apart from a couple of great scenes and takes on things, it is just ordinary and pretty run of the mill. See it on a sunday afternoon with nothing better to do. If for example you've broken your leg and have run out of books."
2,Not the UK version.,"The only thing I needed to know was whether or not this bluray was the UK (original) version or the chopped up US version. I ordered it, watched it, it is the chopped up (US) version. Hopefully further reviews of other Revolver dvd/bluray releases will contain that kind of information. :/ I can't seem to find the UK version anywhere."
3,"Good movie, but could have been better.","I was surprised to read that there are other versions out there (I saw US version). Was I the only one that figured out what was going on very early on in the movie ? It was still a good movie, but they showed (for me at least) too many easy clues too fast and I already knew what they dropped on you at the end. That was supposed to be a BAM! OH DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING MOMENT. But it wasn't for me."
5,Awesome movie.,"I'm probably biased because I love Guy Ritchie movies, but this movie was one of my favorites. Every character played their part well. The storyline overall was great. A real twist at the end.If you don't buy it, at least rent it. It's worth the watch."
1,Hands down the WORST movie I have ever seen,"I am stunned that a movie can be so bad.... it was merely OK for the first 2 minutes.... when the star falls down the stairs, the movie was (ironically) all downhill from there.Rent or Buy? Dont bother doing either.... just avoid this one.My copy went from the DVD player to the trash bin."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought this book thinking that you could actually learn something from the labs. I was actually disappointed. First of all, it uses an old version of what it is now known as Webpack 5.2i from Xilinx, or foundations. the examples are very bleek and take the assumption you took the lecture before you can perfom this lab.It is obvious this book is geard towards a technical school rather than an engineering school. There is not much you can learn from this book other than learning a lesson on how to be careful next time when buying books.Disapointed buyer"
3,70's Cult,"I remember renting this movie from a local video vision when I was a kid. My cousin and I watched it, and I will be the first to admit....It isn't much of a Horror movie, but you still leave the movie with a strange feeling. You get mostly laughs through the whole movie, because looking back on 70's horror is just plain funny. I would watch it again"
4,Interesting look at the FBI,"The book is a recounting of the author's career in the FBI, from his start in the Hoover-era to the drug and gang investigations of the early 90's. I found it an interesting read. The author exposes some of the weaknesses of the FBI, particularly the bureaucratic idiosyncracies that plague the agency; at the same time, I came away with a sense of an organization that can get the job done in the field and put the 'bad guys' away despite the red tape. The book does not follow the typical autobiography format that most ex-cops use, and I for one was grateful of that. The author breaks down his career by crime types and major cases, and it maks for an easy, informative book."
5,My daughter's favorite sleep aid,"This doll is SOFT and smooth. The dress is a very soft material - softer than any other stuffed toy I've seen. Under the dress the ""belly"" is satin, so there is a nice smooth area my daughter likes to stroke. If your kid likes this be prepared to buy a LOT of them - as the others have said (my kid is a satin-stroker and wears that part out regularly). We've been through at least 10 of them (my daughter is now 10 and still sleeps with it). It can be thrown in the washing machine with no problem, but one time I decided to use bleach to disinfect the doll and it came out white (the washing instructions, of course, say ""do not bleach""). This is also my favorite 'baby gift' to give."
4,Really Nice,"This was my 1st DVD player. I really like it. Easy to use. I had to take the 1st one back due to vibrating really bad.I exchanged it for another of the same and it seems to be akay. I wish now I would have purchased a 2nd player same one for other tv in home while it was on sale at Target last week....This is good looking. Simple to use. And many features. I really am ""a happy movie go'er"" !!!"
5,Wonderful,"The story line, although fiction, contains many facts I was taught before even reading this book. Information about 40 acres & a mule, life after slavery, and the typical abuse slaves had to endure would really open the minds of anyone OPEN to contemplating researching, or even try to understand the TRUE history of early African-American people. Great job Ms. Hurmence."
3,An Entertaining Read,"Interesting and likeable characters (especially Nelson the dog), and consistent, even writing make this an easy and fast read. The plot itself was a little thin in places but the surprising resolution pulled it all together."
2,The reality is...nursing is not that bad!,"I have read Ms. Heron's books over the years and have enjoyed many. However, I tire of the constant portrayal of nursing as a powerless, whining group of co-dependant ninnies. This novel only supports these beliefs. I have been a nurse for 15 years and now practice as a nurse practitioner in San Francisco...and I love what I do. It's time to portray non-bitter nurses effecting change as needed, which I assure you is entirely possible. Also, I noted homophobia in Ms. Heron's book MERCY and was bothered. I chose to purchase another ""Mystery"" by this author and was again struck by the overt and covert homophobic remarks. I am quite surprised given Ms. Heron's listed place of residence. I must say that I need to do some thinking before I purchase another selection by this author."
5,Fond Memories,Saw movie years ago. Empire Jazz Orchestra played some of the music at a concert. Ordered soundtrack. Great music stands the test of time.
5,Great Depth,"Yet another new one for me this year, this one has a unique feature that is very challenging, each of the stations has a series of 5 `points for meditation' at the end of the chapter. These points can be used collectively for a long meditation or can be used one by one on successive readings. This one is also awesome to do as a group with friends, family or at church. Escriva who was the founder of Opus Dei really takes a reader deep into the mysteries of the passion of Jesus Christ."
2,disappointed,This book did not turn out to be what I expected in any way. I was very disappointed and am thinking of returning it.
1,"Was looking for photos, no photos","i NEEDED SOME REFRENCE FOR MY CHARCOAL DRAWINGS, NEEDED PHOTOS. WAS VERY UNSATISFIED WHEN ALL I GOT WAS A STORY"
3,Smart people don't act this dumb,"Terminal has a much better than average premise and a plot that moves along swiftly and definitely holds the interest. When you read a Robin Cook book you know it will deal with Big Medicine doing what's necessary to make a buck and always be at the expense of individual patients. This book is no exception. Knowing that, I generally enough reading these books. The downer for this one, however, is that the characters take actions which are totally unbelievable. Not science-fiction like (there are no walking through walls or mind-reading), but actions that rationale people would not take. Over and over again laws were broken with no thought of possible consequences. It just wasn't believable that people who had worked so hard toward futures would throw them away without a second thought. If you can look past that, this is a much better book. I couldn't."
1,"How about something new, Robin??","Congratulations, Robin Cook. You have the uncanny ability to take one plot and generate umpteen books out of it. Your books keep selling, so I guess you're doing something right. Okay, I enjoyed ""Mindbend,"" because it was my first Cook book. And ""Chromosome 6"" was enjoyable because the scenery had changed and the plot was a little different than the rest of your books. But come on! It seems that every other book you've written is the same: young doctor or medical student notices that people are dying in his hospital at an alarming rate. Hmm...sounds like a conspiracy...when he tries to do something about it, he's told to ignore it or he'll be killed. Blah blah blah, you know how it'll turn out. Come on, Robin! Mix it up a little! It's getting old!"
5,Funny and descriptive.,"I am forever wary of medical thrillers because of all the medical terms I cannot comprehend and the book offers no explanation, as if the normal grieving family has a background in medicine and knows what a subdermal hemmorage is.But Robin Cook surprises me in no way other medical thrillers have. His plot is simple, the characters are interesting, and the humor is amazing. I have a clear understanding of Sean Murphy and the situation he is in. I know he is a medical student and not a comedian. The fact that everyone else is serious and he has a sense of humor makes him stand out and you can clearly see he is the main character and not one that fades into the background."
1,I stopped reading it halfway through,"It starts out OK, but goes downhill once it gets going. The main character of this book is a PSYCHO, who appears to have a total lack of judgement. His girlfriend is an annoyingly unassertive character who simply follows him around saying, ""Sean, are you sure this is a good idea? I don't want to do this, this is going too far, blah blah blah"" before giving in and going along with it anyway. All of the characters are inconsistent, the plot isn't all that interesting, it's very unrealistic, and the writing is just plain bad. Not recommended."
1,SAVE YOUR TIME!,"No matter how bad or boring a book is, I feel it necessary to finish it. I can't believe I wasted a week of my life reading this! Save your time & money. I enjoy Robin Cook, but HATED this novel!"
1,Completely preposterous,This novel consists of stock characters walking their way through ludicrous situations. The corporate espionage angle is totally unbelievable. The writing is just as bad as the plot. The author needs to do some more research; there are three basic mistakes about places in the city of Boston in one chapter.
4,My first Robin Cook book and i was hooked ever since,Read this novel during my high school time. Well paced story and I enjoyed the sense of humor from the main characters.
3,Size Matters. . .,"This dish, while very pretty, is not as big as I thought it would be. I thought it would be the same size as a standard Pyrex oblong baking dish, and it's quite a bit smaller. I'm going to keep it, but it will not be as useful as I'd hoped."
5,"I want ""More"" of Matt. West","The first time I heard the song 'More' on the radio I was instantly hooked and wanted to get the CD. I then found out another really good (and funny) song 'End, The' was by him and went out and got the CD immediately. Unlike most CD's where there are a few songs that just don't hit the point all of Matt. West's songs do! His lyrics are incredibly positive and the beat will never let you down. I really like how they made the CD look. And the little 'bonus' you get when you buy it.(You'll have buy it, to see what I mean.) Matthew West really blasted into Christian music. And I certainly know this won't be ""The End"" of his sucess."
1,I was deceived. It's just an advertising folder.,"This book by Cynthia Kase is intended to provide you with ""the power of statistics to profit in the futures market"". To acomplish this, she proposes the ""kase permission stochastic"" in chapter 4, the ""kase peakoscillator"", ""peakout line"" and ""kaseCD"" in chapter 5, and the ""dev-stops"" in chapter 6. But the unbelievable is that she hides all the mathematics required to calculate those indicators. Very disappointing. I was deceived."
1,This book is an advertisement.,"This book is not a book, it is an advertisement for Cynthia Kase's ""proprietary indicators"". The content is a demonstration of how ""well"" Ms Kase can paper trade using these indicators, followed by sketchy details of how the indicators may be used. No information whatever on how to calculate or use these yourself. Having already paid for the book, you may wish to take up Ms Kase's offer to allow use of these proprietary indicators after paying $1000US. Or then again, perhaps not."
1,A useless read and total waste of my time and money.,"As mentioned in the other reviews, this book is nothing more than an advertisement for Cynthia Kase's business. While the indicators she's developed seem to have merit, there is no way to reproduce them with the information she provides. When I e-mailed her about it she ignored me. I wish I could get my money back."
1,The Formulas Are Not There,"After having read this book as a relatively inexperienced trader, I recently re-read it as a more experienced one. I found that I couldn't decipher the formulas for any one of the indicators presented during this most recent reading, so I called StatWare with the following questions: ""Is the formula for the Kase PeakOscillator in the book or not?"" The answer was ""No."" ""Are any formulas in the book?"" The answer was ""No.""Therefore, the book does, indeed, turn out to be a rather expensive advertisement for Cynthia's systems. Don't expect to find much more in it. If I am wrong, I would invite one of the reviewers who found these formulas in the book to share them with me through email."
3,Disappointed and yet...,"If you want a book that will try to convince you (indirectly) to buy/lease the proprietary software behind it, then this book is for you. If you want to learn about trading with Elliott Waves and fibonacci retracements and other subjective trading tools and rules (without any statistics backing them up - only trading experience) then this book can help. If you want to use the power of statistics (see title) to improve your trading profits then this book may fall a little short.On the other hand you may learn about new ways at looking at things (e.g. tick-volume charts) and the apparent relationships between price, time, volume, etc that you can explore and continue your trading education.This is not a great trading book but it's also not a complete loss either."
2,Missing Details,"The book might contain many good ideas. But there is no way to verify these ideas with back testing without the formulas of the Kase specific indicators. Kase lists the calculation of the traditional stochastic indicator, which is implemented in almost every charting package. But she doesn't say how the kase peak oscillator is calculated!!2 stars for the good ideas including the Elliott forcasting rules"
1,Another one of those quick buck books,"Fairly standard book in the trading literature following the following script:1) Create a bit of magic by pretending to teach a very specific method2) Throw in some basic, rudementary statistics and a few anecdotes3) Plenty of charts to show a few excellent paper trades4) Try to sell your own expensive trading course...I'm a trading book junkie and this belongs with the crowd of poorly implemented concepts and ideas."
3,Trading with the odds,"Book was quite expensive. $55 for 143 pages. I found some of the graph illustrations difficult to follow since the printing was so bad. Requires many readings to get the full jist of what the author is saying. Overall, I found the book and concepts interesting."
1,Just an ad for expensive indicators (that may not even work),"I was really disappointed in this book. As I was reading it I kept asking myself when is she going to explain how to calculate the indicators. And there you have it. She doesn't. You have to buy them. It's pretty clever really. Write up some proprietary software/indicators, and then write a book showing how well they work with cherry-picked examples. The book provides the advertising for the real product.Overall there are some interesting ideas in this book but unless you purchase the indicators you're not going to be able to use them."
4,Great,"Before stumbling upon this book I thought I was the only person in the world who had such fond memories of Cleveland's best department store. If you grew up in the greater Cleveland area in the '50s or '60s you will love this book.It would be great to see a larger-scale, more detailed book about the business of Higbee's. I suppose that because Higbee's was a well-run and above-board business that such a book might lack the intrigue and controversy needed for a compelling story. Still, the book left me wanting much more!"
3,Funny - but no McMullen,"Brothers McMullen and She's The One are 2 of my favourite comedies so I will always check Burns's films. This is probably his fourth best after Sidewalks of New York, which means it's a good film. Because the other 3 are brilliant. Great cast of funny characters with the typical Burns' scribed relationship problems. See it."
1,Very Disappointed,"This movie was one of the worse movies I have ever seen. Way too dragged out. The fact that it was closed caption (word for word on bottom of TV screen) made this movie even more worse then it was. The writting on the bottom of the TV screen was so distracting, I couldn't wait for it to be over. Missed the last 10 minutes had to shut it off. The story was so boring and just not interesting.My husband absolutely hated the movie and left the room after 15 minutes into it. I love Edward Burns, but this movie was a bomb."
3,"Don't look for truth in packaging here,","It looks like a fun movie, but it's not really funny. It's kind of sad and annoyingly tiring as you watch grown men hmmm and hawww as they decide whether to do the various right things or not.Of course they all do, mostly, in the end, albeit still with a sort of adolescent crescendo of silliness and overstated comaradarie that also gets kind of old.What this is, actually, is something of a male drama about five ""30 something"" friends going through various stages of life, trying to be supportive and helpful to each other as they prepare for one of their ""own's"" weddings. It's okay, it's fairly well edited, it's sometimes interesting, and it's full of talented actors and actresses, but it's still not outstanding entertainment.This could be a decent rental on a rainy day but never quite crosses the threshold into solid entertainment. Some good moments and commentary on married and single life, parents and friends. Not highly recommended, but not too bad, either."
3,Ambivalent,"I have such mixed feelings about this book. I wanted to love it because it is a classic I've been wanting to read a long time. And I did love the love story between Lorna and John Ridd. But the sheer volume of words that were unrelated to anything other than description and irrelevant details made this a difficult read. I know some people will savor each historical detail and the lose themselves in the language, but for me it made what could have been a compelling tale difficult to finish. Just as a point of reference, War and Peace and Jane Eyre are among my favorite books of all time. So my disappointment is not the result of the length of the book. It's more about the density of the writing that, in my opinion, weighs down a wonderful story. I wouldn't want to dissuade anyone from reading this book which has a great deal to recommend it. I would caution readers to be prepared for a slow read, or a luxuriously slow read depending on your point of view."
4,An epic adventure,"The story is great, the characters memorable and the setting is truly great. I only gave it 4 stars because I think the are some better adventure books like ""Treasure Island"" or ""King Solomon's mines"""
2,"Great story, bad narrarator","This book has a fantastic plotline, I Love historical novels. The only boring character was the one who narrates it. I wish the author had chosen any other character, as he comes off as a dolt and there are so many interesting plotlines, and other characters. As something considered an early 19th century publication, it is easy to read but I was frustrated by the narrators limited and naive world view. I skipped over many parts having to do with the minutae of the narrators life. Worth reading for insights into late 18th century life in rural England. Would buy paperback, and used."
2,Too much talk,"I read this book for English class and I have to say that this book is just not something a teenager would like reading. It's too long and not so interesting. John, talks to much about anything...I can go on about this! I found myself skipping through chapters. There is just too much talk."
5,A wonderful old-fashioned read,"I'd read Lorna Doone years ago, and fortunately, was re-reading it when I had to spend an emergency stint in the hospital. The book kept me enthralled, in another world entirely, day & night. Oddly enough, the very problem I'd had, erysipalis (don't mind the spelling) was mentioned in the book (the woman died of it; I didn't!) We don't need Reality! We need Passion, Moors, Wicked folks, Good folks, and Love!!!!"
2,Not Good Enough,"There is really no point in releasing anything of this magnitude without going all the way. All of these mixes have been butchered. Loleatta has to be heard in full length or nothing at all. The Greatest Performance is one of Ms. Holloway's greatest but sadly it has been edited. Not only that but it is very hard to find on CD if it was every released full length on CD. Plus what happened to ""Were Getting Stronger"".Disco is about the music. There are very rare exceptions to this rule and one of them is Loleatta. You need the fantastic music and her vocals in order to feel her magic in the right way. This CD is real sad indeed. Hold on to your money and try and get the full length versions through other means. You can find some on Walter Gibbons fantatic compilation."
1,Poor design,"The chairs are not steady and the picture on the top of the table is attached by bolts, not visible in the on-line picture. Crumbs, dust and small objects can easily get under the picture and are hard to clean out. This is a poorly designed product. I do not recommend it at all"
1,Not good enough,"The table and chair set is no different than any other plastic chair set sold by Little Tikes, the only difference is the stickers you stick on the back of the chairs and Thomas design on the table top. The chairs are too light and I would need to find a way to weigh it down so my 2 1/2 year old won't topple over. The Thomas table top is not attached firmly and as the other reviewer mentioned, small food particles and such easily get trapped under making it difficult to clean. I basically paid for the Thomas table top and the 4 stickers on the chairs. Nothing extraordinary about this set at all."
2,France? Think China,"Despite the name, this mill is made in China. The quality is typical of stuff made in China, not horrible for a mill selling for less than $16, but nothing to be glad you bought it. Quality is when you get something and think it is better than what you paid; this is not that. Sooner or later, vendors will realize that putting ""France"", ""England"", or ""Germany"" on a product, and having it arrive with a peel off label, ""Made in China"", is not quality. Some people still look for products made by free people, which is why the manufacturer puts ""France"" on the label."
3,Rather disappointing,"Staging: makes quite strange impression - it's hard to understand what mean all those chairs and livery servants unless you read the synopsis. The most absurd and annoying personage is a guy, who has been just turning over pages of some book (may be of the opera score?) all through the spectacle.Orchestra conducted by Marc Minkowski : solid but without magnificence. Though musicians on stage are very good.Singers: are of different quality. Alois Muhlbacher (little boy) as Oberto is splendid. Anja Harteros as Alcina, Veronica Cangemi as Morgana and Kristina Hammarstrom as Bradamante are excellent. Others are quite good, except Vesselina Kasarova as Ruggiero who doesn't sing at all but declaims instead, trying to fill up the lack of vocal ability by excessive grimacing. Ensembles are negligent - it seems there were too few rehearsals...Summary: this recording is obviously not among the top ones but is worth watching it. At least once..."
5,Superb performance,"Baroque opera has never been my forte and I readily admit that I may not understand everything this is need to sing/production this style. However, I found the performance on this DVD simply amazing and highly recommend it."
3,A1 People - The Visit,"A1 People go full-on funk with THE VISIT, which gets into its anti-capitalist stride with ""The Visit."" True, the lyrics might be a bit duff, but it still has a nice groove to it. You'd think that ""God Loves Brixton"" would be more religious than it actually is, but no one can argue with the existence of bass (the ""Acappella"" strips out almost everything except the chorus). The Buck Rogers samples that kick off ""Some Kinda ***t"" don't hint at the scatalogical funk that follows on its heels, while ""Turn It Up"" sounds terribly familiar. ""Nil And Zero"" gets political, an exhortation for education, but it's the gentle waves that start out ""Pete Tong"" that are particularly catchy (the track turns darker, of course). Good, but the middling rap brings it down a notch."
2,Weak and disappointing,"I expected a lot more out of Randy Alcorn after having read his book on Heaven. This book has very little deep thought or analysis. It is mainly a rehash of a number of scripture verses and multiple references to Jim Elliot's quote ""Giving what you can't keep to gain what you can't lose"". Mainly targeted toward the ""rich"" American. By the conclusion drawn from this book, the child who dies in infancy will live in a studio apartment with little furniture in heaven while the Christian who gives away all his/her money will live in a mansion. I agree with the concept of rewards in heaven, maybe not just the possession or power rewards that seem so prevalent in Alcorn's book."
4,"Ride this train up and down and across a strange, wonderful land.","This is not, as might be supposed, a collection on train songs. It is, as the subtitle of the album says, ""a stirring travelogue of America in song and story"". Each track starts with a monologue by Johnny Cash (backed by train sounds), where he portrays a different character each time. Then he will sing a song as that character. Some of the characters he plays are a coal miner, a lumberjack, a prisoner, a slave owner and outlaw John Wesley Hardin. This is a very enjoyable album. The CD adds four bonus tracks, which are of average quality."
4,John R. Cash,"This album has some great Johnny Cash songs that fit the man, the image and the style. I'd recommend it to any Johnny Cash Fan. I've actually played it for years as a radio announcer back in the 60s and 70s."
1,Bad purchase,"I'm a HUGE Johnny Cash fan, but this album sucked and had to throw it away. I've never been a fan of Johnny's spoken word, but rather he put his ballads to music."
4,wonderful adjustability,"This was a third basket added to my closet organizer configuration. Love that you can remove basket with contents, lift the framework off and move it up or down, and try out what feels comfortable to you. I stack my clothes higher than the depth of the basket so there is 6-8"" between the top of one basket and the bottom of the next higher basket. You can rotate the baskets seasonally, move the ""summer"" basket up higher in winter, etc. I find it helpful in locating clothing items since you can see into the basket versus a closed drawer where only the items on top can be viewed easily. Closet Maid products make a lousy substitute (IMO)."
3,Great when they don't arrive broken,These baskets are fantastic. The only problem was their condition on arrival. I had to return 3 of them as they were broken.
5,Rubbermaid Configurations White Sliding Basket,"This basket is a great addition to my linen closet shelving. I use it as my bottom shelf and it is so easy to pull it out to get to the items I would otherwise have trouble seeing and/or getting to. I highly recommend the whole Rubbermaid Confiurations system and use it in all my closets. I've found that it is very easy to install and has very high quality accessories, such as this basket."
4,complaint,the width of the drawer is wider than support beams. No toggle bolts or expanders were supplied.
3,Where are the other episodes?,"This collection was ""ok"" as far the ""Superfriends"" went... But I remember some more episodes that never made it to DVD. What happened to the World's Greatest Supersfriends adventure when they were in Middle Earth and turned into trolls? What about the adventure where Frankenstein created a monster combining the powers of the Superfriends? There was also an episode where a volcano knocks Superman into a parallel universe of evil Superfriends (complete with an evil Gleek!!) If you claim to have a COMPLETE collection (and even some ""lost"" episodes) make sure it is complete. I have purchased all of these collections and found none of these...What's the deal?!"
2,Seemed much better in my memory...,"Wow. What a disappointment! If you're anything like me (45 year old guy), you probably remember these cartoons as being pretty cool. Yeah.....not so much. This is defintely a case of ""not standing up to the test of time"". Having seen many variations of super hero cartoons over the years, I now think these are horrible. Actually, kinda laughable. Even my 9 year old son thought they were bad - he only watched one episode and won't watch anymore.If you remember these shows as being ""great"", then savor the memory and save your money."
4,"Up, up, and awaaaaaaaaaaaaay!","WB finishes this series of the Super Friends, it's more of what you saw in Volume One...core team adventures, Wonder Twins adventures, and team-ups between the cores and with special guest heroes (such as Green Lantern, Flash, and the Multi-Cultural Pals). Plus there are PSAs, magic tricks, and crafts. The next set of episodes include the debut (sort of) of the Black Manta and an appearance (REALLLLLLY sort of) by Zorak.Keep them coming, Warners! We still need World's Greatest, the ""Lost"" shorts, and the original series (wonder if they are purposely holding back on Wendy and Marvin cause they were fan un-favorites. This IS the same company that released the first Scooby DVD with Scrappy-Doo only last year, and proceeded to avoid his name in the trailer). And the 1968 Filmation Batmans couldn't hurt either./Thumbs up for Plastic Man being released in the near future, apparently.//And if they are adding Ruby-Spears series, how about their Superman too?"
5,all knew superfriends vol. 2,if you like superhero's all the greatest of dc's are here to watch. i would definitely buy it. don't forget the other dvd of the superfriends as well.
4,Good short videos,Good G rated short videos for by grandson's short attention span.Gives me a few moments to rest and watch with him.
4,charming but plotless,"Memories of a year of childhood, told in the first person but presented as a novel. The incidents forming the bulk of the book are framed by a narrative in which the adult author goes back to the village where she was raised. These incidents are often dramatic or amusing but they are separate stories and do not cohere to form a conventional plot. The book would have been better as a straight non-fiction memoir. The writing is often graceful but sometimes tends to the seed catalog school of fancy prose e.g. "" a sky as pale blue as the scabious that grows with fragile poppies and the scarlet pimpernel sprawling over the marled furrows."" I enjoyed it, but I had recently read Trezza Azzopardi's ""The Hiding Place"" and after the impact of that masterpiece of remembered childhood this suffered by comparison."
2,Not a fan- at all.,"Things you should know about this book:-Its extremely difficult to find at any book store, so you pretty much have to order it through amazon or something similar-It focuses on a character (April) and her childhood in the 1950's.-She is abused physically through molestation by Mr. Greenidge (an older man, over 40 years old but its unclear what his age is exactly)-April is 8 years old.-This book focuses on abuse- verbal and physical."
1,Beware,The item that you are purchasing is not being represented in the picture. Don't make the same mistake I did by ordering what is being shown in the picture.
1,Not my first choice,"Hard to follow . . . would recommend two other books instead: Thai Massage by Richard Gold and the Thai Massage Manual by Maria Mercati are both excellent choices,"
2,No Good,This book is not good for someone who has never learned set theory before and is self-teaching. The book has not very clear. Also the book does not have the answeres to the questions so one can not see if they actually understand the material.
4,Reliable description,"I bought the book used, but it is still in good condition. Fast shipping is a plus."
3,interesting history,"I read this for my book club. It was pretty good, though let's be honest... i have a very low interest in native american culture. It was pretty cool to learn about the transition from back then to modern times, and how the native american indian culture transformed to adapt. Especially here in the northern california area. Worthwhile read with amazing information."
4,Very profitable book,"Mechanics is not easy to understand, but this book helps a lot. Many examples and a brief theory is enough for helping students and professionals.Carlos - Vitoria-Brazil"
3,Engineering Mechanics (Dynamics),"This book helped to some degree, but I would have preferred if instead of seperate chapters for each concept they integrated them as the problems progress in the section."
2,Didn't last long,"I ordered this in mid-november and began using it shortly after it was received and the bulb is already burned out. I'm not sure of the expected life of the bulb, but I would expect it should last longer than a little over a month. I'll be calling Fluker to see if they will replace it or if this is expected."
3,Daphne's club covers,"I have purchased several of Daphne's covers and love them but this one is much smaller than the usual driver covers. It would only cover an iron though the tag said driver cover. It is of great quality however and has an adorable expression. Any Leo would love it, too!"
3,Just ok,This was ok nothing great but also not as enjoyable as the others in both series. A little too busy and not so believable
4,See below,"Reckless Abandon and Short Forever I was very happy with the order,however, the order of Run Before the Wind came in paperback. The Princeof Beverly Hills, L.A. Dead, and The Run by Stuart Woods that I orderedthe same day I have never received.Thank you for asking about my feedback. Sandra LaBunski"
2,"Like Stuart Woods, but this book stinks",The dialogue between characters in this book is laughable. It seems little effort was put in to the writing of this novel. Very weak plot.
2,Not One of Wood's Best,"You'd think that if Holly Barker teams up with Stone Barrington, you'd have a rip roaring murder mystery. Not this time! Stuart Woods has missed the mark on this book. The reader finds out the two main characters like to jump into the sack; but the author has not developed his characters very well. It's like he wrote this book ""on the spur of the moment"", while sitting in a New York apartment, with nothing else to do. The story line involving the FBI, NYPD and others looking for the murderous bad guy, Trini Rogriquez, is not very realistic. No high tech equipment (except powerful firearms) is referred to in this book. As the book concludes, it doesn't take much effort to guess how it may end. On the positive side,however, this book, like most of Wood's others, is easy to read."
2,The Careless Mystery Writer,I am trying to decide whether to finish this book or not. It is a big disappointment. Mr. Woods has put together two of his great characters in this new book. It does not work. It is as if he needed a new book to publish and threw this story together. Alone these characters are great but together it just doesn't work. I think that I will not finish this book - life is not long enough.
3,cd,I returned it. It was ordered by mistake. I did not have any trouble returning the C D. I read Stuart Wood books.
4,STONE BARRINGTON ** BOOK TEN,"THREE AND A HALF STARSThis series, Stone Barington by Stuart Woods, is so much fun, I find it hard to believe so few reviews. I highly recommnded this series to readers that like what is fondly called ""beach"" readers, that is casual, easy simple fun. Stone Barrington is a great character, always a hoot. His surrounding cast is just as much fun and pop up over and over. In this story of course Dino Bacchetti is there, Lance Cabot, CIA is a long for the ride, even the pest Herbie shows up important to the story. (READ THE SERIES IN ORDER). Woods throws in Holly Barker and Ed Eagle from his other series into this story to liven things up. This is not my favorite Barrington, in fact, so, so but easy reading."
1,"It's Over, Stu.Reviewer: Loves Thrillers, NY.C.","My short romance with Stuart Woods' novels is done.! A friend gave me one of the Orchid series books and I fell in love with the Holly character- and Daisy. However, RECKLESS ABANDON was so abysmally bad that I don't think I'll ever read another one of Woods' books. Stone was a pompous macho pig and Holly was a whining strident airhead. Neither had any resemblance to real human beings. The plot was laughably implausible, and the endless name-dropping of brand names made me crazy. Do you care if Holly wore an Armani dress? Or if ALL the male characters wore Bruno Magli shoes? That went out with O.J. And Woods must have an interest in Elaine's.... There wasn't enough story here to counterract all of this slush, and ultimately I didn't care anyway. Add to that the mindbendingly arrogant Author's Note at the end of the book and I'm done. Woods has gone the way of Patricia Cornwell - another former favorite that I won't waste my valuable reading time with."
2,Not Recommended,"The MarginIt seems as though all successful authors succumb to the pressures of getting a novel out just to satisfy contract obligations with their publisher. My humble impression is that's what happened here.This Stone Barrington novel has Holly Barker coming to New York to hunt down the alledged murderer Trini Rodriguez. Holly, associated again with Stone, a coincidence or is Woods desparate for new characters? Trini has somehow endeared himself to the FBI and he's shielded by the Witness Protection Program. As you can imagine, this complicates Holly's job. There is good action in parts of this novel, however it tapers off making the ending uneventful and rather disappointing.There are better mysteries out there.Marvin Wiebener, author of The Margin"
2,Please Bring Back the Plots!,"I don't even know where to start with this one, Stuart. Okay, so you've written a bunch of other books. Do I really need to be reminded of that every few pages with little asides that add nothing to the plot of this book? That just got me off to a bad start with this book. Second, I do not find the character of Stone Barrington to be even remotely likable; to me he comes off as a pompous ass with too much money and time on his hands. Third, the plot of this book seems very thin. It relies too heavily on plot lines from Woods' other books. This quote on page 236 sums up my whole experience with this book:Holly: ""...You think we're near the end of this?""Stone: ""God, I hope so. I'm not sure how much longer I can do it.""I'm going to go reread Palindrome - now there's a book which showcases Woods' ability for telling a great story. NOT this one."
3,Seems to be missing something...,"I recently finished Stuart Wood's latest, Reckless Abandon. While I like the Stone Barrington series, there seemed to be something missing in this one...Wood brings together Stone Barrington and Holly Barker, the character from the Orchid series. She's up in New York, tracking down a mobster who has committed a series of murders in her jurisdiction. He's still a killer, but now he's being protected by the feds under the witness protection program. She wants to somehow break that protection and see him brought to justice. Barrington is helping her out since she's staying with him and he's got the hots for her.I'm not sure what it is that's missing. Not enough action? Not enough mystery? Light on plot? I don't know. I just can't put my finger on it. It's an OK read, but I expected more..."
3,"Good read, but somewhat disappointing","The meshing of two series characters is always a difficult task, and as Stuart Woods' attempt to bring Holly Barker and Stone Barrington together and give them an interesting case to solve falls short of the usual Woods fare. The plot just doesn't inspire much tension or danger. The characters seem even less invested than the reader is led to believe. I got the feeling that Woods couldn't decide which series to write this time out, so he gave in to a misguided idea to give his fans a twofer. Setting up a new job for Holly Barker seems to be the most significant plot point, and even that isn't decided for certain by the end. Stone was simply a tool for Holly's ""reckless abandon"", also an effort that seemed less than imperative and more just a gimmick to get her to New York. As I read I kept expecting some huge revelation that would tie everything together, but in the end there are more unanswered questions than answered."
1,"I wish I could rate this ""0"" stars...","I once proudly claimed to be the biggest Stuart Woods fan in the world. After spending my hard-earned money on ""Reckless Abandon"" and wasting my valuable time reading it, I hereby promise to never again buy another book written by this author. Mr. Woods' work has gotten much too sloppy to enjoy and frankly, I'm surprised his publisher is still cranking out his books...don't these companies read the work before they go to print? Oh well, time to read the latest Clive Cussler novel..."
3,Reckless Abandon,"Not one of Stuart Wood's best books, but not one of his worst either. The tying together of Stone Barrington & Holly Barker has been hinted at in other books and Woods finally wrote a story to connect them both. He even brings Ed Eagle in from SANTA FE RULES so he is keeping us connected with his characters. If I had to choose 2 of Woods' books to recommend to another person, and I work in a library, those 2 books would have to be CHIEF and PALINDROME. Both are Woods at his very best. The rest are an entertaining diversion."
1,The Descent of a Good Writer Continues...,"Stuart Woods in his early novels was as good as it gets in popular contemporary fiction. Unfortunately, in order to keep his bank account on the plus side, he has now resorted to wiriting formula trash and not very good trash at that. It is a disappointment to see this, but better that the reader be forewarned than to simply ignore one of the more disappointing career implosions that I have had to witness. I have abandoned hope that this will change."
3,Skip it,"This was my first Stuart Woods novel and I wasn't impressed. Stone Barrington character is like James Bond and I never liked him. The whole story is just too unbelivable. I like something a little more realistic. Sorry, this just doesn't fly."
1,Who wrote this thing?,"This book reads like it was ghost written by Ian Flemming and P. G. Wodehouse. (Only not exciting and not funny.) True, there are characters named Stone and Holly. Only, this Stone is emotionless and Holly has become an airhead. Daisy is great, however. Maybe being dumped by Arrington way back when has finally destroyed his capacity for any real feelings. He is now just a cardboard cutout that this reader finds hard to care about."
1,Reckless is the right word!!!,"My wife and I have always loved the Stone Barrington novels. However, not this one. My wife read the book, and I listened to the unabridged audio CDs. She thought Woods brought too many of his previous characters together to do too many unrealistic things. HOW MANY TIMES CAN YOU TALK SOMEONE OUT OF KILLING YOU? I agreed with her, but I have to add more. The reader, Tony Roberts, is terrible. He sounds like he is 100 years old, and makes all the male characters sound the same. Except for Dino, who he makes sound like a cartoon character. Holly sounds like a dumb bimbo, and not the sharp minded law enforcement officer we have come to know and love. This guy, Roberts is horrible, and I will never purchase a book read by him ever again."
1,Reckless Abandon,"I also wish I could rate this book ""0"" stars. Woods use to be one of my favorite authors. Alas, no more. In his latest attempt to write, he has made Stone and Dino into standup comics. The dialogue is awful. I wonder how many DAYS it took him to write this book. Certainly no thought or real effort was put forth. How could someone write a masterpiece like Chiefs and fall to such a literary low in this book. Sorry Stuart, you have lost me as a reader. I will not purchase another book with your name on it."
3,OK Seat,"This seat serves its purpose, however I'd recommend buying another one. I bought it for the 4 in 1 benefit, however, it is difficult to get it stable in the car because of my minivan seat. A rolled towel helps, but doesn't always keep it in place."
2,I thought this would be the last car seat I needed,"I bought this car seat because it was supposed to be used for children up to 100 pounds and I thought it would be the last one I would need. My son is now 22 months old and he has outgrown the 5-point harness straps because they are not long enough and if he has a jacket on, I can't get them around him. He is too short and does not weigh enough for the shoulder belt system. It is adjusted at it's longest setting and it is too short. I had to buy a new car seat, I just got it in yesterday and it's 5-point harness system is so much better and fits kids until they are tall enough and weigh enough to go to the shoulder belt system. I now have a Graco seat and it is wonderful."
1,Pretty poor carseat.,"This carseat is hard to install with the booster still attached. The fabric is very cheap, and it melted in the dryer. I wash my carseats after every roadtrip, and it didn't even last one roadtrip before melting. It ripped the day that I got it trying to adjust the straps. I was very disappointed in this carseat. I would not purchase it again. I loved my previous carseats being the Alpha Omega, and a Graco. If you are looking for something cheap this is the product. There are other products out there that are in the same price range that would be better manufactured. Try those ones first. This is an awful carseat."
1,From a practical point of view,"As a practical man, I look at results and behaviors. I really don't care what people say, because you can always tell what people will do from what they've done. Looking at the results of social theories such as this, I see some 200,000,000 innocent individuals senselessly slaughtered in efforts to obtain a more perfect society. People who buy into these rubbish theories will continue to do what the Hitlers, Stalins, and Pol Pots have done in the past.Again as a practical man, I ask the same question I always ask: Who do YOU, mister socialist, trust to tell you what you need to know, where you can work, what you can own, what you may say, and when your body is no longer needed by the state?This book goes in the trash with all the other failed socialist theories."
3,Book was in great shape. good value!,"The Book, I bought 6 of them and they were in good shape, (got them timely too!)"
4,To Rise and Fall,"In Autobiography of My Dead Brother, Walter Dean Myers tells a unique tale of a friendship made and lost. When Jesse and Rise get into hot water, Rise is shot and Jess is forced to deal with the loss of his best friend. He soon finds many things out about himself he never knew.I certainly beleive that this book is a great read for anyone and it could teach everyone something about life. jesse is an example of how to overcome a struggle and young people could lear a lot from him and his strength. I really enjoyed this book and honestly believe i became a more powerful person because of it."
2,This book is extremely depressing. I couldn't get through it.,I wouldn't recommend this book. It is very sad and depressing. I couldn't get through it because it kept getting worse.
5,Great vocalese by Carmen McRae to Brubeck's tunes!,"This is a great record because Carmen sings lyrics to Brubeck standards, such as ""Take Five"" and ""It's A Raggy Waltz. I had never really listened to the LP, and had been looking for Brubeck CD's on eBay. This Japanese mini LP CD came up for bid, so I took a chance and won it. I really enjoy the performance! Close your eyes, and you are there listening to the Quartet with Carmen's great singing. The room noise adds to the ambience. This is a must for both Brubeck and McRae fans."
5,carmen mcrae the godess of jazz,"I i.0I have been a carmen mcrae fan for more than 40 years.In my opinion she is the greatest jazz singer in my era. To me she is the female equivalent of frank sinatra,in the way they both interpret the lyrics and make whatever they sing there own.especially on the ballads,they can make you cry and yet really swing on the fast tempo nunbers.I cannot believe that she does not have a fan club with all the fans that she still has.On the take five album there are 12 tracks,11 written by dave brubeck and 1 written by paul desmond and brubeck.The outstanding tracks are ""lord,lord"" ""there'll be no tomorrow"" in your sweet way"" melanatha"" ""it's a raggy waltz""all the other tracks are excellent too.it j o y"
2,Cheap sword rack,"The rack arrived in a timely manner, but I was completely dissatisified with it. There were no directions for assembly, and in trying to assemble it, I found that pre-drilled holes for screws were no alligned properly. Needing to drill several new holes was inconvenient.On eventual assembly,the screws split the composition board used for the rack, and the assembled rack was uneven/warped, needing adhesive to affix it to the wall to hold the swords."
4,Pretty Good,"A pleasant single. I guess my only real problem with the product is that there are only two songs on this CD, and, in my opinion, it's a little expensive for what you're actually getting. Both songs are absolutely wonderful, though. And, honestly, I would pay the same price again if I had to."
3,Decent Read on Lean,"This is a pretty lousy novel, having weak dialog and lacking any meaningful character development. However, it is a decent business book telling us the fictional story of one company's quest to become lean. Saying that it is ""a lean accounting novel"" is somewhat of a misnomer since it doesn't tell us much about lean accounting. Rather the book tells us more about accounting in a lean environment.The book has a fault common in many business books. Rather than compare two different business techniques done well, it compares a new technique with a well-established technique done poorly. When the company's problems with MRP are discussed, MRP is blamed for the problems, not the company's inept use of MRP. In the story, when the company lies to its MRP system, the MRP system is blamed, not the poor management of the system.Not enough time was spent on what lean is, and the theories and techniques of lean."
5,A novel or real world?,"Always thought that Lean stopped at the shop floor. Not only does Solomon's book open one's eyes to the opportunity to apply Lean in one's accounting approaches, but his ""novelette"" approach also explores the human side of creating change. Its a fast read, which leaves you with a solid understanding of the issues and the ""how to'."
3,A quick read and many good points,It has good points for accounting managers in businesses that allocate overhead traditionally. (I wish publishers would hire editors for these books.)
3,"A fast, easy way to learn about lean but NOT lean accounting",This book is very useful but it does NOT provide enough insight as to what accounting department's should specifically do to support lean. The book is more about making accounting lean instead of what accounting should specifically do to support lean.
5,simple,"OMG was extactly what i orderd, shipping was prompt, the Quick-Strut saved me hours of time, cheaper than what i could get locally, did not have to mess with compressing the springs which was MUCH safer and no specal tools needed. JUST MAKE SURE IT WILL FIT YOUR APPLICATION. and you need to get an alignment after."
4,Another solid album from Hindle,"James Hindle delivers another solid album filled with Alt-Country songs. Which is interesting as he is from England. He is joined on this album by members of The Ladybug Transistor, Vetiver, and Espers. Silence and Birthday Candle are among my favorite tracks. He had a song on The OC from his last album Prospect Park (which reminded me more of Neil Young's Harvest in sound and texture) and this seems to build off a slightly happier time in his life."
5,M Stinnett,"This has to be the best informational guide that I have found on preparing searching and hopefully obtaining a sports scholarship for my daughter. Coach Greg Slone offers not only a step by step process in order to reach your goal, he adds additional information that one could only get by going through the experience himself personally. I would highly recommend this guide to any parent that has sons or daughters looking for sports scholarships as well as coaches who have players with dreams of scholarships..."
4,Still Charmed,"Cute shirt with a nice graphic design. The red graphic really ""pops"" against the black background of the shirt. The shirt runs extremely small and is meant to be very form fitting. If you are built like Phoebe, Piper, or Paige, this shirt will fit you wonderfully."
5,2005 New York Times Almanac REVIEW,"This used book I bought, The New York Times Almanac 2005, was sold in perfect condition. It can't get any better than this."
5,save a little money,"I had a 2"" bike carrier but just bought an Edge which only took an 1 1/4"". For $30, this saved me a chunk of change over having to buy a new bike rack. I haven't towed anything heavy with it yet, though."
3,A worthy sequel,"Texasville is a worthy sequel to The Last Picture Show. It is ""trashy"" but I believe MacMurtry intended this. Not as strong or moving as "" Lonesome Dove"" or ""The Last Picture Show"" but an interesting portrayal of midlife in a stagnant smalltown. Several humorous moments and characters especially Bobby Lee and GG. My main beef with this book is the overboard dysfunctional characters littered thoroughout. I think Larry could have reeled in a bit on the outlandishness and the scenarios would feel more grounded and believable. Perhaps the extreme craziness was calculated but his stronger work, in my opinion, has storylines that you feel are possible. Still recommended."
2,Exhausting with not one likable character,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE Larry McMurtry. I think he has written half a dozen classics, at least. I had planned to read everything he has written; this book however, made me realize that some of his work is just trash. I found myself wanting to kill every character in the book and had a headache in the end. I suppose you could say he did get a reaction out of me, but shouldn't there be at least one character you care about? These same criticisms apply to The Evening Star, the sequel to Terms of Endearment. However, if you want to read a great novel, I highly reccomend several of his other works: any of the four Lonesome Dove books (although Streets of Laredo was a little weak), Some Can Whistle, Anything for Billy, Buffalo Girls, Pretty Boy Floyd, and Last Picture Show. I haven't read the others."
2,Tiresome,"I felt like a hamster on a flywheel reading this book. It had no beginning, no end, no character development, no story arc, no conflict--nothing that might make a reader want to turn the page. What there is is a lot of mind-numbing conversation between the main characters about sex. Most of the main characters from The Last Picture Show are there, but just barely. The book is really about Duane Moore, the good buddy of Sonny who used to be in love with Jacy. Sonny is almost nowhere to be seen in the book. Duane's wife Karla and long lost love Jacy seem to be placed there just to berate him at every turn about every aspect of his life, including his failing business. He accepts it all by eating humble pie at every turn, aw-shucking laconic answers to the point of tiredness and repetition. The book is set and written in the late '80's but feels very dated. McMurtry is a great writer--Lonesome Dove, The Berrybender stories--but this one you must skip."
3,Good if one reads the book first.,"One should read the book first. There are too many scenes that would live one confused otherwise. Not as X rated as The last picture show, which is good."
3,Second Book Following Duane,"Probably not a Last Picture Show, but we find Duane and his friends in mid-adulthood and things aren't going so well for any of them. A slice of life picture? Happiness seems to be eluding the characters, but we are held to the last page by McMurtry's clever treatment of plot and characters. Duane's Depressed, the last book of the series follows, and the reader feels compelled to continue the saga of Thalia's interesting and different citizens.Evelyn Horan - teacher/counselor/authorJeannie - A Texas Frontier Girl, Books One - Three"
5,Hilarious Sequel,"I thought this book was a knee-slapper. The characters are zany and enjoyable. I find that people who don't enjoy sequels - seem to be expect the same story as the original, just rehashed. McMurtry takes a bold step, and shifts the focus of the story on Duane and not Sonny. That is what makes this book true to life. Some of the people we know when they are young, don't necessarily pan out as adults. That is what has happened to Sonny. The hotheaded Duane has become rich. It's not really fair, but neither is life. Again, McMurtry shines in the little moments and breaks in his characters' lives. I found this book to be easier going than the final book in the trilogy, ""Duane's Depressed,"" even though it was a great book as well..."
1,TRASH,"Review guidelines limit the reviewer to one thousand words. In the case of Texasville, three will do. Trash, trash, trash."
3,yee-haw! + ho-hum,"Lots of fun. I read this shortly after ""The Last Picture Show"" and was pleasantly jolted by the contrasts between the two books, especially in tone and situation. The characters fumble with the same basic and pesky questions of sex, family, friendship, community... and boredom! ""The Last Picture Show"" laid these out as the challenges of coming-of-age. But ""Texasville"" wittily examines the way they haunt us into middle-age. Underneath the frenzy of spending sprees, sexual exploits, financial ruin, windstorms, and various melees, I found this a surprisingly poignant story of a group of people trying to figure out what to do with their lives and how to get along with each other."
1,Here's a more accurate product description,"Are you ready for a non-stop, in your face, horrible plot? ZIPPERFACE delivers! Watch as ugly women barely put up a struggle against a fiend who wears 200 zippers to terrify and stun his retarded victims. Chocked full with horrific writing, uninspired acting, and music that will make you want to die, ZIPPERFACE is a one of a kind trainwreck. Watching ZIPPERFACE will kill more of your brain cells than smashing your head into a brick wall. Get ready for the most horrible movie of all time, get ready for ZIPPERFACE!"
3,Excellent scenes mixed with slow section,There some excellent scenes in this episode. 1. Picard discribing the new holodeck programme to his colleagues and Crusher's reaction to his invitation. 2. The holodeck programme scenes until Redblock appears. The Picard/Crusher scene is quite funny.After that it slows down until picking up at the end.Also watch out for one of the worst continuity mistakes in a st-tng episode. Why is there no one outside the holodeck to greet them?
1,gimmicky title,the book is not the solutions for sedra's microelectronic circuits the title and the cover picture is all gimmicks
2,"cheap quality- get what you pay for, looks nice but don't look close","bought, installed , and after about 6 months took out and put in a standard lock. The unit was not meant for heavy use, just got stripped right away, the lock was too difficult for anyone to figure out, and then it stopped working. screws stripped easily also. Would work okay for a closet door that doesn't get used much...thats about it. they don't make em like they used to....."
3,"good, but its got nothing on lets get free","unfortunatley, most of this album is rapped over beats that we have all heard before. while this is usually what a mixtape is supposed to be, i just dont dig it. dp always struck me as a group that was too innovative to succomb to the cliche of spitting over recycled beats. also every track is way too short,(the longest track is by soulja slim w/o dp) therefore stic and m1 dont get a chance to elaberate on what they are talking about. i would love to know why (in detail) ""the white house is the rock house"" or ""george bush is way worse than bin laden is"" on Let's Get Free, they went into extreme detail, but unfortunatley on this album they dont. however turn off the radio is still laced with some really intelligent rhymes, and it is better than so much of the crap out there. ""radio programming is a figure of speech"""
5,"Remember Folks, This is a MIXTAPE","This album is obviously not as good as ""Let's Get Free"" which is one of the best hiphop albums of all time. But compared to all the other garbage out there it deserves a 5 STAR RATING. Otherwise, if their first album is a 5 then this would be a 3. Keep in mind that this is a mixtape, not a regular album. This is just a little something to hold the fans over cause we been antsy for some new stuff from dp. So their 2nd album is due out early 2003, tentatively Malcolm Xs b-day. Support dp, buy this mixtape. Unless you want fakers like Ja Rule to dominate."
5,A Rally Cry...keeps you moving,"I am a huge DP fan and this album did not disappoint....Let's be free was to put them out there and educate.....this album was more of a rally for a revolution....it was innovative for DP ...they used the knowledge of how brainwashed the music consumers are by beats but BS lyrics that's why DP recycled some beats and it made the whole album flow together......My favorites are ""It's War"", ""It was Written""(which is for the reggae fans) and ""Know your Enemy""....like I stated before for the TRUE DP fans out there,,,this album won't disappoint!"
2,If Judi wasnt there it would be great,"Well now I know why I was told I wont find a Jazzercise video that even comes close to a class! No one I have talked to (over 10 people now) can stomach the founder - if she would get over herself and let someone else do the videos she would make a much bigger fortune. She is awful.We all want to Hear the music, want to see the dance step. Somewhere in the process explain what they are doing, if it is a difficult move or they need to explain which muscles you are exercising and where you should feel it."
3,"Fun, but difficult for someone new to latin dance","This workout has a lot of potential because it actually looks like a lot of fun. But I'm not a dancer and I have zero experience with Latin dance moves. Cheryl is fun to dance with; I just wish there was a feature on this DVD where they slowly walk you through the moves. I even tried to play the video in slow motion, but just couldn't get certain moves down. I was also unfamiliar with the ballroom dance terms used to the video. (Perhaps part of the problem was that this was my first time trying Jazzercise; I don't know.) In the end, I just tried to follow along and keep moving, but I really wanted to know how to do the moves properly. Judi, the founder, is pretty annoying and her arms flying everywhere when she's leading her segments of the workout is pretty distracting. I'll try this workout a few more times, but if I can't figure out the moves after a few more tries, I'll probably quit and move onto something else."
5,Eerie tales that walk the line of darkness,"Devil Talk: Stories is an anthology of Latino short fiction, laced with men and women encountering evil, drama, even humor amid the everyday life of Chicano and Meixcano culture. Author Daniel A. Olivas, published in numerous anthologies and literary journals including ""The MacGuffin"" and ""The Pacific Review"", presents his wickedest work in these eerie tales that walk the line of darkness, from a botched robbery with deadly consequences on the same day that JFK is buried to a young man's preternatural ability to see exactly what his girlfriend is doing when he is away. An enthralling collection; the stories are so tantalizing that they are best devoured all at once."
5,A Great Gift for a Pool Enthusiast,"I recently got these balls for my boyfriend's home pool table. He noticed the quality of the balls from the first break. With these balls, pool becomes a game of finesse, not power, and shots with English are much more consistent as the balls react much more predictably. On a shot with draw, he was able to draw the cue ball across the table on a shot that with a lower-quality cue ball would have just drawn it a foot.The color of the balls is also very rich and bright, making it easy for even a non-player to appreciate the workmanship!"
2,Extremely poor or outdated instructions.,"This is an excellent product but whoever wrote or approved these instructions should be terminated. The sizes they give for the bolts are all wrong, lots of wasted time back and forth to the tool box. There is a seal that goes around the inlet next to the wheel well that is never even mentioned in the instructions. You find that out when your done and find an extra piece.By that time it is too late to put it on without removing everything you just spent an hour installing.We won't even mention the mispelled words or words with letters just plain missing.Read other reviews on other websites, lots of the same reviews regarding the instructions. Volant is either too lazy or stupid to correct them."
1,I am tired of Political Correctness,"I am tired of Political Correctness. I am tired of even hearing that term. Do we now have to distort, truncate, alter and omit events in our own History to please some unknown enigmatic entity or group that we can not even define? Political Correctness is a name for a witch-hunt in my opinion. The witch-hunt in this case is a quest not to offend. Offend whom? Our selves? We are all Americans in this country. People of all races, color and creed died to preserve our American Heritage and freedoms that no other country in the world can equal. This book would have you think otherwise."
1,Fails The Emma Goldman Test,No mention of Emma Goldman. The American Century by Harold Evans is a much better book.
4,"Interesting, Entertaining, Republican Political Slant","I'm an adult attempting to brush up on American history and found this book very informative and interesting. I do believe it has a fairly right-wing Republican political slant, but the author is thoughtful and detailed in his personal views. I would recommend reading more than one political view of the Franklin Roosevelt Presidency, for example, in order to get a broader,truer understanding."
5,As good as it gets,"I have most of this music on vinyl, and I really had no desire to buy all of them again on CD, so for $20 this is the best you are going to get. Other than that, it's difficult to expand on the numerous glowing reviews found here other than to confirm what has already been said as being true."
4,Almost perfect....almost,Not bad retrospective of Genesis. Could have use a little more older tracks with the classic Genesis line up. Pretty close to being a Phil Collins greatest hits collection.Good for those who only came on board after Peter Gabriel left the band.
4,A good collection for the begginers like me!!!!!!,"I never care about Genesis, so I decided to try to listen to them so I just bought this collection. I like it!. My favourite cd was the second one! songs like Abacab, Turn it on again, makes me wants to hear this cd over and over"
2,Must-Have For Fans Of Any Period Of Genesis? Why?,"I consider it as another one attempt to get to our wallets and sell us the same thing again.""Turn It On Again"", right, guys? ;)""Must-Have For Fans Of Any Period Of Genesis?""Com'on! Why?I don't need Collins-era poppy 3-cords songs even for free!And I already have all ""classic"" Genesis albums already, all of them are remastered editions, and some of them in mini-LP sleves.So, why do I pay $29 for the same songs again, even if I consider myself a ""classic"" Gabriel & Hackett-era Genesis fan?Are Collins, Banks and Mike The Mechanicare suffering from lack of money and need some support from fans? Nope! They sold enough ""gold records"" in 80th!If you want to support Gabriel and Hackett financially, just buy their solos!"
3,Easy Listening for the old person,"I like Genesis, but i forgot how cheesy some of their songs are, it's a good collection if your into ""easy listening"". The third disk of this three disk set is total garbage from the real early days."
5,Genesis galore!,"This collection is a must for Phil Collins fans, and even more of a must for those who enjoy (and miss) the classic Genesis sound. You'd have to spend a lot more to get a better collection of songs (there's 40 tracks). Well worth the money."
3,Intro to Genesis - the studio route,"I suppose this collection is for the person who doesn't have any Genesis albums (or has just one or two), but who has always liked what they heard (and knows what they like) on the radio, and who is willing to pay a little more than the price of ""Turn It On Again - The Hits.""My suggestion to the first-time Genesis buyer has always been to get the first three live albums (""Live,"" ""Seconds Out,"" and ""Three Sides Live""), and if you really, really like the mid-to-late eighties songs, get both volumes of ""The Way We Walk."""
3,Too many errors,"One thing which really annoys me about this book is the number of errors. This book has em all, incorrectly labeled diagrams, inconsistencies in units of measurements-half the time the author uses feet and the rest meters makes it a very frustrating experience trying to do comparisons.For some reason, this module of the MCSE suffers from a lack of good books, there doesn't seem to be anything better out there!"
2,"Save your money, there are better books on the topic","I was quite disappointed with the book. While it covers the main topics well, it contains numerous errors and does not even include some material covered in the review questions.An example of a glaring error (though minor)is that both in Chapter 1 and in a review question, the authors state that scanners can be shared over a network. This is simply not correct.More troubling is that the answers to some of the review questions cannot be found in the book! The answer given in the back of the book is correct, but there is no way you would know the answer if this book was your only resource.It is a matter of the book not covering the subjects in as much detail as the review questions require.Since there are many other books on the market that cover this exam, I recommend choosing another."
4,"A lot of factual knowledge, could be more Real World","The truth is that it is a very good book. Well written, easy toread, great review questions and the CDs also have some interestinginfo on it, even though they are demos. It is, however, missing a little of real world info. For example in Ch.4 it mentions 100VG-AnyLAN. The only place I have seen that is in this book. I had to research to find out that it was implemented by one University some years ago but no one else uses it. It did not mention that in the book at all (that it was not widely used). I also agree that it needs to be used in conjunction with the other books that form the set if you plan to actually take the exam..."
2,It is lacking in many areas,This book lack many topics if you are using it for the exam. It also is lacking in the Index section as well as term definitions. Use it as a sup to other materials.
3,Not really enough ...,"This book is really not enough for the MCSE - Networking Essential examination! It is only suitable for beginner to have a study about networking, but for the exam purpose, you must use other books to help, for example MCSE core exam in a Nutshell."
2,Scanty Material,"I found this book to be vague and not nearly satisfying. It only touches on critical network components, especially for anyone who wants to understand what's going on in the wiring closet and patch panels. The info on WAN technologies is barely there, the section on line signalling confusing. I used all Sybex books to get my MCSE (I did get it, in the end) but the books were very little help and I'm not planning on wasting my money on another Sybex title when I found them to be so generally useless."
1,DO NOT USE THIS AS ONLY SOURCE TO PASS TEST!,Just to confirm what many have already said:I used this book as a single source to take the test. I am NOT a beginner with computers. I failed the test -- TWICE.
2,Not A Beginner's Guide,"The major benefit of this book is that it is an easy read. It will not put you to sleep like most books on this topic. This text should be used as a reference for people that are already familiar with networking principles. It is very basic and will assume that you already understand certain principles. As a beginner I had a hard time with this book. After taking a networking class and actually doing some hands-on networking, I have no problem reading this book and understanding it. One other drawback is that it does have several errors. Overall: There are better books out there on the topic."
4,Networking essentials book (Sybex),"Very informative yet it seems Microsofts exams are still a few steps ahead of it. Explanations and examples seemed extremely general, especially the troubleshooting tools. More detail needs to be added to each chapter and item. And give us the answers to the real world scenarios! True/false questions, forget it, pointless. More scenario based questions. Overall very well written and extremely helpful."
3,"Good overall, excessive amount of errors, easy questions","This Sybex book has overall good coverage of the topics that the MOC covers. However, the book lacks in the area of technical accuracy, with a very long list of known errors and approx. 15 other errors that I submitted for review. The book also contradicts itself many times. The SYBEX Net Ess study notes (0782122914) offers more concise reading with reasonable scope in half the length. It is a better prep tool. I would still like to see harder questions than the ones in both these books, as they offer little indication of the difficultly level of ms tests."
4,"boring reading, but has all the facts you'll need","First test I took and passed easily. This text with Exam Cram and MCPPREP practice test software made test 70-58 a ""no sweat"" experience."
3,Book is okay.....but,"Don't take this exam as your first. Matter of fact, don't even take this exam until you've completed TCP/IP and Enterprise, the material is simply too vast to grasp as a beginner. The OSI model and information about network equipment, cabling, ethernet and token ring is pretty good, but the WAN stuff, like X.25, Frame Relay, ATM is VERY weak. Look elswhere for this because the test will cover it. Also expect some WINS and maybe other TCP/IP stuff...in other words take TCP/IP first."
2,Basic Information,"I was very disappointed with this book. The information covered in the book was not helpful in preparing for the Networking Essentials exam. The book covered basic terminology, concepts that can be found in other books with less errors. I would not recommend this book in preparing for the Networking Essentials exam."
3,"Hard core technical, but Test Success is better for techo's","I have read into the Study Guide and found that it is full of interesting facts, this is good if you have ZERO knowledge of the product from start, but if you have some technical background i.e you can tell a toaster from a hub, then the better book is: Sybex Networking Essentials - MCSE Test Success it breaks it down to simple language and has all those fun filled hours of questions at the end of each chapter plus a final review at the end of the book but NO STOCK fillings.. most manufactorers like New Ryders and Sybex etc seem to think that Fatter is better, well I don't have 6 months to read the book so a comprehensive and effective Slimmer training guide focused on the Exam and the subject is better than just Subject orientated. So, this book is good for Winter escapes but Test Success is better for the piece of paper without compromising reasonable understanding."
4,Net Essentials in words you can understand,"Two people were studying for the Net Essentials exam. One bought the Sybex the other the official Microsoft counterpart. Both of us used Transcender exams. Sybex passed on the first attempt with a 896 the other borrowed the Sybex and passed on the second attempt. Both of us work on a large NT 4.0 WAN. It is not that this book has more content, but it's wording is much more understandable."
2,no good,"this book is very confusing and had some errors on many pages. very poorly organized. i had real hard time understanding matterials. i read other books (new riders) and found them a lot more helpful. i passed the exam on the first try after one month of study. i didn't know anything about networking prior to this book. I read this book about 3 times, but, i came to conclusion that this book did a little to help me pass the exam. my thanks goes to New Riders book, not this one."
3,you'll need more than this book alone to pass the exam,"I purchased the whole core series of these books, and read the NetEss book once, over a week, followed by Microsoft's own publication. I took MANY test exams, and went to a 2-day school. All this over a 2-3 week period. I did not pass the test. Not even close!! I suppose it helps to know that I have very little prior knowledge of networks, and no hands-on experience to speak of. So, coming from a different field to the IT industry is more than a 'quick-cram'. I hope to take the NetEss exam again AFTER I take the NT 4 exams. I have heard that's recommended??"
4,Get this book if you want to pass the exam!,"This was the only title I read and I passed the exam first time with 896. There are lots of mistakes in this book...grammatical AND factual, so try and get the errata from the Sybex site. Supplement this book with the MS Prep Exams and 'Braindumps' from the net and you will pass no problem!"
4,"Good study guide, but use in conjunction with sample tests",The book provides a good structure for self instruction. Each section ends with a quiz and a re-print of all quiz questions with answers is included in an appendex at the end. This was very useful. I would strongly recommend using it in conjunction with sample / practice MCSE exams. The Transcender exams were closer to the real thing than the MSPEP. The CD that comes with book is not of much use.
5,"It's just like SNL, only a lot funnier!",A very clever and extremely fun read. This graphic-novel is a MUST-HAVE for all SNL's 'TV FUN-HOUSE' fans. It has all the elements that we have come to love and expect from 'TV FUN-HOUSE' plus more great stuff that SNL cannot broadcast over network television!
4,Liked it very much!,"Fairy tale type books aren't really my style, but this was was really cool. I think that anyone who like this series should buy this book! It had kind of a twist at the end, which is cool. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it was predictable what was going to happen. I would reccommend this book if you like the series, if you like fairy tales, or if you like story ending twists! Enjoy!"
2,"good sound, powerful, but somewhat complicated","First, the power button on the front panel did not work, then power up the remote control. try again turned on or off from the front panel without success.LED power indicator does not work either.in terms of sound is excellent, clear and strong, good power, the sound effects are great, but the menus are complicated"
3,Great Music High Price,I loved the music but after buying the CD for a high price I found the music was available for less money on other Woodstock CD's. Also the other Woodstock CD's were studio versions which I prefer.
4,replacing cassettes,"For whatever reason, I bought this on cassettes when it first came out. The incredible difference in recording quality is enough to make it worthwhile, without regard to how long cassette players (and the tapes) may survive. A major marker of history."
3,"Where can I get a full version of 10 Yrs After's ""I'm Going Home""?","Does any one know where I can get a full, unedited version of Ten Years After's ""I'm Going Home"" rendition at Woodstock?"
4,Well i like the movie but...,i loved the movie but number one is that janis joplin wasn't even on here and neither was the who!!! the movie didn't have one thing either! and that was vollunteers by jefferson airplane! for god sake put what was at woodstock on the damn cd!Jacoby
3,Times change. You can never go home again.,"No one was more enthusiastic about this music and the values that it represented than I was. I suppose that's the key here. The values were valid, still are, but the music was actually fairly poor for the most. As a historical document this CD is valuable, but don't expect to enjoy it like you did the music then, no matter what you're smoking."
3,"John Sebastian ... ""far-out!""?","I keep listening to this cd version & wondering why it seems different to me than the original 3 disc vinyl from the seventies. Where is the studio version of CSN&Y's ""Woodstock"" that opens the film!? Was that on the vinyl? I loved the Wavy Gravy stuff about, ""People we got the Times, we got the times ..."" and Max Yasgur, ""I'M A FARMER!"" But wasn't there a long, ""far-out"", announcement from John Sebastian about a baby being born at the site? And him going-on, hippy-dippy, about how that baby was gonna be ""far-out!"" That's been cut from the DVD too. Why, I wonder ... the dialogue was such an important signature of the event. Did the producers decide, 30 years later, that some of that drug/high dialouge was really just embarrasing or what? I wonder. Anyone know what I'm talking about?"
3,Modiano Cards,"Good cards for the money - not my absolute favorite, but an OK value. No complaints. Delivery was prompt."
5,Brit is the BEST!!!!,"""Don't let me be the last to know"" is one Brit's greatest songs ever! I highly recommend it to anyone who loves Brit's singing!"
4,A classic Britney ballad,"When this track was first released I have to admit that I wasn't overly impressed, but then again we have come to expect a high class in pop songs from Britney. Although perhaps not one of the best singles, this is a competent ballad that works great as an album track but unfortunately not so as a single. There were several other slow tracks on 'Oops...I Did It Again' that would have served better commercially, such as 'Where Are You Now'.Then again, it's certainly not a bad song and it's not as slushy as half of pop ballads out today. I think it was mostly down to that awful video."
1,Please let me be the last to know!,"As I sit here and read the reviews on this CD, it makes me wonder if I was hearing the same song as these people..but I know what I heard and I didn't like it one bit..I didn't even like this song when I was a fans of hers. I think she sounds way too whiny for my taste. I can't believe this was even made into a single. Sorry, but this is a waste and Britney can think she's all good, but she's not and never will be. There's a LOT better than her!"
1,here's the facts......,"ok. heres exactly what i think:1. brittany may b pretty, but she CANT(i repeat) CANNOT sing!2. all her songs have a BAD BAD message.3. you shouldnt waste your money on this girl.you can push the button that makes my review not helpful. as long as you have read it and considered what i think of this cd, then fine. happy shopping!"
4,FaceMask required,"This stuff is probably very good, however, it is a very fine powder and gets everywhere. You definitely need a face mask when using it and I would actually just prefer to use a liquid sprayer than trying to work with this stuff."
3,Not sure if it worked,"I purchased this product from Ace Hardware Store and it was so poorly packaged that half of its contents spilled in the box. I used what I had left (approx half bottle) in my knock out roses and another flowering bush whose branches are infested with a green, scaly like fungus. The spots on the knock out roses are gone but the green fungus on the flowering bush is not. I think is working because I see less fungus on the bush branches but I am not sure. I will be trying a different type of fungicide on this and other plants and trees I have infected with the same type of fungus. Needless to say, I think this product works and as far as Ace Hardware Store is concerned, I will not purchase their online products in the future."
3,Ex Whitesnake + ex Little Caesar,"Manic Eden might not be that well known because in a way it certainly looks like a side project to Whitesnake, while David Coverdale were busy elsewhere. 3/4 of Manic Eden are ex Whitesnakers - Adrian Vandenberg (guitar), Rudy Sarzo (bass) and Tommy Aldridge (drums). Together with singer Ron Young from Little Caesar the band released only one ignored album in 1994. It's a shame that this album never gained any attention because it's a solid rock effort certainly worth to be checked out. Even though the rock tunes are good, the ballads ""Do angels die?"", ""Dark shade of grey"" and ""Ride the storm"" are even better. If you like Little Caesar you'll absolutely like Manic Eden's blues based hard rock.. Put up 14 bucks and take a chance - sometimes musical curiosity pays!"
4,This should of sold bucket loads,"Yep, it should of in the humble opinion of this scribe. Straight away you know you've made the right choice when the lead cut of 'Can You Feel It' warbles out of your speakers. Other tracks just build on this good start. It's Adrian Vandenberg on guitar so you know that area is covered - but the rest of the band are pretty darn tasty too - drumming, vocals and bass and it all makes for a great album.In fact you don't have to be into hard rock to like this album at all. It's a great rock 'n' roll album you can play in most company, no screaming, not too much in the way of squeeling guitars. It's just a solid album. By the way - check out the back catalogue of Vandenburg too - though it is a little 80's tinged if you get my drift.And definitely an album to throw on while driving down the highway too."
5,hard rock blues de primera!!!,"increible album con una de las mejores bases ritmicas del rock conformada por rudy sarzo y tommy aldridge (ozzy osbourne, project: driver) aunados al virtuosismo de adrian vandenberg (vandenberg, whitesnake) y el estilo aspero de ron young(little caesar) este grupo nos ofrece una joya del hard rock-blues con tintes ala hendrix/zeppelin que te quitaran el aliento!!"
3,For open minded Adrian fans only,"I am an Adrian Vandenberg fan and I was expecting to hear music in the style of his original group Vandenberg or Whitesnake. I guess I should have paid more attention to Adrian's cover art, because he must have split guitar personalities. His alter ego must be Jimi Hendrix on this project.Because the 70's blues rock genre has been covered by so many before, it's vital to re-interpret the style in a new context and play with conviction to create something that sounds like your own (""Can You Feel It"", ""Gimme A Shot"" and ""Fire In My Soul""). But it's easy to fall into clichés and recycle old licks that sound forced (""Do Angels Die"", ""Dark Shade of Grey"" and ""Ride The Storm"") and uninspired.The 3 Whitesnake members of the band are all top notch musicians. Ron Young is a decent sounding singer, but his range, lyrics and vocal melodies really hold the songs back. This CD is for open minded Adrian fans only."
1,Buyer Beware!,"This review simply serves to assist anyone who may be looking for more of the awesome, cutting-edge hard rock music that Vandenberg put out in the '80's. I recently purchased this CD-hoping for more great Vandenberg hard rock, or maybe a new twist. The musicianship is excellent, as all of the band are talented and prodigious in the hard rock genre. The letdown is that although the production is A-1, the musical compositions are trite, dull, ""been there, done that"" stuff that really is not imaginative or interesting. These guys are capable of so much more! The guitar work is more like Kings X, with definite Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn influence-moments of brilliance, but mostly musical themes you have heard before. The music is OK; it is just not great. And for any fans of Adrian Vandenberg's artwork, the cover art is substandard as well-my kids could do better with a box of crayons. Proceed with caution...I have a copy I will let go of very cheap! Thanks for reading-John"
5,excellent!!!,"this is the biggest ilustrator of the world,you'l never been disappointing with this book, a great gift for desing artist!"
2,Not Enough Information,"I ordered this because I had visited Teotihuacan and wanted an informative DVD. I did not realize this was only ten minutes long. It does not have enough information and did not show enough of the site or its artifacts. It is not worth the money. I also ordered the other Teotihuacan DVD on Amazon: ""Teotihuacan: City of the Gods"" (EVN). This one cost more but is much better. It is almost 20 min. and although the commentary is somewhat ""dry"", it is very informative and more of the site an its artifacts are presented."
2,Very simple,"Although there are many different subjects on this book, it is very superficial and do not explain the points. It seems like a powerpoint presentation."
2,Very shallow,"If you are looking for good reference book, this is not it. The book shows the topics but they are treated very superficially, you cannot even find a good complete example. I do not recommend it if you are looking for a serious decision analysis book."
2,Bof...,It's very only basics. First year graduate school level and useless for a real specialist. But can be interesting for someone who wants just an overwiev.
2,boring...,"It is a snooze feast. Even if you do risk management the book reads like quantum physics in that it looks good in print but how do you prove it in the real world.A very good text book, a really bad business book."
4,A Searing Read...,"and should be required for married couples to read together. It should make for some fascinating conversation.Tolstoy adopts a scorched-earth policy in this novel which deflates the ""sanctity"" of marriage. The protagonist is a man on the edge, and it seems Tolstoy was there with him in the writing of this incandescent novella.Chris McCandless, the ill-fated Alaskan voyager who died in a hunting shelter while trying to escape the ties of civilization, was reading this novel very close to his death. See the nonfiction ""Into the Wild"" for information on this...I'm sure most of you have read the other two selections in this anthology, so I'll limit my comments to Kreutzer. This novel made my pulse race, a physical reaction I haven't had to a novel in quite a long time."
3,"It's not really about murder, just about the lack of love","It is difficult to relate to the main character, not just for what he did, but because his reasons are no longer applicable in the way people live today and engage into relationships. Nevertheless, its insight about how a marriage could very easily become a living hell while both parties pretend that nothing is going on, may very well be reflected in today's average person experience."
4,"You like a window seat, an isle seat, or by the murderer?",Imagine yourself sitting by a murderer on the way of a long trip by the train and a guy starts talking to you. You realize that he is a killer of his own wife and he wants to tell you all about the murder. But Tolstoy illustrates the compassion of the murderer and it really moves people. Perhaps bringing with book with your next trip is a good idea.
2,PENGUIN GIVES AWAY THE CLIMAX ON BACK COVER,"It's unforgiveable that Penguin gives away the climax of ""Kreutzer Sonata"" on the back cover of the book. Also, who wants to read an inept critique, such as the one on the back cover, in advance of reading the story. The stories themselves are not Tolstoy at his best. Much better spending one's time reading ""Anna Karenina"" or ""War and Peace"" in the Maude translations. These late period stories are like bad Dostoyevski, the author well past his prime."
4,As a suggestion....,"If you are looking to read the classics from a different perspective, this is an interesting story to read from a feminist theoretic perspective. I highly recommend reading ""Intercourse"" by Andrea Dworkin, as she includes an analysis of ""The Kreutzer Sonata"" in her book that provides a complex view of this story. Very interesting."
1,Tolstoy was an idiot,"Let me caveat this review: I only have read the title story, and my review is based entirely on that.This story was truly awful. It is an overlong, relentlessly endless, uber-puritanical tirade. Tolstoy was, at least at this point in his life, an unbelievable prude, and this is a master treatise on prudery. If you think that sex is evil, always, every time, even within the bounds of marriage, this story is for you. Otherwise, there's not much here. The 'story' such as it is, is paper thin, despite the awfully large number of words it takes him to tell it.Finally, if you are a Beethoven fan, and were interested in this story because of the piece in the title (as I was), forget it. The sonata itself gets only scant mention in one place, and was hardly worth titling the story after."
3,Too much drill - Not enough driver,"I used my old DW955 for all-around construction. That drill had only 2 speeds slow for setting screws and faster for drilling. It started to intermittently quit on me after several years usage.I bought a new DC925KA as a replacement. I won't use the hammer drill function everyday but for a few bucks more it was worth the ""insurance"" if and when I needed it.This unit on slow speed HAS NO CLUTCH. Almost useless as a driver.The other 2 speeds (which for my money are insignificantly different) both offer the clutch.Lots a power for drilling though.If your main usage for this tool is 50% drilling and 50% setting screws your wasting your money.Also when shifting from 1 speed to another be prepared to get it into the next gear with a small amount of power. Almost like double clutching for you old stick shift guys.I'm getting my DW955 repaired and you may find my DC925 on eBay."
1,Bad product.,"I've had my XRP tools for a couple of years now. They have all been exposed to light/occasional duty around the house. Outside of a little paint and minor scuffs you wouldn't know they were more than a couple of months old. The batteries have become nearly useless for anything but brief work and today the drill outright quit. I have just spent nearly an hour trying to contact DeWalt to no avail. Apparently customer service is a game to them. I recommend not buying this product. Go with Black and Decker instead, at least it lives down to expectations."
3,Homeowner Grade Tools,"I had this drill for a year and it didn't run true right out of the box. Than the chuck went, installed a new one, than the switch went and after seeing the price of that I just tossed it out. I'm a contractor so my tools get heavy use and after using Dewalt for many years I'm finally tossing them aside. They just don't hold up to real use.Dewalt does have decent power and that's about all I can say for them anymore."
3,Powerful but a bit confusing,"I bought this drill to replace my 15 year old trusty Makita 12volt cordless. For outright raw power I think it's great. If you're out there driving a single size screw or drilling through just about anything, it will do a good job. With adjustments for clutch, speed, and (confusing) a feature for screwing or drilling or hamerdrilling, it is versatile, no doubt. However, that's where my praises end. First, it is heavy....not a big thing if you're drilling or screwing straight down. My job, as a garage cabinet installer, calls for veried angles, however, and it can be cumbersome. The other gripe I have is that I have to make sure I have all three adjustments correct if I switch from a 3"" screw to a 3/8"" drill bit. Personally, I'd buy the Makita again if I had it to do all over again."
2,You don't need this monster,"Too big, too long, too heavy and too loud. Why buy this?? I have not had much better experience with Milwaukee either, because of its batteries, and this is why I cannot recommend any specific one but I do know you don't have to put up with this moster. If you use it for infrequent drilling, use a corded one. If for driving, it is useless. I wasted my money."
3,Good Address Book,"If you're just looking for a flat file address book, you'll love Act. But if you really looking for contact management functionality, try Goldmine for about the same price. Goldmine has a steeper learning curve, but has amazing reporting, tracking, and automation features. It can pull leads off the Web and assign contact to ""tracks"" so you never forget anyone."
2,buggy resource hog,"A longtime ACT fan, I upgraded to 6.0 for the email integration and library tab. They don't work unless I turn off scripting protection in Norton AntiVirus - tedious at best and I'm unwilling to leave it turned off. The ACT for Palm feature, the other item that sold me, is very limited - for example shows me only the primary contact for a given company.The real problem is the bugs. It causes unrelenting problems on my XP system. I have 1 GB of RAM and a 2.8 processor! Yet somehow it manages to cause memory shortages and locks up regularly. I've almost stopped using it because it's as much an annoyance as help. I've never had a software program that I evaluate before launching: do I have time for a lock up? NONE of my other software programs cause these kinds of problems, and I run some heavy-duty graphics programs.I'm at the point of looking for another contact manager, which is too bad because I was a solid ACT user for so many years."
2,OK for database novices,"I administer and use ACT at our 10 employee company. They used ACT before I came to the company so I am not to blame for choosing it as a solution. The program is built from Access so if you might be better off just going with that program. There is a steeper learning curve but you will not be slowed down by features you wont use.ACT does provide features you might want connected to your contact DB, like email and sales tools. If you choose to go with this almost turnkey solution understand that the program will probably lock up regularly if more than one user connects to it. And it is slow. But I would recommend for a single user without database experience."
1,Not for Windows 7,"I bought Act 6.0 for my new computer. I've been using this version of Act since 2004 and love it. I once upgraded to Act 7 and hated it and went back to 6.0. Unfortunately, Act 6.0 is a 16 bit product which won't work in a 64 bit system. So my purchase was for nothing and it wasn't the fault of the guy who sold it to me, so I'm eating the $55 it cost me. Lesson learned: next time ask the bit size."
2,Disappointing,"I switched from a Mac as my main platform a couple of years ago, and had to abandon InTouch and NowContact. For a while I used an Excel spreadsheet and AOL's address book, but decided to buy ACT as it seemed to be the Windows leader. I use a laptop and desktop, and have been disappointed by the cumbersome interface, data synchronization, need for two copies of Act for two computers (when I obviously never use both at the same time - note Intuit's response to this issue), and lack of integration with AOl mail. My guess is that I will never fully implement ACT."
3,Has been surpassed,"My three star review is no criticism of Dirac - after all, he is the pioneer of the theory of Hamiltonians with constraints and as such deserves all the credit that is due. However I would like to redirect you to Henneaux and Teitelboim's book on quantization of gauge systems since they have done much to clarify the mathematics behind the theory and I think give a better introduction to the field than Dirac's dated book."
3,Read more modern stuff,This book may be beautiful for those who love history of scienceI find it inaccessible and much a modern approache facilitates a thourough understanding of this advanced topicFeynman and other writers as wellas those describing Feynmans achievements are far better reads.
2,Flimsy!,This product was very flimsy! The roof of the house would not even stay on. It is for a small hamster and mine was a little too big!I definately would not buy it again!!
3,Racism toward white people....not like Lopez,"I love George Lopez and every stand up comedy he has ever done up to this one. I have to admit, I was a little offended. He really talked down on white people. I am white and am not prejudice whatsoever, but I really didn't care for this comedy this time. Other than the racist comments, it was awesome."
3,What happened George,"My husband and I love his last stand up but this one wasn't very funny, it was just crude."
3,Solid entry in ethnic standup,"Like Carlos Mencia, Mr. Lopez mines ethnic stereotypes not just of Mexicans (Mariachi music, illegal immigration, drinking, crime) but also of mostly-hypothetical WASPs (BlackBerries, Bluetooths, feng shui, Starbucks). There's plenty of jokes about how Mexicans do all the dirty work Americans supposedly won't do (""Do you know who's rebuilding New Orleans? FEMA - Find Every Mexican Available"").But Mr. Lopez actually shows pretty good range -- it's not just jokes based on ethnic stereotypes, but also matters as diverse as hirsute grooming, family problems and growing up poor. He's actually funniest when he talks about the differences between his childhood and children growing up today: ""Do you know what our `Lunchables' was? Two weenies on a fork, over a stove!"" Overall, he has a few laugh out loud moments and is worth the time to watch, if not to purchase."
1,Believe the Reviews,We usually enjoy the jokes and sense of humor of George Lopez but not this time. We were not offended by any part of it but did not have the gut-busting laughs he usually provides.
5,Solo-Duo featuring Kenny Drew,"Kenny Drew is in a rather pensive mood during this recording. He is, however, ""in his element"" and accompanied by ""his"" bassist (when accompanied). If you enjoy LISTENING to music rather than simply being entertained, this is the old master at his finest. If simply don't get any better than this!"
2,So-so quality,"Product was not packed very well, box had come apart in shipping, no padding inside. Screw knobs to attach BBQ to pedestal base unable to be fully tightened because of flange being too close to holes. I had to bend the flange out flat with vice grips. The threading on the screw knobs is out of whack, cannot tighten them by hand. Looks good, great idea for attaching to swim platform, just poor quality control. Would not recommend this product."
2,Common Sense and one-liners,"Don't be fooled by the 160 pages. There are only one or two lines of text on each page. They might be helpfull in a relationship, as far as ""little things you can do"" but it is not a book about marriages or relationships."
4,Money Well Spent,"I bought the ARC for $1 at the library book store. I had no idea what it was about or what to expect. But since I love the young angsty man genre, and the cover brought this to mind, I made the splurge. This would have better fit the almost-young confused man genre, which is a new one for me. William Brandt's writing is funny and unexpected. The story could have been cliche but the self-deprecating, first person narrative gave it a fresh twist. Brandt was expert at bringing the reader into his protagonist's head. I wasn't always sure that's where I wanted to be, but since the ride was so enjoyable I stuck with it until the end. And I'm glad I did. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up."
1,Horrible Quality DVD - Good Movie,"Don't buy this DVD distributed by Polart. It looks as if someone setup a video camera and then videotaped the movie playing on a cheap TV. You can actually see the TV scan lines in the picture. Plus the colors are washed out to a dull uniform gray, and the picture is literally crooked on the screen (their video camera wasn't pointed directly at the TV, but was off to the side somewhere).If you can get a copy of the Polish release, you'll see this movie with the colors and picture intact. But you will not get subtitles. That's the only reason to buy this Polart release.NOTE: Polart recently remastered these DVDs. I took a chance and purchased the new ones - they are greatly improved. Still not the highest quality, but worth buying."
5,Fun to have!,Purchased these with the Nostalgic hot dog toaster and the red checked basket liners. They are a present that I can't wait to give:)
4,Mikasa wine glasses,"These are lovely cut glasses, each with its own individual design. For my taste, they are a little heavy to hold but that just encourages less wine poured into them."
5,"""Cheers"" to Mikase!","Lovely, FUN goblets! They seem delicate, but we love them. Due to their size, they may not be for everyone."
5,Absolutely stunning...and HUGE.,"I bought these for my dad on his birthday, and when he opened them, he went wild! He's a complete wino, so it's a perfect gift for anyone who can appreciate beautiful wine glasses. The etching on the sides of the glass is elegant and tasteful, but the style is also very modern. They're also honestly the BIGGEST wine glasses I've ever seen, so I wouldn't fill them up too far. Highly recommended, and great for the price!"
3,"Beautiful, but delicate","I know--of course wine goblets are delicate! But, because of the etching in these, one false move and they are dust. However, they are lovely, you can catch the color and movement of the wine well, and I still consider them a good purchase. I had purchased them on a department store website because the store itself was out of them. Then, I found they were backordered. Why I didn't start at Amazon is beyond me. Of course, Amazon had them and got them here right on time. In one piece! (Or rather, four, since there are four glasses.)"
3,Be careful,"These wine glasses are larger (actually they are huge which is great for aerating the wine) than I expected. They are also VERY delicately thin! If you tap them together (very gently) it sounds like a church bell!But you have to be careful when washing them. Although I haven't broken one yet, I'm afraid if I'm not extra careful, one or two will break. I had a guest break oneof Mikasa's high ball glasses which are somewhat thicker. They do match these wine glasses which is cool."
3,"Beautiful, but too fragile","These Goblets are beautiful. They have a wonderful whimsy about them that adds life to the table. The problem is that they are too thin. They are eggshell thin. When you sip from them they feel like they may snap between your lips or possibly cut your lip. I will love them while they are here, but I am afraid that wont be very long. I have only had them a few months and I have already broken two of them."
4,So cute.,"My mom got these for me for Christmas. At first I thought they were just adorable! Since they were not ""matching"" but rather ""coordinating"" with 4 different etching patterns.Then I noticed how HUGE they are. You can fit basically an entire bottle of wine into the glass, filled to the brim. Less refills ;)Honestly though, they're completely fun and I've gotten a few compliments already from friends. The only thing I worry about is how thin they are, I am on pins and needles whenever I wash them."
4,Beautiful but so fragile!,"I received 2 sets of these glasses as a wedding gift. While they are absolutely beautiful, they are super fragile. You MUST handwash them, and be really careful when drying. The stem will snap very easily, and then your finger will be sliced open (I speak from experience). Overall, I love them, but be careful!"
1,every glass broken on arrival,"no longer tha 10 minutes after the package arrived UPS, we opened the package to find that every glass was shattered. very difficult to get hold of UPS for return. currently awaiting refund/ disposition."
3,a bit heavy,"I purchased this set because I liked the size and nice balloon shape of the glasses. Unfortunately, they were a bit heavy for my liking, so I ended up returning them."
4,Very large wine glasses!,"These are attractive, thin crystal but are very large - maybe a little too big even for my large woman's hands. But I knocked one over on my countertop and it didn't break! I will handwash them. *** Well, it's been almost a year that I've had these wineglasses, and I DO put them in the dishwasher, with no problem whatsoever. They're pretty nice even though I still think they're on the large size. Next time I would get smaller glasses."
4,wine glasses,"good size,very pretty,light,havent broke any yet,thinking about ordering another set or two,good value,received quickly,maybe xmas presents,i like that each one has a different pattern"
3,Delicately Beautiful,"I love the Mikasa Cheers glasses, wine glasses, martini glasses, pitcher and ice tea glasses. I have them all. I have used these glasses for 3 years and they do break very easily, the entire series, just be aware of that if you purchase. That been said I get compliments every time I use these glasses, company loves them! I am not going to replace them anymore as they perish, now I am looking for something a little less delicate."
2,Not meant for women's shoes,"These work well for a man's shoes, but heels go right through. We had to cut the box the heels came in and put the cardboard down under the shoes... looks like crap. That said, they're just regular shelves with tilted mounts, so buy the cheap shelves and put your shoes on those!"
3,Shoe racks,I purchased these racks to add to my Rubbermaid closet system which I love. However I'm a little disappointed with the shoe racks. As another reviewer commented the racks don't hold very many pairs of shoes. One rack only holds about three and a half pairs. I don't have huge feet or anything. The racks are well made. My order arrived on time and was packaged well.
3,Not overly impressed.,"I am a little disappointed with these shelves. I purchased these shoe shelves to add to already installed Rubbermaid Configurations closet system. For starters, the two shelves are different depths, and neither shelves have a snug fit with the provided hardware (brackets underneath). I realize the intent with the different depths. However, I find the rinky dink fit onto the brackets odd, since the Configurations closet system has a nice snug fit. If you are planning on mounting these two shelves side by side as mentioned on description, I would think twice.I am more than likely have to use something like zip ties to secure them to the brackets so the shelving will not shake or wobble. Having to use zip ties is a little ridiculous when one is paying almost $30 for two shelves (when I paid $60ish for the entire closet system). I wish I would have purchased the less expensive non-tilting two shelf system (on Amazon for $19). I feel a little cheated with this unit."
3,Don't hold much,"I liked the idea of having your shoes on a shelf, slanted so you can view them. However, the front lip of the shelf isn't deep enough and my husband's shoes barely stay on the shelf. They really don't hold much and if I did it again, I would skip these."
3,Beware - not a complete product,"I did not notice but this product does not come with the vertical extensions that get screwed to the wall so they have to be purchased separately for about $25 or so (unlike the shelves, they are not eligible for Amazon Prime). I bought them to function as a shoe rack in the gargage. In any event, the real price is closer to $50 when you add in the cost of the extensions. At that price, there are many competing alternatives."
4,Not Bad,"Very short. Not as interesting as the show I saw on the ovation channel, where he does songs from Easy Tiger with the Cardinals and a live audience. But if you're a fan it is enjoyable."
3,Picture quality,The DVD disk picture is very good except for the small white blocks at the very top of the screen that flash on/off. Very distracting. Was it a bad transfer to the DVD disks?
3,Stores are great. The Discs are not.,Not the best quaility discs that we are used to receiving from Amazon. No problem with the sale or delivery. I guess I just need to live with the bad spots on the discs.
4,good series good product,"Good writing and casting , always deilvers a more dry wit than belly busters ,certainly worth the money.I'll buy the rest of the series"
5,Funniest show on TV!!!,"A modern day curmudgeon. A doctor who hates everyone, everything, everywhere and all the time (but with class)! Funniest show since ""All in the Family""."
5,One Of The Funniest TV Shows,"This is one of the funniest and best played TV shows, especially with Reggie (actress Terry Farrell) and Bob (Saverio Guerra)in the show. It is also Ted Danson best acting in a movie or a TV show (better than in Cheers). It is a shame the show hasn't been on more TV stations and more often. I bought all the episodes of the show and I enjoy it watching it almost every day. The more I watch it the more I like it. The last episodes were less funnier because of the mediocre actor who replaced Bob in the show. All other episodes are great with all actors playing great. Linda (actress Shawnee Smith) and Margaret (Hattie Winston) are also better funnier than in any other shows or movies they have played."
5,netever,"Becker - a laugh out loud sitcom - he's rude, crude, and yet he has a big heart - and the supporting cast is funny - good writing and directing -This, in my opinion, is Ted Danson's best role.He exposes the crankie, cynic in us all."
5,Fantastic Thunderstorm,I love this CD. It's the best THUNDERSTORM recording I have heard. And the whole Cd is a real wonderful experience. I close my eyes and I can feel the rain on my face and hear the thunder rolling from all over... I am in the middle of the Thunderstorm. It's a great CD! Highly recommended for anyone who loves Nature Sounds and in particular Thunderstorms.
4,Strong thunder,I liked this CD and the rain very much. My only reservation is the Thunder is a little bit to strong if you are trying to actually sleep. It is great for relaxing. I bought this (and others) to desensitize my dog to thunderstorms and this is the one I won't leave on in the house w/ out me b/c of the sudden loud thunder. It does do it's job however:)
1,Hated it!,This CD sounded like water being poured onto a flat rock instead of the sound of raindrops. The rain sound was so irksome that I didn't even notice the thunder. A big waste of money.
1,I can't hear it!,I don't really know if I like it or not; I can't hear it. I have to turn the player up to 10 before I can hear anything.
1,disposable cell,"this is a disposable cell, this cell has a lifetime of 3 month, i got to buy another cell."
4,Wyman presents a new story of the US immigrant.,"I kept turning pages to see what happens next to our cousins that returned to their mother countries. The US was certainly not utopia for all that came here. Wyman stays tight and true to his subject, but the words flow so easily I read the book in one sitting."
2,The Flamingo That Did Not Fly South,"Okay I know I said I would put all my Joyce Dingwell books away, but this on had kids in it, and I'm a sucker for stories with kids in them.Especally old, old Harlequin Romances, but as usual Joyce Dingwell had me dizzy trying to understand the dialogue. Where the alpha M/F step on each others words, and the charactors speak in half formed sentences.So I will just say this went above and beyond that. Georgia even left the two young kids alone to go shopping, and have lunch with Agrippa, even after the boys had already taken a taxi to see the flamingos.From the back of the book: 'Georgia felt sorry for the two children in the care of the unfeeling Agrippa Smith. He was such and unreasonable man and obviously had no idea how to deal with two such highly-strung youngsters.So she agreed to stay in Cyprus and look after them and their pet flamingo. Perhaps she could reform Mr. Smith too?'"
3,Unconvincing Ripples,"Victor Davis Hanson's ""Carnage and Culture"" is destined to be a classic, an important work. ""Ripples of Battle"" fails to live up to this high standard. Although the stories of the three battles presented are interesting, their ""ripple effect"" as described by Hanson seems a little forced and unconvincing. His description of Okinawa comes off as a little self-serving (his uncle was killed in the battle), while Delium is presented as a turning point in history because Socrates participated in the battle and might have been killed. Socrates probably crossed the street every day too and might have been killed by an ox-cart at any time. But that doesn't make every day of his life turning point in history.In short, Hanson fails to convince the reader that his three battles have any more ripple effect than any other slice of everyday life. Interesting stories, well-written, but a slightly under-cooked premise."
5,"As always, Hanson educates, entertains, and provokes","I would like to clarify a mistake from two review previous. Lew Wallace, Union soldier from Indiana, wrote Ben-Hur, not a founding member of the KKK! How offensive...please be more careful."
4,Interesting.,"This one grew on me. Once you get past the budgetary concerns, you find a pretty good story here. I'm not one of those internet bashers who bash anything they can because they can. Rather, I appreciate what they did. If you enjoy movies in general, you'll enjoy this. There was quite a bit of humor. Check it out."
1,Not effective for snow removal,I thought the propane torch would be great (dare I say fun) for snow and ice removal. Doesnt work. It won't melt snow or ice in a sweeping motion as you walk along. The flame is too small and focused. It would take HOURS to clear snow from a sidewalk or driveway with the little burner.
3,torch on a stick,"Works well, but if you use it too close to the ground the flame blows out. Make sure you take a shower after you use this becauuse you end up smelling pretty bad after cooking some weeds. Not a good idea to use flip/flop shoes when you are using this torch, feet might get too hot."
3,works well but be careful,"This product will burn up weeds but did not do that much on heavy ice in the driveway, chemicals are still a better weapon on ice. This puts out a lot of heat so make sure you are wearing work shoes not sandals. The flame is not that visible in bright Sun so be careful of surrounding items near where you are working. Buy a spark igniter for easy lighting without getting too close to the blast of flame at ignition, a match or cigarette lighter is not a good idea. This is a flame thrower so use it wisely."
3,propane torch weedburner,"It works ok, but doesn't burn the weeds as fast as I thought it would andit uses a lot of propane."
5,"Concise writing with excellent, practical examples","Schilling has prepared a great book to be be used in any strategic management class. As a student using this book within a strategic management class at Southern Polytechnic State University, I enjoyed the short chapters that were introduced with practical real-word case studies. Her end-of-chapter summaries were also appreciated.Students at a technical university will enjoy the case studies relating to the PalmOne, Dell, Nokia, etc.Despite the fact that chapters were short in no way implies that her content was ineffective. On the contrary, her ability to concisely write the content was very much appreciated. No fluff; just the facts.I believe students will appreciate this approach and enjoy using a book of this nature in any strategic management class."
2,Limited!,"While the Kindle Book saves me the trouble of having to carry a text book, I find it highly annoying that I have a laptop and 2 tablets and this kindle book is limited to just one device at a time! It is not really practical for when I want to use my laptop to have to have my iPad 24/7 with me to view the book for studying! At times I just want to be able to view the Kindle book on my MacBook so that I can make annotations quicker and multi-task faster! However, getting that message license limit has been reached is annoying especially that I already bought this and do not wish to purchase another copy just to view on another device that I own especially when other books do this seamlessly! Very limiting!"
5,Easy Reading,Very easy to use and understand. Clear printing and large pages. Everyone who has looked at my copy has been impressed. It would be nice to have the map expanded a bit more to cover additional suburbs.
4,Good book on a standard subject,I thought this book was a very good book on elementary number theory. It covered all the standard topics for such a book. The author was clear in his presentation of topics.
2,Plenty of choices...,"Another thin book on a standard subject with horrendous price. Another cheap effort hope to reap in good cash. Look elsewhere, plenty of choices."
4,"Perfect product, but misrepresented","The VN900 is a wonderful product. It is the smallest of kind, easy to use, has powerful extra features like programmable alarms to help you remember when and what to do on a busy day. The battery consumption is nill, much lower than some competative products. It suits my purposes perfectly.but . . .It does NOT record 90 minutes of voice. In LP mode the sound quality is SOOO poor that it is USELESS. Ninety minutes of muffled incomprehensible noise is perfectly USELESS, a stupid choice on the part of Olympus. The medium and high quality modes are quite good, but you only get 33 and 22 minutes! Folks, this model should be called VN330, not VN900"
