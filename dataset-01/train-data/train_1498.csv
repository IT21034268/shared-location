4,Great book,Phil is a great Player. I love to watch him on the WPT. It was nice to just read a book from him and try to get into that poker brats mind
1,Don't pad Phil's bankroll.,"If you've got the credits that Phil Helmuth has, then you've every right to write a book. I just figured it should be good. Great player, horrible teacher. The one thing i learned from Phil is to be a total jerk at the table. Ask how many chips a player has, feint at huge bets by grabbing larger stacks of chips then betting less, and take your time. I learned all that from watching him on ESPN, and nothing from this book."
3,Phil Hellmuth loves himself as much as he loves poker.,"This is not a bad book for beginning poker players, but honestly, there's not much in it that you couldn't cull from a little online searching. The most useful part of this book dwells on pre-flop and flop betting; for the turn and the river, you're on your own. He's also much more detailed on betting in Limit hands than in No Limit hands, and wastes a number of pages just explaining low hand in Omaha H/L. I'd expect a book on playing poker like the pros to not really have to explain the very basic rules of said game. In any case, the gratuitious stories about his wins (and losses) could have been replaced by some straightforward information on betting through to the river and other tidbits you might have found useful in a book about, well, poker - but overall, it's a good place to start for the novice."
3,Good and Bad,"I was hesitant to read this book because it was not well received by several boards/newsgroups. I think it is a mistake not to read this book, partially because Phil Hellmuth can be a great player when his game is on. But more because I think there is some useful information in the book and the book is cheap compared to other poker books.Be prepared for self glorification from Phil and try to read past it for some useful, but not earth shattering, poker info."
4,Great book... would like a little more.,"World Champion poker player Phil Helmuth is a great author and this book ""Play Poker Like the Pros"" is very clearly written. I have read it about 3 times now... it is not boring by any means. Don't expect it to make you play like a pro though, you need a lot of practice and need to read more than this one book! Anyways, above all, i think it is a really good book and I recommend it... the only thing i would like to see is a little more... it doesn't go in depth very much."
4,A good Book for the Starter.,"First off, like many of you here it sure is funny to watch Phil lose. Now that being said I read the novice and intermediate chapters before I got in my first Live Tournament ($50 dollar buy-in, 49 players) and I Took 3rd place ($200). So I can say that this book paid for it self. I think its a good book with easy strategy to follow and I would recomend this book to the beginers, seeing thats me, a beginer. thanks Phil for giving me $200 return on my $15 investment."
1,Awful. Worthless guide to NL Hold'em,This is useful for limit poker but worthless as a guide to NL games. He spends less than 30 pages on NL and more than 150 on limit -- a hugely disproportionate volume of information. This is a primer for beginners only. Do not waste your money.
4,its a good book,"Phil's book was the first poker book I had purchased when I began playing poker at a more competitive level. Prior to reading this book, I had failed at the lowest levels of poker in both limit and no limit play. I studied his book and my winnings increased almost 300% within a few weeks. His general principals and guidlines are just that and need to be implemented in your own style of play. This book is not meant to be the sole guide to your game, however is defineately very useful and easy to read for the beginning player. Phil is a world class poker player and has had much success in his life at the table. We don't have to like him, but I don't have to like people to be able to learn from them either. His style is much like mine and I wouldn't be at the level I am at had I not purchased his book. I've certainly added to my collection as my game has improved but this is the perfect book for beginning players."
3,OK but Sketchy,"Aside from his constant bragging, Mr. Phil's authorial ""voice"" is pleasant and he conveys information fairly well. He often gives the player a choice of strategic approaches to a situation and that is honest because there are various approaches that will work. His top-ten-only strategy is labeled as a beginner's strategy and will help the beginner stay alive while he learns.The biggest problem I have with the book is that it covers too much ground too shallowly. It would have been much better had he stuck to, say, no-limit Holdem tournaments. Also, his player types are too sketchy. There isn't enough detail.There are one or two situations where I have the temerity to flat disagree with his analysis but I could well be wrong on those.I would have given this book fewer stars, maybe one whole star fewer, because there is better information in so many poker books but Phil writes surprisingly well and has a sense of humor about himself that makes the boasting much less of a problem."
2,You can do better,"There are a few good points in this book, but the writing style is absolutely horrific (did they even use an editor?), and I just can't believe that many of these pointers would ever work in low- to mid-limit hold-em games. Nevertheless, some reviewers here have said that they've used these techniques with success, so more power to them. If you already have a number of poker books (Sklansky, Brunson, Cloutier, etc.), and already have a solid knowledge of poker, then you might want to borrow - NOT BUY - this book for some light reading. On the other hand, if this is the only book you ever read, then you're welcome to play with me any time."
2,Nothing New Here,"I have read a bunch of poker books and play regularly. There are a lot of good books out there, Dan Harrington's the very best, but this isnt one of them. Too much ego here and not enough helpful information."
1,Somehow I knew it would be useless,"I suppose this is a good book for someone who is just learning how to play poker. I didn't have much faith in the book when I purchased it. It's cheaper than alot of poker books, so I figured Hellmuth would at least share a couple of good nuggets of information. If you have never played poker and want to learn the rules of the game, and starting hand strengths, you will benefit from this book. If you're a thinking player looking for insights from others, look somewhere else."
2,"maybe read this as a first book, but probably not at all","I don't find anything of unique value in this book. It has some decent material, but nothing you can't find in greater detail elsewhere. Phil does not even cover pot odds here, but seems to find plenty of time to tell us all about his famous tournament moments. As a beginner, I found Lee Jone's Winning Low-Limit Texas Holdem much more helpful."
4,"good, does not deserve the negative reviews","It's just a good book for beginners and if you stick to what is said in the books you do well online. It's informative, nicely written and fun to read. Don't really get the negative reviews."
2,Not a great book,"This book would be fine for a beginner poker player that wants some insight into how a legend of the game thinks. It does not teach you how to play poker like the pros. It also is poorly written so it isn't a ""fun"" read."
2,World's Greatest Player: Just Ask Him,"While there is seldom an ego shortage among the great no limit players, this is one TV star who must have an unlimited budget for mirrors. Soaring like an eagle, says Phil, is the way you want to picture yourself at the poker table. Super image as long as you are playing no limit hold'em, you've got some people at the table who don't know you for the windbag bluffer that you are, and you have cards landing that help the hopeless rags you tend to start with. The book is short on common sense, long on philosophical nonsense and way too lean on anecdotes. Write a book about bluffing for a million dollars without soiling yourself, Phil. That one I'll buy."
4,a mixture of hellmuth's personal expierence/advice on poker,"This book is not a ""how-to"" in any sense of the word. Its not a book like ""winning low-limit holdem'"" or ""Holdem' for the advanced player"". Phil gives a certain approach (His own personal approach, for the most part) and gives sound advice on playing the hand from there. He explains tells, slowplaying, and even bluffing in a basic way that any level of poker player can understand. He even has a section on No Limit Poker, which I personally liked the best. He tells the reader about some hands that he played himself to either victory or defeat. You basically cannot go wrong if you buy this book, it's both informative and entertaining."
4,This Book Will Improve Your Game,"Poker pro, Phil Hellmuth is a bit of a crybaby on the poker circuit, but he's without question one of the world's greatest players. Hellmuth shares his poker wisdom on Hold 'Em and other poker games in this book, which is well worth the investment for any serious player.I only read the portion of the book which dealt with Hold 'Em, but I was very impressed by what I read. It sounds so easy, yet it's an extremely disciplined approach to the game which most players find impossible to consistantly maintain. Hellmuth relates not ony which hands to play, but how to play them, depending on what type of players you find yourself up against.If you are a beginning poker player, or even intermediate, you must read this book, which will be paid for by the first pot it enables you to rake."
3,Not a Bad Beginner's Book. The Author's a Wind Bag.,"Phil Helmuth is as annoying in his writing as he is around a poker table. The book is part infomercial for various preferred casinos and web sites, part instructional manual for novice to intermediate players, but mostly a vehicle for Phil's ego. Hardly a page goes by without Phil reminding us what a great poker player he is. A psychologist could have a field day w/ his overinflated ego. As far as the content on poker play goes, it's better than most books for novices on the subject."
2,not good,"The first time I ordered it I had pressed audible books so I thought the entire page was audible,but found out when I got the book it was a regular book. My bad but not happy. Then I went back and ordered it through you I believe and had to go through audible.com to purchase it. When I did I selected that I wanted to download it to CD. But after the purchase as far as I could tell it never gave me that option and only let me download using itunes. Oh Well. As far as the product itself . I think it is really good. I had heard it previously through my local library."
3,Get the facts straight,"First off, learn your facts before reviewing this book, Mark. Phil boy hasn't won the World Series of Poker 9 times! Hey, he's an excellent player, but to give him that kind of credit is a joke. His book is okay for any beginner, but Doyle Brunson or Sklansky go more into detail. If you are already familiar with the game and play it even occasionally, this is not the book for you. You'd be better off buying Doyle, Sklansky, or even Ken Warren. They all have better books than this. If your an absolute beginner like Mark, this isnt a bad buy."
3,good book,it is a good book I wish it delt with texas holdem a little more then it does but it is still very helpfull.
5,Works for me!,"The other reviewers need to get a grip. Phil Hellmuth IS great and ""it ain't braggin' if it's true"". I am making money using advice primarily from this book, Brunson's book, and Mike Caro's Book of tells. If you are a beginner, buy all three."
2,Way to go Phil... You blew it.,"This book has very little quality content. There isn't much revealed here that isn't found in virtually every other poker book out there. If you have read any poker books at all, don't bother. In fact even if you haven't read any poker books, don't bother. There are far better books out there.I read the Holdem' section and was left with a feeling that I had been robbed.Look at Phil Gordon's books and pair them up with Doyle Brunson's Super System if you are serious. Phil Gordon provides a solid playing style while Doyle's books provide the details behind the decisions."
1,Phil is Great,"Yes he's great. He wins alot and is possibly one of the best Hold'em players of all time. I dont know if he did it on purpose but he basically tells you just enough that you understand he can do it but he doesnt offer any help on 'how' to do it. I think maybe he doesnt want to actually help anyone get better at poker. He just wants to advertise he's awesome.He says things like ""then you have to figure out how to win the most money"" after building up a whole story of a hand that you are going to win.Sklansky and Harrington books tell you HOW to get the most money into the pot when you are going to win."
1,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to this book and have to say I have been rather disapointed with it. There is little that is new, interesting of even accurate in this book. The player types are well known to all experienced players, just named after animals in this case. He does introduce a new type, the ""eagle"" or expert, which did intrigue me but says ""Learning to play like an eagle ... is beyond the scope of this book"" (Page 35). Thanks a lot.The chapter on online play is mostly devoted to promoting his website and that of his sponsor, UltimateBet.com. The reason he likes ""UB"" so much, besides the fact they pay him big bucks? ""UB's game is the only one that will let me concentrate."" What the heck does that mean, really slow software perhaps?The only good thing about this book is that I might get to play against players following his maniacal advice. See you online."
1,bad for beginners,"This is a book that is very, very dangerous for beginners at texas holdem. (If you are beginner, the book is a 1 star book)Hellmuth tells you to play only a few, very good hands preflop. That is good.Then he tells you to play them all the same: VERY AGGRESSIVE. And this is not a good advice if you are playing low-limit holdem.To use his own language: there are to many elephants (callingstations) at lowlimit.A lot of players will stay even if you play aggressively preflop and on flop. If you are sitting with 77, 88, 99 (hands that Hellmuth tells you to raise and reraise) or something like that, you will lose a lot when you dont hit a set.This aggressive strategy only works if the other players fold, and in low limit they dont.This book explains Hellmuths style, and that style is not something to use against elephants. If you want to learn how to play, buy for example Lee Jones: ""Winning Low Limit holdem""."
1,I know poker. This book will hurt your game.,"I've been playing professional poker for 24 years. This book is close to the worst poker book I have ever read. Buying this wont help your win rate at all, furthermore, readings this book will MAKE YOU LOSE MONEY.By something by 2+2, or Hilger's book, or a Ciaffone instructional.Joe Bellz"
3,Okay book for intermediate+ players,"This is a very good book if you want to learn how to play all of the different sorts of poker games; however, the book offers little advice that is not in many of the better poker books.I grabbed the book quickly while in an airport, so this is probably more my fault, but seeing Hellmuth's name, I thought that the book would offer a lot more - - it didn't. I am not sure if it's because Hellmuth is a new age poker player or if it's because it has so many different game focuses, but I did not come away with a ""must have"" book feeling.If you are a beginner or want to know the rules for the games, this would be a recommended book."
4,good book for basic play,I've made money since reading this book. The basic stradagy is easy to follow and the intermediate is good when you get the basics down. Since buying this book I have only left the tables down one time! A must for new hold-em players. Thanks Phil!
1,Cat hates it,"My cat won't even take a bite of this stuff,if I put this in his dish he proceeds to scratch all around it trying to bury it and giving me dirty looks all through his vigorous scratching.To me the food smells like a big bowl of oatmeal, so I can't blame him if he won't try it.For me it was a waste of money."
4,Excitement and romance!,"All roled into one novel. Beverly Jenkins has proven to be a wonderful historical romance writer. This book has plenty of action, mystery and romance. You don't know what to expect next and that's a good thing. If you read Beverly Jenkins books you'll notice that most of them have a link to another. It makes you want to go back and read the book before this one. I want to know the history of Cyclops (Galen) and his family now. The ending was not a disappointment in this book. In fact it ended beautiful. I recommend this book to all romance and mystery fans. It's a wonderful read."
5,Beverly hits another one out of the park.,I love Beverly Jenkins' books and this one is no exception. The characters are so fun to be with. The mystery of the Eye and the handsome knight who saves the damsal and the damsal saves him right back is reminiscent of Beverly's frontier novels. I loved this story! If you like being on pins and needles you'll like it too.
5,Great reading.,"Excellent read, enjoyed every word, couldn't put it down. Will be reading more of Beverly Jenkins. Will recommend this novel to my friends."
2,Buy if you HAVE to.,"All in all, this book was just plain good. I was disappointed with it though. The prices were very inaccurate for the time. I urge you to look at other books."
2,quality of pictures poor,"Frankly, I was disappointed in this book. It has some good information, but the quality of the pictures is very poor. Many of them are out of focus or too far away and look very amateurish. Also, the prices for the Beanies seem out of date. I wish I could get Righty for $110.00."
3,"Good Information, but...","The books is a must for the beginning bean bag collector. Who knew there were so many different versions of the little bean filled critters?! For anyone curious about what's out there, and what to look for, this book is great. It could have done without the price guides, though. Since it's so hard to keep price guides current, it could confuse the begining collector. Keep in mind, these ""going prices"" Brecka refers to are the ""going prices"" when she wrote the book, not what they are now. She ought to have left the prices guides for the monthly magazines. Another thing, there is almost TOO much detailed information about the Ty Beanie Babies. Though they may be the hottest items in the book now, do they really deserve sixty-five pages when the other brands only get one or two at the most? Pictures and names would have probably been enough. Still, I think these book is worth a read."
4,A stellar product for a modern home theater,I just received this product and in 15 minutes had it hooked up and was watching video through my home theater (my components are listed below). I was very impressed with menuing system. It's good looking and very simple to navigate. The remote is small but functional and attractive. The video (which is upscaled to 1080p because of my gear) looks about as good as standard definition DVD (which amazed me because I was expecting a lot grainer images). The audio through my Onkyo and Definitives was crystal clear. I highly recommend this product.
3,"Sluggish, but enjoyable","PROS:- On-screen iPod menu controls (DLO proprietary interface, not a clone of what's on your iPod menus)- Displays song and album art of what's playing (though not full-screen)- Plays video and music through your home theater system.- Continues to charge your iPod when dock is put on Standby.- Remote control (also simple to find a replacement on DLO's website, if say, someone dropped it onto a hardwood floor and broke it)CONS:- Remote control range is somewhat limited.- The dock's response time is slower than desired. There's noticeable lag between the time you hit a button on the remote and the time it's reflected on screen.EXTRA TWO CENTS:I'm not sure why it's so complicated to design a dock such as this one. There has to be a big market for iPod docks that connect to home theater systems and feature onscreen controls and displays.This dock was one of the few out there that would charge my iPod, display menu navigation onscreen, and play through my home theater system."
4,good poduct easy to use,this product works very well and is easy to use. I am happy that I bought it
3,A little disappointed,"The HomeDock Deluxe plays the music from my Ipod through my TV fine. However, the Album Artwork feature that I was looking forward to did not appear. The people at DLO informed me that the software in the new Classic 160 Ipod does not allow the Artwork to appear on the TV screen.I have not yet mastered the remote control."
3,`Your killer is a man no-one suspects ..',"Chicago in 1893, during the great Exposition, has the eyes of the world on it and a bloodthirsty killer loose within it.Inspector Alastair Ransom is burdened by his own past and haunted by his own demons. Still, he is determined to solve these crimes and becomes even more determined when he realizes that the killer is moving closer to him and those he cares about.While this novel is uneven in parts, it blends some interesting characters with grittily depicted action. Ransom himself combines the strengths, flaws and angst of some of the best and most interesting detectives. I worked out who the killer was sometime before the end of the novel but by then the tension was well established and the question was when the killer would be caught.This is the first book to feature Alistair Ransom, and I'll be seeking out the sequels as opportunity permits. A good rainy day read.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
1,Dreadful writing a translation from some alien tongue?,"I typically enjoy historical mysteries, but the writing in this book was so horribly awful that I was unable to finish it, even though it was the only un-read book in the house (imagine you're hungry and bite into your last commestible only to find it is a brussels sprout and you get the idea). You remember in Men In Black, how the ship-wrecked alien ""slipped into"" the farmer's body and animated it in an almost totally unconvincing manner? That's what the writing in this book is like. A dry recitation of facts about the period would have been more appealing than this attempt to ""bring them to life"" with the help of completely unsympathetic characters and a dreadfully stilted prose that isn't modern, isn't period, is just awful. Even the wording of the dedication makes one wince. The only use I can see for this book is to serve as a text in a ""how not to write"" class."
1,Distracted by the dialog,"Shadows in the White City: An Inspector Alastair Ransom Mystery (Inspector Alastair Ransom Mysteries)I was so distracted by the anachronistic dialog and ridiculous characters that I couldn't really appreciate the storyline. I love historical mysteries, and like to follow up on a series, but I can't go on with this one."
1,Boring and Horrible Read,"With this book, it was almost thrown out 2 times while trying to read it. So slow, so much ""talking"" where the author I think is trying to impress the readers with old 1800's talk; didn't work for me.I would say 95% of the book is about the author rambling on, 1% about how the killer kills and 3% about Chicago history.It gave me headaches at time trying to read this thing, I do not suggest it to anyone.I would have liked to have more thrill, suspense, this book did not offer it.I really think the author just likes to hear himself ramble on with meaningless words."
2,Truly Milde,"In the spirit of Schenkar's grasping at straws to add pages to her book, I'd like to provide a recipe of my own:How to Bore and Infuriate a ReaderTake 1 very interesting characterAdd vast amounts of filler and repetitionLard with half-baked postmodern theoryHeap in generous amounts of self-satisfactionInfer that you've egregiously taken advantage of Nathalie Barney's elderly and generous housekeeperStir it all up with bad prose.Half-bake and serve forth to an unsuspecting audience."
1,Truly Wilde,This book is truly dreadful. What is unsettling is that close to 400 pages of repetitious drivel is wasted on what at most would have a been a mildly interesting magazine article.
1,Fantasy,This book was the fantasy of the author with most of the information completely unrelated to Dolly Wilde. I cannot even think of one redeeming word to say about it. It was an agonizing read.
2,Don't Bet Against Determined Squirrels,"Initially seemed to work well, squirrels slid off unto the ground, but before too long, they figured it out. Device could possibly be a little wider for a better effect. The key is having a more resistant bird feeder."
2,Bad Kindle Edition,"My rating and review reflect the Kindle edition, not Euripides' plays, nor the translations and commentaries of these works. THE TROJAN WOMEN AND OTHER PLAYS is a horrible Kindle edition. The text of the plays does not act as text, but like a picture. The reader cannot change the text size (which is small), nor does the dictionary function work. Nor are there links to the notes. The reader must put in the location number of the notes in order to go there. (It would be much more helpful if for these Kindle editions editors would do footnotes instead of endnotes.) I read the sample before I bought the edition, but it was deceiving since it only covered the Introduction, which behaves like normal Kindle text. Were this one of the relatively inexpensive editions, I would not be bothered by the poor Kindle features. But since this book was almost at full Kindle price, I expected much, much better."
4,Very Brave,"Being that Vodou is a verbal Religion,compared to Islam or Christianity Maya Deren did a fantastic job! She explains and understands the religion more than many practioners I know.The video is also fantastic! I applaud her tremendously! What major leap.Many writer in Vodou now stumble when they try to attempt what Deren has over 50 years ago."
4,"What ""Divine Horsemen"" really signifies","You can take or leave the rich details on the deities of Voudoun; those who condescend to African-based religions may cease to do so after reading these chapters. But writing as one who has studied Haitian and African drumming, I am reminded by the final dramatic chapter (on possession) of a Dickinson poem which contains the lines ""And through a Riddle, at the last --Sagacity, must go --"". Nothing can prepare you for this."
5,Great Product,"After the usual wash and clay bar usage i can sit a bottl on my hood and it wont slide off.. after using the hd cleanes even on the slightest incline the paint is so silky smooth that it will slide right off.. this product is great but, with its dark brown color it can stain some scratches in lighter color cars ( i have a pearl white one) it isnt a bad stain but it is noticeable and hard to get out if not careful.. also consider the applicator that you use with this product for this product only as there is no washing out the dark brown stains... after using this applying the zymol wax is a breeze.. it buffs out much easier and the shine is nice"
4,A Great Harmony band,"Most of us have heard The Association's most famous tunes maybe literally a thousand times, usually blasting out of a mono AM car or home radio in the old days. It's a real treat to hear these hits (and some that should have been) on this fine sounding remaster. These guys are one of the finest vocal bands to ever enter a studio (the playing is great too, actually). It features ""Cherish,"" probably the best / most-played unrequited love song ever not sung by a saloon singer!Enjoy this great CD from this somewhat underrated band."
4,You won't be disappointed,I loved the mystery / historical romance as the heroine goes back in time to see her relatives fall in love with their men. Beautifully executed with a surprise ending.
5,Best concert DVD ever!,"I am a fan of the group since they came out and when I found out they had a DVD coming out I didn't think twice, so I got it. It was the best decision I have ever made! The quality of the DVD is great, it arrived on time, and you are going to be amazed with their voices! Get this DVD it's great!"
5,ILVOLO TAKES FLIGHT,ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL! NOT ONLY ARE THEIR VOICES OUTSTANDING BUT THE PERFORMANCE IS CAPTIVATING.I BOUGHT THIS AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND AND I'M SURPRISED IT HAS NOT BEEN WORN OUT. SHE WATCHED AND ENJOYED IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BEING ITALIAN ONLY ENHANCES THE PLEASURE OF THEIR TALENTS!!!
5,"Romantic Songs with Italian passion, charm and good-looks!","Though we LOVE Il Volo's music, our live concert experience in Chicago was disappointing--too crowded, couldn't see, stage and theater dark and distracting. So we were THRILLED to see Il Volo SHINE on this DVD! The camera closeups and lighting bring them right to us! The orchestra is great. Their Italian good-looks WOW. Love the added SOLOS for each beautiful voice, and their charming commentaries. The live audience enthusiasm and applause make it all the more exciting! We're planning an Italian Night Dinner Party and showing of the Concert!P.S. After we received our DVD, we wanted to order more for gifts, but there was a ""hold for review of product"" from Amazon. Thankfully now the hold is lifted."
2,Il Volo Takes Flight from the Detroit Opera House,"Wow, what a disappointment.My wife and I enjoyed the video on PBS so much that we ordered the DVD for our own enjoyment. We reviewed it last night for the first time. First we tried our Blu Ray DVD player and the concert looked like the fog settled in or the place was a smoke filled room... So, we tried our older DVD player and the color was much improved but no where near as good a picture as on our recorded PBS program on our DVR. Not sure what the problem is. Maybe we have a bad DVD. I would return it if this was an option, but not sure how to handle this. Has anyone else had this problem??? W.J.Young"
5,The volo singers,"I love them ,they are all very good looking ,I love those young men,they are wonderfull singers, and have beautifull voices. I can not get enough of them .I bought a dvd and I watch it every night.I love it that much. Thank you so much."
5,enjoyong my ElVolo,"I enjoy the pure natural gift of God that come out of these young men voices. They blend of their voices is so enjoy to listen to. They interact with each other, see the different personality. I have been hooked since American Idol."
5,brilliant,"These young men are wonderful with voices far beyond their years. very enjoyable. If you enjoyed the three tenors, than you would love this one."
5,Fantastic music,"This DVD is sure to please. Amazing talent! My one regret is that the Spanish song they did with Pia Toscano was not on here, but all the others are fabulous!"
5,An unexpected joy!,"I came home one night from a dinner date, and turned on the TV. A local PBS station which was set earlier came on, and I heard these incredible, mature voices coming out of these baby-faced singers. I was mesmerized and sat listening without moving a muscle until the program ended for a fund-raising break. Until this, I had never heard of Il Volo. After the program, I ordered two albums, one for myself and one for a friend who I knew would enjoy and appreciate these incredible singers.Recommend this album? Absolutely!"
5,IL Volo...takes flight DVD,"These three charming Italian teens, Piero 18/Ignazio 17/Gianluca 16, sing pop/operatic selections like angels. Love them and their music! Their harmonies are superb, and if one wasn't watching, one would think these were two grown men tenors and one baritone. The documentary about them included on the DVD is wonderful and not to be missed."
5,Blown away!,"This is an incredible find for me. And quite frankly I stumbled on to it ona pledge drive for public TV. I was transported (quite a technical term )On their Voices and stage presence, then I find out how young they are.I love some classical music,not very many operas and I supposeI loved the music of Il Volo takes Flight because it had familiar Melodies.But never-the less the range and power of their voices is incredible.and the standing ovations attest to the fact they are well loved.A lost soul now as I am In love with Italy forever.I purchased the concert DVD because even though their music is tremendous,the Theater, the interaction and the cheers of the audience to me add aWonderful element.(also shows whose voice is whose)."
5,Live From Detroit Opera House,"What a trio and what a future these young men will have with their presense, voices, and joyfulness. It is a real pleasure to hear them and even more do to see them on the stage"
5,"Always love IL VOLO, but to be able to see them, well, that is icing on the cake. They are so personable and talented.","This is my most favorite of all because I can see them ""in person"", and I never get enough of them!!"
5,Volo takes flight,I rated II Volo a five because it was worth every penny to see my mom's face light up when I put it on for her. She saw them on PBS a few mths ago and has wanted a CD ever since. I bought it from Amazon knowing I would get it in time for a Christmas gift and I did. My mom is 87 and seems 40 years younger when she listens to II Volo.I would recommend this CD to young and old. Their talent is far beyound their years. I only wished I could of see them when they opened for Barbara S this last Nov. but I had an acciedent and could go.
5,For all ages,"Looking forward to Il Volo show in Cleveland in August. Besides ""Smile"" another favorite of mine is ""Hasta el Final"". I gave Il Volo albums as gifts to ten people at Christmas, and all are now fans. A friend/fan sent me the clipping of The New York Times article and it is now in a poster frame in my office. I am looking for the site from which to purchase photos, poster and other Il Volo articles. I am hooked, and so are my friends."
5,Il Volo takes flight - Live from the Detroit Opera House,These three young men have wonderful voices. So enjoyable to listen to and entertaining to watch the dvd. Great music!
5,Beautiful,"Loved it, even my husband was amazed at how talented and down to earth theses boys are! The interaction with the public is priceless."
5,perfect first baby for your baby,"I purchased this doll for my granddaughter's first birthday. She fell in love with it right away. She digs through her toy box for it, taking it for a ride in a basket, buggy or whatever is available. Today, she fell asleep cuddling it at nap time. It is an adorable doll; very soft, and the perfect size. Wonderful first doll!"
2,Weird,"I purchased this and a HABA Nelly doll for my 13 month figuring I would let my daughter decide which one she wanted (if any). She has no interest in the Madame Alexander doll at all. She carries her Nelly doll every where. She can't explain why, but the difference I notice is the hug factor. The Madame Alexander doll has a huge plastic face which is kind of freaky looking and her body is a very soft pillow. It's just weird how the face is so hard and the body is so soft. This doll, Nelly, and a few others are in her crib to allow her to pick the one she wants. We'll see if she ever turns to Madame Alexander. I'm sure that this will wind up at Good Will. Nelly is great. She's great to hug and very easy to carry around since she is material. Nelly has clothes that you can change and fun hair. Check her out if you looking for a non plastic first doll. HABA makes great products."
5,NOT GONNA RUIN THE REP,This is a great cd. I enjoyed it. The only complant i have is it is mostly snoop and dre. Not that much pac. And pac's all eyez on me had so many great songs. But besides that it is a great cd
5,bow down,"respect your dr.dre, this cd has some of the best songs ever from the mind of da doc himself and the dogg father, one eight seven is the song and murder was the case?, dude ya'll better recognize!!, i just wish the masters was creating new music so these ""lean wit it"" fools can shut the hell up!!"
2,An Atomic Dud,"Greatly disappointed by this purchase, and certainly would never call this a documentary. Instead, it is a collection of footage with no timeline, context, nor reason. The producer seems content to move from test to test, providing absolutely no understanding of the public, US political, or international forces leading to these amazing tests; there is no attempt to understand how these tests shaped any US or international policies. Instead, it appears the US atomic testing program was conducted by a bunch of curious, ""Gee, let's try this, Verne"" nuclear hackers with no accountability to anyone but themselves.Sorry - maybe I've been spoiled by BBC and PBS quality documentaries. But ""Atomic Journeys"" is no journey at all. More like a childish merry-go-round."
3,Some yesterday docos,"Just a set of docos about a very dawn of a nuclear weaponry, it is interesting for depicting the areas nuke tests had initially been conducted at.Perhaps, DVD extras are even more educative than 53 min run of a movie itself but the Soviet exercising in deploying the blasts for the water channel erecting is hardly understandable in a context of this work.Nothing of Chinese, Israeli and Indo-Pakistani endeavours might hardy be explained with secrecy surrounding these programs until realise of this documentary in 2006.Not speaking of North Korean, Iraqi and Iranian developments in a nuclear field till 2006."
4,Cats Lives On,"A well-done 'staged' production of the musical. I really like the cast in this version, I've seen Cats live with a different cast and I actually prefer the DVD :)The sound quality is great, but I don't believe the video is DVD-quality. It appears to be a transfer from some less-than-DVD-quality source. There is definitely some graininess, but still it's not BAD looking by any means - just not what you may expect from a DVD. And it's the highest quality version available so what can you do? It would be cool to see a higher-def version though."
3,CATS the Movie,"The players did a good job, but it would have been better had it been filmed before a live audience. I would have loved to see the CATS running through the audience as they did in the live productions."
3,Okay....,"Make-up and costumes are great. Lots of dancing, some of it not so great for kids. If I never hear ""Memories"" again it will be much too soon. The T.S. Eliot book is better."
1,packaging and the product quality was poor,"I bought this disc for my kids who got into T.S. Eliot lately. I was glad to see Elaine Paige's name in it too.DVD just arrived... the package of this disc is very poor, worse than any street vendor's pirate copy quality disc. There is nothing other than a disc in the plastic case. Disc top is printed so badly to make it look scratched.I rarely write review on products I buy online but this product made me to do that and check amazon.com to see if this was illegal copy or something.Very disappointed."
3,Too long!,The whole thing could have been boiled down to less than an hour! Boring watching the cat-people prance and dance after awhile.I had to turn on captions so I could understand any of the songs.
5,"Cats, Cats Wonderful Cats","Cats is a very wonderful show for me. I started to watch it when Isaw it on wedu. I loved it since then and it is the only show I watch in my spare time. One of my favorate Cats is is, well I like all of them. I love Old Dutaronamy beacuse he is the leader of all of the cats. I like Mistfolees beacuse at the end of the show he does that little magical and brings bach Old Dutaronamy plus he is cute. I like Rum Tum Tugger beacuse He is cute, he has all of the right moves to atract girls. Now VICTORIA, man she is so flexable, she can bring foot all the way up to her head. I can just go on for hours But I can't. Just to tell all you people oyt there,if I can do almoast all of the moves, you can to and learn all the words. I recomend this to for any age. No matteR how old you are you will love it."
4,enchanting,"excellent version of the andrew lloyd weber classic cats, may she rest in peace on broadway. it has to be happiest cutest musical ever made. great for the little ones if you want to get them started on musicals. ellan paige reprise her roll as grizebella and does a wonderful job. all the charaters come alive with the light and airy lyrics. somber at points but overall a happy ending great musical."
5,CATS THE COMMERATIVE EDITION,"I MUST TELL YOU THAT IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME BEFORE GOING TO SEE THE BRAOADWAY PLAY,I MUST ADMIT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TOOK ME SO LONG,I ENJOYED CATS SO MUCH THAT I WAS AT THE LAST PUBLIC SHOWING ON B'WAY,WHAT A THRILL.WHEN I NOTICED THE VIDEO ON AMAZOM""S SITE,I HAD TO HAVE IT,I COULD'NT WAIT UNTIL THE VIDEO ARRIVED,I,RIPED OPEN THE BOX ,POPPED THE VIDEO INTO MY VCR AND I WAS RELIVING THE FEELING OF BEING IN THE AUDIENCE AT THE WINTER GARDEN THEATER IN NEW YORK,THE VIDEO WILL BE WATCHED BY MANY&THE,THIS VERSION WAS GREAT & I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT,AND AS I WOULD SAY""THE MEMORIES WILL LIVE FOREVER."
4,"Two thumbs, rather, four paws, up!","This video is the closest thing to seeing the musical in the theater! I was able to see the finer details in the lavish costuming and beautiful makeup- this video really does the musical justice. And unlike being at the theater, there were no distractions, I didn't have to see the play around the person in front of me, and I could take the intermission whenever I wanted. I dare say that my cats even enjoyed watching the video, batting the screen with their paws!"
2,"Cat fanatics, this one's for you.","Has it's moments but can hardly be called ""great"" musical theater as the score (with the exception of one song) is fairly lackluster. I just don't see the excitement, but I guess that's because I'm a dog person. Cat people will obviously love it though."
2,One great song + one great performance = 2 stars.,"Not much more to add to my better half's review, but it will probably keep the kids entertained. And if you're a cat fancier, then this is the show for you. Other than that: pffffffftttttttt!"
5,Learned so much more of the story,I loved the Video but did miss the audience participation. The music is great but missed so many of the lines in the on stage production and with the Video I got the story much better.
2,Great show; DVD is poor quality,"We were disappointed in the quality of this DVD. It skips randomly while in play. The DVD player built into the Macbook Pro displays a message that there is ""corrupt material"" during play, and the next time we play it, this happens at a different random spot. I've tried it in another DVD player and get the same results without the message--just skipping. I should have sent it back."
2,Delivery problems,"Paid extra for next day delivery,was not informed that signature was required. Missed UPS by 10 minutes(they would not leave with neighbor). After several calls, delivery rearranged 2 days later and almost missed it then."
5,amazing,Hi. I saw cats last year and i think that is a beautifull musical.I saw it in Broadway.It's wonderfull.I liked so much.
1,A piece of musical lint,"I wouldn't have thought it was possible: Take what may be the worst successful show in the history of musical theatre, and make a DVD of it THAT'S EVEN MORE HORRIBLE!!! Every scene is the same, leaving only Andrew Lloyd Webber's derivative, pretentious score (and the wonderful costumes, of course, but they can't carry an entire show). The producers of this DVD could have saved lots of time and money by simply filming the opening scene, then posting the message: ""Since every scene in this show is exactly like what you've just watched, this concludes the Commemorative Edition of 'Cats.' Thank you for your purchase."""
1,The 2nd worst thing that ever happend in New York,"This play sucks. It is pointless. The whole play is just about freaks running around in costumes trying to convince little kids that they're being cats. I hate it. But I must admit on the original B'way cd, I very muched like ""Tug Tugger"" or whatever it was called. This video was dreadfull. At times, they were just kicking their legs and just starring at each other and suff.I aggree with that kid who said it ruined his life. It didn't exactly ruin mine, but it was a close call. It is a little scarry for little kids. That is why ""Tiger's lat stand"" was cut out. I was freaked out and almost Crying when they were sining that. And I am 14 years old!Someday, I will be the king of broadway, and I will take this trash and make it into a good, classic hit. I have no idea why it lasted for such a freakin' long time."
1,The original one-song show rates one smelly furball!,"If you're a kid under six or the eccentric owner of more than, say, 10 or 12 house cats, give this dog five stars. If you are a somewhat discerning, semi-intelligent adult, own zero to one cats, and have a modicum of good taste, two dry furballs is very, very generous. To be fair, however, when ""Memory"" is sung, there aren't enough stars in the sky for this truly brilliant performance of a beautiful classic show song. But when the song ends, it all comes crashing back down to a mediocre, grossly over-rated one-song dud worth a single very wet and smelly furball. Your kids deserve better -- go for Cathy Rigby in ""Peter Pan,"" ""The Lion King,"" ""Beauty and the Beast,"" or ""Annie"" on CD instead. At least it'll give their imaginations a workout and they won't have to look at a lot of poor, struggling actors embarrass themselves in those ridiculous costumes."
1,cat-astrophic,"Unwatchable. Dreadful. Boring beyond belief. Maybe on stage it was fine, but as a video ""movie,"" it is horrifyingly stupid. Hyper-kinetic editing stuffed with closeups that make one aware of actors made up cutesy to look like cats who act like humans when they appear in musicals. The concept is nuts. Eliot's poems are inflated and robbed of all charm. Do not waste your money. The Cats phenomenon, whatever it once meant, is now a thing a thing of the past. Maybe Eliot will get his book back."
1,This play is truly horrible.,"What started out as something cute: the cute cat costumes with the clever cat-themed rhymes in the songs winds up being way overdone--2 full hours of this?! Please, only a psychotically-disturbed obsessed-compulsive cat-lover could enjoy that much of an overdose of this. It's way too much of basically the same stuff over and over and over again. The Webber tune ""memory,"" which is sung several times, is enchanting, but doesn't overcome the sheer boredom of the production taken as a whole enough to deserve 2 stars for this DVD."
4,CATS,My 8 year old daughter loves this DVD. I have to have her explain it to me because I just don't really get it......but she loves it.
5,Cats,Great show. We were surprised just how much our kids liked it. We are seeing the show live in January!
5,Great Modern day Opera/Play,If you don't get the opportunity to be there in person - get the DVD and experience the magic of CATs
5,Great DVD,I got this for my 6 year old grandson. He loves it. He plays it over and over again and likes to act out the scenes.He has become very interested in dance and can even identify the type of dance shoes each of the cats wears.
3,How Much Do You Like Variety Shows?,"The stage-to-video version of CATS neatly captures the effect of the London and New York stage versions. The performers are expert, the music occasionally memorable, the choreography and costumes exceptional, the scenic designs are pretty nifty too--but ultimately how much you like CATS will depend on how much you like variety shows. For CATS is exactly that: one long variety show, no plot, no story, just one musical number after another. Your reaction to the film--will rather depends on how much you like variety shows. Simple as that."
3,Commemorative Edition of Cats-Tje Misoca;,"As an avid Andrew Lloyd Weber fan and someone who has seen Cats no fewer that 21 times at various theaters all over the world, I was disappointed in this production. It did little to capture what it could have of the stage essence. It was too ""movie-like"" in how it appeared and very ""untheater-like"" even compared to other videos of stage productions."
2,Nice Costumes and That's Just About All,"I loved the ""Joseph and the Technicolor Dream Coat"" DVD and always liked the ""Jesus Christ Superstar"" soundtrack from way back in the 70s when I would sneak into my sister's room to listen to her records. So I thought that ""Cats"" would be a great addition to my DVD collection and bought it to share with my three year old daughter. I found it boring. The music wasn't that great. The story was uninspired in my view. To its' credit the costumes were pretty cool. I had to laugh this week when I saw Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central's ""Colbert Report"" say he had ""suffered through"" ""Cats"" because I felt the same way. So I'm not the only person disappointed. My daughter liked it, though. She probably won't want to watch it again, though, so I'll most likely put it up on e-bay."
4,"It was spectacular, but I wish they had not cut out the song","It was wonderful!! I could actually see the actor's faces:) They had spectacular special effects. However, I did miss their attempt at opera. Although they made up for it with the other song that is not on the CD. >^..^<"
5,Watch for the details. . .,"Despite what the professional reviewer states about something being lost in the video version of this magnificent musical, the details the viewer witnesses only add to the story, showing the actors' physical reactions,and emotions. If I were sitting in the 48th row, I would never have seen the joy in their eyes upon the return of Deuteronomy, among numerous other opportunities. I think you will enjoy this video, and isn't it nice, when you slip to the kitchen, that the incredible soundtrack plays on while you miss the scene. . ."
5,"""This astounding display of playful creativity is great""","When I first saw this on video, I was breathtaken. It was one of the greatest theatrical concerts I had ever seen. This will forever stay in my mind as being the best of the best in Broadway. Crystal Thompson, 14"
1,Horrible,This is no West Side Story. It is no My Fair Lady. This is no King and I. It is no Chorus Line.Webber's music is the most insipid tripe ever conceived. Nothing he has written has a shred of originality.Nothing can elevate this horrible mess to anything worth absorbing by the human mind.
1,wrecked my life,"This movie wrecked my entire life. it's so scary. do notlet a single kid see it, or they may wake you up for the next 8years and scream "" mommy! mungojerrie is here! LIVE! ""even if they are 3th graders. i can't even go down the hall because of ALW's plan to wreck our lives! well, he's gone now,so there's not a sequel of cats!"
1,CATS IS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Memory & Mr Mistoffelees and the magic of Elaine Paige and Sir John Mills were all that kept the ALW HIT? HIT? HIT? from being a total loss. At the end of the film I was as un-enlightened as at the beginning. If there is a PREMISE behind this show it completely escaped me. Was the plot left in the litter box? In my opinion, this production is a sham and a shame........"
1,What's the point?,I barely remember any of this except for Memories and 'The Rum Tum Tugger is a Curious Cat!' It's a stupid musical. People parading in costumes dancing on stage? And then they make it into a movie? Not memorable at all. Who ever thought this was a good idea?
1,ewwwwww!look how dirty those cats are!!!,"This is a day that will live in infamancy. If FDR was still alive, then he would have repeated this the very day that ""Cats"" came out on DVD. The content is bad, the voices are awful, the songs are bad, and even a past music teacher of mine was disgusted at the lack of taste. I highly reccomend you never to watch this movie."
2,"Meow, Meow, Meow. Who cares?","this movie isn't really good. the only thing that you get out ofthis movie is munchojerry and rumpleteazer. otherwise, it's terrible! the costumes are weird, the plot changes and changes.they never make up their mind about the plot! first, it's aboutthe jellicle ball , then grisabella dies, and it goes on and on and on! oh, and did i mention it's too long? it goes on for 2 hours. i can't stay awake long enough to even see the entire movie! it's boring. :\"
5,aweson,I brought it for 11yrs.old granddaughter who went to see them live in the month of March here in Philadelphia.Who have admired Cats sense she was two yrs.old. thank you very much Amazon for a clear and well stored DVD.Iwould use you again for service.
5,95% Puurfect!,"Cats: Now and Forever! I am a Cats lover and one of their most devoted fans. The new release on video is absoulutly GREAT! Aside from the fact that they lip-sync, James Barron's performance as Bustopher Jones isn't very good,they cut out ""Growltiger's Last Stand""(ouch!) butchered three other songs, they messed up no less than five very nasty camera angles(Ow!) and in the beginning, poor Jemima needs a Ricola.(!) Otherwise, it is just perfectissimo! The music is great, The singing and dancing are excellent, the music is awesome, the special effects are so-so,but the choreography, the make-up,their coats/costumes,their facial expressions and masks,and their concentration is exceptional. It more than makes up for the bad things mentioned above. Well worth the 17 or so dollars it costs to add this amazing video to your collection. A video for the whole family. Exquisite."
2,"The stage production is great, but the DVD...","I cannot bring myself to give this title more than two stars, although I love the stage production of this show. The singing and acting on this DVD are somewhat disappointing, and the original broadway cast sounded much better. The camera work is horrendous, constantly showing close ups when they should be panning out to show the wonderful choreography that was made for the stage. It seems as though there was no modification to the show to make it look good on TV. While I'm sure there are purists who are glad that there weren't any chages (""It's supposed to be JUST like the stage production""), it just looks bad on television.When I saw this version of the musical it was running on PBS. I noticed that a few of the songs were actually missing from the production and it was not complete. I realize that the songs may have been cut by PBS to fit the musical into an allotted time, but if this is not the case, the DVD just isn't worth it."
5,MEEEOWWW!!,"What can i say, I loved it! I watch it every day. I think it is the best thing since cable. And my friend loves it more than me!"
4,"It's good, but not the same as the Commemorative Edition","Any version of this production (Elaine Paige, Ken Page, et. al.) is going to be good.But before you buy, be aware that this is *not* exactly the same production as the year 2000 Commemorative Edition. The audio has been re-mastered, and the production uses some alternative takes that are not the ones used in the previous release.Probably I'm just suffering from the ""It's different from what I'm used to so it can't be any good"" syndrome, but I did prefer the previous version to this one. The ""Rumpus Cat"" scene in particular suffered from the changed audio in my opinion.If you've never seen this production of CATS, you will absolutely love this. I just liked the previous version a little bit better."
5,9 Lives is Not Enough!,"This is incredible! I've loved this musical since I was a kid and I read the script and T.S. Eliott's book The Old Possum's Guide To Practicle Cats (a must have for any Cats fan). I have never been able to be in London or New York at the right time to see it, but I hope someday it will return to Broadway. The video is incredible though, as you get a view closer than the front row seat and see the actors in and out of make-up. My favorite movie, it's a full night of entertainment and more!"
2,Cats the musical,"Well, I finally got to see Cats. I bought the DVD at a shop and saw it. Well, the production and the customes may look great to others. I found the show boring. So if you are looking for a unified theme and a purpose of theme, it is not really there. If you are looking for great, long lasting musical pieces, you would not find many, except for Memory. If you just want to see the show becasue it has so much fame, by all means. If you have high expectations, you may as well get disappointed."
5,"Thank you, Frank","I am not sure if I will ever be rewarded by getting the part of Victoria, but I think I will always be Victoria in the eyes of JFrank. He has so much faith in me, and equal amounts of kindness. He is the nicest person I have ever come across in my 16-year life. Recently he did the most generous thing anyone could do, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank him from the bottom of my heart. I shall never forget your kindness, and if indeed I perform in this magnificent musical, you will be the first to know, dear Frank. Thanks again for all you've done."
5,Cats: The Musical,I have seen this on stage twice in Chicago and this production was every bit as good as what I had enjoyed before!
5,Cats,We love the DVD and my grandkids keep asking to watch it! I recommend it to anyone who likes music and dance.
5,cats,i just loved cats dvd musical. it was great and purrrrfect. i guess you could say it was the cats me-ow.oh how i just loved it i just loved that musical when it first came out and now it is here now again toenjoy and hear forever now thanks to you wonderful folks each and everyone of you there. i so thank you.
5,It was wonderful!,"I was raised completely on musicals, and I had previously heard the music of Cats and read the poems of T.S. Elliot. I thought that the fact of it being available as a video was wonderful. Although Elaine Paige was wonderful, I was slightly disapointed however, that Betty Buckley was not Grizabella."
4,Lovin the music!,"hey musical-lovers,Im actually yet to see the musical in all its wonders but am currently using one of the songs for a school project and am loving the music! Not to sure how I'd like the real thing but if the mystical tunes are anything to go by, you've got yourself a good source of entertainment. An amateur production of it was put on at my dance school a while ago and it was very impressive without the expenses so if you consider this a reliable source, I'd recommend you and even myself to get out there and see what 'Cats' is all about. Just venting my views. . . but feel free to protest!"
1,severely edited attempt at Cata,"This is a severely edited and shortened atempt at presenting ""Cats"" This attemt to push this great musical on the public fades as only a small screen presentation of a ghosttly show, with star turns for people who do not deserve to be brought to the forground. Sir Andrew please reset this as show seen by the thousands who love this piece."
1,What a rip off...,"The ""extras"" were NOTHING more than another video tape with ""The Making of Cats"" on it. If you already own the regular DVD (same ""extras"" are on it), or if you got a chance to record it on tv (for free), provided your local PBS affiliate aired it when they originally aired the Cats video, then this thing is useless. I found it to be a complete waste of money."
5,Now and Forever on my video shelf!,"Not being able to see the actual musical before it closed on B'way, this was about as close as I could get and BOY, was it good! Now, I've said before that no one would EVER get me to see this musical, and now it's one of my favorites. You see, spandex+ dancing = scary... but anyway, great music, AMAZING dancing (Namely Victoria, Invite to the Jellicle Ball(And I know how athletic you've gotta be to dance to Jellicle Songs for Jellicle cats)) and... er... ok costumes (sorry, the spandex still gets to me...), awesome set, and (I'm running out of adjectives) supurb singing! A MUST for any serious theater fanatic (namely... me! Oh, and you too, Erin...)"
3,Great for the person who can't see it on stage.,For the last fifteen year from the moment I first heard the music of the London production I have wished to see the play on stage. Now that I have never had the means I can see the show maybe not as it appears on stage but with a means that tells the story of proper cats. The fact that many of the original cast have been gathered for this production makes it that much more enjoyable for me as the record I have has them on it.
2,it was okay but I just wasn't awed by it!,"I've never seen the musical Cats and We have the Broadway cast recording which I never really cared for except for a few songs, I was told that I probably didn't care for the cast recording because I have never seen the play so I rented this tape and it was somewhat enjoyable but I just didn't totally enjoy it, it was kind of weird, the plot was very confusing, it just didn't seem to make any sense. Cats is Okay but it just didn't thrill me as much as The Phantom of the Opera did. I'm not saying that people shouldn't watch this or like it but just giving my personal opinion."
2,It could have been better.,"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love everything about the musical - the live musical, that is. The video is awful! The cast does wonderfully, but the production value is horrible. The editing is choppy, the music is practically canned, and the addition of ""special effects"" makes me cringe. Some of the scenes are hacked to bits, especially Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer, and then there's Growltiger's Last Stand (the most amazing scene IMO), which was nowhere to be found! This video takes away all the intimacy and subtlety of the stage version. It's a decent video, but it doesn't, in *any* way, come close to reliving the magic that is Cats."
1,One of the longest MTV style videos on the market!,"First of all, the music is wonderful. I loved the show and all the music from it, and the music is there, in all its splendor, wonderful to listen to. But, if I want to hear the music, I listen to the CD. I was looking forward to a video that would capture my joy in seeing the staged performance. This doesn't come near! There are changes in camera angle every 3 or 4 seconds. Very effective for a 3 minute MTV video, but extremely annoying for a full-length video. Shows are choreographed to be seen from the orchestra section - that is, the front. This video shows the musical from the front, back, above, below, both sides, angled, you name it."
2,Reminds Me of Opera,"I enjoy live opera, but I don't like to listen to recorded opera. Something dies in the translation. Cats is similar. I can't put my finger on it, but something about this long running musical does not translate well when recorded. I imagine that millions of people who have seen the play will want this video. However, to be honest, my guess is that they want it as a souvenir, to remember the live performance and to show their friends. If you have seen the play purchase the video. For the millions who have not seen the play but have heard enough about it to be interested, do not get the video. This exposure does not do the play justice and will tarnish the experience for you."
5,A piece of excellence,Both the sound and the picture on this DVD is of the best quality. A definite good buy.
5,Sharing a bit of Broadway,"When I traveled to California to visit my Grandchildren, I brought along Cat's- the Musical Commemorative Edition. What a wonderful sharing time we had! They are already in community theater and now can hardly wait for Cats to be presented on their stage. Mmmmm, for which cat should they try out? What do you think, Grandma?"
5,I AM TOUCHED BY THIS!,"First of all, If I list everything about the Cats DVD, it will go forever. I think it's beautiful how Jemima helps Grizabella be happy again when everyone shunned her. I want to cry so hard when I see them shunning her, even though she wants forgiveness and acceptence. Also, (sorry A.L Webber) the DVD Cats is WAY better than the original version. I have the original version and it's ok. YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!"
3,great production - bad filming,I loved Cats and still do which is why I bought this. It is better than nothing and better than having just the music but the filming of the dancing is atrocious. Anyone who has watched films of dancing knows you don't cut off in the middle of a routine and pan to someone else or someones face but that is what they did when they filmed this. Don't buy it to see the dancing because it will just be frustrating. Maybe they will make a better film of it someday.
4,Worth getting,"I confess, I am i complete CATS fan. I love the musical and have seen the video countless times. The dancing is fabulous, the singing and characters were great too. The only thing I found disappointing was that most of the songs were cut short and they took out Growltiger's scene completely, which I thought was one of the best scenes. Overall, it's still a great show to watch on video.If you have not seen CATS before, or have seen it and didn't enjoy it, I can't blame you. I didn't enjoy it the first time i watched it, but I managed to get the lyrics of the songs off the net and information about the musical, so when I understood it better, I enjoyed it more. You'd be surprised how many websites there are out there dedicated to CATS. So if you didn't enjoy it 'cause you didn't understand it, I recommend getting hold of the lyrics and plot of the musical. It helps!"
4,Great...but not purrfect,"I think that this is definitely a must for any CATS fan or musicals fan. The video is well cast. They are all fabulous singers and dancers. The costumes are great. However, it isn't a great representation of the show, because watching a video of this particular musical doesn't give you the interaction you get from the live version. Aside from that and a few editing mishaps, this video is well put together and enjoyable. It's a great way to keep the magic of this show alive forever!"
5,CATS Video (Commemorative Edition),"The CATS Video is an excellent video, and also a great memento, because the Broadway show is closing September 10th. The video has many great voices (although many were dubbed) and the Making of CATS gives a real insight on how and why CATS was produced. If you want excellent family or individual entertainment, purchase this video set."
3,Worth buying but.....,For the music alone this DVD is worth buying. For the visual experience it only rates a 3. The editing TERRIBLE! Continuity is lost when you notice a cat in one place and a second later they appear clear across the stage. The directing is marginal. Too many tight shots when the whole cast is dancing takes away from the visual effect of the production. The cast is excellent. Too bad the editing and directing didn't live up to it.Instead of rushing this production out in 15 days they should have taken an extra 15 and did it right.
5,Kitty Litter on Sour Pusses,"I guess if some folks were given a fortune for doing nothing more than breathing, they'd find something to complain about. I can't understand why they want to waste our time writing negative things about CATS, when it's very clear most of us who loved the music, the cast, the total production, regardless of inconsequential flaws, really don't give a damn about the cat-hair they insist on shedding on whatever they brush against.And how about that Elaine Paige, writing and letting us know how she felt about doing the Grizabella role. That's class, Folks. She's clearly a cat of unashamed felinity, well deserving of the HeavySide Lair."
5,Cats Review,"In my opinon, it is the best musical I have ever watched. All the actors and actresses perform beautifully. I especially like Mr. Mistoffelees,Grizabella,Munkustrap, Rumpleteazer, Mungojerry, Victoria, Bombalurina, Demeter, Etcetera and Rum Tum Tugger. There are also many other cast members but my list is too long to write. I am a fanatic about Jellical cats. My best friend and I already memorized Victoria and Mistoffelees' dance at the start of the movie and we perform every time we get a chance. We are working on Mungojerry and Rumpleteazer's dance. We only know the first half of it but we are working our butts off. This movie is very good and you won't be sorry when you buy it. it will make you want to sing and dance all night long!"
3,"So-so on video, best seen in person","Having seen Cats on Broadway and in regional productions I was looking forward to owning this video. It's hard to totally mess up a musical as wonderful as Cats but the video comes close. Gone is all the charm that comes from the live experience (to be expected) but the video really suffers. ""Memory"" is the hightlight song, both on stage and on this video. Still, being able to get a so-so dose of Cats without a trip to the theatre is worth the price of the video. Just don't have too high an expectation."
3,"Fabulous, but can do without the lip-sync!","Have seen twice on stage. On the plus side the orchestration is beautiful, and you can really appreciate the costumes. Elaine Paige is wonderful!On the down side, you lose the whole effect of seeing it on stage. The real dissapointment is that the performers are all lip-synching, and some very poorly. That really spoils getting wrapped up in the performance."
2,It was very odd,"Mostly all I can say is that it is a very unique video and the music is outstanding, but the content is awful!"
5,ABSOLUTE THE BEST!,"What can I say about CATS? Being the 2nd longest running musical-{behind ""The Phantom of the Opera""} in Broadway history, not one word can describe CATS! Preformed in many countries around the globe, it became the most popular & became everyone's favourite musical. Eventhough I never saw it live, but the DVD is just as good as seeing it live. I just love it & so will you! A very great addition for any DVD library. NOTE: Bryn Walters who played ""Macavaty"" also plays ""Plato"" that does the elaborate dance w/Victoria at the Jellicle Ball."
3,cats,Picture a little blurry. Looks like a bad copy off of an old vcr tape. Not a remastered product.
3,Cats (The Musical),"Did not like musical/scene selection setup. Other than that, the DVD had great clarity and focus. As for the production itself, I thought it was superb."
1,I now understand why the show closed...,"This is a bad acid trip flashback nightmare. I honestly rented this movie with very high hopes. I live in a small redneck town, on a dead end street, with a video store on the corner..the ONLY video store in town. So it takes some GUTS for a male to rent Cats. Thank God I only paid a lousy dollar fifty instead of fifty smackers on a ticket for the actual show. This is the sort of thing that makes countless husbands everywhere say things like, ""A Broadway show...do we have to go?"" and it also makes Broadway look VERY VERY cheezy to the passerby. I ignored all warnings and tried to stomach this video anyway.. COMPLETE RUBBISH!!! T.S. Elliot's poems were fine on their own..But set to music and stretched out for an hour and a half? Not good man, not good. I think I am going to have to listen to only the ambience of the pipes in my wall for a WEEK to recover from this accident..HEED THE WARNINGS... or this might cost you a dollar fifty..possibly more. The end?"
4,"If you enjoyed the live production, you'll love this video!",The camera gets you up-close-and-personal. It's like being on stage with the players.
3,If you love the soundtrack you'll like the movie,"I've waited 12 yrs. to see this show and it was good, but not what I expected to see. They cut one of the best parts out of the show and also added something not even on the soundtrack. I first heard of CATS when I was 11 and fell in love with the music and try as I might, have yet to see the show live. Please put in Grumbleshanks last stand the next time you make this vidio. The one thing that really disapointed me was that I saw the show on chan.2 Boston and then spent $20 to own the vidio. It was the same show, we all thought the full show would be on the tape. Just next time make sure people know they are getting the same thing on tv when Joseph comes out next year. Other than that the show was great, keep up the good work. And thank Ken Page for keeping with us new generation CATS fans!"
4,Great fun!,"We saw the Broadway production several years ago, and this video rekindled those memories. No video can replicate the essence and intimacy of the stage production we saw where the ""cats"" climbed up into the balcony and through the aisles. We felt we were actually part of the scenery! The electric energy of the performance stayed with us for many years. I was at first disappointed with the video, but after taking my 4and a half year old grandchild to the National Theater this December to see Cats live (I now have a stagestruck grandchild who wants to grow up and be a CAT on stage!), I could compare the advantages of each. The stage production gives you the whole picture, and you sense the engery. YOu can look at the other cats during any solo, and they all respond in character! THe video lets you see CLOSE UP the facial expressions and the depth of character of each solo. YOu need BOTH!"
4,Highly recommended,"Funny and suspenseful. This mystery lets you guess some of the answers, but keeps you on the edge of your seat for the rest. Lots of plot twists. Chloe is determined and persistent and ignores what other people say. Levesque has a lot of common sense and is supportive of his step-daughter Chloe. Highly recommended. - Review by N.C., 16-yrs old, Biblio Reads Children's Book Review"
5,i'll cook when pigs fly...,"this cookbook has a wonderful variety of great, elegant, and easy recipes for casual entertaining with friends and families. i happen to love cookbooks, and this is a wonderful addition to my collection."
1,This cookbook,"Not so impressed, I was expecting a lot more interesting recipes than deviled eggs, and barbeque popcorn mix, and cranberry salad, to name a few of the dull recipes in this cookbook. This is a cookbook, I will never use. Before you spend the money for this uninspired book, buy instead Carmine's Family Cookbook"
4,featuring a recreated episode,"The plot: Following Bramwell Collins' announcement that he has married Daphne Harridge, Catherine's sister, he is devastated to learn that Catherine is pregnant with his child. After Catherine draws the designated lottery slip, her husband, Morgan Collins, takes her place inside the cursed room.One of the episodes in this sequence no longer exists. It has been replaced on this tape with the (intact) audio portion and an accompanying slide show. Plus introductory narration by the lovely Lara Parker, who I must say looks as lovely in the 1993 narration as she does in the 1971 episode."
2,product description severely lacking!,"I ordered this product thinking it was an actual Philips power cord that would fit my flat screen TV. I just received it today and not only is it NOT a Philips product (it is a ""Gemini"" product), the power cord is ONLY for portable radios and tape recorders which operate on a 110 volt current. This is a critical point of info that needs to be in the product description. The cord itself is also 10 years old though the package has never been opened (I ordered it ""new""). So please be aware of the specific use of this product before you buy it."
4,This helps me control arthritis,"I've done this twice now--used up a 100-tablet bottle of 262mg Boswellia Extract then did not order more, just to test the effect of going without... This is the last time. It's been two weeks and my most afflicted joints are again inflamed, stiff, and painful. I'm not doing anything else different, I can only attribute the increased inflammation to the decreased intake of Boswellia extract. For me, Boswellia's effect is subtle and I think cumulative over time, so you may need to take it a while before you notice a difference. I have experienced no side-effects, and I like this brand for the value. Definitely works for me."
5,Wonderful product,"Boswellia is wonderful and works great on keeping my fingers bending and less painful. Before I started taking it, I could not bend my fingers. A few weeks after starting to take Boswellia, I could make a fist. I take this in addition to Black Cherry Extact."
3,"It's works well, but the results are mild","I bought this for pain; I was pleased at the price; the product worked well enough, it just wasn't a dramatic effect. The price was right, delivery was on time, so it's not a bad deal. I have since purchased it again."
2,Not for me.,This product just did not work for me. I also gave a bottle to a friend and it did nothing for them. So maybe it will work for you but i would not be betting on it.Amazon packing and shipping time were great as always.
5,FJ Cruiser requirement for bicycle racks.,This solves the simple problem of being able to use a Yakima rack on the Toyota FJ Cruiser. The hitch appears to be bullet proof and quite heavy. The drop and extension work perfectly to allow the back door to open with the rack on. Get this and never think about the issue again!
5,If only I had read this years ago...,"This short, simple book has really made a difference in my life. I always used to get defensive when criticized and immediately try to shoot down the other person, explain myself or rationalize my own behavior. This book showed me why it makes sense to handle criticisim in a different way. (I won't give the skills away here, because Clinard explains them so well in the book. You'll have to read it!) The skills are very simple, and if you can go against your initial reactions to criticism and use these skills, it really works like magic in your interpersonal relationships. WELL worth the (price)!"
4,Wow...Beautiful Australia!,"Fortunately, my Toshiba HD-A2 with the latest firmware 1.5 can play this disc without any problem. I really enjoy this wonderful documentary. The PQ is great except a few scenes particulary the lifeguard competition which has grainy scenes. Overall the PQ looks stunning.The only small problem is some of the extra features can't play properly with occasional freezing. If you're not into the extras then this will be a great disc. Highly recommended!"
1,Poor Job,I got all four Discovery HD DVD's. Brazil and China work fine and Italy and Australia do not. I returned them to Amazon and the replacements did not work either. Then I started reading and found many other people with the same problem which is caused by a coding problem with these two disc's. It's a shame Discovery did such a poor job making sure these disc's were playable especially considering how few different models of HD DVD Players there are out on the market.
1,Will not play in my HD-DVD player,"This title will not play in my Toshiba HD-XA2 DVD player. It locks up the player and I have to turn it off and back on to get the player to function again.If you know why this might be, please do let me know. All other HD-DVD titles and movies I've tried play fine (have not tried another Discovery Channel title though)."
4,Discovery Atlas Australia Revealed HD Blue-Ray Dvd,"I have always wanted to visit Australia and this is the next best thing. In fact for me it is the Best thing putting my age into consideration, as I felt like I was actually there. It is such a vast country one could never see it all by travel alone. This dvd is highly recommended to travellers everywhere.Or to people who cannot afford to travel this is the next best thing."
2,Let down by poor narration,"Although this is an interesting program and very well produced with high quality video (as you would expect from a Blu-ray DVD), it is sadly, and badly let down by poor narration by Russell Crowe, with his boring mono-tone voice. He is not up to the standard required. Just why Discovery Channel chose him as a narrator is beyond me, when Australia has many excellent documentary narrators such as Jack Thompson.Would not have purchased this DVD if I had known who had narrated it."
4,My Review,A bit long but worth it! The pictures are very vivid and the senior citizens I showed it to loved it -- and they're a very tough crowd to please!
2,Discovery Makes Poor Films,"This is our second documentary by Discovery, and our second disappointment.The graphics were crisp and colorful which is why we got this in Blu, but the content and story were nothing but common and boring."
1,Horrible Narrator,"Guys, dont waste your time with this video. I have China, Brasil and Italy Discovery Channel and BY FAR...this is the worst one (I highly recommend the others!)Basically you can't hear the narrator. Crowe's voice is TOO low and its impossible to listen too. My girlfriend asked to turn on the ""subtitle"" function because it was sooo bad.....we both fell asleep within 10 mins. (Its doesnt support subtitle features)Again, don't purchase this series (Australia). HORRIBLE AUDIO!"
2,Supporting hardware for Australia HD Issues,"After a tremendous amount of research, I was able to get to the bottom of the issue w/the HD version of Atlas/Aust. Revealed. I have confirmed that a firmware update is available from Toshiba players that will resolve the playback issues. A Microsoft update is currently not available but will be soon."
1,Discovery Atlas Australia and Italy DOES NOT WORK,"I have done some researching online and found out that these 2 HD-DVDs have been recorded in a different way from the Brazil & China which do work. DO NOT ORDER this product until they have created a working batch. I have also spoken with Discovery Channel and they advised they are aware of the problem and are trying to get this problem resolved. I was advised to return the product from where I bought it and keep checking back with them. Be very cautious who you purchase this from. You dont want to order a defective title and then not be able to get your refund. The only ones working at this time as mentioned above is Brazil and China, you should be ok ordering those."
1,this dvd will not work on your hd dvd player,"i bought this dvd and it doesn't work with my hd dvd player (toshiba hd-a2). Beware not to buy this dvd it ""DOES NOT WORK ON YOUR HD DVD PLAYER"""
4,"Works well, could be heavier duty, but good for price","Fits as expected, works. Could be a bit heavier duty but for the application of oil filters on/off they are not supposed to be on tight. The OEM filter from Kia was on pretty tight however. Won't be a problem anymore."
4,Came badly damaged,"Well this item came badly damaged, bent out of shape. Obviously UPS's fault but also shows that the metal used for the product is not very heavy and can be bent easily. I attempted to repair it but it is still misshapen but not as bad as it was! It has no screws and therefore the rivets could pop. As for durability I am unsure on this product. This product does not seem all to durable in terms of being bent or impact but it might be very durable through this winter, we will be keeping it in a non climate controlled tool shed. I'll come back in the spring with an update maybe.Well built looks nice but not too durable against being bent."
2,Poor quality,Opened the box and took out the scoop and spade. Set down on the ground to see if it would stand up by itself. It would not. Put slight pressure on the handle and noticed the handle was half broken off the scoop. Very poor design.
4,No more plastic bags!,"I was so tired of walking around my yard with a plastic bag to pick up my dogs poop. So glad I invested in this pooper scooper. It's nothing amazing, but it does the job. The only thing that I find annoying (and thus why I gave four instead of five stars) is that spade is wider than the back of the scoop, so you can't easily scrap out the poop that's in the back 1-inch of the scoop. I would definitely not prevent you from buying the unit though!"
5,durable and just the right size,"this is our second flexrake. We got a second one due to needing ""his and hers"" rakes for our two great pyrs!the original is over 15 yrs old and sits out in the weather 24/7. still looks like new. A must for pet owners. We do have an unusual way of using this tool....we scoot it under the doggie's butt when they squat, catch the deposit and dispose in the woods! all very efficient!"
5,Flexrake Small Scoop,"Great tools! Perfect for the job and they are very lightweight. I would recommend these to any pet owner. I'm teaching my 7 year old son to use them and my husband picked them up right away to use over the shovel. I really like the long handles, makes it much easier to get those hard to reach presents."
4,Poop Scoop,My landscapers were using a stick and a shovel for portions of my yard that I had not got to the day of their visits. Both my Landscapers and myself very much appreciate the right length of this product and ease at which we are able to quickly clean up the yard post my dog (Riley's) little presents. Very well built and the ergonomic design is right on. Price is very reasonable as well. Thanks Amazon!
1,It is what is was meant to be!!!!,The scooper ended up being what it was meant to pick up!!! It litteraly fell apart the first time I attempted to clean up after a very small dog. But I was very pleased with my customer service and speedy refund given to me by Amazon!!!
1,GARBAGE!!!!,"Went to use for the very first time and scoop fell right off the handle. Not even screwed together, it's just punched together to hold it on the handle."
1,LITERALLY A CHEAP PIECE OF CRAP!!!,"During the first 3 minutes of use the thing completely fell apart. The ""bucket"" side of this is only held onto the cheap pole by 1 screw. A coffee can screwed to a broomstick would work better and would be worth more than this piece of trash. Hey, why didn't I think of that before? If I knew what a pile this would be, I could have just gone to the garage and built my own with much better quality in 5 min. or less. I purchased this over other products because it is ""Made in America"" and it turned out to be an embarrassment to carry that logo. I hate the feeling of being ripped off and this product did just that. Don't believe any reviews stating this is ""durable"" or has a ""quality design"" - they must have received something completely different."
5,handy tool,Bought the Flexrake standard scoop/spade 2-1/2 months ago to replace a similar set with wood handles that had rotted through. It is a comfortable length and since it is metal we expect it to last being left outside. The pan is big enough to pick up after two medium-size dogs every 1-2 days & more. Very satisfied with purchase.
5,best moisturizer,"I work in dermatology and was given a sample to try. I put it up thinking what a strange looking little ampule; then one day I thought I will give this a try. After applying this on my skin, it went on so smooth and without leaving any film. That was the best part is how smooth and soft with no greasy feel or film left on the skin. My skin felt so amazing and refreshed. My normal skin is oily and I have never had to use any moisturizer in the past; with aging I have found I do need something. I love this product it makes my skin feel wonderful and renewed with no film left at all on the skin. I have tried other very expensive moisturizers and they don't compare with this product. This is not a cheap product but it is worth it."
1,MUST SEE!!,"Lovers of trash B 70's movies don't pass this one by. You will be thrilled to have found possibly the worst movie ever made. From the insanely terrible script and sets to the horrific camera work and edits - this one has it all. The plot is completely nonsensical. Scenes are shot in rooms that sound like the microphone is a tin can. The fight scenes are wooden with obvious choreography. Every bit of acting - from the star to the bit actors - is completely ludicrous. Women give themselves over to the lead with no forethought. Virtually every action in the movie is without premise, as if the director was thinking this up as he went along. Bad, bad, bad. Super bad indeed. From the massive fros to the one-song soundtrack, this lemon is a must-see for those who enjoy scraping the bottom of the movie barrel."
1,Poor graphics- very poor manual,Just purchased the CMBB-SE version and what a disappointment this game is. Childish graphics and to top off the disappointment-the manual is missing 25 pages to it!?! It goes from page 1-128(stops in mid paragraph) and the next page is 153. To make it better it goes from page 153 to 176 AND then begins again at page 153 to page 240. Please do not buy this game-it is really poor. Buy Blitzkrieg or wait for Codename:panzers due out early next year. This game is a waste of money and impossible without a complete manual!
2,How I wasted two days,"Islandia is way over hyped. Not a bad world it has all the details you could want, it just lacks drive. I found I could not care about the big vote or any of the folks in the book. To be fair I am an avid reader and will read more [stuff] than I care to admit so maybe I came at this with a low brow view. The whole thing made me wish that I had bought something else with my money. I gave my copy to the libary, no one should have to pay for this book what I did."
1,snore...snore...,this is one VERY boring story with a VERY eratic plotnot well written at all. im glad i got it at thelibrary and did not waste my money. as if love and sexwere not confusing enough this makes it even worsethe only 2 neat things i seen were the map of islandiaand the roots of a artifical language.
5,A Good Read,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Ms. Dennis writes from the heart. The characters are engaging. The setting is full of details that make the story come alive. I am waiting for the sequel so I can find out more about this family. A good story, not formulaic like some novels out there.Billie Wroten"
4,ronnie wood in the back but in the lead,"Ronnie Wood's ""Anthology"" is a fine example of how our R&B has matured over the years. I'm in my 60's and I remember when Faces was just started to be played on the radio. I always liked the licks that he got in. It took me awhile to get to like that lead singer, What's his name Rod someone? Ronnie's music was what I thought held it all together. Yes, I know Rod Stewart and I own his ""Storyteller - Complete Anthology Box Set"". Ronnie's ""Anthology"" is something that I put on my iPod and enjoy."
3,What happened to the great Stones tracks from the 1st LP?,"Went down to see Ronnie when he was promoting his book. While he was signing, the store played a loop of tracks including ""Sure the one you Need"" and ""Get Yourself Together"" (or something like that) from Got My Own Album to Do. Figured they'd have to be a best of. Nope. They did include two Stones cuts on disc two that I'd rather have forgotten.Overall a fun set and I really enjoyed disc two a bunch, but I had to go and buy the first solo lp for those songs by Jagger and Richards. Ronnie is one of the guitar players who deserves more credit for shaping British rock and roll. Great musician."
5,a great musical,"I am a big fan of musicals and this is a great addition to the library of movie soundtracks. My favorite songs are Singin' in the Rain,Be A Clown and Good morning."
5,Adorable french comedy,"I watched this movie when it first came out and I looked for it on DVD for a long time. I love this sweet, funny, clever, quintessential french comedy. very happy to have found it."
4,Good selection!,"This disc has a very interesting selection of music from different nationalities. This disc is lots of fun to listen to, and the selections speak volumes about their country of origin as well as the country's place in history at the time.Dvorak's Slavonic Dance No. 1 and Copland's Hoe-down are both very exciting peices, and really stand out on this excellent disc.As always with this series, the liner notes are a good read and very well done."
5,Awesome.,I love these Spearmint Eclipse mints. So difficult to find this flavor - not only in the Eclipse but any brand. i do not chew gum & love Spearmint. Awesome mints & great tin doesn't break in a pocket and the lid keeps them fresh!
1,Less then one star,"I thought I'm Catholic, I love Mary, why not give it a shot. But this was a mistake. This woman took one of the most beautiful things about God's creation and turned her into a marketing product. A nice try to lure people into Annie Kirkwood's religious beliefs. This woman didn't know much about history (the way she had Mary relating to Joseph before marriage wasn't done in those days), or the Bible, or how to be subtle when attacking someone else's religion."
1,Mary's Message to the World,"I would love to review this book, but after waiting a couple of months you guys finally told me you can't get this book. Seems peculiar you wouldn't know that right away."
1,mary's message to the world,"The paper was of very poor quality. This was the second book of this title that I purchased. The first was of very good quality, but not this one."
1,deceiving spirit,"1Jo 4:1 Dear friends, don't believe everyone who claims to have the Spirit of God. Test them all to find out if they really do come from God. Many false prophets have already gone out into the world.This book is a perfect example of why we are to test the spirits. I too am Catholic and I love Mary, so I picked this book up. Within the first few pages alarm bells were ringing. She denies the Catholic Church has the truth, speaks of the ""brotherhood"" of God, says that all religions are the same, and later speaks of being reincarnated. She mixes a little truth in with falsehood - Satan's favorite trick. She fails the test of prophets - her prophecies did not come true.Don't bother with this book. It is deceptive at best and satanic at worst.If you are interested in genuine private revelations and words of Mary, check out Wayne Weible's books on Medjudgorje. You will immediately see the contrast between the true and the false."
3,Univ. of Chicago has a better dictionary,"I did own this dictionary. It gives pronunciation directions for English words, but NOT for Spanish ones. More importantly, I couldn't find definitions in the book for 4 irregular verbs listd. I went to online Spanish dictionary sites which had no definitions either. I called Cambridge Press, the publisher, and told them my concerns, but when asked, they weren't even interested in knowing which verbs were in question. I have exchanged this dictionary for a highly praised one published by the Univ.of Chicago."
4,We've All Been There,"Let's face it, all of us have been on one side or the other when it comes to food service. Many of us have carried the trays and dealt with the obnoxious customers. And pretty much all of us have had poor service and absentee waiters. This book comes to the rescue, and does it with a satisfying side order of humor.Not only will you learn the proper way to deal with delivering ""the vittles"", but you also get a wonderful guideline for taking care of that special waiter or waitress; when it's your turn to pay the bill.Highly recommended for everybody who serves and is served.Tim in Maryland."
4,No Scrooge Here,Even Scrooge would get a chuckle from this humorous look at Christmas. Read this anytime of the year if you want to get back into the Christmas spirit.
3,"Location shooting good, but...","...like the rest of Tony's most recent products, this turns into another commercial for Nik software.Don't get me wrong, Tony has been one of my absolute favorite photographers and producers of books and videos for many years, going back to his earliest offerings. But, this video and his previous book, Fine Art Digital Nature Photography, are way too Nik Software-centric.I know that he's a Nikon ""Legend Behind the Lens"", but I miss the days when he concentrated more on vision, composition, and field technique, with a little bit of attention paid to post-processing. Now it's become page after page and video after video of commercials for Nik and a few other plug-ins.But, this IS Tony Sweet, and regardless of how he gets there the images are stunningly beautiful, as always. You certainly can't argue with the results."
5,A SPECIAL BOOK,"Before reading this book I could only imagine what life was like for the most humble, yet greatest woman that ever walked the earth."
3,Not for every car,"Make sure that your headrests can be removed. I purchased this item thinking that all headrest are easily removed. I could not remove the headrest, contacted mercedes and they said it was not possible. Ended up returning this item."
4,Like it a lot,Great! Looks nice. Fits perfectly on the headrest. Like it a lot but would be even better with a bar for hanging pants too.
3,High end look,The wood color is very nice and sophisticated. More color options would be appreciated. it does rattle a little bit.
1,Don't buy it,"I bought it, but my headrests cannot be removed from my seat back...so they can't be installed. Wish I knew the headrest had to be removed to install these before I ordered it...and I wouldn't have. As it is, I used them as ballast in my trash can."
5,"Ze goggles, ze work!",I ordered these Speedo swim goggles after the strap from my old goggles snapped.They fit well after a lot of adjusting. The strap has an odd design that makes adjusting very tedious.The blue tint of the goggles makes for a strange swimming experience. Things will seem yellow after removing them.The goggles perform very well while swimming. They're very airtight and do not fog.
4,"Much better than most, still fog.","Much better than any goggles I have ever tried to use before, but they began to fog after the first few uses. I know it says to rinse them off after use, but I really don't think there's any way to avoid the anti-fog coating coming off... it just does. But, in general very good goggles. Good seal, comfortable, good range of vision. These have helped greatly in my learning to swim!"
5,"Good, I enjoyed.","I used these and I like them. I have a big head, but these still fit! I can see the bottom of the pool with no water leaking into and no fogs. I chose smoky color, so they do not see me, but I can see them. I do not want people to recognize me; when swimming, I am like a hippo bathing after eating full lunch."
5,"Excellent Goggles, really no fogging","I got them yesterday and was so excited aftering trying them. For the entire 40 minutes of my lap swim, it didn't fog at all, seriously. They snuggled to my eyes tight but did not left any line. I was originally planning on purchasing the Speedo Vanquisher Women but as they don't have the colors I want (I wear contact lens therefore need more color on goggle lens to deflect some light), I went for this model and they fit well. I highly recommend this goggle. The bonus point is with extra nose piece in the case, I was able to replace it on the broken one on my old goggle and it fits well. My previous goggle was made in Japan, non-Speedo brand."
1,Red eyes,"I normally use the cheap off-the-shelf goggles from Target for my swimming, but I thought I'd give these a try when they went on sale so cheap. Unfortunately, my eyes must be too large or too far apart or something, because I could never adjust these goggles so water didn't get in my eyes. They are smaller than other goggles I've used in the past, which probably explains it."
4,Good for intended use,"I bought these goggles for use swimming laps. I wear contact lenses and need the goggles to avoid the hassle of carrying contact lens periphenalia to the gym and to enhance underwater vision. I bought these goggles as they appeared better than bottom rung, but not too pricey. They work perfectly; keeps the water out, fog free. I'd recommend them for other swimmers seeking similar results. If you're really looking for competition goggles, I don't know how these would fare since I haven't used them in that context."
2,Disappointed,"I was hoping for perfection given the great reviews for this goggle - unfortunately it just doesnt seem to do its job very well. Water gets in every single time, and they fog up continuously. The fit became a little better after we swapped out the nose clip but the same problems persist. I'm going to have to find another swim goggle."
3,"The product is good, while the color is misleading","The product is definitely a good one. It doesn't get foggy, and really clear when using it.But the color is really misleading! I ordered the silver one, it looks good on the picture, and the color can really match my swimming suit. When I got it, it's just a light grey one. It makes me look stupid."
1,Foggy after 3 uses,"I used to be a swimmer and decided to get back into it, therefore, I needed goggles. I used to swear by speedo and tyr so I didn't hesitate to buy speedo goggles. These were the worst purchase. I know how to take care of goggles but no matter how well i took care of them they fog up after only swimming 200m. I would not recommend these goggles if you are wanting to swim numerous laps without stopping unless you didn't want to be able to see. Sad I spent the money on these when cheaper goggles could've proved to be better."
1,If you want bruised eyes...,"I've just recently started swimming at our aquatic center. They are tight but not uncomfortable. However, after wearing these Speedo Vanquishers for only an hour they bruise my eye sockets and make the hollows underneath my eyes even hollower. I have adjusted them just to the point where they keep out water, so they shouldn't be too tight. It takes almost 24 hours before the bruising goes away. They do keep out water and are fog-free. A woman who swims regularly at the pool said about the bruising, ""They all do that."" If so, I'm going to give up swimming. I asked the advice of a friend who has been swimming for years, and she just wrote me: ""You're wearing the wrong goggles! Get TYR."" She's a beautiful woman who has a public position -- she's on the city council, among other things -- and would not go around with bruised eyes. So I'm placing an order for TYR Nest Pros now."
1,QUALITY,"I would like to say about the quality of this product. The Seller is AMAZON, even though the quality is worse. Before buying this product i had trust on Amazon, I didn't even think that AMAZON provides cheap quality products. I was adjusting my swim goggles and the strap broken while adjusting. I would suggest not to buy this product."
5,First Time Swimmer,"I am a first time swimmer, someone who is still in the learning mode... ordered these to make it easy for me to learn how to dip my head in water when its necessary and still be able to keep my eyes open, as I generally shut my eyes tight when I try to dip. I haven't put them on while swimming yet, will do it this week, but when I try them on, they feel comfortable. I can just press the eye sockets a little bit and start feeling the vacuum and I am hoping that will keep the water out, will find out what happens in my next class. Will update this once I have tried it while in the pool."
1,feels like my eyeballs are being sucked out.,"OK, I don't normally wear goggles. But these are sooooo uncomfortable. They don't rest on bone -- my eyeballs feel like they are being sucked out. I am going to have to give them away."
4,Satisfied Customer,"I find this pair of google good. They provide good seal from water. The nose adjustements that come with it, may not be perfect for your nose bridge but still they dont hamper their performance.Overall a good product and much better than other cheap stuff available online."
2,Fogs quickly and not very comfortable,"I have tried to love these goggles as the reviews seemed so good. I have tried now for 2 months to get the right fit, but they are still leaving terrible marks on my face. The only advantage to the discomfort, is that in having to readjust the goggles every 4 lengths or so otherwise they hurt too much, I can defog at the same time. They fog after 2 lengths and are very foggy after 4 lengths. I rinse them in cold water after each swim and the fogging remains a big problem"
2,slight leak after six months,"the rubber around the eyes seems to be getting old or something after six months of use. now after a few laps in the pool there is a very slight leak. the first time i thought i'd put them on a bit differently, but it's happened again. it lets in a little bit of water if i move my cheeks or nose at all."
3,Nose piece broke quickly,"Although I like these goggles, my nose piece broke within two weeks of use! Glad they included a few others, and I hope the one I'm now using lasts."
2,These are too small for an adult male,"The main problem with these is size. They seem made for children or possibly women. I am a male adult and have swam laps for years using many makes and models of goggles. These are good quality except for two problems. The strap is too short for my head, so they compress too much. I don't have an exceptionally large head--average size--and these are just too small. The second problem is with the nose bridge piece. These goggles come with three sizes of nose bridges, however even the largest was not large enough for my nose bridge. Again, I do not have an exceptionally large nose. These are just too small for an adult male."
2,Fogs up,"Pros: Great comfortable fitting., Very clear view(Before fogging).Cons: Started fogging up just after using once. I did rinse etc."
3,They Fog Up a Lot,I bought these seeing how many great reviews it had but they fog up a lot. That's my only complaint from these so far.
4,Fantastic Indoor Gym Goggles,"I specifically chose a clear goggle so that I could swim indoors with it. The goggles work well in keeping water out and the fit is great. I am able to put the goggles on my face w/o the straps and the suction will keep the goggles in place. The fit feels natural to my face. Usually I have a hard time finding goggles that fit my face since it is a bit small, but there is the adjustable nose piece for different sizes. The view is also unobstructed which is good. It doesn't fog up, though I have not tried it after swimming more than 30-40 min, so I can't comment if it will fog or leak after that. All in all I think this is a great goggle for swimming indoors. The price is very reasonable also. Great goggles for the price and for anyone getting into swimming or is an intermediate"
3,Anti-fog Failure,"Right out of the package, these fogged up. I've tried spit and water and no matter what I did, I had to dip them after several laps. This has happened on two separate pairs, although they are fairly comfortable, the fogging is VERY frustrating and disruptive to my workout."
3,Speedo Goggle,I did not like the product; they are very difficult to adjust. I had a previous pair that were much better and easy to adjust so I gave these to my grandaughter.
2,"Great for 4 uses, then they broke","I bought these because of the high reviews combined with the lower price. They looked great, and felt great once properly adjusted. I used them four times in a local YMCA pool and immediately washed them off in tap water afterwards. As I applied a slight bit of tension to pull them onto my head the band snapped. I had to knot it together or give up on goggles for today's swim.I would have given them 5 stars for great goggles, but due to the incredibly quick breakage I have to go down to 2. I did email Speedo themselves, so I'll update if anything comes of this. Not sure if Amazon will do anything as it's past the return window."
4,alangs84,"Great product, work very well for what I use them for.I swim on a regular basis for excercise, and these were rated one of the best for the use that I use them.The are weird to adjust at first, but once they are adjusted correctly, they fit like a glove.Very good product."
4,I really like these goggles,"I'm new to swimming, but theses are my second pair of goggles and I just really like them. They are comfortable, they don't leak, and haven't fogged up on me yet. I think when my current pair runs out I'll just buy another of the same. I recommend them."
5,STYLISH GOGGLES FOR A GREAT PRICE,The Speedo Vanquisher Swim Goggles are a great buy. I just started swimming on a consistent basis and needed some good goggles for the pool. I purchased these about 2 months ago and absolutely love them. The goggles are very stylish but more important are very comfortable. They stay pretty clear for quite some time but eventually fog up slightly. Not a big deal though because almost all goggles eventually fog up. Great product and I believe anyone who purchases these goggles would be happy with their buy.
1,Extremely dissatisfied,"I got this just yesterday. However, the straps are of poor quality and one of them broke/tore while trying to adjust it. They are way too tight to adjust easily."
2,breaks too easily,"I've purchased two pair of these goggles. The seal is excellent, and the first pair survived four years of heavy use (2007-2011). They are still usable for horsing around but not for laps--the rubber is a bit worn.The second pair (the one being rated here) lasted only 1 year of not-so-heavy use before the part of the goggle that attaches to the nose bridge broke. C'est la vie.I then bought a pair ofSpeedo Vanquisher 2.0 Goggles. They broke the same way after 6 months of light use.At the advice of Speedo customer service, I mailed both defective goggles to Speedo, but several weeks later I have not heard from them. I conclude that Speedo' quality has gone down and that they don't care.UPDATE: after two months, Speedo sent me aSpeedo Vanquisher 2.0 Gogglewith no explanation or anything. I had sent a print-out of my amazon receipt for those. After six months, Speedo sent a second pair, again with no explanation."
2,tight and painful,"I bought this after reading zillions of positive amazon product reviews. I would term my face a normal size female face. These goggles are super-tight and leave deep impressions on my skin. I tried these twice with a time gap in between of 1-2 days, but still very painful. Sadly, I think the time window for an amazon return has gone. I do not recommend them."
2,Fogs up!,"It came in a neat packing with all contents as described on page. It has a great finish and the straps are easy to adjust. Its snug and creates proper suction, keeping water out. It's biggest flaw is that it has been fogging since first use and I have to clear them after every lap! Not much usable I'm afraid."
3,Good-Not great,"Fairly uncomfortable despite me trying to adjust them, always end up having raccoon eyes by the end of my swim. That being said, they don't allow a drop of water in and seem very durable. However, the anti-fog feature they claim to have only existed on my first swim and ever since then they fog up every workout."
2,Great goggles but doesnt serve the purpose,The goggles are great but they dont serve the purpose of anti - fog ; the main reason why i bought them.So its a no go for me.
3,Okay,"These goggles aren't the best. They are a bit on the uncomfortable side, the silicone covering is pretty minimal so the goggles dig and pull at the skin. They also fog up a lot. I rated them a 3 because they get the job done."
4,Very good,"This was my third buy of a swin google, and think this is the best.Good quality , very adjustable and with a very good look in the water.Perfect for swimming."
4,Pretty Good Goggles,"The seal around the eye(s) is fantastic. The split head band easy to adjust and stays put. The anti-fog film is the best I've ever had (36 years of experience). It lasts for about 45 minutes for me. I'm not exactly sure why it gives up when it does, but until then, it's flawless.The only gripe I have is the fit around the bridge of my nose. Even with the largest of the nose fittings (a package of assorted sizes come with each pair) I am left with divots in my nose at the end of my workout. The seal and anti-fog (until it fails) is so impressive that I still choose these googles over several others that I have. If I had a smaller nose I'd be in goggle heaven."
1,uncomfortable,"nice goggles but extremely uncomfortablethey hurt my eyes after ten minutes of swimmingtry the tyr velocity goggles used them for yearsand they were never uncomfortable, I just bought apair after swimming once with these speedos"
2,"inexpensive, but not recommended","It was a nice looking one, decent make, named brand.Air and fog makes this pair no use almost at all time, not recommended."
3,Too small,"I wear a 7-3/4 hat size and these goggles barely fit my head. As a result, unless the goggles a placed PERFECTLY on my eyes, they leak. If you have a smaller head they should work just fine. Despite the shortcoming, I use them 3 days a week. When I get around to it, I will probably go to a sporting goods store and ""try on"" another style or brand for a better fit."
4,"peforms well, fits well","i've had about a month or so to wear these goggles, and i really like them so far. the construction of the googles are very well made. the cushion around the goggle lens are supportive, and create a well fit to keep the water out. a couple drawbacks (minor), are the fogging of the lenses. i tried applying anti-fog to them, seemed to work for a few laps, and start fogging again. the adjustment band does take some time to ensure a proper fit, but once it is set, you won't have to re-adjust after. i actually ordered another pair of these, because the band broke when i stretched it over my head. dissapointing because i have only used them about a dozen times."
2,foggy,"It has a good looking. I liked it when I received it. However, it's not good enough as the old goggle I had. It's foggy after several minutes I used. It makes me very disappointed."
1,worst goggle i ever have,"i have to say this is the worst goggle i have ever had, it is totally unclear in water, lots of bubbles inside, you just can not get rid of them no matter what you do, the attached plastic container is too soft to use, so i am strongly suspicious this is a fake Speedo product.now, i just throw it away, just use the nose bridge attached to fix my old goggle and use it, the old one is a good goggle, still very clear after 3 years usage."
1,Most paintful,Can't go wrong with Speedo products right? Wrong! Major leaks and most painful below the eyes. Big mistake on my part.
1,Bad nose bridge,The excellent features of these goggles is that they do not leak or fog!!!!! Yahoo!!!!! Disadvantage is that the nose bridge is plastic. Sure it has 3 different sizes for the bridge but the actual part of the goggle that sits on your side of your bridge is also plastic. It digs into your nose after time and hurts. I wore them twice and threw them away. Great price but not worth the investment unless you can handle the bridge.
2,"""Anti-fog"" must not be a ""factual statement""...","My first pair started fogging up within a week of use. I bought an anti-fog spray but hated having to use it so frequently. Thinking I might have done something wrong like touching the inside of the lenses, I bought another pair. This time I was very careful to not touch the lenses and followed all of the advice on maintaining the anti-fog coating. They started fogging up within a week and a half. If I were to buy these again, I would not be doing so for the anti-fog ""feature."""
2,Anti-fog is a joke,"I started using these goggles as I was training for a triathlon, but now I'm looking for another pair. After less than 10 trips to the pool, the anti-fog has completely worn out, and now they fog up completely within 3 laps- not gonna be good in an open water triathlon. I took care of the lenses as required- rinsed them with fresh water after use, never wiped the inside with anything, but after a few times in the pool I started to wonder what the weird line thing in the middle of my vision was, and saw later that it was the anti-fog coating flaking off. Annoying.On the other hand, they fit nicely and were comfortable once I got the right nose-piece in there.They did ok sealing, but they did leak once in a while which caused me to stop and adjust (chlorine is very high in the pool I train in).If you never sweat while working out, you'll be ok. If you're a normal human being (and you like to be able to see where you are going), stay away from these goggles."
2,Not that great of an investment...,"I purchased these based on the reviews on Amazon and I was expecting them to be decent for recreational swimming. The day I opened them and used them, about an hour into swimming laps, they started fogging up real quickly! I was really disappointed considering the packaging says ""Anti-fog"" on them. Aside from that, they are comfortable and they fit well! If you're looking for goggles for everyday use, don't invest in these."
1,Cell phone charger not as advertised!!!!,"I ordered a charger for my LG VX6100. This seller advertised the charger as compatible with my phone. When the charger arrived, it came with an invoice that said it was only compatible with about half of the phones it was supposed to work with. It did not work with the VX6100, as clearly stated on the enclosed invoice, but contrary to the advertisement on the web site. The item only costs $4.50, so it does not pay to return it. Buyer BEWARE!!!!"
4,I was there,"This PPV was in Chattanooga, TN and I was there. the main event was great. There was an interview that was before the PPV buy Stone Cold where he trashed the other opponents in the main event. It was great!"
1,Garbage,"The pay per view was pretty awful with no good matches. Even the main event stunk. May I suggest people buy WWF Backlash 1999, with the Rock and Austin in the Main Event. Thanks JC ICE"
1,bad,"This was the worst one I have ever seen. Don't read the other reviews, because they are wrong. This was absolutely terrible. P.S. Just kidding, I've never seen it-5 stars."
3,In Your House: Final Four,"This event was the WWF's 1997 February PPV. The main event picks up where the 1997 Royal Rumble left off. The Final Four match for the vacant WWF Championship between Bret Hart, the Undertaker, Stone Cold Steve Austin, and Vader. A bloody mess and a new Champion...What else can you ask for in a good match? Also on this event, Rocky Maivia defends his newly won Intercontinental Championship against the man he defeated, Hunter Hearst-Helmsley. Wildman Marc Mero takes on Leif Cassidy. Goldust, Flash Funk, and Bart Gunn vs. The Nation of Domination (Faarooq, Crush, and Savio Vega) in a 6-man Tag. WWF Tag Team Title Match between Champions-Owen Hart and the British Bulldog and Challengers-Doug Furnas and Philip LaFon."
2,IYH: Final Four,"First of all, this video was not that great. Don't get me wrong here, I thought the main event was a really great match. For the most part of the video, it was slow and boring. There were a few good matches, but that's about it. I would only reccomend this video to the real WWF fans out there!"
5,Final Four,"Leif Cassidy VS Marc Mero: Crappy gimmick aside for Cassidy, this was an excellent match.Farooq, Crush, and Savio Vega VS Golddust, Flash Funk, and Bart Gunn: A decent six man tag match.Rocky Miavia VS Hunter Hearst Hemsley: A good match between the two. They had a good feud early in both there careers before they made it to super stardom.Furnas @ Lafon VS Owen Hart and British Bulldog: I dont know whatever happened to Furnas and Lafon but they had looked good in this match. Too bad it ends in a DQ.Hart VS Vader VS Austin VS Undertaker: One of the greatest fatal four way matches ever created. I dont know why this is not on a dvd set but it should be. An excellent match.Overall, a good PPV. The main event is well worth worthing."
1,Didn't and wouldn't purchase this,This menorah has 6 candle holders (plus the shamos). Hanukah menorahs have 8 candle holders for the 8 days of Hanukah. d'oh?
3,One classic and one desperate last gasp,"Ma & Pa Kettle was one of my favorite movies when I was a kid and Saturday afternoon TV wasn't ALL sport. Just seeing them in their 'ultra-modern' new home brings back great memories. Pa Kettle is great as the man who wants to do nothing married to the hardest working housewife in the world with too many kids to count. As with all of these movie series from the 40's and 50's this starts on a high and gradually slides downhill, losing the stars as it goes on (so nothing has changed there). The first couple of movies can be watched over and over, but I think the last one could probably be filed after one viewing."
3,"The last Kettle film, and a new Pa...","This is the last of 10 films featuring the Kettle clan, perhaps there should have been 9. The second film without Percy Kilbride, this one introduces Parker Fennelly as the replacement Pa. While he does well in this role, after 8 Kilbride films, casting another actor in his role was a bad idea. Also, the film lacks the touch of Charles Lamont as director, who helped create the truly classic Kettle films. This film is interesting as the final Kettle film, the only one with Pa played by someone other than Percy Kilbride, and Marjorie Main's last film. The story is mildly entertaining, but suffers from simplicity, and a reliance upon the comedic legacy of previous Kettle films."
5,Great workout!,"This dvd really gives a good workout to the beginner. It has a variety of activities that keep it interesting for you. I especially like the warm up segment. It gradually prepares you for the other workouts. All in all, I would definitely recommend this dvd to anyone wanting to start an exercise routine that isn't too demanding and strenuous. For more SPARKPEOPLE products go to their website,[...]"
5,Great workout!,This is a great product. You can mix and match the exercise or simply do a 10 minute cardio. It's better to complete a 10 minutes cardio in a day than doing nothing at all.
4,Lots of Cardio,This is a good exercise DVD to have if you want an intense cardio workout in 10 minute segments. Its a good travel DVD. Its envigorating! Builds stamina!Note: May be too difficult for people with knee problems.
3,Ok in a pinch,I think the dvd is good for days i cant get out. I would not use this dvd as my only cardio. I think Nicole explains everything well and she is not too chatty. This dvd is good for a prerson new to working out but not for some one who is a big girl like me. I was expecting more for people of different levels but a good dvd if thats your only choice.
2,Not what I was looking for.,"This is more for people just beginning to exercise or maybe older people. Not enough of a calorie burn for me, and I don't really consider myself in shape."
4,Surprisingly Good Workout,"I am a member of sparkpeople.com and won this video. It sat on my entertainment center for a while before I tried it because my experience has been that their video productions are no fuss. This is true! But I worked out for 30 minutes with Coach Nicole and was really feeling it! She has six different workout themes on this video, and they are all challenging and can all be adjusted to a person's fitness level. Each theme is approximately 10 minutes and you combine them or the video will also combine a series based on beginner, intermediate, or advanced. Give it a try! It's a great workout and Coach Nicole is so nice you want to do a great job for her!"
4,good for a quick workout,I purchased this dvd because I have the Speakpeople 28 day Bootcamp and really enjoy it. This video has multiple 10 minute segments of cardio. I plan on using it to add a worout before work. These workouts are not too difficult and are short but you have the option to combine them into a longer workout. It isnt as good as the Bootcamp DVD but I would recomend it and the price is right.
1,Product received defective from DiscountJungle.,Cannot review this item since it was received defective from DiscountJungle. It was returned and merchant refused to reimburse shipping charges. They stated that was the chance I had to take. Advice... not to do business with this merchant.
1,This Thing Is A Piece of Junk,"Don't waste your money. It uses a ribbon, which jammed and tore the second time I used it. They've sealed the cartridge, so you can't patch it. AVOID."
1,Never recieved the Casio cw75 got Casio Cwk-85 unstead,"I told Amazon I got wrong item but will try to make it work, after a dozen DVD's and several ink cartridges used I did come up with a format that might work. Amazon did email and say they'd give a 20% discount for keeping wrong item, I'll see if I get it"
1,Casio Disc Printer,Horrible print quality. They do not tell you in their description of the product that it only works if you use the blank CD's they sell. They cost twice as much as the ones you can buy in any store. Don't waste your money!!!
2,casic dise title printer,"The casic disc title printer i purchase works fine if you are not trying to print fast.also you are going to have to purchase a lot of toner because they don,t last long."
2,"It is all right, but primitive","It is a simple gadget. It does the job for simple tasks, although it is surprisingly cumbersome. One color at a time. One side at a time. The keyboard isn't intuitive. The shift key doesn't change the case; I found that I have to lock the caps for individual letters. The number of fonts is very limited. The number of symbols is too restricted. One can connect it to the computer and do more, but I have a Mac. It is possible that greater versatility is there if I really read the instructions more carefully or experiment more, but that is not how I like to spend time."
2,Casio CD/DVD Printer,"Prints to CD/DVD's ok but the tapes are very expensive,hard to find and don't last very long!! Also does not include the AC adapter which is also hard to find and too expensive when you do find it! Out of the box you have to install 8 AA batteries that don't last very long either!!"
3,Casio Disc Title Printer,"So far so good. Fairly easy to use for simple titling projects not employing much in the way of graphics, though it has some basic capability I've not yet explored. Will use my Epson R220 for more elaborate needs. Have only had mine couple days, but initial use has been very good. Sure beats titling with a Sharpie. Very pleased with mine."
4,TERRIFIC!,"The only drawback is that you have to buy printable cd's and dvd's. Other than that, it's perfect."
1,Poor results,"I was hoping for a neat and simple way to print titles on my CD-R and DVD collections. I found neither with the Casio Disc Printer.I tried a total of 15 CD-R's before returning the item because I could only get accurate printing on 6 of the discs. I was trying media from Maxell,Sony, Memorex and while the printer would work on some brands once it would fail the next time.Also the printing area is very small. I believe it is only 1/2"" high on the top and bottom. It is very difficult to get much information on the disc except fot the Title and Artist.For now I have gone back to labeling by hand, but if anyone can tell me of a better solution I would love to try it."
3,The Casio printer: good choice for the casual user,"This printer was fine for my purposes but is pretty limited and would not be a good choice for someone seeking flexibility and heavy use from the device. It's slow and pretty persnickety in requiring a very smooth disc surface. Fonts are limited too. For the price, though, it's not bad if you can accept its limitations."
4,Ink Management?,"I'm very happy to have bought this printer. So much so, that now I'm thinking of re-recording all my other cds. My handwriting looks really awful now :-)Anyway abut my question. It's really for the Casio People. Have you seen how much ribbon your machine misuses between prints. There must be at leas 3 inches discarded (not used) between labels. I really thing you should reconsider this is a lot of waste."
5,Another winner from Dunne,"I'm a fan of Pete Dunne. He has this way of teaching while entertaining, making memory efforts painless. This book is another winner, along the same lines as his other works. The coolest thing is that he offers hooks to trigger memory, fun stories. Critics can certainly point to heavy anthropomorphism in this volume. But I'm willing to forgive that in the interest of bringing one closer to what raptors are all about.Dave"
4,An accessible way to learn about birds of prey,"Very informative, and a novel idea to have characteristics of these fabulous birds revealed in short stories. Sometimes, however, the anthropomorphic aspect is something of a put-off--too unreal. Beyond that small quibble, Mr. Dunne's book is a painless way to learn about some amazing birds."
3,Trying to like the series...,"The book starts out great then slows in the middle, then from out of no where is wrapped up in the last chapter. The London trip seemed like it was thrown in to take up pages. There didn't seem to be any big surprise as to who the bad guy was and I didn't seem to rush myself reading this book, more like having no interest in picking it up to finish it. I really want to like this series, but the characters seem to be missing something...."
3,I was hooked and then let down at the end,"This book had all the hopes of a great one. Feinstein is awesome at holding interest with all of the excellent behind the scenes action of the life of an assisstant DA. That is what I loved about the book. I thought Alex's stint in London was a bit too long and really didn't have much to do with the plot. But the ending is what got me. There was no surprise and not all of the loose ends were resolved. The book went from a 5 to a 3 in about 10 pages. I spent one whole morning reading the last 100 pages, couldn't put it down and then kicked myself for wasting all that time.Hopefully, Feinstein has improved her endings in the series, otherwise I'm going to have to give her up."
1,Very boring,"This book is very boring. She tells us everything people are eating and wearing. She gives a running dialog between people that has nothing to do with the story. I started skipping through paragraphs & finally about half way through the book, I went to the last few pages to find out who the murderer was."
2,Drags on....,"I normally finish a book every couple of days...I was stuck on this one for four times that long! I can't put my finger on why, except that the characters just never caught my interest. The plot was weighted down with so much unneccesary detail, it took forever for things to move along. Not the worst book I have read, but no where near the top either."
3,this book doesn't live up to it's potential,"Although this book had many of the essential ingredients for an exciting thriller, including an obviously knowledgeable author and an interesting storyline, the plot was weak and the reader is bombarded with many useless and tedious facts. The going was slow at first, but the book had some interesting portions (I liked the references to other cases and the fact that the murderer's identity was a surprise until the end). The book was worth reading, but not the page-turner that I had hoped for."
4,Authentic and compelling,"It's obvious that Linda Fairstein, who works in New York's District Attorney's office, really knows her stuff. This novel is a gritty legal thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seat. I liked the characters, especially Mike, the homicide detective. I also liked that the plot was complicated but never confusing."
3,Meh..,"I'm going to make this quick and dirty. The story is 400+ pages. You can cut out about 300 and still get the full gist of the story. While the plot is certainly not bad, there is WAY too much banter and unnecessary character building. I really could care less about Alexandras furniture color, her coworkers personal lives or that she drives a Jeep Cherokee. Just tell me who dunnit! ;)"
1,DNF,"This was my first attempt to read one of Linda Fairstein's Alex Cooper novels. If this novel is anything like the rest of the series, this has to be the most overrated mystery series EVER. I was bored stiff by the meaningless details and characters included in the story and a lot of the main character's dialog felt like I was being lectured to as if a small child.The rest of this series may be fantastic, but I guarantee you I will never know because there is no way I would ever read another one of Fairstein's books."
3,Not a bad read,It took me over two years to get around to reading this. It read easily and kept my interest and thus it rates as a good summer read. Be sure to read the first one before plunging into this one.
5,Really works!,First received this product from my integrative medicine doctor. It worked better than the precription meds I was on. Highly recommend.
5,D-Hist,"This is great for allergies, with no side effects. We have two children with air-borne allergies and they love D-Hist, because it works!"
5,Great alternative to pricey OTC medications!,"I absolutely love this product. It REALLY works without harsh side effects. I was reliant on Claritin for a long time and would have to deal with the light headedness and nausea that came along with it. Not to mention the price! It averages $2.00 a pill for a 10 pack at my local drug store. Yes, Natural D Hist requires more dosage initally but after 7-10 days I only need to take two a day to maintain. Definitely try this product!"
1,Didn't work for me,"It's been 2 weeks and I have been taking 6 capsules total a day, and I have had no improvement. Being such a bad season for allergies, I opted to try this product after seeing a story on Yahoo about it. It was worth trying something natural, but this didn't work for me."
4,Better than a prescription!,"I have been taking prescription and OTC drugs for years for my allergies, but they never really worked. After starting DHist, I noticed a huge improvement! Unfortunately, the effects only last as long as you're taking it. But I feel so much better, and no sinus infection!"
4,Just can't tell!,"I bought this for my son, who has been ""stuffy"" for years. I know he is allergic to something, but just can't seem to figure it out. Thought this might do the trick, but it didn't help. I sometimes get seasonal allergies, but since now is not the ""season"", I have had no reason to try them myself yet.I give it 3 stars since I know by the ingredients they are not bad, but I really don't know yet if they are great.***Update***I did end up trying them during the allergy season and surprisingly they worked pretty well! They didn't make everything go away completely, but they definitely improved some of the symptoms. I would now be willing to recommend them to friends."
3,D-HIST workds,It is working as it was described. Came on time. I am happy with this product and will recommend it to others.
2,"Wasn't effective for me, however","I was very hopeful about this product based on all of the reviews and because of several of personal recommendations to try the product. Unfortunately this did not significantly help with my symptoms. Although this product did help thin the mucus and allow some drainage, it only relieved a minor amount of congestion and it definitely was not effective enough to address sinus pressure and headaches. To be fair, as with most supplements and/or medications, I think it varies from person to person in terms of how it affects the body so even though it did not work for me, it might be helpful for others. The downside is that the product is pretty expensive so if you can try it first somehow before purchasing, I would recommend that so that you don't end up wasting money."
3,GOOD BASICS,"THIS BOOK IS VERY GENERAL, POSSIBLY FOR THE NOVICE TO FORM A BASIS FOR BUILDING AN ENGINE. IT'S NOT FOR REFERENCE, NOT ENOUGH DETAILS."
2,"Great for a beginner, nearly worthless for more advanced readers","Another book that I had high hopes for, only to be let down. I was looking for some real insider secrets from a leading engine builder. I spent 10 years in the engine rebuilding business and now do it only as a hobby. I am always on the lookout for great books on the subject. This book is not one of them. Smokey Yunick's Power Secrets is a much better buy, although it doesn't talk about fuel injection. If you are a beginner in the engine building world, then by all means read this book, then read Smokey's Power Secrets."
3,A Mass of Generalities,"I consider this book to be an excellent source for understanding terminology related to the subject. It's comparable to an extended glossary. It has great explanations, but it lacks the specific detail that I wanted. Also, some of the advice seems a little silly. For instance, he says that it's okay to experiment with a camshaft because they're so cheap to replace."
5,Well written and entertaining,If you like history you will like this book. Sometimes the book gets a little to in detailed for my taste but overall it was entertaining. It brought to life the town of Oberlin as well as the politics that surrounded the years leading up to the Civil War.
5,A fascinating look into what led up to the War Between the States,"Reading this book changed the direction in which my recently finished novel went! My historical novel, A Small War in Paradise, grew and improved because of what Mr. Brandt so skillfully explained. Not only educational, but inspiring and an exciting read. Kudos."
3,You gotta' love the doctor,"One of the worst books in the series. You really have to love the Doctor to slog through this book that has him crawling on hands and knees, naked, at the end of a leash being held by a sentient toy poodle. Really."
4,"A great piece of equipment, but!","I have shopped around for about a year looking for the right recorder and I've found it. The 785 is an excellant one with a few minor exceptions. The instruction book is not as clear as it could be and the video is just about useless fortunately I have been in electronics for many years and have used a cd burner on my computer. With a little reading and experimenting anyone will be able to use this recorder. If your not electronically inclined and have a friend who has a cd burner or some electronic knowledge give them a call. It is well worth the effort. The other problem is with Maxell cds, they do skip on other players so I would avoid them. I would suggest that when you buy your recorder pick up a CDRW music cd and practice on that. Maybe Philips should include one of those instead of the CDR disk. I would give this recorder a five if it were not for the instructions. The 785 is well worth the extra time you might spend learning how to use it."
1,Hopefully you're reading this before you purchase,"I agree with the others that the instructions do not provide adequate direction. A lot of the user's education on this product comes by way of trial and error. There are certain CDRs that won't work, as has been noted in prior reviews. Advanced features like fade out are mentioned, but there's absolutely no instruction. I've also had problems with the laser. Often I'll hear a few seconds of silence on my recordings. I'll be taking this product back today and doing more research before my next purchase."
1,Philips has lost its credibility.,"Philips, once an innovator and giant among electronic recording pioneers (they first mass marketed the cassette recorder/player), are now producing crap of the lowest level. I have tolerated the CDR 785 for almost two years and:1. The CD burner NEVER worked properly, finally dying completely (and eating the unfinalized cd!); and2. It is among the most user-unfriendly devices I have ever owned, particularly in regards to the manual and the recorder.As a 3-CD carousel PLAYER, it is fine, but...it cost $379.00 new, and I recently bought a 5-CD changer for slightly over $100.Ridiculous amount for a piece of over-hyped garbage (remember the TV ads for the ""party mix"" CD burner...?).Truly a sad day for a one-time pioneer in entertainment technology."
3,First problem with my Philips CD Recorder,"It has performed reasonably well since I bought it about a couple of years ago. The recorded discs sound good even when played back on a Wadia 861 (that is the standard one would classify as ""the best""). But... recently when I try to record on the new CDs from imation it keeps on displaying the ""OPC Error"" message and refuses to record. I have read reports from other people and this seems to be quite a common problem that is associated with ""disc mismatch"". The problem is that you don't know until you buy the blank discs, and if it won't work your whole spindle of CDs will be wasted. Philips' technical support is hopeless, realistically don't expect a reply. In summary, its a good recorder as long as nothing happens, but if it does you're on your own without help."
2,Not Recommended,The operating manual is very poorly written. Once you work through that you can get good recordings but mine totally died after a year and a half of pretty light use.
2,Save yourself the time,"Just listen to De La Soul is Dead instead. In my opinion this is the genre-gap Paul is trying to fill, but he's just technically not a sound emcee (no matter how clever people may claim he is). Seems like Paul Barman falls into the category of appealing to the type of person who likes rap but is afraid to listen to the real stuff. White UCSB kids? I don't know. If you're looking for a comedy record... i guess go for it. But if you're looking for a rap album... hm..."
2,Didn't the Beastie Boys do this 20 years ago?,"Except the Beastie Boys had Rick Rubin in their corner, so not only were they original, their tracks were bangin. Same with with Beck, 7 years ago."
1,"No brains, not funny","Obviously this guy spent a lot of time with early Beastie Boys albums, but the difference is that those guys were funny. This is just plain stupid. There's some talent in there somewhere with this guy, it is just not on display on this record."
3,So-So,"This record is ok. Paul is definitely intelligent and clever, no doubt about it. But what's up with all the press that makes him out as this Jewfro genius? As far as real Jewish rappers, I'll take Blood of Abraham, Hip Hop Hoodios, or Remedy Ross any day. This guy is too self-depricating for my own taste."
4,"A ""Paul's Botique"" for the new millenium","""Am I making a mockery of a culture like the Choco-Taco?/Am I to rap what France is to Morrocco?"" asks MC Paul Barman in ""Old Paul"". Once you hear it, you'll know -- there's no mockery here. Barman is the real deal: an MC hero for the NPR set. Where else can you go for rhymes like ""Anger!/Like Margaret Sanger!/Sitting on a bloody coat hanger!"" and ""I think about all the pube I got/while reading the Rubyat(sp?)""? He drops more names than Liz Smith, and throws down rhymes faster than the scrolling headlines outside the NYTimes building. Nerds who like their bass bumpin' are gonna find just what the need in Paullelujah."
4,fine story with some technical problems,"We enjoyed the story and the presentation of it. Romance, illusion and bold reality are bouncing off each other in this film and have a ring of familiarity, especially when they are finally connected together towards the end. BUT despite our 1st class equipment we had considerable trouble to hear the dialogs clearly. The audio appeared to be handled somewhat unprofessional, mainly in the first half of the film which added a touch of annoyance. (Of course there is the possibility that we got an impaired tape but I doubt it.) Overall a film worthy to watch."
3,"Great potential, mixed results.","This could have been a great movie. There's a lot to like about it--heartfelt story, believeable performances (Gregory Phelan is outstanding), moments of humor, and an unsentimental, matter-of-fact approach to a difficult subject. But the decision to fill the film with flashbacks & flashforwards, rather than tell the story in the sequence it happened, ruins it. It's hard to know what happens when, and I think there was a flashback within a a flashback, but I'm not sure. The story takes place over a number of years. At times, it's hard to tell what year it is. As a result, it's impossible to get involved in the story and its characters. Also, the sound quality is poor, making it even more difficult to follow. There are a number of good individual scenes, but they don't quite hang together. The director should take it back to the editing room and release a cut with a lineal time frame."
2,Tedium,"Yet another film delving into the hopelessness of gay love and AIDS, what a shallow commentary on our culture. Not every gay male eschews commitment, is a selfish ""vainiac,"" or is basically miserable. With its convoluted plot structure to boot, ""Green Plaid Shirt"" gets a rating of tedious!"
2,Toss the shirt,"Long gone are the days when we should go see a gay film simply because it is gay. with the amount of different movies lately with gay plots or subplots I've come to expect a few things. The first being a script, the second being well....a script.Seriously this film seemed to be under the impression that just putting somebody up there who has lost their lover is enough to keep us tearful and involved for the 17 hours this movie seemed to last. The fact that the sound quality was so bad I had to rewind several times to try and catch important passages was a minor annoyance compared to the complete lack of interest I was able to maintain. It is sad to say that a movie supposed to be sad and about a very serious subject had my friends and I laughing at our foolishness for renting this."
3,Bummer!!,"Don't go watching this movie with any sharp objects around you. Geez, this was a downer of a film! I am sorry maybe I should have a little more respect for the AIDS epidemic, but I really did not know that this movie was all about people dropping like flies. I guess I try to pick movies that are a little more upbeat. It was a decent movie, but just not for me.If you are into drama and death and sickness and all the lovely things that go along with it then by all means dive into this flick! You will not be disappointed."
2,Horribly awful,"Sat down last night with a friend to watch what I thought would be a heartwarming love story and ended up laughing at a plot line intended to make you cry. Every turn was predictable, except for some memory transitions that were all too confusing. I would say skip on the green plaid and go for a white shirt and good convesation."
3,So so,"""Green plaid shirt"" could have been a very good movie, but it fails on some levels.To start with - sound!!! At first I thought it was the copy I had. But after I had read other reviews I realized it's the film itself. THere were moments I could hardly understand the dialogues! Well, it didn't help to watch it at all.The story. Not bad, but the action suddenly slows down and there is too much talking. The sub-plots don't bring anything to the film, don't enhance it. Moreover, the border between past and present events is sometimes so vague, that it's really hard to make a head or tail of the plot.To sum up: it's not an optimistic film, but acting is fair good. Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed."
2,"Good intentions, but....","A friend recommended this film so I started to view it but had to stop after 30 minutes. I usually give films more of a chance but the sound quality of the DVD was so poor that I was either straining to hear what was being said or turning the volume down. (I tried it on a second DVD player with the same results.) The two main actors (Gregory Phelan and Victor Spirtas) were not too bad, but the script -- what I was able to make out of it -- left little to be desired. A bit too confusing and not conversational and realistic. The supporting characters were too clichéd and made the one scene of the introduction dinner difficult to sit through.The film's creators seemed to have made this film with good intentions: showing the effects of AIDS on the gay community by focusing on one relationship in particular. But, the script and the sound problems make it difficult to watch."
1,Finding Gold in Washington State: 2005-6 Edition,When I read the several glowing reviews on this book I wondered if we had been reading the same thing. The book is poorly organized. Maybe if it is the first and only book you read about finding gold in Washington it may answer a few questions but it is the least informative book I have found on the subject.
4,Supercar books,If you like Mopars from the musclecar era this is a wonderful book. Shows a bygone time when you could order a car with the equipment you wanted and not all of these packages you are subjected to today.
3,DECENT ADAPTATION OF A BETTER BOOK,"GONE BUT NOT FORGOTTEN is based on the best seller by Philip Margolin; another example of the book being better than the movie.However, this miniseries is effectively produced and features some good performances.Brooke Shields does okay a defense attorney who finds herself defending a corporate giant on a serious murder charge. Scott Glenn is the client who we know is guilty and has a horrifying past as well. Lou Diamond Phillips is the DA who wants to put Glenn away, and Marilu Henner is the cop from Glenn's past who tries to help Phillips.It's all familiar territory but there are enough twists and suspenseful moments to make it worthwhile viewing."
3,Not what I was expecting,"Great resource, but more information than I needed and yet not the information that I was looking for. However. it may be well suited for others looking for recyling opportunities."
5,Keep Lucy Coming!!,"I own this dvd collection and am really happy with it.I just hope that this release prompts season set releases.Please vote for ALL of Lucy's remaining shows to be released as season set dvds. We now have complete sets of I Love Lucy and The Lucy Desi Comedy Hour. We just need The Lucy Show, Here's Lucy, and Life with Lucy."
5,A TIMELESS COMEDY HIT,"Watching this brilliant comedy, it is sometimes hard to believe that all of them are gone. Watching them over and over it never gets tiring or boring. It's like watching old friends again. For me the best sit com ever,followed by the Golden Girls."
5,The writers were comic genius....,"...and the actors delivered the writer's scripts like no other cast ever could. What a group, from actors to production crew, I Love Lucy will be the standard of sitcom magic long after Y3K."
5,Some of the best tv ever made!,What more can I say. Lucy and Desi invented the situation comedy as we know it. The quality is so good it looks like it was filmed yesterday.
1,It is not what showed in the picture.,"The package is genuine, with all the canon labels, but the battery does not have the canon logo molded on the plastic. it is the same as the after market battery, which takes less than a handful picture before the camera shows ""low battery"" sign!It is NOT a true canon battery!"
3,gone fast,"I bought this Canon NB-3L Rechargeable Battery Pack for my canon sd550. For this camera model, you need the 2nd battery pack because the power was gone very fast after charging it (not more than 3 times of taking pictures...i didn't mean shutter). Unlike, canon nb-5l that I have for sd 850 IS, I can take the pictures for more than 3 or 4 events at least."
1,Defective,"At first I thought these batteries were good, but then I realized that they wouldn't hold a charge. I used them in my Canon SD 550 took a couple of pictures, then when I pulled the camera out again, a few days later, the battery would be dead. I bought two so that I would always have a charged spare but my original battery that is several years old works better still. I got stuck with paying the shipping both ways, so I am not happy."
5,Exactly what we ordered,"This is a replacement battery for our original camera battery which has died a slow death. Considering the first battery lasted about 4 years, we are hoping for the same from this one!"
3,Performs as advertised,Not much to say about this - it does exactly what it is supposed to do and does it well. Information on using the tool and SHARPENING directions would have been very helpful!
2,Will have to regrind right out of the box!,"The tool was not ground properly. The cutting edge was not perpendicular to the blade. If I try to use it before I regrind it, it will not part cleanly."
1,Great Price but...,"The price is great and it looks great but the one I received is made out of that crappy kind of Chinese steel that is so hard you can't get a good edge on it. After reading the one of the reviews here, I think I too will try the butcher knife method of a tenon tool.... The parting tools I have work much better than this. My lesson is this, you get what you pay for and I've been disappointed time and time again for going for the deal rather than buying quality merchandise."
4,The price of ignorance,"This movie once again shows that ignorance can hurt those we are trying to potrect the most. This sad story of a girl ignorance about sexual acts and their consequences are shown in this movie with insight and caring, and I think with the desired to teach our teens to be more respectful of their bodies and what their careless behavior might bring into their lives. My daughter recommends this movie with great enthusiasm."
3,"Okay, Not Great","I actually saw this in my health class this year. For a health class movie, it was pretty good, or at least a nice break from normal informational movies from the seventies (thankfully they're getting away from those now), still in my view it seems overly catastrophicist. They also didn't delve into the sex-ed programmes at the subject school, and it seemed like they shifted the entire focus of the ""epidemic"" to the students and parents.Then again, the focus on syphillis is an interesting choice, especially since with the advent of HIV/AIDS, other STDs have fallen into the background on main education, and in the case of many teens, fallen to the realm of jokes. This may prevent teens from taking this movie seriously."
2,A low budget movie -- with a pretty weak message,"I had to watch this movie in my health class, and I have to say that it did not capture real life in many senses at all. One of the things I found the most troubling about this movie was the fact that there were so many ""parties"" with unlimited weed and booze and girls and no parents, and it really doesn't work out that way most of the time in real life. Also, the director tried to make up for lack of a budget by shooting strange angles and perspectives of everyday things. No matter how you shoot it, a movie theater is still a movie theater, as far as I know. I just felt the movie was weak overall: granted it was made for TV, but just do yourself a favor and watch something that actually has some decent substance..."
5,highly recommend watching with your teen/preteen child,"with todays teens experimenting with sex at such a young age, this movie is highly recommend to show some of the risks involved in their behavior. i watched with my 12 year old and feel it left an impression on her. my coworker had watched with her daughter a few years ago and felt it left an impression also. it opens up the conversation parents should be having with their teens and preteens concerning the risks of their sexual activities."
4,Education,Great movie to share and talk about within your health class. Has a lot of key things to talk with your students.
1,Worst service ever!,"This item was supposably sent on November 25th, and it is not December 29th and I still have not gotten the item. I have contacted the seller, and they are taking 2 or more days to respond to the issue. I am to the point of disputing the charges on my credit card. I will never buy from the seller again!"
3,Hazard - Caution,"On page 28 of this book, a project calls for adding ammonia to ""liquid fabric whitener.""I am very concerned that this is not a specific enough designation for some shoppers, and they might end up using bleach product containing chlorine instead of the old-fashioned bluing that is presumably intended.There are far too many products with ""whitens"" as one of the claims on the label. Many contain chlorine. Mixing chlorine and ammonia releases a deadly gas.Anyone seeing a copy of this book in a store, library, school, or private possession should make sure that page 28 has a note added to clearly state that ***No bleach or other chlorine containing product should be used in this experiment - that is not what 'fabric whitener' means - chlorine plus ammonia can KILL***Aside from that, tho book looks nice. With the proper cautions, it may be a five star book."
4,Sound advice.....read on,"I found this book to be very helpful and fun to read but,I haven't picked it up again since my first read through. I think this would be a great gift to a new vegatarian or a lender to a person interested in learning more about the specifics. Informative and fun....just not a whole lot of new info for this long-time reader and veggie eater!"
2,Get Newer Type Tall Fescue,"It is hard to believe anyone still sells Kentucky 31 anymore on a consumer site like Amazon. It is a forage pasture grass only at this point. It produces a coarse, light green turf that only a suburban tract builder could love. It was good in the 1950s, but since then dozens of tall fescue cultivars have been developed that are better than K31 in every way -- appearance, disease resistance, germination. Just search for ""Tall Fescue"" and you will find dozens of alternatives that are no more expensive and far better in every way than this seed. Unless you are raising cattle in your backyard, buy a modern Tall Fescue. Falcon is a good one, but there are many others from name brand companies."
5,Passionate and fiery couple...,"I loved this story! Jake Reed's twin nieces, Bebe and Dede wanted a new mother and they set their sights on worldly gambler Loreli Winters.In between an impending ""pretend marriage"" just to give the twins a mother, an old lover and other complications, Jake and Loreli succumb to their attraction and true feelings for one another.Jake Reed may have been a quiet hog farmer...but he was intense and passionate enough to capture Loreli's heart. She was woman enough to subtly teach this man a few lessons and lose her heart in the process. Thank you again Beverly!"
3,What Happened Here?,"Is it just me, or does it seem like the quality in plot, characterization, and story line of Ms. Jenkins' books has been diminishing since ""Topaz"", ""Always and Foreever"" and ""Through The Storm""? After reading ""Before the Dawn"", I was throughly dissapointed and I thought that this book would more than make up for it. However, it didn't. The plot seemed underdeveloped and the book had more love scenes than it did an actual storyline. Do yourself a favor, pass this book by or, if you must read it, get a used copy, it's not worth paying full price for. What happened to the REAL Beverly Jenkins? Inquiring minds want to know!"
2,Disappointed again!,"I seem to be the odd man out as far as my opinion of this book but I just could not give this book a 3 star let alone a 5 star rating.I had high expectations for A Chance at Love. I was hoping it would be like Always and Forever but it wasn't. There is definitly something to be said for saving the best for last. This is my second book after Always and Forever and it can not compare.I liked that Loreli was smart and independent and wealthly. I also liked that she wasn't spinister virgin, a young virgin or someone who had never enjoyed sex until she met the hero of the book. However, for the life of me can't see what she saw in Jake. He was one of the most boring lack luster heros I've ever read about.In addition, the story was just boring. There was no clear plot, no major character developement and the ending was predictable.Sensuality rating 2.5 out of 5."
5,Awesome,"Ms. Jenkins does it again. I love the way she can transport you back in time and make you fall in love with the characters all at the same time. Loreli's since of self and self worth were refreshing. She wasn't ashamed of who she was or what she had, and was willing to help out where she could. And although Jake knew he wasn't the most experienced man around and didn't want to be attracted to Loreli, was willing to do anything to make his twin nieces happy and learn whatever Loreli is willing to teach him.I just fell in love with all the characters and was sad to see it end, but still loved the ending."
4,Chance at Love,"To read a book where the heroine was more experienced than the hero was a turn around. Loreli was a character I would like to read about again in a future Beverly Jenkins book because she was a strong woman in those times, but yet humble. You hate to see the ending and want to keep continuously reading about the characters. The twins were the most delightful and kept your interest as to what would be next. Ms Jenkins is one of my favorite authors and she never fails to disappoint."
4,JBentley Review,"Mr. D'Aniello's book is a very good read. It was suspensful, and had just enough plot information delivered each chapter to keep me wanting to read more. I found myself routing for the main character wanting to know the secret behind is actions. You won't want to put is down !!"
3,Misrepresented as LEATHER.,"These fit the headset just fine but it says ""leatherette"" right on the package so they are not the real thing."
3,A bit too tight,"Bought these for the Plantronics Pulsar 590A Bluetooth Headphones and they are an *extremely* tight fit! Took 3 hands and about 10 minutes to fit each side. Once they are on they look and feel fine. Just like the other reviews say, they are *not* leather but leatherette and it looks like they might disintegrate after a while. Time will tell..."
1,"This is leatherette, not leather","Maybe thy shipped the wrong item, but what I got was the same cheap leatherette ear things I already had. Whatever."
1,WAY Too Small. Not As Advertised. Beware A-Z Geek Store.,"These are tiny. If you need a pair of headphone cushions for your favorite Smurf or Fraggle or Tinkerbell, perhaps these will do. Otherwise, I have no idea why you would buy these. The product description is totally wrong. They are undersized and nothing like leather. They feel like the poorest imitation leather-like plastic. I do not recommend these. Also, the seller A-Z Geek Store is not a trustworthy seller. If you DO buy these miniature Barbie-doll-sized ear cushions, choose a different vendor. They wanted me to pay more than the item costs to return them. And after that I would have to await some sort of approval process during which they can refuse my return and keep my money. So, I let them steal the purchase price. Now I am stuck with these stupid things."
3,How do you spell Leather,Well it seems that somebody does not quite understand the difference. I paid the 9 dollars for the leather ones and received the leatherette ones that were priced at 3 dollars. I am going to request a credit and see where that goes. A tad frustrating but for the difference I thought I would spend the extra and get real leather. Yes the shipping was fine and stuff arrived in good but wrong condition.
3,Fits Plantronics Pulsar 590A Bluetooth Headset / Headphones,"Since the item didn't have the ear cushion dimension (out of the box) I rolled the dice and they actually fit my Fits Plantronics Pulsar 590A Bluetooth Headset / Headphones. YES! BTW, THE DIAMETER IS 2.5"". They aren't leather but I'm happy."
1,Does not fit Plantronics Pulsar 590,"The product's diameter is only 2"" (2 inches); it's not big enough to fit Plantronics Pulsar 590 headphones. Don't buy these if you're looking to replace your Plantronics Pulsar 590 foam ear cushions.Apart from that, the product itself is fine; as noted in other reviews, it's vinyl, not leather."
1,Be Wary - the dimensions are not even near as described!,"The quality of the ear cushions is fine ... the problem is they are not 7 inches by 4.2 inches which was the product description said. These were intended to be used as replacement cushions for a large headphone unit but the ones received are actually for small headphones so they are not at all useable. And there is no refund available, only a replacement if you send these back - so all in all a wasted purchase. The product description should be changed."
1,"Tiny, tiny pads!","Item delivered is not as advertised. Described as ""Product Dimensions: 7 x 4.2 x 0.5 inches"" Product is actually 2"" x 0.5. The bag it came in is ""7 x 4.2 x 0.5 inches "" This is a rip-off."
4,I RATE THIS EXCELLENT,"Received this product in a very timely fashion, and was very happy with it. I highly rate this seller. They did a very good job getting my product to me fast, and in very good condition! Thanks much!"
5,excellent means to exit from logic,"this buddhist logic of epistemological-logic has a built-in self-destructive logic in it. When you discover that the ordinary redkneck shares the same fate with the philosopher as far as his innate natural-logic goes, it simpely takes you to the last frontier of buddhist logic where you discover the fact that all humanbeings of all races are naturally ignorant! Unconsciously,dharmakhirti has literally outwitted the very purpose of epistemological sciences by illustrating that there is no logic beyond the logic of whatever experience you are going through!this is the kind of book who knows its diciple! it is not meant for every thinker!"
4,Buy this at Petco,"The re-sellers of this food are taking advantage of you. For, at most, $1.20 more, you can get twice as much from Petco or Petsmart. That is, 24 cans for $2 more then the the 12 can + ship price from these sellers."
3,Interesting but...............,"Although the information is accurate up to a point, the documentarian utilized a most annoying format, after a few minutes of watching pictures fade in and out I was ready to give up on the film. Then it seemed to start again and became and interesting look at what happened to Holland during the occupation. However, it paints a bit to rosy a picture of resistance. Few Dutch resisted. There was for the most part passive collaboration and all to often active collaboration. Only a handful of Dutch Jews survived and Holland had its own transport camps were Jews waited to be shipped east, held captive by fellow Dutch men and women. It would be a better movie if in fact the documentarian had set aside the ""artistic"" rendering in favor of a look at what is a complicated, painful history."
2,"Kind of spacey, unintelligible, and overly artsy...","... the end result being a film that's not particularly erotic or even interesting. Basically there's no story here, just a vignette of scenes edited together with little rhyme or reason. I suppose the directors/writers/producers wanted something critics would be afraid to bash for fear of sounding unappreciative of the higher arts, so we're left this this boring hash that nobody will ever bother watching a second time."
3,Lots of Kissing...,"If you like a lot of kissing (which most of us girls do) you'll like this dreamy depiction of youthful lust. It's a short (35 mins.?) no talking fantasy that takes you at different rhythms thru various settings, building to a rather unsatisfying ending...but it can be fun along the way."
1,"Cheap, fake, boring, unimaginative, a complete TURNOFF.","This goes into the WASTE OF TIME vault. Here's what I don't get: if you want to make something that is ACTUALLY HOT, get REAL lesbians and film them really doing it. Sex and lame acting DO NOT make anything hot, no matter what they actually do, especially when you're talking about women having sex together. Skip this garbage...SEXY love scenes: Bound, Fingersmith, Desert Hearts, Loving Annabelle, Tipping the Velvet, Better Than Chocolate, Portrait of a Marriage to name a few. WOW, and imagine this, they are actually great movies with quality acting and a PLOT."
4,Sensual,"My girlfriend and I found this video very stimualting! In fact we wished our VCR had a repeat button, since we used it as mood enhancing material!"
2,Not for building to building communication,We have 2 buildings across the street from each other (one a 5 story and one a 15 story) and we have to be near the window closest to the other building in order to get a clear communication.
1,Battery Problems and Poor Service,"The Freetalk FRS handsets I purchased seem to work fine (range was OK and voice was clear). However, after time I detected a design flaw that is most frustrating - the batterries drain fairly rapidly when the unit is turned off. The resistance across the batteries terminals when the unit is allegedly off lends to frustration when you reach for the radios in times of need. I sent the service center a request for help that has gone unanswered. Poor service and poor battery performance means - Don't buy these."
5,Does the job,I wanted this to change the position of my wireless mouse dongle that sticks out of my laptop. This little thing allows you to bend the mouse dongle up out of the way to avoid breaking it and position it for best mouse reception.
4,It works,"I bought 2 of these and they do what they are intended to do: enable the re-positioning of USB drives. They offer a very wide range of re-positioning positions. I use mine for positioning a USB flash drive plugged into my car radio so it isn't accidentally broken off. I use the other in the same way on my laptop for the drive for my wireless mouse. They aren't all that sturdy but they probably shouldn't be: In the worse case scenario, these will break instead of the USB drives."
4,nice gadget,"Nice gadget. I ordered one, one was bad. With a cable tester I found out that pin 1 was not connected.I got refund right away. For the handy man, you can clip it open and solder the wire on. For me no big deal, for average user not possible.But it works great."
5,Laptop space saver,"I use these on my laptop which is mounted under a table on a pull out drawer. The laptop is wider than most and I found that plugging the usb connector into the side of the laptop created a problem when closing the laptop. The Flex USB extension solved the problem beautifully! The Flex is truly flexible, it can be adjusted easily in every possible position that could be required for successful use. I looks well made and I have no worries about it's use on my laptop. Great product, perfect solution.IDE DIST FL001 Flex USB"
2,"OK but a 2"" cable might be better.","It works as described but it's not a solution because it sticks out and risks snagging. A 2"" cable would be better if it was streamlined so it wouldn't snag as readily as this does. USB makes more sense at back of laptop than at side."
3,FlexUSB,"The design of the FL001 FlexUSB USB adapter is similar to the one done by Cables to Go although it does not seem as well made. The detents for the orientation adjustment do not have a true ""click"". It does however function adequately."
3,"ANDRE DE TOTH, OPUS 23","***1/2. Often described as a good Randolph Scott B movie, The Bounty Hunter deserves a lot more recognition. The motivations of the De Toth's hero are, as always, morally debatable here. Memorable scenes include the questioning of a bad guy forced to sit on a stove, a few 3D effects and the study (thoughts on McCarthy's period ?) of the behaviour of people under stress. Recommended."
2,Amateurish and unfocused,"After searching for books on storyboarding for a class, I found and read a handful of them. This book was a big disappointment. For readers looking to learn about the CRAFT of storyboarding, I strongly recommend ""From Word to Image"" by Begleiter. However, if you like personal anecdotes, personal preferences, Hollywood history trivia, uninspiring graphics, and little teaching content, then Mr. Hart's ""Art of Storyboard"" will give you much of that. I am giving it two stars instead of one, because there are few books on storyboarding and because there is nonetheless some useful content (but it could have been put in 10 pages)."
1,Profoundly dissapointing,"Siggraph San Antonio was about to close up shop on its last day and I finally made my way to the bookstore. I had about 7 minutes to make my choices. One choice was a nicely done book on character animation in Flash, and the other was ""The Art of the Storyboard"" by John Hart Hart's book is one that I can truly say I regret buying. There is little of use inside, and some severely misleading bits as well. (For instance Hart tells us that it's the storyboard artist who determines light placement.) I was hoping for a book that would give me some information on generally used techniques for depicting camera moves, fades and other conventions. Instead we get pencil drawings cribbed from films that look more like fan-art than any storyboards I've ever seen or worked with.Anyone wanting insights into how tho convey their cinematic vision to others would do well to steer clear of this volume."
5,A fine period instrument performance,"There are many different interpretations of Mozart's youthfull violin concertos, and I can't claim to have heard more than 5 or 6 of them, but I find this performance very satisfying. The old Grumiaux recording with the London Symphony is often cited as the best, but I don't like the big orchestra sound, especially in an old recording, I much prefer the more open sound of the Orchestra of the 18th century. And I think Monica Huggett's playing on a violin of the period near perfect. A crititism ? The cover notes are a bit skimpy, but so is the price !"
2,Taut but Uninteresting Performances,"Mozart's violin concertos are the products of a young composer. A lot of their magic is created by the performers. In this set, you have a well-recorded and well-played reading by the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment. With Monica Huggett you get a fine soloist who is more known for her Baroque work. The result is a set of well-crafted but ultimately boring performances. Since Mozart did not designate specific cadenzas to be played, every soloist can play what they like, Huggett choosing to perform her own. They are really a major disappointment, revealing a performer who really doesn't have a lot to say about these staples of the repertoire, like the performances as a whole. These concertos are good period performances but say nothing. Skip them, especially in a crowded field."
3,Sneaks up on you,"Draws you into its web of intrigue, delusion, and betrayal and sneaks up on you with a shocker ending. Quirky, interesting performances. Non-trendy, Hitchock-style camerawork. Not what it seems at first, but stick with it. I liked this movie!"
5,What love is really about,"A journey taken by the central character.. obsessed.. Zahir..for her beloved wife whom she lost for the reasons unknown to him.. In this journey he meets characters like Mikhail,Dos.. people who make him know about what love is really about..People who let his wife know the truth.. Liberate them from their personal history..telling them love should manifest itself freely and untrammeled, guiding us with force and driving us on..not expecting the way you love other the pther person is going to love you the same.. a understanding of nature of love, power of destiny and what it means to follow your heart..Worth reading.."
2,Boring!,"I like the author, I like his style and wisdom, but this book was a pain to go through at some places, repetition, repetition, same ideas over and over...and the story is not coherent, at least to me, but still you have the traces of his wisdom and appealing style..."
4,Muy esperanzador,"Muy bueno a mi parecer, cuando lo empece no lo pude dejar, finalmente me animo a ver las cosas de otra manera en especial en este momento donde mi vida necesita respuestas y me encanto eso de reencontrarse a uno mismo, y aunque las cosas no terminen como uno quiere, aprendemos que la vida es mucho mas que eso, y es un viaje interminable."
4,el zahir,"un exito mas del gran escritor paulo coelho, es un libro que te motiva llegar al final,te entusiasma y no quieres parar de leer,un libro que sin lugar a dudas nos impacta a todas las mujeres en especial,al darnos cuenta de que en algun momento dado hemos sido un zahir,al menos en mi caso personal"
1,Perdida de tiempo,"Sinceramente no me gusto este libro, me parecio tan aburrido y tedioso .. Lo termine porque ya lo habia comprado .... la historia de un hombre obsesionado la encontre muy monotona y un poco absurda..."
1,bias at it's best,"Juan Hernandez is slick and writes well... While he may be knowledgable about the issues his view is biased. He can't see past race long enough to realized that this isn't about race. It is about national security, economics, enforcing our laws and reinforcing our sovreignty. So Juan... tell us again how we only have to follow the laws we agree with... and one more time to help me understand how that makes us a better country?"
1,not worth the money,This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. It was not well thought out or researched at all. A am an American of Mexican decent so I read it with with a very open mind. Senor Hernandez is in la-la land. He does not have a clue. Nothing he says makes a lick of sense.
4,Summary of content,"(I haven't seen this yet, since it hasn't been released as of when I'm writing this. I just thought I'd put a summary of the content of this dvd here, so you don't have to search the web for it.)Features:- 9 fun-filled episodes- 2 sing-along songs- 4 DVD games- Read-along story & more!Story Stops:- Snow- Thomas's Christmas Party- Thomas & the Missing Christmas Tree- Terence the Tractor- Thomas & Percy's Mountain Adventure- Special Funnel- It's Only Snow- Jack Frost- Toby Had a Little LambSing-Along Songs- The Snow Song- Winter Wonderland"

4,Another success,"Bought this for my daughter, who is a big Glee-fan.She has seen all episodes already and will be seeing them again."
5,Excellent.,My daughter has turned me into a gleek. It's something we can watch together and discuss since some of the topics are a bit over a level of a 13yr old.
1,skip it and reread Fire's Stone,"Tanya Huff has been one of my favorite writers -- someone I read without ever needing to look at a review first, but this time I really wish I had. The characters are hackneyed and unchanging (there's more development in a Harlequin). Where is the nuanced self-discovery and growing understanding of the world that are a trademark of Huff's other books? I was sorely disappointed and hope that if in fact this book is the start of a new series, her characters do some growing up."
3,Somewhat Slow,"This book was a good time filler when there was nothing else to do. I thought after reading the reviews that I would love this book, but found that I had a hard time getting into it. I did not find the cat all that witty, the ghost was irritating and Claire, the main character in charge of closing the pit to hell in the basement was not very likeable. I did not feel that the characters had much depth.The sister Diana was the most interesting and lovable character in the book, unfortunately, it was not Diana's story.The attempt to weave romance in was not very good. I was surprised to find out the characters finally had a night together since I felt that their was no chemistry.It is good it you want to read something with a different storyline, but don't look for endearing characters or great chemistry.It is a good book when their is nothing else to do, but I would not stop what I was doing to read it."
5,Wonderful,"Tanya Huff is one of my most loved authors. I have read everything of hers, minus the quarter books, and have debated on them.She writes with humor and style. Fast paced, but allowing you to keep up with the story. She does not dewll on a single aspect of humanity, but tosses in everyday aspects of life and how they effect having to save the world.The charaters are fun and likeable. They have their quirks and negitives, but they get the job done, and just becasue they have special powers dosen't mean they can do everything alone, which is great."
5,My 1st Huff Book and I Want More!,I love the idea of a 'keeper' living among us ordinary mortals and keeping evil at bay. The talking cat is icing on the cake. The story kept me interested from beginning to end. I plan to buy more Huff books this very week.
5,"This is an intriquing, witty and clever book.","You have to love a book that has a talking cat. What a delight, cover to cover. I hope this becomes a series like the ""Blood"" books. Anytime you can thrill and chuckle both is a treat."
2,Pass on this one...,"I was hoping for a whole lot more depth when I read Summon the Keeper. The characters are barely developed. Claire, the main character is bitchy, arrogant, and plain unlikeable. Perhaps more character development would have led to some (minor) ability to relate to her, but it just never got there.Reading other reviews has led me to believe that perhaps some of it is meant to be funny... I guess I don't get it."
5,still laughing...,"This book actually scared me, because it sounded so much like something I would write. Except, of course, much, much better. I gave it to my sister to read, and she agreed with that. Also, the cat reminds me of my own black and white cat. Does this book actually exist, or am I having delusions? Anyone who can read this book and not laugh out loud must be dead."
5,Great Read!,"Very funny, very charming, excellent start to a splendid series. Full of warmth, humor, and sparkling imagination. Definitely a ""keeper""!"
3,Don't give up too soon ..,"If you feel at all inclined to give up on this book at first, be forewarned, ""Summon The Keeper"" starts slowly, and it feels early on that nothing much is happening, but hang in there to around about page 90 at least, because with the introduction of the character Jacques, things get a lot more interesting and build nicely from there."
4,"I initially bought the book for the kitty, but wound up liking it a lot.","Okay, you should NEVER judge a book by its cover, right? The goofy title was a bit of a turn off but there was this kitty...well, the kitty in the book looked a lot like my kitty from childhood and I had some time to kill so why not? I wound up loving this book. I love the characters. I love the idea of the Keepers. I love the family dynamics. I love that the Keepers don't drive. I love the banter.If you're looking for some well-written, charming, escapist fantasy, this is a perfect book. Read it on the beach. Read it in the airport. I don't recommend trying to pull this one over on your Literature teacher though, she may get cranky.I've read the three books in the series and they're scads of fun. I can't seem to locate a fourth one so I'm assuming that its in the works, or at least I hope so."
3,An OK read,Summon the Keeper is an OK read. I truly did not think that the book was anything extraordinary. Clare Hansen is a great character but very one dimensional. She never quite develops in this book.I would say pick it up as a good summer afternoon read but don't expect it to carry you through until the evening.
5,Lighthearted fun,"There is no way you can read this book without having a good time. The characters including the cat, are all precious and will keep you giggling throughout. Be sure to also get the sequel. You want to read them back to back."
5,Hilarious,"I could not put the book down, it was the greatest from the greatest cat alive(after of course my own precious cat, Myles) Austin to Hell. Read and devour it. I could not stop laughing. I read it somewhere that there will be ANOTHER BOOK out called THE SECOND SUMMONING..hopefully i am not wrong."
5,An enjoyable read,"Tanya Huff is one of my favorite authors and *Summon the Keeper* is a good example why. A keeper is someone who repairs holes in the fabric of the universe and basically saves the world from being overrun by evil.Claire, the keeper, winds up in a rundown guest house with a hellhole in the basement, a resident lusty ghost, a caretaker/cook to die for, and several interesting and unusual guests. I especially enjoyed the retired Olympians.This is funnier than her blood series and I stayed up until three in the morning to finish it! I highly recommend this book, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed that it will become a series."
5,An excellent blend of reality and the metaphysical!!,"Huff provides the reader with a pleasant escape to a possible reality in Summon the Keeper. Although I intially had trouble connecting with Claire, I hated to close the cover when finished. her interactions with the other characters - expecially Austin and Mrs. Abrams (with a ""b"" and two esses) had me laughing out loud. Fans of Laurell K. Hamilton (like myslef) will truly enjoy this book as it also offers a blend of reality and the metaphysical with a good dose of humor tossed in. I can only hope that Ms. Huff won't leave us hanging by publishing many more of Claire's, Austin's and Dean's adventures. But, since evil can never be truly vanquished, maybe we won't have long to wait. A Keeper's work is never done!"
3,Huff at her best,"I've read all of Huff's work-some of it is definitely better than others-and this is one of her best. The story flows fun and easy. Huff's strength for me is writing strong female leads with even stronger faults and great senses of humor. I really enjoyed this escapist caper. And loved the clever ""insider jokes"" about other books and myths woven into the dialogue. Anyone else see Narnia in the Wardrobe?"
4,A great book if you REALLY love movies,This book is great for people who wanna learn more a bout what a director does and what they go through. the book is well laid out. each page is dedicated to a certain director or sets of directors (Joel and Ethan coen have their own page together) all in all a very well done book.
1,You must be kidding,"The trouble with most movie books is they're written by people with, at best, questionable credentials. Most of them are written by university film department drop-outs - disenchanted Humanities majors who spent too much time in the rear stalls of some of the seedier art houses. But, if Roger Ebert can make a living at it (and win a Pulitzer Prize for it), then anyone can. Why not you?"
3,A Picture Saves a Thousand Words,"When I got this book, I was disappointed in the lack of text. I would have preferred less directors and more exposition. Still, I come back to it time and again for the beautiful photographs. For that reason, I would have give in four stars but for one fatal defect. THIS BOOK IS FULL OF SPOILERS! IMO, it is a crime to give away the ending of a movie like ""The Bicycle Thief"" to name only the most egregious example. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."
1,Un-informative,"The book is not good. It claims to be about the ""Director's Vision"", but each exposition is mostly made up the authors personal feelings about one film of each director. Hardly any information is given about the directors themselves, aside from one or two brief sentances at the very end of the paragraph. The movie stills, which are of extremely poor quality, take up half the page. In addition, no index had been made. The directors are listed alphabetically but if you want to find a certain movie or genre you have to skim each page individualy. The book is a failure and currently in my bathroom."
4,Original premise with excellent observations,"This book would be ideal for a college film class, as it discusses the merits of many famous directors as well as some you may not have known were so significant. The brief, one-page descriptions get to the heart of each director's significance. One still from each director's work exemplifies the point the author is making.These descriptions made me want to seek out films by the directors. I am very interested in researching some of the lesser known ones in the book, based on the author's observations. This book looks at film as an art form and gives a glimpse at each director's personal style and contribution to the art form.However, if you are looking for an in-depth study or a pop-culture overview, the brevity may leave you wanting. What you won't get is a complete survey of their careers, or lots of sensational stories. Those are best left to tell-tale bios and tabloids. This book is strictly about the art and artists. Highly recommended."
3,OK............But!,I installed the Avic D3 without any major problems. The only major flaw I have found is the parking break safety. The unit must see the parking break on before it allows you access to any menu options on the Navigation option screen. Only problem is if you don't use your parking break before you start your car a red warning message comes on the screen after the unit powers up. This is a stupid setup and Pioneer wants me to remove the unit and send it back to the factory for a software update. No way am I going to take the whole thing apart to send it back. So now if I forget the lock the parking break before I start the car I have to reset this warning message. This is a poor design!
2,"Lousy Vendor , Lousy product",Product looks is not even covered by pioneer warranty . serial number was scrtached (the installer showed me).product is lousy .. user interface is non intuitive ..
3,Great,"Great product, but I give Pioneer a big FAIL with updating this product. It seems like they just used this product as a filler between two major releases. If the software on this unit was updated, this would be a GGRREEAATT buy!"
2,Terrible Navigation,"The navigation on this unit is absolutely horrible. Its not that it doesn't do it the most efficient way, but it just doesn't make ANY SENSE at all. Just as someone else posted, it will have you drive right past the road you should turn on, then make a u-turn a few miles away, and come right back to where you should've turned to begin with. If that's not bad enough, its even had me turn off the correct road that i was already on, drive a few miles, make a u-turn, and come right back to the same exact intersection. There's just no explanation for this thing, unless it's that it's a big prank from Pioneer."
2,Always lost,"I rate the radio 5 star. Ipod interface 5 star. xm interface 5star. Now for the Nav system if I could give it a -5 stars I would. I have used them all in rent a cars and own an old garmin that works great. The D-3 has a habit of routing you pass were you should turn and than will have you u turn and back track up to 3 or 4 mile to turn on the street you passed 5 miles ago. It is 4 house off to find my house, the old Garmin is 4 feet off. For Navagation forget this one."
4,Very nice use of medieval period instruments,"Very nice selection of medieval music and use of period instruments. Thoughtful, imaginative, often enchanting choices/collection.Oriental influences. Even the organ/horn music manages to be interesting. Uses viols/violin, stringed instruments, hurdy gurdy, horns.Mostly very enjoyable to listen to. Four stars rating.Ken Cybulska"
2,Movie was great not the book,The movie is based loosely on the book. I usually read the book before the movie but in this case I saw the movie first. I was very disappointed when I read the book. Definitely not worth buying
3,Love??,"Chose to read the book before watching the movie, I think I was looking more for a story than actually his events in life. I kind of felt like he was bragging about his accomplishments and jobs. It just seemed to get repetitive once the story was told. Still had a good message of hope and love, but as a young divorcee, I'm not really believing in that kind of love. Glad to know it exist for someone."
4,Excellent,This was an excellent book. Some people do take their vows seriously. Love lasts forever if you work at it!
4,Short book but worth it,"After seeing the movie I was intrigued by the true inspiration behind it. While the book does not go into great depth of all the details, it does answer the underlying questions as to why their vows were so important to them. Would be a great book for a discussion group!"
5,The Vow,"Twe saw the movie and decided to get the book. The book was much better than the movie. We also saw a report with the real characters that the book was based on. According to them, the book was much closer to the real story."
2,religious propaganda,"the actual event is interesting and would have made a good story, but the book was not about the even it was about their all encompassing relationship with jesus. the entire book is really about how they love christ and christianity. i wouldn't have minded, if it was just the background to how they got through such a horrible experience, but it was the entire story. so if you are not a christian or don't want to be bombarded with how great christianity is then DO NOT read this book. it made the book boring and tedious."
1,Not for me,"I thought this book would be a good read but it definatly wasn't for me. I thought it would be like the movie with alot of romance and that wasn't the case. However, I'd you are a Christian this book is for you because it's based on the couples spiritual journey."
2,A Waste of Time and Money!,"After seeing the movie I was chomping at the bit to read the real story. I shouldn't have wasted the time and money for this book. It was poorly written. This book could've been simplified in a magazine or newspaper article. I wish I would've searched for those first. It had too much religious connotation in it. I respect that these people had a strong faith, but to read about it in every other paragraph was just ridiculous! Lastly, it was very repetitive.This is the one and only time I would recommend seeing the movie and not reading the book, but keep in mind Hollywood did change the story a little."
2,The Vow,"I know it's a true story, I know the woman who lived through this. I believe it made Kim sound like this wonderful man who gave everything up to care for his wife but in reality it is what we sign up for when we say till death do us part. So the book should not be based so much on his devotion, but more on The miracle of Crickets healing and how extremely and abundantly blessed they are to have two children on of whom also suffered from brain trauma. I think it was a book all about Kim. It was ok."
1,The Vow,"The book sounded quite good ,reading the book it got into the story quickly. I would recemend this book to my friends"
5,Love it,I ordered this movie at the suggestion of a friend. This was a great movie. I enjoyed it very much.
4,Great story- easy read!,"A newlywed myself, I bought this as an ""airplane book"" after seeing the Carpenter's story on ""Today"" and ""Dateline."" Not only is the story inspiring, it's also very easy to read. (I'm not the fastest reader in the world, but finished this book in 3 short sittings over a weekend!--it never made it to the plane)In a day when the ""D"" word is an ""easy out"" this is a great example of how two people put their faith in God and each other to keep a promise."
1,Disappointed,"This was a very poorly written book. The story is amazing, but the writer could have written it more intelligently. He comes off as a hero who puts up with a crazy woman, when she can't help that part of her has been unwillingly altered. I felt like I was reading it from a 10 year old's perspective. I was thoroughly disappointed."
3,"I'm glad he married a virgin, but did she?","Has anyone else noticed that he didn't address this? The double standard lives on, IMHO. One star deducted for this.Otherwise, it's a beautiful story of love that triumphed over enormous adversity, and yes, they are still married. A movie is in the works and the Carpenters now have two children: Danny, born around the time the book was released, and Lee Ann, born in 2003.Even if you leave the religious aspect out of it, they stayed together for one reason: They wanted to."
1,religious,A nice story written more journal than book like. Mostly just religious propaganda. I expected more of the story on how the rekindled their marriage but got a lesson in faith.
2,Boring,Uninspired and poorly written. To be honest I think this is due in part to the fact that book could have been much shorter. I was left with the feeling that this had less to do with the 'true life' aspect than with the fact that real people have to deal with difficult situations all the time. The writers seem to feel that writing about the role god played int their lives would inspire the reader but it was mentioned so often it made it seem trite and ended up demeaning the god they seem to be so fond of.
1,"Although an unfortunate story, not at all like the movie.","I feel this book was definitely an inspirational story Christian wise, but those looking to read this book as a ""Love story"", to show how love and romance conquers all...will be a bit disappointed. They're journey through this hardship seemed not very romantic and loving to say the least, but more directed thanks will, and prevalence to God. As stated in this book, this was a story (not so much about Love) but to show the glory and power of God."
5,Such a touching book,"This book is so wonderfully writen by the people who lived through this tragedy. This book tells of the had times Kim Carpentar went through as she dealt with the recovery of her husband, Kricket. There life was changed forever when a truck collided with their small vehicle and almost killed them. Kricket was in a coma for a while and when he awoke, he had no memory of his wife Kim. This is their true story of how she coped and how the fell in love all over again. I just finished this book and I'm so glad I read it. It was truly inspirational."
4,Simple and sweet,"Two months after their wedding Kim and Krickett are in a horrible car accident. Both survive, but Krickett can't remember her husband at all. Her memory is completely erased for the entire time they knew each other. So Kim begins the daunting task of not only helping Krickett heal, but also helping her fall in love with him again.The authors decided to write the book themselves so that they could ensure that all of the details were correct. I have not watched the movie yet so was able to read the book without any other pictures or scenes in mind. It was very simple and straightforward writing, but it definitely got across the story and message they intended. I enjoyed it and look forward to watching the movie."
4,Heartfelt and Truely inspiring,"I had read an excerpt from this book so I had a taste of what this book was about. But wow! The true, deep love and devotion this man had to his wife! Their true faith in God and the way they didn't turn their back on him or each other! Amazing! It really touched my heart and my faith. This is what true love, marriage, and faith in God is about. This is how it is suppose to be. Unfortunately, most of our world has forgotten this. I pray that one day people will rediscover the real meaning behind true love, true marriage, and honest, steadfast faith. I believe once our world discovers these things again, if they ever do, our world will begin to come back together like it should be. Of course not without conflict, differences, and war, but there will be more togetherness as nations and as a people. The only reason it's missing that last star is because I wanted more! :)"
5,great,"great book for anyone who loves the movie, this isnt the true life story but it does tell of them on the back"
3,The Vow,Not as good as I thought it was going to be but still a great Christian story of faith and love in our Lord.
5,The Vow,"A great read. I would reccommend this book to anyone who is thinking of getting married. The commitment to each other, especially the husband is what I would call a real marriage and the reason for marriage. Give as a gift to someone newly engaged or just married. It would also be great as a bible study book review. Dont expect it to be like the movie the real thing is soooo different and much better. The movie is terrible in comparision."
3,Inspiring story but too many details,This is truly an inspiring story but I think I would perfer the movie. It seemed to get too bogged down in describing all the emotions and medical jargoon.
5,Awesome Book,What a awesome book! i couldn't put it down once I started reading it. I would recommend this book to all readers and even non readers. Hope you enjoy the book as much as i did.
4,An inspirational story.,An honest look at amnesia and the devastating effects it can have on even the strongest relationship. It is an inspirational story of how love can endure through harsh times if Faith is the foundation. Kim Carpenter's story about the highs as well as the lows is real and honest. He is not pious yet one is left with a a comforting sense of how the Christian faith sustains in the most awful circumstances.
3,Wow,Such a great testimony. The only things I was disappointed with were having the pictures in the middle of the book and depth of feeling. The pictures took away any suspense that the reader had. It told the rest of the story before you actually had the chance to read it. And what I mean by depth of feeling is the author gave facts of the events and told some of what was going on inside him and his wife but I feel it was more surface feelings. I couldn't get lost in the characters and their world. It felt more like what a news channel would provide than an author. But still a great story. In today's world we need to see and read more about couples taking their vows seriously.
5,Amazing,What an awesome book! I'm only thirteen and I loved it. I'm gonna watch the movie now .This is one of my favorite books.
4,The Vow,"The book was very good, not really like the movie, but some similarities. I personally liked the book more than the movie."
4,Amazing Couple!,Great true story of how God worked through this difficult situation. I had the privilege to interview Kim and Krickitt and they seem like such wonderful people! What a blessing for them to be able to share their story with the world through this wonderful book.
4,Wow!,This for sure is an inspirational story. Very easy to follow and just long enough to comprehend the true meaning the author is trying to deliver.....Amazing story.
5,Heartbreaking Story,"This book made me cry tears of happiness then sadness and then happiness again. If this couple can overcome a big obstacle, anyone can overcome little ones."
4,The Vow,"I found this book to be heartwarming, inspiring and altogether a ""good read"".A little sad at first but definitely worth the time. It's a feel good story abouthow true love should be.It is a book you won't soon forget and the photos make it seem so much more personal..Read it , you won't be sorry !"
4,Inspiring faith and love!,The movie is hardly like the book. Really enjoyed this book. The story of faith and keeping a vow is very inspiring!
5,So much more than I thought,"This book was so much more than I thought it would be. It is such a romatic story but so much more. It shows the faith in God these two people have and it is such a wonderfu story of love,faith and sprite. It was so inspiring that you want to stand up and cheer while you are reading the book. It was so well written and the love is so much you cry,laugh and your heart aches for them all the way through the book.... God blesses them the whole way through."
4,Don't Judge The Book By The Movie,"I had expected the book to be somewhat like the movie. Wrong. I did not like the movie much, but the book was beautiful. It was real, and spell binding. I did not want to put it down. Read it. I'm sure glad I did!"
5,Inspiring,"As usual, the book is much better than the movie. I cannot imagine going through what these two did and remaining married. Seeing their faith tried and strengthened through all of this was inspiring."
3,wanting more,"It was very good but sort of just left you wanting more.It left a lot of questions still unanswered.He went into detail about the injurys, but didn't explain a lot about the second courtship."
1,this actually is a book called Protein Power,This book is about protein it has all types of recipes in it i was totally expecting something else far different from this i think i have the wrong book
3,Just my view,"I thought the book was inspirational and depicted an unfailing faith that God would, and did, bring them through some unbelievably difficult times.I enjoyed the book, but thought it moved too slow in some places."
3,The Vow,Very SHORT book..It's ok if you like a quick read. I heard the movie was better. Not worth the money.
1,The Vow - I'd rather watch the movie thanks.,"I purchased this book after watching and enjoying the movie. Now generally I will swear black and blue that the book is ALWAYS better. Unfortunately in this case, it wasn't to be.I started reading with high hopes. It must be an okay book if they made a movie of it right? WRONG.In short, I couldn't get past the first chapter. This does not happen often to me - I will read pretty much everything and anything.I can see why the basic story would have inspired a movie, and I can see why the screen writers, directors and producers took a basic premise and varied it largely to appeal to a much wider audience.I would not recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed the movie. The basic plot is the same but the journey to get there is vastly different.I would recommend this book to someone who likes reading non fiction with deeply religious over tones. I assume they carried on through the whole story."
2,Can't believe movie was better,"I guess the movie producers were concerned with all the references to God, so they changed the story completely. What they didn't realize was they made the story better."
3,Mommy.Dizzle,"It was an ok book. I am not sure what I was expecting, but I would have liked more from it. Being a ""true events"" story..I guess they couldn't have given me anymore than they did!"
2,"nice story, but boring read","I can appreciate the great story that they are trying to share but found myself waiting for ""the good part"". While I know that the religious angle is important to the writer, I found it to be overwhelming. This should be classified as a Christian book."
5,awsome read,This is by far the best book I have read in a very long time. Definately woth the money. Definately going to tell all my friends to get it too.
1,Read the book first.,I made the mistake of watching the movie first. Now I can't seem to get myself to read the book cause I find it too boring. I'm sure I'll eventually get to it one day.
2,This book wasn't for me.,"The storyline was amazing and a beautiful. However, there was a lot of repetition. It was the same words over and over. I ended having to skim over some of the chapters just to get through it. I was a lil disappointed."
3,Not too Shabby,The book was really good. The pictures were awesome to see. Helps you see it clearer. I wish I could have heard more of Krickitt's view point . . . it'd probably help understand what she was going through more.
5,The Vow,This book makes interesting reading. I read it in two sittings. It seems impossible to keep one's vow under such circumstances in real life. Yet this is real life and that really makes it all the more amazing. With God the impossible becomes possible.
2,:-/,"Very interesting in the beginning, because the book is very different from movie. I don't usually say or think this but the movie was so much better then the book. To many dry sports in the book."
1,disappointed,"I was drawn to this true story, but found it to be sugar sweet and overdone. Monotonous to read. A short book, yet a long read."
4,"Kindle ""The Vow"" book review",Excellent book. Quick read. Very inspiring. I haven't got to see the movie yet but talking to a friend the movie doesn't not have as much of the reference to their commitment and believe to GOD as the book tells of. But I do look forward to seeing and comparing to the movie. I highly recommned the book.
4,Moving Story,I found The Vow a good read and most thought provoking. What strength it takes to believe when things go so very wrong. A tragic accident followed by amazing faith.The Vow: The True Events that Inspired the Movie
5,The Vow,"I suppose every woman would love to have a husband who is prepared to stick to his marriage vows like this gentleman did. His steadfastness, faith in God and love for his wife is staggering."
4,Good read,Would recommend this book to a friend. Cant wait to see the movie and compare. This book is very touching.
1,Ok,The movie was a lot better! I was disappointed by this book. Wish it wasn't so drown our. Oh well
4,Reading the story before watching the movie.,"Writing is kind of flat and melodramatic, but the subject matter is very fascinating!A good story of hope and courage."
2,Disappointed Vow,I expected so much more from this book. The previews to the movie look wonderful and I wanted to read the book before I saw it. I did not expect such a religious book. I am by no means a non religious person but that was just too much. My book club at work had decided to read this and all of us feel the same way.
3,The Vow,I should imagine the movie will be more inspiring than the book which I found somewhat long winded and repetitive.
3,Loved it til the end.,"Being a Christian I really appreciated the spirituality of the book. However, I felt the ending was just TOO full of the worldly aspects of fame, money, travel and ""the good life."" That could have been shortened by alot. Too much time was spent on all the publications (repeated over and over) and the TV appearances. But overall, it was a good book and I am most anxious to see the movie as I heard that it is quite different."
3,The Vow,"This book was not as good as I thought it would be. Although it was authored by both Krickett and Kim, it was too much about him. I was expecting more about how Krickett dealt with her rehab and loss of memory and the falling in love again. It seemed to be all about him. Was a disappointment."
5,Fascinating story,"I have heard about the movie but have not seen it. I figured it was another sappy romance but then I discovered that it's based on a true story. When I found out that there was a book I downloaded it to my Kindle. This book is a quick read,I finished it in two days. It's also a light read, meaning that it's more of a journal of Kim Carpenter's point of view. It's not flowery or very romantic or sappy in any way. It's almost like he was sitting across from me telling me their story. This book is also written by Christians who are deeply in love with God and want to give Him the glory for what He did in their lives.I doubt this book would ever earn any prestigious literary awards but it was inspiring none the less."
5,The Vow,I loved this book! I could not put it down and read it in one day. What a wonderful story of an amazing couple!
1,Very poorly written don't waste your time,"Though the story was sweet in its own way, it was essentially an elongated newspaper article. It was poorly written and told very little of a story."
2,Too religious for me,"The story of the Carpenters is incredible but I must admit it was way too religious to me. I am not sure if I still want to see the movie anymore. I actually wanted to save the book for a vacation but I am glad I didn't. Does not qualify for me for a good page turner on or for vacation. Don't get me wrong, I feel bad for them what they had to go through and I applaud them for sticking together and making it work again but it was just way too religious reading for me."
2,The vow,This book was heartfelt and marriage is a big commitment .Looking forward to seeing the movie soon can't wait.
2,Idk about it,It was good until the middle of the book then i just lost interest in it...not my cup of tea sorry...
2,The Vow,"Very disappointed.. I read the book that was a beautiful love story and a story of Gods love for us and how he doesn't leave us in adversity and trouble.. they changed the movie to me almost 90%. I didn't even recognize it from the book.If you read the book, do not see the movie."
5,Good Movie,"Good Movie, and I am looking forward to reading the book. I know KIm personally since he and his twin brother grew up living one street over from our family and played with our children. My husband retired shortly after the accident, and we moved away, so I am glad everything is well with them. I knew about the book, etc but was really shocked that they had his parents as deceased in the movie. But as we all know, the movies have to be dramatic.Virginia L."
4,Very good and inspiring,Well this book made me look at life differently and I really enjoy how the couple over came their challenges
1,The Vpw,Excellent book on faith and true love. I wish this kind of love for my daughter and granddaughter.Would recommend to anyone at any age.
2,"Good, but not what I expected",The story is true and real; it makes you think and wonder what you would do in such a situation. I wasn't a fan of the constant attention to religion and the authors push for the reader to find their faith!
4,the vow,this book is really a good read. I just do not recommend reading the book before the movie...it will ruin the movie! But as always the book is a thousand percent better!
2,I Recommend the Book,"I read the book and loved it. Sadly, the film was a disappointment. I saw it once and would rather watch paint dry than sit through this film again."
2,Disappointed,"I was really disappointed with this book. I thought it would be more of a love story. I found it to be more factual than story based and there was a lot of; in my option, religious view pushing."
5,Inspiring story,"When I saw this movie trailer, I knew that it had to be based on a book. I found the Kim and Krickitt Carpenter Story and read it within a couple of days. It is an inspiring story of true love and unwavering faith. I recommend it for anyone. It is a very uplifting story."
3,Good book but not so much in story form,"I liked this book but was expecting more of a story instead of just the husbands accounts of what happened. But, I must say, the book was far better than the movie. I was disappointed that the movie was titled ""The Vow"" because it was actually not about the book at all, only inspired by it. Definately a good read."
3,Pretty Good,"I was very intrigued by this story after reading the back of the book in a bookstore. I downloaded it to my e-reader, and read it in a 24 hour period. It was a good story with a very uplifting message. It was not of the caliber of some reads on the shelves these days, but it is not fiction either. It is amazing to think about all this couple went through at such young ages, and with so little relational history behind them. I like that they did not hide the more difficult parts of their journey, as that would have been too convenient a story. The realism made their commitment even more admirable and touching. I have not seen the movie, but I would be interested to see it played out. Overall, I would recommend the book for what it is - a heartwarming and encouraging story with a happy ending - but I wouldn't tell anyone to rush right out and get it."
1,Did not like,"just a quick review. i read this book in one day...i really wanted to hear the story of a loving couple but in the end i really did not like the book. i felt like it was really rushed and i had a hard time getting to know the characters and who they really were. i thought the accident scene and hospital and even recovery should have been told more indepth and descriptive.it was ok, with a happy ending but i wouldn't recommend this book i think it could be a VERY good book if someone took time with it but they didn't :("
2,Book Review,The story was very poorly written (amateurish). In this case the movie can only be better.Don't waste your money on this book.
2,None,"not what i expected .very right wing christian!!! hoped for a bit more passion. amazing tale but felt kricket was silenced, and think she is more the hero than god or chris.but wish them well. appreicate the story."
2,The movie makes it so Hollywood-ized!,"2 1/2 stars. I will be fair though and say I don't normally like these kind of books. Not so into the memoirs and I don't like reading books about religion. With that aside, it wasn't all too bad. It wasnt great either though. I think I would have liked to see more conversation between Krickett and Kim, especially when they started dating again. I will agree with others and say I am sure the movie will actually be better than the book. I guess I'm looking for a more Hollywood style story here that the movie clips make it seem."
2,Mislead by the trailer for the movie,"After seeing the trailer for the movie adaptation, I researched the true story, found the book online and decided to buy it. I was truly enthralled by this couple's life story and I was very excited to read about how they got through such a trying experience. What I didn't realize is how much Christianity, God and prayer influenced the couple and how important it was to their story. As a non-religious person, I had trouble getting through the book since so much of it details their relationships with God and their faith. The section marked Krickett's Diary was especially difficult since her whole world wraps around something that I don't believe in. It wasn't a bad book per se, just not my cup of tea. Also, I was pretty disappointed with the writing as a whole and I often found myself taken out of the magic of their story because there wasn't a great flow."
1,Terrible,"The beginning had me captivated and then lost my attention. Definitely not a movie I would pay to see. The end was poorly written, jumping back and forth from his to her narration. The ramblings on in the end about all the shows, reporters, etc...shouldn't have been included. Just terrible."
4,Such A Good Book,This was such a good book. There was a couple of places that seemed to go on forever but for the most part it was good. I liked that it was a mostly true story.
2,watch the movie instead,I was hoping to read a book that followed the movie and this isn't it. This is more of a factual account of the events that inspired the movie rather then a love story with some drama mixed in. It is a true tale of love that is inspirational but again I was hoping to read more of what the movie had to offer
5,Speechless,"I don't think I can praise this book enough or even find the right words to express my thoughts. Not to take away from anyone because I known that a lot of time, energy, finances go into the making of a centematic and/or live production - but this is by far better than the movie and in my opinion if you refuse to read this, you are missing out on a lot more than you realize. This an amazing story of a love that refuses to be forgotten and holds true to the words ""in sickness and in health till do us part."" An absolute must read - paperback, eBook, audio, whichever version you wish, but I highly recommend this!!!Here is a brief summery: The night before Thanksgiving In 1993 Kim & Krickitt were involved in a near fatal car accident just 10 weeks after they were married. Both sustained serious injuries, Krickitt's more serious and permanent. After awaking from a coma, Krickitt cannot recall her husband Kim, meeting him, being married to him, their wedding, or even their courtship."
3,The Vow,I found this book to be an enjoyable quick read. A nice love story of commitment and the spiritual guidance of God holding together a family in difficult times. A great true story.
1,Wish I would have just watched the movie!,Although the story is a great testimony to our Lord and Savior. I found it boring to read. I still would like to see the movie.
3,Not terrible but I thought it would be better. If i could go back I wouldnt have bought it.,I am the type of person who always feels the book is far better than the movie. This however was the extreme opposite. I always read the book first as I did w/this one & it was difficult becuz it didnt hold my attn well at all.
2,Country Superstars Volume 1 Comments,"This album contains 20 songs from some very good Country & Western recording artists. The recording quality is excellent, but if you're expecting to receive a CD with the original recordings of those artists, you'll be very disappointed. The artists are original, but the songs are either remakes, or recordings made during shows. They are not what you remember hearing on the radio years ago. The songs are good, but if you insist on having original recordings, then I don't recommend buying this CD."
4,From the back of the book:,"Over a century's worth of pastoral wisdom can be found in this compact book for seminarians and new or seasoned pastors. The authors come from two different cultural traditions, but they uphold the same ministry values and goals as pastors. This compact book provides a rare opportunity for others to learn from both the successes and the challenges of two highly esteemed and respected pastors who have each been preaching for more than sixty years. Topics include:the important traits in being a pastor,pitfalls to avoid for young pastors,how to deal with difficult people in the church,books that should be on every pastor's shelf and why,the best way to prepare a sermon, andprinciples of pastoral counseling."
3,Comfortable but defective laces,"I really found these shoes to be very comfortable and nice looking, however the first day I wore them the suede laces became untied. When I retied them for the second time, the lace broke although I did not pull excessively hard on them. Because the laces do not go all the way around, but rather are two separate laces per shoe that are stuck to the heel area of the shoe, I couldn't even adjust the lace to tie it again. For fairly expensive shoes, I would expect them to be high quality. I've never had a suede lace break like that before, even for a cheaper product."
5,You don't have to like football....,"If I enjoyed this book, you Carolina Panther fans are going to love it. It's not just about the team. There are stories about the individual players - really sweet, poignant stories. And it's a book that you can put down (if you have to) because it's written in relatively unconnected chapters. As Scott puts in his introduction, ""Whether you like to read in small sips or big gulps, you should be set.""To those who appreciate malaprops - there's a chapter on one of the Panthers who's as quotable as Yogi Berra. And remember the famous picture of Muhsin Muhammad's shushing the crowd? That story (as well as the picture) is in here.Scott Fowler makes the players human. After reading this book, when you see one being interviewed you'll think, ""Oh yeah. That's the one Scott said...."""
5,It's like you were on the Sideline with the Panthers!!,"When I read Scott Fowler's book, Tales From TheCarolina Panthers Sideline, I felt like I was pacing the sideline with the Panthers. Fowler was able to take me to the sidelines and locker room of this exciting and mercurialteam. I have been a faithful reader of Scott Fowler's columns over the years in The Charlotte Observer newspaper and felt certain my personal time devoted to reading this book wouldbe time well spent, and it was. I feel as though I now know the players, coaches and owner in a way the average fan wishes they could. The journey through the storied 2003-2004 season whichtook the Panthers to an appearance in the Super Bowl has been captured by Scott Fowler in such a way that any Panthers fan will want to relive the ride again and again. And with Tales From The Carolina Panthers Sideline, they can. This is a must have for any football fan -- and especially Panther fans!! Enjoy!!"
5,AN ABSOLUTE MUST FOR PANTHER FANS!!!,"""Tales from the Carolina Panthers Sideline"" is a must for fans of the Carolina Panthers and fans of the NFL in general. Scott Fowler, who is a mainstay in the Charlotte Observer sports section, skillfully recaps the magical 2003 Carolina Panthers super bowl season. Using a unique style, Fowler re-creates the 2003 season, and also takes a trip back into the sometimes checkered past of the Franchise. Fowler, who co-authored thefantastic 1997 book ""Year of the Cat"" recapping the second season of the franchise, has worked his magic once again. I had the pleasure of attending a pair of Panther home games in 2003, including the playoff win over the Cowboys. ""Tales from the Carolina Panthers Sideline"" makes me feel like I attended all of the games.Rob EastwoodNews/Sports DirectorWJRI Radio, Lenoir North Carolina"
5,Sports fan,This book is one of those great sports tales that they make an move of.It is not written just for the fotballfans.If u are just an guy that likes sports this book will be an great read for u.But if you are an Panthers fan or u got an Panthers fan in your family the book is a must.It covers everything that happened that season on the field in the locerroom and of the field.It makes you wanna play football.And it really touches you when you read how strong Sam Mills was to fight cancer be a couch and father at the same time.Man you just got to read it.That is all I got to say to you.Scott Fowler wrote a great book I became an Panthers fan after I read
1,Ripoff!,Bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died ONE WEEK after their return/replacement deadline. Shouldn't a cell phone battery last longer than a month?? They refuse to refund or replace. They are a shady company and I'll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same.
2,Apple adapter,What a disappointment! I had a non-Apple product -- so thought I was ordering GENUINE Apple products -- but no such thing!I guess the saving grace was that it was not too expensive
3,Good info but lacking in punch,Very interesting book if you know nothing about Chinese intelligence. But book is a little short on real hard hitting edge to chinese espinage. I would recommend the book for all seeking good overview of chinese intelligence operations.
1,"Expensive, exceedingly brief, not worth the trouble.","Coming in at a little over one hundred pages this ""book"" reads more like a long term paper. Having paid something like $27 for this ""pamphlet"" I felt cheated. Further, the substance of the book was not even that revealing, yes the Chinese spy on the US and yes they have the patience to wait years to make recruitments, I spent $27 for that? Save your money, although there are pitfully few books on Chinese Intelligence, this ""work"" barely merits the prestige of being called a ""book"" let alone your hard earned dollars."
4,Good book,"Also see ""China's Intelligence and Internal Security Forces: Jane's Special Report"" (1999). Unfortunately, it's out-of-print and very, very expensive..."
4,microwaveable,"as the title suggests, you microwave it, it gets warm, you put it against your back on a seat. hence, ""microwaveable""."
1,Lack of Product Info,"Info very limited on this product. Is it electric? Is it microwavable jel, microbeads,sand? If you want folks to buy the product, more info would sure help."
1,How is it used?,"I would not buy this item because there is not enough information provided about it. Is it electric, battery powered? Microwavable? Or is it like the moist heat packs used in Physical Therapy; then how would you heat it? Don't you think Amazon could describe this thing a little better so we didn't have to go outside the site to get information about it?"
4,Fairy Tale mysteries -- who would've thunk?,"this is a good book! and a good series I might add. it's light. it's tight. it's all right. it's an easy read. good link-ups in terms of all the fairy tales we all grew up with. entertaining. very easy to read -- did i say that already? the story hooks you in. there isnt huge character development, but these books are meant for a younger crowd -- so it's more about the story line and the fairy tale characters. the story moves along at a nice pace and never gets stuck or boring or too verbose or heavy with too much description. action and dialogue abound throughout.two point two five thumbs up."
3,A Review for Adults (who still like kids' lit),"I saw this book at a local shop and briefly perused it, then got home and ordered it from Amazon without looking at the specs. I hadn't realized these books were ""fairy-tale mysteries""; it appeared (during that first perusal) that it was a mystery of the Trixie-Belden ilk, though with younger protagonists. It starts out a lot like the ""Series of Unfortunate Events,"" since the girls are orphans and have been in various bad foster homes (many of which are recounted for the reader's indignation). Then they get to Ferryport Landing, and the fairy tale stuff starts.This is when it immediately became very twee (""Ferryport Landing was formerly named 'Fairyport Landing'"") and contrived. I finished the book because I liked a couple of the characters (NOT the sisters) and wanted to see how it turned out. It is probably all right for children at the recommended reading age, though these days, how many kids know the Grimm fairy tales on which this book is based?"
1,Not worth the paper its printed on,"I not only did not connect with the main character, I avidly disliked her from beginning to end. When there finally was a character I thought was interesting, he was spoiled by unlikeable characteristics as well. The plot was half-baked and just . . . not fun.Honestly, there was not anything I liked in the book. Sorry!"
5,"Skip the fluff, kids love great books!","My first-grade son is almost 7 and cannot get enough of this book. For the first time, we are reading something together that neither of us wants to put down. He begs for two more pages, and I cave every time.If you're not sure if your child is old enough for this book, buy it anyway and read it for yourself. This is the kind of literature that inspires a lifelong love of reading."
5,"A GREAT, UNUSUAL BOOK ... Fantastic idea ...","Well, here's Granny again ... buying another book for the grandkids and getting hooked on it myself!!!What an original idea this author had--the Grimm SISTERS, indeed.Anyone who loves the original ""The Brothers Grimm"" will love these new takes on beloved old characters ... maybe even more so. I especiially enjoyed Michael Buckley's idea of a character based on Jack of ""Jack and The Beanstalk"" fame. Ha-ha ... Excellent!Humor! Excitement! Adventure!Highly recommended."
5,Sisters Grimm,"When I first started to read this book it didn't quite appeal to me but while just trying to push through the beginning, I discovered the magical, adventurous story of two young girls' relationship and their new life in a small, mysterious town somewhere in New York. Their confusion and sadness in the beginning of the book turns into love and understanding in the end while the sisters take on an action-packed adventure trying to save their family. After reading the first book, I turned to the rest of the series, expecting the same comfort in reading as I had passing through the first one. Michael Buckley has turned this story into a series that should be enjoyed throughout the world. -Mayme Schmitz (age 11)"
5,"Clever, funny, smart, and full of wonderful reveals.","Clever, funny, smart, and full of wonderful reveals. I've been wanting to start this series for a long time, but ever since my wife and I opened a bookstore (21 years ago), I've been swimming in books that I SIMPLY MUST READ. But now I've gone and done it: I've started the series. And it is every bit as good as my children have been promising me.My oldest child read the series while it was being written, meaning she had to wait between books. It's very humorous to hear her talk: Oh, you want borrow book two now, huh? (this series lives on a shelf in her room) Do you KNOW how long I had to wait for book two? or book 3? or book 4? (then she narrows her eyes, and a cold chill seeps into her voice ) I had to wait between every book in this series. Do you have ANY idea how lucky you have it?Yes. I do.I do. I do. I do.One last thing: Peter Ferguson's illustrations are to die for.(less)"
4,"Finally, a New Series Worth Reading","In a desperate attempt to find a series of new books, I stumbled across The Sisters Grimm. Thank goodness. It's inventive, funny, original and action packed. Sabrina and Daphne Grimm are sent to live their 'thought to be dead' grandmother after their parents go missing. What happens next combines the believable and the unbelievable into a cohesive storyline that leaves you waiting for the next in the series."
4,fun book,"I read about this series on a friend's blog, she had bought the series for her daughter. I bought it for myself because I love to read juvenile books. It is a fun, easy, fast read. I love the story, it is funny and fun to read. In fact I ordered the rest of the series after reading the first one and will keep them for when my Granddaughter is old enough to read them."
5,My book review,"This is one of my all time favorite books, and that is a big compliment considering that I have at least, literally 300. I love this book because it blends in fairytales with with modern day socitey. It is such an orignal idea, I mean, I know that I could never think of something like this in a million years. I reccomend this book to people who love a good story and have a sense of humor.-Carson (age 13)"
3,Not as good as H1 or H2 - but still decent,"I have owned the H1 and H2 and they are superior in quality compared to this camera. I use the H7 for work and bought it as a replacement for the H2 when the H2's shutter button stopped working. I have the H1 as my personal camera and it is by far the best in quality. My main concerns with the H7 are that it activates the flash when it doesn't seem to be necessary, the optics don't seem to be as good as the two previous models and the camera just feels ""cheaper"" by comparison. When I took pictures with the other cameras, I got some amazing shots. Like my dog's whiskers in perfect focus from across the room. If you can get a hold of an H1 somewhere, jump on it."
2,Not a bad camera but hard and soft too Sony-specific,"The camera is not bad. What is dissapointing are that cables, batteries, charger (hardware) and software are Sony-specific so be ready to proliferation and spend a couple of hundred dollars more in accesories if you want back ups."
1,Sony Cybershot H7,"The Sony Cybershot appeared to be a great little ca mera and turned out to be a major disappointment. Most companies include the memory card in the box, but Sony requires the customer to obtain it separately at additional cost. In addition, the specs do not indicate the size filter the camera takes, if any. I've had several digitals and found downloading a very simple procedure, but the H7 is anything but user-friendly. I followed the complicated instruction a number of times with no success, even resorting to the Sony Help line. Without downloading the camera is useless and so I returned it."
3,DHSC-H7: Buena con limitaciones,Buena óptica. Tanto el macro como el zoom óptico 15X permiten obtener buenas imágenes. El flash tiene muy buen alcance y permite imágenes de calidad. Tanto el menú de visualización como el de grabación son claros y bien organizados.LIMITACIONES: El formato de la cámara es incómodo. Hay que ser muy cuidadoso al sostenerla para no tocar el display y mancharlo con tus huellas digitales. El botón del macro es incómodo pues al sostener la cámara puedes pulsarlo involuntariamente. No recomiendo usar el ISO de alta sensibilidad ni el zoom digital. Las imágenes resultan pobres en ambos casos. Para ser 8.1 megapixeles esperaba mayor definición de imagen.
5,Christmas Made Easy,I purchased the Sony DSC H7 as a Christmas gift for my son and daughter-in-law. The whole Amazon experience was the easiest thing I did all season. The camera is great with all the slide show features and amazing zoom and pixels. The shipping was fast and free and I paid less than I could buy it for locally. And they gave me some wonderful pictures of my grand-daughter with Cinderella at her castle. Even our extended family loved the camera.
5,My Camera,"I received the camera almost a week before it said I would. I was so happy that I got it so early because I was going to a music festival and wanted to use it really bad. I got it only a day after I bought it and everything was great. I got the camera and loved it! It had great zoom. It focused fast and took great pictures. The only thing I noticed was that when you take a picture, the camera focuses on what is closer, and I couldn't figure out how to focus on what I wanted. It works really easy and is great for begining photographers and children, as long as they are careful. I was so grateful to amazon.com because I bought it at less than the manufacturer and didn't have to sacrafice quality or service. Thank you Amazon.com!"
2,DSC-H7,"I've owned the camera for 3 months, have taken very good quality pictures. Am impressed by the good quality of low light pictures with no flash. But, it now has a vertical line in each picture and is seen in the view finder. I'm returning it to Sony for repair/replacement, lets see how it goes. -- Sony replaced the ccd, returned it one day after recieving it. rh 4stars"
2,not happy with nighttime indoor pictures at all very grainy,"outdoors this camera takes crisp clear pictures and the stop-action is great.indoors at night however flash or no flash, the pictures are really grainy. i have tried resetting the camera and no help.i don't know what to do."
1,Will I ever learn?,"I've never written a review before but this was such a waste of money I felt compelled. The reviewer before had it exactly - someone set up a camera and left it on. The only way I could tell there was motion (on most of the shots) was to speed it up to 16x or more. If it had been all just waves, that might have been ok. But 10 minutes of a single flower slightly swaying in the breeze...which could have been filmed anywhere...SAVE YOUR MONEY!! You can HAVE my copy since I won't ever use it again."
1,Goes to show you...,"...that you can't always trust other ... reviewers. This DVD is .... The quality is poor, the music is boring; it looks like someone set up a home video camera at different places and clipped a bunch of scenes together. There is very little activity in the shots, you have to watch carefully to notice that they aren't still photos. Try something else."
4,True Murder story.......,"Bought this book because my great Grandfather was involved in the trial as a witness who lied. Unfortunately there was only 1 sentence about him, none of the consequences he received. It was an interesting book about the times. But I was disappointed I did not learn more about my great Grandfather. He was also wealthy. It is a sad story. Would probably make a good movie."
3,Interesting book,The book was rather interesting with some of the historical data that it contained. Nothing too exciting and it was a bit of a slow read for me anyway.
1,latin muzak,"it is not street candombe, but some homogenized drek that is overproduced andwants to make you leave the room, or use the cd as a frisbeeI think they have listened to too much Herb Alperthad high hopes for it"
4,a great super special,"this was one of my favourite BSC super specials. The plots I enjoyed most were how the art classes claudia and mallory were taking turned out, and how jessi met quint. Reading all about new york made me want to go there, the descriptions are well written"
2,Where Is Debs?,"I am a great admirer of Eugene V. Debs, so I waited with great anticipation for the arrival of this work. I was sadly disappointed. It IS a very interesting history of the times--but is rarely talks about Debs or much related to him. It is a misnomer to use his name in the title. If looking for a biography of Debs--look to The Bending Cross or Debs: Citizen & Socialist."
1,Big disappointment!,"This book was a big disappointment. I bought what I thought was a biography on the great socialist leader Eugene Debs only to find that it was a long winded, pretentious and disjointed meditation on the socialist movement and the utopian communities that led up to it.I don't know what Marguerite Young was thinking when she decided to tackle this project but it certainly wasn't a biography in the traditional sense. I guess I should have paid more attention to the words 'Harp Song' in the title because that's what this book really was- a bloody long harp song.I suppose that if you're a fan of Young's prose you might appreciate this book but for anyone looking to get some insight into the life of Eugene Victor Debs- you'll have to go elsewhere."
5,Just Visiting,This book was a great because it told you a lot about Madison and her Mom because it exposed a lot of things that happened when Madison's mom was a kid. And madison got her first kiss at her Grandmas house and it turned out to be the best suumer vaction she ever had
5,Abraham on Top Form as always !,"I second Louise Hay and Wayne Dyer when they say that the Abraham Hicks teaching are among the most advanced you will find, it's also however the simplest. Anybody looking to improve their life in any way will find benefit from this DVD.It's another fabulous addition to the Abraham-Hicks ""Law of Attraction in Action"" series.My husband says ""More great insights from Abraham to add to my collection""I just say - Buy the DVD ! If you are new to the Abraham Hicks material it's the best investment you will ever make...........If you are already familiar with their work, you don't need my words to tell you how wonderful this material is........Enjoy !"
4,Know who you are,"As a life coach, if you are struggling to love your self and need help seeing the real you, this will be life changing."
5,Who you really are,Outstanding presentation. Abraham just keeps getting better and better. Answers to many questions. Info on new subjects. Very highly recommended.
3,Tired Music,"The effort was just more of the same old MULE. There was really nothing new. What Warren preformed was great, just stale."
5,Piece of good music!,"Studio version of known pieces. Very good collection of blues/rock music. Perfect studio work, perfect sound. Must be a part of CD collection:)"
5,great,"This album is simply great. Maybe better than it's predecessor, the album is definitely a lot different. While volume 1 had some more catchy and single-worthy songs, this one works better as an entire album. It also includes some darker Haynes' originals (Wolrd of Confusion, Which Way Do We Run) and a straight jazz song (Babylon Turnpike). The latter really surprised me, but was quite impressive. Also, Lay of the Sunflower kept me hitting the repeat button for hours- Great acoustic tune.Warren Haynes is a god. His slide playing on volume 2 covers more territory than it has on recent mule albums, and as always is fantastic.buy the album"
5,You gotta hear this one,"Like a lot of live bands, it's hard to capture the real essence ofGovt Mule on a studio recording. And indeed, there's a very differenthere than you'd hear in a live concert. But Mule has done a remarkablejob of getting the most out of each song. The studio setting allowsall the nuance to come through, yet the interplay between the musicianskeeps it all fresh and alive. Despite the wide range of styles andmusicians, it all still feels like Mule. Check out the extended jamon ""What Is Hip?"" or ""Catfish Blues"", or the soulful vocals on ""HammerAnd Nails"". Each song is polished up like its own little jewel, allowingeach to shine. If you liked Deep End Vol. 1, you'll love this one.If you didn't, what's *wrong* with you?And oh, yeah, go and see 'em live, too. They'll blow you away."
3,deep,"I enjoyed Deep end vol 1, also. Warren I thought was great just because of his awesome name, but he has a distinct voice and great guitar playing. I love hearing him sit in with other bands also. He brings so much to the table when he is playing."
5,Recommended,I enjoyed listening to this CD another Gov't Mule classic Excellent to my personal taste Recommended
4,Very Creative,"I love the fact that these guys have taken their personal tragedy (the death of beloved bassist Allen Woody) and generated new vitality and spark. The inclusion of such a variety of guest bass players forces the band to experiment outside the lines without losing their 'sound'. This second volume has more extended jams than volume one. I personally liked the more pop oriented songs of vol. 1 better, but put both volumes in your CD player and you have a total picture of what the Mule is all about."
3,Dantes's Purgatorio,The package came tattered and torn and the book was wet on the back I had to dry it off hoping it would be ok as it was a Christmas present for my grandson .
1,STAY AWAY!,"Stay away from Lingo, you will have nothing but problems... oh, and good luck trying to cancel the account... they won't let you."
3,Historical re-release,"Hesperion XX were pioneers in reviving this music, and collectors will value these recordings which first came out in 1976. However most listeners may prefer more recent recordings by Wimmer on Naxos, and Alia Musica on Harmonia Mundi which have digital sound and include Spanish, and occasionally Hebrew, texts and translations."
3,Dissappointing soprano,"I was excitet buying this CD, expecting the quality of songs equal or better thanBegona Olavide and Carlos Paniagua on MA recodings. The music was fine but singing by soprano Montserrat Figueras was borderline annoying."
1,Can't Believe This Stuff,"I only bought this book because an elderly gentleman at an assisted living home told me about it. He was trying to find a copy, so I ordered one for him and one for me, just so I could see what he was talking about. He opposes the author's beliefs, as do I. The fear of racial contamination expressed by the author reminds me of the fear of 'gay' contamination of marriage today. Irrational!"
4,Good - but not in one weekend,"This book proves to be the best virtually all-encompassing prep tool for The Excel 2002 Microsoft Office Specialist Exam. That being said, you won't do it in one weekend - as the hype fallaciously proclaims - unless you're one of two things - an Excel freak or ... settling for the Core cert.I just passed the Expert Exam today. 45 minutes for 14 multi-part questions. You need a 780/1000. It's no cakewalk, so to speak, but then again, I am an Expert. The only areas on the Expert exam where you need to get more info that aren't covered in this book are: customizing macros, subtotal options within PivotTables, and custom number formats. This book has a practice file from the CD_ROM for each and every lesson in this book - very helpful. It's very well written and comes highly recommended - I mean, we're talking Barabara Clemens."
3,"Decent protection, no padding","Most exercise equipment mats provide some padding. This is not a padding mat. It's rather stiff vinyl, and will protect from indentations and spills, but it won't cushion you much. It's also much thinner than other mats. All of which may be better or worse for your application than a thicker mat; for example, this line is perfect for under a treadmill.A minor problem is that it isn't perfectly rectangular. My guess is it is cut off of long rolls and sometimes the angle is a bit off. This only interferes with getting it to line up with both walls in a corner, and it is minor."
3,"Ok, but not really for equipment","The mat is made out of a very soft, pliable material. I wouldn't put equipment on it, but it's fine to do body-type workouts like crunch's or pilates."
4,Sationary Bicycle Mat,Good product. Thick enough to cushion bicycle and save wear and tear on flooring. Priced very reasonable. Would buy again.
5,NOW THIS IS A GREAT VIDEO COLLECTION!!,"IF YOU WERE UNFORTUNATE TO HAVE MISSED A LOT OF LUTHER'S VIDEOS, THIS IS THE BEST DVD YOU COULD EVER PURCHASE. THIS DVD SHARES WITH YOU ALL OF HIS VIDEOS IN A NUT SHELL, CREATING A PRIVATE CONCERT WITH JUST YOU AND LUTHER IN YOUR VERY HOME. IT'S CLOSE, QUIET, PERSONAL, ROMANTIC, AND VERY SATISFYING......TRUST ME."
5,great find and great price,the video and music cd were in perfect condition and such a rare find i enjoyed the video and watch it often and the price for both of them was too good to be true. i don't think i could have been more satisfied.
4,Nuances of power and self esteem explored,"With of plenty of self-awareness (not treating snobbery as something that happens just to other people), Epstein fleshes many forms of snobbery that effect American culture. I found the first half of the book intriguing. There he describes the mechanisms of snobbery. The section about college affected me a lot, touching upon many of my own issues of status. Much of the second half, or last third really, went into specifics about certain cultural icons and fashions. Though I didn't find that as interesting, that just demonstrates my own preference for the abstract; it is written well and is very engaging. In general, I found the book to be thought provoking and it has stayed with me weeks after I have finished it. Sort of like eating a refreshing meal, the book had just the right balance of intellectual nutrients."
4,A delightful look at the history of Snobbery in America,"Epstein has given us a wonderful look at how snobbery has evolved through the years in America. The book breaks down into chapters based on subject grouping (A classic example is the chapter on college snobbery, where the author discusses which universities are the ""hot"" ones to have attended) and covers everyhting from the old-money new money class distinction, to the decline of the modern WASP.Basically, Epstein takes a slightly satirical look at how the American Snob has evolved. Written from a qausi-insider perspectvie (Epstein playfully admits to fitting a number of his snob categories) the book gives us a look at how snobbism has affected our cultural history as Americans, and assures us that the snob is alive and well today in america.Over all this is a fine intellectual read. Epstein's dry senes of humor keeps the book from being dry, and his ""insiders perspective"" makes the satire work even better."
2,Simply annoying.,"To mimic a sentence structure that Mr. Epstein employs ad nauseum throughout his book, a perfect storm of smug vapidness, this. The author seems to think that he can innoculate himself against the charge of being a snob himself, by admitting to it once in a while. Fair enough. But it doesn't keep him from coming off as mean (as in his treatment of the author Phyllis Rose--how ironic that he would talk about her coming across as a snob in her wonderful memoir!) and judgemental (as in his treatment of vegetarians whom, and he annoyingly waffles on this one, he seems to conclude are a self-righteous lot who have made throwing dinner parties a nuisance).Mr. Epstein is at his worst when he goes on about his fascination with fashionable coats and cigarette lighters. Boring. And pitiable, really.Sorry, but Mr. Epstein's own glaring snobbery overshadows this book of warmed over observations on the subject."
4,Epstein illuminates...,"Joe Epstein's book is a fascinating read. I enjoyed it a great deal. The book is at it's strongest when Epstein talks about his own snobbish tendencies. A few parts are a bit slow, particularly in the beginning, but your faith will be rewarded in the second part of the book when Epstein goes after various kinds of snobbery. The book is strengthed by Epstein's admission to his own snobberies--as they used to say it takes one to know one (and indeed as Epstein titles one chapter)--and can't help but have you look at yourself often. Epstein quotes many writers in his book and at times I wanted to shut the book rather than read another Balzac or Proust quote. Nevertheless, there are times when Epstein is so on target--particularly about the French--that you laugh out loud. I wonder what Epstein would say about all the media attention his book has been getting....A great snapshot of America in the 21st century. We need more writers like him."
2,Just plain boring,"This book just did not hold my interest. It is a literary examination about snobbery in all its forms and root causes. Therefore, the author develops these ponderous essays on different sub-topics that dawdle and go nowhere. I could have cut the length of this book in half and gotten the same knowledge. The author's examples from his own life start to become tiresome. Instead, I wish the author had developed other, juicy examples of snobbery of the elite classes worth dishing about. I actually got on learning about snobbery from Toby Young's book, ""How to loose friends and Alienate people"", which shows the shallowness of the New York literary scene in the late 90's.I would recommend this book if you want to understand on a conceptual level what snobbery is about in its complete underbelly, but I would not recommend this book as an entertaining read."
3,Would have been better minus the grammatical mistakes,"Overall an enjoyable and largely accurate account of snobbery based on the American social class system, but I was annoyed by the consistent mistakes in grammar, especially given that they were made by someone who has been an English professor at a respected university for more than 20 years.There are many better books on this subject matter, but ""Snobbery"" is a well-researched, entertaining read."
2,"Author is a snob, too","The book had some enjoyable and interesting bits, but the author goes on and on about himself to an extent that soon becomes tedious. It is obvious that he is a dreadful snob, although he claims to have reformed. I shudder to think of what he would have been like before his reformation."
1,Who cares what Joseph Epstein thinks?,"I picked this book up at an airport bookstore because - after a few quick looks - it seemed worth paying for.I WAS SO WRONG!This book is filled with meanness after meanness. Epstein tells us in the first chapter that he is a snob - but he makes himself seem like a charming snob, reformed, almost repentant. NOT TRUE!This man drops name after name of people, books and artists (the more obscure the ""better,"" of course). He goes on and on about his fancy (then fancier) raincoats. He envies poor dead Allan Bloom his possessions. And Epstein is so far gone that he even thinks stories of how he ""used"" his kids are winning.If only I could give this book negative stars!If only I could get my money back."
1,Snobbery: Ther American Version,"I didn't find the information particularly enlightening. I had the feeling that the author was ""stretching"" so as to write a book. I liked his fiction more."
1,Disappointing,"Too much windy waffle, not enough examples. Doesn't this academic know how to write an essay?"
4,Best Shoes EVER ...almost...,"This will be my third pair. I would give them a 5-star rating and in fact DO give them 5 for comfortability. My complaint is that they seem to wear out quickly. I only wear them for walking and power-shopping (i.e., blazing through Wal-Mart, Costco and the like). Please note that I am NOT a power-walker as in terms of physical fitness.I hate sneakers and they hate me. Thus I found these shoes and gave them a try. Wearing them IS like walking on air -- but only for so long.I do recommend them. Believe me, it bites having to shell out so much money for shoes -- but they are the only shoes I've ever worn that didn't hurt my feet. Now, if I could just talk our daughter into letting me wear them to her wedding next year...Enjoy!"
2,Dissappointing cacophony,"Whichever album is your preferred Low sound, you may feel as frustrated as I am by this one. Low seem determined to avoid satisfying anyone, or being pigeonholed by their past. Fine, express your artistic vision, but at least be listenable...! There are no standout tracks. This music has an angry sound, and unfortunately little beauty, haunting or otherwise. A real disappointment."
2,Drones-ville,"I remember going to Low shows in the late 1990's/early 2000's and being blown away. I raved to all my friends about this band who performs haunting pop songs at a snail's pace. How much power they had, even in their minimalism! I WORE OUT their first three albums.Their newer albums, however, are just not for me. Sparhawk and Mimi's vocals are often reduced to droning harmonic weaves. And I'm sorry, but I need a musical melody more than once in a while!Sonic Youth went through this phase, too. Great, memorable albums in the 80s and 90s, then experimental, unlistenable drone-fests in the 2000s because they established themselves and ""could.""Hey, Low and Sonic Youth can do whatever they want. But I don't have to like it. :)"
3,Low's Haunted House,"Drums and Guns has an overall war theme, and the use of guitar feedback and clanking, shuffling rhythms provide an appropriate background to the anti-war lyrics, but Low's strength has always been in making music that develops. In doing so, they have given themselves the opportunity to have their music make a strong impression, gratifying both themselves and their listeners. With this effort, however, the brevity of the songs give the impression that you are wandering from room to room in a high-tech haunted house, where the electronic ghosts sputter for a few minutes, then disappear."
5,Springboard for Self-Discovery...,"Fruitflesh - Seeds of Inspiration for Women Who Write by Gayle Brandeis offers women writers a path to understanding their ""life-essence"" and their true reason for creating. As the beginnings of life sprout from a seed so does a woman writers words as she puts pen to paper. Gayle offers meditations and writing exercises that challenge writers to really go within - into their bodies and minds in search of their authentic selves. Fruitflesh is a springboard for self-discovery and a confirmation of the reasons we as women choose to write.Sheri' L. McConnell, MAOMFounder of the National Association of Women Writers - NAWW"
5,Seeds of Inspiration for All,"As a writer -- and a male -- I found this book extraordinarily helpful. Dudes, don't let the Women Who Write in the title scare you away, there is wisdom here for all."
5,A Meditator's Friend,"I need to say I am the author's aunt-in-law but had only heard 3rd hand about her new book. I'd just gotten back from a week's meditation retreat and Fruitflesh was a great re-entry guide. Reading it helped prolong that delicious blend of body awarenesses and trusting each moment. Just as Anne Lamott's Bird by Bird brings you more deeply into your every day life, Fruitflesh brings you, fruit by fruit, back to your every day body and your every moment senses. A meditative eater's best friend."
5,Great Water Cups for Around the Cooler,These are great water cups that are economical and perefectly suited to the water cooler. Rather than being annoyed with the little 3 ounce paper cups that you need to refill about three times to satiate one's thirst why not get some decent size cups that will add some class around the cooler.
1,Incorrect Author,"This book is not written, as advertised, by the poet Beckian Fritz Goldberg. This information needs to be changed so people aren't mislead, as I was. Also, the book is full of right-wing Christian propgaganda."
4,Classic Comedy,"This movie gives monkeys a bad name?This comedy really stinks up the works and nobody escapes unsatirized ?The three stooges may be worse slap stick but not by much.A 30's gangland style subplot has gats, molls and ""beat it"".In the happy ending the gang boss gets his kidnapped daughter back."
2,it lacks of creativity,"This cd has covers and some Lucero's old hits.someone told in other review that Paulina Rubio doesn""t have the 1/4 the voice that Lucero has, but the difference is, Paulina Rubio takes the risk to record different music .On the other hand.Lucero prefered to record her old songs, what a drag!!!!!c'mon. Lucero you can give your opinion in your productions.But. It is always a pleasure to hear her voice."
5,"Is Exactly What It Says, and More Durable Than It Looks","Inexpensive, super durable and ships fast. What more could a man want?Just remember, though, when it says ""youth"", it means ""youth"". That's my fault, though."
5,Ahead of its time,"After reading Soon Will Come the Light, I looked for a copy of Light on the Horizon. I was dismayed to find that it was out of print. However, I kept looking, and eventually, I was lucky enough to be able to purchase a used copy. What a treasure I have found! I smiled the whole way through the book.Thomas has such a warm, personal, writing style. He makes you feel as if you are reading letters from a friend. I adored his wit and sense of humor!And, if that weren't enough, the insights were amazing. I found it hard to believe that this book was published nearly 10 years ago. Some of the ideas put forth were way ahead of their time. Thomas definitely had a vision! I find it very difficult to believe that this book is out of print. I sincerely believe that a second edition should be printed!Keep looking for this book. You won't be sorry!"
1,WHEELS COME OFF,"DO NOT BUYDo not buy anything from Atlantic that has spinner wheels. I bought a Graphite Lite bag and less than a week later one of the wheels came off. Their grand 20 year warranty does not include wheels. I was contacted by the company who said I could send my piece to them and they would give me an estimate for repair. Horrible service, bad product. It is a shame. This was my first luggage purchase over $100. Next time I'll go back to Target an d buy the cheap stuff. At least that way I won't feel so bad when it breaks."
1,Just a piece of worthless junk!!!,"I purchased this watch in Feb. 2008. After I received it, I put it away because my current Seiko was still working great and has been for over 20 years. Recently I took this watch out of its display box and put it on. Almost instantly within the first 24 hours, I noticed it was running fast by about 2 minutes in that 24 hours. This problem has continued and since it is now way beyond the very limited 30 day refund policy of Amazon, I am stuck with as I said earlier "" Just a piece of worthless junk"" This is probably the fastest that I have just thrown away about $100 for a purchase from Amazon. Never again. Any future purchases from Amazon, if there is any, will be examined closely within the 30 day period and determined if it is the quality I expect from a company like Seiko and Amazon."
5,Fast Shipping & Good DVD Quality!!!,I received my DVD Order in time and in good condition!!! This is a good Seller with Fast Delivery Speed!!!
3,Less than I'd hoped for,"Must admit that I was OK with Anne of the Thousand Days, but the Mary, Queen of Scots film was just drudgery. I was unimpressed with the pace of the film. I have read considerably about Tudor England and the rivalry between Elizabeth and Mary. Glenda Jackson was impressive as Elizabeth I, but Vanessa Redgrave was a snore. Each movie takes poetic license, but I would recommend the 6 disc Elizabeth R for a more comprehensive look at the period or get the Tudors from Showtime."
4,"Love One Film, Unimpressed with the Other","In ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" Genevive Bujold's interpretation of the 16th century seductress, turned queen, Anne Boleyn, is passionate and multifaceted. Bujold has just the right chemistry with her costar, Richard Burton, who brilliantly portrays the notorious King Henry VIII. It takes no effort at all to imagine Bujold and Burton as the couple whose turbulent love affair and subsequent marriage significantly altered the course of history. ""Anne of the Thousand Days"" is a fascinating and emotionally gripping film, well directed, superbly cast, and beautifully filmed. This film is a must see wheather you're a history buff or not. ""Mary Queen of Scots"" was a disappointment. It dragged, lacked focus, and it was difficult to relate to the central characters.Jennifer K. LaffertyAuthor of Offbeat Love Stories and More"
5,Fun to watch,"For those who are fans of this time period, these two films are very good. As with all things, they play with history a bit but the acting is good, the scenery is fabulous, and they were very entertaining."
4,"Anne is worth it, but Mary is not....","I bought this movie because I'd been looking for Anne of the Thousand Days for quite some time on DVD. I knew I already loved the actors and actresses and the whole film in general, but I wasn't too sure about Mary, Queen of Scots. So since it was a dual package, I opted to go ahead and watch it. First, I'll list the positives. The musical score is wonderful and it really gave the film an epic feel, something the stars in it should have been able to do as well but fell short. I felt no sense of sympathy for Mary (Redgrave), in fact I didn't much care for her before. After watching this movie, I like her even less. Redgrave to me can't hardly act but at least she's attractive. Dalton too quickly goes from sweetheart to major jerk...and when did they even have time for a courtship considering they were married in the next 10 minutes of the movie? My honest opinion, buy this set for Anne of the Thousand Days. Watch Mary, Queen of Scots if you're really bored."
3,"Liked Mary Queen of Scots, not so much Anne Boleyn film","I really enjoyed Mary Queen of Scots. I've read books and seen many films from Queen Elizabeth I side, but never from Mary's side. It's nice to get a different view on this very interesting time in history. This was a very good movie.I can't say the same for Anne of a Thousand Days. Richard Burton played a great Henry, but the movie is too sympathetic in its portrayal of Anne Boleyn. They make her out to be simply a victim when she herself was a very ruthless ambitious woman guilty of many evil acts. The movie isn't bad, but I just couldn't get past the unrealistic character they made Anne to be."
5,Very entertaining,"The recent interest in the Tudors had me go back to see this classic, a wonderful performance by Vanessa Redgrave in the title role, with Glenda Jackson, Elizabeth I the rival queen, Timonty Dalton, her second husband, Patrick McGoohan, her scheming illegitimate brother, Nigel Davenport as the blunt Bothwell, her third husband, and a host of other British acting talent. Mary was misguided and not always the nicest person, but the performance is truly stunning. Great stuff!Anne of A Thousand Days, a great performance by both leads, especially Burton, an you can see wher the Tudors staff got their ideas from with this film. She is a bit less than fascinating her and far more manipulative than they give her credit for in the miniseries, and the film does not explain why they went 'off the boil' so quickly, but Burton was a titan and the dialogue is very racy and compelling for a movie of the time."
3,anne of the thousand days,"this video was in region 1 format, i.e. US. This cannot be played in Europe, which is region2. Amazon should ensure international customers are supplied wih the proper format or notified of this fact."
2,Neither Film That Good,"Bad history set aside, neither film was that interesting.The acting and scripts were mediocre. At any point in either film, you could turn off the television and mow the lawn, and not miss a beat. Top rated acting talents were wasted in both films.Two Stars for costumes.Watch Showtime's ""The Tudors"" instead -- bad history, but excellent acting and excellent scripts."
4,Mary reigns!,"Like many others, I have been waiting for ""Mary"" to come to DVD for several years. Both of these films take liberties with history, for example, Mary and Elizabeth never met, but they are superbly acted. Glenda Jackson is the very best as Elizabeth I and Vanessa Redgrave holds her own as the English queen's nemisis. ""Anne"" is also an entertaining film. Burton and Bujould are also great to watch as they go to war over who will get the crown upon Henry's death."
4,Good Cartoon,"I watched this cartoon in my 20's, it was pretty good, was cool hearing big stars voices on temporary characters. Mark Hamill was the Joker, yes, Luke Skywalker as the Joker!"
4,about time!!!!!,"since transformers,and gi joe cartoons have there been any better than this.this is a great cartoon with good animation, and no corny storylines.can't wait for the next dvd. oh and luke skywalker as joker's voice- you cant beat that!!"
4,The saturday morning cartoon of dreams!,"I started watching this on saturday mornings ages ago and i loved it, when i heard that it was coming to dvd i was exstatic!I quickly went out and bought it and boy i wasn't dissapointed.the acting was fantastic, kevin conroy being better than val kilmer, michael keaton and george clooney at being batman and mark hamill suitably maniacal as the joker and the artwork is gorgeous!Only 2 bad things about the DVD, 1)The amount of episodes, i need much more than 5! 2)The amount of extras, the introduction by Bruce Timm is insightful, but the how to draw batman is just lame! we may as well just copy the front cover.Overall this DVD is worth every penny and it's not just for kids, unless your parents are villians!"
3,Great Stories - DVD extras are no good.....,"It is about time that WB came out with some of the animated series! The stories are among the best tales of the Dark Knight! The DVD extras however leave ALOT to be desired. The game that is on there is a joke, and the only bigger joke is the ""how to draw batman segment"" which was horrible.Despite the DVD extra ""jokes"" that are on there, I would say that this is a must for any bat-fan."
2,"Great Series, Weak DVD with only 5 of the first episodes","This includes merely the first 5 episodes in the Batman: Animated Series. The series gets better as time goes on, but having the first 5 is kind of interesting. They were just getting started here, so I thought the animation was choppy, and I enjoyed just 2 of the 5 tales, the other 3 are pretty basic plots. The extras on this disc aren't even worth mentioning, one is a mindless game for kids, the type seen in 5 dollar DVDs and the other is very brief video showing you how they draw Batman's face. I disliked the stories with Scarecrow, Poison Ivy and the Man-Bat, the other two are with the Joker and thankfully are better quality, thanks to great writing and Mark Hamill's voice talent as Joker. Hopefully, new B:TAS DVDs will be out sooner and include more for our money."
3,Attention! this not a kids cartoon!,"this dvd includes five episodes from Batman the animated series. the villains are man-bat, joker, scarecrow, and poison ivy.the 1st episode introduces man-bat. really bad. it has no story.2nd episode is my favorite. it has both the joker and robin. mark hamill's joker is'nt half bad.3rd episode has scarecrow. it aint bad, sorta.4th also has joker and is pretty good.5th has poison ivy. do not watch this one!conclussion. not that great. The music stunk and it was too violent.The main drawback is poison ivy. she wears revealing clothing and kisses both batman and harvey dent. also batman kicks her, pretty violent. you should not buy this unless you are content with the joker episodes."
1,"Inaccurate as can be, but entertaining anyway.","The authors of this book most definitely need to do more research because they alone are unable to keep dates and names correct. All the other ""Encyclopedias"" are able to at least know what they are talking about. These guys also need an editor worth at least minimum wage. The one they hired for this book was not doing very much to correct anything that needed it."
2,Needs More Work,"Lane and Gregg's book is nice if you want something to carry around everywhere you go, but it is poorly edited and/or poorly researched (for instance, Herman Webster Mudgett was hung on May 7th, not May 27th). There is also too much of an emphasis on murderers whom I wouldn't immediately title ""serial killers,"" such as Adolfo Constanzo and Dr. Thomas Neill Cream. The writing is about average and overall the Schecter and Newton books are better references for those interested."
4,Pretty good...,"Instead of just giving to eye candy and ""big names"" in the field of serial murderers, this book gives close to about a 100 or so ""others"", and their crimes...pretty good."
1,worst book ever,I found this book to give some false information and mix up the stories. the dates and names are wrong..needless to say i was dissapointed.
2,This is a WARNING!,"If you are buying this book for reading in your Spanish class, this is probably NOT THE WAY TO GO. It may be a good price, but the other version is the one that contains the study questions and is abridged appropriately for learning the language.Simply if you're buying this book for the fun if it, then yes... it would be the way to go but I spend money on this thinking it was the correct one for class and it wasn't. MAKE SURE YOU CHECK with your teacher prior to purchasing this copy!!"
1,LIE,"THIS IS NOT A SPANISH AND ENGLISH EDITION. It is all in Spanish, which minimal English, which is only used to explain directions or exercises. Not worth it."
5,PROTECTION,This item is what it says. It has the disable pin for the ultimate protection. It is handheld and usable and creates a great item for the security of yourself.
3,Blurry at best.,"If you don't mind a blurry picture and really blurry when any one moves then this is for you! However, if you can get the people in the picture to sit perfectly still in is fine, but then that is just like looking at a picture. There is a delay and the ability to see anyones mouth move is random at best. We have it hooked to a good phone line and my son, who has the other one, also has his hook up to a good phone line. I can't imagine what you'd see if your phone line was iffy."
1,DO NO BUY THIS,PLEASE Do not buy this item is very bad because they tell you that it works and is not true i got it and did not work at all and them when i returned they keep 15% of the price so for that experiment i lost like $80 with S&H.;if you do not want to lose your money do not try it
1,Product did not work,This was a replacement for a Vialta Beamer that was damaged. The same product we odered from this site however did not work.
3,Not Bad For the Total Beginner,"If you are interesting in exotic dance but are totally new to dance fitness, this dvd may be for you. It is easy, slow-paced and is a nice introduction to exotic dance. I enjoy using it when I am tired & not in the mood for an intense workout but still want to get some practice in for the day.There are a few moves I really like, like the ""Sunrise"". I also appreciate Felinity's attention to detail, like maintaining a continuous flow of movement and reminding the viewer to ""follow a path"" with the hands. It is little movements like this that make an otherwise ordinary exercise ""sexy.""However, if you have dance experience, are in great shape already or certainly if you have experience in any form of exotic dance, skip it. There are much better DVDs out there on this subject, and this one certainly won't advance your practice. At best, it's a nice way to relax at the end of a long day."
4,DB,"Nice book of DB, he is an inspirational chef whose work I am fond of. This book (though a bit out dated) is really cool, the bread recipes are classic."
1,Don't waste your money,"I expected a lot form this book, as Mr. Boulud's previous book was very good. But this one is not so much a book of recipes or cooking techniques as it is a lot of pictures of wine bottles, Mr.Boulud's daily life and so on. Also, a lot of pages made up of huge fonts which say too little but look too much. Recipes are not good at all, if you can find any. For example between pages 240 and 260 there is no single recipe but a lot of photographs of everything except recipes. I personally wouldn't give a try to any one of his recipes. The price for this book should be no more than $5. Hence, please don't waste your money."
5,Good stuff,"If you want some good stuff for background, light sorta swing jazz, and light listening then this CD is very good.Listening to it on Amazon clears all doubt as to the value of it to your collection.Buy it.This CD is a fit to my collection.When is comes on my guests want to know who the artist is and where I purchased the CD."
3,Not bad - Not Great!,"this case is a pretty good fit, but the clip likes to dig into your side when wearing it (if you have even the least amount of love handles!).The plastic that covers the screen gets smudged easily and it makes it difficult to see the display unless its perfectly clean. My biggest problem with it is that the tiny little slide clip on the back that connects the clip assembly to the case is flimsy and will break easily. that being said, I believe I recall a good warranty on the product, but cannot find anything online about how to claim warranty repair/replacement (even from SFPlanet webpage). Will likely buy another type of holder. if you're more careful than I, it would be a pretty good holster. Best for women I supposed since they have a purse to put it in."
3,"Best I have found, not perfect","Case did not exactly fit my W600i, although it was the correct style case. I actually had to trim it a bit*, and the top snap strap is extremely tight, so it's a PITA when you do have to open and close the phone, which luckily for me, isn't that often.That being said, it is the best case I have found for the phone, and after the trim fits pretty well. All the controls are accessible, and all the features useable (except the keypad) with the case on, all plugs and ports are also accessible, but the screen is protected.*What I had to trim were clear plastic side panels. This may be operator error, as the fit of the case is definitely not intuitive, and it may be that I just couldn't properly interpret the instructions."
3,Great music but poor recording,I enjoyed the music on this CD a lot. It is very good. But the quality of the recording surprised me. It is like a poor quality bootleg. It would be great if it could be remasterd.
1,Picture is soft !,"I have been very happy with my HD DVD purchases so far (> 10 titles), but this is a real disappointment. The picture is soft and it doesn't look like HD at all. I wish I could return it. Don't buy this if you are expecting HD sharpness."
3,"Less history, more human interest","This is a well-photographed look into modern Chinese culture with a focus on human-interest-style narratives. It follows a gymnast, window-washer as (to lesser degrees) policewoman, master bow-maker, rice farmer and Kung-Fu instructor - and examines the diversity of their daily lives. While there is some exploration of the wealth of natural and man-made majesty of China (the great Wall, the Dragon's Back, the Forbidden City), this is not the focus of this film. If you are expecting a geographical tour, with a history lesson and insight into the enormous cultural diversity of this country, this is not the place. But it is an engaging exploration of modern lifestyle and ambition, giving the viewer a glimpse into the lives of diverse people, along with their motivations and aspirations. I would buy it again, but it leaves so much unanswered that additional titles are warranted."
4,Not bad,Overall not bad. But not much scenery of the China's. There are stories about different people. Wished it had more native sceneries.
2,Disappointing,"I was expecting a little better production than this. With the vast area that is encompassed by China, with its ancient culture and history; one would have anticipated more coverage of that rather than the excessive coverage of the country yokel who seeks his fortune in the big city and the young female olympic hopeful. Also, I have to agree with the other reviewer about the quality of the picture. Perhaps after watching Planet Earth I'm a bit spoiled; but I didn't think this dvd deserved to be advertised as high definition .Finally, I wouldn't purchase this dvd if given the chance to do it over again."
5,Great for Classes,"All the Discovery Atlas videos are great classroom resources for Current Events or World Affairs teachers, but Discovery Atlas China is one of the best of the series. I prefer the longer versions of the videos over the condensed ones included on the compilation. Due to the Discovery Atlas format of shared individual stories, my students are able to make a ""personal"" connection with the subjects they can't get from regular travel videos. The high-definition production and videography also adds to the ""wow"" factor of these videos as well."
3,This puzzles me because....,"This China Revealed DVD price is pricier than the set of 4-DVD containing this exact DVD, The set is called Discovery Atlas (2006); and while you are paying less, you'll get this DVD separately + 3 other DVDs about Italy, Brazil, Australia (revealed). They come in different covers and are included in the brown leathered-like boxset. China must be the desired country right now for American public?"
4,Discovery China HD Blue-ray Dvd,This is an inspiring movie. Different from other travel movies with the way the lives of several people are followed makes this more emotional and satisfying. The scenery is so beautiful and I felt like I was actually there. It is a place I had wanted to see but not visit so this is definitly the way to go.
2,Disappointing,"Having traveled to China 10 times in the past 8 years, I was eager to show family and friends some of the places I have been. I expected much more footage of the Great Wall. I spent 5 hours walking on the wall...China Revealed spent about 5 minutes covering the Great Wall. A large part of China Revealed was about a young Chinese athelete and her hopes of winning Gold for China in the 2008 Olympics and of a window-washer in Beijing and his travels home for Chinese New Year. Both were interesting segments, but not what you expect in a high definition disc. If I had had the opportunity to preview China Revealed before buying, I would not have purchased it."
1,not beautiful,"this should probably get 2 stars, but i gave it only 1 in order to warn people that there is almost no scenery in this film, and very few of the breath-taking locations china has. it's almost all people eating, talking, and doing gymnastics. not what i was looking for."
3,Outstanding,"This is an outstanding video, I seen it on TV a few years back and wanted to show my wife how the West views China. Impressive.It would of been nice if in the description that the HD video is only playable on HD DVD players."
3,Expected more .,"Even though the approach is interesting, I expected to see more about historical and natural places. It focuses too much in the life of the persons they chose to be interviewed."
2,Extremely disappointing!,"I've loved Bosom Buddies since the instant it was first broadcast in 1981, and was overjoyed to discover the show was finally out on DVD. However, this package is highly disappointing, almost to the point that I considered returning it. Not only is the original opening music gone, but so is the narrative which explained the premise of the show. Pieces of dialogue, and in some cases entire scenes, are missing. The packaging is spare ... OK, it's cheap ... and there is no bonus anything.Frankly, the occasional reruns on TBS are better than this DVD set."
3,Did Bosom Buddies Meet My Expectations?,"That was the question posed by Amazon. I was expecting a DVD copy of an old TV series, which is what I received so I guess it met my expectations. However, when this series was on TV, the opening theme song of the second season was ""My Life,"" sung by Billy Joel. This set does not have that theme song."
5,Favorite TV show,My husband and I loved watching this TV show when we were first married.I decided to surprise him this Christmas with the DVD set so we could enjoywatching it again.Thanks!
2,Missed it so much...until I got it again!,"I remembered this show fondly for so long and so I bought the set. Really, who doesnt love Tom Hanks? But from the very opening, the theme song ""My Life"" by Billy Joel is gone, and so is the magic. Would I have still loved this set if it opened with the same theme? I am thinking yes, by the time I figured out why it seemed so wrong, I couldnt get past the disapointment....poor me"
5,A great buy!,I bought this dresser along with another piece that matches it and I get tons of compliments on it! It looks great and I'll be able to use it for a long time. It was fairly easy to put together and is very sturdy.
4,My past live..,"In my past life I was Ms. Brooks. I was born in 1873 and died in 1933. I had 3 children. I died at an earlier age due to radariation. I know live in the body of man named Gregory Morrison. Mr. Morrison had not idea that I was in the light before and now here. I have waited for the right moment to let him know this. Mr. Morrison is handing everything very well. I hope that he will achieve those things in his life time that I did not or was not able to achieve. Mr. Morrison is married and has 2 children of his own. His children are from the light too. We come back and forth from the world sometime only once but sometimes 2 or 3 times in our new life or heavely place. Again it is nice to be able to walk on the earth and see and do those things that I never really had the the chance to do. Driving a new car, having the proper medical care when needed, cable TV, and just a better life totally. Once again thank you for reading this letter and may you travel in peace too. Ms. Brooks"
4,Works,"I used this mask while laying down 3 coats of varathane on a 500 sq ft floor over 3 different days. I used it with the organic vapor filters and it was comfortable and while it was on I never smelled that nasty stuff at all.I took away one star because initially they sent me the wrong size (medium). But Amazon made it right by refunding my money. I ordered it again from the same company and they finally sent the correct size (small). I am not a very small person (5'8"") but by having a narrow face a small fits me better."
3,OK,"This respirator is ok. It gets hot, but part of that could be the filters that we were using. It fit my wife well and was easy to put on and off. The filters were also easy to place and remove."
1,WASTE of Money,I bought this book for my kids and it was a complete and total waste of time and money. The advice is as shallow as it is boring.My wife hated it. My kids couldn't relate to a single tip the 'author' offered.Save your money and look to better authors than Searls.
4,pretty solid,"This year's Best American Mystery Stories is a pretty good collection of stories. In fact, most of the stories are pretty good--we've all the usual suspects in this volume. I'll say the best two stories in the collection are by two Christophers, Chambers and Cook. This is a good collection to read."
4,Variety pack,"I like to pass time on my lunch hour with books on CD, and this one is a gem because of the variety of stories."
2,Where are the mysteries?,"While I like Connelly's work, this collection he edited seems flat like a day-old warm Coke: there is no mystery to it, as if the entire mystery short story genre got swallowed up by the procedural and thriller aspects of that style. There's plenty of following the numbers and pursuing bad guys, and violence and murder and mayhem, but little to tickle the brain. That absence gets overshadowed by character drama and interpersonal politics, and it made me long for the short stories of Dashiell Hammet or Agatha Christie, each of which had its own conceptual mystery that required the reader to concentrate in order to understand. This book of short stories passes like watching television in the lounge of a car dealership."
1,"Gum, yes, price no!",At the time of this writing the 3-pack is almost $13 dollars. I would be a moron to buy at this price when I can buy it for $2.88 per unit at my local grocery store.
4,Good book,"Good book if you are interested in Bush Pilots in Alaska and flying.Don Sheldon was a fearless, dedicated pilot."
3,Factual Errors,"The most glaring factual error is the date of Stub Morrison's death. Greiner places Stub's death over 1.5 years earlier, ironically using the date of Glen Hudson's death for Stub Morrison. Glen Hudson operated Hudson Air Service with his younger brother Cliff Hudson. They were operating in Talkeetna before Stub Morrison and Don Sheldon showed up, and went into business competing with the Hudsons. Check the old newspapers-- PBS made a documentary about Don Sheldon and it included the falsehoods printed in Wager With The Wind. Considering all the stories about the bitter rivalry between Sheldon and Cliff Hudson (many rumors surround the circumstances of Glen's death and some point to Morrison and Co. as a suspect) I find it hard to believe that this 'fact' of Morrison's death went unresearched, and it perpetuates a cover up of history by the series of biographers."
3,Another Romance Author Goes Formulaic....,"Guhrke's work is getting steadily less original and decidedly more within the standard romance formula. As I got further and further into this novel, my interest kept waning because I felt I could exactly chart the course of events in the story: Hero spy and heroine counter spy, during American Revolution, work at cross purposes and then same purposes while they fall in love. Guhrke's earlier work, especially CONOR'S WAY, and secondly, BREATHLESS, were a lot more original. Unfortunately, many romance readers buy the formula romance again and again without any boredom factor setting in to ruin it for them. I wish I were one of them but, alas, the formula is really grating upon me at this point. Guhrke's a good writer but needs a better mouse trap IMHO."
3,Hmm...,"I've read several Guhrke novels, and I find her inconsistant. One book will be great. One will be so-so. This book just never captured my imagination the way I hoped it would."
5,A terrific find,I came across this book and decided to buy it. I loved the cover it looked like a nice summer read. I know this is a cliche but I couldn't put it down. Once I started it I was hooked. It was very quick getting into this book and I loved every page. The characters were fun and the story line was interesting. I read it in less than 48 hours that is how engrossed I was. I highly recommed it to anyone looking for something good to read. Very enjoyable.. like I said a perfect summer read. Enjoy! I can't wait until her next book.
5,"Easy to follow, step by step with color photographs.",I really like this book. It is so simple to understand. It has real life photographs showing exactly how to do it yourself. I am a woman and find it hard to find a book that makes it so simple. It is well worth it's price considering the money you save by doing it yourself. I checkeed it out at the library but will be purchasing my own for sure!
2,"Decent gift, not great","I bought this as a gift for a co-worker, and she told me her family enjoyed the cheese a lot. That said, I was disappointed with this as a gift, as the box was much smaller than I expected and the unattractive, very loose ribbon made a weak presentation. (I couldn't re-tie the ribbon or even remove it, since it was attached with a sticker to the box and would have ended up tearing the box.) Overall, I won't be buying this as a gift again - better to find a great local cheese shop and wrap everything properly."
4,decent effort by jefferson airplane alumni,"the song selection and guitar playing on this is superb. Jorma's vocals tend to get a little monotonous. My favorite track on here is called Down and Out also, a great rendition of the old Jefferson Airplane chestnut, Embryonic Journey. A nice CD to ""chill-out"" to"
2,did not deliver the goods,"""A Distant Crossing"" was a decent read, but did not deliver the goods. It was promoted as an apocalyptic drama, but spent almost no time describing the apocalypse and almost all of the book on the personal experience of the protagonist, making the book a dramatic personal story, but lacking the broader scope of quality apocalyptic fiction like ""Patriots"" or ""One Second After""."
5,A page turner!,"This is one of the most exciting books I have read in a long time, I just couldn't put it down. I read the entire book in 3 sittings.Once you get involved with these characters and the situations they find themselves in, you cannot tear yourself away!The action never stops.Several co-workers were reading this book at the same time and we had daily discussions on what actors could portray these characters in the movie version.We could definitely see this being turned into an action-packed thriller! Tom Parks did an incredible job with this book. I've recommended "" A Distant Crossing"" to anyone who'll listen...I can't say enough good things about it!"
2,Okay but not a page turner,An okay read nothing great or bad. It's what I would call a middle middling book.There are some good action scenes with the main character Jim seemingly partial terminator since he recovers from serious injuries with little more then alcohol and sewing needles.I found it a little difficult to believe the Mexicans in these dirt poor towns would be so nice and gracious to Jim and his Aussie friend instead of robbing and leaving them for dead in some ditch. Finally I wish the novel placed more action in the U.S. on the struggles Jim would face from the economic meltdown rather then time in some Mexican forced labor gold mine.The financial meltdown seems to have little mention and I was unsure why it was even added. Still I did find the book interesting enough to finish but it's not a page turner and likely will be forgotten soon enough. Also whats up with the odd size of the book? It does not effect the read just found it a little odd.
5,Wonderful Book!,"This book is a fabulous read and I could hardly put it down. It was very suspenseful, thrilling and believable. I highly recommend this very exciting book that had such a surprise at the end.I have bought 5 books myself to give out as gifts."
1,Worst book I've ever read,"Misspellings, typos, horrible writing. What's going on here? This has to be vanity press and the reviewers, (most of them) must be friends and relatives. Spend $5000 to get a book published, put it on Amazon and sell a zillion copies, and voila!... you just made a lot of money.Read the reviews and notice how similar expressions occur in many of them. Maybe the author wrote them all. Don't waste your money. I did."
1,Keyless Entry Remote Fob Clicker for 2002 Toyota Avalon,"The clicker will not work. We tried the directions sent to us many times without luck. I took the clicker by Toyota to get it re- programed. No luck. They put it into their computer and it is the wrong one. It looks like it, they said, but it is the wrong one, I think it has to do the trunk part. Our clicker doesn't look like that. Wish it had worked. Have to send back."
2,Not what it should be,"While this book does provide some helpful information on some of Dylan's lesser known work, anyone familiar with the more well-known Dylan (i.e. the mid-60s Dylan, the Blood on the Tracks Dylan, the Time out of Mind/Love and Theft Dylan) won't find much new information there. Varesi's take on Time out of Mind is laughably one-dimensional. And his misreading of ""Leopard-skin Pill-box Hat"" is ridiculous. Does anyone really think that song's about a hat? Come on now.This book is worth reading for those of us who need to take a second look at some of the lesser known albums, but it is by no means an authoritative or important work of scholarship on Dylan"
4,Well constructed,I received the bag promptly and the bag is made well enough to trust it holding a fairly expenses camera and lenses.
2,awkward for use,"I find that the bag is awkward because of the buckle--it is difficult to open quickly to retrieve my wallet, etc. I like the look, but it's not an ""easy"" bag to use."
2,A So-So Messenger Bag,"Relatively small, doesn't hold a lot in the main compartment and the side pockets are only big enough for a cell phone or a pair of shades and nothing else. Otherwise, the construction is sturdy. Just don't expect much utilitarian value."
5,Great go-bag,"I was looking for a go-bag that I could keep packed with my essential gear for business trips, whether it be a day of meetings in the city or one of my frequent flights. This does the trick. I've stocked the pockets with the chargers, earbuds, analgesics and other stuff I like to have handy. There's still ample room in the main compartment for my iPad, a magazine and a paperback. (It's not big enough for my laptop, but I've pretty much stopped traveling with that anyway.) The shoulder strap is adjustable to a comfortable length for me. The main flap closes with a secure buckle and there's a zippered compartment for wallet and phone, so I don't worry about stuff falling out. If you're looking for a handy go-bag, this does the trick."
4,ok,"More like a purse then a real messenger bag really; a merse, if you will. One regular 8/11 folder extends it to max, and makes it uncomfortable. Neat little pockets, but if you're looking for something to carry lunch, your water, documents, etc. this is not it. This is more, ""hey I'm going to a show and i want my camera, a water bottle and a couple other small things on me"" type bag."
2,Urban Explorer Black Canvas Shoulder Bag,"It is a nice bag, however, was not what I was looking for.Had lots of little pockets, but not very useful in that respect.More like a map bag, not very secure.I did, however, like the fact it was lightweight and durable.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014LTYQK/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
2,Needs improvement,"Although this bag is just the perfect size and the strap is adjustable, nothing else seems to work for me. The main compartment doesn't zip or button or velcro and the flap doesn't keep my things in. For instance, my wallet came flying out the side...not good. Just glad there are still some honest people out there. The pocket on the flap ripped the first day. Not just a little rip...3/4 up the flap. Thank goodness I had nothing in it. The small compartments on the front are really useless. A package of gum won't stay in the compartments.The look of the bag in really great, but the overall functionality of the bag is not as rugged as one would think."
5,Great man bag!,"I purchased this for my father-in-law who is a school bus driver. He wanted a bag that he could carry all his junk in but didn't want something that looked like a purse or a backpack. I found this online and loved it right when I saw it out of the box. The fabric is extremely durable and ""manly"". It is smaller than I thought it would be but is just the right size for a work bag. I stuffed it full of snacks and fun stuff and according to my mother-in-law, he loves it. He's a hard one to please so that's a great sign."
3,Bag review,"Good quality bag at a good price, however much smaller that I thought. I'm sure it gave the measurements somewhere and I just didn't read them properly but ordered this for my husband to use as a ""messenger"" type bag but due to the size looks like a purse. I was thinking it was at least laptop sized. Needless to say he won't be using it, but i'm keeping it to use as a small diaper bag when i don't feel like lugging the big one around."
4,Good basic bag,"This is a good simple, basic bag.I did mod the one I received by carefully removing the two small pockets and the ID slot on the front using a razor knife. This makes the bag a bit less 'busy' and the flap is easier to close.The only 'con' for this item is the interior liner. The fabric is fairly heavy; seems more than it really needs to be.If you're looking for something to use as a basis to build into a specific use, this might be a good choice. The price is low enough, so if you have a 'fail', not too much is lost! :)+1 - the bag is made in India - not China.==-= January 2013 updateGot tired of the interior liner and removed most of it. I did leave the portion that contained the zipper pocket. As a bonus, this also reduced the bag weight.So far, so good."
3,Rothco urban explorer,"The fron clip is not well made, it is hard to open. It has a feel of chip plastic, but overall it is a good value for the price."
3,Short Strap,"Seems well constructed, and I like the variety of pockets. But the strap is too short to be really comfortable for me as a messenger bag, which is what I wanted. I'm keeping it, because I'm running out of time before a trip to NY, but I'm disappointed. What would it really have taken to put a few extra inches on the strap? It's adjustable, and then it would be easier to fit everyone. And unfortunately the strap is attached directly to the bag so I can't just replace that."
5,Wish I could give it SIX stars!,"Very well made, surprisingly roomy, incredible number of USABLE pockets! Inside, outside, in the front flap, on the back, etc., etc. Only possible negative is the lack of a handle, it has an adjustable shoulder strap that is akward to use to pick it up, move it around. I highly recommend this, great bag for the price!"
3,Historical Romance,"This just doesn't quite come up to what I expect from Jeanette Baker, not sure what is missing but something lacking. I wonder maybe if this is older book and she's improved in her story telling since writing this novel."
5,Great Album!,"I remember buying this on vinyl in Montreal on my eighth grade class trip. The hits were beginning to fade out in the USA but I still had to have it. It is one of those albums where every track is excellent. I can't wait to hear it remastered on disc. My favorite--""My Old Piano"". Hearing it never gets old."
5,brings back memories,"I saw the albumn cover (that sounds funny now) and I had to have it. The music keeps me singing, and tapping my feet...my favorite us Have Fun."
1,Not the correct book,I ordered this book as a Mentor Book as stated in the description and the picture to replace a damaged book in the mentor line of a three part series. I was sent a completley different verstion of the book. Even the order slip said it was to be a mentor. This is the second time in a short period where i have not been delivered what was purchasesd. Obvious mistake on sender.
2,Very Disappointed,"With the star rating of this seller I expected a much better product, the book was yellowed and musty smelling. I also paid for expedited delivery because my daughter had a school project due and it took two and a half weeks for it to be delivered as opposed to four days for the other book to arrive that I ordered at the same time. Will think twice when on a deadline."
2,tiny print,"English is my first language but I have a working knowledge of Spanish. I have lived in Cali, Colombia, the home of the author, Jorge Isaacs, and have always wanted to read the beloved story, in Spanish, which is considered a national classic. However, when I received my copy of the book, I was susrprised to see that the font was so tiny. I am still, after several weeks, strugglilng to get through it. I'm not sure I'll finish it because the size of the print is so distracting which makes it especiallly difficult in a second language."
1,Seller was not reasonable,"The product was what I ordered. However, I ordered the wrong year.I looked up the seller's return policy and got in touch with them right away. They then told me I could NOT return it because the manufacturer went out of business. I told the seller that I didn't buy it from the manufacturer, I bought it from them and have followed their return policy.They didn't budge. I will never buy from this seller again, and I would suggest you not buy from them either."
1,Parts missing,Yellow paint was missing which is necessary to complete task. Re-ordered same thing since I didn't keep order info. Hope it has all components to complete my job.
2,car fabric repair,I am not pleased with the product - even with the color chart and following directions was unable to get the color to match - even a little. I mixed them several times. I don't have that hard of a color - just gray -
3,Worked so so,Was very hard to get the colors right however easy to use and my seat looks better them it did. Thais for the fast shipping.
2,You Have to Work It,"Not nearly as easy to work with as advertised. Of course, trying to work with tight fabric is tough, but we had no idea how tough it would be to repair the tears we had."
2,Not a good experience,"My GF burned a hole in my micro-fiber couch. I bought this for a fix, it was a fail. The adhesive is the bad part. It is what makes a stain on the fabric. Good luck with it if you buy it."
4,cloth seat repair seat,I used this product before but ran out and had to repurchase. Hard to find at retail and was happy to locate online. This is a great product and works perfect for cigarette burns in automobile seats or carpet.
4,"Easy to use and favorable end result, too!","This product was something about which I was hesitant before I used it. However, it really does everything it claims to do and is quick and easy to use. If there is any aspect of this product that is challenging, it is that it is the responsibility of the user to mix the perfect shade that will match your upholstery fabric. Granted, if your fabric is white or black, etc., then you have it easy. Mine is grey and I used the handy mixing chart, included in the purchase of the product. It looks pretty good...a far cry better than it did before I used the product. However, be sure that you are happy with your color match before you apply the color portion of this product. Otherwise, I am well pleased and find it to be a good purchase."
3,works ok,"For less than $10, you can't expect a perfect repair. This product is acceptable and the result is much, much better than the hole that was in the fabric."
3,Maybe you just have to be a pro at this.,I followed directions and ended up with a lighter version of my cigarette hole. I'm not sure if i didn't use enough glue or product but it did not end up how i was hoping. Good thing this was less than 20 bucks. I am saving this because i am hoping to figure it out.
3,Average performance,"We had a burn hole in a cloth seat and bought this product to fix it. Unfortunately, our seat was dual toned, so matching was impossible. We did the best we could and it looks better than before, but not as good as we had hoped it would."
4,very interesting account,"This is a well-written account of the evolution-ID battle in Dover, Pennsylvania. It is more even-handed than many accounts, and attempts to describe the personalities involved. More of a sociological and journalistic treatment than a biological or education one, but the story is well-told, gripping, and complicated nuances are explained clearly."
5,Seperation of Church and State: Still a Good Idea,"Monkey Girl presents a very good example of why ""seperation of church and state"" is so very important. In the Doover case a local school board (which was over powered by a couple strong members) tried to ram-rod thier very narrow religious ideas down the throats of a local community. The majority of the board members appeared to be uninformed about ID and evolution. Thier scientific witnesses were no better equipped (scientifically speaking) for a court battle. In the end the outcome was as it should be ""the seperation of church and state is sitll a good way to run a country""."
4,Little more proofreading and would have warranted 5 stars!,"Wonderful read but Edward, O'Reilly works for Fox News and it's Richard Dawkins not Robert.Page 224Within days after the lawsuit was filed, Bill O'Reilly, CNN's most popular and highest-paid pundit, dedicated a segment to the controversy in Dover.Last time I checked O'Reilly has never worked for CNN and works for Fox news.Page 237the Robert Dawkins Darwinists...referring to the auther of ""The God Delusion""It's Richard Dawkins.Just can't believe these weren't corrected before it went to print.Still a wonderful book about a very important topic."
4,somewhat light on legal analysis,"This book provides quite a lot of detail regarding the machinations of the school board and some of the main players in the ID movement, e.g., the Discovery Institute. It is, however, kind of slight when it comes to the law, with respect to both the existing precedent on the Establishment Clause and the procedural aspects of the trial. It's perfectly fine for a non-lawyer, but as a lawyer, I wanted a bit more."
4,A Scary Reality,... I read a lot of books but NEVER this type of book -- I usually go for books that are fun or mysterious but not terrifying. This book is extremely well written. Reading this book will change the way you look at things sometimes.This book scared me to death because it is true. I couldn't put it down.It's very graphic and the images pop in your head. I still didn't believe how deadly and scary these viruses are. Richard Preston did a good job of describing every little detail of the virus.
5,Buy This Book!,"This is a must buy book, no matter what subject you are interested in. If I were a high school orcollege instructor I would make this book mandatory reading for my classes. Maybe this true storyof the Ebola virus will wake up our future generation's mindset and help guide the world in a betterecological direction."
3,A bit anticlimactic (fortunately),"Scary topic, especially because this is non-fiction. Well written (although it does begin to drag about the middle). Of course, none of the feared biological disasters ever actually happen (fortunately), so the whole book is a bit anticlimactic. If you're interested the Ebola virus, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, it's nothing to rush out and buy.Not bad but not recommended."
4,frightening,"what was truly frightening about this book wasn't the virus (though it is terrifying in itself), but was the infighting and politics and non-cooperation of the army, cdc, and the private company. if this had been a more dangerous virus, then much damage would have been done.the book itself was decently written, but don't buy it for the writing, but it for the education."
5,AMAZING BOOK!!!!!!!!,"It is one of the best books i have read. It is so exciting and the best part is, IT IS REAL AND IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!!!!!"
1,"Interesting subject matter, disappointing execution...","After having heard many good things about this book, I finally decided to give it a try. The subject matter was both fascinating and frightening. However, I found that I was too often distracted by the redundant and heavy-handed nature of the prose. e.g. ""The kill rate in humans infected with Ebola Zaire is nine out of ten. Ninety percent of the people who come down with Ebola Zaire die of it. Ebola Zaire is a slate wiper in humans."" Passages like the one quoted above reduced my overall enjoyment of the book. In the end, I thought that the book was pretty disappointing."
2,What a disappointment,"This is the first ""techno thriller"" I have read. And I took a great care at investigating if it was worth the read. From all the positive reviews I thought that it was worth a try. Then I read... Oh my God. What a disappointment! So badly written, so badly structured and conceived. Besides some scanty but interesting information on the Ebola virus, the rest of the book reads like a bad B movie. The writer is desperately trying to ""grip"" you, to ""shock"" you with action and non-existent intrigue.What a waste... are all ""techo thrillers"" like this? I thought this one was among the best..."
5,An amazing and suspenseful must read,"This book was thoroughly enjoyable, although at times it was scary and gory. However, i really loved reading it and learning how the Marburg and Ebola viruses affected people without reading a boring textbook. I'm sure you would enjoy it as much as i did."
5,Great Book,This was a great book by a great author... I first read this book in 1996 at my dads house and I was scared of Ebola for 5 years after that... So as you can see it is a very realistic and good story that scared me a lot!
3,Redundance,"A summary of ""the Hot Zone"": Ebola and Marburg viruses are really scary and if they spread across the world it would wipe out the world.That's about all the book tells you...just with different examples. Interesting for the first 75 pages...but after that its just same old story different day."
5,"Excellent, excellent book!","A truly terrifying account of what lurks on the edges of the world. The story might have been a bit better with more explosions and car chases, though...."
4,The Hot Zone,"""The Hot Zone"", by Richard Preston, is based on a true story and is a chilling account of the Ebola virus as it is tracked from a small cave in Africa to a monkey house in Virginia. The cast of characters consists of higher ops in the military to a group of scientists trying not only to find where the virus started, but also a way to get rid of it. Preston tells of how the virus literally feeds off the victim's flesh as they perish within days. He also tells of the fight between the CDC, (Center for Disease Control), and the military. Therein lies the problem of who has the right to contain the disease as it slowly spreads with no end in sight. I feel this is a good book because it tells of brave people in a frantic struggle to cure a disease that could wipe out an entire population. If you like sci-fi/horror books, i suggest you read ""The Hot Zone""."
2,Stilted And Artificial,"Richard Preston is a writer. This is how he writes. He writes choppy sentences. His sentences are short. He writes ten short sentences to make one point. He repeats things. He writes a story about a virus. The virus is what the story is about. A virus is a germ that can people or animals sick. Sometimes it makes animals sick. Sometimes it makes humans sick. Richard Preston wants to tell you about the Ebola virus. And if the writing in this review looks good to you, maybe you will be able to finish the book rather than heave it across the room in frustration."
2,Terrifying... sometimes,"The first part of the book when Charles Monet goes to Kitum cave and get the Marburg virus is a good book, but after that the book keeps repetitive and goes out of the story so many times that is very difficult to finish it... but I did, the main story, the research of the Ebola, the way they keep everything in secret and how they work with the wild monkeys is very interesting if you can find that story (this book could be written with 150 pages less), but at the end of the book you will be as at first, nothing can be done against these two virus."
3,"A review Of ""The Hot Zone""","""The Hot Zone"" By Richard Preston, I found to be a Mediocre novel, parts of it were very interesting, and other parts of it was just plain boring, it was graphic in it's descriptions of the Ebola disease. Which can contribute to some wonderful writing, but then again it can also make one sick as they are reading it. I liked this novel at certain points when it was making sense. And I also did not like it when it brought up points that had nothing to do with the Ebola Virus, the Military, the CDC and the certain characters in the novel. So overall I give it a C."
3,good story; bad writing,"I, honestly, really enjoyed this book. But...I thought the writing was sub-par....almost too factual to even include the extras about peoples' personal lives (like the Jaax family). Preston also doesn't create vivid examples. He, at one point, discusses a virus likened to the island of Manhattan but doesn't put it in the right context for size. --Hence, in the end, the example is meaningless.Great book. Do read it. Just don't consider it literary gold."
3,"If not for anything, it is educational","Preston should be given a pat on the back for evidently working hard to investigate all the details of the Ebola outbreak.The narrative is generally engaging in the beginning but loss momentum along the way. The prose lacked the suspense generated by more distinguished authors of thrillers. The characters were not adequately developed and did not leave a lasting impression save the victims in the first half of the book. Nevertheless, the true account of the events alone will spur you on to the final pages.If not for anything, this book is educational and thus a worthwhile read."
4,An Intriguing Look Into the Future of Viruses in our World,"This is a very interesting and enjoyable book. I would recommend it to anyone looking for an enjoyable read, but who is not particularly intirested in the writing style of this novel. You could see either a strength or weakness in is its short, disconnected sentences. The novel is maninly objective, but the author resorts to giving his opinions on the subject at the very end which I found very eloquent and well written compared to the rest of the novel. However, the short, objectiveness of the sentence, although lacking a definite flow, added to the horrifing reality and the overall effect of the novel. I strongly urge anyone who is intirested in a graphic, exciting, and interesting account of the TRUE history behind the deadly filoviurses and the possibility of a major outbreak in the future to read to read this book. I guarentee you, your perspective on viruses and nature will change forever."
5,Excellent book!,"This is the best book I have ever read. It was so real and seemed like it was happening to you. It wasn't difficult to read and flowed easily. Some scenes are very gross, like when the people start to spit up blood and everything but it was a great book and I reccommend it to anyone and everyone. GRRRRREAT!!!"
4,Terrific book,I thought that The Hot Zone was a terrific non-fiction book. It was so graphic and descriptive that I felt I could actually see it happening. Richard Preston did a wonderful job in bringing such a deadly virus into my reality. It makes you wonder about what is really out there. Never again shall I take for granted the meaning of life.
2,Pandering to an audience.,"The author takes a non-event,and makes it into a best seller. Pretty impressive, huh? This is probably a good book if you know little about viruses, and can be impressed with learning some medicine. Unfortunately, I am a molecular biologist, and was already aware of the things that make this book interesting. That only left me with his plodding plot, and repetitive descriptions. If you want an exciting virus story, search out the book ""Fever! The Hunt for a New Killer Virus"" by John Fuller. It is much better written, more coherent, and more interesting. This is the story of the discovery of Lassa Fever in 1969, without the benefit of all the technology used in the Hot Zone, and it will have you on the edge of your seat if you are lucky enough to locate a copy. If you want to learn about medicine, read the Coming Plague. Although a little ponderous, it discusses many interesting diseases."
3,"Good story, bad writing","This book is getting 3 stars based solely on the story. It's a good thing the situation itself was interesting because the writing was lack luster. The author becomes almost obsessive with vocabulary words--once he introduces and explains them, he uses the words redundantly in the next 10 or so sentences--like a small child learning a new word. If you have any sort of biological background, be prepared to feel a little insulted. This goes beyond explaining simple concepts to laymen; at some points it feels almost condescending and patronizing.In all truth, the only reason I finished the book was because I knew it was a true story and once I pick up a book, I have to finish it.It's not worth the amount of money charged-find yourself a book written by a decent story teller."
3,Very informative,The book was very interesting and informative. Shortly after I read the book there was another outbreak of ebola in Africa. I paid very close attention to what was happening as a result of reading the book.
4,Captivating,"I had to read this book for school and was so scared to because it was really long. Well, I started reading it and liked it. There were some parts that it got boring but overall it was a very exciting book. It's just really weird to read this and think that something so horrible as the Ebola virus was in America. I learned a lot from this book and recommend it to people who like science related books."
5,Hard to put down!,"***** The dramatic and chilling story of an Ebola virus outbreak in a surburban Washington, D.C. laboratory, with descriptions of frightening historical epidemics of rare and lethal viruses. More hair-raising than anything Hollywood could think of, because it's all true .In the late 1980's at the Reston Primate Lab in Reston Va, Researchers suddenly realised that they had cases of Ebola infecting monkeys with a 90+% mortality rate. Then the virus did the impossible, It infected Monkeys in other parts of the lab... meaning it had gone airborne! An infectious disease ""Swat team"" rushed to the scene to try to contain the outbreak, but Suddenly, Lab workers began coming down with flu like symptoms!Our Government thought that the ""Slate wiper Virus"", the killer of all humanity, was about to be turned loose on the world... And they decided not to tell us! All True, written by a master of non-fiction. *****"
3,A little less filler please,"Hit and miss effort by Mr. Preston. The melting down and all around descriptions are the virus running amok are very interesting. However, the effort to tug at our heart strings is sloppy and manipulative and loses the focus of the book for the most part.Some of the writing seems a bit forced and therefore doesn't flow very well, but some is dead on...oh well just my opinion"
3,"Thoughtful, well-written real-life horror story","""The Hot Zone"" is an account of the origins and the sequence of events related to various outbreaks of Ebola. I think that the book overly dramatizes and exaggerates the consequences of filovirus infections. Consequently, the book reads like a thriller novel despite the author's claims that it is based on true stories. I agree with Stephen King that this is one of the most terrifying books I've read and is not for the weak of heart. Nevertheless, it's a pretty gripping read and is quite informative on basic layman Ebola virology."
4,A thrilling true story,"The Hot Zone is an engaging true story which reads like a work of fiction; often making it difficult to grasp the gravity of the situation presented. The chronology of the discovery (and sporadic outbreaks) of the filoviruses are presented in a well organized and entertaining manner. In some situations the description is a tad melodramatic, but the overall feeling is intriguing. My only serious critique Preston's description of the Ebola virus as a ""highly sophisticated organism"". Personally I don't there is a less accurate way to describe a virus than calling it that. Aside from that flaw, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in a thrilling nonfiction."
4,Good detail...when it wasn't overkill,"The subject matter of this book is very interesting, however, some parts of the book dwell on a particular fact for way too long. Overall, I rated this book a 7 because I couldn't put the book down, but yet I think it needs some polishing."
5,A Consuming Read!!!,"I devoured this book on a 2 1/2 hour flight from Salt Lake City to DFW....compelling, scary, and altogether a realistic scenario. Every time I step on a plane now I wonder...is there someone on this flight who is a carrier of a deadly virus? Definitely food for thought."
4,Engrossing and creepy,R. Preston really puts the Ebola and Marburg virus into complete perspective in terms of what effect it could potentially have on the world as we know it and what almost did happen to the world had a few situations not broke the right way. His writing and storytelling is superb albeit very repetitious at times. He constantly revisits what the virus can do and what it looks like. Very well done overall. I'd love to see this book about Ebola rewritten in 2009. How much would change and what has happened since then?
3,A deadly virus from Africa infects other regions.,"A deadly virus from Africa, known as Ebola, suddenly appears in the suburbs of Washington D.C. This virus is known to kill 90% of its victims, which results in the notification of the biohazard SWAT team. Known to deteriorate the entire human body starting from the inside, Richard Preston amazingly describes the unbearable situations which some characters must encounter, and of course make it one of their lasts days on earth. This deadly virus will take the life out of any living organism and spread through many regions and will also infect and kill those it comes in contact with."
2,"An interesting true story, horribly written.","I love a good contagion story, and I had high hopes for this one as it is a true story. However, the book is so badly written it constantly took me out of the moment to marvel at the awkward construction. I have rarely become so aware of an author's style that it irritates me to no end.It reads like a fifth-grader's book report. Some of the more egregious examples have been quoted in other reviews so I won't bother reposting them."
4,This chilling story of the ebola virus arouses emotions that,Even Robin Cook MD couldn't have written a better description of the deafly Ebola virus. The book satiates the needs of even the most chilling reader.
5,this was an entertaining,it was entertaining and gave me a lot of knowledge I never new about viruses.
4,Shocking true story,"After I had read this book for only 20 min. I was already hooked. This book is shocking and very informative. I never knew how potent and lethal the filovirae are. It gave me a terrifying glimpse into the world of 'hot' viruses like ebola and marburg. Anyone who is interested in epidemilogy, virology, or forensic pathology, this is a must read!"
4,"Good, but got a little old and redundant","Well I read the first part of this book really fast, I couldn't put it down, but by the middle of the book I felt like the author was repeating everything over and over again. He was also going into such lengthy details about the environment, which I found stale and boring. I would skip and few pages then read on.. So I wouldn't really recommend this book, I was hoping for so much more.."
5,"Gripping, Frightful Non-Fiction","This is a gripping story about the spread of emerging deadly viruses - specifically Ebola. Now we can add to our worries thoughts of deadly Ebola viruses hopping the globe via jet travel. Author Robert Preston keeps readers glued to these pages with his description of Ebola outbreaks in Africa. Victims arrived at hospitals vomiting blood, then convulsing, losing consciousness, and in most cases soon expiring - though about 20 percent recovered fully. We see how one strain of Ebola ended up in Virginia (USA) via jet travel, where it was discovered and quarantined. Perhaps nervous readers should remember that HIV/AIDS has to this date been more destructive, as was influenza to Native populations in the Caribbean region shortly after Columbus arrived.This book is readable, gripping, and sensational; it leaves many readers wanting more complex scientific information about viruses. A compelling read, but hardly for the squeamish."
5,Riveting!,"I read this book when it was first published and just finished a re-read. I was as fascinated this time as when I first read it in 1989. The author writes in such a way that the average reader can understand the biology of Ebola. It is completely mesmerizing. He is very detailed about the emergence of this deadly virus and how it is spread and by what mode. If you like Robin Cook and Michael Palmer, you will love this, all the more because it is totally true!"
5,Steven King was right: it just keeps getting more frightening.,"The worst part is that it's all true.I was in Washington when it happened and reading ""The Hot Zone"" and re-reading it as I have has never failed to induce nightmares, as only someone who has been in a ""Level 2"" containment area for real as I have can be frightened.I'd say more, but it would be silly. Just read it."
3,A terrifying scenario,"The Hot Zone was a gripping read for the most part, describing in frightening detail the devasting effects of Ebola and the filoviruses on human victims. I found the early case studies in Africa especially interesting, along with the forensic detection efforts to pinpoint the source of the infection. The story of the Reston outbreak was far less satisfying, bogged down with too many points of view and too much personal detail about the players involved."
2,Interesting but non-attention getting,"I was required to read this book in my Sophmore Biology class. At the beginning of the book I found it very interesting and desciptive. It kept me wondering what was next but as the book went on the antisipation seemed to stop. The last hundred pages or so were just full of facts. Once I set the book down I felt it more and more difficult to it pick back up as the book went on. In conclusion, if you are looking to do research on filoviruses such as Ebola or Marburg this book is full of information and it could be very helpful."
2,I Liked It Til the End,"I'm not going to give anything away, but I really enjoyed this book - was on the edge of my seat. And then reached the ending and threw it across the room. What a waste of time. I'm going to look into some other Richard Preston books because as much as I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, I obviously enjoyed his writing style. Just this story didn't have an ending."
1,Interesting topic...horribly written,"R. Preston addresses the reader as if they are in grade school! Countless times in the book he overstates the obvious. ...The workers wore level 4 biohazard orange suits, they were called orange suits because they were orange...Gee thanks so much for that insight, I was confused about that. On countless other occasions he insults the reader with similar drivel! The topic was more sucinctly covered and therefore more interesting, in the Readers Digest summary. Do us a favor Mr. Preston, use your computer for games, surfing or counting your money but please do not use it for writing novels."
2,The Hot Zone,"The Hot Zone by Richard Preston is a good book for educational purposes, but definitely not for entertainment or fun. I learned more than I ever wanted to know about the Ebola viruses. But I was bored, disgusted, scared and annoyed.It was really descriptive and gory. The way that the book described the way somebody died of the Ebola virus scared me to death!!!It also got really interesting and easy to follow until the end of the first chapter. Then I was so bored that I couldn't even follow the book. I couldn't concentrate.I ended up reading part of the book, then starting totally over a few times. I would read for a while then realize that I had been so distracted that I had no idea what I had just read.The book would build up a lot of suspense then nothing would happen.Once I read the book all the way through I realized that I had actually learned a lot, but I wouldn't chose to read it again."
3,It just seemed stupid.,"True: the topic addressed is frightening, interesting, and well worth reading about. But after struggling through this book, I find myself wondering if the point was to enlighten readers or to blast them with gory sensationalism. Every other teenager at my school seemed to have read it and all of them told me so, giggling, ""Oooh, blood, I loved it."" To me, the in-your-face gory accounts seemed like such an obvious gimmick. I guess part of what bugs me about this book is that the author has a great style. He could make it with one of those thrillers that get made into zillion dollar movies. But why would you want to read about a subject like AIDS in a thriller format? Oh, well. I guess this book was fated to be written eventually, though; I'm sure that if Richard Preston hadn't written it, then someone else would have gotten around to it"
5,This one frightening book...because it's true.,"This book is truly one of the most frightening things I have ever read, from taking the reader from an outbreaks of the Ebola Virus in Zaire and the Sudan, to the outbreak in Reston, Virginia it grabs the reader and doesn't let go. Be forewarned this book is not for the faint of heart, due to it's very graphic explanations. Mr. Preston reasearched his subject very carefully, and the book does read like a novel, but do not let that fool you this story is unbelievebly real and extremely terrifying, since no one in the medical community knows how to stop this virus"
3,Okay,"I have to read this book for my 10th grade Honors English class, but I do not recommend this book for that age group. Why? It uses a lot of profanity and words that 15 year olds ought not to be reading. It is a very graphic book and detailed, but I think parts of it are kind of disgusting."
5,I could not put this book down,I could not put this book down. I read it in two days. All this happened not far from where I lived back at that time.Worth getting!
4,Interesting book,"The book setting begins in Kenya around the 1980. A lethal virus is starting to emerge and begin in a remote town in Kenya and travel all the way up to the United State reaching Washington D.C. This is a non-fiction reading in which the main idea is the fast spreading of viruses and how they act.This is a very impactant book because is a true story and show us that, may be a virus, a lethal virus just behind in our backyard and that we are not safe from them. I would recommend it to every kind of person, adults and children so they can know and understand that viruses are a serious thingIn my opinion, this is a very good book in which it tells the truth of nature and how we are vulnerable to it. The author of this book had done a good research of how lethal viruses are, and showed that even great nation like the united state is not safe from these viruses."
4,The Hot Zone,"As an assignment, I was asked to read this book. To coincide with the studies of Africa we are currently involved in, my teacher had informed us that we were to purchase this book, and begin to read it. Although I was a bit reluctant, I began, and let me tell you it was quite the book! The details portrayed by Richard Preston give a great insight into the world of viruses, particularly the Ebola virus. The book itself could be considered a thriller and maybe even a horror story. Not due to fictional characters who frighten the reader, but an actual hot, amplifying, Level 4 virus that causes those who contract it to bleed out from any holes in their body and 9 out of 10 times, death. If you are interested in a real non-fiction horror story, with scientific references, then I would definitely recommend this book. Even if you are not one who enjoys science-like books, this book grabs you and will not let you go! Don't pass this book up!"
1,What would you expect from a reporter?,"Nothing like a sensationalistic, glorified, half-truth... Although an interesting fiction tale, this book comes nothing close to the actual events that transpired in Reston, VA. You want a real virus book? Keep looking, this one isn't worth it."
2,Queestionable - Needs fact checking,"I overlooked the obvious error in his creatively defining ""first space"" and ""second space"", then ran smack into the equally creative geographical relocation of Reston, VA.The author (or editor if there was one) needs to do some basic fact checking. It is difficult to take what is supposed to be a factual non-fiction book seriously when obvious, easily verified ""facts"" are in error. It casts serious doubts on the factuality of the remainder of the story."
1,Hot disinformation...,"One start , for some very acurate dramatic and terrorific facts about the Ebola, but very weak regarding origin of the virus, very unconvincing about possible ""theories"". sound more like that old music of desinformation, he almost blame another monkey for the Ebola like they did before with HIV.."
4,"Really, Really, Good...","overall, this book is pretty good. I highly recommend reading it while i won't promise that you'll love it. Very informative, yet gross. My personnal opinnion is that it is the best book i have ever read. i gave it an 8 because i know not all people will love it. BUT IT IS A MUST READ!!"
5,"Very good, scary and exciting. I could not put it down.","I really liked this book. It was scary, exciting and, of course, realistic. The begginning kindof put you thinking that it wasnt going to be very good. I mean the first scentence was: ""Charles Monet was a loner."" But it got a whole lot better after that. The scariest parts were the parts when he was describing the different stages of the viral infection and the end of the 'hosts' life, by crashing and bleeding out. I started to read thiss book just because I had to, and I was ready for it to reek of bad writing and taste, but I really like it."
5,It was awesome!!!!!!,It was just awesome! I had to read this book for english and I thought when I first got it that it was just another dull book that we had to read. But then I started to read it and I thought that it was really cool! Richard Preston is an excelent writer.
5,It was amazing because it is a true story.,I loved the book. It was horrifying but I still loved it. The events occured about fifteen minutes from where I live so it made it even more real for me. My mother didn't want me to read it at first but I convinced her to let me. I'm glad that I did and I reccomend it to all my friends.
3,Worth Reading,"I would have to call this book ""pretty good."" It's pretty fast reading and maintained my interest, for the most part. (But if I recall, the end portion contains a fair amount of filler). Covers a subject I never read about--deadly disease. The ebola virus. Its origins in Africa. The horror of it due to the extreme suffering it causes its vicitms before it kills them. The potential for it (or something else like it) to become a plague. How scientists handled it and prevented an epidemic. Culturally interesting because half of the story is set in Africa, and is very descriptive. Non-fiction that reads somewhat like a novel."
2,Curiously overrated,"I was so disappointed in this book. Several industry reviewers ranked this in their top 5 books of all time, so naturally I thought it was a must read. Yet, I thought the book was extremely boring, and could have been condensed into about one-third of its size by eliminating all the surplus and uninteresting details he included. I contrast this effort with On The Beach, which is also often listed by these same industry reviewers in the top 5 scariest books, and which really does deliver. This book would have been much better as a semi-fictionalized effort than as a total non-fiction piece."
4,The Hot Zone,"First I had to read a non-fiction book for my english class. I had not yet gotten one and I needed to read one in a week. My dad recommended to me this book. I went out and got it. I could not put it down. A grusome story about the different strains of filio viruses and what the effects they have on human beings. This book scared me, to think that somthing as terrible and species-threatening as Ebola could infiltrate the US, is mind-blowing. I would recommend this book to anybody."
4,Excellent,"I loved this book. I hope to be a doctor at some point in my future, and work in the field with viruses and such. This book, and The Cobra Event (also by Preston) give a gripping fictional edge to reality that you hardly know is there. I recommend it for anyone who likes a good thrill!"
2,wrong edition,this book came to me with the correct words and the correct book it was just a different edition than i thought i was ordering and the page numbers were different from everyone else in my class so reviewing the book by looking up quotes was a pain and i did not appreciate it
4,Good book,Book is well written - was shipped fast. Got several copies to use with my class at school.
3,Chilling story not well told,"Richard Preston has a terrifying story to tell, but his pedestrian, sometimes awkward, writing makes it difficult to read. Thanks to his choppy sentences and frequent digressions into irrelevant or repetitious detail, I found it hard to stay interested -- even though the story happened ten miles from where I live."
4,review,"The hot zone was very interesting, in terms of viruses and how they try to treat them. The hot zone was the place where the viruses were kept for intent to find out how they work and what they look like on certain species. The book was unbelievably exciting. The surgins were always indangered with coming in contact with the Ebola virus. I would really recommend this book for all age groups, high school and up. The book will keep you excited and will also knowledge you with the Ebola virus and how they work with this virus."
5,Can't Put it Down Book,"My daughter had to read this for her AP Biology class so I read it too. The title originally caught my attention since it was a school assignment. This book on the Ebola virus and reads like a highly suspenseful detective story. The story hits home since we have a level four medical research facility in San Antonio. It really is one of those books you can't put down. So if you have a lot of time to kill, this book would help pass the time quickly."
5,The book was extremly interesting but scary as hell!,Ths book is a detailed desrciption of the ebola virus and the several examples of experiences surounding it. It opened my eyes to a world i hadn't known exsisted and now i can't wait to find out more about! A great book for anyone interesting in science fiction.
3,Fascinating subject. Poor writing.,"Ebola and other currently emerging diseases are frightening and fascinating, and so the story of this novel is important. However, the writing style unfortunately presents the medical research of ebola outbreaks like a poorly written dime store horror novel. Preston makes bizarre metaphores for the ebola virus and its host with every imaginable food item from mashed potatoes to jelly donuts. Too much time is spent on character set-up in between actual events - and he makes real people sound like lifeless figments of his imagination. Still, the events are fascinating and his early analysis of the disease is accurate. If you're looking for a decent horror story, this is probably as good as any. If you're looking for science - look hard - it's there, but you have to swallow Preston's sensationalist writing style to get to it."
5,"EXCELLENT! And more frigteningly, a true story!","One thing that the summary, and even the following reviews failed to mention, is that this book is completely, and totally based on documented fact. How do I know this? I'm in the United States Army, and when I went through my 91T AIT, one of the persons involved in this (SSG Kurtis Klages) was an instructor of mine, as well as having met many of the other people involved. This happened, people! Nothing stated in the book is false as far as I could find, and believe me, I did my homework. Heck, the thing's about my job!There are viruses out there that could easily take out 90% of the world's population within 6 months. Comforting thought, huh? But that's why we're here, and we do what we do. To make sure it doesn't happen!Read the book!"
4,Awesome!,I loved this book as a kid and could never remember the name. I'm glad I found it again. I think the descriptive headstones were my favorite part.
4,Amended review,"Although there are pages missing(first time I have had a problem) I love the book. I can use it for most of the projects. I would order from them again, but request they go through the book page number by number before shipping. Any book by this author is great regardless of missing things, especially the older ones. I am not too familiar with the rating system, and should not have given such a low rating."
5,Wonderful book!,"I bought this boook, read through it, & went & bought 5 more for presents. It's a perfect gift. I found the text to really reflect the real meaning of Christmas, & the ""wishes"" in it were exactly what I'd wish for everyone on my Christmas list. I might even give 2 to each person, with the instructions to pass the second one on. This book should be sweeping our country this Christmas."
4,Great for when your away from the family,I got the beamer for christmas because I knew that I would be away from my family for the holidays. I set up the one at home before I left and On Christmas morning I made the call home and even though we were 900 miles apart we hot to open our gifts together.The only draw back was that BOTH of the remote control batteries were deadso we couldn't use all the features.The beamer is a excellent item to have for familys that are spread out over the country and can't get to see each other as much as they would like. (IE) grandparents
1,Short Changed!!,Waited 8 days to get the package which is way too long for Amazon's reputation. Package did not include pulley as pictured so now I have to buy one for $30 at my local car parts store. Thanks a lot!Update: The belt was the wrong size too...geewizI think 1 star is way too gracious....I give you one BLACK HOLE (a collapsed star).
4,Great cd,I loved the music and felt really relaxed afterwards...I was such in a trance I didn't even realize an hour had gone by and the cd was over! I agree with another reviewer that she talked less...or had other songs without talking.
4,Decent enough,"We use these for sporting events, best thing about them is the small size...I get thru security without them even seeingthem they are so small, not that they are contraband, but the small footprint makes things very easy.I've used the belt loop a few times and it works pretty well and is secure. Basic design.Not as powerful as I would like, but when you consider the price point it's a good deal.I would buy one again."
4,very good!!!,"I read all the reviews and I took a chance and order it, they are very light which I truly love, good for birdwatching and close views. Takes a while to get focus, but once we learn how to do it, no problem. It was a good buy."
5,Pentax 62211 UCF-X II 8x25,"I sought a binocular to suit a purpose of travel, ease of carriage, and above all a quality product.I feel that I got all of these attributes in the Pentax 8 x 25."
1,Extremely poor quality,"Out of the box, the parallax of the left and right views was off by 12"" over a thirty foot distance. That means the images are so shifted in the viewing plane that the binoculars are completely unusable. I would have thought that a brand such as Pentax would have manufacturing and quality assurance practices in place that would have prevented this from ever leaving the warehouse.Disappointing? Without a doubt. Would I buy a Pentax product again? Not likely. In Pentax's rush to increase profit by pushing defective products into the marketplace, I have lost faith in Pentax as a customer-focused, quality driven organization. And if you tracking Net Promoter Score, Pentax: No, I will not recommend this to a friend or colleague."
3,"funny, different just like before, but now what?","I always liked Demetri Martin; I thought he's funny, different, and smart. Watching this show though didn't add much. Yes, I laughed the first 10 min, he was as funny as always, but then it was the point of ""now what?""The Jokes became predictable, and his sketches weren't as smart as before.I hope he still has more to give and this is only a temporary pause."
2,One Trick Pony,"A let down, a disappointment, a failure.If you've had a taste of Demetri's work on the Daily Show and want more, then you'll probably enjoy this, though not as much as you might expect. Demetri's Trendspotting on the Daily Show hinted at absurdist comedic genius. His 'These are Jokes' CD went a ways to confiming this view for me - but this DVD is a regression. The principle downfall is that so many of the jokes are repeated from the CD. The repetition suggests either a shallow talent or a cynical attempt to leach more $$$ from unwary admirers (it worked!).The extras are weak and the show is remarkably short and stuffed with filler - strange animated ruminations on mythical mythical creatures.Buy 'These are Jokes' instead, its a superior, less contrived offering that covers more material for less $$$."
2,Disappointed!,"I own Demetri Martin's CD and thought that this special would be just as good. I don't think it was even close. Even though some of the jokes are the same, they weren't delivered in a way that I thought was amusing. Many jokes weren't funny, at least this time around. I think this special was definitely geared toward a more college crowd. I believe Demetri Martin can be funnier than this!"
5,Extremely Funny,I love this stand up comedian. His humor is not always straight forward and sometimes you have to think about it. He is extremely talented and I love his charts.
5,Hysterical!,"Demetri Martin is an extremely funny young comic who doesn't need the rants, raves, and fast-paced nonsense that other comics use in their acts. Demetri creates big laughs from a look or short quip. His comedy enlists the audience member to think, not just react to some wild provocation. He fills the niche of subtle humor not tapped enough in this fast=paced world. He is fantastic."
3,Intriguing,"Martin is something different for those who like off-beat standup comedy. Don't expect a lot of belly laughs, but instead a more subdued, goofy comedy that appeals to quirky and intelligent types. The artwork sketches, done by Martin himself, are the strongest elements.If you like guys like Jim Carrey, Martin Lawrence or Carlos Mencia...forget this and look for something else. You won't ""get"" it."
3,If You're REALLY A Hard Core Fan,"Commander Cody and his Lost Planet Airmen have for years had the title of ""Best Deviant Cowboy Rock Band"" all to themselves, and this CD is no exception. Unlike most of their CDs,just about every song on this one was original and, to the best of my knowledge, not available on any other CD. ""Sink The Constitution""and ""Joint Chiefs of Staff"" are well thought-out parodies with biting commentary - and are also funny as hell.BUT . . . Just about every second track on this album is a ""comedy"" routine. I found absolutely nothing funny in these and were a waste of space which detracted from an overall tight album - the kind that fans have come to expect from the boys over the years.If you just have to have everything ever released by CC & LPA, then go for it - there is a lot to recommend this, but not enough to overcome the [bad] tracks covering half the album."
1,misleading,I was disappointed in the small dinosaur I received. For amount of money I spent it should have been a larger figure. The shipping cost more the the dinosaur!
3,It's not worth the price,"It's a nice teakettle, beautiful design but after a few weeks it started cracking. It should have better quality coming from KitchenAid."
5,Great kettle,I've been using this kettle for a week now & really like it. My husband can almost hear the whistle; unlike others I have bought & thrown out after he has burned them up! Wasn't sure about the lever to open the spout but it works great. Would purchase again.
2,OMG beware.,First time I used it the rubber part of the whistle just melted! The insulating rubber on the handle does not protect your hand from the heat at all. The handle is way too hot. I can't believe they let this out of the design room. Took it back immediately.
4,KitchenAide Kettle,"We like the new KitchenAide kettle immensely. It's very attractive; in fact it has a permanent home out in the open atop our stove. The implement has a nice balance which makes it easy to pour boiling water. The only drawback, and it's a minor point, is that the handle is a bit warm to the touch when the kettle is hot."
3,nice looking on stove/ bad design!,Kettle handle gets very hot (does not fold down)rubber on whistle lever melted first time in useI had high hopes for this kettle because it looks nice.
1,RUST ON THE BOTTOM,"I THOUGHT THIS TEA KETTLE WAS QUALITY,UNFORTUNATELY AFTER 6 WEEKS OF USE TO MY HORROR I DISCOVERED THE BOTTOM ON THE INSIDE WAS DOTTED WITH RUST,I AM NOT SURE HOW LONG I HAVE BEEN BOILING WATER WITH THE RUSTY BOTTOM BUT IT MADE ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE JUST THINKING ABOUT IT. I STOPPED USING IT AND WILL TRY TO RETURN IT"
4,its a kettle,This is a very good tea kettle...hardly ever burns water. :) I like it and it looks cool in my kitchen.
2,Would not buy this one again,"ok, it does boil water, but when pouring the water splashes out all over if the pot is almost empty or almost full. The lid can not be opened if the spout top is in the up position and if you like to cheat and fill from the spout vs. removing the top, it will not work on this kettle. I might expect these items from a $15 kettle, but not from one this price."
2,"Bizzare, inefficient design","It boils water - that's about the only thing it does right 100%. Otherwise, the design is puzzling at best: grip handle is not completely encased in plastic and gets hot through the metal part - be mindful else you'd burn yourself. The little lid pops out with vengeance, too tight and requires too much force to open. The spout mechanism can mandate the use of both hands at times, because it's clumsy and inefficient. The trigger should have been built within the grip and actuated like a gun trigger, with one hand. Lastly, the grip handle cannot be folded to the side, like a proper kettle's handle should - perhaps to prevent injuries, however, it could have been designed with a built-in indexing spring so the folding action requires some force, rather than be absent completely. A simple design akin to Copco Zingo's, if properly implemented with stronger materials and better craftsmanship, would blow this kettle right out of the water. Look around for better deals."
3,"Decent pot, but...","I got the porcelain-on-steel teapot and only used it on medium heat. Within a couple of days, the porcelain began chipping off the bottom and a small spot on one of the sides. Not such a bad teapot per se, but that was a little disappointing.The whistle isn't as loud as I would like, either, but I can still hear it fairly well."
2,think twice...,"You will have better luck learning about chokes/strangles if you buy a basic Judo or Jujitsu book. This is one of those books that seems to have been thrown together, without thinking about how to exactly explain what is trying to be said. This book has those small black and white photos, with one sentence about what is being shown. This book is not for people who have some practical experience with chokes. It is defiantly not for those who are novice and expect to learn a ""Supreme Empty-Hand Self-Defense System""."
2,what he said..,"I could just as well copy the review blow, because it's exactly like I myself feel about it...here goes:""You will have better luck learning about chokes/strangles if you buy a basic Judo or Jujitsu book. This is one of those books that seems to have been thrown together, without thinking about how to exactly explain what is trying to be said. This book has those small black and white photos, with one sentence about what is being shown. This book is not for people who have some practical experience with chokes. It is defiantly not for those who are novice and expect to learn a ""Supreme Empty-Hand Self-Defense System"". (end Qoute..)"
2,Veterans Need Not Apply,"I bought this book to further my personal study of chokes and strangulation. While it was a good book, it was not what I expected. I was expecting more practical applications and techniques. It seemed to me that Kelljchian focused only on the types of chokes used in GoJu Karate, logically because that is the style he mastered. I was looking for a more advanced/comprehensive view of chokes and varied applications of techniques that I could incorporate into my training. I believe that my training in various martial arts as well as my expectations played a part in my disappointment with the book. Don't get me wrong, the book will remain in my martial arts library but this book was geared towards people with no knowledge of the art of strangulation. People looking for more advanced techniques will have to go elsewhere."
3,Got what i paid for,This item is good gift choice. But there is no discount at Amazon. I could have bought it for the same price at Calvin kliene store in the outlet mall. I would suggest to check out the product at the local mall before buying at Amazon.
4,seems to do the job,"we were worried that this might not be the correct filter, as the size and shape are a bit different than the DCF-10 that came with our vacuum. but it does indeed fit, and so far is filtering just fine."
3,"Misadvertised - This is not ""genuine"" Eureka part","This is misadvertised as ""Genuine."" This is NOT a Genuine Filter.It is an aftermarket replacement filter.Does it fit? yes.Does it function as well? It seems to pick up some dirt and dust, but don't have actual numbers to compare a genuine and a replacement filter. The verdict is still out on its performance.The seller needs to change the title of the product (isnt it illegal to misadvertise).The package is in a plastic bag (not a Eureka plastic box), indicating that I don't know the quality of where or how it was manufactured. The seller should at least put it in a plastic or carboard box. The filters were smushed into my small condominium mail box.i will try and use these but next time, I will avoid going to this seller and just buy at a store. ""genuine"" my @zz!"
1,Never Rec'ed,Never rec'ed the items. I have canceled the order and I will never order anything again from you folks. I have E-mialed twice about not rec'ing my order with no response from no one.
1,DO NOT BUY HERE!!!!!!!!,"I ordered my product on 8/12. It is now 9/12 and still no product!!!! Also, contacted seller and no response. BAD SELLER! AMAZON should consider booting them due to pure neglect. Not only of me, but of other sellers also. Now we know why the price was so good. RUN AWAY! I will be filing a claim with Amazon today in hopes that I will get my money back. I would put ZERO stars if it would let me!"
4,Eureka DCF-14 Filter,"Filter was hard to fit into vacuum model I have ( probably older model) , but with little bit of work it fits and works, OK."
4,Its a filter - better than trhe 10,There is a difference between the 10 and 14 - its worth the extra cost.
3,Not a factory part,"I ordered a factory filter but that's not what we ended up with. The fit was ok. It took a bit of work to get the filter to fit and the top of the canister to seat correctly since it was for a few different models. Next time I'll go to the store, spend a few more dollars, get it off the shelf and ensure it will be for the product we own. The product was shipped not from Amazon, drop shipped from a different vender."
4,The right filter!,"If I got this as a gift, I would be upset, but since I bought it and needed it I am very pleased! Thank you Amazon!"
5,"what i needed, quickly","The product was delivered within 2 days and it was exactly what I ordered, for 1/3rd the price of Bed Bath and Beyond"
4,Just what I wanted,The whole process was very simple. I rec'd it in a timely fashion and the product is very good.
5,Better performance,"Fresh smelling, better working vaccum with addition of this filter. Cheaper than at a store too."
5,A clear gem.,"It was love at first sight. I was in a used book store and glanced into a forgotten corner, then our eyes met and my heart soared. "" I'm a lazy man "", I said to myself, "" I seek enlightenment "". We've been friends ever since. This little book is very powerful and sincere. So much reverence is attached to so many books, so unwisely, therefore the only danger with this book is to set it up too high, and thus seperate it from ourselves. Some may not like the acid references, but they also work well as metaphor. It is a gem you will want to share with everyone. A fine guide for anyone concerned with being."
1,What a Disappointment!,"I bought this book precisely because of the five-star reviewsand the glowing customer comments. Maybe my profound disappointment in the book has to do with the high expectations I had. But even without high expectations, I do not think I would appreciate this book. I found the ideas to be nothing new and found the writing rather insipid. The lack of inspirational ideas and the dearth of memorable passages were made even worse by the author's veiled recommendations of drug use as a potential road to enlightenment. This book should have remained on a drug-soaked San Francisco 1970's street corner. It has no place in my spiritual library."
1,Silent Movie?,"I purchased this DVD to share with my students during Women's History Month. The only description available was ""Biography depicting Betsy Ross and her life."" It did not indicate that it is a silent movie. The captioning was even too large to be seen fully on the television screen. Since I had to open the DVD and view it to determine that it was not appropriate for my students I am unable to return it for a full refund."
4,Big surprise!,"This was a really great book with a totally cool plot, cool Characters (Karen, Jerry, etc.), and a very unpredictable ending. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of five is because the villain is a person I really liked!! I kind of pouted at the end, but I was really impressed with the story as a whole. This book gets 2 thumbs up from me!!"
4,it was good,I thought that it was quite good. I think that if you added a character that was made to sound a bit more of a villen then you might get a better responce!!!
2,I think it stunk.,"I thought that it sucked. I mean come on, R.L. you can do much better. I knew who the killer was right when I knew who all of the characters were and who got killed. You can do much better."
3,okay book,"I thought the book was ok but R.L. Stine could have done a much better job like, added a little more scary incidents and I thought the ending was very stupid. Karen at the end didn't have much things that would kill her. She was in the ocean arm hurting and uses the snorkel to get back. Anyone could have done that. They should have explained how Renee got killed did Jerry talk to her? Also the story didn't sound like a mystery or a horror. In the story it never mentioned how the black spray paint can got into Ann-Marie's chest drawer in the first place. R.L. Stine could have done a MUCH BETTER JOB!!!!!!!!"
2,Stick to Celtic Work RJ,"Alright book. There are better books on Qaballah out there. I was quite suprised to see this author undertake this book, and disappointed. It seems these days that no one is content to develop a purely celtic magical tradition. Are the european peoples ashamed of their rich spiritual past and potential ? Come on people, there is so much to be discovered out there from our own genetic history without having to goto the middle east, Amer-Indians, Asia, the west Indies or Africa. People should be able to get what they want out of the tradtions they have a birth right to, leaving other peoples birthright traditions for them."
3,"Watch out, it's an enclousure","Watch out, it's an enclousure. I did't read carefully and i bought it thinking it was a camera."
5,Great story for boys!!!,"The book is almost 100 years old - however the story is quite contemporary - it involves boys & Boy Scouts! Some of the language is dated, but it expands the vocabulary which is always a plus.Wish the Boy Scouts of America would republish this author."
1,GARBAGE and CHEAP,This video phone is the biggest garbage in the world. I bought one it is a waste of money. Video quality is horrible and cheap!! U will not be happy with this. I also have a motorola OJO video phone. That is much better than this. If your gonna get a video phone get the OJO. The price is higher but the video quality is superb!!
2,Not Good,"This Abbott and Costello was their worst.It was a BOMB.It was a love story with little comedy.Bud and Lou are not even main characters.The only funny parts are ""The mustard routine""but thats it.Do not waste your money."
2,this was terrible,"for a first film for abbott and costello,this was their worst.abbott and costello arent even the stars.and some routines were not funny.the only funny routines to me were the musterd routine and who,s on first,that was it. do not waist your money"
4,Abbott & Costello Debut,"This movie debuts one of the best comedy teams of all time. Although Abbott & Costello are not the stars of this film just about every scene they are in is hilarious. The rest of the film holds up on it's own too. The ""Who's On First"" routine is featured in this movie and also in ""Naughty Nineties""...For a movie debut Abbott & Costello are stellar. A must have for any Abbott & Costello fan and any old time comedy fan."
3,Abbott and Costello meet Universal Studios,"ONE NIGHT IN THE TROPICS is typical of many musicals of the late 1930's and early 40's: a glossy, fast paced film with a ridiculous storyline. Fortunately, this one benefits from a lovely Jerome Kern score, and from the film debut of Bud Abbott and Lou Costello. While Allan Jones, Bob Cummings and the rest of the cast struggle valiantly with the sometimes impossible demands of the script (at least Jones' singing is heard to good advantage), Bud and Lou are allowed to cut loose and get laughs with some of their tried and true routines. If nothing else, the film is valuable as a record of some traditional burlesque chestnuts: ""Payday,"" ""The Mustard Routine,"" ""Jonah and the Whale,"" and an abridgement of ""Who's On First"" are all here. Abbott and Costello's delivery make these old warhorses seem fresh and new, which saves the film. Surely a tribute to this team's talent."
2,Bad ear pads,The reason I bought these is that it fits OVER my large ears and is very comfortable. What I didn't know is that the ear pads wear out with limited use and they charge $15 each to replace them (plus shipping). That is highway robbery for such a replacement part. They shouldn't wear out so soon and should be about $5-6 for the pair to replace them. I'll not buy Sony again after talking to their customer service dept.
2,Too noisy,The sound and distance of reception were very good. The problem is I bought these because my boyfreind likes to watch TV in bed and I can't sleep with the noise. Well they are just as loud as the TV was when I'm 2 feet away from him.
2,Nice but too prone to interference,"Overall, these are very nice headphones. The sound quality is nice, the connector-less charging is nifty, and the fact that the power is switched on when you put them on is very convenient.However, I never really felt comfortable with them on, they always seemed a little too loose and there's no way to adjust the fit.The major reason I returned them was the static. I needed them to listen to music while working and while practicing my electric guitar. As I moved around, I was getting constant buzzing, static, and clicking noises depending on my position. I could turn my head or move a bit and it would go away, but it just wasn't workable to hold my head in one position to get good sound."
2,Disappointed,"When the headphones worked, they were wonderful. Problem was, they only worked for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. Something sure wasn't right when these were built."
2,Noisy: Read full review before getting wireless phones,These phones use FM 900MHz technology and they are the 3rd pair of this type that I've used (I've also used RCA and Sennheiser brand phones) and they all have noise problems: kind of a fuzzy hiss that increases as the music gets louder. I know it's not the input device because I can plug in a set of wired phones into the same device and it sounds fine. Turning up the output volume of the device it connects to does not help. Actually the RCA phones which were the cheapest also were the least noisy. The Sennheisers broke after less than a year (sound only came out of 1 earphone). Fortunately I returned the Sonys right away for a full refund and got the Amphony digital phones (the $99 dollar model) and the Amphonys work great with no noise. The only reason that I gave 2 stars and not 1 is that they have good range and the noise issue may be tolerable to some.
1,Noisy. Very noisy.,"They are s*** Buy if you like the experience of listening to a FM station from 500 miles away in a 40 year old Volvo (I'm sure some do). Hissing and crackling all the time, distorted high-pitch notes. Does not go away by finetuning, volume reduction, or any other way of going around poor design. You can't drown the background noise, it get's proportionally higher with the volume. This is not even Chinese quality, must be made on a ship. Even if you ignore the hissing, the quality of the sound is worse than earplug models. No depth, no bass, no nothing, excuse my inability to talk in hertz and stuff.BTW, let me smack Panasonic too. These wireless Sony headphones were supposed to replace some wired Panasonic ones I've had a while. Boy were those s****y too. If I can't find quality in Sony and Panasonic, is the world coming to an end? Luckily, with this kind of engineering I rest assured the Japanese are not going to try reconquering the world over again any time soon."
3,"When they worked, they were fabulous","I bought the Sony headphones in 2007. It is Dec. 2012, and they are toast. The sound quality, the comfort of the fit (I have a small head and my husband's is much larger) -- well, I really loved the headphones. Should I be happy that I had 5 yrs. of listening pleasure? The motherboard on my Sony Vaio Laptop only lasted 2 yrs. So I am questioning Sony quality and thinking that I may change brands."
5,Great Value,"Any adult who has kids or a wife sleeping but wants to watch a movie or a good surroundsond TV show should love this product. Heard about this from John Hein on Geek Time, so I thought they might be spendy, but they seemed very reasonable to me."
5,Good product,"This product preforms as advertised. It charges effortlessly, hooks up easily to our HDTV and is an excellent choice for my needs. I'm 66 and have difficulty picking up dialogue when I watch movies. With the headphones, I can adjust my volume to suit my needs while my family sets the TV volume however they want it. It's also great for solo watching with other people in the room- the TV sound can be muted while I hear everything perfectly. I can even walk into the kitchen or bathroom without interrupting the sound. My only complaint is that the sound knob on the headphones is a little difficult to turn, but it works fine. I would not recommend the phones for audiophiles as the bass is not full. That actually helps with voice recognition."
1,sony headset-wireless,"the sony head set was very disapointing, had a lot of static and would not stay on longer than a minute was very nerve wracking. sent it back.and probably will not get another one."
2,Don't like it,"I don't like it because it starts to adjust the frequency channel automatically, by itself. You here many ""clicks"" in head phones. The manual tuning is much more better and convenient. Don't buy them."
3,POWER SOURCE DID NOT WORK,Sony MDR-RF970RK Wireless Stereo HeadphoneTHE RECHARGEABLE ASPECT WOULD NOT WORK (I DID A FULL CHARGE AND HEADPHONES WOULD NOT WORK). HAD TO PUT IN MY OWN REGULAR BATTERIES AND IT WORKED FINE. I BELIEVE CHAREABLE SHOULD BE PART OF THE PACKAGE PURCHASED.
1,Only worked for 6 months...not happy.,"This headphone product only worked for 6 months. First, one side went out - at about 5 months. After that neither side works, just static with a faint sound in the background. Maybe the battery needs to be replaced? The battery is $18+."
1,Extremely poor product offering from Sony.,"Stay away from these headphones, they stink. I have many Sony products, 2 Televisions, Blue Ray, 2 Cameras, Video camera, and this product does not stack up at all. I could not get the rechargable batteries to take a charge and had to use AAA batteries instead. Extremely poor sound quality, with background white noise and extreme feedback as I moved about."
3,HEADPHONES - short life,"I bought these headphones about 1.5 yrs ago and thought the sound quality was good. They're now dying on me - much crackling going in the phones, which I cannot understand. The Sony quality is not what it used to be."
2,Mixed emotions with Sony Wireless Headphones,"I replaced my MDR-RF970R with the RF970RK because the ""R"" headphones were worthless. The ""RK"" headphones are somewhat better but even changing the location of base, there is still considerable interference occurring more often than acceptable. The sound quality, though, certainly excellent particularly for a unit in the $75 - $100 price range."
4,great sound quality,"These headphones have made my husband very happy!. They have long range, ( he walks outside)) and excellent clear sound. He tried 3 other models before these from department stores. Likes these the best."
1,Horrible,"Before I ordered this product I read all the reviews (mostly bad some good) and decided that i would try it, BIG mistake. This is like all the reviews said, the charging doesn't work and every time you move it creaks and groans. The sound quality WAS good but just not worth it with all the negatives. Also, the headphones are huge, they are 1/4 the size of a Imac's screen.Very bulky and cheap looking. I wouldn't recommend these to ANYBODY. Also your mp3 player or media player always has to be hooked up to the base which is very bad for travel or if you have a ipod."
1,Not a good experience,"Reception was poor with consistent static, popping, and a tinny, squealing noise. And this was from about 10 feet away. On top of that, the headphones didn't charge properly. Although the arrows were lined up, the only way to make the headset charge was to lift the top of the headset slightly and hold it in place.This thing was a piece of garbage, basically. Very disappointing."
4,Sony headphones,"The headphones work really well. I find myself wearing them more often, as I can do other tasks and still catch most news programs. My wife likes them for her favorite programs, also. They do have an anoying pop in them at times. Not sure why or what causes it, but overall, good item for price."
1,"Poor quality - Sound ""cuts out"" randomly","The MDRRF970RK is impossible to use for listening to TV programs because the sound ""cuts out"" for 1-2 seconds at random intervals. At first I thought it was due to the battery not being fully charged but that turned out to be wrong. I ended up waiting over 30 days of testing and SONY would not take them back (policy is 30 days for returns) and I didn't want to get a ""new"" set since they would just repeat the same performance. I'm going to throw them away! DO NOT BUY!"
4,Best Wireless Headphone from Sony.,Best Wireless Headphone from Sony. I can enjoy watching TV late night or even watching movies on my laptop. It's great product from Sony and worth buying it.
2,it hissed and popped.,"The headsets never worked well at my computer, it hissed and popped. I waited a full day to let it charge, it died in the first few minutes. I may try another one; this may just be a fluke."
1,Believe what you read,I really rely on Amazon reviews before I buy a product but in this case I gave Sony the benefit of the doubt. If you like listening through one ear these headphones are for you; but for those of you who expect a product to work out of the box I suggest you buy from another company.
1,Review for Sony MDR-RF970RK,"First of all, this is not something you can carry around.I bought this becasue I wanted to enjoy music without headphone wirelss bugging me all the time.The head phone rest should be plugged at all time for this headphone to work.Also, sound quality is terrible. White noise is almost equally loud as the music I am listenting to, it is impossible to enjoy your music with this headphone.I didn't expect great quality in the first place but this is really bad. I don't usually write bad review for something I buy unless it is really bad.Don't waste money on this product, save money and buy something that in the range of 200~300.If you think that is too expensive, stick to regular (with wire) headphone. I think this wireless technology for headphone is still not at the point where it has good quality at affordable price."
2,They are wireless. That's about it.,"I've never written a review before, but I am compelled to say that these things are very disappointing. Once you get settled, you can avoid static, but the quality reminds me of watching a VHS movie on a TV with one speaker. Voice quality is lousy. Base only makes the rest of the sound distorted. So very disappointing. I expected better from Sony."
1,Piece of Crap,"I figured if I payed up for a 'Sony' I'd get a quality product.I have had nothing but problems with these. There is a lot of static unless you orient your head just right. I usually don't return items unless they just don't work, so I decided to just live with these.Now they don't even work (bought on Feb. 29th). I can get them to work for a short while by cycling the power (PITA). I went to return them today and found out that I've missed Amazon's return window.So I guess that's $62 down the drain."
5,Sony Wireless Headphones,"I've seen a lot of bad reviews on these about the static and the distance. I don't get that, why would you want to stray so far away from your CD player or computer or even your Ipod when you need to change songs. It took me 2 minutes to figure it out, I had them on the charging base right away. After I seen the green to go I slipped them on and switched on my receiver. I was hoping for static to see if the earlier comments before were true, I heard nothing. I had Linkin Parks What I've Done going which is a pretty bass hitting song when it gets to the guitars. I heard no static cause people seem to think you have to turn your volume all the way up on the receiver or cd player. You only have to crank it maybe %15 then use the volume control on the headphones. They work great for my room, I can lay down and not have to deal with the cord or yank my gear down when I go to grab for something forgetting about the no slack. 5 stars for these, great for the price and quality."
3,Adequate stereo headphones,"I used this model for several years and was pleased with the performance. When it stopped working, I ordered the same model as a replacement. I installed it the same way as the previous one. However, I am not getting adequate volume with the replacement. May be it's just that my hearing has gotten worse."
2,Sound keeps cutting out,Sound keeps cutting out. I have bought this same product at Best Buy 2 times and no problem Thinkl it might be the battery that cuts out
3,Good Buy,"I did a bit of a research and after all the reviews I read, was a bit apprehensive about this product but then didn't come across any other product with similar feature for the price this was listed (in the websites I trust enough to buy from). There's almost been a 50-50 split between people who seem to like this vs the ones that cannot stand it. I have been using this for a few months now on almost a daily basis and I'm okay with the product (tho I miss a mute button the most, Sony - anyone listening?!).This works pretty well usually but has its moments where it doesn't seem to get any signal at a specific position within 10 feet of the base! Overall this is a okay buy and works well even if the base is in a different room. I have not come across much of disturbance or garbled voice on a consistent basis, but there have been times for short periods when it wouldn't just catch a signal."
4,Work good but heavy,"I finally had to buy the updated version of these headphones after owning them for a few years; I got tired of getting a headache after wearing them for over an hour, and if you want to rest your head against the sofa they turn off because the on/off feature is built in to the strap that goes over your head. Battery life is ok, we have had them in use for marathon tv watching over several hours; only static is after a few hours of use or when the microwave is in use. Overall I was pleased with the purchase, but am looking forward to the upgraded version that are supposed to be lighter and has an on/off switch."
3,Almost pretty good,I needed wireless headphones so that I could watch TV without disturbing others. These had good consumer report ratings - and were reduced in price. They work perfectly and are not affected by all the surrounding electronic stuff near them. The directions say to be careful about that - and I was. I was disapointed when I could only hear in one ear - not stereo - rechecked the packing information - and it seemed like maybe it wasn't REALLY stereo - so I didn't send them back - then - every so often - I would turn my head a certain way and stereo would pop in and then out. I haven't figured out to keep them on stereo - but then I fall asleep anyway.
1,$89-down the toilet! Shame on Sony!,"The headphones always had pretty bad static, no matter what channel I changed them to. I should have gone with my instincts & returned these right away after we received them. My husband purchased these for me..seemed to think that 2:1 5 star:1 star reviews was a good ratio! >< I would have read these reviews & steered clear! If the static wasn't enough, the base stopped charging continuously after a very short time. If I unplug it & plug it back in, it will start charging again, but then will stop again before the next day. The last time I tried to use the headphones, they had no charge & they haven't been left off the base or been used more than 2-3 times..ever! This is my 1st 1 star review, so understand that I regret [his] purchase with every fiber of my being..lol ;;>> ! I no longer have faith in Sony. :("
1,No power lots of noise,"Very dissatisfied. I bought these so my wife wouldn't be disturbed by the TV when she wasn't watching. They are noisy, even with the volume on the headphones at a low level and the TV at a high level. That made me dissatisfied. Then after light use the power on the base became unstable and would shut off after about ten to twenty minutes, plug and unplug and a good for another ten to twenty. That moved me to be very dissatisfied. I've never commented on a product before, that is how dissatisfied I am."
3,Don't use near a wireless router,"My dad gave me a pair of these as a gift last Christmas (2011). They've gotten a lot of use, mostly with music and video games on my computer while other people are sleeping, watching a movie or football game on the projector, etc. They are quite comfortable, have good sound quality, and we have never had problems with battery life. But we usually have to unplug/replug the power cord to the base unit before using the headset or we get nothing out of them. Further, we hear almost constant static and ticking noises in them. I have a wireless router which sits on the desk below my monitor. When we turn this off, the static and ticking vanish. I agree with other reviewers that these headphones appear to be analog. I'm going to try moving them downstairs away from the router once I get a new TV down there this week, and will try buying a new explicitly *digital* headset here next to the router."
4,Experience,"I like the Sony MDR-RF970RK Wireless Sterio Headphones but they appear to have a flaw in them. My brother purchased a set two years ago and when I saw and tried his, I purchased a set and was going to buy another for my wife. After several weeks I noted that the sound would click on and off occasionally. I called my brother and he said that his did that also but the benefits exceeded the irritation. The annoying sound interruption could be a bad connection or a power problem. I tried putting a filler in the head band to move it up but it did not help. I was going to return them but my time had exceeded the Amazon 30 day limit. Dad"
4,Great quality for great price,"We bought these to use on the elliptical machine while watching tv in our house. We actually bought two and can use them both on both tv's because each transmitter has 3 channels so you can be watching a show in one room and walk to the next and change the channel and listen to that show as well.The sound quality is very good, better than expected for a $70 set of headphones (compared to $300 for the Sennheiser ones). I rate these as 4 out of 5 just because they aren't Bose quality sound. However, that's not what I bought them for. The extra workout time each week now instead of sitting on the couch to watch our favorite shows or sporting events has really paid off.Definitely worth every penny if you are looking for good quality at a reasonable price."
3,Happy with headphones ... but with one minor technical glitch!,"I bought these headphone because I have trouble hearing all the dialogue in the TV shows I watch. I found myself needing to turn up the TV so loud that it interferred with my husband watching TV in the other room. These headphones serve their purpose, but the wireless connection cuts out periodically where I need to turn up the volume on the TV in order to get the headphone to make the connection again, then I can turn down the volume on the TV.Maybe I'm doing something wrong, but it does getting annoying.Still happy with them. It's just sooo nice to hear the TV without interferring with my husband's TV."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTING,"I purchased these headphones hoping to replace my 7 year old pair of Sharper Image headphones whose earpieces are starting to disintegrate. But these Sony MDRs turned out to be a bad substitute because they have such poor sound quality. Listening to the TV is a distracting, unpleasant experience because of the tinny sound of these headphones. You feel like you're listening to a pocket transistor radio from the 60's. They totally lack the warmth and depth of sound my Sharper Image pair offers. Needless to say, I have returned these for a refund. Now what's even more disappointing, Sharper Image has discontinued their original wireless set and only offers these Sony MDRs. Go figure???If anyone has a suggestion on an reasonably price pair of quality sounding wireless headphones, I'm all ears."
3,Squeaky wheel gets the grease? I think not.,The headphones squeak every time you move your head. They sound nice and work well. I would not buy this product again because of the squeak. Sony can do better than this.
1,RF970R (not 'K'),"The ear pads disintegrate, pealing, leaving little pieces of black vinyl on the hair, ears and pillow. The battery door can't be locked in place, it will open and fall. My last solution is Elmer glue it. Other than that, is very good."
3,Not happy with this unit.,Found the unit to be all there on arival. Instruction were printed to small to read and no help on the websits (ebay or Sony) for better instructions. The battery seems to not be charging as it should and I am still having a problem with hooking up the unit to my TV. I have a flat screen and single sound feed our plugs for RCA jacks. Would not recommend these unless you love trouble shooting everything to get them to work.
3,TV listening,"Sound quality was excellent and household noises did not interfere with TV listening. Helped me understand some words that I had been missing due to slight age related hearing loss while keeping the TV volume at a level comfortable for others. My 96 year old mother with a more severe hearing loss who can hear reasonably well on the telephone was still unable to hear all TV programs clearly, so individual results will vary. They are a little bulky to wear. Another ear muff style brand I had tried also amplified household noises which was very annoying so I view noise cancellation as important."
4,Wireless headset - Sony,Product performed as advertized.Good audio quality.Comfortable over the ear listening.Somewhat cumbersome nesting the headset into the cradleWould recommend buying.
1,DO NOT BUY THESE HEADPHONES,"i really wish i had listened to these much more in the early months of owning them so i could have possibly returned them but alas, im stuck buying another pair/trying to find a better pair because the background fuzzy noise is driving me crazy! there is a CONSTANT, no-matter-what-you-do fuzz in the background, im constantly changing the channels, etc but it never goes away - and I'm listening to these at my desk at work, with the docking station within arms reach so there so be minimal interference - anyway, just wanted to warn everyone to keep looking, these are not the perfect headphones, the background fuzz will drive you batty!"
3,Too bad; nice features - lame sound,"I like the ease of cradle recharging. They're very comfortable to wear. I didn't experience the noise that some folks reported except when I went downrange in other rooms. It's a real shame that Sony didn't do something about the real reason you buy any speakers, headphones or not. The sound is just incredibly flat and tinny. I returned this pair and bought a $50 rechargable unit from Radio Shack. The RS pair isn't perfect either but the sound is infinitely better than the Sony. These are not as comfortable as the Sony and there is no choice of 900mhz channel. However it hasn't yet had reception issue."
1,"I rarely write reviews unless I'm blown away, or dissapointed","I guess I got caught up in the great sound I have gotten from my other wireless headphones. I worked for Best Buy part time a couple years ago and I bought 3 sets of Rocketfish wireless headphones for family members. Everyone agreed they sounded great; no hissing or audio issues of any kind. So, I figured wireless headphone technology has come a long way and I should be more than pleased with Sony headphones. Dead wrong. The hissing is continuous and annoying, something I did not encounter with the Rocketfish brand. This will be the first time I've sent anything back to Amazon."
3,stereo headphones,"With mixed feelings concerning these headphones I will submit this review. First off I have this set for my home in NC, where they are excellent! So, I ordered again this set for my condo here in FL. While I can hear movies and tv programs well ( must tell you that my hearing has become less over the years when listening to movies )These allow me to understand the words spoken quite well. My only problem is that I get more static here than in my NC home. And, I can't walk out of the room without getting lots of static.I believe these are good headphones just not as effective for condos. Overall, I'm satisfied."
4,Sony MDR-RF970RK Wireless Stereo Headphones,"Work great. Replaced AR set that broke due to design flaw. I use these in workshop, they act partially to reduce the noise of power tools and let me listen to tv as I work. I may buy a second unit to use in the house."
4,My response 12,"I have a hearing impairment so I use this device everyday, but regrettably they are not usable with the newest flat screen television so I may be stuck with my television for ever"
1,Does NOT work with my TV,"This item was set up CORRECTLY,and it does NOT work with my TV. I will be returning this item ASAP."
4,Great sound,I works great as long as within the range - very clear with 20-30 feet. Very comfortablle and fit nicely around your head. The best feather is the sound will mute when remove from your head - save battery. I'm happy with this product.
2,RBC USA,I am looking for a replacement for the Sony MDR-RF970RK. I have tried many different volume settings and positions and can't get rid of the static. Static fads in and out. These headphones also drop out repeatedly. This is fixed by getting up and unplugging the power connector then plugging them back in.I bought them because of the Sony name but am not happy with them.
3,Worked well but gave me a headache,"I liked how well the sound came through with these headphones and that I could walk around the apartment without losing the connection. However, after wearing them for more than about twenty minutes I developed a headache. Also, it was annoying to have to switch the base plug in from our Roku box to our DVD whenever we changed the source."
5,Well Worth the Money,"I bought these headphones for the sole purpose of watching TV at night while my wife slept. I first saw them at a Sony outlet store in Canada priced at $100.00. I liked the idea but not the price so I decided to shop them on Amazon. Glad I did. I bought them here for around $60.00 plus Prime free shipping and it is a great purchase. I can find nothing wrong with them. For what I paid, I think the sound is very good. Also, the frequency can be changed with the push of a button so there is no issue with static or other noise. They charge on the base so no worrying abut replacing batteries---which I hate. They are comfortable and fit well. Overall, just a great item that serves the purpose I bought them for at a great price. Awesome."
3,Its not bad but its not great either...,I just got this today and they work fine. I do every once in a while hear the static sound but its not to often so i can deal with it...I just don;t like how there isn't an off button cause i walk around my house and sometime i just put it around my neck and it still on and waste battery...I mean it convenient to have it auto on and off when you put it on and take it off but there should still be a off button. But beside that i think this is a pretty decent headphone for a decent price. Now i gota look for one that i can actually bring outside and go to school with. lol
1,Creative Director,Not happy. Frequency was static no matter the situation I used. Not a good product. Would pay more for better.
2,"Excellent product, BUT -- effectively no warranty","As with many Sony products, it performed very well -- for 10 months.; I especially like the automatic switch in the headband that turns the 'phones on/off. However -- I am now shopping for a replacement -- probably Sennheiser.They worked perfectly for 10 months, then quit. They are now in Sony's ""black hole"" of warranty repairs. Shipped them back over 6 weeks ago -- they didn't know they had them for three weeks, after I supplied proof of delivery at least three times. Then they found them and now they are lost again. I attribute this to Sony not valuing customer service enough to devote the necessary resources.My next pair will be Sennheiser -- 2 year warranty & excellent reputation."
4,Good Stuff,"I have had these at my work for several months now (bought them because I hate background noise when I'm concentrating on a spreadsheet). They sound very good when they are set-up as the instructions suggest. They are big (like the ear protection the deck crew wear on an aircraft carrier), but they do deaden outside noise well. As to the crackling and popping noises they make when you move your head, it comes from the joints in the hard plastic and is quite noticeable at first, but decreases a lot as they get broken in (I don't even notice it any more). Not having to worry about wires any more is wonderful!Pros: Great sound, and outside noises are blocked. Automatic on/off switch. Convenient recharging - no battery changes. WIRELESS!!!Cons: Big. The heavy black plastic crackles at first.I would buy them again, and recommend them to friends."
2,Ear pad problems,"Love the cordless headphones. Been using them for 2 years now. They function as advertised. Only problem is with replacement ear cushions. I not upset that I have to replace them after 2 years of heavy use, I'm upset at the price of the replacements cost being 33.00 each. That's right, 33.00 for one (1) cushion. So, for a pair it's 66.00. I can buy a new Base and Head phone for 67.00. I've only found one source for them and that's Sony Parts. I've tried to get someone to verify the cost as I might believe that there might of been a problem with input of the price, but none is interested. I'm having a hard time of being a repeat Sony Customer after this expearience. If someone has found a better price on replacement cushions, I'd sure like to know."
1,Bad static,"So after being disappointed by a previous set of wireless headphones from another manufacturer, I decided to try these out. I was encouraged by the overall positive reviews. I brought these home, hooked them up, popped in a couple brand new AAA batteries, since I wanted to use them immediately and not wait 16 hours for them to charge, and nothing. No light on the base. I fiddled with the power cord and finally got a transmission. Every one of the channels was filled with static. Not just a faint background noise, but loud crackling over everything. I tried moving the base, moving the headphones, adjusting the cords. At one point I was holding the base right next to the headphones, and still got the bad static.Needless to say, these are going back immediately. Very disappointed."
3,Sony MDR RF970 RK,Feels cheap! The quality of the sound is regular and I will never buy it again!!!!!!!
3,Decent Sound but bulky.,The first thing that struck me was the size of these puppies. A bit overwhelming...they were comfortable and the sound decent. But i had to return them because of their bulkiness.
2,Sony MDR-RF970RK Wireless Headphones,"These headphones were really a disappointment. I had a set of Recoton wireless phones that I had purchased from Sharper Image about 15 years ago. The foam wore out so it was time for a replacement. The overall workmanship and quality of the Sony unit out of the box was noticeably ""cheap"" but what was even more disappointing was the poor sound quality - gutless sound with poor high and low end. The conduction charging is a nice feature, but doesn't make up for the poor audio. The 15 year old Recoton sounded head and shoulders better. I am returning these."
3,Typical Sony --- a so-so product,"When I bought this set at a BestBuy guy's suggestion, it had been a good 10 years since my previous Sony purchase. And this one didn't turn out to be a very good choice. I live in a single-family house, with neighbors all at least 80' away. So neighbors' interference shouldn't be a major issue. Still, about 40% of the time, the sound would turn a little coarse, like a man with a soar throat singing. All the channel selections, checking the batteries and their positions, etc. did nothing to help. The remaining 60% of the time, the sound quality is reasonably good, but not terrific.Don't trust the ""up to xxxx feet"" range Sony claims. Its actual range in my house is about 25' in my house (with 2 walls or 1 floor + 1 wall) before the sound turns funny.I'm looking for a new wireless headset now, but I'm done with Sony for good."
5,Works great for us,"Since these headphones work at 900mhz, I suspect that those having problems may be using them in proximity to old cordless phones that worked on the same frequesncy. We live in an apartment where I can detect 15-20 wireless networks, we have a microwave, and we use cell phones. My wife can even walk into another room without losing signal.We've had these for about 18 months and really like them. My wife is a little hard of hearing and a comfortable volume for her is not comfortable for the rest of us. I searched and read a lot of reviews before giving these a shot. Despite my wife's initial skepticism, she tells me how much she likes them. I do, too :)"
2,The hiss was just too much.,"I ignored reviews that said the headphones hissed. Some people said if you adjust the source volume vs the head phone volume you could get rid of it. But after having them for a week hooked up to my home stereo, I had to take them back because I couldn't get over the hiss.They have some nice features. The recharging cradle is nice. The fact the head phones turn off when you take them off is nice too. They are loud and pretty clear, if you can ignore the constant hiss."
2,Susceptible to Static,"I recently ordered these for wireless listening in the office. I wanted to love these, I really did, but there's simply too much radio interference in an office setting. There are only three channels to choose from, and sadly none seems to provide any respite from the almost constant static buzzing of radio noise in the background. I had hoped that having the transmitter nearby would drown out noise, but even at two feet away there's too much static to be able to listen to anything without going mad. These headphones may work fine in a home setting with less radio noise, but it's a gamble."
1,Extremely Disappointed,"After having used an older model of Sony's Wireless Headphones for several years and being very pleased with them, I decided to make an upgrade by purchasing a newer model. That was a mistake. First off, these headphones did not fit perfectly around the ears as the older model did, although I realize this could be due to the size and shape of my ears and not the headphones. But the bigger problem was the sound quality. While I experienced slightly (and I stress slightly) less background static, the audio quality was horrible. The audio was extremely distorted and did not sound at all like it should. In short, I would not recommend these to anyone looking for wireless headphones."
3,Sony MDR RF970Rk,"This product does what it advertises to do in delivering audio wirelessly. The only two issues that bugs me is the short battery charge life and the frequent static, even when fully charged. On a fully charged battery, I can go roughly 4-5 hours before needing to charge it again. As for he static issue, maybe if Sony had opted to use bluetooth tech instead of RF tech to delivery the audio wirelessly, this would have eliminated the static noises.Conclusion, this item is not worth it at full retail price of $99, but worth buying from amazon if you can get it at $69.99 like it did."
3,Home Use Only...,"They sound pretty good and were very easy to setup out of the box. I bought them to use at the office, however they have a very limited set of operating channels so I couldn't find one that was clean. They are pretty much useless if there are any other wireless devices present unless you enjoy a droning buzz in your music. I pretty much wasted my money on these since I cannot use them for what I wanted them for."
4,Overall pretty good,"I bought a pair of these when a site had a super discount sale on them so I wasn't expecting a whole lot out of them.First off they are nice and light unlike some other wireless headphones I've purchased. No fatigue after wearing them for hours on end.Sound quality is decent. I use them at work so I am never more than 15 feet from the base but i sometimes get some crackling in the headphones. Not a big deal. Haven't really tested the range on them yet.My only major complaint so far is as I move around with them on, I hear the plastic creaking/rubbing against itself which is very distracting."
5,Sony Wireless Headphones,"When I unpacked the headphones I thought they would be heavy and cumbersome. After the first movie I was hooked. They are lightweight and comfortable. Since I am very hard of hearing, they are a miracle! I can enjoy my TV again. Thank you Sony!"
2,Sony Wireless,"I have owned so many Sony headphones in the past, I thought they would be automatically great. Not so.I like my music with lots of top and solid bottom,and these don't do that. These headphones are for simple sounds,like talking in movies.Not to use for the fullness of music.The bass with distort right away. I'm sorry I bought these,but,I will keep them to hear tv programs.That's all they are good for.I really want to drop them in the garbage."
5,My Sony's rock,"These headphones are great, I simply followed the directions and plugged them in. I use them for everything from television to radio and even with my ipod. The sound quality is great and I am really impressed with the battery life so far. I think the initial charge makes all the difference. Great purchase I am super satisfied!"
3,MY EARS ARE KILLING ME,"I have no problem with the sound quality, the battery life or how far you can go and still get great sound!One problem is you cannot adjust them so they won't be so tight and the BIGGEST problem is that in less then an hour of wearing them they hurt my outer ears (cartiledge areas).So now I am trying to find a pair that won't hurt!"
2,Low quality sound,"Although the headphones do function, with fairly low interference in my location, the quality of sound is pretty horrible. I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile, but I think most smart phones produce better quality sound. That being said, they'll get the job done if you don't want to deal with cables, and have low expectations for sound quality. I've decided to find better quality headphones that are not wireless and just deal with it. They wind up being much cheaper too."
3,Too Bulky,"I bought these for my husband to use because he turns up the volumn on the TV too loudly. I should have thought about this, but he likes to lie on his side on the sofa to watch TV and these cannot be used effectively that way. Also they don't work if the TV is muted which I guess makes sense, but it would be nice to sit in the same room and read and not hear the TV while he's watching it. He said the sound quality is good though. Next time I will buy itty-bitty ones so he can lie comfortably while using them."
1,Broke the first day,"I returned this obviously, the sound wasn't nearly as good as the sennheiser low end model. But I needed something that would stay on mine or my mother's head. Tried these but wasn't willing to sppend money on something so flimsy with only a 90 day warranty."
4,Very good quality,I have been looking to get a second pair of cordless headphones after killing one of mine with a vaccuum. I keep looking at all other models but come to realize that this pair has always worked perfectly for me. Sure I would like better distance but when within the distance of ANY 900 mhz model this model gives you perfect performance. So i am ordering a 2nd pair for my main TV.
2,Lots of interference buzzing.,"Works ok, but cell phones and tablets across the room send random buzzing and line noise. Wife couldnt use them when her IPad was on the nightstand. shes picky about clean sound, and interference drives her nuts."
5,Sony headphones,The headphones arrived quickly and were packaged in the original box. Looked like a new product that had never been used. All of the parts were included. Thanks!
5,Great for this non-audiophile,"I haven't had these very long, so I can't comment on the battery life, but as it runs on rechargeable AAAs, I suppose I could replace them easily enough if I decide it needs doing.I'm not an audiophile, so take this salted appropriately. :)The sound quality is certainly good enough to hear what's going on in a program, and the sound exclusion is good enough to cover a noisy puppy who thinks I should be letting him chew on my hands rather than watching TV.Set up was no problem for me: hooked up audio and power wires, let it charge for a while, then put it on my head and pushed the ""Tune"" button and, bam, it worked. There is a bit of static, but it's so minor I haven't even tried another channel, the range is good enough I can walk around the house without missing a word.Now my pregnant wife can nap and I can watch TV without disturbing her. This goes down as a winner in my book."
2,loose fitting,"Headphones took FOREVER to charge ... decent sounds, but the fit is horrible. the ""self adjusting"" headband to keep it tight to your head ... forget about it ! Great if you stand or sit with your back straight, but if you bend slightly forward or back they start slipping and if you bend over to pick something up, you better have a free hand to also pick up the headphones ... cause they are coming off !"
4,I like the headphones,I do not find many of the annoyances written by other reviewers. I like the headphones. The only problem that I have is that the wire provided for connecting the headphones to the receiver is way too short. It requires the antennae/recharging station to be placed next to my stereo receiver. My stereo system is installed on shelves built into the wall. The headset mounted on the recharging station does not fit on my shelves. Fortunately I have a room behind the wall where other electronics are housed and where I was able to locate the antennae/charging station. Because the wire is so short I cannot conveniently locate the unit to use the recharging station; alkaline batteries must be used.
4,Sony Headphones,This is my second set. This is a good quality product for the money. Battery life is pretty good. I ordered a replacement battery for my original set but it would not charge. It could be the tramsmitter was going but I had the headphones for over 2 years. Only drawback is you sometimes get some interference when you move around but it goes away. Good product.
2,"Comfortable, but nosisy","I have been looking for a nice pair of wireless headphones for a while, these were ALMOST perfect. They were comfortable, and had decent sound quality. (there was a bit of static, but it was bearable) The one thing i couldn't stand was the sound of the actual headphones. They creaked, and squeaked every time i would move my head. It sounded like elves were hammering inside my ears. I had to return them."
2,The sound sucks. The battery is short lived,I can not use this item as much as I would like to since when I am wearing them I hear some interference which is really annoying. Another thing is it's short battery which reduces the time of the constant headset wearing even more
3,"Sony ""Noise Reduction"" Wireless Headphones","Disappointing sustainable range is not near as good as cheaper/older Radio Shack 3301197 wireless headphones on same 900 Mhz Fm carrier wave system; nowhere near 150 feet spec marketed (maybe try the Sennheiser RS120 advertising 328 feet range instead?).The inner-band on/off switch is poorly designed, and a decidedly unnecessary ""feature,"" as settling into a chair with the headphones resting on a headrest will turn the headphones off (head sinks while headphones do not, think about how annoying this is!). The ""noise reduction"" is entirely ineffectual.Perhaps by locating the transmitter base closer-to and higher-than predominant use, the system will be OK, but not worth 4-5 stars by any stretch.Note to other users: batteries will require numerous full-charge cycles to be brought up to charge-holding capability."
2,Not Happy - Not good quality / Bad value for money,I bought it couple of days and did not like it at first sight. I found it very Bulky!After setting up also my bad experience continued. Difficult to power it up as Power cable doesn't fit well. Lot of static at times.Wouldn't have bought it at store and thinking of whether I should go through the pain of returning or 'Grin and Bear it'
1,"Snap, Crackle, Pop Go These Headphones","First off, the charger didn't work, even after the suggested time for recharging the batteries. Did work with the AAA batteries.The sound quality - I'm not going to lie to you. It simply SUCKS. You're probably better off with a $10.00 set of kiddie headphones. The sound is tinny and crackly and lacking in decent bass. The result is that it sounds much more mono than it does stereo and no amount of tweaking from your stereo or computer system is going to make these things sound any better than they do. For a serious audiophile with a Bose system in the car, forget about it. Take my word for it, these headphones are an insult to your ears."
3,Lacking Hi-Fidelity,"I liked the features. They were OK on comfort, and I thought the reception was OK. But they were very lacking in Bass, and when I tried to boost it up using an equalizer, they couldn't handle the additional input. They would be Fine for someone that just used them for watching TV. But if your particular about how your music sounds, and want it to go loud and sound good, Forget it. I really wanted to like these headphones, but they were missing ""authority"" on the bass end of the spectrum, and there was nothing I could do to improve it."
4,Great product!,"Great product, my wife didn't like me watching tv at night, problem solved. Now she can sleep and I can watch my favorite shows while I rest in my bed. This device has very cool audio clarity however it occasionally stumbles upon some static which can be annoying, otherwise I am very happy with this product. I def. recommend it."
1,sony cordless headphones 970,"Help! My sony cordless headphones sound great but the transmitter shuts off often. Is it a battery or transmitter or electrical problem? I need cordless headphones for my computer to allow me to walk around my house while listening to stuff off my computer. I'm willing to replace Sony with a better brand, if there's such a thing. Any suggestions?"
3,not dependable,"I find that the audio doesn't always work as expected. Sometimes the sound only comes thru one side. There is almost always a buzzing sound in the background, but I can ignore it once the program is on. The volume is not always consistent either. This seems to be a common problem area with these type of devices, tho, so I wouldn't be quick to hold it against this brand."
4,wireless is great,"Nice headphones. Sound is great. About 50 feet range inside my house, less than advertised, but enough.My only complaint is that the headphones make annoying squeaking sounds unless I hold perfectly still."
4,Private Listening,Ease of setup and excellent reception. Headphones fit well and I like the feature of the headphones being activated automatically when you put them on and shutting off when you remove them.
4,Nice Headphones!!,"I got this headphones recently and I have to say they are a great buy for the money, they really sound great and even though they look really huge they are not really heavy so you can wear them comfortably and that was a big plus in my opinion and also the fact that I can move freely while using them is awesome."
5,Great for Gramma,"Bought these headphones at the request of my 94 year old mother-in-law, who discovered them at a neighbors. She absolutely loves them and is able to watch TV without her hearing aids in. The box looks like it had been opened, and had slight, unmentioned damage on the outside, as if a price tag had been torn off, but still worked well as a birthday gift!. Other than that all the pieces parts were there and worked well after charging. In fact there was an extra battery included, so that bonus overrode any concerns. They looked like a nice product to me and were exactly like her neighbors (...and we couldn't find them in stores...), so were pleased to find them online - and Gramma loves 'em!!!"
1,Not worth your time or money,"I have been on a mission for a few weeks trying to find a quality wireless headset. I almost purchased this same headset at BestBuy for $120 dollars, so when I saw them on Amazon for half I jumped. I wished I hadn't!!!! They are total junk. I have a lot of experience installing and setting up home theatre systems as well as car audio systems so I know a good deal more than the typical customer. I say that only to get the point across that I did in fact set these headphones up properly and adjusted volumes levels appropriately. The cold hard truth is this: these headphones have absolutely terrible sound quality. I can listen to AM radio stations in my car and get less static. Very poppy, with come and go sound. I tried multiple channels and relocating the base station to absolutely no avail. Bottom line: STAY AWAY FROM THIS SONY PRODUCT!!!!"
2,Not for Movies and Music,"Pros:-Easy To Setup- Easy to Connect and Tune- ComfortableCons:- Major draw back is, it has no Bass. Cant watch Movies or listen to Music- Lot of noise from head band (makes weird noise all the time)If you want to watch news and watch programs on you cable this is a good bet, but if you want to watch Movies and Music..... I say no to this product."
1,Sony wireless earphones,"The earphones are not the best thing I ever bought they started out promising enough but the second time I used them, they started cutting out, making them virtually unusable. I went to the Sony web site and that wasn't especially helpful, they covered everything they thought i needed to know but nothing I needed to know."
1,Disappointing,"Thought with the Sony name and the hype, these would be a good option. I am returning them! They are bulky and uncomfortable to wear. And too many times the channel would change abruptly and spew very loud sounds nearly taking out my eardrums. And then start tuning to different stations. Now, this might be user error, but without a Phd in noise canceling headphones, and the troubleshooting guide a simpleton like me can interpret, I don't care."
1,These headphones often stop working,"Often the Sony MDR-RF970 headphones don't automatically turn on as they are supposed to. At random times when they are on they turn themselves off. I highly recommend finding a different model of wireless headphone. The only positive thing about these headphones is that they are fairly comfortable, but the hassle of poor performance makes them not worth the money."
1,SONY put its name on any junk these days..,"very poor sound quality, no bass at all... a lot of interference 10 feet away... i returned this headphone.. it seems like SONY puts its name on any junk these days"
1,"At this point, I expected as much from Sony","They look cool but I needed more than that in my wireless headphones. If anyone thinks these will sound like wired over the ear Sony headphones, they are kidding themselves.Other 1 star reviews nailed it, with static and horrible bass my biggest issue. I had no problem with the battery.This is yet another disappointing product from Sony that I returned. These should be bluetooth, how hard would that have been? My Motorola Q9m and S9 headset sound superior to these at 15 feet, but alas I wanted something simple for the home.I took these back, got a Jabra A120s stereo bluetooth transmitter and $75 in change, it is still charging now but I'll see how that goes."
2,Not great quality,"The headphones are nice and comfortable, but they really lack in sound. There is pretty much no bass and they sound pretty flat. Even with the headphone's volume control very low, there is still noticeable static in the background. They are also not very noise isolating. I would not buy again."
4,Pleased with the purchase,"Works well right out of the box, easy to set up, charging time normal, range good , easy fit in the charging cradle. Easy adjustable to head, control buttons a bit small and takes some getting used to."
3,"Sound Quality OK, but minor interference that can distract you","These were on the cheaper side than other wireless headsets, which seems to explain the sound quality. I use them to watch movies and am less than 15 feet away from the reciever. I experience the interference when moving around a little bit as well as the position of my arms/hands. I also get interference sometimes when grabbing the TV remote."
2,Not worth the money,It will shut off while you have it on. Works well when it works but you never know when it will stop. The volume control but fell into the headphone almost immediately. Expensive price with poor quality.
3,Just try to find a replacement battery.,"I've enjoyed these for at least a year or more and think the sound quality is pretty good, but when the rechargeable battery (BP-HP550-11) would no longer keep a charge for long, I had a TIME finding a new one. No search of the Sony site could find it. And I can't find it on Amazon either. Yet the manual insists that it must use this battery that's not commercially available for the charging/transitter to charge them. Using substitute manual-suggested commercially available dry AAA batteries will not allow you to re-charge using the supplied charger/transmitter and they certainly won't last as long as their hard-to-find battery. With all the rechargeable batteries out there, why Sony couldn't design a product that would make use of them is beyond me. If it's a built in way to force you to replace the whole thing just for lack of a battery, it's backfired with me. ""Built-in obsolescence"" is a vile way to treat a customer."
1,OW!!!! These are static-y and cut out with a loud high sound. NO RANGE,I got these just to wear while in my room at night so i wouldn't wake others who are sleeping. My room is not too large... but no matter where I sit in my room I hear static That cuts in and out. Also occasionally they make a VERY LOUD sound then cut out completely and I have to turn base unit off then on. I WISH I would have listened to negative reviews instead of wasting my time with these terrible headphones. I had expected Sony to have a way better quality item than this!!!! These are going straight back to Amazon. By the way the range on these things is ridiculously small....if I walk more than 10 feet away from the base unit they cut out non-stop. BAD BAD BAD wish I could give it negative stars....I can't really speak for the battery life as I have only used these today and won't use them again.
5,Sony wireless headphones,"I've had these phones for about three months and they work great. I have them connected to the output of my SonyLED TV, and they sound very clear. The volume control dial is a little hard to find when you are wearing them, as it doesn't stick out very far. I also took a white marker and made a dot on the cradle and a dot on the headset to easily line them up for charging. It is easy to get them backwards. I would have thought Sony would have thought of that. I hope they continue to work as well as they do now."
5,Sony MDR-RF970RK Wireless Headphones,"Don't know how I've lived without these. Used to have a wired set. You can actually walk around the house, I've even worn them outside, probably 100ft from transmitter. They are comfortable, fit great. I'm hard of hearing so the wife doesn't have to constantly turn down the volumne on the TV's. I watch a lot of news programs and have found you don't need to sit in front of the TV to get the news. Can actually get work done in the garage. Like I said I don't know how I got along without these."
2,range could be better,The range is quite short but it comes with a nice charger. The controls are not very ergonomic because are hard to access.
3,Mediocre wireless headphones,"For the price I got this set, its probably worth it. I got'em for $30. The charging tech is amazing and quite convenient. The headset itself is quite comfy and only after a very long use you start to feel the discomfort. Battery life is okay. I have used it continuously for 3-4 hrs and it still had some juice left. Sound quality is quite mediocre. Consider it as any $5 standard stereo headphones. Whats really annoying is the constant hissing sound in the background that just won't go away. Also every now and then you'll get this crackling sound which gets quite displeasing at times and you'll have to take the headphone off. The multi-channel (3 channels) feature is nice but I didn't see any sound improvement no matter which channel I chose. So if you are someone who really wants to enjoy the sound then this definitely not for you.If you are considering buying this set, it better be under $30."
3,Sony headphones,"son prácticos se encienden automáticamente al usarlos, no tienen mucho bajo solo el preciso en general hasta ahora me han resuelto bien."
4,headset,"this headset is very good and easy to use. You can walk all over the house and still hear the TV. I love this as I am hard of hearing and the TV can be set at a very low volumn, but I can still hear very loudly and clearly. Great product!"
3,"Okay, and just that","they are very big and bulky, great for high pitches and mid tones, but terrible for low sounds or bass, i make music so they are terrible for producing anything with a low bass line or heavy kick, but the good thing about them is you can leave your room walk around and still hear perfectlyif you want them for making or listening to music, bad choice, but just as a pair of headfones for anything else, recommended"
3,"Works ok, squeaks and groans","Works ok, but when you move your head, plastic parts rub against each other and it squeaks and groans. Don't move your head!"
1,noisy!!!!!,"constant noise... how in the hell sony let this product out of their QA?really.....really .... badi bought this item hoping to get a sony quality, what i got was something that you might pay $5 for in your local thrift store. Npt something that worth paying 85 dollars for..."
2,Too Much Background Noise,"I have a home recording studio and was looking for a quality pair of headphones for use in playback of my recordings. I went to Best Buy and sampled around 10 different models. These Sony's stood out as good sounding and around the price I wanted to pay. I wanted to stay away from the $300 headphones as I didn't think that was neccessary for my application. When I received them in the mail I was disappointed in the background noise. If I am recording a track, I want to hear the true representation, not background hiss. I played with the 3 different zones as recommended in the instructions to eliminate the hiss, but had no success. The background white noise was the deal breaker for me. I sent them back."
4,Very Nice!,These headphones work great!!! Good sound. Easy recharging. Very convenient on and off. The only drawback is they pick up some moderate interference occasionally. I haven't been able to figure out what it is from yet. Moving my head seems to mitigate it most of the time. It may be because I have the transmitter crammed between my stereo equipment and the TV. I still recommend them.
4,Helpful for exercise,"I bought this product so my wife and I could workout while watching TV or listening to music. Occassionally I get a little static but I'm not sure where it comes from and it's not often enough to be bothersome. Sometimes it's there, other times the reception is crystal clear. We have a Wii game system and when wearing these headphones you hear things that you don't hear through the TV speakers (the players footsteps, audience talking, more discreet sounds of the racket hitting the ball, etc). Hearing those extra sounds are necessarily important but I'm mentioning them to say the headphones are very good. They work just fine and buying them online (Amazon) I saved about #25 over stores in town."
1,"really noisy, bad sound quality.","it work just fine for few seconds then the noise starts, no clear sound even if i'm seating within two feet of the transmitter . I read many of the reviews and i tried everything to make them work probable but they didn't. don'e waste your money. just buy a regular headphones the wireless ones are useless if you like loud music or if you care about sound quality."
4,Review,Work well in my college dorm. Helps keep out the noise when trying to study. Good value for the price.
2,Unpredictable,"Sometimes, the headphones have trouble turning on. Sometimes they make a zapping noise and turn off without warning. They work well when they stay on, but you never know how long they will work before they turn themselves off."
4,Sony Wireless Headphones,"I am generally very pleased with this product. It functions as advertised. The only issue I have is with the bulkiness of the headphones. Even so, they are relatively comfortable."

3,wow christmas,"I received the Wow Christmas CD and was disappointed quickly. TheCD case was cracked and taped over and my immediate response was to send it back. However, considering the lack of time I decided to keep it. I played it without any problem. But the initial disappointment in the packaging makes me wonder if I will purchase from Amazon again. This was my first time buying from Amazon. First impressions really do make a difference!"
2,somewhat disappointed,"I bought this CD last week and listened to it and I was very disapponited. Even though I know of the Christain proformers on this CD. I was expecting the Christmas music to be sung in it's traditional way. But instead it was sung in a form of jazz and some rap and what got me the most is some of the Christmas music sung on this CD was not the Christmas music I have been growing up on. The words were the same, but the meledy was different and that ruined it for me. It made me put it up for the rest of the season. I will probably trade this in for another Christmas CD."
3,SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING,"While many of the songs on this CD were wonderful, my friend and I were both disappointed that some of the beautiful traditional songs were revised so much; perhaps they are more appealing to the younger crowd, but it saddens us that tradition is being lost. Kathy Mattea and Amy Grant were my favorite artists on this CD!"
2,WOW Christmas,"I am very disappointed in my purchase of this CD. I wish I would have read the other reviews on Amazon before purchasing. Why can't the popular Christian singers just sing the songs as they are instead of messing them all up with their own ""creativity""! I actually bought 2 copies of the CD, one for me and one for my sister in law as a Christmas gift. I will be returning the one I haven't opened yet, for my sister-in-law, and get a different CD for her. I wish I could return mine as well! A waste of $20, which is what I paid at Best Buy."
1,Previous reviews,I was in the process of purchasing this cd but changed my mind based on the reviews of others. I looked over the title tracks again and realized that most of them were based on Christ. I will make a more precise review once I have purchased it and listened to the tracks myself as I too intend on celebrating the birth of Christ during this holiday season.
4,Popular Music Feel,"The CD collection is definately not something I was expecting to hear when I first put the CD into the player. But as I started listening to the tracks repeatedly, I found that the songs grew on me, even if the styles aren't what I would expect from these Christian artists.Most of the songs have either more of a Popular/Top 40 or Rhythm and Blues feel to them, mixed with the traditional lyrics and tunes that most people are familiar with. And while not every song is devoted to Christ - and some do have that ""snowy-stay-cozy-near-the-fire"" feeling to them - most songs in the compilation are more suited to Christ's birth than other popular collections that are released this time of year.If you're after something that's reflecting Prayer/Praise music or traditional hymns found in a church setting, this CD may not be for you. But if you're after a combination of time-honored Christmas songs mixed with contemporary styles, then the CD is quite a pleasant surprise."
4,Loved it,i enjoyed singing songs i knew and new ones i am learning..helps me focus on God and all Jesus did for us all!
5,Another winner!!,WOW is right. Out of a lot of Christmas cd's this is well listened to! This cd and it's brothers (WOW Christmas green and WOW Christmas 2011)are really great!
2,Disappointing,"I love Christian music and I love Christmas music, so I thought this album would be the perfect combination for the holiday season and I couldn't wait to pop it in and usher in the yule tide. I was sorely disappointed. I can appreciate the effort to update traditional music and put a fresh spin on classics, but most of these songs were nearly unrecognizable and that's not what I want in my Christmas music. I want to spend the season listening to beloved favorites and sing my heart out to them for the month or so that we have together...Not scratching my head and trying to figure out the music. I was also surprised by the R&B flavor to a lot of the songs. Again, nothing wrong with that genre of music, just not what I expect and find comforting in my Christmas music."
5,Brutal Heavy Heavy Death Metal!!!,This is one hell of a death metal band!!! Heavy heavy bone crushing death metal!!! I like all of the songs on this album so I can't pick just one song to talk about! This also is my favorite album out of Cianide's other great musical offerings. This is what I think anyway. Cheack this album out and Cianide's other great bone crushing releases also! You can't go wrong with this group trust me! STAY BRUTAL!!!
3,Not really a guide book!,"Despite the title, this is not really a guide to Pokemon characters. My son is five and loves Pokemon cartoons (is it OK to call them cartoons?). He does not have any Pokemon video games. This book provides some details on 60 characters. Details include height and weight, power, and little known fact. There is a two page layout with the names of all 380 Pokemon characters with no additional information. So, if you want info. on all Pokemon characters this is not the book. The remainder of the book includes mazes and other games. Paper is of fairly cheap quality; cover is more durable. I am sure my son will love this book since it is about Pokemon and has some games. He is five years old. I would not buy this book for someone more than seven years old. Apparently, you need a more expensive book to have better information on all the Pokemon characters."
4,Good overview with pictures,A good book for children just starting on Pokemon. My daughter loves it.
5,My 6-year-old loves it!,I was impressed by how well my 6-year-old was able to draw using this book as a guide.
4,More Lomax Italia,"Very interesting five part vocal groups . . from falsetto to basso . . .ever so vaguely reminiscent of doo-wop street type harmonies. It's nothing like I've heard from Italy, but that's what Alan Lomax did, document the most remote, grass-roots corners of the earth. It's the sort of thing to collect if you like eclectic world-music type stuff, not necessarily for someone looking for familiar Italian melodies delivered in a more rootsy style."
2,Doesn't work for Minkota Riptide 45 pound,"Whenever the trolling motor prop gets into weeds, the circuit breaker pops and I'm without power for a while until it resets. Looks like I need to go for a 60 Amp or larger to prevent this problem."
4,product,recieved in a timely fashion- well packaged- hard to rate electrical item until I use it will reupdate review when I do -but it is as advertised-seems like it will do the job--
4,Riding down the road,"Mr. Johnstone's first installment of the ""Rig Warrior"" does not disapoint. It has been awhile since all of these book have been available and my husband and I are glad they are once again. This story revovles around Barry ""Dog"" Rivers and his unquinchable desire to see the unjustices in the country turned to positives. Mr. Johnstone's way of writing a story pulls you in and gets your mind moving to the possibility that maybe there are things going on out there that we don't know about (its only a thought). Read this book and enjoy a complex weaving of a tale that will leave you wanting books 2 and 3."
3,A slight decline for these guys.,"Each album by these guys gets a little worse. While still good, their sound doesn't change at all from disc to disc, and it gets a little old. I would recommend you listen to the samples before buying."
5,Grand Fun!!!,"I loved the Grand Series, so it was with some sadness that I viewed series 2. There is something about knowing that a series is about to end that prevents you from enjoying it completely. This is how I felt about the second season.I felt the characters were all well represented, the issues facing each character real and poignant. At times, I couldn't tear my eyes away! In particular, I enjoyed the episodes with Miss Harkness (the ex-Madame), returning to her old business, and the episode with the maids going on the beach 'outing' was fun. I did get bored with the 'baby-buying episodes.' Surely in postwar England, there would be plenty of orphanages and places for women to buy children legitimately without resorting to such melodrama! I also felt sorry for Marcus' wife. Years of abuse at the hands of her grandmother and then Marcus had produced its tole on her. Somehow, I wish she could be redeemed.Overall, an excellent series. A must for fans fo Upstairs Downstairs and similar dramas."
5,The Grand was great!,I looked forward to watching each episode. Each turn of event made you wonder what was really going to happen to the hotel.
4,Grand,Enjoyed the period set for this story. Also how the story's through the characters lives which Kelleys one interest through the series.
3,The Grand TV movie,"I really like period movies or TV, that is why I wanted to see this TV movie. It was a little slow and you didn't get attached to the people in the movie. I did look at a few of the season's and when I found that I was not really getting much from seeing them I stopped. I would not buy this TV move and way glad I could pay just to see it a few times. I think a movie has to have people you can relate to or want to see more of what they are going to do in the movie. This one fell short"
2,Mercenary - you're killing me,"It's not good. I LOVE the good doctor, but he must have been hurting bad when he recorded this weak album. It's hard to listen to - uninspired arrangements and incredibly redundant phrasing. Boring is the mood, and Johnny Mercer is not a boring composer. As a truly dedicated patient, this album concerns me. Jeepers Creepers, Mac! Take a break, get ""That old Black Magic"" back, and return to funky groove where you reign supreme."
3,Must Read,"Although I was familiar with a lot of the stories, there were some that were enlightning and a must read for our young african american student athletes."
5,Tired of Racist People Like Laurie Kunkel,"I feel that Laurie Kunkel's review should be removed because it is very obvious in her remarks that she is a racist and hasn't read the book. EVERYONE has problems or has felt mistreated or disregarded in some way, therefore, reading the book would require an open mind versus someone assuming that this is just another black person complaining."
5,Provocative!!,"Mr. Rhoden I applaud you for this book. It is really on time and long overdue. Some of what you have written in this book concerning the BlackAthlete I have been saying for years but no one wanted to hear it. All Blacks not just athletes, should read this book. Thank you again for calling it like it is."
