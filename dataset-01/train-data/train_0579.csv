1,BORING,"I expected a lot from this CD, but it was a let down. I agree with the review that said that the packaging was great but the contents of the CD didnt measure up. The sound quality of the CD is awful, I was constantly having to change the volume control of my stereo. The singer is nothing exciting...she does a decent job but nothing that would set her apart from a million others. I didnt care for most of the songs, although I Get Along Without You Very Well and Baltimore Oriole are definitely the best - vocal and production wise."
1,Nothing special/Dont waste your money,"This CD was reccommended by a friend, so my expectations were rather high. What a disappointment. Miss Jamison is so typical of today's crop of singers - they try to sell on their looks.It's not that she is awful...but she is nothing special or posseses no distinctive vocal quality or style that would set her apart from other singers. The reviewer that called this a masterpiece must be a friend. This is nothing near a masterpiece...want to hear a masterpiece go buy a CD by Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Sarah Vaughn or Carmen McCrae. Those are great singers that have great arrangements to back them up. This CD doesn't come anywhere close except as an amatuer high school production. It's a wannabe but it can't."
2,It's the same as a cheap furnace filter.,"I was disappointed to pay so much for a cheap furnace filter. The real filter that goes into this model is a HEPA filter and I didn't realize this one would be so basic. I'm really looking for a high quality filter, not sure this one will do much to really filter dust and allergens from the air."
4,It's A Filter,"It's a filter, and it fits. Nothing fancy, but it's much cleaner than the old one. Pretty fair price too."
5,good price on quality filter,"This is only available in a few locations locally, much more convenient to purchase here, the price is competitive even when including shipping."
1,Hunter filter,"I paid $24.50 for this filter when I pay less than $4 for my furnace filter which is the same kind, only bigger! I also bought the black filter which came as a sheet that I have to size and cut. If I had known this ahead of time, I would have not bought it. Too expensive for what it is worth. I will not buy again."
5,Best Price,"I bought an air purifier from a shopping network, then couldn't believe the price of their replacement filters! I searched and found them on Amazon for half the price. Delivery was quick."
3,"Fine, but no multi-pack?",I like the filters but I wish I could buy them in bulk. I hate that I have to re-buy a filter online every time I want to replace one. Consider making a replacement pack of filters instead of just one for individual sale.
3,Rare Tracks fianlly out on CD!!!,"When REM put out ""Dead Letter Office"" a series of b-sides they dared you to guess what soundtrack that song appeared on...does that make this a trivial album? Maybe. But for any hardcore Oingo Boingo fan this is a must have for the rare two tracks found only here.This movie inspired director Kevin Smith in Clerks II to have a erotic donkey scene...yikes."
3,"good thing ""distressed"" was in the title","Good construction, and nice size, but a few minor problems: I've owned my case for a couple of months now, and it's starting to show in the leather. The construction is excellent, but the leather shows every scratch. Which, considering the style, isn't too much of a drawback.At first I was a little upset that the clip that holds your visor into the case was black (I own the Ice version), but I've since gotten over it. The other problem with the clip is that it doesn't hold the Visor in securely; sometimes when my Visor has been bumped around in my bag it unattaches from the clip, so when I open the case I have to reattach my visor before I use it (I don't think this is a widespread problem, since the other reviewers say that their Visors stay in snuggly).For people who want to use this as a wallet, don't expect to hold anything more than a credit card in the pocket, there isn't much room."
5,Volume 1 Episode Titles,"These are two very enjoyable episodes. The first one is ""Here Come the Monkees."" It's a cute story, where the Monkees are hired to play for a sweet sixteen party. The second episode is ""The Picture Frame."" This one is really funny. Here, the boys are tricked into robbing a bank."
2,Not the best,"The quality left a lot to be desired, For example Sing Sing Sing Benny Goodmans signiture song is cut off ! Some of the other songs sound as if recorded in a large concert hall, leaving the sound quality rather less then decent."
5,Great for kids!,Good Japanese stories such as Urashuma Taro and other stories. This book is filled with tons of fairy tales from Japan.
2,"Wooden, 2-Dimensional and Slow","This movie was filled with stereotypes and characters that just didn't make me care. The editing was self-indulgent and slow and there were several scenes that should have ended up on the cutting room floor. It is an uncomfortable movie with little warmth and an overdose of angst. The quirks that they tried to work in for the characters to make them human were very contrived and made me conscious I was watching a movie rather than allowing me to get involved in the story and characters as people. The actors did their best - but couldn't overcome the flaws in directing, editing and story line."
5,One of the most ingenious movies ever,If you like woody Allen films you will love this. All waitresses should be tipped based on how long you take up the table!
5,Louise Lasser does it again!!!,"Louise Lasser is as brilliantly funny in this movie as she was in Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman over 25 years ago. Although she has a supporting role, she fills the screen with her familiar style of comedy and sweetness. I recommend this film just because of her."
2,"Fails to create that ""Kaurimaki-mood""","Mika, the better known of the Kaurimakis, has been the most profilic movie director ever to emerge from Finland. Individual, his movies have always got some international acknowledgement. Sadly, Zombie and the Ghost Train reveals Kaurismaki's lack of inspiration and pushes the quality of Finnish film making even on a lower level. Actors, however melancholic, also express the influence of the directors boredom. This might be the one for early sunday morning after a night of heavy drinking."
1,Not for Visor Edge!!!,"It's really a great case for your Visor. Nice and soft and very beautiful. So why only one star? Well, says ""For your Handspring Visor"", and I thought that would mean any Visor. As it turns out, it doesn't fit the Visor Edge, which is why I'm returning the product. It's a shame, because my wife really loved it ..."
3,"nice shirt, but doesn't work on a woman","very nice, well-made men's t-shirt that looks exactly as represented in the product image. my only complaint is that the front-side design is placed REALLY high up. this presents no problem for a browncoat-shirt-wearing man; however, a... uh... ""well developed"" woman wearing this shirt will find the letters riding unflatteringly close to her chin, if you know what i mean.i wear men's t-shirts all the time and have never had any regrets, so i thought i'd leave this review for any female whedon fans who are thinking about showing their dismay about the alliance's victory over the independents."
2,"Love the concept, poor execution.","I wanted to love this shirt. I truly did. I was even excited for it to arrive. Then I washed it. The shirt shrunk but I decided I didn't care and wore it regardless of the new smaller size. Then the threads started to unravel. The right sleeve decided it wanted to detach itself from the shirt. Now it sits in a drawer, forgotten, all because I cannot make myself throw a new shirt I wore three times in the trash. Did I mention I really wanted to like this shirt? Find a new vendor guys!"
1,never got it,"loved the series, movie... started wearing a brown duster again... no shirt, though. nope. no shirt at all. maybe the blue sun company intercepted the shipment."
3,The music is 5 star but short compilation is injustice,"Buy his individual Blue Note albums. Whether you simply want an introduction or an efficient compilation (of someone in which you have peripheral interest), an individual album will serve you just as well, if not better. Every album contains the equal or superior of this compilation."
5,My eleven-year-old loved it,"My eleven-year-old son loved this book. He took it with him everywhere for three days, until he finished it. He has asked me to buy a copy for his math teacher to enjoy. My son also loved ""The Phantom Tollbooth"", so I agree with those reviewers who have said that children who liked ""The Phantom Tollbooth"" are likely to enjoy this book as well."
4,The number devil,"Well, this book was really interesting. It was alright to me, It was different from other books. This book talks about math more than any other books. It will teach you about something that you don't know anything about in math,and you will learn it easier if you do what he teaches you.Well, not only does the book help with math,it has a lot of metephors. Well it has a lot of funny things in it. The book is really about Robet is having dreams aboout math and the The Number Devil is teaching him. He is learning things that he doesn't understand in school. Every night he has a dream, and it helps him every day he goes to school. At the end his teacher is amazed at what he can do. IF you read this book you will find out what happens.Epiphany."
5,OK - good for children who need math inspiration,"I read this to my 4th grade daughter, and hoped my 5th grade would like it also. He was bored, but she enjoyed it, and has written her own review. For her enjoyment, and her improved attitude about mathematics, I am thankful for this book. It helped me remember some fun facts about math that make it real for children.However, I struggled reading it, becuase of its repetitiveness in dialog between robert and the devil, and because of its sameness of tone throughout. for this, I was hopelessly bored also. Read this to your children for what it is, and don't expect very creative situations. there are few.it is appealing by description, but for adult reading it is a snoozer. Perhaps it is better read by children themselves (mine are good readers, but love being read to)."
4,the number devil,I like the number because it help you with math. I think the best part is the fibocci. caran
2,No Foundation Of Number Sense,"I read this book as a result of coworkers telling me how great it was. To be honest I was not all that impressed. I am a middle school math teacher and have seen all of the ""tricks"" to solving problems. The problem is that the book doesn't give the reader a strong foundation of number sense as to why these ""tricks"" work. I felt like I was just reading a Cliff's Notes book to math. I truly was not impressed."
3,The number devil,"The Number Devil is a wonderful adventure about a boy named Robert who was having a hard time in math, and didn't like it at all. I loved all the diffrent math tricks that The Number Devil taught Robert, and how they even found ways to add a little english here and there. If I knew someone that was having a hard time in math, I would refer The Number Devil every time.Dakista"
5,Wonderful Discovery!,"I had been concerned that my ten year old son wasn't reading as much as he used to. His reading lexile has been off the chart, 1300+ I believe, since 3rd grade, so it has been hard to find books that are challenging and yet age-appropriate. He was glued to this book for the three days that it took to read it, and he actually thanked me for getting it for him. Thanks, Amazon for putting on the recommended list."
5,A Fun Mathematical Journey,"In a children's book reminiscent of The Phantom Tollbooth, the reader is taken along on a magical journey of mathematical discovery. Robert is a twelve-year-old boy who detests math, mainly because his math teacher, Mr. Bockel, is incredibly boring. To the rescue comes the Number Devil, a creature who visits Robert in a series of twelve dreams. During each dream the Number Devil explains different mathematical mysteries and reveals the beauty and simplicity of numbers. In the end, both Robert and the reader gain a new appreciation for math."
5,The Best Book,The Number Devil is a great book for any age from 9 to 1209. I'd recomend this book to anyone who likes reading or math. The reason I've given this book a five- star rating is because I love this book more than any book I've read before. I love reading but don't like math but this book really taught me how great math could really be. I highly urge anyone to read this book!
5,The Number Devil,"The Number Devil is an excellent book for all ages. Whether you are bedeviled or bedazzled by math, all readers will love this book. Enzensberger definitely succeeds at seducing even the most frustrated of pupils who aren't particularly fond of math (that would include me). This clever writer charms readers into thinking that numbers aren't little devils afterall."
4,Perfect Even for Undergrads!,"A math professor I know actually uses this book to teach a college level class and a class for advanced high school students. The book, though not a great literary piece, does introduce many different concepts from many areas of undergraduate mathematics. One potential problem with the book is that although the Number Devil mentions any facts, he never proves any of them. This presents a great oppurtunity for students as then they can prove some of the Devil's statements, like his formula for Triangle Numbers. Be warned, though, some questions that the Number Devil asks are actually still open questions in mathematics, and not even your teacher will know the answer or proof! Overall, though not a good stand-alone book, it's a great companion to a regular class that tries to introduce the students to non-calculus mathematics."
4,A puzzling and enjoyable book,"This book is a story about math but it teaches in an interesting way. If you like books where the character is in reality than this is the wrong book for you. But if you like fantasy, check it out. It takes place mostly in the main character's dreams. The main character's name is Robert. He hates math like many kids probably do. But Robert learns to enjoy it with the help of a devil called the Number Devil. He visits Robert's dreams and shows him about all sorts of ways to discover easy tricks to do math. This is a very well-written book it explains how to have fun while doing math.Review written by a 9 year old- approved by a Mom"
5,A great way to fascinate maths-minded youngsters,"My nine year old son is totally absorbed in this book. He tries to explain the concepts that he is learning to me, but I think I need to read the book also to keep up with him. It has inspired me to look for other books in the same vein in order to continue nurturing his love of maths."
1,Subscription still has not arrived.,"I bought this subscription over 90 days ago, it has still not arrived, it's now well passed the 6-8 weeks quoted. Just plain unacceptable."
1,Picture not representative,The mask shown in the picture is misleading and nothing like the mask received which is basically a very cheap plastic mask that only covers the face.
2,Not impressed...especially with the way it was packed!,"Because of the packing the ""collar"" was folded in two spots, and it wouldn't hold a proper shape and would droop automatically. The fabric was okay, but still not very impressed."
4,Suspenseful enjoyment - Loved It,Couldn't stop turning pages... the author keeps you off balance with a well-written thriller. Highly recommended.
4,well worth the effort,"Really hard to put down once you get into it. I enjoyed it so much I bought the sequel (I think that slogan rings a bell). Got to go, Games of Vengeance awaits."
2,This one is a Reach,Does not exactly live up to it's billing. There are a lot of stretches in this book. This is not a book that is going to have you staying up all night reading.
3,Did not work well for me,"This book came with high praise and I was expecting something that would keep me glued to my reading chair for hours. Somehow that did not happen.Yes, there is a lot of action, but apart from the final showdown (I won't say what it is, but what a great idea !) I wasn't really gripped. The villain gets lucky to many times for my taste and the book drags on for too long in the middle. I mean, if the good guys are preparing to catch the bad guy and you're only halfway through the book, it's quite obvious that things will not go as planned.The last hundred pages are brilliant, but it took me awfully long to get there and I was ready to give up a couple of times in between.I should probably mention that I don't like reading Tom Clancy either, so maybe it's just not my kind of genre."
5,Best Book I've read in the Last 5 Years!!,"Move over Tom Clancy - O'reilly is simply a class above!If I could buy the screeenplay and produce the movie, I would!Has multiple Oscars written all over it! Recommended to all serious readers of the genre. The Hangman's most lethal weapon is his use of unbridled sex and sex appeal. This is a very deep, psychologically complex, action thriller. You'll stay up alll nite! The final battle is EPIC; you the reader find yourself engaged in a life and death struggle of unimaginable intensity. This book is a masterpiece!!!!!!!!!"
5,shoe rack,I was a little worried that this rack would not hold enough space for 20 mens shoes (size 10) but it does. easy to assemble. Its not too big or small. Its just as it is advertised.
1,Stacking Shoe Rack is Disappointing,"When I removed the parts of the shoe rack from the box, I was not happy. This item is completely cheap. I regret this purchase. My rating was too nice."
4,surprisingly sturdy,When I got this product I thought it would fall apart (The sidebars are plastic). Once I put it together it is really sturdy. My only complaint is I can only fit 16 pairs of adult shoes on.
5,on more miss,It did help me to order my shoes. It's really excellent to me & anyone who has a lot of shoesyou will see the difference.it is easy to put together it will take lees than a minute.
3,not oo shabby,"Pros: affordable, very easy to assemble, holds plenty of shoes. Cons it's a little flimsy,but all in all a good prduct for the price."
3,A place for the shoes,The shoe racks where easy to assemble and don't take up to much room. They were a little pricy for what they are.
2,never received it!,"i did so much research and thought i found a decenty reviewed product... but now i'll never know because the seller couldn't be reached! :( i won't be trying to order again, i'm 'over it' and i'll make due with what i have."
1,BAD SERVICE AND MISSING SHIPPING ITEMS,"I recently bought one. When it arrived it only has 2 stands on the sides but the sticks to connect them together were missing! It become useless! I tried to contact with them but no reply whatsoever.bad service, bad item. not recommend!"
4,"Assembly, heels, & flats... I like it!","I am a 20-something year old woman with a lot of shoes... and this worked well for all of my shoes. It was super easy to assemble. ""So easy a caveman could do it,"" like Geico says. The only reason I would not rate it a 5-star is because when it comes to heels, you cannot be in a rush (which is usually the total opposite of my case) because you have to know how to take pull them out in a careful manner, so that the other heels don't fall off.For flats or men's shoes, however, it works more than amazing! Super easy to pull those out and place them back. Therefore, what I have done is combined the flats and heels in a sort-of pattern organization. Flats, heels, flats, heels... and so on."
5,Good Rack,"piece of cake to assemble and looks like it does in the picture. Pretty sturdy too for heavier boots, heels, etc..."
2,"Works, but description is misleading","The item was promptly shipped and received however upon opening box realized the moment I saw packaging that this unit was a rip-off. It is metal, however thats just the rails, the end caps that the rails fit into are plastic. The assembly was easy as pie, it only took me 2 mins tops, so no complaints there. The only issue is that its flimsy feeling. I was however able to load 16 shoes and then pick up the entire rack to move without it coming apart. The shelves are space tightly vertically, so items like boots will only really fit well on the top row. This item is just okay, nothing to be happy about and nothing to be upset about. I would have preferred something more stable and something completely metal or wood. It does get the job done, probably should be cheaper and more accurately described. Remember it only fits up to 20 menaing the bigger and wider your feet the less it'll fit."
4,finally organized shoes!!!,I used super glue the very first time I put this together and it's holding up really well. I love that I finally have my shoes organized in my closet.
3,This is not the entire program,"This DVD is not 90 minutes long as stated on the Amazon site. It is a 30 minute promo version of the entire extravaganza which is available on DVD as""Christmas with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir and Orchestra at Temple Square featuring Sissel"" for a higher price.The selections are:A Christmas overtureBring a torch, Jeanette IsabellaIn the bleak midwinter (with Sissel)Mitt hjerte alltid vanker (with Sissel)Oh, come all ye faithfulAngels, from the realm of glory (with Sissel)The image is excellent but the sound is clearly mono.The selections included on this DVD are worthy of five stars but I just want to warn the potential buyer that this contains less than half of the entire program.This DVD will leave you wanting to get the entire program."
2,disappointment,The DVD conked out every few minutes and eventually totally froze. Had to send it back and got a new one which again was problematic although not nearly as bad.Decided grudgingly to keep it.
5,Excellent SKA from Turkey,"Athena are four boys from Istanbul: Gökhan, Hakan, Ozan und Turgay which makes them officially Turkey`s first Ska Band.They started off in `The Last Breath' a Punk Band, then formed after a couple of musician changes Athena (after the Greek Goddess of war). By and by their Fan base got bigger in Turkey, until one day they were invited to start off the Istanbul gig of the Rolling Stones in front of a 40000 people crowd.Now they are absolutely huge in Turkey and made it already on the excellent Ska sampler ""United Colours Of SKA Vol. 3 by the famous German label Pork Pie Records.I am aware, it's a hard sell: a Ska band, from Turkey, of all places! Though they're good, in fact they're damn talented musicians. It's excellent upbeat Ska with some very catchy Middle Eastern tunes. I noticed my constant grin on my face because it's fun and very enjoyable to listen to, which is exactly what good Ska is supposed to do - think of Madness and Bad Manners. Now dare and order!!"

4,Illness Etiquette,"This book heightens awareness of dealing with persons suffering from major illnesses. Much of the book is antidotal, but makes the points easier to understand. It makes suggestions not only for those interacting with someone with an illness, but also makes suggestions for the ill person to implement. A very worthwile read."
1,The Etiquette of illness,I did not like her answers to questions. I did not like her attitude. She seemed to talk down to us
4,a good read,"Think I have read another in this series and liked it. This is a good one too. Father Dowling mysteries are well cone and create a lotof interest in the reader.The characters are well knowl well sketched out and mortal human beings, just like the rest of us. Enjoyed reading this mystery and so will you.J. Robert Ewbank author ""Wesley's Wars"" and ""John Wesley, Natural Man, and the Isms"""
2,But a small one at target.,Liked the smaller taggies at Target better. This was not a great material. Felt kind of cheap. Our daughter didn't even like it.
5,Daughter loves it,I purchased this for my 4 month old daughter at the time because she was always finding the tags on things. She sleeps with it every night still at 9 months old. The tabs are the perfect size for her to loop her little fingers through.
4,I would have given 5,"Comfy,light,and cute, but too loose for thin feet like mine, I feel like dragging them around.Great for pool side, or gym shower, not walking around."
3,Alec Baldwin ruins it for me,"The photography is great. But I could do without Alec Baldwin as narrator who totally ruins the experience for me. I'll take BBC's David Attenborough over pompous Alec Baldwin any day. In fact, I would take a homeless announcer like Ted Williams over a fat pig like Alec Baldwin. I thought Baldwin was leaving the US but I guess he lied. Oh well, blu ray loses two stars to what would have been fine experience except for the bad narration and human demonizing of Baldwin. If only there were some footage of Baldwin getting eaten by a great croc. Disappointing."
3,Not like Planet Earth,"This is ok to watch if you have nothing to do!!!It is just copy and Paste(Not from Other DVD)from Planet Earth,Life Etc.what I ment most of the scene in the Dvd, we already have seen in other Dvd as I mentioned before and has almost nothing new to offer at all!!!I admire NGE but this one is a big disappointment!!!This DVD well deserve Two(2)Stars but given one(1)more Star because PQ even with 1080i resulation looks fanastic and not to bring Opra as a narrotor!!!!!"
3,"""The pungent aroma of hope""","The footage and music are stunning, but the narration is painful. After listening for ten minutes I tried in vain for a setting to turn it off, but unfortunately this option is unavailable.Alec Baldwin's voice is sufferable (albeit not the best choice) but the script is just terrible. ""The pungent aroma of hope."" What.Rather than pepper the facts with occasional poetic notes the script is laden with unnecessary metaphor and personification. Many of these don't make much sense. It's as if someone went a little crazy with the synonyms tool on Word e.g. describing a migratory destination as an ""inferno"" would have sat better with me if the zebra were scaling a volcano, but this ""inferno"" was a dry salt lake. Hot no doubt... but still."
3,"Great photography, but theme and narration fall short","I really enjoyed watching the images throughout the documentary, but from the start two things bothered me. First, the paused and dramatic narration style does not reach the standard expected for this kind of show. Second, as an ecologist, I was surprised with the approach taken by the director. True migrations involve long distance movement of animals from one place to another and the return to the starting point, as is the case of the monarch butterflies. However, several cases shown in the documentary do not match the concept of migration, and should be treated as simple dispersal."
4,"Excellent Nat Geo, once again","This is a beautifully filmed, nicely narrated nature series. Easily comparable to Life and Planet Earth. Highly recommend."
5,Great documentary!!!,Great Blu-Ray documentary by National Geographic....excellent material and clear image....Package on time and in perfect condition....Documentary for the whole family!!!
2,Great Migrations (Blu-ray),"The images produced by were all great. The editing and story telling were bad. Before you could enjoy one section of the story, the images are cut to another story thus making the whole video too chopped up for enjoyment. Even my 11yr old daughter was able to point out that mistake and didn't get to enjoy some of the animals and migration presented because they were stretched to long with too many sub ploys and no main story. Maybe they should re edit it with a updated version."
1,Butterflies get a star,"I agree with the negative observations. Way below ng standards. you've seen the wildebeest, you've seen the zebras, you've seen the walruses, etc.Nothing new. Butterfly sequence only one that showed start to finish migration."
5,Grow up,I had to add a 5-star review just to offset the *child* who first reviewed it. It's nature - grow up! Great footage and hopefully others will right the overall feedback score.
4,Another excellent documentary by National Geographic,"The footage is spectacular, Alec Baldwin does a great job of narrating (unlike Oprah in Life by BBC/Discovery), it is enjoyable to watch and listen to this program. I would highly recommend it, and am happy I added it to my collection. I also bought this as gifts for my family who doesn't have cable!"
4,Interesting,"Another reviewer had commented on how graphic one scene was of a crocodile catching a wildebeest calf. It's not all that bad. Sad, yes, but a fact of life for the wildebeests and just nature. It's not all that bloody or gory, not like the walruses or sharks anyway. The footage is amazing, and the lengths the photographers go to get that perfect shot is incredible."
5,TRACK LISTING!!,"GOD OF MY PRAISEGOD'S GONNA SEND A REVIVALHOLD ON TO THE YEARSWE ARE STILL THE CHURCHSINS ARE GONE FOREVERFOR EVERY GENERATION FEATURING BROCK SPEER, THE CATHEDRALS AND THE WHITESALL OVER THE WORLDNEVER THIRST AGAINTHE WORD IMPOSSIBLETHERE IS A SAVIOR"
3,Good product to start out with.,Comes with plastic case that's very handy. You can upgrade as you go along. Very good starter kit for the price.
5,Air accessory Kit,Kit was delivered on time and had all the equipment needed for the compressor that was purchased.
3,basic set,contains a bunch of basic things you will find useful to have. Check what's already included with your compressor first.
4,perfect,"The tools work great on my air pressure tank. The only thing that was a neg, so lack of directions for the tools. There are general directions, but I wish they were more detail, re: what they are for and how to put it together. We managed and now it all makes sense."
4,Works as advertised.,Everything works as it is supposed to. Case is a little flimsy and one of the latches does not close.
3,I think I paid too much,"I cant complain about the quality of the product, but I have to say that all of it is made in China so it doesn't make that much difference if you buy a name brand. I could have bought all of these items for much less but I think what I paid for was to have them all in one kit in a plastic carrying case I don't use my compressor all that much but the good thing about this tool kit is I will probably never need to buy anything else again. I plan on using some of the pieces to hook up a permanent coupler to my sprinkler system so I can winterize my self."
1,Garbage,"If this kit were $5.00 and consisted solely of the air blower then I would recommend a purchase. Thats the only piece besides the tape that worked properly. Both tire fittings worked once and then leaked air loudly and constantly from both center fittings. The extra pieces? The all leak air around the quick change. You can't get them to seat properly on a standard ball bearing quick change that you'd buy in any hardware store in the country. If you can buy the air blower separately somewhere, do that. It works great."
3,Good Starter Set,"Recently purchased my first compressor - the Porter-Cable 6-gallon/150psi unit - and added this to the order to make sure I had all the ""bits"". Seems like a decent set, but based on the quality I don't think any of the pieces would hold up to hard or constant use. However, its a good ""starter kit"" to find out what you personally really need or use before you go out and dropper bigger bucks on accessories."
3,Just Ok,"I didn't have too high of expectations when I bought this but all of the various tools strike me as just...Ok. They'll do until I can compile brass fittings and attachments from the local hardware store which I'll probably be able to mostly do for what I paid for this unit. But, for now it works."
4,Solid Starter Kit,"This kit is a solid starter kit, with the right amount of fittings to get you started and inflate just about anything."
3,Fair,Everything seems great. The case is perfect for storage. My only disappointment is the pressure gage is an all plastic type. I doubt it will hold up. Otherwise seems a great kit for the cash.
1,Doesn't fit the Master Flow MF-1050 air compressor.,"This itemMaster Flow MF-1050 Tsunami High Volume Portable Air Compressorwas advertised along with the Master Flow MF-1050 air compressor. It will not fit the air compressor.It looks like if you buy the 50 ft. yellow hose that this kit may be adaptable but will not fit the MF-50 compressorin it's ""stand alone"" condition."
3,A few handy things,"I purchased this accessory kit along with the Porter Cable pancake compressor kit. Although the kit looked like it had a lot of handy tools, I was somewhat surprised by how few ""tools"" are actually in the box. More than half of the boxes contents are adapters.Will I need them all one day? ...I doubt it.Are there a few handy items? ...yes, but if you can buy them individually for less money, I think you'd be better off."
2,Don't waste you money,While you will receive 25 pieces you will not receive all the pieces required to connect all the pieces. I receive 6 pieces exactly the same what a waste. If you are buying for the long tube to be used to blow dust out of computers you won't be able to use it until you purchase additional adapters.
1,Poor Quality - Go to Home Depot and buy the Workforce version,"The stuff comes in a nice plastic case, however that is the only nice thing about this product.The items are of poor quality. Shoddy workmanship, will break easily. I did not bother using the product, I just shipped it back to Amazon.Go to Home Depot. They have a Workforce version of this for less money, i.e. $11 and some change. The Workforce version is of better quality and will last longer."
1,Cheap Stuff Not Worth Buying,"It's not chrome or brass but a chrome sticker on garbage metal. Made in China and could not be worse.Wow, really dissapointing and not worth my time to repackage and ship back or I would. Will have to buy most of these parts again from a local store.The brand name used on this stuff must really be garbage also or they would not have let their name go out on the box."
2,PHOTOS MISLEADING,Nothing in this kit is Brass. Kit shows a female valve that is brass. NOPE. Pot metal that is chromed at best. Blower piece feels hollow. Tire pressure gauge is dinky as hell. This has china written all over it.
3,Convenient Assortment: Mediocre Quality,This assortment of pneumatic connectors contains most of the common fixtures that you would likely need. The quality is uneven and the tire pressure gauge is junk (all plastic).
3,average stuff at an average price,"The items in this kit suit my need. I purchased it along with a compressor for convenience sake. After purchase, I discovered like items at the local big box hardware store. This 25 piece kit is on the lower end of the quality spectrum but so is its price. The items it contains seem to be a good mix for the general use my compressor receives. I have had some trouble with the tire inflation tool 'sticking' in the open position after filling a tire. Tapping it on the ground solves the problem. In short, not bad for the price and convenience."
3,Disappointing,"This kit has many useful parts. However, there are no brass parts, as the figure suggests, and the pressure gauge is so flimsy you might as well toss it after opening the box. More importantly, there is ONLY 1 quick connect fitting with 1/2"" threads (I would have liked several) and THERE ARE NO 5/8"" to 1/2"" adapters. Many long pressure hoses come in 3/8"" diameter with 5/8"" fittings. Therefore, I either need a 5/8"" to 1/2"" adapter or a 5/8"" quick connect fitting, neither of which are supplied in this kit. Now I need to head to the store to buy these items to make my fitting accessories complete."
4,Handy set to have around.,The components are not top quality but the value is good compared to buying everything separately. I keep this kit handy and use parts of it often.
1,Terrible,"If you are going to create an educational item, it should be just that.Poor camera work and terribly boring.Don't waste your money. There are better and more educated people in the industry."
1,Yuck,"I wouldn't advise reading this unless you are a true history buff. This book reminds me a little too much of a poor collage history text book. This book spends too much time listing names and event, and it poorly discusses concepts and ideas that have stemmed from the past.Don't buy this book.... and professors/teachers... don't assign this as class reading :)"
5,History for those who (think they) don't like history,"A brilliant evocation of 85 years of modern Chinese history. It has been said by some critics that this is a book to read for research and not for pleasure -- an opinion I would call a neat inversion of the true situation (as I saw it, anyway): I bought the book as a research tool and, though I soon found I couldn't use it for that purpose, became utterly engrossed in Spence's fascinating narrative all the same. If you're a lover of well-written biographical history, buy this book."
3,"more like ""The Chinese Literary Intellectuals and Their Revolution""","Please read the synopsis and introduction closely - this is a book about a period in Chinese history as seen through the writings of writers/intellectuals. It is useful mostly for people specifically interested in the lives and writings of the three writers featured by the author: Kang Youwei, Lu Xun, and Ding Ling. This book leaves out much background on historical events for understanding the context of the writings. There is little information on how the Guomindang and Communist revolutions affected the majority of the Chinese population and there is especially very, very little historical information about the Great Leap Forwards. This book is not a general history of the time period stated, and, due to its focus on tracing the lives of the three writers mentioned, gives the impression that the events of the last century were dominated by intellectuals, especially writers."
2,A Book For Research,"I live and work in China and generally love reading Chinese history, so after reading reviews here I ordered several of Spence's books. His writing style in general focuses too much on minute details that are not interesting to me, such as poems and musings by historical characters (a lot of them!). If you are doing research on a certain historical person it might be useful, if you are looking for a fun read this is not it."
4,Reflection of soul Indeed!,"I got this book a year ago and indeed this book is a reflection of the soul! What people say to us is different from what they think and feel! With Body language wiz by Allan Pease, one can correctly interpret other people's thoughts by their gestures. This book has quick references as 'How To' :1. Find out if someone is lying2. How to be more likeable to others3. How to get cooperation4. How to successfully conduct interviews and handle business negotiations5. How to pick up a partnerMore n more - What I like about this marvellous book of Allan is the illustrated Gestures. The eye signals and Hand-to-face gestures are simply terrific illustrated readings and Allan sure has deep roots to indepth study of Body Language, it seems. Hand and arm gestures,way of using cigars,cigerettes, glasses, head gestures, courtship gestures and signals and more wide areas are selected which is very interesting. A good Interesting read and good to explore."
3,Useful and interesting,This book serves well as a layman's introduction to reading body language. Its method is to build up a base of individual signs and what they mean and then get the reader to practice reading those signs together as clusters. Sketched pictures accompany the text throughout and are useful. There's a chapter for the major body parts such as palms and eyes as well as behaviours such as mirroring.A great intro to get you thinking about body language and the way space is used to create a covert message - and it pays to be perceptive in life!
4,Well illustrated and very interesting book!,"This is quite an interesting book on Body Language and after reading it, it is hard not to try analyze either your own body language or others one. One particular good point about this book is that it has good illustrations. The writing is good. It's easy to understand and no complicated words are used to describe simple facts."
4,Good for the Price,"It's helpful for singers, especially beginners. You'd probably like to work with other books, dvd's and cd's (Voice Lessons To Go V.3- Pure VowelsVoice Lessons To Go V.4- StaminaVoice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breathalong with this one. For instanceSinging for Dummieswhich gives you the basics and more, plus,Singing Coach Unlimited.The opening of this DVD is about 5 minutes of info on Doc Holliday, his accomplishments, who he's worked with etc.Then, the lessons follow and they aren't arranged in a very organized manner. But this dvd does have good breathing and vocal exercises. I like that he has artists doing the exercises so I can see how others do it too.I'll check out more of Doc Holliday's work, it's nice to see techinques from different vocal coaches out there."
4,Worth the Price!,Just based on the breathing exercises alone it is worth the price of one private session!The rest of it moves kind of slow.
1,Not worth the money,"This is just a plastic stand for your wii remote and nunchuck. You have to take the rechargeable batteries out of the remote and place them in the recharge station in the back of one of the units. That's no improvement from the charger we were using before. Plus, the battery charger we currently have charges batteries faster than this thing. Wish I hadn't wasted the money for this plastic remote holder."
1,Not a Strong Sales CD,"Joe Girard was certainly a great car salesman in the 70's which is admirable. His CD re covers a lot of the basics that so many have before and that's really it. This would be a good CD to listen to a few times if you are starting out in sales. If you really want to work on your attitude you should just listen to Earl Nightengal or Zig Ziglar. For sales coaching this can't touch anything Jeffrey Gitomer puts out and Gitomer goes much deeper into tips and tactics.Joe Girard bills himself as the worlds greatest salesman and he is in the Guiness Book. His record for CAR sales is still untouched, but I doubt this record stands up to any criteria broader than that. I found it to be fairly unsophisticated and Joe's grammer is weak in many places.Make it one of the many sales books you read or listen to, but don't make it the only....or even the first."
2,"Good Story, but No Real Help","Compelling story, but adds nothing to your knowledge. He goes over the same old stuff everybody does. I've heard much about him, but wasn't impressed.Very Dumb Title..."
2,A topsy-turvy messy autobiography ...,"Though for the most part it is a heart-felt narration of a tragedy in our history, it should not be studied or analysed past face value.The theme of the book is racism, but it's hard to tell when the author herself cannot keep a clear focus on her own life events; she tried to make the book in chronological order, but the time periods fluctuate and focus is lost.The Pro(s): An autobiography giving insight into this poor young [person]. It does show how the U.S.'s demographical opinion towards Japanese plummeted and that racism is bad.The Con(s): Well, it is an autobiography written by an poorly-educated Japanese lady: no plot, poor character development, loses chronological order, and, last and probably least, is pointless."
1,Boredom...,"is the best way to describe this book. It may depecit the reality of a part of the war many did not see, but it wasn't at all interesting. So if you wish to learn something about a different part of the war, then I recommend this book. But, if you wish to read for entertainment, I strongly recommend you steer clear of this *yawn* book."
1,Farewell to Manzanar: By Jeanne Wakatsuki,"I had to read this book for school because it covered the unit we were learning about at the time. It provided a lot of information on life in internment camps. Even though some of this was mildly interesting, overall I found the book extremely boring. If you are planning to write a research report on Japanese life in internment camps, it might be helpful, but otherwise I recommend you do not read it. There is really no basic plot and each chapter has a random story that isn't interesting. Also, there isn't much character development. If you like historical fiction without a plot, you'd probably enjoy this, otherwise, definitely not."
2,"At least, you got that luxury.","Do you know how cruel and brutal Japanese were during the WWII? At least you got that luxury, staying in the camp w/o working and being treated not that bad because you were in the U.S. If Japan got bombed by other countries during the WWII, I don't think they would have treated foreigners in their territory like that. They would have killed them brutely or revenged on them cruelly. Japan was incredibly crazy during the WWII. Most Asian countries suffered severly by Japan during that period. Through this book, I have realized America's generosity one more time as a naturalized citizen from Asia. Before you wrote this book, you should have studied about the ""comfort women""-the military sex slaves- and what Japan did during the WW II. I'm sorry. The author of this book doesn't seem to notice the luxury she got during the war."
1,Farewell to Manzanaar by EMC,"This book was a poor atempt at showing the terrible times faced by the Japanese in internment camps. It ended up being a book of poor charecter development with no plot. It also succeded in making internment camps sound like summer camp. On the up side if you enjoy plottless books that skip around in time with little or no transition, this is the book for you. If you're like me and prefer a book with a plot, any plot, even a small trace of a plot I recomend reading just about any other book. If I could give this book a negative amount of stars I would."
2,manzanar,"my 14 year old daughter, who is a reading fanatic, had to read this book for english over the summer. she said the book was well written but was not entertaining."
2,Farwell to Manzanar was BORING!,"The book had a few good parts but over all it was a snooze.Thought it gave great detail it wasnt every exciting and it didnt really pull me in.Generally when reading a book it usually makes you want to never put it down, well when reading Manzanar I could care less if I ever got to read it again! This book was a good historical fiction but obviously was mean't to be a thriller."
2,Boring,I really didn't get the book at all and it was hard to follow. I had know idea what was going on at all and it was complete pointless and it bored me out of my mind. I also didn't like how it would start with one event any skip on to another one.
5,Good Read,Farwell to Manzanar was a great book. It was a true story that made the book more interesting to me. The book took some cool unexpected twist and turns. The book wasn't boring at any part. Farwell to Manzanar is a historical book. This was one of the better historical books that are out for teens. The book was kept me entertained. I would give Farwell to Manzanar5/5 stars; this book was very well written.-Lizzie KMS student
4,A story about a Japanese family interned during World War II,Farwell to Manzanar is a novel about a Japanese family living in the area called Terminal Island in Southern California. Pearl Harbor was just bombed and the government ordered anybody with a Japanese descent to be incarcerated. The book basically depicts what the experience was like being held prisoners at Manzanar. The author talks about the horrible living conditions that they all had to go through. The book also shows the readers how their life was after the internment. It basically focuses on the daughter who tells the story of her life going through this tragic experience. The story tells us about her middle school and high school years after the internment.
4,A Great Book,"I read this book back in the sixth grade, and again in the tenth grade. Both times I enjoyed the book very much. I have read it again and again since then because of the fact that it is a heart warming story."
4,A well-written story,"Farewell to Manzanar is a book for all ages. A true story dealing with the bombing of Pearl Harbor and how life quickly turned upside down for the thousands of Japanese people living in America. A young girls courage and determination, her fears and worries, and her survival. She deals with the fact that since she looks different from the other kids she can't fit in everywhere. It also describes her family life and their closeness to one another and how it helps her survive. A beautifully written story that will captivate your imagination and leave you with a better and deeper understanding of Japanese culture."
3,Could be Enjoyable,"This book was written by Jeanne Wakatsuki, and has been a good learning experience for me. I learned a lot about the Japanese culture and how the Japanese Americans were treated during World War II, while in internment camps. This book was very informative, but there weren't many suspenseful parts in the book, I was never on the edge of my seat waiting to see what happened next. This book was quite slow for me, compared to books with much action and fighting. That is why I rated this book 3 stars, if you enjoy learning about new cultures then I would recommend this book to you."
4,jrw7.2 Manzanar review,"I liked the book alot, it laked some of the action that I really like but other than that it was good. Really, it was a dramatic story. I had never known much about this event and was interesated to learn more. I now know, after looking through someone elses eyes how this had affected not only the Americans during WWII but how ot affected the Japanese-Americans also.This book would really grab some of you ""intelligent need to know woth a twist"" types. It grabbed me and was a good change from the comics, sci-fi, and historical fiction I'm so used to. This is really a good book and "" my compliments to the chef!"""
5,Farewell to Manzanar,"This book is a very good book to read,but sad to. The sad part about it is that papa got taken form his family. It would be sad to lose your father,and your sons looking after your wife. But papa came back after staying at Fort Lincoln. And another thing,I really don't know why americans still whant to tret jene and her family,like they come from a diffrent plant.They can't even get a real job,becaues they speak chinese.The reason why I like this book is becaues of the real iife thats exists in this here book. I love books that has historical fition and nonfiction in it. And the way you say about Manzanar is exsiting and sad at the same time. I hope you write more books like this one."
5,A Must Read in School,"I found this book in a thrift store and new nothing about it. If this book is not a required read along side The Diary of Anne Frank, it should be. Houston writes without hatred against the U.S. government and their fear of an entire race. This allows the reader to come to their own opinion about internment camps. It is freeing to learn the truth about historical events instead of the sugar coated version learned in school. This will be on my shelf for my children to read in a few more years."
4,Life in Manzanar,"This book is written by someone who truly lived there. Jeanne tells about her life at Manzanar, uprooted from her other life and forced into a a camp for other Japanese Americans by the U.S government, believing these people might be in contact with Japan.Imagine what it would be like if suddenly, because of your race, you were thrown into a camp lacking supplies and adequate shelter. All your rights as a citizen snatched away and forced to suffer in a huge camp in the middle of no where. This is exactly what happened to Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston, who's whole family was interned at Manzanar for a few years.This story focuses on Jeanne, who was seven at the time of internment, and her perspective on life there. The families found ways to work around the hardships and get through it."
4,Dude its camp manzanar,"Camp mazanar was a really good book.It had moments that made me want to cry but it was very historical.My favorite part was when Jeanne visited the cemetery.The way she described the sand and how the wind was blowing it at her was as if it was actually happening.Camp manzanar was the best history book I have read.In my opinion it would be best to learn from the mistakes from the past and realize history can repeat itself, especially during wars.And as the wind blows we soon discover we are nothing more than dust in the wind.Camp manzanar I would strongly recommend for those who are interested in history of people during the war."
3,its ok,Farewell to Manzanar is a decent book that can at times be interesting. I don't like books like this because this can actual event that has happened and can possibly happen again. This book is very well written and overall worth 3 stars
4,Farewell to Manzanar,I liked this book but it seemed to move a little slow. I think it is neat to see what the Japanese Americans were put through during the war even though they had nothing to do with it. It's weird because they were put practically in little neighborhoods were they lived for a long time. They had to make it their home. It was also neat to know what they did in the communities and how they lived.
5,"My ""Visit"" to Manzanar","Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston and her husband, James, bring to life the story of the Wakatsuki family during the 1942 Japanese internment in California. Farewell to Manzanar (Bantam Books, 1973, ISBN 0-553-27258-6) is powerful. As a young girl, Jeanne Wakatsuki, internalizes the events that have taken place before, during, and after Manzanar. She had lived a life of ""fair treatment"" in her Ocean Park neighborhood, a life of heartache and confusion in Manzanar, and later, a life of stereotype and discrimination when she and her family left the internment camp. Although she experienced moments of not wanting to be Japanese, she grew up appreciating and understanding the circumstances in her life. Unfortunately, life for the rest of the Wakatsuki family was not pleasant after saying farewell to Manzanar, but the author gives us an opportunity to understand their pain and sorrow that political injustices caused. This is an excellent addition to add to your history section."
3,5 by 5,this book was ok but it did not get my attetion that is way i rated it e3 stars it was bad and good at the same time.
3,Not one of my favorites,"I had to read this book for my English class. Although it isn't my favorite book, it is defenitely very informative. Since this book is, of course, totally bias, I would suggest reading another book on the other perspective, so you can grasp both points of the Japanese internment.I enjoyed the descriptive manner of the book, however, pockets of it were very dull. I would not suggest reading this for a research project, god no, but rather to inform."
1,could have been better,This book was not as interesting as I had hoped. This book could have been better in many ways. I wish that the author would give a better point of view on the book. It could have had violence or something. This book is for people interested in the past.
2,Not Accurate,I know the terror that the Japanese had to through from reading other books and from what I learned in school and this book does not depict those terrors at all.
2,Farewell...,"I really didn't like the book ""Farewell to Manzanar"" it is not one of my intrest. This book was very boring to me ,it may not have been with someone else but in my opinion this book needs a little more excitement.The only chapters that interested me was chapter 10-11 these chapters interesting to me because in these chapters the father is drunk, and he tries to kill the mother but the brother of Jeanne punches him in the face , probably to knock some sense into his brain,and then the father moves away to another country for a while.That's what I think a story's setting should be.But those are my likes and dislikes about this book.(7.1HW)"
3,7.1 W.O,I did not like the book because there were too killing and softing. Families were torn apart and people were arreste and mother had to go to work the next day. Some wemen had to sell their most valueibly item just to fed their family. Families was geting bet and if some try to get a way they will get kill.
3,preception of a highschool student,This book is a fare yet slow paceing book that takes time to understand but it shows very well how the japanese were treated. The book is calm and sets it's point but also while dealing with conflicts.
4,Farewell to Manzanar,"This was such a good book! Jeanne Wakatuski wrote it great! To me, it is about the discrimination of Japanese in the years 1942-1945, during and after the second World War. Because the Wakatuskis' were Japanese, they were taken away from the home and taken to Manzanar camp with thousands of other Japanese. Though Jeanne was young when she and her family were taken to the camp, I was surprised she remembered what happened, her experiences at the camp, and after they left. It is a shame to me that some Caucasions treated the Japanese people differently.I was, however, glad that after Jeanne's family left the camp, that she made so many great accomplishments; majorette, carnival queen.This was really a great book...almost as good as the Diary of a Young Girl (Anne Frank)."
3,I would of liked it if i read it faster!!,The book Farwell To Manzanar was picked out by are teacher. I would of like it if we read it faster. I think the author talk to much on non important stuff at the end she rush to the end of the book which i did not like
3,Internment Life,"The book ""Farewell to Manzanar"" focuses on the lives of a Japanese-American family during World War II. There were lots of details about their experiences in the internment camp. We followed this family's life before, during and after internment. There were many ups and downs. Each family member had a story and even though they were a family, each story was different.Although we were at war, many Americans did not want Japanese-Americans interned in camps. Many believed this was inhumane and unconstitutional since they were Americans.It bothered me that the book was written with a racist theme.I also didn't like how it skipped through time periods. It was very easy to get lost in what was happening.I would not recommend this book for light reading. If you are interested in the Japanese-American internment camps then this book does give a great account of what happened to a family during the 3 years the Manzanar camp was open (1942 - 1945)."
5,Great,"I was assigned to read this book in seventh grade. I read it in two days, I couldn't put it down. This book is a great read for all ages, it is a very mooving and powerful book."
3,it was ok,The book was good. I had to read it for a colloege history class. But its not the kind of book I would pick up and just read for the heck of it.
4,Farewell to manzanar,"I think that this book was sad, and intresting at the same time.I think it is sad because, they didnt have ahome and barely any friends. I think this boko is intresting bacause, the most impotant thing to the was to communicate with each other.In this book it was sad to me because they didnt have any friends or a home and the book said they couldnt go back home cause they do not have a home . When she finally found some here to stay the other kids at her school didnt think that she could do the things that she did.The intresting part to me was when the book said that they couldnt communicate and they didnt have a kitchen or a kitchen table, but the weir d thing was that was the most important to them.7.2 K.W."
3,Farewell to Manzanar,"I thought this book was all right in some points. Like when their father was arrested and accused for being a Japanese spy. Then when Jeanne Wakatsuki was mad at her dad because she didn't like the dress that she had for the prom queen.My evidence from the book was when they were in the house while the bombing was happening and they were saying, ""...Japan and war..."" When they were living in the camps and the army came into their rooms and they told them to get up and start working again."
3,ok,"Overall I thought that this book, Farwell to Manzanar was pretty good. It was about a girl named Jeanne and how her family is sent to an internment camp. This book describes how she feels as her family lives through the nightmare of camp Manzanar. In this story there are lots of road blocks and Jeanne and her family always found a way to overcome them. Although this story had some boring parts overall it was ok. If I were rating it I would give it three out of five stars."
4,Farewell To Manzanar-A good book for all ages.,"Farewell to Manzanar was a good book. I really enjoyed all of the detail that was put into the description of the camp. In this book, there are different chapters about Jeanne Wakatsuki going to school, dance lessons, baton twirling lessone, the living styles of her and her family along with many other adventures that have to do with friends, foes, contests and family fights.-7th grade student at K.M.S"
3,Manzanar reveiw,"I gave this book a three star rating because it was cool in some parts and a little boring in others. The book was cool in the middle but boring in the beginning and the end, I would recommend this book to someone who likes historical things but other than that it was ok."
4,it was i realy good book.,the book was a realy good book because the book had alot of stories aboutjaenne and her family and all that troble they have in the camp. the story needs a bite more action.
5,Manzanar review,"I thought Manzanar war a really good book the author wrought it well and really life like. Its not one of thoughes books that has magic and things jumping out at the main characters from the very beginning but it is quite interesting never the less. I think the author also did a good job get the other peoples point of view and telling the readers some of the past about some of the people. She doesn't only focus on the good sides of the people but also the bad sides, it makes them seem human. I think she did a good job telling the book from her chilled hood point of view and her families feelings and onions."
1,YUCK!,"No offense to the author or anything but this book was really boring!!! It just doesn't seem to stick with one situation. Jeanne's family leaves there home, goes to Manzanar, then kicked out of Manzanar, etc. It was just really boring and I was going to be put to sleep, this book couldn't keep my attention on it for long."
2,Farewell to Manzanar - a review by Emily,"Jeanne Wakatsuki is dropped into reality as the Second World War causes her family to be sent to Manzanar, an internment camp located right near Owens Valley. The internment camp pulls her family apart, and the rages of her father don't seem to help the wounds that her family has suffered. Everything turns upside down as her father turns into an alcoholic, and America drops the bomb. Her dad won't let her do anything she wants, and least not now. Between the crazy bathrooms and the rush of the mess halls, Jeanne and her large family can't wait to say farewell to Manzanar.This is an amazing true story, and the details of the story paint pictures of Manzanar in your mind. It's very informative, and will hook you in, but might lose its grip on occasion. I was tempted to skip a paragraph every once in a while, and the book really slowed down at parts. I think that this book is only okay."
2,Format Problem,"This is a wonderful book, meaning the story itself. However, listed as a hardback, I expected hardback quality inside and out. What I received is basically a paperback with a hard cover. The paper is poor quality and when opening it, you feel like you are reading a paperback of 20 years ago. I am not happy that there is no way to know the quality of hardback you are paying for until you receive the product."
2,Not very interesting....,"The Manzanar book was kind of slow for my taste. This book is about a young girl whose family is sent to an internment camp because they are Japanese. I could see the point of writing this book and I respect that but it didn't have what it takes to keep me interested. There were some good parts that I liked but there were very few. I liked the part when Jeanne went to the cemetery and how the author really described the whole scene, the wind blowing, the kids not being old enough to respect it, the sentimentality of it, etc. That was the coolest part of the book to me. I think the author should have focused more on Jeanne's life after she got out of camp. In the end I would have to give this book about a two because it was really boring."
1,Farewell to Manzanar,Farewell to Manzanar is an ok book. It was very sad. The gov't was not fair to the Japanese Americans. I don't think the father should have been arrested and interrogated about certain things that he didn't do.For example it was sad when they saw Wakatsuki Ko looking old and crazy and he started drinking. He started swearing that he would kill mama. The Japanese should never have been sent to the camps. Thats my review for Farewell to Manzanar. 2tt
4,Overcoming discrimintation,"Jeanne Wakatsuki wrote a really good book explaining her life and the behind the scenes of internment camps. She gave a true sense of what it was like for the people at Manzanar, and made me feel really bad. The U.S was wrong for putting innocent people into the camps, and unfortunately Jeanne and her family were some of those people. This book explains how the whole family was torn apart from something they had no control over. She explains everything with good elaboration and some humor, which makes it an enjoyable and educational book to read."
3,My Thoughts.,"My thoughts of farewell to manzanar where wonderful. I thought this book was great,it was alittle confusing with all the skipping around but I was ok. I also thought it had alot of details,such as describing where they lived,the thoughts that were going through Jeanne's mind at the time. Jeanne was crying at night and talking about how she felt , and trying to keep her feelings to her self so she dosent bother her faimly.I think the book had lots of intresting facts. Especially about Pearl Harbor. The book helped me realize how fortunate I am. I feel what they went through was horable. They went from normal life style to internment camps. The brite side is I really enjoyed thes book. 7.1 AS"
2,A good book but needs a little help,The book Farwell to Manzanar is an ok book for preteens but a little to much for kids under 12.I found the book to be really confusing because the author skiped around to much.Like one minute it's 1941 next it's 1928 then 1945.Also the dialog was messed up like her father would be talking then her brother would start talking and you wouldn't know.The book is good if you were to read it for the history it has.But if you were reading it just for fun it's not that great.
3,Overall Good,"I think this book was good because it teaches a moral about not judging people by their race or ethnic group.At times the book was confusing,such as Flashback,and when there were setting changes,but overall it was good.It had alot of courage, perserverence and thoughtfullness.This is a good book if your looking for a sad but interesting story about Japanese history.There were alot of good points and feelings.Many different emotions.It's good to read this book with someone so that you can understand more.It's also good to get alot of opinons on it.This is a book that takes time to understand.It sets points while having problems."
3,my opinion of farewell to manzanar,"Farewell to Manzanar i think is a sad yet determinative story.I belive the main character ""Jeanne"" is mostly sad.I think this because in the book she gets treated like a dog,and she does'nthave her own free will.she trys to stay out of trouble and for the most part she doesI also belive she is determined.I think this because in the book she trys to keep her family together,and she never gives up.she also tries to keep the family from terring each other apart.i would recomend anyone to read this book.It teaches you to uses your pationts and teachs you to stay determined7.1 DA"
3,Farewell to Manzanar The review,"I thought your book was very good on what it was written about. I would have liked it more if it had a mystrey to it or a plot.Also if it was just a book on infomation about the war and manzanar.Im just that type of reader.It's still a great though. In the book there wasn't much action in it.I also liked it when papa whent on a drunken rampage,and also I liked the car part. The bathroom part was pretty funny.If it had more stuff like that it would be better.If you would have had diagrams and maps it would be better. It still was a great book.7.1 MEP"
4,manzanar,I gave this book 4 out of five stars. I thought some parts were interesting and some parts where boring. The beginning was the boring part. The rest of the book was a lot more interesting. The rest of the book was interesting because it was about them in the camp. It was cool to see what they went through. I never knew there were internment camps in America. That's why I liked the book.
4,Manzanar Reveiw,"Tyler and Matt, think the book was interesting and we enjoyed the book. We thought that it could be longer with more details. The book had a great message that said that everyone is equal and showed how unequal the Japanese Americans were treated in the 1940s. I understand why some didn't like because it was kind of a boring because it was not exciting. That is what Matt and I thought about the book, ""Farewell to Manzanar""."
3,My Thoughts on Manazar,"I thought that Farewell to Manzanar was an ok book. It wasn't the best book I have read, but it wasn't horrible ether. There are many parts, like her fathers drinking, that she repeats many times. After a while it starts to get boring and I don't want to hear about her father. I just want the story to get moving and tell more about Jeanne. Things like that ruin the story a bit. It was also a great book at parts though. Like at the end when she tells what happens to her life after she gets out of Manzanar. Jeanne goes into great detail and you can see how her life has changed from the beginning of the story to the end. I think that is important because you can see how Manazar changed her. I thought her life was more interesting at the end of the book than it was in the middle. Farewell to Manzanar wasn't the best but it definitely had its moments."
3,Manzanar,"This book definitely had its parts...but overall it was kind of boring!But one thing that I enjoyed was that it went into detail about the war and really told us about the Japanese culture and how it was lived. By saying it told a lot about culture I mean that it told me a lot about the foods they ate how they lived,and so much more.So I also found this book to be full of culture because it told about the Japanese ancestors the war and how every Japanese person was woven into this war.--Kate"
3,Ehhhhh.......,This book was very boring. It had a very good reason for it to be written but it was terribly boring. We all read it as a class in English and not many of us liked it. I really was fascinated by some parts like the racial conflicts and Papas story. Some parts of the book wasn't needed while the even though they were funny. This book would be great for people that enjoy boring Japanese internment books. I would read it again to learn more about this major event in American history even though it was boring!
3,Timeless affirmations,"But I thought the book was rather skimpy in length. Interesting though how shinn's words still hold true today. The message is whatever we focus on we bring more of into our lives, so we better be focusing on abundance and prosperity."
1,Religiously Silly,Had someone mentioned this book was heavy Jehovah Witness I would have saved $1.99. I found the religious tones distracting and removed this book from my e-book.
5,great story!,"i had this book when i was a kid, i'm 28 now and i still enjoy it. i recently had a baby and i've been searching for some of the books that i read as a kid so that i could share them with my son. i'm so glad that i was able to find this book! great price, fast shipping. thanks!!!!"
4,Controlling Captain Falcon,"There are times where racing strategy guides can either be a huge hit, or a big crash. That is not the case with the strategy guide with F-Zero GX for the Nintendo Gamecube. This strategy guide from Nintendo is a comprehensive and well-compiled glimpse at one of the most thrilling high speed racers ever released. The maps here are very detailed and reflect definitively on each of the over 30 exciting tracks, in the regular thrills of the race mode, and the challenges of controlling Captain Falcon in the story mode. Although most racing games don't really need the musts of a strategy guide, but if you own F-Zero GX for the Gamecube, I really recommend this strategy guide from Nintendo.Price: B+Maps: BDetail: B 1/2+Overall: B 1/2+"
3,Made in Heaven,"I used to watch this movie when i was a kid. i hadn't seen it in years! it was a great flashback in time! it's not the best movie ever, but it's worth watching."
5,made in heaven d.v.d,"Finally after a very long wait - Made in Heaven is available on d.v.d, one of the most amazing movies i have seen and have been a major fan of this movie since the 80s.well done to amazon for finally getting hold of it.karen wing"
5,The greatest love story ever told,"I first saw this movie when I was 16 years old. It transformed me from a troubled, stupid, good for nothing teenager into a lifelong hopeless romantic. At 41 years old, I still seek my girl, ""made in heaven"" for me."
5,Love this movie!,Yes - like everyone else- I am waiting for this movie to be on DVD- It is a great romantic movie and the acting is wonderful. I agree with some of the others who ponder why it did not get the credit it deserved. I have been looking for the DVD in all stores and did not know why I could not find it. It is absolutely one of my all time favorite romance movies. It is ironic that Kelly McGillis is the main actress and was also in another favorite of mine-Top Gun!
4,"Of love and soul mates, a must see!","This story of eternal love and soulmates is a must see! Whether it reminds you of yourself, or someone else, it reaches a part of you that seems to transcend the boundaries of life."
3,Intriguing Vision of Heaven,The heaven that is imagined by the writer of this story is the only heaven that I have experienced that seems like a place that I would want to go. The story of finding true love in heaven is even better than the idea of being able to be wherever you wish. I could watch this one again just for that vision.
3,A favorite romantic film,"As a child, I had a theory very similar to the plot of this movie - that God sometimes recycles good souls back to earth. I could tell which they were because they were the smartest, or had a soul-mate or got through life with the fewest traumas. As an adult, I heard terms such as ""Old Soul"" or ""reincarnation"" and they made sense. Combine this with a love affair that blossoms in Heaven, where amazing things are possible, and you have a little gem. It is a little cheesy and schmaltzy but I don't care! I have seen it a dozen times and always tear up. I will have to own it when they release it."
4,This should be released on dvd,Another one of my favorite 80's movies that should be released on dvd.
3,GREAT IDEA,"The acting was great. The directing was great. The scenery was great. The idea is great. However, I felt that the writing was weak. Personally, Emmitt smoking the cigarette in Heaven & dressed in black totally didn't work for me as cigarettes are very bad for one's health. I don't imagine people being old & graying or unhealthy in Heaven either. The story was a bold attempt with a cute ending. I deducted two stars because of the writing. I enjoyed this film more than not."
1,Bad seller,"This seller is awful, I've written 3 x and still no response. I ordered another movie from another seller at the same time and received within a couple of days. Never order from them again!"
2,I had such high hopes..........,"I really wanted to like this movie. I really wanted to. BUT -- the acting is horrible, the music lame and the plot line, while it had such potential, just fell apart. So sorry, but this was definitely NOT ""made in heaven""."
2,"wow, pretty bad","Never saw this film before, unfortunately it ended up being worst case for me in terms of how bad it was. One of my favorite directors, decent set of stars and a bunch of somewhat interesting cameos, had my fingers crossed when I decided to buy the DVD. But the story and concept were pretty hard to sit through, and that's about all I can say about that. Steer clear unless you know what you're getting yourself in for."
5,Feeling better...,"How thrilled am I after discovering that I wasn't the only one who loved this movie!? I thought most people thought it was too sappy, but I have always loved the ideas and concepts of true love and heaven that this film presents. It's a breathtaking movie, great for one of those: snuggle at home by yourself and gorge on romance nights! Furthermore, Timothy Hutton is BEAUTIFUL!!! Honestly, Hollywood doesn't make 'em like this one anymore, and that's a shame. It needs to be on DVD NOW!! Please release it."
4,soundtrack?,I'm wondering if there's a soundtrack for this film because I really enjoyed the music from Neil Young and other artists. If anyone knows please tell me. Thanks.
4,"If You Believe in Soulmates, This is a Must Movie to Watch","I have watched this movie at least a dozen times and always recommend it to my single friends when they are depressed about finding authentic love. The photography, concepts, music, acting, and chemistry between Hutton and McGillis are all superb. I was single for years and kept waiting for ""Mr. Right"" and this movie often reminded me that a power greater than myself could easily orchestrate a match-making service on earth. I won't give away the plot, but trust me it is a tear-jerker but also an inspiring movie about deep and eternal love. The only reason for my rating of four, not five, stars is that it is a little slow at times and if you don't believe in ""heaven"" as it is portrayed here, this movie might not be quite as moving for you.Kendall-Smith-Sullivan, M.A. is the author of SOULMATE LOGIC: How Any Woman Can Find Her Perfect Partner Now!"
5,Wonderful Love story,A beautiful soulmate story. The passion between Timothy and Kelly in this movie makes you want to fall in love over and over again. I gave this movie five stars because of the deep spiritual connection between the characters and their lives. The best surprise is how many famous actors are in this classic. This is my all time favorite love story.
1,Great movie - but it won't run on computer,I no longer watch movies on my TV (it's 11 years old and has no colors!) So this DVD is useless to me. When I put it in the computer - it froze up the machine and I had to reboot. I lost data in the process.
5,Touching,"Saw this for the first time when I was a kid (the release date was near my birth, that's how old this film is for me), and even though the entirety of the film didn't ""hit me"" because I - a kid - couldn't grasp all of it, it still made an impression in my memory. I could still remember the longing and emotion in that resounding theme song even after half a decade when I saw it again on TV later. I'm not big on ""chick flicks"" (don't even like Titanic) but this is one of those that are just really great. It really should be released on DVD and perhaps with a couple more languages for subtitles and I hope someone that could make that happen would see all these reviews, which obviously are only a marginal amount of all the people that wish to see that happen."
1,It was on satellite,"I'd never heard of this film, but it was free on one of the upper satellite channels and I was sick most of the day with bad sinus, so I tried to watch it. Missed the first few minutes and perhaps that was the problem, but I never could get into it. The biggest turn-off for me was the near-constant sappy background music that always seemed to be playing, sounded vaguely like jazz I suppose--oh, and then it frequently showed a woman who always seemed to be crying. A downer for sure as far as I'm concerned!"
2,DVD-R unremastered for $24? Warner Bros. You are ripping off your customers,"While we're all happy as Larry to see Alan Rudolph's wonderful Maid In Heaven finally see a digital format release, and I understand this is no mainstream film with a large following. However, Warner Bros' pricing of what is an single layer, unremastered DVD-R is contemptible.$15 max is a suitable price point for an bare bones (no extras), pressed to order DVD-R.Stop with the lazy expensive dvd copy releases. They only encourage people to download what amounts to a cheap copy."
5,a movie to remember,"I thought this was one of the best movies of my life. I first saw this movie when I was 15 and now 10 yrs later it still touches me as if I was watching it for the first time all over again.The thought of heaven portrayed in this movie is one I wish would to be true.In all reality we will never know how we are picked to be each others lifemate or how long of a road we must journey before it ends. All we know, here on earth, is that some people, some loves, are MADE IN HEAVEN! I believe this is a movie you can watch with your lover or lovedones and all will enjoy. Timmothy Hutton is superb, Kellie McGillis performance gives this movie the depth to believe in both characters. This movie will have u rooting for their charaters to find eachother!"
5,SIGH!,"One of the most romantic movies I ever saw in my life. The only thing I thought was unrealistic was that Timothy Hutton's character looks exactly the same in his next life-but I realise they had to do that-he's one of the stars- and you had to know who's who. Great story. I love the way they dipict heaven as being just like earth-except everything is perfect, and if you want to see someone or go somewhere, all you have to do is think and you're there. Much better imagery than the scenes in the more recent ""What dreams may come"". In that one, heaven was like a big painting that you had to be careful not to smudge. Check it out if you're a hopeless romantic like me, and love movies about the afterlife and reincarnation. Fascinating and beautiful. I could never get tired of this one! I'm anxiously awaiting it's release on DVD.-Cheryl Petersen"
3,Who's been writing reviews for this?,"It sounds like a bunch of NBC publicists. There is some good stuff on this DVD to be sure but it isn't the documentary itself which comes in at a meagre 41 minutes. The highlights are in the bonus material which include the 30 min. Brinkley segment that aired in 1981 (detailing Reagan's fight to institute his economic program), the GE Theater episode from 1957 that starred Reagan, and the three speeches that show just how great of a communicator he was.That said, there are some significant gaps in the material, including his 1964 speech (referred to by most as ""The Speech"") which essentially set him up as a future political star, and curious omissions in his political career (the failed nomination bid in 1976, Iran-Contra, etc.)Despite that, it's worth buying if only for the bonus material. Hopefully NBC News will come out with an expanded edition with a proper documentary."
3,Mercury remanufactured starter with solenoid,Easy transaction. Very low price and shipping costs. Quick shipment to Norway.Seller highly recommended.
1,Just read wikipedia,"This documentary provides absolutely no information that can't be found on Wikipedia. You have interviews with seemingly random people (or random Apple fans) who speaks opinion and speculation. Most of the footage can be found on YouTube. I could've easily done a better documentary than this. If you want a better documentary, watch ""One Last Thing"". That one will go through Steve Jobs life but also through the eyes of his former colleagues and friends. You'll get a better picture of who Steve Jobs was including his faults (he is known to be a tyrant among his co-workers for example). The film (""One Last Thing"") won't tell you everything but at least it gives you a better idea than this crappy movie (""Visionary Genius"")."
1,Terrible waste of time...,"I actually became angry while watching this documentary. Not because the information is totally wrong or that it isn't a little bit entertaining, but because of the terrible quality of the film. As a previous review mentioned, this looks like a high school project that deserved a ""C"". The information isn't quite in order which can be a little confusing. There are interviews with random people who really have no business speaking on Steve Jobs life. On top of that the interviews are seemingly placed in random points of the film. At one point the narrator began speaking on Jobs' break from Next to spend time with his family in the 1990s and then the film jumped to an interview with a woman on the street who was speaking about the iPad. This happens on multiple occasions in the film. That on top of the annoying grey border and the use of Moves Like Jagger, some Adele song, and Viva La Vida as background music, makes me wish I had never hit play."
5,Graciously Awesome,"The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir is simply a testament of God's faithfulness and grace from a group of people who have made prayer their number one priority. They are the most unlikely people accomplishing the most extra-ordinary things through Jesus Christ. You will be encouraged with any album and you will learn how to worship the Lord in a new, refreshing way that will bless the Lord."
4,old favorite,I purchased this CD over 10 years ago and apparently lost it. I was so glad to find a copy of it here.
1,NEED TITLE NAME,I NEED TO FIND STANDING ON HOLY GROUND. PLEASE LET ME KNOW WHICH CD OR CASSETTE I CAN FIND THIS. THANK YOU. JANET BROGDON HB423@AOL.COM
2,Not what I expected,"This CD is only pop and a few reggaeton songs. How does that represent the best of Latin? There is no salsa, merengue, bachata, or anything. I was hoping for a nice mix, of top songs from the year in every latin music style. You WILL NOT get much out of this CD. The only reason I gave it a rating of 2 is because I do like 5-6 songs on it. But there should be 20 #1s!!"
5,Now Latino 2,Another CD of the hits I dance to on Saturday nights at the club. I like having these for my car as well.
3,Interesting...but for the continual background 'noise',"Interesting...but for the continual background 'noise'. I was really glued to what Rollie and the rest of the gang were saying...but the continual obtrusive 'noise' in the background ruined this sketch of farm life for me because it often made it difficult to differentiate between what Rollie and the others were saying. If this were a discussion on 'Jazz' instead of farming, then it might have worked.I am also a grower and have been one for as long as Rollie, and so I was looking forward to hearing what he had to say. Many of the things he talked about I have discovered for myself. I would have liked to hear him talk with only silence in the backgound as is done in documentaries though....please...Rollie... RE-EDIT this video and get rid of the distractive noise that detracted from imparting your very valuable insights."
1,Don't Buy -- Absolutely NO Customer Service,"I purchased this product for a child who is fatally allergic to dairy, so it was extremely important that I confirm that dairy was not used to produce the probiotics.No one ever answers the telephone. I called at least six times and left messages three times. I also emailed them. I explained the seriousness of the inquiry in all the messages and email. That was about a month ago -- and I still haven't heard back from them.I won't do business with people who provide such a lack of customer service. How can I trust the quality of the product?"
3,worked great while it lasted,"This is an accurate scale, but the on/off button failed after a few months. This scale didn't cost hundreds, but it's more than others out there. I'm tired of these unreliable scales. GUess I'll have to pay the piper and get a professional scale."
4,Postal Scale,I needed a scale to weigh objects up to 25 lbs in mass. This scale does so with accuracy to the nearest 0.1 oz. This scale is very portable and easy to use.
5,Excellent Overview,"A great booklet that defines subliminal communication, its history and how it can be used as a self help tool. Taylor does a excellent job differentiating his work from other subliminals."
2,Once is Enough,"As a fan of Sherlock Holmes (and the Basil Rathbone sherlock in particular), I found this effort disappointing to say the least. It reminded me of those corney old black and white serials they used to play in between movies in the old days. The sets were cheap and the acting rather tired. I would only buy this version if you were a collector and wanted a complete set. I have watched many of these Sherlock Holmes over and over but for this one, Once is enough."
3,Good yarn weakened by poor script but saved by actor's charm,"Rathbone and Bruce didn't have much of a script to work with, but they saved the film as only they could have. Rated three stars because of the Rathbone/Bruce charm, and the great photography of New York on the way over the Atlantic. However, for those who have seen most of the Rathbone/Bruce tales, they may get confused by the inclusion of two former Dr. Moriartys as two completely different characters. I am speaking of Henry Daniell and George Zucco. Highlights include a wonderful moorish device with a surprise for grave robbers and Rathbone's impersonation of a incensed antique collector. As all the rest, it is completely enjoyable; however, S.H. in Washington lacks the usual side plots, and is unfortunately too predictable and quick. The plot, but mostly the script, does not allow for the best Holmes/Watson team ever to shine as brightly as they often did."
3,Holmes Across the Water,"Holmes heads stateside in this series entry that doesn't introduce Rathbone until about 15 minutes into its 70-minute running time. Again, Rathbone affects a terrific disguise as a fussy antiquarian. The great reputation his portrayal as Holmes enjoys, tends to overlook his many deft comic turns in bits like this.The picture has a McGuffin plot device concerning a book of matches that may not be exactly Hitchcockian, but it's terrifically rendered.Yet another stirring wartime sign-off."
1,"If you've never heard of Winston Churchill, this CD is for y","Very disappointing. Much of the narrative spits out facts that everyone already knows. Most of the rest is decoration, trite commentary and superficial philosophizing. The piece on Bill Gates is typical. It was delivered in a contemptuous tone, skipped the exciting history of Microsoft, and even dismissed ""The Road Ahead"" as trivial! Similarly, Iacocca's piece on Henry Ford does not even mention Ford's infamous bigotry. In fairness, I must say that I did learn a bit about the lesser known people, and enjoyed the imaginative piece on Gandhi. On the whole, though, if you've ever heard of Winston Churchill, this CD will probably bore you."
2,This is not hyper-calvinism!,"Though I enjoyed the book as a review of Spurgeon's theology, the title is a misnomer. What Spurgeon and Mr. Murray are actually attacking is consistent, biblical calvinism.The kind of theology being presented by Spurgeon and Murray is sometimes known as 'hypo-calvinism' (see trinityfoundation.org), where G-d is seen as electing only some people to salvation (true), but at the same time honestly desiring the salvation of every single individual in the world (false - see Proverbs 16:4, 1 Peter 2:8), and where His grace is divided into a higher kind (shown to the elect) and another lesser kind (shown to everyone else).Without getting into the arguments for or against the theolgy, I wouldn't reccomend this book because if you haven't looked at the issues of supralapsarianism and infralapsarianism and a host of other complicated issues, this book will most likely prejudice you against the true gospel and true biblical calvinism."
2,Politically correct does not equal solid scholarship,"Some respected and well known social scientists have contributed to this volume. Nevertheless, I do not consider it a balanced perspective of this still controversial research area and I would not use it for any of the classes I teach. At some point in the future we will look back on this period of scholarship in anthropology and wonder why we struggled so hard to come up with popular answers when other conclusions were equally indicated. Solid social science steps outside the constraints of cultural popularity/political correctness at any given era. Yet, it is understandable that many of these papers do not. Alternative explanations do not easily find publication and are often derided by one's peers. At best, this book joins a growing pseudo-scientific literature about human sexual expression and the social and cultural environments in which it occurs."
3,"Good book, however...","This is a good book on biblical hermeneutics. However, I own a copy of a book published in 1960 and authored by Dr. J. Edwin Hartill called ""Principles of Biblical Hermeneutics,"" which text is very similar to Cambron's. Since Cambron's book was published in 1983, I can come to no other conclusion but that he borrowed a great deal of Dr. Hartill's text. In some portions the text is verbatim. Plagiarism?"
5,at the old ball park,is as expected arrived promptly very satisfied and price was good. one suggestion to seller you may want to remove sale price stickers on products before shipping. i found that amusing. even though my neice loves the game and i am glad that she wants to play with something that does not require electricity to use. she loves it.
4,Good,"When i got this, i was expecting it to be put together and ready to use but, it wasn't. The assembly wasn't too hard though, all you have to do is put on the legs underneath and the backing with the Mets sign on it. The backing was hard to put in because it has to be in exactly right or it won't fit. After it is put together it is fun to play with."
2,Very Unremarkable,"Basic Premise:Women, youth, and the poor have been marginalized. The Church should do something about it because to fight for justice is to do the work of the Kingdom. Do you have to read a book to know that?But I have a copy I am selling if you do want to read it."
5,You wouldn't regret your investment,"Honestly, I wasn't a fan of apala when I was growing up in Lagos, Nigeria. However, there's no way anyone could deny the majestic presence of this kind of music-especially Haruna Ishola-in that city in the 60's. Let me tell you something, this compilation takes me back to my childhood. When I was walking back home from my elementary school at Lawanson to Itire. I couldn't believe how much I knew about this music until I (just for the fun of it) bought this CD. I've played it non-stop for 72 hours-at the office,in the car,at home, everywhere. You know what! I don't care if my wife likes it."
3,Earring Stands,"The metal backs used to hold the stand up keep breaking off. Out of the 10 shipped, only 6 still stand. I'll have to break out some glue to put the others back together."
2,"Good product, frustrating merchant","The product was fine, but I was taken to the Amazon site to check out, without realizing it. There was very poor communication on the part of the seller as far as the item listing, and extremely poor response to my complaint."
1,Totally Disappointing movie - Never watch!!!,This Film has nothing to say about the mysterious Maya civilization.Wish I could rate it as negative.Poor cast and there was very very ridiculous plot.It is more boring than a silent movie.The actors are horrible and know nothing about acting.Don't watch it even if you get a free rental!!!
1,Waste..unless u want some fair views of underwater caverns..,Terrible acting...stupid plot.....couldnt even sit through the whole movie...only watched bits while channel surfing. Best way to watch it if u must.They must have offered Michael Madsen and Keith david a free vacation!
4,Good Political Thriller,"A good book. I was interested in this book because I wanted to check out other books written by the author of Seven Days in May.I love political thrillers and I think anybody else who loves political thrillers will enjoy this book also. The setting of the book is in the 1960's maybe early 70's. The reader will probably recognize this by some of the pop phrases in the book such as ""groovy"". I don't want to give the plot away because there are some surprises. If you enjoy political thrillers,Tom Clancy novels or the recent movie The Contender you will not be disappointed."
3,"A solid, helpful rendering.","As an amateur pianist, I often refer to recordings for guidance and inspiration. This straightforward rendering of the complete -- and somewhat obscure -- works of Janacek is highly valuable for this purpose. For pure listening pleasure, the more nuanced selections recorded by Leif Ove Andsnes are superior."
3,heavy handed,Too much piano thumping for my taste. Not the Janacek I deeply love. Half way through I switched it off & went back to the Tirimo recording. Much better!
4,Good background music,"I am amazed that Janacek could produce such delicate music, after listening to his operatic output. Where others find variety, I find repetitiveness; However, the effect is never less than beautiful. Autsbo is an excellent performer and the set is well worth its price. But for rippling fireworks, Smetana!"
5,Excellent product,I really enjoy using CMT router bits. The quality that you get will justify the additional cost with proper care they will last forever. I use one set of bits for over 20 years and they are still working fine
2,Dopp Kit,"""pleather""quality not the greatest. price tag on product was less than the sale price through Amazon."
1,Inaccurate information with a few nice pictures.,"I looked through this book at a bookstore. The text lacked substance and half of the picture captions contained inaccuracies. The writers and editor obviously did not know anything about the subject matter. For example, a picture of two foals was labeled ""mare and colt"" and a halter was described as a bridle. I would not buy this book."
2,Techno and Melodic Trance but...,I was looking for Trance and really techno that goes with stable mood. Many of the Tracks are good but allmost all not that bushy to listen to again and again... I don't really recommand it for someonw with multi track fan...
2,Monster Crossword Puzzle,"At work, our daily newspaper cut back to 3 days a week, leaving the group of us who delight in crossword puzzles at break time with two days of no puzzles. I thought this would fill the gap for a long time.But it was rather disappointing.... no challenge, and somewhat dated. So it is now in a back drawer for when someone is really desperate!"
1,Defective,"This looked like it was going to be a good part, but once I put it on and started the engine, I noticed a major wobble in the pulley. When I took it off I saw that the holes were drilled nowhere near center. This part was defective, and of quite low quality. I returned it and won't be buying this brand again."
5,YOU GOT TO LEARN SOMETHING,You have to learn something from this book especially for a newbie in computers. Easy reading and priced just right.
3,"Nicely made, poor paint","Nicely detailed dolphin. Makes a great bath toy. But the paint is already wearing off the fins after a month of typical play.--Update, a year later the paint is significantly worn all over the dolphin. Looks terrible. She has only played with this in the bath. There is no reason for the paint to be wearing off. I'd give it one star for durability, but I can't edit that part of the review. Try a different brand dolphin toy."
1,too small for ya'll,"bought this for my 4 yr old daughter... paid $8... so small it could be used as a key chain charm, or perhaps a charm for a charm braclet - what a rip:("
5,FOURPLAY TRACK #10,AS ALL WAYS THIS GROUP OF MEN HAVE DONE IT AGAIN. THIS SONG REACHED OUT AND JUST TOOK ME AWAY.
2,Much too smooth...,Unarguably these are classy musicians. Open the sleeve notes for this album the credits are:Bob James - PianoNathan East - Bass and VocalsLarry Carlton - GuitarHarvey Mason - DrumsI considered giving this 3 stars. Yes there is some lovely guitar playing from Larry Carlton and occasionally Bob James plays some real Piano but this is mostly like Jazz FM when it stopped playing Jazz and became Smooth FM (in the UK). If you liked that you'll love this.I found it to be over-produced and soulless - you have been warned.
1,Dont Buy it,This is recycled Smooth jazz(Really not all that smooth) that we've all heard over and over.I would expect more with Larry carlton in the band but this album is completely lacking in emotion and musicianship.I have a few of the Older Fouplay Albums with Lee ritenour on guitar.I would suggest a newcomer to buy one of those albums.Russ Freeman and the Rippingtons or Spyro Gyra are more melodic and closer to what Fourplay used to be.They would be great choices as well.
5,The Best Ever!,"I LOVE THIS CD! Espectially the song ""FOUR PLAY"". This is a great great great CD to have in any music collection! You will enjoy it!"
5,Great CD,Fourplay is one of my favorite jazz groups. This cd is simply great! I listen to if often and loaded on my iphone to listen at work.
5,Fourplay does it again!,"This CD is a compilation of four of the greatest musicians ever. The flow is so smooth and the tracks so diverse and well constructed, it is no wonder why this band is so incredible. This is jazz at its best! Buy this tape and prepare to be blown away by four masters of their respective instruments. Enjoy!"
4,fourplay does it again,"fourplay has crafted a marvelous piece of smooth jazz, much to the credit of their longevity. this album will sell better than the last, due to the tightness of the group."
1,A disappointment!,"When Larry Carlton replaced Lee Ritenour, I was excited about the potential of this band to add some excitement to the ""smooth jazz"" scene. One would think his more aggressive style would push the band beyond their rather bland previous work. But, what a disappointment Yes, Please! Is!!! This is hardly ""rambunctious"" as suggested in the Amazon.com review. It really isn't even good background music. BORING! The only track worth a listen is Blues Force. After that it is just annoying. This group is just coasting and I feel they will never achieve their potential after listening to this CD. Hopefuly seeing Larry Carlton in concert next month will get rid of the bad taste I have from listening to this release by a highly talented collection of individual performers."
5,Like it.,My dog doesn't mind wearing it and it keeps him warm. Its durable and easy to take on and off quickly.
5,Better than expected!,"Very timely shipment, and the product is better than expected. Our dog LOVES it, and it really does keep him warm when he's outside. Doesn't choke him. Fits great! Great price."
5,Dog Jacket,Product arrived as expected. New Condition. Fast shipping. Glad we ordered the XL size for our American Bulldog. Thanks.
2,Dog's coat.,"The coat is of poor quality materials and bleeds in the wash. I would not recommend it for use in the rain, especially with a lighter coat dog. But you get what you pay for, and this coat was extremely cheap when compared to store quality coats ($14 vs. $50+)."
3,My Active Dog,"I saw this jacket online and it received favorable reviews. The styling of the jacket is attractive and my female boxer gets compliments when she is wearing it. However, I have a few complaints that are functional.First, when I used the jacket the very first time, the hook and loop fastener on the chest came off. The stitching was not strong enough and I had to handstitch it back on to use the jacket.Second, the hook and fastener on the neck is useless if your dog is active like mine. Whenever she runs or even sniffs the ground, the jacket comes right off. I have to then spend the next 5 minutes trying to put it on her and secure it with her harness.Third, the opening for the leash to collar connection has torn open at the stiching. Oh, by the way, I have only used this jacket about 10 times since I bought it.So, if you have a dog that just walks along with minimal movement, this is the jacket for you."
3,PLEASED,ORDERED XL DUE TO COMMENTS-JACKET FITS LONG (NECK TO TAIL)- COVERS TAIL OF 65 POUND BOXER. NICE OPENING ON TOP FOR LEACH TO HOOK TO COLLAR. NOT MUCH UNDERBODY WARMTH--ONLY VELCRO STRAP
5,nice jacket -- good for cool (but not supercold) weather,"Coat is a little thinner than I thought, but nice-looking and perfect for cool (though not freezing cold) days. We like it."
3,not all fleece,"This product is well made, but it is not all fleece...only the inside is...the outside is a faux velvet type of material...also the size is not correct...I used the information providedto choose the right size for my pup, but this coat is very long."
4,good buy,"I like the coat, however, I should have ordered the x large.The velgro in the front keeps opening. I had to sew a longer pieceof velgro in the front. Had I ordered the xlarge and I don't thinkI would have had that problem. Overall it a very good coat. My dog getslots of compliments."
4,warm and comfy,"Good coat. I ordered an XXL for our 1 year old 90 pound Rotweiler and its big, but he will grow into it. I like the fleece underneath, but I am not sure the brush velvet top is going to be water proof? Its great for snow and cold weather, I just have not had it out in the rain yet."
4,Doggone Good Dog Coat,"This appears to be an excellent dog coat -- however, my dog hasn't worn it yet... After reading all the reviews, I decided to get the X-Large for my Black Lab/Golden Retriever dog. However, she's still a ""puppy"" (just about seven months old right now), and the coat is considerably too large for her (both length-wise and around her middle). I hesitate returning it as I really think she'll grow into it -- I just don't know how long it will take! In the meantime, she seems to be enjoying the cold weather/snow even without her new coat -- ""puppies"" can take it better than ""senior dogs."" I would certainly recommend this seemingly well-made coat for older dogs, and I believe my much younger one will enjoy it too once she reaches full-size."
5,Great coat,"Casual Canine Velvet/Polyester Reflective Dog Jacket, Large, 20-Inch, Red This is a great coat,looks nice...Was intended as a gift,so I can't say much about fit and comfort."
3,Reflective dog jacket,The jacket was much bigger than I expected so I had to use it on my larger dog but the price was great. I ordered a medium because the smalls in other brands are too little.
2,Picture/Description Not Helpful,"This would have been exactly what we were looking for, except that it was way too small for our 45 lb. lab/collie mix. I ordered a Medium, as my dog is Medium-sized and the picture shows a similar-sized lab in the jacket. When it arrived, I was disappointed to find that the coat would not even clasp, and the material was a costume-y velvet material. I wish the site had a better size chart that used weight, as well as a more helpful picture that reflected the size of the jacket advertised."
1,dog vest,"This was good quality but didn't fit our small sheltie, larger size would be too big,return was very easy for this dealer"
4,cool canine style.,"My labrador retriever was jealous of her smaller companion's coat. This attractive, easy to fasten jacket was just the thing to keep her warm and comfortable and decrease the sibling rivalry."
4,Nice Coat,"Nice coat. Stays in place. It's soft and pliable, so my dog sleeps in it as well and it really helps keep him warm. FYI for sizing information, X-Large was too large for my Boxer."
3,"neck runs a little small, length ok","Unfortunately dog coat sizing seems to be a roll of the dice, This coat xxl the neck was a little small for my dog.length was fine, I have an XL from another company which has approximately the same neck opening a lot shorter length though.I don't know why these companies cant just use a little more material and velcro in the neck to accommodate more sizes. When I put this on my dog it fits but if he sits down or flexes its like the hulk the neck comes open.The coat has kind of a crinkly feel to it also"
4,Keeps him warm . . .,"This coat is a little big on my dog who measures 15"" from neck to tip of tail. If it don't have it secured onto him just right he literally WILL NOT MOVE!! Strange, but after adjusting he doesn't seem to mind having it on at all . . . seems to keep him warm enough for the short periods of time that he is outside during the cold winter months."
4,Run large.,Nice coat but ran WAY larger than any other coat I've ever bought for my pet. Had to send it back and didn't re-order. Great for bigger dogs but for little ones? - maybe not.
2,Not true to size or fit,"I bought this for my 22lb puggle after measuring him to fit. After receiving the jacket I noticed immediately that it was a tight fit and I I had to move the jacket up towards his head to use the velcro straps. Even then the straps were snug. Because of this the jacket did not cover his whole body. I decided to use the jacket anyway and after a couple months the velcro is no longer effective and the jacket is harder to use as it is too small. All in all, the jacket is smaller than advertised and the quality of the velcro is terrible. The overall quality of the material is fairly poor. I would recommend ordering a size up or not ordering this jacket at all. Not worth the $18."
3,didn't fit well,the front strap was too short and too narrow and didn't stay fastened. nice material. got here quickly. My dog is a lab/rhodesian ridgeback cross and her chest is a little wider than normal but not bulldog wide so I was disappointed when it didn't fit accross her chest. I even tried sewing more velcro on the front but it just wouldn't work
4,Big enough for my Great Dane,"This coat in XXL is big enough for my one year old great dane...with room for the rest of the growing she will do. The velveteen-like fabric on the outside is soft, and the fleece on the inside is softer. The stitching is sturdy, and I anticipate using this coat for my girl for years. It is not what I would consider ultra-warm...mostly because the design does not cover the bottom portion of the dog's torso...but for winter in New Mexico it works just fine. The XXL covers all the way to the base of my dane's tail."
3,nice,"i loved the product but after only 1 months use, the velcro is no longer holding up and stayiong closed. perhaps this should have been made with snaps instead of velcro."
3,Large isn't that large,"I agree with some of the other reviewers who purchase the ""Large."" The large is way too small for my dog who is a skinny 50lb. The coat I received was decent quality, and it is easy to use with the velcro. However, the velcro can be easy to come off if the dog is too active, especially if the coat doesnt fit correctly to start with! I would say the large would fit a cocker spaniel or beagle sized dog. If you have a lab or similar sized dog, my guess is that you'll need the extra large."
4,Great Jacket!,"This is a great jacket. I have two greyhounds, and it is difficult to find a jacket long enough to cover from the base of their necks to the top of the tail. This one fit my 80 pound boy just perfectly. It's warm but not too heavy. He really seems to like wearing it. The Velcro closure fastens on the side of the jacket instead of across the chest/belly area. This seems more comfortable than having that scratchy stuff rubbing him. When my female needs a new jacket, I will purchase one of these for her too."
2,Josesuerte,"I would recommend against this product. We bought one for our standard poodle and the fabric color ran in the first rain we walked the dog in and turned our white poodle into a pink and white poodle. In addition, the velcro fittings are set for one size dog. If your dog does not exactly fit, the coat is always slipping off the dog. We will no longer use it and will buy something that has better quality material and a better thought out design for fitting different dogs"
4,Large dog coat,"Good quality and fits well. Dogs does not seem to mind wearing, so I am guessing comfortable fit. Thank you"
1,Fell Apart,I purchased this sweater a few weeks ago. The material was great and I was super happy on the first day. The second day the Velcro separated from the fabric up by the neck. Day four the trim on the collar came off. Day six the trim on the side and most of the back end came off and I am holding it on my dog wih safety pins. Very very disappointed and am now shopping for a replacement sweater.
1,Think Elvis in Vegas rather than effective.,I have two Pittie mixes who HATE the cold....this jacket was the only one available because the Kakadu coat is always sold out. My dog ate it in a little under 30 seconds and looked ridiculous in those 30 seconds. Save your money.
3,In the Pink,"Rated this @ 3 stars because the material bleeds red/pink when wet so if your dog is white & male he's gotta pull up his big boy pants to be man enough to be pink. I've hand washed this over a dozen times, while the rinse water isn't as deep red as the first few times the coat still bleeds. So far my pooch hasn't been in a downpour so I haven't needed to bathe him immediately on our return.Bought the coat to help keep the majority of his body dry & warm which it does. An added bonus that I didn't think we really needed is the increased viability both day & night. He's only 2 feet tall and chocolate brown (Bassador) tends to blend into our urban environment but with the coat he attracts attention.Love the pocket which I keep stuffed with extra bags for poop patrol and the opening on the back of the neck to attach his leash."
3,Get 1 size larger than you think you need.,Not really waterproof. If a shower hits when walking it soaks through as its just thick felt and fleece lining. And the sizing charts are off by a size.
4,good buy,fits well on 40lb lab mix - helps to have reflection for black dog on winter mornings....will keep us both safe
3,Underwhelmed.,"It's a nice looking jacket, and the reflective tape is great, but there are a couple of things wrong with it. Ironically I just bumped into a co-worker in the hallway who confirmed this behavior, so it's not just me. First, it tends to slowly but surely wind it's way to one side or another, so your dog ends up half-covered, and my dog doesn't like it when it gets too far wound to one side. Second, the velcro connectors don't work very well, particularly after a couple of months. They stick to the fleece liner and not to the opposing velcro strip, and in fact one of the strips is actually coming off. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Great for the dog,This coat for the dogs really works great. It stays on thight on my Dalmatian/American Bulldog mix and my Black lab/Pit Bull mix. I did end up odering the wrong size but the company replaced them very quickly with the right sizes.
2,"Runs small, not very durable for active dog",I purchased this for a 50 lb pit bull. The velcro barely fits over her neck and doesn't fit around her chest. Neither seem that they would stay put if your dog is active.
2,Dog Coat by Casual Canine,I was disappointed in this coat. It is too thin. Check out my dog product review blog to see what I thought about this and many other dog products![...]
4,Happy with my purchase,"Now that I've seen the coat on my dog, I can comment on the material, size and quality. So far, I'm happy with the purchase. The material has a suede like finish on the outside. The inside is a fine fleece (like a sweatshirt).My dog (a 70# coonhound) doesn't need much when he's outside because he's usually running around. This sweater seems soft enough, and thin enough, for indoor usage during the day when I set back the furnace temperature, as well as providing enough additional coverage to keep him comfortable in the winter cold.The reflective stripes seem like a nice bonus. I'm glad I followed the other reviews and ordered XL. It fits him well - large wouldn't have been big enough."
2,Not good wet,"I purchased this jacket for my female yellow labrador retriever. We tried it out this week while we were experiencing unseasonably cold rains. The jacket covered her well, but it became soaked by the rain, has no moisture repellency. The problem was that the jacket took 24 hours to dry out. This was not a downpour of a rain, but more like steady showers. I am convinced that this will be a problem when snow fall is a factor. I would not buy this jacket again and I would not recommend it for others."
3,Nice looking but....,I have a large dog and tried two sizes.... Both keep coming undone then start falling off.This product needs a redesign with better fasteners at least for large breeds.TW
3,Fits big,"I purchased this item along with another coat for my dog...same size in both. While the pullover fits perfectly, this item fits large on her. My dog is long and lean (weim/choc. lab mix), and although I was instructed on the amazon site what size to purchase, I should have ordered a size smaller."
1,"Gone, first time out in the snow.","I assume the Velcro did not hold once it got wet, but my dog returned from the woods without it, wet, and shivering. Would not recommend or purchase again."
3,Great...but...,this really is a good jacket everything about it but we used the jacket so often that the velcro is starting to not work so my dog tends to slip out of the jacket
4,Great warm cozy user friendly coat great for any dog,"This coat is very user friendly. The dogs don't mind it a bit. I have a lab/sharpae mix= 65 lbs and the xl is too big for him. The velcro pocket is nice to put plastic baggies in and the light flasher--seen at night. The coats work well in the rain, but will eventually soak through...we live in Seattle and they work great! The reflective strip works. Machine washable, line dry or low temp heat. My only issue with the coat is the strap around his tummy slips a bit and the coat ends up slidding off to the side. I put his safety collar from the leash through the whole and then clipped it to his collar and that seemed to stop this"
2,Nicely made but online sizing info wasn't correct,"A nicely made doggy jacket (red velvetine exterior with pocket, reflector stripes, and gray fleece lining). After some tailoring (shortened torso length and belly strap), it kept my geriatric dog (approx 55 lbs, german shepard x) comfortable on chilly mornings.The jacket had to be tailored to fit him because the sizing info provided didn't adequately (or accurately?) describe it's size. I was concerned about purchasing an XXL for a 55 lb dog. But the nape-of-neck to base-of-tail distance (24-30 inches) was ok and having no experience with dog clothing, I decided to err on the side of getting something too large. Whatever. It would have been helpful if the online jacket's spec's had included a list of some common breeds of dogs that this size usually fits (cocker spaniel? golden retriever? great dane?). The photo was of a yellow lab which was probably roughly similar in size to my dog........."
5,Great looking product,I bought this for my dog a year ago and he gets compliments every time..... He looks soooo cute on it!
4,So cute!!!,"The front velcro strap seems to pop open all the time. But, other than that the jacket is great. I get so many compliments on it and the reflectors are a life saver (literally). It's not bulky but still seems warm."
4,Works for us,"Item as described. Additional description from me: fleece is soft but thin, 24 inches from anterior side of leash hole to back of coat (tail side). My 61 lb. lab mix's back is 27"". It seems a little long on her but not too bad. The velcro works for now although I'll probably add some more because it needs to be a little tighter on her. I maybe could have gone a size down for her but the coat would not have covered her back completely (like shown in the picture). For the red felt on the outside think cheap Christmas red velvet & that is what it feels like. Really like the leash hole, ease of donning & doffing, as well as the reflective strips. Good for the price."
5,"Great Fit, High-Quality, But Does Crinkle a Lot","I'd had to order and return two different sizes of the same coat from another store before giving in and ordering four different coats to try on our mixed-breed dog. This coat was one of the four and fit the best out of them all (even though I carefully measured and followed the size charts). So, I'd say this coat is very true to size as described!The strap which goes under the belly works very well at holding the coat on, but doesn't get in the way of our male dog's ""equipment"" so he can relieve himself without decorating the coat at the same time.Our pup looks great in this coat, which is well made and appears high-quality.The only negative we've found is that the coat is very crinkly (akin to the sound dog and cat toys make when they have a crinkly part). I believe it must be the thermal lining. It makes enough noise that it confused and startled our pup at first. He eventually learned to ignore it, though."
3,Looks better than it is,"This coat is very light weight and made from a cheap material. It is fine if you want light weight warmth, but unsuitable for winter days. It also runs small so order a size up. If you want a great dog coat made of high quality materials for a great price, check out the dog coats on Dover Saddlery. They are the best!!"
5,canine reflective jacket is a good thing if you size it right!,"I was a lazy shopper and did not measure my 70+ lb. labrador retriever. so first I got a large coat that was too small- but it was so nice that my co-worker just bought it off me (for her bassett who loves it)and I ordered an XXL. oops- this time too big! must learn to measure.... the company was very good about it and I was able to return the xxl (might have fit a mastiff?) and get an xl which fits pretty good, looks great and on the very cold Maine mornings he is warmer! The company sent the first two shipments promptly while it took a little while for the exchanged one but it came in plenty of time."
2,enhancement suggestion,"I'm not so happy with the product. The ""soft side"" half of the Velcro has practically no ""fuzz"" on it. As a consequence, the coat falls off a moving dog because it doesn't stay ""stuck"" and easily detaches. The coat then slowly inches down the leash trailing behind the dog, who then becomes a bit freaked, thinking it is chasing him. Actually, it was kind of funny, except due to the temperature being so low, putting it back on was impossible with gloves on. The coat could use an additional fastener, like buttons, which wouldn't allow it to come off so easily. On a dog that isn't moving, it looks fantastic. We'll probably use it next Halloween as his `vampire cape' because it is ""spooky cool"" when on with the collar up."
3,Fleece Dog coat,I thought this jacket was really nice but was disappointed that the site did not give measuring instructions. I used measurements from a similar product from another site to pick which size I would need. Then when it came it was way too small. The price was very reasonable so I donated it to our local dog shelter and ordered another coat from another site.
5,My Dog loves it.,"My Red Heeler says she loves it, she seems to get cold pretty easy with her being short haired. Definitely a great product and does what it's supposed to be."
4,Two Years Later...,"I bought this at the doggie daycare where my border collie mix played as a puppy. It's a nice looking jacket and it wears well. My dog has been wearing it during the cold months for two years now. The only thing I would complain about is the velcro. After some time of putting on and pulling off we all know the velcro wears out. It's time to think about making jackets/coats for dogs that have snaps or side release buckles...even buttons might work. Yes, I know some dogs will not stay still to fastens those things, but for those that do, we should have more of them available to us. Just a thought."
5,Happy with purchase,"good quality, nice design, has a place for all that I need. This wallet replaced another Buxton wallet that needed replacement after 10 years."
2,too small,"the quality was great and it was neat to have all the pockets; however, when I actually tried to close it, I was unsuccessful because it was just too small to accommodate the multi-pockets/slots. returned for full refund."
5,Fantastic Product,Great product as usual from Buxton! I looked in stores all over and couldn't find it anywhere. My sister (who is blind) finds this purse to be very well organized for her needs. She is replacing her old one that served her well for years. She received this product as promised and absolutely loves it!! Thanks!
3,Just ok,Change purse is small. Lots of slots for credit cards but when the cards are inserted the wallet is very bulky.
2,Didn't like it,"I carry a medium sized handbag and this wallet was large and bulky. If you love big purses buy it, it's roomy and the large size makes it easy to find. If you are like me and appreciate a mid-sized bag pass this choice up."
3,Holds everything but it's bulky,"This is an attractive wallet but it is bulky even without all the slots filled. The slots are very stiff and it's hard to get the cards in and out of them, but I'm assuming they will loosen up enough with time."
2,bulky wallet,"This is a nice wallet until you put a 'few' cards in it. The card holder inside is made of leather type material and when you add just 8 cards (which includes the drivers license, library card, 2 medical cards, AARP and towing cards-no charge cards) it becomes so bulgy that where it snaps the space is approx 1 1/2 inches apart and will grow if more cards are added. Sorry to say, I have gone back to my old wallet as this one just does not work out for me."
3,"Item lovely, customer svc horrible","The wallet arrived in perfect condition, almost 2wks past expected arrival. The company (not amazon) had terrible customer service, blamed USPS and wouldn't take responsibility. I would not order from this company again."
5,Wallet,Great! Just what I was looking for. Lots of slots for all my cards. None of those cheap plastic inserts.
5,Well organized wallet.,"This leather wallet is soft leather, holds cash, cards, and change. It is easy to close and closes tight. Doesn't take up a lot of space in your purse."
1,Tears easily,The card slots in the wallet are too tight. You have to force the cards into the slots and then they are almost impossible to get out. I used the wallet less than a month and the sides were already tearing away. I've gone back to by old wallet.
5,A Sweet Gift!,I love jelly beans and the ones made by the Jelly Belly Candy Company are the best that I have ever eaten and this jar of assorted flavor jelly beans makes a delicious gift for any jelly bean lover and even as a gift for yourself if you love these yummy confections and want to treat yourself! I love all of the flavors but my personal favorite is the bubble gum flavor!
2,Really disappointed how small it is,"Jelly Belly makes awesome beans. No problem there.This cute little, and I mean small jar doesn't hold much more than a regular sized Jelly bean bag. The Bean part is less than 4 inches high and wide. That is not a whole lot of beans in my book. If this was 10 Dollars it would be ok, but at 19 dollars its an awful rip off and I don't complain often.Jelly Belly doesn't need to dig their hands that deep into my pockets.Don't bother with this ""gift"" until they price is corrected."
2,not good if have back pain,"Found the workout overall less intense than regular yoga videos, but not geared towards plus size women. I thought the video was going to show me how to do certain exercises in a different way so that I had no pain. However, I have low back pain and I have heard that pilates and yoga can be very helpful. However, this video was very difficult to do because I am so plus-size. They should have just called it something different than having plus size in description."
2,"So so, but disappointing","I bought this because I really wanted to revisit pilates and really liked a plus-sized yoga dvd I had bought. But the sad truth was that this DVD felt like it was for senior citizens and people with very limited mobility. I am going to have to sell it because after using a few times I was so bored and not inspired the way I thought I would be. It makes me want to stick with yoga, as I always feel inspired and refreshed. Maybe pilates is just not for me. But truthfully, this DVD was pre-beginner level. Good instruction but not a challenge even for this beginner."
3,"Look Great, Feel Great: Plus Size Pilates","It was okay, a lot of talking and wasn't very good. I switched over to doing yoga, it was more peaceful and not tons of talking."
2,Great as an Introductory to Pilates,"This is a great intro video for someone who has NEVER done pilates. However I have and was disappointed that it was not at all what I was looking for. I have done pilates in my lighter days and looking for additional pilates instruction specific to a new plus size body! Therefore I was misled by the product description. After previewing it to determine it was not for me, I would like to return it. Would you be able to assist with that return? Thanks"
3,Only did this once,"I bought this because it was recommended. I am overweight (BMI is 39) and have a hard time doing the same exercise DVDs I used 50 pounds ago.This DVD is designed for people who are completely inactive and are overweight. I am out of shape but I do farm chores (cleaning stalls, hauling water, moving hay) and have two kids that I have to chase around so I found this workout WAY too slow and haven't used the DVD except once."
1,Ummm ya right... NOT,I don't know what I expected of this dvd... But what I got isn't what I was thinking.She does the crunches that hurt our necks... and it doesn't say but it is more helpful to have someone there with you while doing it to make sure you are doing it right...Stupid dvd
2,Limitations not mentioned,"Sprayer will not handle Latex paint. This major limitation was notmentioned in any of the web based product information. However,this major limitation was listed in BOLD type in the instructionsmanual.Since the sprayer will not handle latex paint, I cannot use thesprayer."
4,It's still Dar,"I have no problem with artists evolving their musical styles and trying new things, as long as it doesn't obscure their own unique talents. This album is great; the songs and albums deliver. However, I think that if you're going to add a bunch of cool, electric stuff to dar's music, you need to make sure you can still hear her beautiful voice and lyrics. Personally, I look forward to seeing these songs live, because I hope it will be more fufilling then straining to hear the lyrics on this album."
4,Outstanding Evolution,"So I first heard about Ms. Williams from the press for her ""End of the Summer"" CD. While I can't claim to be an ardent fan, I do recommend seeing her in concert. Her latest CD actually has some songs she's been playing for the last year or so, i.e. Cry Cry Cry and solo. So I've been waiting for this release with some anticipation. It does not disappoint. I am reminded of Suzanne Vega's first two albums, when I think about how Dar Williams' music has evolved since her last CD. Purists might disagree, but I think the additional background instruments add a texture to her songs they previously lacked. Her lyrics here are as well crafted as those by Cheryl Wheeler. My personal favorite is the sentimental ""After All."" In all, I am very happy with this latest CD, and I look forward to hearing her on tour."
3,Not her best.,"I adore Dar Williams. I find her music to be introspective, thoughtful, lyrically beautiful and true-to-life, and musically sound.This is what I expected from The Green World, but sadly, I was a bit disappointed with this album. While many of the songs (After All, Calling the Moon, We Learned the Sea) are simply beautiful and have excellent lyrics, other songs just don't suit my tastes. This album is very different from Dar's earlier work; it definitely has a more ""country"" sound to it, which I don't care for. I enjoyed Dar as the folk singer/songwriter she was in the early days, and this CD seems to have lost some of that integrity and eagerness of the earlier albums.Nevertheless, it's not a terrible CD by any stretch of the imagination, and in the right mood, I do enjoy it. However, it is much different from Dar's other albums, and the potential listener should be aware of this before purchasing this CD."
5,Dar's best...Sort of,"Yes, it's ""different"" than her other albums. Yes, it's a slicker, richer production. No, it's not as ""folksy"" as her earlier work. But The Green World is easily Dar's most listenable album. There's not a bad track on it.On the other hand, while every track is good, there's also not a single song on here that stands out as much as ""When I Was a Boy,"" or ""The Christians and the Pagans,"" or even ""What Do You Hear in These Sounds?""The Green World is bright and refreshing, and if you don't mind the lack of truly stellar points, you can't go wrong with it."
5,She Sings My Life,"Okay, so you listened to Honesty Room and Mortal City and fell in love with Dar. At first, The Green World may dishearten you because her sound is quite different on this album. But if you listen to the songs, you realize that Dar is staying true to form. I hate it when people use the word ""pop"" to describe her music. ""Pop"" music is about entertainment and appealing to the masses. Dar Williams uses music to tell stories, to evoke emotions, to relate to real people living our lives. The Green World continues in this vein.Dar's new album, The Beauty of Rain, is due out February 18. Critical acclaim of that album says she ""picks up where The Green World left off,"" but I think fans of Mortal City and Honesty Room will be pleased. She refines her old style in Rain, focuses more on the intimate details of the individual stories. ..."
2,So sad,"You know, I am a HUGE Dar Williams fan. And I continue to be, barely. This CD seems to be such an effort at getting the mighty buck; it sounds just like all the other folk-rock-pop artists out there without the ability to differentiate. This CD is such an absolute departure that it actually saddens me, it pains me to know that an artist who I care about, one with so mucy to say, would sell out and be like all the rest. It makes me gag.I wish there's a way to tell her and her manger/producer that this is a failure of self. I think she's been duped into thinking this will help her career. Perhaps it will, because the masses to which she never attracted, will buy this one just like anything else that has a certain overly-produced sound.I'll pray she finds better counsel. But the bucks are probably too atractive.My only saving grace is that the words (and the words only) are sometimes still spiritually alive and honest. But, that's only half of the art of music."
3,A Dissapointment,"I have no objection to Dar Williams taking a more pop approach on this album, in fact some of the best songs off of her previous album, ""End of Summer,"" were the more upbeat pop songs. However, the problem with this album isn't in the pop approach, but in the song writing itself. The tunes are generally mediocre, and the over-production seems to try and cover that fact. Perhaps if the barage of instruments were taken away than we'd at least have a more subtle a clear-cut arrangement, but as it stands the album doesn't work. If Williams wants to do pop music, she needs to go all out and put more hooks within the songs. She can't have it both ways. This is certainly not a bad album and perfectly listenable, but still a dissapointment after the brilliant ""End of Summer."""
3,Acoustic Guitar takes the back seat,"I've liked Dar Williams for years, and have even seen her in concert a few times. Unfortunately, she is going the way of most popular folk singers and is ""growing"" into the pop-y, fully produced sound. If you are looking for another ""Mortal City"" or ""End of the Summer"" because you liked the sound of accoustic guitars and her voice, keep looking. Most of the tracks on this recording are much more mixed/produced and she uses a lot more synthesised sound. Oh, well. All good things must come to an end."
4,the green world,"under the masterful eye of stuart lerman (producer) and with steuart smith as co pliot, dar williams as put together a team of artist that add a colorful palate to her already incredible music and lyrics. she sings about 8 years steadying the ship of lie, sending gifts to the heavens and receiving others. she comtemplates G-d, the external forces and internal resources of each of us. she even wonders if Yoko Ono was musically superior to john lennon. she always pushed us to that place in ourselves that we are willing or unwilling to go. and dar takes us there gently. Dar williams created a warm and gentle record, that rocks pops and folks."
2,Arab Mediterranean 1900,"(From another review): Contents include: Madeira and the Azores; Gibraltar and Tangier; Granada and the Alhambra; Algiers and Malta; Constantinople Old and New; Under the new Constitution(Turkey); Cross and Crescent in Conflict(Islam vs Armenians); Smyrna and Ephesus; Beirut, Damascus and Baalbec; Higher Education in Turkey; Egypt and the Nile and much more. 256 pages with photographs & map."
5,Wonderfully Crafted,"Maria's work is a page-turner, gripping the reader with the honesty in which she relates joys, sorrows, triumphs, downfalls and everything in between. With a sense of both humor and rationality, she shares her story of a life of urban ministry. Although her book presents many harsh realities, she also presents hope. While reading her book I took time to cry, laugh and dream of a brighter future for our cities."
1,Ohio,"This item (DVD)is defective, there is no audio (Duel of the 7 Tigers). If this defect is ever made correct, the movie has some very good action scenes. I have seen an English version on VHS and look forward to seeing better quality on DVD but there was no audio. Very disappointing and there was no English dub version. The second movie is very grainy and not good quality at all. Poor product at best."
5,The Foundling Fox,this is a great book it is a must read .once you read it you will love it too. my daughter loves this book and as from the first time i read it to her. i have read that book to my daughter about 100 times and to me it's one of the best books to read to a child or children
2,Wait for the next edition.,"This particular edition of LP Cuba will do you little good in the year 2005 and it's not necessarily all LP's fault as Cuba undergoes a metamorphosis every other day or so. So, go with another guide for more up to date information on currency and prices in general as well as legal casas.And specifically for the Hotel Lido: whomever wrote up the little ditty about how only the brave should stay there does a great disservice to that hotel.Finally, it would be nice if the author could actually stop blaming the US for 2 seconds and perhaps hold Castro accountable for something other than nothing."
2,Candid Discussion - Bad on Entertainment & Hotels,"While Lonely Planet Cuba does a good job of discussing the country and its culture in an objective way, its discussion of hotels and entertainment is way off. Prices for hotels listed is correct, but reviews of the property and the surrounding area is terrible. In addition, the discussion of nightlife is ridiculously off - Cuba has very little nightlife!!!"
1,Doesn't go in depth,"I just studied in Cuba for four months, with a group of 20 other students, which gave me the opportunity to look over almost all of the Cuba guidebooks on the market. Lonely Planet was definitely the worst...if you're only going to be in Cuba for a few days, then it's fine. But if you want to really learn about the country's fascinating history and culture, don't opt for LP. I was one of two students to buy the Moon Handbook, and the other students were constantly borrowing it, because their Lonely Planet books just didn't have enough information."
1,Bad micrphone system,When I first recieved the system one of the microphones did not work at all. The other mics had a weak signal and kept fading in and out when used. I had no other choice than to return everything back to Amazon. I was very dissappointed in the quality of this item.
2,owners anual,"Hi there was no owners manual in the box with the microphone you sent to me, could you email me one or let me know where on the net I can optain one .thank you"
2,Mediocre Mics,"Do not expect too much from these mics. I noticed 3 issues: 1) digital LCD display screen stopped working within 2-3 days. It used to display the frequency for each mic, 2) wireless quality is mediocre. The antennae need to be in line of sight without any obstruction (such as a human walking by). The angle of holding mic mattered too, 3) If mic moves beyond 15 feet, you will slowly introduce noise. It builds with distance. I realize that there are not too many other wireless mic options that are affordably priced. This one will do the job, but you will wish that you had other options. I returned mine since the LCD display has stopped working."
3,"Nice, but cheap.","This is a very good setup for the money. One of the mikes picks up a local radio station but with three others working flawlessly I have no worries. I can get a range of better than 100 feet, even through steel stud walls. I have had to wrap each mike with some rubber bands to keep the battery covers on but those batteries last a good long time."
4,Lasted about a year...Now purchasing second set,"Pros: Low cost, wireless, good range (even on large stage).Cons: battery life (I have to change the batteries in each microphone every time I use them.) wires easily come loose in the top of the mircophones. (Electrical tape made a temporary fix, but now doesn't work.)I run a musical theater group for children and also teach at an elementary school. These microphones have seen quite a bit of use and I have loved them. I gave them four stars because of their durability. The only lasted about a year. I was definately hoping for more. Though, they have had much use in that year."
1,Horrible Product,"From the day it arrived, this system did NOT work. It caused a loud hum in my sound system and NONE of the 4 microphones worked. And, I bought a refurbished unit thinking that Amazon would stand by their work. By the time I got around to reporting it, the time to return it had expired. So, I spent a lot of money to get a useless product, one that was claimed by Amazon to be repaired and working -- NOT. Don't waste your money, even if Amazon claims to stand behind their repairs."
3,Pyle-Pro PDWM5500,"Very clear sound, rather you are speaking or singing. The mic's carry alot of bass, so be ready to lower yours to improve the highs. There is still blank spots when the systems looses connection during operation. What do you expect for the price. Need to work out that one operation when placing the Pyle in a mixer board. The system needs to be able to controll the mic's individually from the board not on the mic system."
4,"Good for the price, initial experience very good","better than I expected. Easy to set up. Like the antennas (easy to mount and dis-mount).Only question remaining is about reliability, and that only time will tell.I recommend this product."
1,Didn't work at all,"Got this in the mail, plugged it in for a home karaoke player (hooked up laptop to mixer, hooked up system to mixer, out speakers). System works beautifully with wired mics, so not a problem with the set up. I tried to set it up with this system and got the same issue as a previous reviewer, very loud hum, and although I could sort of hear my voice, it was pretty quiet compared to the hum. Not only that but my voice came out pretty sporadically. It seems like a defective issue, but unfortunately seems to happen more often than not.Not willing to risk it with this again, am going to try a different brand."
1,A waste of good pulp stock,"With a plot and characters so shallow you wouldn't dampen your feet if you stepped in them, Lisette Allen unsucessfully attempts to drag us into a time when apparently the most urgent and pressing activity was who was 'laving' who.The dialogue could be improved only by removal of the incredibly trite verbage and descriptions of the character's encounters with each other. Over-done reptitions of euphemisms that strive for provocative and end up ridiculous, add another nail to this horrible waste of ink and paper.The ""editor"" of this book should have his or her credentials reviewed for failing to catch any of the half dozen or so spelling errors, or any of the myraid grammatical slips.All in all, I'd rather have spent time reading a dissertation on the mating life of the average garden slug; both are about as stimulating."
4,huge medieval fan,"I'm a huge medieval fan, I just can't get enough information on the time period. So it is a treat to have an erotic book set in that time period. The details were not so horribly off, and the sex was hot. I must agree the main charachter was weak, the fiesty redhead at the begening was more interesting by far. This book adds some nice spice to my mediveal mindset though, and I just love the photograph on the cover. Is it possible to purchase these to frame???"
1,Buy Cambridge Instead,"If the 6th edition has the same LACK of clarity in its definitions as does the 5th edition, you're wasting your money. ""The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics"" by B.S.Everitt is as marvelous as the Oxford version is awful. Compare for yourself: Pick a couple of stat terms and compare the definitions in ""O"" with those in ""C."" Note: I just bought the 3rd edition of ""Cambridge,"" but it seems little different from the wonderful 2nd edition."
2,Don't buyt it.,"This is not a good tool book for the statistician. Since there are many wrong explainations of statistical terms. Furthermore, it is too wordy for a student to understand it. But I like the author includes many biographies of famous statisticians. Anyway! you can something better than this one."
4,FASCINATING,"Unlike some recent books, this is not just a rehashing of popular theories. The author uses Philo of Alexandria's rules for allegorical interpretation to study Luke's Gospel, and comes to amazing conclusions. If you're interested in Biblical history and willing to loosen your grip on fixed ideas, you'll appreciate this book."
5,Phenomenal History of the Thirteenth Century,"Runciman's writing is absolutely amazing in this volume which treats of Europe in the mid-to-late thirteenth century. I devoured this book in a matter of days, fascinated as I am with Sicilian history and culture. Runciman gives a fantastic view of the Kingdom of Sicily after the fall of ""The Kingdom in the Sun"", or the Norman Kingdom based in Palermo. From the benevolent king William the Good to the villanous Charles of Anjou, Runciman presents all of those occurances which led up to the Sicilian Vespers, or the systematic destruction of French power over the Sicilians on Easter Monday, 1282. A must-read for all those interested in the history of Europe in this era."
4,Solid scholarship,"This is a very good narrative history of events in the Mediterranean basin, primarily in the west, wrapped around the revolt of Sicily against the French garrison and administartors. Runciman's style made this a pleasure to read, and the diagrams explaining who was who in the French royal family, Aragon, Sicily, Majorca and Byzantium helped to keep the personalities straight. Runciman uses the first part of his narrative to set the stage of what happened and why during the Sicilian Vespers. The interplay between the various kingdoms with interets in the region was fully described, as well as the interaction between Manfred, Charles and the pope. Since the Vespers is only used as a focal point to drive the main discussion, Runciman turned out an excellent work on the political history of the area, and stayed away from social history, which seems to be the focus of current Medievalists. The bibliography is superb and makes this a valuable reference for further reading."
2,"Interesting topic, poorly presented","The period of history is interesting, but the writing isn't. Lots of names and dates, and it's helpful to know your Guelfs from your Ghibellines, but ultimately the book doesn't deliver. The world continues to scream for writers on Medieval topics with a gift for prose"
2,No good for certification,"Don't rely on this book for certification, concepts are hazy, not explained clearly, a lot is left out. Not bad for a guide to new features but overall I didn't like it."
3,Not what I expected,"The book doesn't cover even 70% of all 9i New Features.More over - for that 70% it's just a reference, so you can't use it neither as a help for preparing to upgrade exam nor as DBA handbook."
5,Very good book,Robert has done the Business. I am a keen member of Revealnet and I must admit I had never heard of Mr Freeman before then. I am Fully OCP in 7/8/8i and this book is exactly what I needed for my upgrade. The book covers all the new features and hits the nail on the head. A must for all DBAs (both Junior and senior). Cant wait to see his next book.
3,not for use as a study guide for ocp upgrade,the book covers a broad range of topics but is not a good ref for the ocp upgrade exam.
5,excellent,"Ms Pei manages to convey subtle, complex emotions in remarkably simple readable prose. What happened to her since writing this? I was disappointed to find Amazon lists no titles other than this."
1,This is horrible!,"I bought this for my stepdad since he really loves Harley Motercycles. When I recieved this, lo and behold, a closer look revealed that this is NOT a Harley Davidson product as the title clearly stated. No HD, no eagle, no nothing. Where the Harley Logo on the bike was supposed to be, there was a foreign language in its place. What I thought was cool buttons were actually pictures of ""Crotch Rockets"" I was told that it was new. HA! The ""red velvet"" was broken in a corner and clearly dented in some areas. I am none to pleased."
2,Somewhat odd cookbook,Odd format. Odder still section devoted to the chefs. Many great Chicago restaurants missing. Many great Chicago restaurant recipes missing. One wonders if this was more of a co-promotional venture than a true attempt at offering a survey of great Chicago eating establishments. Does not do justice to the city.
3,Colorless but informative on the basics,"Features sketches of woman fashions that are accompanied by details of fabrics used and history of the evolution of fashion of the time. Text explains the common ways woman would obtain new outfits and the rules of society of the time such as how much skin was ""too much"" skin . Also has a short section on fashion accessories, hair styles and children's clothing."
5,Very cute and to the point. Excellent rhythm.,Excellent for small children. It has a great rhythm that keeps young childrens attention. Very creative and cute.
5,Haunting Children's classic,"Along with ""A Wrinkle in Time"" this is one of the most intriguing and haunting ""childrens'"" books I've ever read.I discovered it after seeing the 1989 movie ""Paperhouse,"" which was closely based on the book. The movie, superb in its own right, interestingly inverts some of the major themes in Paperhouse, the result being that, together, they form a wonderful counterpoint to one another and are richly rewarding for anyone interested in the power of dreams, the isolation often felt by children, and the reality of the unseen world beyond our conscious senses.After seeing the movie I searched for nearly 10 years for the book, finally finding a ragged copy in a London bookstore using bibliofind.com. If you have trouble locating it, keep trying. There is a new edition published in England, so searching there will probably yield the best results."
4,School Book,This was a book that I needed for a class at school. It was good for the class I was using for.
4,Cheap! Great price!,Cheap and great price! Thank you! love this product so much. This is like what i expected. I would like to recommend this product to my friends.
4,Pretty good,"The book came in pretty worn on the outside, but the inside's perfectly fine. The book was extremely cheap. Shipping was also great. I had it in like no time."
3,College Course Pain,"The book was needed for a college course. So far, what i have learned from it, has be very informational. the only issue i've had, is that some of the information that the test asks, is sporadic. Instead of telling me everything I need to know about and certain act, you have to read two to three chapters to get all of the information."
4,Very Informative,"This book was purchased for a college course, but the more I learn, the more I think that everyone should take the time to read this book. It is very thorough and full of facts about every kind of drug: prescription drugs, alcohol, stimulants, depressants, opiates, inhalants, hallucinogens, etc.It covers the history of the drug and present use in the United States. It also covers the different ways that the drug can be administered, affects on the central nervous system and other major systems of the body and their effects on homeostatic balance. There are also chapters on drug prevention and treating dependency.Overall I think it is a great read and VERY educational."
2,Needs editing.,"This book seemed like a good source of information about drugs. However, I have started to doubt how valid the information in it is because I noticed that Wikipedia is cited in two places. Wikipedia is not a reliable enough source to be cited in a textbook! Additionally, I found that a map showing statistics on alcohol use conflicted with the information that was in the text that was discussing the same study results."
5,Drugs In Society,Book like new. Ordered and received next day. The book is used for class and timing was important. Purchased the book for less than half the college bookstore price. Thanks
4,Meeting Of Two Jazz Greats,"The idea of getting Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong together had probably been on many peoples minds, but their schedules just seemed to keep it a dream. That is until Roulette scheduled a date when both Armstrong and Ellington was in town. Some compromises had to be made, the band used was Armstrong's All Stars, and the music is all Ellington. Using the All Stars instead of Ellington's big band kept Armstrong in the small combo setting where he fits best. Ellington replaced Armstrongs normal piano player and everything worked out fine. The songs were well know to the band as several had played in Ellington's big band. This is classic jazz of the highest order. The technical quality of the disk (all in stereo) will not disappoint."
3,"Okay, but get Walking With A Ghost",I'm pretty sure the B-side is the version on Walking With A Ghost. If you already have the album and Walking With A Ghost then this is pointless to own.
2,purchased this for the first couple of minutes or so...,"I only purchased this for the little Hung gar demo at the beginning, other than that, the movies are pretty cheeeeeezy!!!"
3,"Preferable to ""Moanin'"" Session","If you're a Blakey newbie, may as well pick this up in place of his popular ""Moanin'"" session, since the first two tracks are from that date. But Blakey is as hard to represent on a single album as Ellington, Coltrane, Miles, or Sinatra. Moreover, you have to go beyond the Blue Note catalog to get the big picture. Take just some of the trumpet players in Blakey's units--Clifford Brown, Bill Hardman, Donald Byrd, Joe Gordon, Kenny Dorham, Lee Morgan, Freddy Hubbard, Valery Ponomarev, Wynton Marsalis, Terrence Blanchard. Each can be heard on individual Blakey recordings that outshine this collection. And the list of saxophonists is no less impressive (make sure you have plenty of Hank Mobley in your Blakey collection). Personally, I'd recommend ""The Jazz Messengers"" on Columbia ahead of this Blue Note sampler as a more aesthetically satisfying introduction to the group."
3,CAREFUL,"THESE ARE GOOD SPEAKERS BUT IF THEY ARE MOUNTED IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT THEY WILL NOT LAST LONG, A YEAR TOPS. JUST SAYING."
3,Not bad at all so far,"The LED lights are essentially inconsequential, but the sound is not bad for the price ($28.91). A tad tinny but acceptable sound. Not as good perhaps as the stock Infinity speakers my Dodge came with, but better than enduring blown speakers by a long shot! :)"
1,Super Small.,"I had ordered this book as a valentines gift. I was disappointed when I realized I had missed the ""miniature"" part of the description. This book is no bigger than the palm of your hand."
1,Can I at least get my item shipped before problems.,This was the worst experience ive had with ordering books not only did i not receive the book but i also never even got a confirmation of the book being sent. I sure got the one about the funds being removed though. 4.8 ughh a lot of lucky people i guess all i know is i am dissappointed and wont be back customer lost.
3,interesting book,The book was in great shape and acctually signed by the author. Thought that was a plus! Got here in a timely manner.
2,Just ok....,Somewhat disappointed with this version of the Kama Sutra. The beautiful erotic Indian artwork that I've seen included in so many other versions was very much lacking in this one.
3,Kamasutra,This book isn't what I was expecting. I was hoping for the kind with pictures. This was also a gift and I was somewhat disappointed that it wasn't what I was expecting.
1,Unsound,Wendy Doniger has joined hands with Sudhir Kakkar (who knows no Sanskrit and one wonders how he could have been of any help) and produced another unsound translation of an Indian text.
5,"Start from Part II, then it's in excellent flow","Read chapter 10 to 18 rather than from beginning, Then, this book is in very good flow - Even for beginner. If you do not have a SQL server to run the sample code, just create an Access DSN instead of."
2,"Visual Interdev 6 ""Untested""","Ok, Id expect this book to be of quality material its from sams press, I started following some of the examples hand codinging them along with the tutorials, and upon running the applications, none of them worked, they all had errors. So i pushed in the CD and ran the same examples that they provided, same errors, sometimes different errors. OK, so maybe its just my computer, PWS. Lets run it on a NT computer, nope, same errors, and even another computer, same errors. OK? whats going on?This book is more Uncool than it is Unleashed. to the authors of the book: next time make sure your demos acctually run...please pardon my poor english... ack"
2,Regular,"Un poco confuso, el orden de los temas no es el mejor, se supone debes saber algo ya sobre VI, no es el indicado si quieres partir de 0. Por otro lado tiene bastante informacion (en exceso para mi gusto)."
2,Disjointed and confusing,"I had high expectations for this book since it had a 5 star rating from the previous 7 readers which is why I ordered it. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed. Although the book does touch on many important topics, it is very disjointed and there is no kind of flow for the content. The explanations for the source code consist of ""Paste in this code and everything will work fine"" which is a far cry from explaining what is happening in the code block. You can tell that this book is the combined result of many different authors with no major flow between the chapters. I bought the book hoping for an in-depth review of Visual InterDev and what I got was a superficial review some of the features. I am sorely disappointed."
3,"Good Start, but lots of errors","This was a good book as an introduction to developing ASP with VI. I had come from a ""code everything by hand"" approach and VI unleashed has given me a great introduction to the visual developement capabilities of InterDev 6. However, the major drawbacks are Chapter 23 and 24. I learn best by doing and while the steps in creating the example online catalog helped me to learn how to use DTCs, etc in the end the examples did not work. Examples that don't work are very frustrating. I want to see the program I did in the examples work, not chase down bugs. Also adding to my frustration is that there are no online resources where fixes and updates to the text exist. All in all though, the book presented the material well and helped me get a good grasp of VI6."
5,cell food,"The order for my cellfood came quickly! It was an amazing price, lower than Ihave been paying. I will definitely reforder this item!"
5,Increase energy without caffeine!,I was looking for ways to increase my energy without caffeine. This product works really well. Gives you a constant steady flow of energy throughout the day without the crashes you get from coffee and other caffeine products. But the best thing about it is that my ability to focus and concentrate and greatly improved. Studying has been much easier and I also feel like my memory has improved. I use cell food and drink a green drink every day to keep my energy levels up.
2,No difference!,"I could not tell any difference, will not reorder. It does taste ok but is hard to ""measure"" the dose."
1,Not for us,"My husband and I saw absolutely no results from this product. I am sure it works well for some, but did not for us."
5,Regarding cellfood product order.,I would recommend this exceptional product to everyone with a health issue. Easy to order and prompt shipping.Packaging is excellent and appreciated. I will continue to tell others. Thank you.
4,Great Produce,"As senior citizens nearing our 70s, my husband, a friend, and I each noticed an immediate decrease in ""brain fog"" !"
2,Be prepared to replace,"I've had this unit for six years. I'll be replacing my fourth pump assembly this year. That's about $80.00. Also be prepared to replace the wand assembly every couple of year. This item is OK for occasional use, but don't expect it to be agricultural grade or to use it more than 5-6 times without expecting something to break."
1,SEEING STARS USED TO SIGNIFY BEING DOWN: STILL DOES,"What tape were your reviewers listening to ?This is a hodgepodge of numbers recorded in 1952,before Stan got his act together. Only ""My Lady""has merit."
5,My all-time favorite Kenton album.,"Invention for Guitar and Trumpet amazes me every time I hear it. If you've never heard this one, Maynard and Sal will blow you away. The entire album is a talent showcase with no ""space fillers""."
5,Seven year old son loves this series!,My son was not into reading before this series. He read each book eagerly and as an adult I read them too. The books are humorous and fun for children and adults. These books are best described as an adventure series which is perfect for young readers. He could not wait for me to get him each new book in the series.
2,Some annoying errors in this 2011 version.,I'm only a couple of chapters in this book and I've noticed a number of diagram and proofreading errors. Most of the positive reviews here are dated before this 2011 version so I assume the older version was fine. You'd be better off finding a used copy of that.
3,Annoying Typos,Just OK. I found multiple typos and errors in board diagrams annoying. I'm not good enough to make the errors obvious to me at first time through.
1,I don't get it???,Why is this book's publishing date listed as 2011 when some reviewers read it 15 and even 20 years ago?? Isn't this false advertizing?
4,Cheap equipment with cheap price. But works as it should easily.,"Ok I have used this unit for both my macbook with garage band and on my Windows XP machine. Both work without issue. It's plug and play with both operating systems. On my PC, I use Fruity Loops and have used this controller flawlessly. No connection problems, nothing. The keyboard itself is definitely nothing special, its a simple controller with that one function in mind. For the price, I couldn't ask for more, that's what my s80 is for. I like this because it is light and easy to transport. My s80 weighs probably well over 60-70 lbs - not an easy transport. But the heck with midi, the easy USB input is great. If you are looking for a simple controller this will do it. If you want more features look elsewhere."
4,It works great on a Mac,"I'm sorry you Windows users have had such a miserable time with getting things to work. I have an old g4 Mac powerbook with 1.1 USB and had no trouble installing. Since then, I've had a blast using an old version 2 of Garageband to create all kinds of satisfying music. The keys don't have the feel of an upscale controller but you can't expect that at this price range. Just didn't want everyone out there to think this keyboard and software is a total bust. For me, it wasn't at all."
1,Worthless,"I bought this product a while ago to use with an entry-level Sibelius program. It never worked. So, a year later, with Finale PrintMusic, and a different computer, I am trying to make this work. I've had trips to the local electronics store for various connectors, and it still does not work. I continue to get error messages about the USB being non-functional, but I have tried several USB cords. I am sorry I did not ship this back when I first got it. It is going back into the garage, and I would not even want to sell this to anyone, because, even though it lights up, I have yet to get a sound from it. My last ditch is to try contact with M-Audio, but I heard that is difficult."
1,worthless?,Can't really help in reviewing the keyboard... XP said no thanks to the software disc... What a waste of time...
1,Agree with above review,"Although M-audio claims the 49e is compliant with Windows XP, I could not install it. And tech support was no help. So much for ""plug and play."""
5,Without Peer,"I can only second the reviews here. But I would add that in addition to Iberia, Sanchez brings the same passion and great sense of rhythm to the other music. La Vega in particular has a hypnotic quality and real atmosphere. My guess is the sound in Marc-Andre Hamelin's Hyperion set is superior, but the sound for Sanchez, while metallic at times, is adequate. This set is a real discovery for me, and brings the music to life in a way de Larrocha approximates, fine though she is."
1,Trivial and Trite Timewasting Dross,"Sick and tired of audio or paper books that spend their time retelling boring stories, repeat aka read verbatim from equally dull in conclusive research articles, and give such brilliant statements such as ""every child is special"". If pediatric neurosurgeons are brilliant it doesn't show here, and sorry ignorant sops all religions are not equal.There is absolutely NOTHING of use of value here for the person interested in or the person that has someone with pediatric tumors. Make them send you $20 to painfully read through this."
5,realistic hope in the darkest moment,"IF I GET TO FIVE: WHAT CHILDREN HAVE TAUGHT ME ABOUT COURAGE AND CHARACTER is more than just a biography focusing on the great accomplishments of Dr. Fred. This nonfiction is more of a vigorous lesson that when it seems all but over in the bottom of the ninth, still swing the bat of life. Dr. Fred provides anecdotals from his mentoring tutors, the many children whose lives touched his.The book also bolsters those with disabilities to achieve more than the expectations of those around them by conquering the Pygmalion Effect. Dr. Fred overcame his own childhood handicaps and a recent one as an adult due to an accident.In many ways this is an Art Linkletter bio, but the stakes are everything worthwhile. Well written and inspirational, Fred Epstein, M.D, and Joshua Horwitz provide realistic hope in the darkest moment by encouraging adults to heed the advice of their little ones who, even when death nears, show what life is all about.Harriet Klausner"
5,WHAT A WONDERFUL TREASURE,"THE SOUNDTRACK IS ALMOST AS GOOD AS THE MOVIE, WHICH WAS A PLEASURE; THE PHOTOGRAPHY, SETTINGS, ACTING WERE SUPERB; BUY IT, YOU'LL WANT TO WATCH IT OVER AND OVER"
2,NOT a good choice for family viewing,"While many reviewers here have given the film high praise, many parents or teachers will be unprepared on the basis of those reviews for some of the more sordid elements of the film. Unless you want to explain to your children, for example, why, when the mother pulls back the sheets, she finds her daughter's pants are wet (after an encounter with her boyfriend), this film would not be a good choice for family viewing.The film's premise, to show the impact of the war on everyday life at home, is excellent, but some viewers will not be able to stomach the coarse elements that are an integral part of the film.For a thoughtful, and often inspiring, look at British homelife during the war years for junior high and up I recommend the novel Enemy Brothers by British author Constance Savery, a skilled storyteller who lived through the period."
2,"Wow, not what I remembered","Last time I watched this film was in the theaters (I was probably 11) and I remember seeing it like 3 times I loved it so much. I remembered a great, heartwarming, joyful, funny film. Oh how my memory let me down.What I got was a disjointed movie - really just a bunch of scenes strung together - with too few laughs and too little heart. Sure my Girlfriend says in the last 20 minutes it really improved and you really felt for the characters (I had gone to bed by then). But honestly I spent the first hour of the movie in embarrassment that I had talked it up so much.Oh well, another childhood memory shattered ;)I would never watch it again nor suggest it to anyone."
1,Yuck!!!!!!!!!,This movie was absolutely awful. I love war movies and foreign movies and so forth but movie was terrible. My husband hated it too. I can't figure out how in the world anyone would like it. It is totally goofy.
1,Greatly Disappointed,I bought this movie based on the ratings and reviews of other Amazon viewers thinking it would be good to use in my middle school classroom. Boy was I disappointed. It was filled with sexual content and innuendo and my wife and I turned it off before it ended whilst previewing it for the class. It don't believe it to be family viewing.
1,Oh....Oh....OHHHHH Fudge!!,"Mortifying. I can't even put into words how annoyingly bad this film was. I'd rather be forced to drink 10 week old fryolator grease from a seafood restaurant than have to watch this film again. It's the equivilant of having your genitals smashed repeatedly with a toffee hammer.I've had cold sores that I've been happier with than this drivel. Please, life is too precious to waste it on this. I plead with you...it would be better if you gave yourself an enema with a garden hose than view this film.Nuff said..."
3,British born,"British born blokes, like my ex-wife who experienced the Blitz, say this movie is just like it was. I wasn't there but can still feel and envy the era as I might have been."
5,What can you say about a movie,"One of my favorate. Take my review as written, or not, your choice. Why, Why, Why, Why, Why Why, Why."
4,need to exchange,Did not know DVD was the UK version. Cannot play on USA DVD player. It was a gift. Very disappointed.
4,Hope & Glory is one of the best WWII movies ever.,I first saw H & G years ago and immediately fell in love. It hasn't the gore so common in war flicks but it tells the story of one English family during the Blitz with compassion humor and a strong sense of truth. If you like the personal stories of life during wartime (and you're a fan of English humor) you'll love this movie. Buy it. . . it's a movie you'll want to watch more than once.
5,Drench your being with HOPE and GLORY,"I watched this film, so sneaky, as it took me through the eyes of a young boy who matures within WWII. I laughed, bit-nails, cried, held-on, and laughed so much more. This is a great movie. Do yourself a favor. See it!"
4,Winning The War Means Having a Plan,"Talent is now a critical driver of corporate performance;a company's ability to attract, develop and retaintalent has not ceased to be important in the current sloweconomy. Managerial talent, in particular, is at the epicenterof the war for talent -- people with the ability tolead a company or division, guide a production team, orsupervise a group of workers are the elements that differentiategreat companies from merely good ones."
3,Good talent also requires good systems,"Based on quantitative surveys, this study identifies that few US companies are good at recruiting, retaining and developing talented people and that excellent performance produces qualitatively and quantitatively superior results. The key cause of success is a mindset among leaders that gives high priority to excellence across all aspects of building talent. The advice provided for achieving excellence with talented individuals is well set out and, not surprisingly, mostly obvious. What needs explanation is why so few leaders give real attention to their stock of talent. The book also tends to assume that talented individuals produce good results, with out looking at the system within which they work."
3,"Useful, but ... a certain energy company?","This book has many interesting things to say - although the selection of case studies is somewhat unfortunate. A cynic might say that by following the suggestions of this book, your company can be as successful as ... Enron. I, of course, am not that cynical."
3,Not a movie,"It you are interested in this item, be aware that it is not a movie DVD. I bought it expecting to see a concert performance of the music. Instead, all you get on the screen whilst the music plays is a static caption telling you what you are listening to. The sound quality is excellent. The performance is OK but not as good as some others you can buy on CD."
3,"Not bad, but not great.","It's nice to have a film about my favorite composer. I felt that the movie moved in different directions, beginning story threads that were never resolved. I also felt, as much as I adore Sibelius's music, that his music was often played in the background in places where it didn't fit. This isn't the best directed film ever, but it was enjoyable nonetheless. I would only recommend this film to devoted fans of Sibelius such as myself. I plan on reading a book about Jean Sibelius in the near future to see how much of this film is true and to learn more about this fantastic composer. If you plan on getting this DVD, just be sure it will play on your player. I have a multi-region player so it'll play just about any DVD."
1,"WOW, a ""cd player"" that doesn't play cds!!!","First off, I'm not under 13, I just forgot my password. Well, I when I got this cd player, I put my Against All Authority cd in it (also brand new[by the way great cd!]), it started clicking and the cd didn't play. Of course, the cd was perfectly normal, and played great in my five year old memorex player, but this player is horrible quality. I took it back to BestBuy and thankfully they let me exchange it for a Sony Psyc, which for about $10 more is worth it. Please don't make the same mistake as me in buying this player, there IS a reason it is clearancing out. I would be sooo pissed if i burnt 60 bucks on this and they didn't exchange it. Well, on the positive side, I hear it does have about a 50 hour battery life...but then again if it doesn't play cds there is really no point. Bottom line: DONT BUY!"
1,waste of money,"the mp3 player chokes on 160 kbs lame encoded mp3 filesthe random play function doesn't work (seems to play only a small subset of the tracks on a disc, and repeats the same track several times)"
3,relatively good for that price,I bought it last week but I am a little bit disappoinnted. Why:1. the sound is pretty flat. The XBS is powerful but the rest is like a background. No equalizer is available so nothing can help.2. the behind the neck headphones are horrible. They do not fit to your ears so you do not hear the music if you are outside or not in a quiet room. Tehy also slip and I have the feeling they are made for big headed people with big enough ears like Shrek for example.3. Without a remote control you will find it dificult to operate because you have to take it out everytime you want to adjust the volume or skip forward. The buttons are small and almost the same so there is no way to adjust it without taking it out of your pocket.4. The radio is good even though you cannot listen to it were there is no coverage.Overall it is good if you are not a sound quality maniac like me. I have a cheaper RCA which sounds better. Changing the headphones won't help either.
3,Mp3 functionality - pros & cons,"I bought this mainly for use in listening to long (45 minutes to 1 hour) mp3 audio files that I have burned to CD of sermons, lectures, and audio books. One very good feature this has is, when the unit is stopped and powered off, and then powered back up for the next use, it will start at the exact minute and second where it was previously stopped. This is very nice when you are 38 minutes and 21 seconds into a 55 minute mp3 file. The downside is, this player is not capable of searching through mp3 files. So, if you do not press ""stop"" prior to powering the unit off, it will not register where you were within the mp3 file when stopped. In the case of this unit, you then have no way of getting back to the 38 minute spot within that file, besides listening through to that point again. I had to return my unit because of the lack of this feature. Other than that, it is a very nice item."
1,Don't buy this Unit,"Compared to the Sony CD/MP3 player that i used to have, this Panasonic is awful.- very cheap feel to the unit as a whole. the hinged cover is especially low grade. feels like it is held onto the rest of the unit by a thread.- sounds ok, as long as you use other headphones. the ones provided lack clarity and punch. moreover, they fall off very easily- most of the controls on this unit sit in a row along the edge. the buttons are all of the same shape, and in low light, it's difficult to tell the various push buttons from one another. (volume up, volume down, track up, track down, play, stop)."
4,"This is some of the best, but a good intro, nonetheless.","Bud Powell was a genius - and there is a flip side to that. Bud had to deal with that flip side sporadically up through the mid-1950s, when it got the best of him. These Blue Note tracks give a glimpse into the genius that dwelled within this man. No, not every track is a ""best"", but enough of the musicality is here to warrant a 4 star rating. A prolific composer as well, most of the tunes here are penned by Powell. This is a good introduction to the genius that was Bud Powell, even if not every single cut is up to the high bar that this great set early on."
3,"Oh, It's Okay...","Johnson's essays are often funny, if wildly uneven. He steals styles (and sometimes jokes!) from Al Franken, Bill Maher, Dennis Miller, Dave Barry, to name a few. Unfortunately, he's not as funny as any of those writers, but he does make me chuckle from time to time. He's definitely on the pitbull side of liberalism (doesn't shy away from jokes about those drunken Bush daughters, for example). Although mostly about Bush, there are essays of varying topics (a lot of the early ones deal a lot with then-Gov. Jesse Ventura). As with all essay collections, I suppose, some are funnier than others and are better in part than in whole. But some lines bring it home for me: ""The Pope says clones won't have a human soul, so what happens if we clone James Brown? Will he wear turtlenecks and belt out You Light Up My Life?"" Funny. Wish there were a lot more lines like that, but that's funny."
5,perfect base,"this is the best base layer you can buy, period. wicks better than anything I've every tried, plus was perfectly warm. I need to buy one in a short sleeve"
5,Fans of Monster Jam,"I bought this for my son who is a great monster jam fan. We were excited to receive this in the mail in great packaging. I purchased frames to hang it up in his room and it is a great decoration for his room,"
3,Interviews drag down the action,Bought this for my 3 yr old who constantly asks to watch monster truck crashes and freestyle on you tube. He lost interest during the interviews - which seemed to go on forever..
4,"Monster trucks... ccol, but....uhh...","We got this for our kids, and they love it. They watch it practically every day. for me, it's not horribly interesting after a few minutes, just quick clips of various tricks by bunches of different trucks, and ""interviews"" with a bunch of the drivers that really just remind me of old school WWF wrestling, back when Hulk Hogan was still at it. Great for preschoolers, but it has put me to sleep, after the 37 millionth time I watched it with the boys."
1,"Shame on you, Bamert!","I have waited so long for a modern digital recording of Richter's Sinfonia con fuga in g minor (here no.29), and what do we get? A first movement which is cut in half!In actuality, the 1st movement is Adagio - Fuga - Adagio - Fuga da capo. So what is this movement as performed by Bamert? Adagio - Fuga. That is it! The lovely adagio section which follows the first fuga is omitted along with the da capo of the fuga. The fuga is so masterful that it is worth hearing twice, and that is how Richter composed it!Too bad the archive LP of this lovely symphony along with other sinfonias from composers of the Mannheim School has not be reissued on CD.I will not comment one way or another on the other four sinfonias on this disc since I am not familiar with them. But I cannot recommend this CD due to the incompleteness of the symphony no.29 in g minor."
2,Pastor Review,Not particularly valuable for learning how to evaluate the performance of a pastor of a church.
4,A light and witty crime novel,"This is the eighth book in a series about Jesse Stone, the Chief of Police in the small town of Paradise, Massachusetts. I have not read any of the other books in the series but that didn't impact on my enjoyment of the novel. I'm not sure how to categories it - technically I suppose it's a crime novel, but of the three central (and interlinked) cases only one is actually a crime and it's a pretty small scale one at that. Jesse is dealing with a voyeur on the loose and a school principal who is violating her female pupils' rights by inspecting their underwear. Jesse is also grappling with the breakdown of his marriage.The novel is very dialogue driven and it hums along with a wry sense of humor. It's a quick read, similar in writing style to Neil Cross but with less violence and more wit. Jesse is a terrific character but so are the rest of his team. It also reminded me of Steve Hamilton's series about a detective in Paradise, Michigan."
3,"Easy to read, hard to review","Let's face facts -- this is not a great book. The central mystery is pretty toothless, and there are a pair of subplots (one involving a principal and another the ever-lovin' Jenn) that don't have much bite either. Even the good guys are universally, sniggeringly sex-obsessed -- Jesse can't seem to have a conversation with Molly that doesn't include a reference to her one-night stand -- which makes their investigating sex crimes a bit disturbing. And Jesse does a thing or two in the line of police work that cannot be legal.On the other hand, Parker is suddenly gone. Which means that our times with Jesse, Suit, Molly and Sunny and Spike (who visit from one of Parker's other series) is now suddenly limited. So I found myself savoring the denizens of Paradise more than I would have under other circumstances.It's below average Parker, but below average Parker is better than no Parker at all. And that makes me sad."
2,"Who said, he said, she said.","MY first exposure to Jesse Stone, Paradise, and R.B. Parker. I enjoyed the persona of the police force, particulaarly Jesse's laid back style and commitment to virtueously serving and protecting. Story line, as discussed by other reviewers was mildly engaging. Ending quite predictable as was most of the story. As an audio book while driving, the ""he said,"" ""she said"" abysmal dialog was beyond annoying. If not for favorable reviews by ardent fans, I would have put Parker and Jesse in the ""to be avoided"" category. They may be worth another try, but with the comments about Jenn I am not sure."
2,Not that good,"Expected much more from this author. I Have really enjoyed his other books. This one not so much ,short empty."
3,Mr. Parker is truely missed.,"I have always enjoyed the works of Robert Parker and when he passed I thought that was the end of that. The attempt to pick up the torch and carry on in the tradition was admirable, but there is only one Robert B. Parker."
3,It's an Okay read,"but still, parker undoubtedly drank more and more like jesse stone. i just wish that parker would not end up like lawrence sanders who later became an AA member and also made all of his main characters all qulified AA members. besides main characters' heavy drinking problems, parker also played with lot of words as a incurable hobby (or disease?), spenser, hawk, jesse stone, molly, suit, virgil cole, Everett Hitch, they all played with lot of words. it's just like some priests play the so-called 'god words' in front of their churches, you just want to drive by, trying very hard not to read those crappy words from god (obviously god has nothing to do with it but the priests)."
4,Weak storyline but the subplot works well,"The late, great Robert B. Parker was one of my favorite writers. His most recent books were hit-and-miss but usually enjoyable. This one is no exception. It's a fairly mediocre main plot with only the snappy dialog of Parker's characters holding it together. But the subplot of Jesse's ex-wife is woven into this book much more cohesively than usual. The book is about obsession and control. The Peeping Tom's obsession with watching and controlling his victims. Jesse's obssession with his ex-wife and her control over him. In the end, there is resolution on both levels.Parker fans, like me, will enjoy this book. Those just looking for a thrilling ride will not."
3,Night And Day,"Unfortunately, after many excellentJesse Stone books by Parker, this oneis 80% a rehash of neurotic problemswith former lovers, A disappointment"
2,Night and Day,"I was very disappointed in this book. The plot was thin, action almost nonexistent--not much to it. Definitely not your typical, entertaining Robert B. Parker book."
2,"""At least looks like Jenn is GONE!""","I usually rate Parker books higher than the average. This time I'm on the low side. I was undecided between 2 and 3 stars. But decided on 2.Of the reviews that I read I think Jeanne's review is closest to mine. I think it is Parker's worst effort of either the Sunny Randall or Jesse Stone series. The two main story lines are a panty inspection of 13 year old girls by a Middle school principal and a peeping Tom/Home invader, with a swingers club as a spinoff from the panty inspection. NONE of the stories evoked any interest from me. The major plus of ""Night and Day"" is it looks like Jesse is finally going to be rid of Jenn."
3,Night and Day,"Always hats off to Parker's story telling power. This time trivial underwear checking affair by principal develops into rather big incident for the cop of small town. Every characters in this story seem to be struggling for real love. I haven't seen the word swingers for a long time. I thought the word was a parting gift of flower generation in seventies. I never imagined those people are still existing. I'm so glad to read Jesse finally shut down Jenn who pleas coming back to him. As Japanese I have been impatient of Jesse's attitude toward her so far. I hope it will be a good start for Jesse Stone novel, not ""be bodes well!"""
2,Romance,"While many women romance authors have moved to the mystery thriller genre, this appears the first shift I'm aware of where a man who is great in the mystery thriller area shifts to romance novels. Come on Parker. Dump those feelings and add some crashes and murder. You're a guy!!."
5,Night and Day (Jesse Stone),"I love these books and the characters. Since I've followed the television series, The characters come alive to me on the pages of the books. Also, the mystery that this author always describes so well is very enjoyable."
5,Night and Day Jesse Stone Mystery,"Night and Day Jesse Stone Mystery by Robert B. ParkerLewd conduct by the junior high school principal. Others have stated she's looking at the girls underwear. Her husband is the town's lawyer and she knows she's protected.And the peeping tom now goes into houses and at gun point takes pictures of nude women.One of the girls wants the police chief to stop her parents from being swingers.Love how the investigations go with all the things going on at one time.What a town, Paradise, MA."
5,One of the greatest books I've read,"Woolf portrays the fascinations of self-discovery through relationships with other people, and she also looks into the intricacies of love--are we aware of love? What is the importance of love in a person's life? Does one need it to be happy? Taking a peek into the answers of these questions along with adding delightful humor that made me laugh out loud made this book terrific. The characters are interesting and you can choose for yourself whether or not you like them. I would definitely recommend this book--its many levels are enjoyable for all ages and both sexes!"
2,Not up to my expectations - MOVE ON JESSE,"A disappointing read. I've enjoyed the Jesse Stone series but this story didn't keep my interest. The story lacked a serious threat for Jesse to deal with. The bad guy just wasn't very bad and I really didn't care if he was caught as much as I wanted the book to end.I think it is time for Parker to let Jesse stop obsessing about Jen. If Jesse isn't bored to death with their relationship, I sure am. She wasn't that interesting to begin with."
1,MANY REVIEWS HERE ARE NOT FOR VIRGINIA WOOLF'S NOVEL!,"I clicked on 1, 2, and 3-star reader reviews for Night and Day, and it took a while to reaize that those reviews are NOT for Virginia Woolf's book, but for Robert Parker's book of the same title. I'm bringing this to readers' and Amazons' attention in case anyone else was confused. I don't know if any Woolf reviews appear under Parker's book, but somehow I doubt it! Haven't read Woolf yet, but something I'd likt to get to on my reading agenda."
1,What Climax?,"I love the Jesse Stone character in the movie as Tom Selleck does a great job. This book was written by an accomlished author. I thought the plot was shallow but the characters rich. The story got solved in the middle of the book and there was no suspense whatsoever, no sub plot and not an ounce of drama. This was a poorly crafted book and a lazy effort by Parker. It was a waste of good scenes and rich characters on ....nothingness.Perhaps he should consult Selleck for some new ideas because this was a waste of time and money.It read like something slapped together over a long weekend to satisfy an editors desire to meet a deadline."
1,Night and Day,"I'll never pay more than 9.99 for any top seller, much less Parker. I enjoy both the Stone and Spenser novels, but, really, they are so short it's almost like they should be considered short stories instead of novels. Ed P., Nashville"
5,Night and Day (Jesse Stone)- Robert B. Parker,"--I love These series of books by Robert B Parker. Even bought the DVDs to go with them. The language is a bit abrupt and I don't care for the ""F' word either. so be aware of theat. Fulll of suspense and intrigue. keeps me glued to the book until I finish reading it."
4,Parker strikes gold with Night and Day,"If you are looking for a long detailed Police Procedural look elsewhere. But if you are looking for a fun, quick read that will keep the pages turning and keep you guessing, Night and Day is for you.Featuring Jesse Stone, my favorite Parker Character, and set in Paradise, MA, this story is a great read. This time Stone is casing a peeking-tom around who seems like he might be escalating his activities, as well as finding out more and more about himself and his self-destructive behavior and relationships.This book was a very quick read, 3 hours, and even if it was quick, it was really good entertainment. I'm looking for fun when I read, not War an Peace. Parker might spit out more books each year than anyone, but boy some of them are real winners. I'm only giving 4 stars because I wanted more!!!"
3,Parker is great and Jesse is better than ever.,"It's not War and Peace, but so what. A fun read and good to know that Jesse is still in control."
1,Ugh,"I have never read this author before and thought I would give him a try. This had to be the most pedestrian piece of literary work I have ever seen. Predictable,judgemental and boring. I read the whole thing waiting for something to happen that might add a twist or some plot interest to the story. It never happened. This wasnt even worth the kindle price.At least it is good for the planet that the paperback version I would have purchased wont end up in a landfill."
3,kindle padded length,i am tired of short books padded with extra lines to make the kindle version seem longer. this book is a prime example of padding with many pages containg 10 or fewer lines.
4,Lose the Jenn Character,"I actually prefer his Spencer novels, but Jesse Stone is second to Spencer. Jesse's ex-wife, Jenn, gets on my last nerve. She's a user, and only calls him when she needs something. He's a tough cookie and I do not understand why he does not let her go. He needs to practice ""tough love."" His deputies, Molly and Suit, are hysterical and both deputies fit Jesse Stone like a glove. I just wish Jesse would talk a little more. Good thing the story carries itself."
4,Jesse Stone does it again!,"How can anyone not enjoy Jesse, Suit & Molly - every book is a delight. Love Jesse's humor and outlook on life - drinker or not!"
5,Simply the best,"This is just one of several CDs by Claude Delangle that prove he is unmatched as a classical saxophonist--period. Dating back to his monumental recording, The Solitary Saxophone, also on BIS, he has clearly established himself as the musical ambassador for the saxophone and has garnered the respect of musicians worldwide. Noone can match his refinement and control, nor his uncanny sense of intonation and technique. He is the master of the instrument and few recordings can hold up to his artistry. This recording including rarely recorded pieces of the Schmitt and Caplet, is highlighted by simply stellar playing on the Ravel transcription. He should be an inspiration to all saxophonists regardless of any 'school of thought.'"
5,Great CD Purchased Through Amazon,I love big band music. It reminds me of my childhood when we moved to Detroit Michigan after World War II.
3,Fun but not very functional,"My son received this toy for his 6th birthday. He absolutely loves it. It's durable (he tends to just throw his toys on the floor when he finds something else to play with). The biggest problem we've found with it is that it says it has a range of 50 or 100 feet, and it doesn't. You can't hear someone talking through it 20 feet away. My son constantly wants me to play with it with him, and he stands in his room screaming at me and I can't hear him through the toy. But, he loves it anyway, and overall he has alot of fun with it."
1,Did not work,"We received these as a birthday gift and they only worked if you were in the same room, and even then the reception had alot of static. I am very disappointed in these."
1,The fighting is terrible. The acting is laughable. The dialogue,The fighting is terrible. The acting is laughable. The dialogue is clumsy.It's a complete waste of money.This is one of the worst movies of Donnie Yen.
2,Not as good as expected from Weller,"It has the same problem all piezo lighters have, the striker goes out after a short time. I suppose if you used it once a month it would last a long time, I use mine many times a day."
1,not what expected,showed a blue 1 got a red 1 works and everything and timely shipping but if i'd knew it was red i wouldn't of bought it
1,don't buy this torch,"I purchased one of this weller ml100 magna-lite micro torch and when it arrived, i didn't test it inmediatly because in that moment i don't needed it. But whe i needed, i filled this with butane fuel and surprise! it never work!!! The ingnition make the spark but don't turn on the flame although adjusted the flame control. I feel cheated..."
5,"Small, practical and good quality Micro Torch","I bougth this Micro torch to ""resolder"" computer boards. It works perfectly. Another good use: I was in need to prepare creme brulle for my dinner desert. It was also perfect, a thin coat of shugar and the Micro torch did a professional caramel job."
1,A low-class job,"Much as I admire the subject, I simply can't read through the book. The prose is lousy, sometimes resembling the breathless (and brainless) outpourings of those photo-romances so popular in postwar Italy, and the illustrations are of very low quality, almost as if done on a cheap photocopier. Callas would have hated this book."
2,Not worth the money,"These sheets look great at first, however they are so thin that in 6 months time the fitted sheet had pilled and worn threadbare in the leg area. I had only used delicate laundry soap and the handwash cycle, and air dry so it should have lasted much longer for the price. Next time I am buying a 19 momme silk sheet set and even if they cost double, they will be worth it since they will last for years. I should have realized the 15 or 16 momme was only for womens dresses....not thick enough for a sheet set. My advice? Do your homework before buying silk, and DON'T get the sandwashed, either, those wear out even FASTER!"
1,Wore out way too soon!,These silk sheets were given to me as a Gift. I really liked them at first and used the special detergent and the like. We followed all the laundering suggestions--which BTW are a pain. Nevertheless they kept splitting at all the seams. I had them taken to a tailor twice before they just started ripping to shreds. Such a waste of money! Buy good Egyptian Cotton linens and you'll be much happier. This is just more Chinese junk that you shouldn't buy.
2,Disappointing,"After reading the editorial reviews and other readers reviews, I was expecting an intense storyline with a heartwarming ending. Instead, what I got was a story that took way too long to get to the point of the story and mediocre writing. The first few chapters jumped from person to person and started getting a bit confusing. The ending was sappy and everything in between was just o.k. Hopefully his next book will be a lot better."
4,Friends Until the End,"Daughter By Spirit is certainly the perfect title for a story about love and friendship until the end.I'm sure most of us would love to have a friend like Christian.While Maiya could not have the kind of love she wanted with Christian she had something better an undying love and friendship.Daughter by Spirit was an interesting story one that I enjoyed reading but I will have to admit it was not all that I'd hoped for . A good story on love and friendship.I still can't imagine Maiya not going on with her life and finding the love of her life after some seventeen years.I thought if Tanya could move on Maiya certainly could or should have.The story did not really affect me the way some of the reviewers mentioned . All in All I'll give this one 3.8 *Certainly more than 3 but a little less than 4* .A story I enjoyed reading with the ending over before I knew it. An ending where I thought, is that the end?"
5,Visionary Leadership Skills,"Dilts gives you creative and powerful tools for management. He takes you through the steps of becoming a visionary leader. From an idea or dream to engaging others in helping you create a vital organization, this book shows you the way. In addition to giving you the big picture for managing people; the book has assessment tools and exercises to improve leadership skills. I found it well written with easy to apply principles."
5,"So good, and cancelled of course.","Another amazing, funny and smart show that got cancelled way before its time. Add it to the list with Freaks and Geeks, Arrested Development and every other show I've ever liked. At least Community is still going."
5,Party Down is the best show ever,"Party Down is a loveable comedy complete with characters you wish you were friends with, cringe-worthy scenerios and hilarious plots. This show is right up there with Arrested Development as the best TV comedy ever made. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out."
2,"Beware, cheesy synths and flutes","After reading all the glowing reviews I bought this without actually listening to any of it first. If you are into John Fahey and other guitarists of that kind you will be disappointed. A lot of this borders on elevator muzak, and even fans of new agers like William Ackerman will probably be turned off by the production and choice of instrumentation. He almost goes somewhere cool when he starts off ""Amazing Grace"" with a kind of ""Fripp"" approach but quits that approach very quickly. Got to say, very boring, and I like a lot of ""boring"" music."
4,Master & the Musician,"I've followed Phil Keaggy's work for many years, and I've found him to be true to his personal musical inclinations. He is an excellent musician, but he is much different from Joe Satriani and the secular's best. The Lord's Life is in the heart of his music that can't be percieved by those who write songs for the buying public instead of in the Lord."

3,Only A Notch Better Than Mezza-Mezza,"Honor Bound doesn't quite match it's grandiose thematic reach, but it does keep one's attention. It's ending hollwed me out, but it could be as much due to my not wanting it conclude the way it did as not believing it ever could end the way it did. Certainly threw me. I'd say Ratti stopped the story rather than finished it. Good characters, timely plot ... mushy and murky at times, yet has a way of shaking that off and out. Deserves credit for a Middle Eastern co-protagonist and socio-political foresight. Minus points for slowing down when it needs to speed up. A better book than most of its ilk."
3,Pretty Good,"I think Honor Bound is a courageous novel. The things John Ratti proposes in this book he takes all the way - all the way to conclusions difficult for this reader to absorb. What's startling about the story, written pre-9/11, is how much it resonates in terms of the world we now find ourself living in. There are things in this novel for both the right and left to like, and to simmer over. That's good! - And rare for a work (that may be mischaracterized) as military fiction. Usually novels in that genre beat the drum one way or another (usually on the right). Ratti may stop the plot a liitle too much, at some points it may strike you a slightly cluttered, but make no mistake, it will take you to and leave you at a place you won't see coming."
1,Bleak - Blah!,"I'm not a fan of this book. I've tried to figure out if it's because it hits too close to home of if it's due to the author's relentlessly politically pessimistic view about our present and future. Either way, it soured me. I kept hoping Ratti would pull off something uplifting by the story's conclusion, but intead he left it for the reader to decide. Too bad: Honor Bound has a good plot and exciting heroine, but she, and the reader, deserved better."
4,Overall ... Quite Good,"As a long time fan of military fiction, I was rather surprised by Honor Bound. I found it so unlike anything else in the genre that the author should be commended for his different spin on the subject matter. It's clever, what Ratti has done, creating an American military hero who is a woman, someone who is inwardly rather than outwardly a super-hero, and who has to fight the good fight against those in and out of our government. Honor Bound is an uncompromising look at the effects on those who live for honor, without the inevitable triumph we come to expect from an American military fiction protagonist. This book stayed with me long after I read it, probably because of its real world vision, something we see far too little of in books of this type."
4,Hauntingly Topical,"I read Honor Bound a few years ago and decided to post this review because this book keeps coming back again and again to me via real things that are going on in the world, most recently, about gas prices (the book has some stunning things to say about the future of fossil fules and the politics of oil). Before that, Honor Bound was also right on the mark, actually mentioning bin Laden (before 9/11) in the context of fictional terrorism ... portraying an incident similar to what happened at Abu Grahib (only with the parties reversed. I could go on, but instead I'll urge everyone to read this book. Besides being so right on the mark about current events, it's a good story to boot."
4,Alternate History or Future Prophecy?,Honr Bound is a great read! Excellent plot mixed with fascinating stipulations about where the world is heading. Not for those who never pick up a newspaper.
4,Lawrence of Arabia ... meets No Way Out,"I liked this book more than I was prepared to; as a matter of fact I can't get it out my head. Part political thriller, part military fiction, Honor Bound, at its core is all sad heart. Despite its violence and disillusionment, the author holds you close through his leading character, Kasey Lawrence, a captain in the U.S. Army who makes a choice for honor few others would. I think what Ratti has to say through Captain Lawrence's travails should be experienced by every American in these important times."
2,Not My Cup Of Tea,"I do give Honor Bound's author John Ratti points for skilfully plotting his story and for not being in love with excessive prosody (refreshing in modern fiction), but I feel the tale had a bit too much clinical precision in its exection at the cost of some of its soul. Ratti's reach was more than a little beyond his grasp in the creation and journey of his hero, army Captain Kasey Lawrence. Good try ... and I was ready to give the book three stars, but the ending let me down. I wanted more, especially since the author has said there will be no sequel."
2,"Fair, but not great","This is a rather trivial story about a woman living outside of Omaha in the late 1800s. She doesn't like the town much, but she does like the woman who runs the restaurant, despite the fact that she has a good woman back on the homestead. The progression of the story is rather mundane. Even the ""mystery"" of who stole the bell isn't much of a mystery by the end of the book. Some of the dialogue is supposed to reflect the frontier life of the people, but the only down home phrase missing was Aw, shucks. What we need is a library that specializes in loaning out women's novels, so that something like this can be read without having to pay for it."
4,Well rounded originality,"This underrated (2 reviews?) calibrated gem has in fact aged like a fine wine, that rare jazz release whose production transcends placement, allowing the guitar genius to shine in his own right while maintaining fascinating interplay with this great quartet."
1,This is NOT Reformed Covenant Theology,"Shepherd departs from the Reformed tradition when he insists that covenant keeping, i.e., faithful evangelical obedience, is necessary for justification. He de-emphasizes classical Reformed teaching, such as eternal and unconditional election, justification by faith alone (apart from any of the works of faith), and the centrality cross of Jesus Christ in the life and consciousness of the believer. Read this book if you want to explore an innovative and ""Arminianish"" theology of salvation, but turn elsewhere if you want to understand the classical Reformation view.For a solid and orthodox articulation of classical Reformed Covenant Theology, I recommend Louis Berkhof's _Systematic Theology_, and for a more thorough treatment, Herman Witsius' _The Economy of the Covenants between God and Man_."
3,An O.K. book,"This book makes a couple of good points...........but that is all this book has. The authors repeat themselves time and again. A book that is 149 pages could easily be 30. Although it is funny,I would say it is worth around.... [$]"
5,Great product,"I ordered this product for an extra long, extra orange, extra intertwisted extension cord that my husband bought. This extension cord drove me nuts! This product has kept the extension cord wrapped neatly. I also appreciate that this product allows us to use and move the cord around without it becoming a snake-like, tangled mess!"
3,Not much light,"This is a standard flashlight from 1970's technology. It doesn't throw off as much light as a Mag, but the batteries last longer. I keep it in my truck for roadside breakdowns."
5,Chesterton on Catholicism...,"Many people don't realize that Chesterton wrote his most famous work, _Orthodoxy_ *long* before he had officially converted to Catholicism. _Orthodoxy_ was published in 1908, and Chesterton was received into the Catholic Church in 1922.If _Orthodoxy_ was written as a defense of Christian sanity against the heresies of the modern world that were driving men mad, the works contain in this volume are Chesterton's defense of the Catholic Church as the bastion of that Christian sanity.This volume would be worth the purchase just for the short essay, ""What Do They Think?"" -- or even for the reminder that ""Christianity is not a religion; it is a Church."" I *highly* recommend this book."
5,The Best Collection of Chesterton's Catholic Apologetics,"Well worth the price to have ,The Catholic Church & Conversion,The Well And the Shallows & The Thing: Why I am a Catholic,all in one volume. Chesterton's writings on the Catholic faith was one of the reasons I came back to the Church.With common sense,humour & erudition Chesterton will convince you of the Truth of the Catholic Faith. Chesterton like all prophetic writers speaks to our time as much as his own."
5,Excellent Guide To Gang Activity In The Nation's Capital,"I think this book would be an excellent learning companion for teachers, administrators, police officers and anyone that has to deal with the on going gang problem in the District of Columbia. If you're looking for a novel style approach to the subject this books isn't for you. However, if you want a concise and to the point guide to gang activity and it's culture in the District then look no further. I'm looking forward to seeing another installment from the author."
2,Wasn't what I had expected,"I had heard this book discussed on a local radio show and thought it sounded interesting. I was pretty dissapointed when it arrived -- it was a thin book, written more like a handbook or a 'Gangs for Dummies'. Lots of bulleted lists -- what to look for to recognize a gang member, the names of DC gangs, etc. I was expecting something written in more of a narrative format. I suppose the information presented is still interesting, I guess I was just expecting more."
4,Fuel door,"Prompt delivery, product looks great, highly polished look like chrome, didn't give 5 star's hard to install, difficult to screw rear nuts, need better instructions. Other than that great product would buy again."
5,Great Sketchers,My son loves these Sketchers. They're perfect because they can be a little dressy or a little casual. For sneakers...this is a nice option.
4,"Looks great, but breaks easily","As with all Burberry items, this product is stylish, useful, and simply great. The amount of pockets for credit cards are just right, and the size is just perfect. However, don't try to put things in every pocket as the corners of the pockets will rip after inserting more than half the wallet capacity. Some of my friends with the same product have reported similar problems."
2,out of date article,"This article is so short that it served no purpose, really, for me to buy it. There is a reason no one else has commented on it in so many years -- by now, author has published many times on same theme. Her comments about three topics--importation of books to England from the Continent, and others--seem about what you now find on Wikipedia.JSTOR at many universities may have the original article; mine did not so I paid the $5.95 out of curiosity.For current information and an overview of the topic of books in society and cultural transformation, search for contemporary sources and comments first. Eisenstein appears to be the authority of the subject and has more recent books, articles, so forth."
3,Ultimate background............... But not very Chet,"I bought this hoping to find the same intensity present in his horn music.....not so much. Not that is isn't very pleasant..... it is! Relaxing and lowenergy....and that's the problem: low energy. He had a sweet voice....(sweeter horn!), but I just don't get the impression he was that ""INTO"" this music. All depends on what you are looking for, I suppose. For easy listening ""Pop"" music with a bluesey note, this is just super. For die-hard Chet Baker fans, maybe not so great. Quality of the recording is good. Just not Chet at his best, for my money.Would I buy it again? Maybe....just for the ultimate smooth background."
5,Chet Baker Sings,Chet Baker singing -- nothing could be better!I love Amazon.com. They have all the CDs I'm looking for and my packages come so fast!
3,Acquired Taste,"People are a bit too crazy with all the 5 star reviews. From a technical standpoint, he is a pretty poor vocalist. Most of the jazz vocals I have heard in local clubs are better than Chet and as for more widely known, recorded artists, they all leave Chet in the dust. Of course, technical skill is not the whole thing. Certain vocalists have a way of singing that resonates with some people. Chet is one of those kinds of singers. It is certainly possible to love his singing, but for many people, it would be an acquired taste. For those who really put a lot of emphasis on technical skills, it is unlikely that they will ever be able to deal with Chet the singer."
2,emperor has no clothes (nor voice),"after hearing a couple of these songs on another disc and reading the reviews here, i eagerly looked forward to listening to this cd. how disappointed i was! except for a handful of tunes, these songs are horrible! am i the only person who thinks chet baker can't sing? every phrase makes me cringe. the only thing that qualifies this as 'singing' is the sweet little vibrato he tacks on at the end of phrases. it almost saves him every time. just awful. two good things: 1, finally, here's a disc where i can sing along with and not feel like i'm overmatched; 2, i 'only' paid $8 so i don't feel like i was totally jipped.if you're considering this cd, you MUST listen to the samplers here, AND go down to your local cd store and ask them to let you listen to the other cuts. THEN AND ONLY THEN should you shell out the $$$."
1,Would Hate To Hear The Worst,"Chet Baker certainly does have his apologists. Phrases such as, ""He can't sing, but ..."" are repeated like mantras. Fact is, he just plain can't sing. He has a sort of hipper-than-thou whisper that broadcasts, ""I'm such a sensitive artiste."" For some reason, people bought it. Blame it on the good looks, the smack habit, the James Dean act, and the times, which glorified everything unstudied and done badly - (read Kerouac). He was a nice, if unremarkable, horn man. But that singing, wow. You'll get more passion from your dishwasher, and more technique too. Baker's real brilliance was in passing off attitude for art, something that survives to this day. He was at the avante garde of being a poseur."
5,Un cantante genial,La voz de Chet Baker es una delicada tragedia. Sus canciones románticas y sensuales nos transportan a un lugar tranquilo y lleno de jazz.
2,Not for the complicated estate,"This book is an excellent guide if you are settling an estate where there is a will, no messy record keeping, and no lack of attention by the dead person to their assets, and absolutely no complications. If anything is outside the perfect Stepford-like world then this book is likely to mislead you. It is too simplified to make you aware of the nuances of California Probate Law. A better resource is How to Probate an Estate in California by Julia Nissey."
2,Not worth 20 bucks,"If you look at the table of contents, you will see that the number of pages devoted to basic technical analysis indicators is absolutely minimal (e.g., MACD). This book is only 59 pages and, therefore, omits all but the most basic. I just don't think that it's worth $20. As many of you know, you can go to various technical anaysis web sites and print out---for FREE---equally/ more helpful information. This publication is really more of an introductory pamphlet than a bona fide book on TA."
3,This is a dictionary not an encyclopedia,You get what you pay for on this one. Clear writing with good examples but a beginners guide only. There isn't anything in this book you could not find on the web. Also have noticed the author not speaking what is obvious in the charts regarding the market when interviewed so far in 2002.
2,technical analysis,very basic charting indicators are explained in this book. Might not be usefull to the novice trader who needs more specific and examples. The diagrams are really hard to distinguish.
4,OHP7000 Works Great,Easy to configure and install. This system mated right up with a NEC 2000 PBX. We recorded our own greeting and were operating within a couple of hours.
2,started out interesting.. bogged down somewhere,"This started out as an interesting look at books and the passions that surround them. When he got into the 20th century and started detailing the obsessive behaviours of certain more contemporary collectors at excessive length, I lost interest. I've been working on it gradually for several months because I'm no longer able to read more than a few pages at a time, and still haven't finished."
3,An ongoing madness,"This was a good book, although a trifle long, and delving into area's of book collecting that I was not personally interested in. I was hoping for something that would give me insights into book collecting in general. I chose the wrong book, and cannot blame tbe author for that."
1,Strictly amateur,"The only people impressed by Basbanes' books are those who don't really know very much about books, book collecting, libraries, or the antiquarian trade. This volume in particular is plagued with sloppy scholarship, conjecture, gossip, and unsubstantiated anecdote. He can't even get the names of major libraries right. It's certainly a fun read, but it shouldn't be taken seriously."
5,the best one yet,"This is the best album yet. I've been listening to this one album for almost 15 years and not a scratch on it. I am looking for it on cd. My gospel groups sings the song, Take Me Higher, and hopefully touches someone everytime we sing it. Let's keeep supporting gospel music. God bless."
3,Good,"This is a great single! It is very creative using hip hop, a little pop, and using pots and pans as insturments! It is a good song to dance to or listen to. After a long time this song might get old and boring, but it will always sound good! I think that soon (in about a year or so) Before Dark might become very popular. This single would be great for party music, or just listening to in the car, so i'd suggest it, but don't listen to it for too long, because then it will get very boring!"
5,Fond Childhood Memories,"This book harkens fond childhood memories. My parents bought me this book when I was a young child, and I still remember the coniving, porcine Mr. Faber and all the other wonderful characters, as well as the eye-catching, green-tinged illustrations. A wonderful read for an elementary school student. Sit down and explore the magic with your child or grandchild. Even if you have to purchase a secondhand copy, it's worth it."
1,"This is ""Awakened Mind System"" and ""Awakened Mind 2.0"" sold repackaged...sort of","I love these CDs, I've almost worn them out....but not in this packaging. I bought them as single discs, saw this, and from what I could tell it was not the same as the single discs...WRONG!"
3,Smokie goes Christmas with ups and downs,"I like the Smokie sound, but when it comes to cristmas song it`s up`s and downs. .When it comes to the slow songs, it`s to sloooooow sometimes. Terry Uttley is the only one back from the classic Smokie, and he`s playing bassguitar. The best thing whith theire Christmas album is that the smokie sound is all trough the songs, and gives the traditional songs a certain flaire. If your`e looking for an CD with something to rockin around the cristmas tree too this is certainly not "" that cup of tea"". Track 11 White Cristmas is a treat and something different for the versions you have heard before. But please Smokie put in at least two songs with more rock and roll next time. A boogie woogie here and there. I dont mind at all."
1,This movie is 25 minutes too long,"This has to be without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm sorry I didn't take the one reviewers advice and rent it, no, instead I spent thirty bucks on this piece of trash. All this video is, is some guys butts (you don't even see their faces half the time, but then would you put your face on this?) aimed at the camera and what appears to be farting. And a lot of laughing. I'm sorry but most of the farts in this so called movie seem to be fake, one part you can even see the guys mouth making the fart sounds. I can't believe I wasted $30 on this and I am going to see about returning it. I could have made a better fart movie with me and some friends. At least my farts would have been authentic. This was awful."
1,Algebra CD,"Looked like it would be great, but when I got it I saw on its label that it is a windows only product.Sure wish it was for Mac OS X as advertised. :-("
3,Available to you,"This wasn't the entire cd like I expected it to be. There were several songs that were missing. Otherwise, it was a good cd but not worth the amount it cost."
2,Not the actual cd-- just the instrumental lead song,"I was looking to replace my 20-year-old cassette tape with the audio cd. But this cd just has several instrumental versions of the title song.There was nothing to clarify that on the item description when I ordered it. It was just listed with the group's other recordings, so you really couldn't tell the difference. (Maybe the ""no image available"" was the best clue, b/c I defintely wouldn't have ordered it if I had seen its generic cd cover in advance.)But I decided to keep it anyway. Since I'm a music director and it's the only song I ever play from the album, I'll probably be able to use the instrumental cd for an upcoming program. Plus, I never heard of this cd company and it may have other stuff I can use."
4,A good Overall look at Ancient Rome,I recommend this book to anyone whom is looking for a generalized Historical background on Ancient Rome. Not a good source for specific detail.
5,A wonderful text for science majors,"I have used this book as an undergraduate course text at the North South University, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Students with good math background do not have too much trouble but businees students really struggle with the materials. It is very difficult to cover the book in one semester. It would be nice to point out the absolute necessary sections in each chapter. Instructor's manual was also not available to me."
1,Bad book,"The book gets confusing at points and the author assumes many concepts which defeat the purpose of being ""Elementary"". I have struggled at how he comes up with the answers. For example chapter 4 is so confusing!!!"
5,The best book of Sephardic Jewish History,"This is a wonderful book. It is well written, objective, and there is a lot of interesting information. I've had this book for several years and I learn something new each time I read it. I've read many books about Sephardic history and it is by far my favorite. It's the book that inspired me to learn more and even study in Israel."
4,A refreshing look at a unique time and people,"Gerber presents a piece that tells the story of the often neglected Sephardic Jew. In her piece, one can appreciate this group of jewry and realize their struggles and triumphants in a world that does not understsnd their purpose. Her treatment of the inquistion material in particular is breath taking and conjures up images of the modern inquistion across Europe that was the holocaust."
1,Taken by Amazon,"I did not get what was advertised and what I ordered. Amazon's short description did not allow the detail of the batter head, i.e. ""reverse dot"" to be displayed in the description so I ended up buying the product I did not want. What I ordered was a Evans EC1, period. What I got was a Evans EC1 Reverse Dot. The reverse dot was not mentioned in the ad or any of the descriptions."
5,"Bruce Marchiano's ""Meeting Jesus""",Another great book by Mr. Marchiano. He has a way of putting into words what is in your heart. His writing style paints pictures and makes Jesus so much more tangible to me!
5,This is a WONDERFUL CD!,"I am not one who listens to ""this kind"" of music in general (whatever that means!), but I was in a store shopping and this CD was being played on their stereo. The music so entranced me that I asked what it was and bought it one the spot. It's wonderful--so rich and full of life, so fun and also meaningful. I hear the music in my head even when I'm not listening to it. I highly recommend this CD to all music lovers."
5,The best touching chants that can be,"...At the last minute, I decided to check what is new and found Krisna Das. So surprised and what a joy. I first heard this CD in a workshop and a few of us did yoga there. Then the chants just didn't leave me. Luckily, I found one in Santa Monica, and could never find another one from the same store. When some copies hit the store, they just vanished. That's why when I got a second copy in SF, I made some copies for friends and myself just in case I lose it.Not all songs are super nice, but most songs are and very powerful. It is probably by far the most moving CD for me. It can reach your soul and deepening yourself. Best is to have a long drive with this, it will stir your inner well. I like the CD so much that I had an impulse to buy one when I saw it in London last month. So get it, if not, there is a long waiting list anyway if you don't like it."
1,Everything you have read is wrong,"After reading the reviews and comments I purchased Pilgrim Heart~ Krishna Das along with a world beat masterpiece Myth ~ Chorus of Tribes.Advice: Please, Please listen to the samples before purchasing.Reason: While the music is fantastic it is drowned out by constant monotone off key chanting.Unlike most decent albums of this kin it will leave you more strengthless/depressed than elated/relaxed. I will keep this CD only to occasionally remind myself of depths that bad world/chant music can get to and to keep any furniture being damaged from a hot beverage."
5,Pleased as punch,I ordered this item from Amazon and it arrived in a timely manner. I ordered it used and was very pleased with the condition of the item. I would highly recommend this item to anyone looking to participate in a daily devotion. Thurman writes with such scholarly insight;yet he fully engages his reader and does not complicate his meaning with intellectual jargon. It is great reading!!!
2,Disappointed,"I read the reviews and thought I'd buy the table anyway and hopefully be lucky. Well I wasn't, a corner of it was damaged and the paint chipped. I covered it with a wood finish pen and it doesn't look all that bad. I'm definitly not ordering any other furniture though."
3,"Slow-moving, but well worth a look","Taking place at the tail end of the Old West era, King of the Grizzlies documents the story of Moh-Sum-See Wahb, a grizzly bear with an odd track-mark. He lives an idyllic life with his mother and his twin sister. He hunts, plays, meets a marmot and a badger, and even does some snow sledding on a vessel made of bark. As the events unfold, a narrator (Winston Hibler) tells us what we're seeing and what Wahb is presumably thinking and feeling. Eventually man comes into the picture, bringing with him a whole lot of trouble. The movie is slowly-paced and might bore the tykes, but the scenery and wildlife is breathtaking. Based upon The Biography of a Grizzly by Ernest Thompson Seton.Staci Layne Wilson"
5,Nice watch,"The watch is beautifull and delivery was very fast, I was shocked. The only thing is the watch has a light so u can see the time at night and in less than one month and the light don't work anymore. Not sure what it is."
3,O.K. but glaring design flaw,"Generally works pretty good. I like the large size which allows for one central position to catch oil from pan and filter at the same time. However, how hard is it to notice that the spout is facing the wrong direction. If it was designed like a fat strainer (think the cooking type) it would be perfect. Regardless of whether you put the cap on or not, it will leak oil out of that spout after each and every oil change."
2,"Not bad, but.....","....don't expect the cap to last long! It was broken by trying to tighten it enough to keep the oil from dripping out. The pan is great for catching the oil, but not great for when you want to move it."
2,Not for the clumsy,"Blitz has an oil collector with a sloped lid to aid in containing sloshing oil as the pan is moved (dragged) along garage floor. I have used both types, yellow & black, go with the black plastic model with closed top unless you have a high end garage with 'lots of room' and really good tools at hand."
5,Best Pedometer For The Price,"When I first ordered this Pedometer I thought it was going to be crap due to the low price, but I was surprised it was not bad. It turned out to be a great item for the price. When I go for my walk I take it with me and so far it's given a perfect readout. If you are looking for a Pedometer and do not want to spend a lot then this is worth a try.Reviewed by Vendingmatic.info"
3,"It works, for the price","Bought one for personal use, and it works well for what it's supposed to do. No advanced functions, but you can track plenty of stats with it. It's not very durable though, as I accidentally dropped it once and the cover came off (although it still works)"
2,Too easy to loose,"I suppose that this pedometer might work okay if it had a better way to keep it in place. I have worn it three times and each time lost it off my belt because it doesn't have a good enough fastener.The last time it was lost I found it in the street before it was run over by a vehicle. So, it is still in one piece but I don't try to use it."
1,I wish I knew,I wish I knew....it's been 5 days since I ordered it and it hasn't even shipped yet! What poor service!
3,"Tarantulas and other arachnids, Good begginners book","This book was a great help when it came to aspects of arachnid keeping such as feeding, living conditions and mating. This was my first book when I was begginning to keep Tarantulas and it taught me what I needed to know about keeping my pet happy and comfortable. It also was very informative when it came to the biology of the arachnids and explianed about everything from thier fangs to thier spinnerets. The only major problem I found with this book is it's insufficient explaination of spider habits and psychology. Because I was a begginner I wasn't sure how my spider felt and what it's different reactions to events meant. This book is excellent for begginners and I would recommend it to anyone starting out with arachnids although anyone with interests in arachnids behaviour then you should possibly consider a book which concentrates on it."
3,A helpful book Containing many information about Tarantulas.,"This book is a guide, nothing else. It contains many information that helps a person how to understand and raise tarantulas giving many helpful alternatives to the reader .That help the reader in my ways such as guide would probably would do. This book explains that people how raise tarantulas face many tasks.For people how are looking for information for tarantulas this book would be a good help.In the other hand if a person is looking for help or information on any of the arachnids mention here they would need another book."
5,Almost as good as being there (warmer too)!,This book is for anyone who wants to see the beauty of ionized gases at our poles without having to wait into the wee morning hours in temperatures most could only stand for minutes in extremely remote areas. Most people would go through life missing such beauty if it were not for people like Todd who use their talent to provide us a brief glimpse of what beauty the earth can provide. Todd has a talent for being at the perfect place during the perfect time to record each and every unique experience with perfection. This is a must see book for all.Thanks Salat!
2,Just doesn't work,"This book presents a series of techniques that don't take much time to practice, that arguably will improve your vision. It claims that these techniques can reduce (if not fix) a lot of eye problems.I've found that some of them are good but just for some very short time. Like focusing far away into some distant object, witch alleviates myopia, but only for some small time.But despite this temporary vision problem reduction, these techniques will do no good at all; instead if you don't use your prescribed eyeglasses, you'll end up with worst vision problems.Conclusion: You don't really need eyeglasses, you can try contact lenses ;)"
1,"Yes, I Do, As Badly As Before","This book didn't work for me. My eye sight is as bad as it used to be. None of the exercises improved it. I also felt like an idiot doing the tricks the author recommends. The Swinging exercise is especially ridiculous. Maybe I am beyond this kind of placebo help but I find this book pure quackery. Don't waste your money, go see a qualified eye doctor instead!"
3,"Good Sherlock Holmes outing with a clever, inventive script","This film and ""The Scarlet Claw"" are generally considered to be the best of the Universal Holmes series. Rathbone and Bruce are in good form with a clever and resourceful script to back them up and Miles Mander gives a fine performance as Giles Conover,master criminal."
4,This One Will 'Creep' You Out!,"Here is yet another solid Sherlock Holmes entry, featuring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. This story centers around a chase by crooks to seize a valuable pearl, a bunch of murders that take place as a result of that pursuit, and Holmes trying to make sure the pearl stays with its rightful owner.It turns out the pearl is hidden in one of six plastic Napoleon busts. Whoever buys these busts winds up dead by a hired killer, monstrous fiend called ""The Creeper,"" a huge man-beast who literally breaks backs.Holmes (Rathbone) narrowly avoids getting hurt several times himself while Watson (Bruce) mumbles his way through to provide comic relief. Dennis Hoey, who plays ""Inspector Lestrade,"" is as dumb as a brick and adds more humor to the story."
3,Not the best Holmes...,"It's a fun mystery, and it's fun to see even Holmes struggle. However, it was a little intense and violent for such an old movie. The ending was especially chilling."
4,tools for work,3m is a quality product that I have trusted for over 20 years. there is no one out there that makes a better cut off whell as far as I am concerned.
5,"if you're here,you'll like it!",if you enjoy the music of all these great musicians by all means do yourself the favor of picking this up. you will treaure it for a lifetime.
4,Ames True Temper 24004 Stone EDge Edging,"This product is very easy to install, minimum amount of preparation. Has a very attractive appearance."
5,Ames True Temper Lawn Edging,"I've used lawn edging for a long time around my flowers, which is very extensive. This not only looks good, but is easy to install. I was using the black pound in type and could never keep it straight or one of the squirrels would knock it over. I'm hoping this lasts for a long time and is from an ""old"" tried and true manufacturer."
3,Stone Lawn Patio Edging,"I was trying to add to the Stone Lawn edging that I'd purchased a couple of years ago from Home Depot. After scouring all the stores in our vicinity without luck, I was finally directed to this web site and there they were. Or so I thought. My mistake. The original ones I had bought looked like part of an ancient Roman wall, or some such. They had a 2 inch top and were kept in place by matching spikes that one could pound into the ground. These new ones looked the same from the side, but there is no top as in the others. They look OK, and I've added them at the (nearly hidden) sides, but I should have read the dimensions more carefully. As for the company, the order arrived promptly and in perfect condition."
5,Classic movie about running a circus,Classic John Wayne movie about trying to keep his circus alive and circus family together through several disasters that seams to plague this circus and at the end they help him out too.
1,Will NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM HERE AGAIN!!!!,"I am a big John WaynE fan and I have a nice collection of his films. When I saw that I could order a DVD on this site. I thought that it would be great to have it. When I recieved it, I couldn't wait to play it. It was horrible!!!! The quality of it was cheap and the sound was so bad that all I could hear was a sound that sounded like a jet plane echoing in the back ground. A lot of the times you couldn't even hear the actors words. This was a big disapointment to me and it would make John Wayne's grave turn over. If you plan to order anything from Amazon.com DON'T YOU WILL BE SORRY!!! And don't even try to get your money back bacause you will have to pay for the postage to return your purchase and by then you would of lost your money on just shipping charges. I WILL NEVER ORDER ANYTHING FROM AMAZON AGAIN!!!"
1,Awful copy of Circus World,"Circus WorldThis dvd isn't even worth the small amount of money I paid for it. I would have paid a better price but this was all that was available to me. The quality of the sound, plus the speaking was out of alignment with the mouths moving. Over all I was displeased with this product. What is so terrible that we here in USA have far more ablity to re-product such great classics but don't. It makes no sense to me that we can't buy GOOD quality producted dvd's of great movie classics. How about doing much more about this! We are going to loose such fine entertaining movies such as this one! K. M. Kemp"
4,Hmm....Not quite what I was expecting,"I watched this movie a couple of days ago, and I was really very surprised. I LOVE John Wayne's movies, and have seen around 90 of them. (The number is steadily increasing!) *Circus World* was a good movie, but I didn't think it was quite as impressive as the rest of Duke's movies, especially his later ones. The filming quality seemed a bit poor, and the storyline wasn't the best. Don't get me wrong, I think this movie's a great one-timer! Just not my favorite. Watch it, enjoy it, and see if you agree!"
1,Circus World,"The product arrived damaged as it was only sent in a plastic bag. The seal was not broken, but the case damaged and the DVD sliding around inside."
2,Circus World,"Old style movie, simple plot, not as good as the Charlton Heston circus movie, The Greatest Show on Earth."
1,What's the delay? Get this movie on US DVD,"I recently found out that John Wayne's Circus World is available on DVD in Europe, but not in the US. Could someone please explain that to me? Almost every other Duke film is available but this one is being withheld for some reason. I have never seen this movie because it is rarely shown on TV and even rarer to find on video tape. Get this movie on US DVD so I won't have to buy a European DVD of it. It is ironic that the movies starring the most American of actors are not all available in America. Why do Europeans have the privelege of watching this movie? European distributors are making the profits that could have been for American distributors. That alone should be motivation to get this movie on DVD here."
1,circus world,THIS PRODUCT IS A COPY OF ORIGINAL. PIRATED. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY. AMERICAN THEIVES
5,Must Have Item For Any John Wayne Collector,"Very good movie, hard to find but worth looking for. Not your average John Wayne if you are used to his westerns or war movies but a nice change. I enjoyed seeing him in a different role and I am sure he enjoyed doing something different as well. Lots of great scenery and fun circus feats for the kids."
3,Family entertainment,"Claudia Cardinale is gorgeous here. She is evidently the best ingredient in the film. Good enough movie for a family gathering in the afternoon. Melodrama, grand sets, Claudia and the Duke all together.Now about my copy: A region 2 from Spain. It includes among the extras (only text extras) a Spanish film critic criticizing Mr. Wayne -but not for the way he does his role- for getting rid of Frank Capra, as he was the original director for this work, and bringing his pal Henry Hathaway in. And then the critic proceeds to award him three derogatory names. Well, Mr. Wayne isn't around anymore to defend himself, but I say this: You can't insult the Duke and have my money. I'm not buying anymore European Region 2 copies.By the mouth dies the fishBy their deeds you will know them"
3,Circus World,"This film is one that is rarely ever shown on TV. While it is certainly not one of John Wayne's Bests, it is worth having in your collection (if you're a real Duke fan), just because of the rarity of it. It is not typical John Wayne fair, but the Duke always delivers a fine performance in his movies, regardless of the subject matter. Rita Hayworth's performance, while good, was not one of her best, either. She usually plays the spitfire image. However, perhaps because she is older here, she is much more subdued. All in all, I enjoyed the movie, but it is not one that I would watch very often. I am glad, though, that I have added it to my John Wayne Collection."
4,"Very Nice High Def Print, but...............","For some reason, Circus World has rarely been seen in this country over the last 30 years and it has been very hard to find on home video. The current French blu ray does play on Region A blu ray players despite its region B notations and it a beautiful high definitiion print. The only thing preventing a 5 star rating is that the French sub titles cannot be removed when watching the English language version of the film. And that is mildly annoying."
5,An excellent book to start programing.,I was interested in learning C++. When I went to my bookstore all of the other books were boring and too technical. This book will teach you how to program well.
3,Educational and informative a good starting point,I found the book to be an excellent starting point into the world of C++ programming. However I did find the conversation with another who was new in programming to be a bit destractive. His book however did provide me with enough basics to create and write my own C++ program right away. Rich Eaton
5,Speedy delivery,"I was not expecting to receive the purchase before Christmas, so was thrilled when I received it within a few days of ordering. The travel bag was an excellent choice for a gift."
4,Dopp classic,The Dopp kit I bought was exactly what I ordered and is a fantastic product. It was shipped quickly and I'm very satisfied. Thank you.
2,Low quality,The problem is the leather is so stiff that its hard to reach inside without the zipper ripping your hand. The leather feels more like hard plastic. Tried to like it but after a few months I dislike it more and more.
4,The Quintessential Choir,"""To defend your spirit I would go to war, I would chase the devil to Jehovah's door."" Just one of many great lyrics on this record. This one, along with ""Speckled Bird"" are must haves by this group."
1,Damaged product X 2,I returned the first one due to crinkling and streching in the material. The replacement was the same. Amazon wisely refunded my purchase and did not send a third.
2,Dissapointed,Kate Kray had access to some incredibly intriguing and facinating men but this book falls short of delving into the interesting stories these characters have to tell. Honestly it was a tease. I get the feeling for personal and legal reasons her subjects did not want to divulge their facinating stories that we as readers would have loved to find out about.Great concept..... not nearly enough content.
1,Simply an edited version of Sven's 'Book of Tiki',"I was looking forward to reading this book as I throughly enjoyed Kirsten's 'Book of Tiki' and the synopsis of this book led me to believe it was a new work by Sven Kirsten. I was quite dismayed to find that 'Tiki Style' simply appears to take 18 of the 23 chapters in Kirsten's 'Book of Tiki' , cut out a good portion of the chapters' accompanying photos along with their captions, and reprint them under a new title. I could not find a single image or line of text in this book that hasn't been directly copied over from 'Book of Tiki' (even the chapter titles remain the same). This book's only saving grace is the price makes it an affordable alternative for anyone who can't get their hands on a copy of 'Book of Tiki'. However, if you already own 'Book of Tiki' you'd be wise to stay away from this one."
2,how times have changed,"I've only started reading romance in the last year or two, and if this is an example of what romance books were like in the eighties, I would have hated them then.The heroin is completely under the thumb of the various men in the story, and in particular under the 'hero's' - it seems more like an abusive relationship than a love story: he decides everything and she gives a token protest and then surrenders.If you're interested in seeing how romance has evolved in the last quarter century, then read it, but that's about the only thing it's worth reading for."
2,Lacking...,"I was looking forward to reading the different reviews of BMW motorcycles in this book as I would expect from articles in MotorCyclist magazines. However, I find that the reviews posted were very inconsistent. Pictures are only black and white. Specifications are not even given in most of the reviews, and a some of the reviews don't even have a single picture with it."
1,WORST BOOK,"I bought this book thinking it would help me make good decisions when taking medications. Was I wrong. It is very confusing and any real information about specific drugs is not included. Furthermore, all the nonperscription alternative medicine drugs and supplements are advised not to be taken. If I had paid more than .07 cents for it, I would have tried to get my money back. This book is a waste of time. I tossed it."
2,Volumious info,"Book is a very large version, more info than you really need.I didn't like the way it was organized, I had to look in too many places to find what Ineeded."
5,worst pills best pills,"My Mom had this book in Florida and when my Dad was in the hospital it was a valuable tool to research the medications that the doctors wanted to give him. My Mom could enlighten the doctors that people over 60 shouldn't be given some of the medications and that they could also react with some of the ones he was taking. Since the book has alot of information in it, it is quite heavy and makes it hard to bring it back and forth from FL to CT, so I was pleased to have found it on Amazon.com. The book is an updated verson of my Mom's and is a wonderful source of info. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to find out more info on medications."
2,tntexgal,While this book has some good information (but the accuracy of some of the prescriptions is questionable)...it can also be bad. My mother has ordered this book for years and as a result of her strong belief in every word that's in it - it almost cost her her life a week ago. She had stopped taking her blood pressure and cholestrol medications without the family knowing (because of the book telling her the medications were dangerous) and as a result almost died. Had she not have taken 2 aspirin when she felt the stroke symptoms coming (and called for help) she would be in a coma or dead today. Be careful if you buy this book that you realize most perscribed medications DO have some kind of side effect...but you must have confidence in your doctor and communicate with him.
2,Armour Thyroid is a worst pill? BS!,"Oh Please.... the author didn't do enough research on thyroid pills if he can even mention Armour and ""worst pills"" in the same sentence.Yeah, I could just see me now if I didn't have a script for this ""worst pill"". I'm sure the medical community would like us hypo's depressed, balding, feeling crazy, tired, out of control triglycerides etc.. They would get so much more money telling us ""it's all in our heads"" (duh, our throats, too) and give up all sorts of scripts for anti-depressants, cholesterol, etc..Knowing all this from personal experience I don't trust the rest of this book without doing research of my own. Waste of time!"
2,not the best choice,the pronunciation isn't always clear and the native speakers speak to quickly. the method is ok but thai is a difficult language and needs a slower approach.
4,Easy to learn..nit noy...a little.,"Great way to keep interest in learning a language. I feel like I'm learning, it's easy, so I enjoy it ....that's the key, or at least one of them.Thanks!!!!"
2,Course for people with audio memories,"Since the course is all audio,nothing written at all. This suits people with mainly audio memories,not people like me with a much better visual memory, i.e. I need to see a word or name written,in order to remember it well. I should also mention that the Thai speaking lady is better suited for an onstrtuction course for beginners, since her diction is clearer and she also speaks at a more reasonable tempo than her male counterpart."
4,Very good buy for an intro to Thai Conversation,"I have used other programs such as Rosetta Stone for other languages, and although it is a good program as well, I found that in learning a language that I know nothing about; Pimsleur's Thai Conversational was much easier to understand and helped set a foundation to better understand.Phrases are given to you, and then they broken down by the words, and after a few lessons, you start to get a good grasp of the flow of sentence structure, and find yourself taking words that you've learned and you can reform them to create your own phrases that you may want to say.Throughout the lessons, each new lesson touches on phrases in past lessons, so as to help keep the overall course fresh in your head.It is only 16 lessons at a half an hour each, which the course instructs you to learn one a day. Although it is not a full course, it gives quite a bit of the language to get you started, and for the price, it is more than worth it."
5,Better than the advertised 'best',"I have used this product for several years..........after trial and error with other products. No matter what the stain, this product works! What more can I say? Apparently, the supermarkets have taken it off the shelves (i.e. Acme Markets, Giant, Shop Rite). It is a shame because this is the only one that beats the competition. It may not be as cheap as others, but it works! If you want to get rid of stains, try it. You won't want to use anything else. This is why I stocked up (just in case)."
5,The BEST stain remover on the market!,"I can't find it in stores, so I just purchased a boxload through Amazon.com. Why? This stuff is just so worth it! It removes blood, ink, grass stains, ring around the collar dirt, you name it, and usually on the first application. Once in a while, a really big, ground in stain will take a 2nd wash, but Dual Power is heads and shoulders above all other brands. I know, I've tried them!"
5,Snacks,"These are delicious little treats but didn't last long in this household, highly recommend. Arrived properly packaged and in damaged, also very fresh."
4,A Teutonic Onegin,"Not immediatly expecting it was a bit of a suprise to hear it in German. The voices are really nice.Having known most of the singers,the tenor Dermota came as a really nice treat. I may be a bit stuffy but I would rather hear it the original Russian. I thought that the sound was quite good. Beware of the language,but you will not be disappointed with the singing."
3,Also known as Angels of Doom.,"(Another possible alternate title is She Was a Lady.)This book is in the middle period of the Saint's career - after his early swashbuckling days, but still during his running battles with Claud Eustace Teal of Scotland Yard.Jill Trelawney (daughter of a distinguished man) in the wake of her father's death and disgrace, has founded the Angels of Doom - a criminal organization with some echoes of the Saint's own early days...how can the Saint resist getting involved?"
2,Not as good as I remembered.,"I read this in my misspent youth, and rather enjoyed it then. Today, it creaks more than authritic joints. Leslie Charteris has a certain flair, but does not hold up well with time, as the occasional pleasantries of his ""Toodle-do, old turnstyle, as the bishop said to the show girl."" Saintly patter are not enough to obscure the weakness of his plots."
5,Learn From Experienced Professionals,"The major task in learning research methods involves developing the necessary skills to analyze and assess research data. This superb book takes you into the mindset of seasoned mass media research professionals sharing the essential truth about mass media research. The authors' years of expertise are apparent. Their goal, to introduce the reader to mass media research using a minimum of technical terms and a maximum of practical guidelines, is achieved with an entertaining mix of humorous insights and sage advice. The text is a valuable resource for both beginners and advanced researchers alike. The scope is truly comprehensive, the writing style clear and accessible. Mass Media Research is an absolute must for every mass media research student and professional."
5,Best book I have ever,Easy to read and organized book. Give you a lot of valuable information in mass media research and statistic. I like it and I highly recommend this book FOR everyone who is interested in mass media field.
1,Save Your Money,"This is an incomplete guide. It is more like an outline that was never completed. If this were turned into for a grade in school it would rate an F. It is not focused, does not answer any questions, nor raise any pertinent issues."
2,MUY DEFICIENTE,y nada bien escrito... Lo digo porque he leído mucho de Feng Shui y compre este libro...
4,Fine Tool For The Close-in Work,"I am a real estate invester, and from time to time, we install ceiling fans at the rental properties. It seemed to always be a hassle installing the tiny screws to the crown that finished flush against the ceiling.As events developed, I was going to have to replace my own fan in our kitchen. Thus the ordering of the Klein spring-loaded screw holder. The tool worked fine and I would have no touble recommending it.Rossi"
1,It don't work,"Tried every size and type of screw ,it wont hold any. Had my two sons try. Nothing works . tempted to trash this crap. BILL S"
1,Horrible!,"I never thought a piece of electronics could inspire so much hatred in me.1st - It distorts the aspect ratio on my (very typical) TV. Messing with the settings changes distorts the problem even more but doesn't fix it.2nd - No search buttons on DVD. Instead you have to hold down the track change buttons. God I hate that!3rd - The search thing doesn't even work like its supposed too. You hold the button for a long time and the thing just gets really confused, spins for awhile, then spits you out to another track. And all i wanted to do was rewind a few seconds.4th - It takes forever to load or do anything and won't play even slightly damaged discs that work fine on other players.If you buy this you are asking for pain. Stay away!"
1,Don't buy it!!,"I bought this Samsung DVD/VCR combo because I have had good Samsung products in the past, and I needed a black unit to match my other components.I hooked it up through my home theatre system, but it only plays through the home theatre speakers if I'm playing a DVD, but not a VHS tape. When I asked Samsung's tech support why that was they replied VHS doesn't have that capability. Hmmmm, my other VHS player did...how odd.Also, everytime I play a VHS tape, it eats the tape!!!Also, no slow motion capability for the DVD player!!!I'm very disappointed with this unit."
4,"Short, catchy and well written songs.","Paradise Lost, one of the founders of English Doom Metal, deliver a modern heavy rocking album. Although the band sounds heavier than their previous record Host, they do not return to the more heavy sounds on early records. The songs are short, catchy and well written. If you are searching for songs with lengthy instrumental parts, then do not buy this album. The songs are vocal orientated. Fortunately vocalist Nick Holmes impresses me very much on Believe In Nothing. Although the songs are extremely catchy, they have a depressive atmosphere. So do not expect happy catchy songs. The only real negative aspect of the album is that the album could have been better if some songs were longer and more challenging to listen to. On most of the songs the pace does not really change and adding some instrumental parts could have made the album better."
3,hmmm...,"Can't hate it, can't love it either.Yes, this is heavier than host (not better) but still something is missing... what happen with the lead guitars?!?!?!, they are average at the most... another thing i don't like is the bass drum, sounds like a box of cookies been hit it by a child!! seems they can't match the gothic beauty of one second (the best for me), or the so long ago new and unique sound of draconian times (the best for the majority).they have added more guitars but still i think host is better than this one, because it was more shaped and defined into thecno (metal heads scream!!!!!!)and then had more personality.Don't get me wrong, this is better than all the nu-metal... of this days, but I think PL can, and hope they will, do it much more perfect... we have to wait till next time..."
2,No; buy Symbol of Life,"This album is getting good reviews here, and it's nice to see people still keen on Paradise Lost. Unfortunately, this album was ""lost"" on me. Their newest one, Symbol of Life, is an excellent album. It's dark and heavy and has incredible hooks. To me, Believe in Nothing sounded more like Nickelback. Yes, it's heavier than what they were doing for a while, but I find it pretty uneventful, and there's certainly nothing gothic about it."
3,"hmm... well better then ""host"" still no comparison to ""icon""","okay, ""host"" was not a desaster, but pretty disappointing. it just didn't sound like anything innovative anymore. this still has too much of hosts elements to recover the brilliant ""icon"" / ""draconian times"" sound. this album is not bad, it has some decent tracks like ""i am nothing"" but still, it's far behind ""draconian times"" and ""icon"""
4,One of the best singles,"For me, this is the best single in the 'jason-era'. All songs are well mixed and pleasant to hear.The end of the world is a good pop song and I recommend you to watch the official video as is probably one of the most interesting Cure videos in the last 15 years.I like ""This Morning"" specially for how good the instruments sound.""Fake"" is one of the best b-sides released in the last years, almost reminding me to the ones of the Wish era, with those ambient & percussion background sounds but the drum sound still leaves much to be desired. Fake is the best song and the reason I purchased this CD.In conclusion, I recommend this single to fans and non-Cure fans."
5,Basket Weaving Techniques & Easy Ideas,"Includes: Coil, Vine, Log Cabin, Bark Cone & Wire Planting Baskets. The Second chapter includes projects & techniques for customizing store bought baskets, antiquing a basket & making living (plant & flower) baskets"
2,Unexplained potty humer...,"My daughter rec'd 'Miffy says I love you' for her 1st Birthday & loves it so much that I went against my usual rule of reading a book first before purchasing, & bought this one...BIG mistake. The book ends with a close-up picture of a dog's anus & a pile of poo! Now I'm all for a little potty humer, if explained, but it goes without any explanation & the picture is pretty graphic. Without showing the dog's frontside, how would my 15 month old even know it's a dog! Pass on this Miffy book & go for 'Miffy says I love you'..."
1,miffy jumps the shark,This family with an 18 month old has been enjoying Dick Bruna's wonderful Miffy books and looked forward to adding to our collection. Miffy's Magnifying Glass went right back to Amazon upon getting a look at the last page. Miffy's a cutie but this one is a bomber.
5,Excellent Project,"1989 release produced by Bill Maxwell, features Daniel with many members of the family and some great musicians. Songs are:Better Things for YouLet Brotherly Love ContinueWhen Love ShowsYou Got a Choice to MakeWalk in the LightOne of a KindNo More IAmerica's My IslandChinatownJust Fine"
3,does it really cut study time?,"Does the audio tapes really cut study time in half? or if not to zero? would it help with science subjects such as biology, physics, chemistry and maths? would it train the brain to make you think faster and be able to solve complex questions? I would like to know if it is really possible to just read the periodic table once, and remember every element after the training of the 8 tape course."
5,WOW,This book was assigned to my husband in a faith based class--I read it too. Gave our marriage a new edge! :)

5,Smooooth as silk,"Lou's first album, first released during 1962, plus the reissue has three previously unreleased tracks: Blues Is a Woman; A Little Les of Lou's Blues; and, an alternate take of Stormy Monday. Lou had signed with Capitol Records during 1961 after Nick Venet, A&R; scout for Capitol, watched him perform at Pandora's Box in Los Angeles.Les McCann is on piano; Leroy Vinnegar on bass; and, Ron Jefferson on drums. They are great. This album is the epitome of pre-Beatlemania in Hollywood clubs of the early 60s.And, Lou is great. What a voice. If you want background music for a romantic dinner or evening, this album should be on the top of your list. But, don't just wait for a special occassion. Buy this album and enjoy the incredible and talented Lou Rawls. You'll be glad you did."
3,The many sides of Johnny Cash.,Another in the collection of one of the most exciting entertainers of the past century. Love this man and his music.
3,Motherhood doesn't mean you need a therapist...,"but in the way motherhood is presented by Anne Lamott, it's a good thing she had one. This is a well-written book about a sensitive and often fearful adventure: new motherhood. As the other reviews state, it is shockingly honest. It is also painfully neurotic. It was difficult reading because I kept wondering how her little son was going to manage growing up in such a chaotic environment...It was an interesting read especially from a psychological perspective,"
3,"She's a little angry, yes..","I'd heard so much about his book that I picked it up at the bookstore yesterday. I happened upon one of the first entries, which delt with the subject of circumcision. She went into why she got her son circumcised. I found these two pages to be very negative! As my 7-month-old son is not circumcised, I felt that comments of hers like ""...needs Q-tips and 409 constantly to keep clean..."" to be extreamly ignorant and very misleading to other new mothers who might not yet have thought about this delicate and personal subject. I agree with others who have reviewed this book: the author did seem in a negative mindset-- at least when she wrote this entry. END"
3,Not what I thought it would be,"I was a little disappointed. I really like the concept of the book. But, I think the author spent way too much time spewing about her hatred for George Bush and her alcholism. I think it was just distracting. I wanted to read about her son and most of it was about other stuff. I did like how honestly she reported her feelings on her son though. It was nice to see I was not the only one that ever thought they might hate their child. I probably wouldn't recommend the book to anyone simply because it wasn't what I thought it would be."
5,Excellent Chain Sharpener,For commercial-like sharpening of chainsaw teeth you can't beat this piece of equipment. It is easy to put together and install either on the wall or a bench. Adjustments are not difficult to make but it does take some time figuring out exactly how to do both sets of teeth. The chain holder has to be moved from 30 degrees on one side to 30 degrees on the other and the chain turned around. The sharpener is really amazing. My neighbors come over regularly now to have me sharpen their saws.Excellent value. It straightens out damage we do to our saws by sharpening them in the field with a rat-tail file.
3,Interesting read but overflowing with Boomer self-indulgence,"No surprise that baby Sam grew up to be a teenager who knocked up his girlfriend on purpose. This book has lots of well-written passages that will have almost any parent nodding, understanding Lammott's frustration, adoration, fear and delight. And yet the author is so full of spite, self-righteous hatred and typical Boomer self-indulgence that by the end of the book I felt sad for Sam and worried - quite rightly, it turns out - for his future."
3,Didn't live up to my expectations,"I was not so impressed by this ""must-read"" journal of Lamott's trials and tribulations as she deals with her newborn. Maybe when it was published, it was taboo for a mother to casually remark that she'd like to throw her colicky baby out the window or confess that she let her infant fall off the futon (twice!), but in this age of mom-blogging, such confessions are almost trite. The journal reads exactly like a, well, journal, not my favorite type of reading material (I don't even like to read my own journals). I guess my expectations were a little higher."
5,funniest book in years,"I always buy this book for the perfect baby shower gift, but tell the new moms to read it after the baby is born. When my daughter was a baby I got this book as a gift and I don't think I've laughed so hard since. It's full of the bitter-sweet and funny and true and wonderful world of becoming a parent."
4,"Insightful, funny, and touching","Anne Lamott can certainly turn a phrase. She can go from raw and honest to wry, then turn on a dime to wrap up with breathtaking poignancy. I read her account of her first year of motherhood early in my pregnancy and look forward to reading it again after the birth of my first child. I'm sure it will resonate even more then."
5,Endearing and funny account of motherhood,Anne Lamott has this amazing gift of taking everyday details and turning them into mind blowing revelations and insights. I've read this book several times and it just gets better.
5,I have 2 copies!,"I wore out my first one, rereading it so often. I read it for the first time while I was pregnant, and have read it again a couple times a year since. I have given it as a gift to new mother friends at least a dozen times, and they have all loved it. Lamott has a magical way with language, a turn of phrase that makes me jealous of her talent. But I love her most for her honesty, that new motherhood is not all sweetness and light - and that on rare occasions one might truly wish to sell the baby to Gypsies and go to sleep for a week. And her willingness to let us into her heart and mind as she deals with the impending death of a dear friend is painful but so touching that it reminds me how much I value those closest to me. You will probably not like this book if you are politically or socially conservative, but readers with an open mind will likely be delighted with Lamott's wry and witty observations on life."
5,"Relief from run of the mill ""Baby"" books","Anne Lamott's book is a pleasure to read. It is a welcome view of motherhood as rife with ambivalence, difficulties, mood swings, etc. that is usually lost in books that are afraid to look into the negatives. Somehow though, despite this, it ends up being an affirmative and honest praise of parenthood."
5,It's nice to know I'm not the only one who felt this way!,I think the people that gave this book a negative review missed the point that it's a journal...it was what Anne Lamott was thinking as she was going through her son's first year. God forbid any of those people read my diary! I thought this book was extraordinary in how well she captured how much you can love and then hate this little human being you produced within the space of a few seconds. I will be buying this book for all my pregnant friends.
5,A must read!,Reading this book gave me the peace of mind to know that I was not the only inmate in the motherhood sanitarium! I will make this honest and wonderful book a gift to all my friends who have children in the future.
4,Great read,"I really enjoy Anne's writing. Honest, imaginative and poetic. She sees the world in truly interesting ways."
5,So this is why people want to become mothers!,"I am six months pregnant with my first child and looking for books that will help me set my expectations for the upcoming year. My sister, a mother of an 18-month old, recommended _Operating Instructions_ by Annie Lamott. It beautifully balances the horrors of colic and sleep deprivation with the relief of a supportive extended community and the joys of mothering. Also, Lamott is a luminous writer; her story made both my husband and me laugh out loud and ache painfully many times--sometimes at the same time. She doesn't have to say that she wouldn't miss being a mother for the world; one can feel the reasons with each page."
2,She's usually better than this,"Anne Lamott is a terrific writer, generally, but this book I could barely get through. I'm plenty liberal, so it wasn't Lamott's politics that bothered me, it was her extreme neurosis and narsicissm here that wore me down.I mean, I've got two kids, and I remember being pregnant with my first one. Of course I was scared and of course there's so much you don't know, but holy cow, this woman came across as frighteningly neurotic. I finished the book feeling sorry for her son, having a mother so riddled with over-the-top fears that she would be communicating to him. Yikes! I didn't feel very much sympathy for her here. Mostly, I wanted to shake her and tell her to get a freaking grip -- if not for her sake, than for her kid's."
5,a must read - especially for expectant mommies,"i read this book WELL before i was even pregnant. now that i've had my precious daughter, i think i will re-read this great book. it's a ""must read"" to add to your collection of pregnancy/parenting books, such as ""girlfriends guide to pregnancy"", ""what to expect when you're expecting"", etc. it gives a humorous, heartwarming, honest and unflinching account of what it's like to be a mom. (and a little on pregnancy too!) being someone who grew up in the same area that anne lamott did, it had a special nostalgia value for me. (SF Bay Area, Marin Cty.)"
3,enlightening,"Anne Lamott's account of motherhood was enlightening. I am a single woman over 35 who dreams of marriage and motherhood and found this book sobering. With sometime thoughts of just having a baby on my own, this gave me some more food for thought. Thanks for making the experience live for me."
5,"fantastic, didn't want it to end","I had the benefit of a very caring husband by my side during the first year and delivery of our son, but I found myself relating and cheering on annie's first year as a mother. the only caveat I would add is, it gets easier. my son is now almost two and every day with him a gift from God. the way she wove in other events and details from her life made this book electric. I've read it 3 times and it fully deserves to be the continual bestseller that it is. a soul-enriching journey and also very, very funny and extremely moving, as all her work is......"
4,Very good!,"I wanted to read this book so I could get a better understanding of what many of my friends are going through, and so I could begin to get some idea what I am in for when I have kids. This book offers excellent insight onto just how big of an impact having a child has on your life. It sounds like having a kid is about the most dramatic lifestyle change possible. I was also pleasantly suprised by the spirituality in the book. I may not share all of her beliefs, but it is always interesting to read how other Christians deal with the onslaught of the world around them. I would have given the book five stars, but the animosity towards George Bush, and conservatives in general, was a little much. I do understand that everyone is entitled to their own points of view, so, rather than putting down her beliefs, I will just relish the prospect of another George Bush taking up residence in the White House in the near future. Very funny, very touching, and a very good book. Highly recommended."
2,A baby is a little miracle. Now shut up.,"Reading this book felt like being stuck next to a new parent on a long plane trip. Either you're bored because you don't have kids, or you're bored because it is never your turn to talk about YOUR kid, or you are so kid-oriented and passive that you simply LOVE to hear all about the mundane ordinary pleasures that someone else gets from THEIR kid. If you are in the latter category, or you are perhaps a single mom in recovery and born again in Christ, you will enjoy this book. Otherwise, skip it and go spend some time with your real-life friends who have kids. They need the company, and the baby stories are all pretty much the same. Lamott's diary style offers 'reality' but little art."
1,"conservatives, beware","I just had my first baby (an amazing boy) & started reading this after he was born. I would not recommend for mothers, since the author drones on endlessly about her fears for her son. This only puts the same thoughts in the readers minds, things which never would have occurred to me before. I would also discourage anyone from reading this who is the slightest bit conservative. The author goes on and on about her hatred for Republicans and especially George Bush. She seems more interested in pushing a liberal agenda and teaching her son about fear and hatred than writing a good memoir. I found that part quite offensive, regardless of my political opinions. The only good thing I can say about this book is that it inspired me to write down my own observations, thoughts and feelings for my beloved baby boy, so that made it worthwhile."
1,disrespectful and vulgar,"As a mother of a toddler, I really love reading books about motherhood. This book was a huge disappointment. Perhaps Lamott wants to be witty, but her voice is that of a whiny adolescent who thinks mainly about herself. Ridden with issues and vulgar language, she makes a mockery of those who take motherhood seriously. She has issues with men, with Republicans, with the world, it seems, as she describes her first year with her son. I could not understand her choice of vulgar words when describing her baby. She seems to have tremendous support from her family, friends, and church community, yet she never seems to revel in what she has been given. Perhaps in raising her child, she will receive some ""operating instructions"" that could truly enrich her life."
1,Oh Please...,"This book is so unabashedly poor-me drivel that I can't believe it was published. I loaned it to a writer friend of mine, and she is of the same sentiment. Motherhood does not need to be this melodramatic, this difficult. Oh please."
4,Life Goes On,"When I first read this book, I found the moments with the author's cancer ridden friend to be somewhat off joint with the story of raising a child as a former alcoholic. But the point of the story really isn't about the author or even about the child, but rather about how one manages one's life (the ups and downs) as one takes on this new responsibility. And this is sadly, where the book misses somewhat. We find out Ms. Lamott's friend passes away and there is where the story should begin. How do you deal with the passing of a close friend when you have such a demanding presence in your life who doesn't understand your grief? As someone who has gone through this, I was sorry to see the story end the way it did. The accounts though are well realized and very funny. I can't say I agree with some of the other reviewers that this isn't something expecting mothers should read, but I think that it is more suited for the mother who has been through the experience of raising the one year old."
2,"Been there, done that.","The book invokes memories of my own child rearing experiences and emotions. Having said that, it's like being at a gathering of women talking about their labor struggles. Why do we think anyone cares?"
2,Not appropriate for all audiences...,"I bought this book for my granddaughter who had just had her first child. I know Anne Lamott to be a bit radical in her writings, however, I thought that while recording the life journey of her child she might be a bit less crude. Not true as she begins by making refernce to his maturing genitals through the years. Not appropriate for the mother of newborn son, at least in my opinion. There seems to be enough crude language and displays without including it in a record of your son's first year ot life."
2,"was recommended to me, but I didn't particularly like this book","It might have been too high of expectations on my part - since a friend recommended it - she thought it was hilarious, but I simply did not enjoy this book. It was kind of boring and repetitive of other books on the same themes."
5,Terrific!,"This is the funniest book I've ever read, and I've read a lot. Many times, I have purchased and given this book away as a gift. One line from the book has resounded through my head for years, now: ""You don't have that kind of time,"" spoken by Anne Lamott's dear friend, terminally ill with cancer at the time, when Lamott asked her if she thought the outfit she was trying on made her look fat. It's a book that sticks with you. I highly recommend it."
4,For those who are expecting... an unexpected treat,"My mother gave me this book recently, when I learned I was pregnant. I really enjoyed it, although some parts of it alarmed me (especially Lamott's description of her baby's months of colicky, sleepless nights).(...) She is unflinchingly honest about both the highs and lows of motherhood. There's nothing sentimental or sappy about this book, yet she makes it clear that she considers her (unplanned) pregnancy to be the greatest blessing of her life. It made me more excited about having my baby... and reassured me that even oddballs like myself can make good mothers.I don't think you have to be a mother or mom-to-be to enjoy this book, but it probably helps. And it's definitely not a good choice if you're at all prudish or conservative. Otherwise, though-- highly recommended. Guaranteed to bring you lots of laughs and a least one good cry."
4,Must read for new mothers,For all the mothers that desparately love their baby that drives them crazy. Just the right dose of reality and religion.
3,"nice shoe, but not true to size","The shoe is nicely made, light and dressy, but too narrow.My husband has standart 7.5M and the shoes were too tight so we had to return them."
5,trans-dapt chrome water pump pulley,nice product at about a 20% savings over local retailers - solid construction - should last for years to come - recommended
5,Tough Love - Help for the family,Very Good. It is about the work of a group called Palmer Drug Abuse Program and the work they do with the whole family. I wish there were more groups like this.
1,Hilariously Melodramatic,"The only thing this book is good for is getting high with your friends then reading the dialogue aloud. The thought that anyone actually believes or takes the ""situations"" in this crap serious is so befuddling it's scary. This is nothing more than propaganda for some strange religious cult. I don't know about you but if I'm going to buy a book to help me with my kids it's going to be by an expert, not some failed fiction writer."
4,Good book,"This is a good book for a rainy day, because it is a lot to absorb. But I really like this book. I actually bought it because of all the negative reviews - I wanted to see what all the hooplah was about. It has many interesting theories - and you do not HAVE to believe all of them - but they all deserve consideration."
5,The ultimate compendium for rational readers,"This is a lively, opinionated, common-sense book debunking myths, hoaxes, superstitions, pseudoscience, the occult and more. Fun to read, too."
4,Intriguing collection,I always use urban myths in my storylines so this book was an interesting read and as all reference books are you take what you will and believe what your choose.More things are unknown than known.And that should always be the case.
2,Cynic more than Skeptic,"It's always a treat to read a writer who engages in what he purports to refute. One other review on this site gave Carroll's book five stars for, in part, ""not too much depth."" No argument there. Depth seems a prerequisite to skepticism. So Carroll's credibility regarding such matters as Carl Jung's contributions to psychology is, as revealed by both his tone and his thin and selective support, reveal a writer in way over his head.In all, the work (like the website), reads more like a set of fundamentalist sermons warning congregations against temptations of the flesh than a demonstration of intellectual rigor. Merely claiming to be skeptical doesn't make one so.Ironically, this is a good book for learning how to be a skeptic in the same way that a book by Rush Limbaugh is a good way to learn how to be a leftist.The two stars are for: 1) Some laughs; 2) An engaging list of topics; 3) Occasional lucidity."
2,The Skeptic's Dictionary,"The main thing wrong with this book is that some of the sections are nothing more than uninformed personal opinion. There are some items that he is knowledgeable of, but this quality of his commentary is not consistent, and when he finds something he feels strongly against, he gives a rant that is no better -and in some cases a lot worse- than the ideas he is writing against. He writes like a university professor, which is to say that his style is quasi-polished and packed with arctypes of ideology, some of which are themselves pseudo-whatever. When those are right, then his arguments are correct; but when they are untrue or incorrect, he simply doesn't seem to notice that they are untrue or incorrect. For this reason the book is suspect overall. If there's something you know is true, maybe you will find reinforcement of that fact here; but if there is something that you are not sure about, this book is not the one to trust in finding out what the objective truth is."
1,Treat with the utmost skepticism!,"If you wanted to teach someone to think for themself, would you:A) Teach them to think concisely and rationally, how to carry out meaningful investigations, and how to keep an open mind till they had sufficient evidence to make their OWN evaluation, pro or con, on a given subject?B) Or would you tell them what to think, implying that they were some kind of gullible fool if they disagreed with YOUR evaluations?If you said ""A"", well done, there's hope for you yet.If you said ""B"", you'll probably love this book ..."
1,Disappointing if not deceiving,"At first I was glad to be able to read this book on various subjects. But then, I began to notice in a few subjects where I do have some knowledge, that the author conveniently skipped the information that could vaguely contradict him. And then I saw a couple of times where the author speaks in derogatory terms of things he visibly has no direct experience of. I feel almost deceived by this work. I am really angry. (I won't tell what info and where; I just give my opinion, I am not the skeptic of the skeptic's dictionary.)"
3,"Good, but not that much better than the website","There is no review I could write for this book that would be as good as simply directing you to the books parent website, [...]. If you've read the site, then you know what to get from the book; a listing of various pseudoscience, religous and just plain 'out there' beliefs with short essays about why they are bunk.The problem in the book lay in the fact that it simply isn't that much better than the website, making it difficult for me to recommend that anyone buy it when the site is free.Still, if you want something you can take on the road with you, or something that you can bring to your 'true believer' friends' house, or if for some reason you would rather read a book than look at a computer monitor, then go ahead and buy it...if you liked the site, you'll like the book."
1,About the author,I was actually thinking about buying this book; until I saw the authors childish and very rude remarks to customers that have bought his book and replyed to it. Do not support this A hole!! Look for someone else. This man does not deserve your hard earned money!. See for youeselfs. skepdic.com
2,Another waste of money,"The film dragged too long and failed to show many of Henri Rousseau's paintings. The penguin would just keep talking on and on, and I found the film very boring to watch. One of the paintings, entitled A Carnival Evening, is familiar to me because it is found at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Meanwhile, Dropping in on Rousseau is really a waste of time."
5,The Real China,"This book, along with ""Wild Swans"", is a must read for anyone who would understand the history of China and why things are the way they are. It is well written and fast paced. The corruption of Chiang Kai-shek before Mao took over was enlightening. The media gives such a biased (pro-American) and simplistic (black and white) view of events in China. This book will take you behind the scenes."
3,Journalists Report from China in WW2,"This is investigative journalism at its best, starting in 1939 with a report of the then Kuomintang capital and ending with the renewed civil war well under way in 1946, the years this book was published in the present, unchanged form. All important historical event in this time bracket are treated as they were realized by the authors based on their investigations and understanding of China - but to many questions of personal motives or details answers then couldn't be presented. The hero of the story is the Chinese peasant and the more efficient way to help him to progress into the modern world is seen with the communists. But it is not the complete history of China between 1937 and 1949 I hoped to find ...."
4,China in the years immediately prior to Communism,"I read this book for my Chinese history seminar and there's no denying that it provides valuable insight into turmoil in which China became embroiled during the Second World War. But there were several occassions when White's writing briefly degenerated into that of a hoaky hack-journalist, which marred what was essentially a very interesting book."
4,Works,"Took it on a 3 day trip to St. Louis via train. Fit for carry on, seems durable no problems yet, holds my stuff. Only complaint is that the shoulder strap can get uncomfortable even after a few minutes if it is loaded up."
3,Bulkier Than It Appears,"The wallet was well made and pretty, but I didn't realize it would be so bulky. The double card section, when filled with my ID cards, was akward to hold. So I returned it. If you are accustomed to carrying a large amount of ""stuff"" in your wallet, you probably wouldn't mind this one, but for me just too big to handle."
2,Definitely not for beginners!,"Agree wholeheartedly with previous reviewer. The book is occasionally useful as a reference once you have a good grasp of the subject matter, but DO NOT buy it as a learning tool!"
4,Nice ring!,"Very nice ring. It does look a bit like the picture on the webpage. The amethyst is not shiny, but a dark purple. The silver ring is nice quality. However, I don't think all sizes are the same, I ordered 2 rings at size 5, and I do notice that they're different, one is looser than the other."
5,Always surprised!,"Every time I listen to this group, I am always surprised by beautiful harmony between the women and the wonderful background music. I have heard Amazing Grace sung in Cherokee, but by a group of Navajo on the reservation. But there is no comparison and it is hard to imagine any better rendition."
4,walala,I realy loved this cd.It touched a part of me.I found it by accident and I'm glad that I did.I enjoyed it very much and I think you will to. Especially the mountain song at the end.
5,Spirit-filled music!,"A pleasant surprise, this melodic, restful and yet inspiring cd was well thought out! If you have never heard 'Amazing Grace' sung in Cherokee, with bagpipes (Scottish heritage!)along with some of the most beautiful women's voices - you are in for an experience, you'll listen to it over and over and over!Even my hard-core 'country western' son was inspired after hearing it in the background of a travel video we made while traveling in our truck with the cd player on- of course! This cd earns it's wings...."
5,A work of art & a major stress breaker,"I thought I'd lost Rita Coolidge, and then one day I walked into a Reservation gift shop and found this fabulous recording. Her voice is mesmerizing. It moves me to a place where everything is peaceful, as her voice always has. You can't beat the genetic harmony you'll find here either. I'm thrilled that her sister and niece are also on the album with her. There's even one with their mother--all of the Cherokee nation. I hope we hear more from them. 'Can't say enough good about this album. Anyone ever heard Priscilla's old records when she was married to Booker T. Jones. Kicks. Anyway, buy Walela. The best stress breaker I've found in a long time."
3,Very good,"Some of the songs on this CD are a bit not so good, but some are very good. We bought it for AMazing Grace in Cherokee, which is excellent."
5,"Wonderfully moving, lyrical, musically exciting","As a new fan of contemporary Native American music (or as Robert Mirabal (Taos Pueblo) calls it, ""Alter-Native"" music) I keep exploring the various groups, seeing musicians like Douglas Spotted Eagle go from traditional to Contemporary to New Age, and while it's interesting to ""hear"" a journey like that, what is really exciting and meaningful is to hear a group like this take traditional music and if it is possible, keep the traditions but make it contemporary as well --- Walela's wonderful harmonies, moving lyrics and truly beautiful music makes this CD my favorite!"
4,Good complement,My main guide book for a recent Rome trip was Rick Steves'. But the irreverent guide offered some additional info and provided some chuckles as well. I recommend it.
2,great for before the trip - not so good during,"The book gives you a nice overview of the atmosphere etc. that makes it a fun read as you anticipate the trip. However the maps that I tried to use in Rome, were off by a few blocks each time - only a problem when you didn't have another source of information. This is a book that I'd suggest as your 3rd or 4th one to get - not the first one."
4,Excelent for Americans,"Books has great tips and using it along with a more ""traditional"" guide is a great combination !Particulary good on the restaurant tips.A litle ""too"" focused on americans visiting Italy but ok."
4,LP Caliente bongos,"this product is my favorite instrument. I'm always practicing on my first bongos. It's ""muy caliente""!"
5,A Real Gem,"If you love improvisation, this is the movie for you. The king of improv, Jonathon Winters, is at his comedic best as he moves from one hysterical situation to the next. You never know how he is going to react to the situation, and I believe that he doesn't either. Many actors provide cameo appearences. Howie Mandel in the grocery store is wonderful, as his his scene with Robin Williams. All in all, a very funny movie."
5,Certifiable Genius,"Jonathan Winter's comedic genius is still timely and seemingly effortless! Winters was nearly 80 when this film was shot a few years ago, but with his quick wit, sharp timing and frequently funny sound effects you'd never know it. A tremendous talent, Winters embarks on his second career as an artist with the hopes of showing his paintings in the MOMA. Hilariously funny clips of Winters with pals Robin Williams, Howie Mandel and Sarah Silverman sprinkled throughout the film along with black and white clips from Winters' talk show appearances propel this film's journey. Entertaining as always, Winters and his friends (also included: the entire Arquette clan & Jimmy Kimmel) make this an enjoyable film for all audiences young and old."
2,Go elswhere for your Jonathan Winters fix,"A painfully bad, unfunny, artless ""mockumentary"" starring Jonathan Winters. What a missed opportunity. A real documentary about Winters would have been amazing. You see flashes of what could have been -- moments of great humor whenever Jonathan is allowed to riff free and loose and be real. But the fake story about Winters trying to get into the Museum of Modern Art and suffering after a painting of his is stolen (he's really a fantastic artist) is both unconvincing and devoid of humor. Robin Williams livens things up a bit once or twice. There's a decent scene of Winters and Howie Mandell shopping in Target looking for where they can buy ""funny,"" and the scene where Winters tries to hire a hitman to recover his lost sense of humor almost achieves something, but the rest is awful. I kept watching for glimpses of Winters being Winters, which you get, but I definitely don't recommend this film. Try Winters' other DVDs or albums instead."
4,Glad to See This is Still Available,"Worthwhile just for Little Niles. Limehouse, Jitterbug Waltz, etc. also really fine."
2,Not a Good Pick for Classical Music Lovers,"This Pyle Pro cassette deck is reasonably priced, and might be great for low fidelity uses, but was not a good choice for me. Since this deck has no ""Dolby"" feature, my classical music came out sounding flat and tinny. In addition, there was a lot of ""hissing"" from surface noise. Since I have top-of-the line speakers, and a Denon amp, I'm used to hearing near ""concert hall"" reproduction of my music. However, this Pyle Pro deck obviously wasn't made for that type of use. So, I ended up returning it, and going back to an all-Denon sound system, which is the best I've ever heard. If you want cassettes to play with nearly the same clarity as CD's, I would NOT recommend the Pyle Pro."
1,Cult rock,"This is the manic ramblings and sonic nonsense of the late Wulf Zendik. Zendik Inc. and much of their 'art' is so bad, so unpolished and malformed, as to be found under the rubric of 'dada'. Avoid these people and their tripe at all costs."
1,HORRIBLE book,"I read this book about a decade ago, and it says a lot that after nine or ten years, I'm still filled with revulsion at the thought of it. The entire first third of the book is about a woman being enslaved and tortured psychologically in horrifying ways, and there is not a hint of hope in it until halfway through. And even after that, all the main character can seem to do is angst about how miserable she'd been in the first half of the book! I have no idea why I finished it -- oh, wait, yes I do, I was on a ten-hour flight and had nothing else to do -- but I wish I'd never picked it up in the first place. Avoid this book like the plague."
1,Not so good,"I actually went looking here, for this book, so that I could warn people off. What a tremendous let-down, to come out of such an interesting premise! The writing, oh, the writing! I have been afraid, since reading this book, to pick up any book with a similar title. If you like action and suspense, and plot twists, fine. Want quality prose? Look elsewhere."
2,"Very medically and gynecologically oriented, more for outpatients","Nov 23, 2007: Sample scripts stress medical and gynecological outpatient clinic problems. Not enough to help you with surgical consent forms, descriptions of operations and risks, anesthesia procedures, home care issues, but bettter than a general dictionary."
5,Great for the professional!,This is a very helpful dictionary especially for the professional who depends on accuracy in translating or interpreting from one language toanother.
4,Wonderful dictionary for work and leisure,"Hola,Este mensaje es para aquellos que trabajan en la rama de la medicina como tambien para padres de familia que desean continuar su educacion. Trabajando como interprete en la rama medica encuentro ese diccionario muy util. Muchas veces me a salvado en emergencia. Lo considero un libro que te ayuda a refrescar la memoria con terminologia ademas de ayudarte facilmente a manipular con la ayuda de dibujos e incluye un cd que tiene mucha informacion que puedes cargar en el celular y directo en la cartera muy facilmente. Es uno de mis libros favoritos y se lo recomiendo a muchos.Myriam K. M"
5,A great resource for healthcare in Central America,"We used this book on a medical trip to Guatemala, and it was great. Easy to access what we needed and very complete. It is a trifle pricey, but we bought another copy to leave with the group in Guatemala."
5,awesome awesome awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"you'll be singing and dancing in your car and will be brought to tears as well. this man is THE singer of this generation. he has a jazz voice with a multi-octave range; however the music he does is more funk-rock, r&b and ballad."
2,Heavy,I bought this for backpacking thinking it looked like a nice set that was easy to store. It is very heavy and when the pans store in themselves they hit each other while you walk and make you sound like a marching band. So if you are going backpacking to break your back and scare away nature this is the perfect product.
3,Okay compliation,"This is a okay compliation. Its under 20 dollars, so the price is right for 2 discs. It has many of Zepplin's greatest hits in a affordable package spanning over their entire career. Also, the cds are enhanced cds and contain music videos of ""commuication breakdown"" and ""kashmir"".It would have been better if a third disc was added which contained 9-10 more songs though."
4,Pretty Nice Collection,I bought this collection being a so-so Led Zepplin fan and still love it. I mean this might not be the collection for huge fans but fans who just hear some of there songs on the Radio here and there preety much all the popular ones are here.So no let downs for Casual Fans.
4,Good.,Good colection of songs from the greatest band that ever lived. This is a prety good selection of songs although there alot of Zeppelins best songs that are missing. Still it is worth the money.
4,23 of their best songs.,"""Led Zeppelin"" has numerous classic albums, and a few boxsets out, but this is actually the closest thing they have to a ""Greatest Hits"". Them being one of the best rock n' roll bands in history, means this is obviously the tip of the iceberg, but it's still a good introduction. Many of their best songs are included, like ""Whole Lotta Love"", ""Immigrant Song"", ""Kashmir"", and the infamous ""Stairway To Heaven"". Plus other favorites like ""Dazed And Confused"", ""Black Dog"", and ""All My Love"". So if you're looking for a 2-disc ""Best Of"", this is about it. It'll go great with your ""Black Sabbath"" and ""Who"" collections."
5,what this set did for me!,"I couldn't argue with those who find fault with this set, as those people make very good points against buying this. However, having bought this set before any of their other CDs (except ZOSO), I can say that this did for me exactly what Jimmy Page knew that it would: It made me want more Zeppelin! I went from these to both Box Sets, and from there to purchasing all the single album CDs.So, is this set part of a plan to 'trap' people into becoming fanatics? Maybe not, but that's how it worked out for me. I hardly ever pull out these disks now to listen to Zep, but they served their purpose and I'm glad that I bought them! I dare anyone who is new to Zep to buy these and NOT want more of them! Zeppelin is the BEST!!!"
5,"Early Days, Better Days","Was impressed with the album. Was missing a few songs that I really wanted, but over all, it was worth my money."
5,Classic Rock at its best,"I bought this album a while ago and I'm hooked. I initially bought for the early stuff, half thinking I would leave neglected the Latter days cd. How wrong I was. Each era is as good as each another. Die hard fans should be concentrating on what's on this compilation rather than what isn't. Pump yourself full of the Led!! A great introduction to the definitive rock band of all time."
3,sold out before I got it,"I tried to obtain this cd, but they sold out of it. I do give high marks for the fast reverse on my credit card that was billed. I rec'd my credit the next day. I would try to buy from this seller again."
1,Horrible,I know Led Zeppelin rocks and I was trying toget into them so I bought this CD. It is horrible!! There are like 2 good songs the rest of it is all slow and lame!!
1,Pretty unoriginal,"Hmmmm. . .power trio plus one, blond lead singer, loud and crazy drummer, guitarist who was the brains behind the group. . .all I have to say is, if these guys weren't paying royalties to the Who, they should be.Long-winded collection featuring trademark Zeppelin: by trademark, I mean shreiking vocals and half-decent riffs. If that appeals to you, go right ahead."
1,Embarassment to Music,"I can not express how horrible this CD is. It is by far the worst Cd by the worst band I have ever heard. There is no melody or any tunes to any of the songs. Listening to this CD really makes me wanna kill myself. The guitar solos are horrible and every song is the exact same. People that listen to this CD need to get out of the 70s or whenever this band was actually popular and listen to some good music that people have actually heard of. It's 2004 people! What I really can't stand is all of the young, high school people that listen to Led Zepplin because they think it is cool. Ok, maybe clothes from the 70s are in, but music isn't. Listening to old music won't make you original and cool, everybody knows that you don't really like it, so just give up the act."
3,"Good Compilation, But Songs Are Missing","Well, let me start off by saying I am a huge Led Zeppelin fan. I own all of their CD'S (even ""Presence"" and ""Coda""), but this ""Best Of"" compilation should've been called ""The Most Popular Of Led Zeppelin"", because all of the songs on this CD are their songs that have the most radio-play (""Stairway To Heaven"" anyone?). I'm not saying that these songs are bad, but so much good music was left out. Why is it that the second CD only has ten songs? ""Ramble On"", ""Fool In The Rain"", ""Hey Hey What Should I Do Now?"" and ""Misty Mountain Hop"" are some of their best material, yet it wasn't put on the CD. I really wished that ""Hey Hey What Should I Do?"" was released, due to the fact that it was never released before. Overall, the CD has some of the greatest rock songs of all-time on it (highlights are ""Stairway To Heaven"", ""When The Levee Breaks"", ""Kashmire"" and ""All My Love""), it's just a shame that so many songs didn'tget included."
4,Consider the other work.,"I'm not that old (I mean, like high school), so only recently in the past few years did I get into Led Zeppelin. It was always played around in my house when I was young. I grew up to Stairway to Heaven. I believe this is a good album to own if you're looking for a good start to Zeppelin and want a good deal. If you are a really serious listener, get all the albums, even LPs if you can (vinyl is great). This album consists of several of their greatest works but lacks many songs. It's not a bad album (how can you have a bad Led Zeppelin album?)the music is great, but it could be better with the selection.Led Zeppelin is one of the greatest bands. Music apparently turned for the worse in the 21st century. The crap that is on these days is SO bad. It's unbelievable the crap people will listen to. Get away from all that rap and awful pop music and listen to one of the greatest bands...ever."
2,this compilation sucks!,"led zeppelin is the second greatest musical artists ever behind beatles, but this collection is horrible.these are led zeppelin's greatest songs:good times, ramble on, whole lotta love, immigrant song, rock and roll, black dog, goin to california, stairway to heaven, misty mountain, the ocean, dancin days, over the hills, dyer mker, kashmir, all my love.as you can see all the best songs from houses of the holy album are missing, why? the two best albums- houses and 4 are missing songs here, but i can accept two missing songs out of five for an album- but 4 out of 4! that's asking for trouble"
5,A wonderful compilation for a wonderful band.,"Led Zeppelin were the fathers of heavy metal. Their debut was before Black Sabbath's, so therefore they are metal's fathers. But as they grew more and more popular, they became more and more commercial, so that is why CD 1, Early Days is better than CD 2, Latter Days. On disc one, all their crunch-rock metallic epics are showcased (okay, almost all of them), beginning with the unbelievably heavy Good Times, Bad Times, and ending with the hackneyed, but still wonderful Stairway To Heaven. Disc Two pretty much does all their more commercial songs like Houses of the Holy and In the Evening. Anyone who says zeppelin was not a metal band, but a claasic rock one must listen to Dazed and Confused. Happy headbanging!"
3,Later Man,"Don't get me wrong. Every tune on these cd's are proven but the Early Years left out a few tunes and caused me to buy at least ZOSO(IV)and I did get Houses of The Holy but not because disk 2 suffers from lesser hits, Disk #2, the Later Years, is a great-great addition to anyone's collection plus it features a video on Kashmir. Led Zeppelin is one of the few top-ten rock bands I never get tired of. If you don't have any LZ this disk set will make you appreciate the craft of rock and blues. Buy this before it vanishes."
1,Don't expect too much.,"In theory, this is a good product but putting it to use you will discover that it is not all it is cracked up to be. My phone did not fit very well into the holder even though it is the correct model. I found myself constantly checking to make sure it was still in there and did not fall out. After about two days of use, one of the bottom holders broke rendering the holder useless. But, it was cheap so I am not real disappointed."
3,Pendant review,"This is a pretty little necklace. One problem, however, is how the chain attaches to the pendant. If the pendant falls off, it is difficult to loop the chain through the oddly placed holes. Now, it may be easier to do with younger eyes and hands that don't shake with close work, but I certainly had problems. Otherwise, the necklace is attractive and gets lots of compliments."
2,Not what I expected at all.,The service was great on time but the can holder wasn't at all what I expected. Was thin and cheap.
3,Just okay for me,"I will preface my review by saying that I use this can holder primarily at our community pool. So, once the cold can is removed from my cooler and put into the Coleman can holder it doesn't take too long before my soda is warm. I wouldn't expect it to keep my drink cold for hours, but I would say...about 5-10 minutes of cooling is all I can count on. Maybe, used in a different/cooler environment it would perform better. I should have just spent the additional money on the one that's metal and about $10 more, for use at the pool. If you are really looking to keep drinks cold in warmer environments, I would pass on this one and get the more expensive metal one."
5,Exactly what I aw looking for in a coozie,The perfect coozie. I looked all over the local stores to no avail. These came up on my first search. Great product keeps my drinks cold and easy to get can in and out
3,it sweats,"I've been using the can holder for a month now, and although I love the fact that cans are easy to insert and remove, the can holder sweats so it is very slippery. I would not buy again."
5,cost,"what are you trying to do get rich, selling a coleman can holder for $41.00 i never saw anything so crazy."
3,veet WHY?,Our local stores stopped selling Veet and when I tried to purchase it online what I recieved was disappointing. It was winter and im thinking that the product being in the cold weather made it unproductive.
2,defective product,"I have used this product many times over the last couple of years. However, the two boxes I purchased were defective and did not peel apart properly and stuck to my skin. It took two to three times the number of strips to do the job. I hope this was an isolated incident as I do enjoy the convenience of waxing at home."
3,Be careful if you have sensitive skin!!,"I got this product as a promotion attached to a bottle of Veet. I decided to try it on my face, and while it did remove a lot of the hair...it also caused my skin to peel really badly the next day (and for several days afterwards, which is fairly embarrasing when it's on your face). In case you're wondering, yes, I did try it on another area of skin first to be sure I wouldn't be allergic to it as per the package directions. I guess the bottom line is: If you have sensitive skin, be very careful when using this product!"
1,Aweful!,"It does not work at all. The sheets of wax were so thick and so brittle that it seemed like the product was way passed its expiration date ( not sure if wax has that).I do not recommend it at all. For that price you can get a much product from your local drug store,I still have the unused part and it is so bad!"
2,Good if u have long hair to remove,Only takes half the hair nads works better too bad its so messy. This product is easy to use and would probably work if u hadent shaved or waxed in forever.
1,What a waste!,I shouldn't have wasted money on this crap. This particular Veet wax strips is ineffective. I have tried using other Veet wax strips for the legs and they work well but not this one. This is useless.
3,Eh,"It wasn't that great. Nasty stickiness afterwards no matter how careful I was, but for the cheapness of the item and the lil patches of hair i wanted out it was ok."
2,Disappointed,"I was really looking forward to this product because of all the good reviews, but it didn't meet the hype. I have very thick curly hair and have had lots of trouble finding wax strips that work for me, but for some reason I thought this was it. It only removed about 60% of the hair from my underarms, and that was after going over them twice. I guess the search continues."
1,stay away,"I followed the instructions exactly and it did not work. I tried it three separate times before I could get it to remove any hair, and it did not remove nearly as much as it should have. It pulled out maybe 10 single hairs and left a thick, sticky, wax residue on my leg that didn't even come off in a hot shower. I had to SCRUB and SCRUB! Shaving is easier than this! Stay away from this product. You are better off using Nair or getting a professional waxing. SUPER DISAPPOINTED!"
1,Lots of errors,"This book is out of print now and for a very good reason, besides the age of the 68HC11 o course. It is filled with errors. I had to use this book back in college and the only redeeming value this book had was a table of assembly language commands that actually was right (which is why the prof used the book). Don't trust any of the examples in this book because most of them are wrong."
5,This book rocks!,"This is the most helpful book on writing that I've ever read. Period. Every time I read through it again, or page through to reread my highlighted sections, I'm amazed by the mixture of common sense, insight, alacrity and experience that fill every page.Noble's secrets on subtly and misdirection, finding ways to let scenes, storylines, and themes converge, and insights on character development, transitions, and story structure will improve the work of any author. Guaranteed.Whether you write for a living or as a hobby, your library of writing resources will never be complete without a copy of ""Conflict, Action & Suspense."" Highly recommended."
4,"Conflict, Action & Suspence",This book is very helpful. There is much information which I had not thought of before. I think I will be reading it more than once.
4,An aspiring writer,"I was hesitant to read this book after reading some of the reviews, but I decided to give it a try anyway. I was pleasantly surprised and found that it was actually a very helpful book and I learned several techniques. I would definetely recommend this book and I plan to read other books by Noble."
1,"A Good Magazine Article Turned Into a Slow, Boring Book","I can't believe a book about suspense, action and conflict could be so dull. Rambling, unfocused, going in circles, etc."
2,"Decent, but Forgettable","i>Conflict, Action, and Suspense struck me as a mostly forgettable book. That's not necessarily bad - I mean, the book wasn't so awful that I remember it for all the wrong reasons - but the advice felt pretty generic. It's the sort of thing that's great if you really haven't read another book on writing, but which is pretty useless if you have.I'd imagine that this book might be useful for a very beginning author who is working on developing these conflict, action, and suspense, but there are almost certainly better books on these three things out there."
1,Another Shot,"I wrote a bad review for Threelac originally. At the time I took it for only 3 weeks, however I did end up taking the whole box, as well as the Oxygen Elements recommended with it. Still I have no good results. I still suffer daily with Candida, and after more research I havent found any product that has such good reviews as Threelac, so I'm going to try it a second time. This time I guess I'll have to up the dosage. I'll review again and let you know if it works or not."
2,Eh...,"Well, usually I love remix albums, EPs, and such, but I have to say that this one just doesn't quite cut it. I'd rather have the plain, old Rosemary Clooney version any day--it has more fire. Besides, it seems these guys are just jumping onto the Mambo bandwagon clinging onto the flash in the pan coattails of Lou Bega."
3,Love this,"I love this protein, it tastes great and it's great to replace a meal. The only problem I have is the container is HALF FULL, I've ordered this twice and thought it was just a mistake the first time. I ordered the protein again and the container is literally half empty. I share this with my son and by a week and a half it's done!!! I don't appreciate spending $$$ and getting only half a container!!!"
5,BEST PROTEIN,"This is the best known quality protein for athletic training use that I am aware of and is priced very good at Amazon.It is shown to be manufactured in a certified G.M.P. and F.D.A. facility.With the whey protein being 100% hydrolized,once consumed,it is delivered very quickly and effectivly to build muscle mass and strength.It's best taken immediatly before or after training."
1,Like Muscle Milk Better,"I tried the dymatize nutrition whey chocolate as a replacement to my muscle milk chocolate, I was not at all happy with the switch, the dymatize was more chalky and powder tasting and it certainly did not have the sweet chocolate taste as the muscle milk does, I will be using muscle milk again next time."
2,smells and tastes terribly off,"When I first opened the bottle, I swear it smelled similar to spoiled milk. I don't know if the company sent me an expired product or it spoiled in transit due to the heat (can't find expiration date on it), but the diarrhea from drinking it is kind of tolerable."
5,Great,This protein powder does not taste as disgusting as most others. It actually has a good taste and I noticed a difference in the way it helped me tone! Very filling as well!
4,"best bang for the buck, in my opinion","I have tried most of all the major brands and I like this best.No GasNo CrampingMixes VERY easily in a shaker with water aloneNo aftertastevery inexpensive price when you buy 5Lbs from Amazon.Chocolate is my fave. But, the fruit is nice too.The other dymatize I have tried is the Elite Gourmet, which is a blended Whey and not a true Hydrolized Isolate.When I switched from Blended Whey to a 100% Isolate I immediately noticed less water retention, quicker muscle pump, and more noticeable energy during high intensity, when drinking pre AND post workout. . .My results may not be typical, however, I am noting it since this is markedly different than what I noticed from Muscle Milk, ON, EAS, and Gaspari."
1,BLOATING AND REACTION,"I USED this product for a while and it seemed fine. Then i began to feel and look bloated continuously. After talking to my doctor he said my body did not react well to this product. The company i purchased from said they would be glad to give me a refund if I returned it. I had already paid shipping and now another 12.00 to return it. I called Dymatize and they said they would give me a credit on their web site. Since I can use nothing they sell they basically said thats just tough. I would think a company would be more gracious but, they certainly were not. There are many other good products on the market and my suggestion is to choose one not made by DYMATIZE"
4,Gives me what I need,"The base of it is protein and only 1 gram of carbohydrates, which is exactly what I need as far as basing it off of my nutritional diet.I would recommend."
5,Will never buy any other protein again.,"I've been working out for years but always seemed to go for the cheaper protein. I recently settled upon BSN Syntha-6 because it tasted so good... the problem is that it's not a very clean protein at all.I finally decided to try a 100% Whey Isolate and ordered the ISO100. I'm blown away. It tastes amazing even in water (which is a benchmark for protein taste; if it tastes good in just water, then it's awesome) and mixes easily without power tools.It also doesn't give me any stomach discomfort like those that contain lesser proteins."
3,It's alright,"Dymatize iso-100 protein isolate is an ok product. I don't know if the vanilla version of this tastes any batter but the tast of this protein powder isn't great. I like that it is almost 90% pure protein by weight and that it has some BCAA's and glutamine. The cookie bits are too hard to bite, it's almost like you're biting little rocks.Overall, It's just an average product."
5,Great Protein Shake,The shipping on this item was very quick. I use the whey isolate protein from Dymatize and I like the Berry Blast flavor. This was my first time trying this and it was very good. The flavors are similar and both taste good.
3,Nice protein but...,"Contains Soy GM (genetically modified). Found out after i bought it :l, i was looking for GM product free but taste well if you dont care about that."
5,Quality Protein,"Thought I would put my review here since there was only one. I buy this about every month to every other month and have had only good experiences. I get it because I'm celiac and it's gluten free, but the chocolate flavor taste really good in my opinion."
4,"Grrrrreat, but ...!","Great taste. Pleasant smell. Dissolves nicely. Digests quickly. An impressive nutrition profile (have a look). Decent gains after 1 month of use. An excellent product that i wish i could continue buying. Lol! Unfortunately, too sweet and too expensive. Too expensive!Did i say too expensive already?"
4,"Eliane Elias' ""Sleigh Ride"" is fantastic!","Get this CD just to listen to Eliane Elias' ""Sleigh Ride."" The other tracks are also great, but I keep listening to this one over and over."
5,Useful,"I bought it for camping that never happened...now I'm using it in my kitchen, because it's really great.I would buy it again."
5,Awesome!,"Love this pot. Perfect size and durable. My wife and I boiled all of our meals and even made jello in this pot, set it aside over a few hours in the cold and it was great!"
2,Not what I thought I was buying,"Not what I expected. The image shows several pots, You only get one 1.6L pot. I will say the quality of the single pot is very good and works well.. But, this is not a set as it appears."
2,misleading images...,"I, like the other reviewer, thought I was getting a set based on the description ""Alpine Stowaway POTS"" and the photo which shows multiple pots. It does appear to be of nice quality but for our occasional car camping I don't think I'd invest in this whole set."
3,a little pricey,"well what can i say here, it is a great quality piece but the pricing puts it on par with all-clad or some other high end at home cookware. i like the pot and i use it but honestly for the price i could have gotten a nice 1 liter stainless pot anywhere and it would have worked just fine.seriously, it is only a liter...you are a little ""proud"" of it..."
3,Beware! These do NOT nest!,be careful when ordering if one of your aims w/this line of cookware is to have nesting capability...you will need to order a small and then two-step larger size in order to nest two of these pots...the 475 will fit into the 1.1 thoughwhy MSR chose to spec a Thai-made stainless design like this is beyond me
5,Great Pot!,"This thing is AWESOME! Super durable.I've used this on several trips now and have yet to have an issue with it. I typically pack it with 2x Ramen Noodles, a bottle of Mio, a pack of noodles (put ""Lipton Sides"" in the search Bar), and a few protein bars. It's a tight fit, but it's handy.I treat it like I've borrowed it from my worst enemy and it still looks great."
4,Interesting flick for a few reasons,"This movie has Boris Karloff and Lionell Barrymore (He's the villian in It's a Wonderfull Life Christmas story staring James Stewart. Barrymore is the other banker)Neat to see these two actors in a silent together.A bit of a twist I did not expect here and I wont give it away. Do NOT read the jacket or it will spoil the twist. I make it a standing rule to not read the jackets before i watch a movie for this reason. They all too often give away important parts of the movie.This had a sort of Dostoyevsky (Crime and Punishment) sort of flavour to the movie, though I wont tell you how it got there.Neat movie and had a interesting spiritual end.glad to have it in my silents collection."
3,"Great concept, Quality could improve",Great concept. I was a bit disappointed in the quality of the fabric. It feels more like something I'd buy at Target or Wal-Mart.
1,Poorly made product,"I purchased this product, and when I received it, one of the swans was already broken off in the box. Because I liked the design, I superglued it back on. Within in days, it fell off again and another one came off also. I wrote to the company and they refunded $4.00 for the broken swan, but I ended up just throwing the tray away and purchasing a different tray from a different company on Amazon. It is well-made and I really like it. I definitely would not recommend this one as it is very poorly made. The company offered to give me a full refund if I gave it a good review, but that kind of defeats the purpose of feedback, so I declined."
4,A high-quality microphone for low cost,"Not only is this the best mic i've ever used, it is unbeliveably cheap. i got this mircrophone for 60 bucks and it works like a high definition microphone as if you'd hear it a studio recorded track. The sound quality is amazing and the sensitivity is ridiculously high, which is great for people who have a studio with sound proof material surrounding it! If you don't have sound proofing and you have speakers hooked up to a mixer with the mic accompanying it, you can hear sounds within 3 rooms away (in this case, about 60 feet) with doors closed in every room. That's the only down side. If you wanted to fix this problem, simply get a mixer and turn the sensitivity down (the gain and volume knobs should control this effect). Other than the sensitivity being uncontrollable without a mixer, this product is unbelievable and i recommend getting this microphone 1000000%."
4,Not without fault. Decent for voiceover work.,"This mic is...ok. It sounds decent, as long as you have the supporting equipment. And that's the thing. You need a compressor(with gate), and a mixer, and a pre-amp. The main thing is that this is not a plug and play mic, nor is the audio exactly crystal clear. Still, for 60$, I'm pretty happy. My next mic will most likely be the Heil PR40 or the Shure SM7. You do pay for quality with equipment like this. But this is a serviceable option as a starter or backup. Also, starting with a condenser helps you train, as it will pick up mouth sounds that dynamics will ignore."
5,Best mic for the money that I've seen,"I bought this mic because my new guitar does not have a pickup and I did not want to install one in this instrument. I needed a large diaphragm condenser mic to pick up vocal and instrument. The MXL 990 does a great job. The vocals and guitar nuances are clear, and no EQ adjustment was needed. This mic reproduces the sounds as accurately as any mic I have used. Although it is advertised as a recording mic, I use it for live sound and it works fine. I also have a MXL 990 USB for recording on my laptop. I recommend this mic if you're looking for a versatile large diaphragm condenser mic and don't want to take out a second mortgage to get one. The price is great, and you get a lot of mic for the money--just as good as mics costing much more."
4,not bad at all,"you won't find better quality until you're looking to spend at least 1,000 bucks or more. this mic is worth the money."
3,Average,"I bought this mic so that I could record narrations for projects for my audio production course. I agree with other reviews that state that the sound is a bit muddy, but that's easily corrected with EQ. It's a good beginner mic, just remember to buy a pop filter for it."
4,"The holder broke, but the mic still holds up","I use this mic for everything now. I like using it for vocals because it has more depth and is less tinny than my Sm58. Of course, as a condenser, it is meant to pick up everything in the room. That just makes it great for cheap, semi-decent garage band recordings of practice with only one mic.So in the end, incredibly cheap, but better than a lot of other mics around. The hinge that holds the mic broke, which is a bummer. That's why I took away a star."
4,"Great for the price, perfect for podcasting","I have two of these because they're SO cheap and use them mainly at home if I have a musical idea. One of the reviewers above mentioned it was a bit muddy which I totally agree with. But it's incredibly cheap and fairly detailed for that amount of money. I'm curious how it will hold up over years of use. Anyway, this is probably the perfect ""step-up"" mic for podcasts if you are currently recording with your computer's built-in mic or a radio shack dynamic mic. I would choose this over the m-audio mics- it feels slightly more durable."
4,Good for the price,"i have had this microphone for almost 3 years now, and it still works well. the shock mounting has broken, but the actual microphone unit is still going strong.i am definitely not an expert in music but i do like sound. i find the highs are a little extreme and sometimes bordering on harsh in this microphone. i realise that terms like 'muddy' are somewhat open to interpretation but i have no qualms with the clarity of the midtones in recording solo vocals or acoustic instruments. as has been noted in previous reviews, this microphone requires phantom power. i'm running it through my alto s-6 mixing desk.at this price it is definitely picking up one of these microphones, i'm very happy having chosen it as my first compressor mic, but now (after almost 3 years) i think i should upgrade."
1,It doesn't work!,We can't get the microphone to work. I bought it for my son for Christmas who lives in another state. He called amazon and was told I have to call since I purchased it! He even went to Best Buy and talked to the Geek Squad to see if he needed additional equipment. We still dont' have it working!
1,Not what i expected,Its very muddy like everybody else said do like i didnt and listen 2 them this mic is very clear but ima rapper and this mic did no good for me
1,Defective,"I bought this mic, it did not work. I sent it back and got a replacement, it still did not work. That is all."
4,AWESOME MIC,This is mic is good for the price but i didnt realize that it had to have a phantom power adapter so i had to spend about 40 bucks on that and buy to more mic cords so that ended up costing me over one hundred dollars but this mic is great and looks very pro. You cant beat the price and the only problem i have with it is the you can hear everything around you when using it loud and clear. But outher than that it is the best mic i have had thus far.
2,Decent microphone for the dollar,"Too much hype here. Not as crisp and clear as some reviewers suggest.This microphone is an ok hobbyist tool. But it is anything but something to use for more than that.Notes:1) Emits a foul sharp odor that smells like burning plastic. Sometimes, makes me want to choke and cough.2) You have to direct your voice into the area above the label else it sounds ""lost""3) Has a tinge of a deep, lower bass sound from it.4) For vocals, if you have to hit a loud note, it breaks up miserably. You have to back off the mic a good 12 inches to avoid this. And it sounds really horrible.Overall a decent microphone for the price. Well built, sturdy construction. Nice extra with the shock mount. But you get what you pay for.Update 1/2/13:Backing this down to 2 stars.The shock mount screws as they sit into the shock mount ring will no longer fit as they worse out. I can no longer use the mount with a mic stand because the outer ring wore out."
2,Can't handle loud noise,"This microphone is fine for recording guitar and soft vocals. However, when I'm trying to record a grand piano or loud vocals, the microphone cilps and the sound comes out really fuzzy and distorted. I've tried standing far away from the microphone and singing loudly, but it doesn't help. If you care a lot about the quality of the vocals, or if you need to record loud sounds, I would recommend saving up for a better microphone."
1,Crap mic for ANY $$$$,"I have been an audio pro for 30+ years and this is probably the WORST sounding large diaphragm condenser mic I have ever heard at ANY price point.Harsh, hyped high end and cheap construction.Buy a Shure SM58. It's a better sounding, more rugged and better constructed mic."
3,found a cheaper one,"i wasted 20 more bucks by buying it from amazon. amazon might have amazing deals on other stuff but this mic, not so much musiciansfirends.com has them for 59 bucks.i gave it 3 stars because the mic itself is AMAZING for the price"
2,Limited Video,"These kids are limited, and so is the video: it suffers from the same problem many Christian-themed videos have, which is a lack of talent on the screen. The acting is fine for a church pageant, but not so much for a mass-marketed video. Veteran actor Bill Cobbs is an obvious talent, but no one else in the film can match him, or even comes close.The direction is limited as well, with most shots focusing on just one actor at a time, no creative approaches, very basic shots. The lighting is also often poor. This is a very low-budget film.For all that, the story itself is reasonable, and quite old-fashioned: I was reminded of the old Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland movies where the kids decided to ""put on a show!"" The plot and situations come out fine. And there's nothing especially wrong with the film. You just shouldn't buy it expecting a big-budget picture out of Hollywood."
3,Back Pain,"It worked for about 2 hours. So, this was just like tylenol to me. I think that the reason DOANS was removed from the stores, is because it wasn't effective."
2,the second half is quite good,"This is now out of print: cheap paperback editions from the 60's are now selling for forty or fifty bucks. Most of John Christopher's stuff (actual name: Samuel Youd) is for pre-teens, but this novel is for adults -- though it is a short one.This book manages to be both gripping and depressing, but it's not without its problems:1. It seems to take forever to get started.2. I would say that characterization in this novel is a minus. Christopher throws too many characters at you too fast. Since he doesn't bother to distinguish them much, it's a bit hard to tell them apart until the middle of the novel. But once the middle of the novel hits, even more come along.The one thing I liked about this novel was that our heroes, in an attempt to survive, resort to murdering innocent people using an ""either us or them"" philosophy. Since you don't see that very often in the post-Apocalyptic genre, I would recommend it in that respect."
5,Excellent Story,"This was and is a great book, and needs to be made available again.A post apocalypse classic.Doc"
4,Glad to read a classic.,"Interesting...but not what I was expecting at all, considering the premise of the book. I thought the book would be more about the circumstances that led to the premise of the story than that 85% of the book was the group traveling from London to the farm and the situations they came across along the way. And I didn't really get the end....A good read, a good story, and definitely a classic."
3,British style survivalism,Interesting book. A world-wide crop disease starves most of the world causing widespread famine and the associated breakdown in law and orders.A small band makes their way from London to a safe place in the country.It didn't go as far as I would have liked; it never showed them dealing with the challenges of maintaining their refuge.I would recommend it.John Severson
4,A Believable Ecological Disaster,"No Blade of Grass is even more timely today than when it was written. The plotline is familiar. It shows a very dark view of ordinary people trying to cope with the end of the world. That is well-done but it is the fact that the collapse of civilization is not from nuclear war or such but from a simple virus. The virus kills all members of the grass family. When you consider how many major food crops would be affected and then the domino effect of the loss of feed for animals, you are reminded of how truly vulnerable life on earth is and how easily the balance can be upset. I don't know if John Christopher was being prophetic or simply wanted a different sort of disaster for background, but with today's concerns about viruses, the book is chillingly real."
4,Good apocalyptic novel,"I found this book at the library. I had heard of it. My father told me it was published as a serialized novel in the Saturday Evening Post when he was a teenager, which caused a lot of controversy. Many people found the novel upsetting. Though somewhat tame by today's standards it is still a potent look at civilization crumbling after a plague wipes out all grass, wheat, oats, and other plants destroying most of the world's food supply. It is great in showing how quickly civilized people very well could resort to violence once civilization no longer exists. The characters and well drawn and intriguing, especially the gun expert. I recommend it."
5,Excellent Packing Tape,"Bandit tape is a thicker tape that comes off the roll very smoothly. I like it much better than the packing tape that is available at the post office and/or the drug stores. The dispenser is quite sturdy and much easier to use than other brands. It can be used with one hand! I do wish that I could find the tape refills. So far I have only found the tape/dispenser package at the ""low price"" store."
3,"People, please show how to install the gun","I checked everywhere but didn't find the answer. Bandit website said pull the tape beyond the blade. I found no way to do that. I can only let the tape go between the the two plastic blocks, but the tape keep wiggling and coming out, and the result is the tape got folded at the edge, making an ugly seal. I never find it so easy as what they show on the website."
5,great product,"this product works great for my german shephard dog with pancreatic insuffencyshe lost 11 lbs till she started on this product, 2 months ago now she gained 13 lbs, up to normal wt."
3,Imformative,What I wanted a dictionary of what my dreams mean. Not what I was looking for. But interesting reading none the less.
2,Ted Bundy!,"I may had put more stars if I didn't saw the biography of Ted Bundy on A&E, it was much better then this one on courttv. In A&E you got to know more about him and it's much more interesting, so if you compared theses 2 biographies A&E is much better, so if you want to know more about Ted Bundy and saw a good biography made of him buy the one at A&E, still the one at courttv is not that bad!"
4,"A good CD, but the other albums of Everette are better","Ok, a good album, but the other albums of Everette are surely better. It's produced by George Duke. Players: Larry Kimpel on bass, Paulinho Da Costa on percussion, ""Doc"" Powell, Michael Landau, Paul Jackson Jr. and Ray Fuller on guitar. I like Everette when plays sax, less when plays EWI."
2,NOt impressed,"This does not remove hard water stains. It does clean well, getting soap off. Use it for regular cleaning, not hard water spots."
2,I liked their toilet bowl cleaner better.,"The toilet bowl cleaner worked great, so I decided to try this for the shower. It left huge streaks that took many scrubbings with other products to remove. We thought it had etched our beautiful tiles, but fortunately, it buffed out. There was a warning about that on the label, but I did not know there was overspray I did not see."
3,Decent cleaner known to man,"It's not a bad cleaner, but I bought it mistaking it for the Lime-o-sol cleaner of the same name and a similar bottle. The other version is beyond awesome and I continue my search for it.I thought Trademarks were supposed to prevent this kind of confusion."
1,Rip Off/Bottle 1/4 full!!,I got the works cleaner today opened the humongous box (what a waste of paper) they packed it in only to find the bottle only 1/4 full of cleaner. There werent any leaks in it. The bottle's labels looked 10yrs old b/c they were all faded. What a rip!
1,Not the same as before,"This was extremely disappointing as the other products that we can get right here in town and not have to order 12, would have done just as well. Previously it had phosphoric acid in it and it would take away our super hard water stains and make the stainless steel sink shine. If it had been advertised that it no longer had phosphoric acid I would not have bought it. Just be aware if you think you are getting what you had from several months ago with a different colored label, that it is not the same formula."
1,"Unable to get past the ""Convert"" Process","In mid-August I purchased a new 3-Gig P4 mid-range Compaq laptop with Windows XP Pro, a trial version of Microsoft Office and Microsoft Works pre-installed. Using the documentation provided on Amazon.com I purchased the upgrade version of Microsoft Office 2003 Pro on amazon.com. Here it is the mid-November and I'm still trying to get the trial version to ""covert"" to the upgrade version I purchased. No documentation seems to exist, online or otherwise, and I dread the possibility of spending hours on hold to Microsoft."
1,Use Open Office - It's Free!!!,"If you want an alternative to MS Office, that is also compatible with MS Office, use Open Office. You can find it under the Google search term Open Office. It's a free download, and just as good as Office 2003. You get a Word application, a spreadsheet application, and a PowerPoint application. All are compatible with Office 2003."
4,MISSING INFO,"It would be nice if the contents were listed, with all of Microsoft's versions, it gets confusing."
2,A couple of features...but not worth the upgrade price.,"Good: Organizes your email better than Office XPCool looking interface.Bad: Crashes often, especially if you are using the businesscontacts account software.Not enough new features to make it worth upgrading"
4,Microsoft Office Pro 2003,"Microsoft Office Pro 2003 edition is a good product. It installed easily over Office Pro 1997. I haven't had any problems with it (yet). It relies heavily on online links, you probably should have a fast DSL connection or broadband if you are going to use the online links.Update:I am using Windows XP with Office Pro 2003 and today was disappointed to find that the Help menu is not as user friendly or helpful as earlier editions."
1,Webmasters Don't Buy Access 2003,"If you use Access 2002 or earlier in your websites, don't buy office 2003 because Access 2003 is not supported by anyone including bCentral, a Microsoft Company. I changed providers to bCentral after being told they did, then found they don't, plus not to mention cannot connect to their servers most of the time. As with any MS product, always errors.It has been a complete nightmare, I uninstalled 2003 and reinstalled 2002 and all my databases that I opened with 2003 are screwed up. It will take me months to fix a 1500 page website that is Access driven. Time I learned PHP or MySQL."
1,MS Office Pro Upgrade - upgrade from what?!,"The major flaw with this product is that it's not clear which version of Office you can upgrade FROM.Note: It does NOT work with Office SBE!!Various sources say various things, even the Microsoft site isn't helpful."
4,gets the job done,I was having problems accessing files which were being sent to me while I was still using Office 2000. The purchase and installation of upgrade has solved the problem.
5,"Could be named ""Before Time"" - Great Service",I really needed the software the day I ordered it. Got it in about half the time promised. Great service!!Pricing was very good. Very pleased.
2,NOT for 96-Newer Passats....,"I ordered this book because it said ""VW Passat & Audi A4 1996-2001"". It's NOT! It's for 1998-2001 Passat and 1996-2001 Audi A4. I'm still trying to find out how to send it back."
4,It's a good book for the DIY'er,"I bought this book knowing full well what year it was for, unlike another reviewer that appears to not know anything about cars. It's a good book for minor to somewhat complex repairs for the Passat and A4. It's not like a Bentley manual, but it's better than nothing, and I really don't want to pay this much for a repair book. I highly recommend this manual for the owners of these cars."
3,Good for new do-it-yourself mechanic,"The book explains pretty simple car repair jobs and includes some indepth types of repair. It has some pictures, but they might use one picture for 4 different types of repair. If you are just wondering how to preform basic car maintenance this book is for you."
3,Not as good as the factory manual,"Works for brake jobs and the like, but if you are going to do real stuff like the timing belt, get the factory manual."
3,Small,"I bought this as a xmas gift for a family member who recently splurged and got a Burberry Trench coat. I thought this might be a nice, little addition. I knew that it was going to be on the smallish side but didn't realize how small. It's practically microscopic. I ended up paying about $150 with shipping. If I had gone down the street to the outlet store I probably could have found something more appropriate.But, after-all it's a Burberry."
5,Great for Healing!,"I bought this when I was feeling real low. I am Portuguese. It made me cry, but remember my lovely grandfather, Larry Cunha who played the mandolin. Now, my other Grandparents are getting old. I play this CD for tehm and they love it. Very comforting and breathtaking even if you aren't a Portuguese girl!"
3,a cute children's cartoon,"Not quite what I expected. Produced for children, or those still young at heart. Nicely done, both storyline and animation. Held my interest the full length of the film. If you have young ones about, you won't regret adding this to your library."
3,Ford Keyless Remote,Great keyless devices. Unfortunately I needed one for a mazda 626 and these are for F150 trucks. Still would recommend.
5,Ford keyfobs,"Key fobs work great! Included instructions on programming work perfect! Was able to program both key fobs. Saved a lot of money by not having to take car into dealer, able to program right in driveway!"
5,So easy!,The instructions provided were very easy to understand and I was able to program the remote to my truck in minutes!
5,Works Great,Works just fine. Took less than a minute to program and worked right away. You can also program multiple remotes at once so this is a great buy even if you already have a remote but want a spare or if the part that attaches to the key ring broke off the remote that came with your vehicle like mine did.
5,Ford 3 Button Remote,I bought this 2002 F150 used and it came with one key and no key fob.I got another key from a locksmith but could not afford the key fob...over $60!I decided that I wanted a key fob and went searching for a good deal.I bought this one and was looking forward to putting it to use.The DIY instructions were easy and the key fob has worked with no issues since.Its a good buy.
3,works but only ok,"They were a cheap replacement, and that's what you get. They don't work from very far away, and are intermitent when they work. good for a cheap replacement, but no where near OEM."
5,GREAT,"Purchased this item after not having my OEM functioning for several months. I finally searched and purchased, hassle free configuration, works like a charm.Definitely a product worth the price and definitely beats paying the dealership 100$"
1,Stopped working after two uses.,I chose it for the price. But you get what you pay for. I bought two and neither one was any good. Company says they will replace one. I hope so if the new one works.
5,"a roll of duct tape, stepladder, jumper cables and two old trumpets.....","I bought this for my Ford truck, dealer wanted a couple hundred bucks for a replacement and then the programming charge. What a sucker I would've been if I fell for that. I got it within two days and instructions, easy-to-follow works awesome I saved literally hundreds of dollars. It took me about five minutes to program both remotes. Very good deal!"
2,Remote worked briefly,At first I was happy with the remote; it was fairly easy to set. BUT after a while the remote worked occasionally then stopped working completely. I have to keep resetting it which can be really frustrating when I need it drive my elderly father and he has to wait until I can open the driver's door then go back around to open the passenger door to help him. (He's the reason I bought it.)
5,Fast and easy to program and works perfectly,The remote appears to be identical to my '09 F-150 Ford factory remote. I had it programed in less than a minute. Instructions couldn't be easier to follow. Great purchase.
5,Very Pleased,Ordered two keyless remotes for my 2003 Ford. Delivery was quick. Programming was a breeze. And so much more affordable than buying from the dealership. Would definitely purchase again.
5,Worked Great. Just follow Instructions,"Worked exactly as it should. Because this is a security oriented device, the steps to set it up for your car need to be followed per the instructions. I should note that this supplier seemed very interested in insuring the customer would be happy with their product and service."
3,Need instructions,"This needed instructions which it did not have and had to pull up something on YouTube, it's works greet when program"
2,First ones didn't work,"Range on the generic ones ordered was terrible, had to be right next to vehicle in order for them to work. Contacted company and they were great, sent me new ones that were brand name and they worked great"
1,keyless remote,Im not happy with this remote .i programmed the remote .i had to push down hard to get it tofor work.A couple days later the remote stoped working. I got a new battery.but still not working. Would like s new one.
5,No Problem,I have a 2008 F-150. This key fob looks acts and programs just like the OEM part. This one seems to work on all 20 model Fords. Why mess with perfection.
2,Weak,Sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. And forget about being any distance from the vehicle. Poor product but you can't expect much for the price.
5,Great!,"I was skeptical because I've had problems linking keys and key fobs in the past with my car. But this worked flawlessly. Linked it up in seconds, and it works great. Seems solid."
4,item worked great,Easy instructions worked first time. Would have given 5 stars if the battery didn't die out a couple weeks after I programmed it. Otherwise it wored great.
4,Remote,Arrived in a timely fashion. This is the 3rd remote that I've purchased to replace the original. I hope this one lasts longer than the others.
3,50/50,programing was easy they both work except one i have to hit over and over and also i have to be practicaly agants the window for it to work.but the other one works good
5,Great Merchandise,Ordered remotes on line. Received in 4 days. Programmed 2 in less than 5 minutes. So easy. Thanks for the great product and service.
1,Will not work on an 08 F150,Product said it would work on my 2008 Ford F150. I purchased two of these remotes and after programming them to my pickup one of the remotes would lock the doors every fifth or six try but would never unlock the doors. The other remote did the exact opposite. It would ocassionally unlock the doors but would never lock them. I did take them both to work and programmed them to a 2004 Excursion and they worked flawlessly.
1,Barely works,"I purchased this to replace a remote that was only working about 50% of the time. This one is no better. If it does work, it's only when I'm standing at the door, and even that close it's a 50/50 shot of it not working.Waste of money, it is not any better than the remote I was replacing, except the buttons are not as worn down."
1,Not a happy customer.,"I ordered the Ford Three Button Keyless Remote. A few days later I got a blank key. I emailed the company and they sent out the remote right away. I was happy about the fast shipping but the remote wouldn't program. I tried the troubleshooting tips and still nothing. So, I'm stuck with a remote that cannot be programmed."
1,Rip off,"Do not buy this! After I finally found a dealer that was willing to program an after-market remote, it wasn't even programmable! It didn't work at all on my Chevy HHR."
2,programming,i did not realize it was complicated to program or that it would need programming. one more item for my junk drawer.
1,Dead at 2 weeks,"This unit is a cheap copy. It died after just 2 weeks. I even changed the battery to no avail. Also keep in mind, that if you have the original remotes, and you program the truck for this unit, the old remotes no longer work. Get an OEM remote and if you want a spare then you need to buy a set of matching remotes."
3,Does not beep,The instructions were fine the key fobs were fine but when I lock the doors on my truck I do not get the confirmation beep
5,Back to easy...,"I am so glad I searched this product and made the purchase. I thought it would cost a lot more than it did. The remote is exactly like the factory one that came with the truck. Now I can lock/unlock with the push of a button and I love the convenience. A+ purchase all the way around! Highly recommend this product for price, value and ease of use."
5,Finally!!,"I've been without a remote for my ford going on 3 years now. It was killing me having to open the trunk hatch first, then pressing the unlock button to open the other doors. Everywhere I went wanted $50-80 bucks to program a remote, but when I came across this I was bit skeptical, but went ahead and ordered it. The delivery was set for the Jan 7th but it arrived earlier than expected on the 4th. The directions are simple and easy to follow, so I had this baby up and running within 30 seconds. It feels so had to not have to deal with the hassle of opening through the trunk anymore. =]"
3,Good replacement product.,"Make sure that you have the code issued by the manufacture before buying a key fob, to make sure that you have a remote system. Sometimes, you cant get that code if the car is more than 10 years old. Other than that, great replacement product."
1,Not Satisfied!!!!!,Sorry!!!This idem did NOT work!! I had to reorder from another E bay company. You didn't have the right Key less entry in stock so it rolled over to the wrong idem.Cost me $12.00 It would cost me $5.00 TO SEND BACK. NOT HAPPY!!
5,BEST BEST BEST!!,"Decided to try this after getting quotes of over $100 for a replacement, read all the good reviews & figured it was worth the shot. WELL WORTH IT! Mine came earlier than expected, worked exactly as promised, & was ridiculously easy to program. Honestly was the easiest thing I did all day! I am SO happy I didnt take a dealers word for it & would recommend this company & product to anyone. I've already been spreading the word around my office & facebook since so many people need these & begrudgingly pay the overpriced quotes from elsewhere. THANK YOU guys!"
5,Great value,"Great value! Took 30 seconds to program, battery was good, and works flawlessly. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone!!"
5,lovely but quite large,"We loved this, but my mother felt it was a bit too large to wear. It is a lovely piece of workmanship though."
3,A heart tugging tale of child abuse,"The scourge of child abuse is once again brought to light in this well written story. Little Sarah Taylor struggles to overcome the unimaginable neglect and horrific abuse. This inspirational story will bring a tear to the eye of even the most hard hearted. You can feel the pain of this little eight year old girl, as the author paints a vivid description of this dark condition. Ms. Kay deftly helps us face an issue we'd much rather not think about... but should. Recommended for all."
5,A Lost Gem,"Next year will make 20 years since this album first was released and with her only top 40 hit from this album better than you and i'm in love which gained radio airplay but did not chart nearly as well it seemed to have become more forgotten over the years. Keith's voice really shines in this album not only with the two songs that made the top 100 but with other tracks on this cd such as love is alive and well, days like these and sunshine daydreamin which is a nice little upbeat song. This album may have been her only release but it is still a cd that is exceptional among the best out there!"
5,The Red Violin,"The movie is done exceptionally well and the soundtrack is haunting. Not only is it well done, the storyline, filming and substance of the film is riveting"
5,Great movie,"Great movie, the story is beautifully told and history of the instrument in the movie is superb. I recommend the soundtrack as well. A must see for violin enthusiast."
3,DVD Review,"This is one of my favorite movies and I've previously reviewed the film (VHS edition), so this will be a DVD review.The picture is quite nice as to be expected on any quality DVD and the sound is good. There are no extras on this edition which is rather sad given that the extras for this film must be fascinating. My biggest complaint and the reason why I give this DVD edition only 3 stars is the annoyance that is turning on and off the subtitles throughout the entire film. As a previous reviewer has stated the subtitles are meant for a person who has trouble hearing because it not only mentions the dialogue, but also some of the ambient noises. My guess is that very few people who see this movie can speak Italian, German, French, and Mandarin so why the subtitles for those sections aren't already on the screen is beyond me."
5,A very seductive tale,"When the famous ""Red Violin"" by Master Nicolo Bussotti turns up at a famous auction house, the story of its creation is shown in flashbacks. Beginning in the 17th century in Italy, then to an Austrian monastery, a violinist in Oxford, the Cultural Revolution in China, and finally to Montreal. Each segment is in the language of the country.The violin brings love, sacrifice, betrayal to its owners. The auction appraiser (Samuel L. Jackson) is not immune to its power and makes a life turning decision. The music helps make this a very seductive tale."
3,decent,"Not a bad movie, but it gets kind of slow in the middle, especially when the ""paganini""-type character comes in... interesting score"
2,"Hitting ""Pause"" for bathroom breaks not required","What a yawner! I can't give this movie one star only because we actually watched it through to the end, with only two short naps. Yes, it's very pretty to look at, and yes, the music is lovely, but it stops there. The violin wasn't a strong enough thread to tie the different stories together. Although we were shown why each bidder at the auction wanted the violin, there was absolutely no reason to care about the modern folks as much as their historical counterparts. Samuel L. Jackson's character is completely unlikable.By the way, Gypsies are generally far too superstitious to be grave-robbers."
3,cello over violin,"THis movie is basically about a violin which symbolize the evil of earthy processions. It tells you that greed could basically kill you. You wonder, why are all these people obssessed with this violin from italian to afro-american? It's power of greed who made a girl kill his ex while making love with an woman playing the violin. Despite all the things happening around all the characters all they can't think about is the REd Violin. This is a powerful movie with a solid cast of actors who all deserve an Oscar"
2,5 Stars? Impossible!,"While beautifully filmed, (and that's not difficult these days) most of the vignettes are extremely weak. As in many international coproductions, there seems to be a lowest common denominator factor at work. The link with Jackson is interesting but it just doesn't play true and the hoped for suspense falls flat. The Chinese section is a joke. It feels like it was filmed on a backlot in Hollywood with 4th generation Chinese Americans."
3,It is no Amadeus,"It is more than a little bit choppy. I've not felt the need to watch it again. The musical score has possibilities, except that much of it is in the higher, more squeaky, registers."
1,Lions Gate Version - BEWARE,"While I love this movie, I purchased a release on DVD from Lions Gate only to discover that there are no subtitles! What were they thinking when they released this film? The majority of it is not in English and impossible to watch by the average person. Purchase wisely!"
4,A Captivatingly Intense Story,"This movie grabs you by the neck and won't let go; it is an emotional roller coaster ride that leaves you wondering what just happened. If you love music and string instruments this is one you'll want to see.As a student of the cello, I had the good fortune to own an instrument made by Giovanni Battista Ruggieri (1653-1711) the eldest son of Francesco Ruggieri. This instrument had a wonderful tonal quality and I must admit to wondering on more than one occasion about the stories it could tell if it were able. This movie dramatically permits the ""Red Violin"" to, in effect, tell its story.This movie is not for general audiences and has some rather explicit sexuality at one point. I do recommend this movie for mature audiences, especially those who love music and string instruments in particular."
5,One of 1999's Best!,"After seeing this movie, I expected it to garner more Oscar nominations. I was moved by this ensemble cast that took us on a violin's voyage through time: from 17th Century Italy, 18th Century Austria, 19th Century Oxford, China during the Cultural Revolution, and the Montreal of today. This movie was visually impressive, brilliant performances by the ensemble cast, and the story itself is just plain enchanting. Kudos to the Academy for rightly recognizing the masterful musical score of John Corigliano (performed by the great violinist, Joshua Bell)."
4,Awesome!,"Just saw this for the first time a month ago. It immediately went to my top 5 movie list. You have to pay attention though, it doesn't make it easy to keep up with the plot and it is well worth the ""work""."
2,red Violin,"I was disappointed in this movie. I had heard such good reviews about it, but I didn't like it at all when I saw it"
1,Spoiler Alert: This Instrument Does Not Hold Its Tune,"If you like eating tripe, drinking cheap wine, and think Andre Rhue is the world's greatest musician, you'll love this film. Otherwise, stay away."
2,The Red Violin,Story itself was good. But the story develop and sceen edditing was no so much exciting.
2,Boring but colorful remake of LA RONDE,"The basic plot of LA RONDE (used previously for such films as THE YELLOW ROLLS ROYCE) is rehashed here in the form of a famous violin and its many owners since its creation. It's a cursed thing so brings only tragedy to those who covet it (somewhat like Wagner's RING). This vastly overlong film is lethargically directed with no point of view or connecting thread between the stories and when we get the great revelation at the end we realize we guessed it in the first reel. The faux ""classical"" music score by serious composer John Corigliano was Oscared. The Art Direction, Costume Design and Cinematography are all of merit and worth mention but the thing never gets off the ground or soars - you'd think it would considering the music the instrument makes. If you're an afficianodo of the violin, this will please you. If not, avoid it."
5,The best movie of 1999,"This is the most artistically made movie of the year. The cast is awesome and the story line was so original. It is also interesting to note that couples can perform fornication while one plays the violin. The editing of the whole movie linked so well, kind of like Pulp Fiction and I think it is praise worthy to the director how he indirectly showed that the whole world is linked to music."
1,Red Violin DVD,"This movie is in apx four different languages with no translations. It looked like a good movie, but had no clue what was going on. I did notify Amazon and they did a total refund of my money, plus a five dollar credit on my next purchase."
2,"High Expectations, Little Satisfaction",The music didn't really grab me and the story seemed forced. I think many of the characters were miscast including the lead. I never really connected with any of them.
4,Mesmerizing!,"The interplay of past and present , leading up to, distancing, repeating, anticipating ... all came together rather remarkably. Samuel Jackson's character was a bit of a long shot to immediately grasp, but it worked okay. The mystery of the violin's color seemed more interesting than astonishing. Other than those two ""quirks,"" it's definitely a ""DVD buy."" I'm a violin player, so I am partial - this movie made me take the 'ol instrument from the closet and befriend it once again. Enjoy! P.S. The CD soundtrack is like the ""Energizer Bunny"" on steroids. Me and my pet rats were startled (heart beats suspended) on several selections."
5,I adore this movie!,"This is one of my all time favorite films. Interesting and clever story line, beautiful music, violin by Joshua Bell, gorgeous scenery, and fabulous costumes. This movie has it all. I gave it as gifts to my friends."
5,The Red Violin/Corigliano...5 stars,"Well, being the fact that the composer who wrote the score for this movie happens to be my teacher. I knew about the music/score ahead of time. The story is very deep... the violin survives for hundreds of years and the same melody is always played by the one tho has the instrument. I learned so much from this movie!In fact, some peope don't know that musical instruments are worth millions of dollars according on who made them or who owned them. Thanks to my teacher i bought the DVD and it was worth it (my teacher won the academy award for best original score) and thanks to him I got to know the movie and the music.it's a great movie to watch if you are into music or art."
5,Beautiful movie and beautiful music,"I can remember the first time i saw this movie and recall just being brought to tears by the music alone. It is so well composed and joshua bell on the violin as soloist is amazing and to today is still one of my favorite solo artists for the violin. And the movie itself is just one of my favorite surprises to date. I went to the oriental downtown milwaukee expecting a dramatic samuel jackson movie and got an astounding foreign film rich and beautiful with multiple languages and cultures. The story of this violin painted with the blood of the makers wife and strings strung of her hair is so poetic and profound with disaster and sorrow!! It is a movie where there is nothing particularly grand, glorified or wonderful about any of the characters because it is all about the violin and its music of harrowed history."
5,Excellent Movie,"This was a beautifull movie. Although viewers may be turned off by the fact that it is subtitled, it is still a very good film. The fact that the movie has five different languages is what makes this film special. The characters are real and you see a good side in everyone. The story of a red violin and the people who have owned it is very original. I am highly impressed with this film."
2,Save your MONEY!,"What a borefest! The story comes together in the last few minutes after following the history of the red violin. Which is long and boring. The only part that was of any interest was why the red violin was red. Now that was cool, its SPOILER ALERT: blood of the creators wife.Wow, the rest of the story was just terrible! I wish I could get that time I watched the DVD back! Don't waste your money, get it at the library first if you really want to see this one. Its a miss in a huge way."
3,It was a gift,"I have no idea if this is a good book or not, but I'll say yes since the person I gave it too seems to enjoy it."
5,WHY AMAZON'S REWIEW IS SO UNFAIR,"Just consider average customer's rewiews 4.5 stars and then consider Amazon's, just unfair.This, along with The Legend of 1900, are one of my top 10 movies.I have two copies just in case one gets damaged ¡"
5,Red Violin,The Red ViolinI saw this movie on TV one nite and decided I had to own it. I received a DVD and have watched it several times. The story is so haunting and surreal. I definitely would call it a three hanky story. A keeper.
5,Touching and beautiful,This movie was an emotional masterpiece. The music of the violin and the compelling plot kept me nailed to my couch. This will play on your heart strings.
5,Fascinating Story ... Lots of Intrigue,"""The Red Violin"" is one of the most fascinating films I've ever seen. Samuel L. Jackson purchases the violin at auction and goes about learning its complex history. The instrument has passed through many hands since its making, and has affected many lives (e.g., a Russian orchestra consisting of orphans). I do not want to give too much of the plot away, as there are many fascinating twists and turns before the final revelation is made. If you like beautifully constructed films with some intrigue, you will thoroughly enjoy this one."
3,violinist,This movie is good for viewers who are interested in learning about history and about the violin. It was really captivating and inspiring to a musician like myself.
2,great dvd.. but the sync is soft,I waited and waited for this movie to be relaesed on dvd..... when I bought it I rushed back to the office to pop it in the player and turned up the reciver to listen to the full 5:1 mix.... and then I noticed something.. the audio sync was a hair off... I work for a dvd authoring house and thought I was being picky.. then someone walked in and noted the same thing.. it was out of sync.. its only a hair out... but thats enough for me.. i'd wait awhile to they put a newer version out.. This is a great movie!~
4,The Red Violin ( remastered ),Product was as described. The one click option actually cost me a bit more! That was not a good surprise!! ;(
2,Beautiful but Boreing.,"I had trouble getting through this one. By the time the story had moved to China I felt lost and bewildered. This film is extremely hard to follow and quite boreing. I originally rented this because Samuel L. Jackson was in it. He had a small part and seemed to be the most interesting character in the whole film.I did however enjoy the music and the scenery, it was quite beautiful."
2,The Red Violin - a movie w/out a lasting impression,"I found The Red Violin to be both boring and unmoving. The story follows the 'life' of a violin created in the 1600s and the movie consists of several individual stories woven together by the present-day scene of an auction at an Auction House as well as a tarot reading consisting of cards including Death, Justice, The Moon and the Hanged Man.The movie attempts to portray to the viewer the importance and wonder of music, particularly that played by the violin but at the same time the movie does not leave any lasting impression on the viewer and bar an interesting twist at the end of the movie, your time would be better spent catching up on some sleep.The best part of the movie is some original editing techniques that make for an interesting film study but for those looking for an entertaining, relaxing movie, I suggest you look elsewhere."
1,Roger Ebert WOULD love this movie.,"Come on, folks - it's $7 for a reason. I was so bored I almost cried. Why didn't they take the money they wasted on a horrible film like this and go feed an African city for a day?"
1,Greta Scacchi's character,"I agree with the Amazon.com reviewer, but the subject of my comment is something else:Interesting that so many pepole assume that Victoria is Frederick Pope's mistress. I figured she was his wife. After all, she did inherit the estate.It's unfortunate that people think that sex can't possibly be that good unless it's illicit.(Not that I believe that sex between unmarried partners is illicit-- but marriage gives sex a stamp of propriety, at least in our society.)"
1,"Pretentious ""Art Film""","Bad acting, bad script, pretentious ""art"" film that has no soul and accomplishes nothing. What a waste of time and money. The potential is there, it just doesn't deliver."
4,"Good, but needs work","I am currently on chapter 13 of this book. It is a really nice, well writen book. It doesnt bog you down a lot with grammar and the drills and excercises are really helpful. This books gives you small chunks at a time, so if you take your time with it, you can really learn a lot in my opinion. There are two things wrong with it though.1) The pronounciation section, I think its lacking. There should be more examples and a few more oral excercises before the start of the real coursework2) There are some typos in it that are a small nuisance, like for example when they intended to make a statement bold and the forget to make the last word bold, or in some few instances the last letter of a word might be capitalized when its not supposed to. An example would be the word ""doi"" (radio -- the accents were left off), and in some instances it was typed as ""doI"", just a silly typo.all in all it is a good book."
2,Japanese Inn,"I think this book is excellent if you are looking for a historical representation of Japan. However, I am more interested in daily life through the view point of an average Japanese citizen. This book provided more historical facts than ideas about what life was really like in a Japanese Inn during that time period."
2,Hinges are very poor quality,"Purchased two of these coolers; rushed shipped to go camping this weekend and when they arrived on Thursday, one of the cooler's hinges were broken. Was very disappointed with the overall quality of the hinges and closing latch. When I called Brand Variety, the shipper for Amazon, they offered to send another set of cheap hinges but would not use next day delivery. When I expressed my dissatisfaction, they offered to send call a call tag and if they have another one in stock, they would reship but if they don't they will refund my money. This really made me mad so I am considering sending both back.....Igloo does not make the cooler it use to...quality is poor and the cheap hinges will split.."
3,No Trays!,"I got two of these to replace the two igloo 48s on my swamp buggy that finally broke down after years of rough use. The Maxcold 50s are slightly bigger and noticably thicker walled. I'm sure they're going to out perform the 48s but I can't use them untill I figure out a tray system for them. What a disappointment that Igloo didn't include a tray for these or even offer one as an accessory. I know some folks don't use the cooler trays but I really make use of them. The trays from the 48s don't fit in these either. What a pain. ""You're on my poop list Igloo"""
4,Grupo Mania is top merengue,"3 1/2*I am working my way back thru Grupo Mania. I have heard, and I am seeing myself that they are a group that just got better and better with each alblum.Their latest album, Latino, won a grammy, and is really an impressive album, managing to be highly original and distinctive, no small feat. Their singing is absolutely impreccable.The previous Mania 2050 is a longer, and in a way a more serious album. The songs are less unusual then Latino, but there are some really good songs, and the singing is great.Master of the Stage precedes these two. It is very similar in conception to Mania 2050, but overall the songs are less strong, and get to be a bit repetitious. This is not to say they are not good, but just relative to the two latter albums. There are indeed several standouts, especially the salsa that ends the album.The boys' singing is absolutely fine, but they got even more polished and sophisticated on their last two albums."
4,Open Plastic Sleeve Up First,"Hi I know some people wrote about the plastic sleeves leaving something on their DVD/CD and since they are plastic right before you put a Disc in one you will want to open the sleeve (i use my nails on my hand)that way it will clear anything that might be there ,I could only see a build up on a couple sleeves but it is 2 too many ,I hope this helps ,I have been using these for the last decade or so and my only complaint is wishing they were less expensive since Amazon will not give me free shipping on these even though I buy something from Amazon over $25 alsoty Mark"
4,satisfied,good product fast shipping. just an all in all smooth transaction nothing special. to be expected by a company doing it right.
4,What residue?,"I have purchased these CD sleeves 3 times in the past and have never found any residue like the other reviewers reported. In fact, several of my friends have ordered these sleeves after I using mine. In fact, I came to order more today and was surprised to see the negative reviews."
4,Fun & Different Happy Book,"I really enjoyed the book. It was a different, Feel Good, book and left room for thought. How good am I with money? What would I do? I enjoyed it and am sharing it with family. Thanks!"
4,Old fashioned and sweet,"Best of all perhaps, it is a middle aged romance written in a friendly, funny way with slightly cliched but nonetheless enjoyable characters."
2,Common Sense Parenting Kit,I was very disappointed because I didn't receive a video in my package. I felt it was a rip-off and very deceptive!!!
2,Only Somewhat Humorous and Weak,"Its a sarcastic view of management from the point of R&D scientists. From the point of view of the R&D scientists you get to see some of the underhanded and self serving behavior of incompetent management at the fictional company and how it is tolerated by senior members of management. Unfortunately the book does not explore how ""The Company"" which was once an R&D powerhouse, got to be in this dysfunctional state. Also the book offers very little hope for dealing with a company in this type of state, short of the company being acquired or getting lucky and having unintended benefits during a passive/aggressive power struggle amongst management. If you were attracted to reading this book by the title ""Management by Vice"" I would recommend skipping this one and instead read The Below-the-Belt Manager by Eric Broder which I found to be more Humorous than this book."
5,"Humorous, yet candid","Most of the satiritical episodes in CB Don's book entitled "" Management by Vice"" are quite familiar scenes in both commercial and government settings. ""Gettting ahead"" at the expense of one's integrity as well as colleagues' future is the only means for some people. Greed often blinds ambitious management. A quick promotion and fat bonouses are the driving forces for these managers. Hence, short-term goals, say 3 to 5 years, are all thay care about at present, regardless of the future of the organization. Cooperation mergers are too common a way to survive and getting ahead than collisons on the highway, and lay-off is only a part of the evolutionary process, in the commercial world, where survival of those who are most vocal, but are deficient in both technical skills and vision, seems to be the rule. I thoroughly enjoyed reading CB Don's book. It is humorous, yet candid. I highly recommend it to the current managers and those who are old enough to drink...."
3,wanted to like it,"I thought the idea was hilarious and was really looking forward to reading this book, but I just couldn't get into it."
4,An entertaining and informative read,"Although I have not experienced the style of management referred to in this book, the writer makes clear, in an entertaining style, the consequences of this type of mismanagement. I would not be surprized if this type of management is more widespread than I had first thought and therefore this book merits a good review."
1,Disappointed,I purchased to my understanding another time another place by Sandi Patty and received Classical Hightlight vol.2die Moldau .
5,This must be heaven,Along with the likes of Twila Paris and Rita Baloche Sandi Patti makes you feel nothing is better than listening to gospel music. My favourite song here is 'Unexpected friend' but in truth all the tracks are good. Hard to find these days but buy it if you do find it.
5,Indispensible in My Camp Kitchen,"I hesitated to buy this cookset because of the price - I usually just use old pots and pans for camping. However, I needed a set of pots and decided to buy this based on the size of the pots and their portability. The set is now indispensible when I camp. I use the pots on my Coleman portable stove, and they are the perfect fit. I've cooked everything from rice to stew in them, and they perform very well. They heat evenly and quickly, and I have never had a problem cleaning them, even with biodegradable dish soap. The clamp-on handle took a few tries to get used to, but I find I like it much better than if a metal handle had been welded or riveted on - because it is not integrated into the pot, it never gets hot, so no potholders are needed. The lid fits both pots well, and the kit fits neatly into the pouch and takes up little room in my gear container. These are a must-have for me now, I won't camp without them."
5,"Nice little cook set, perfect for a couple","We asked for and received this for a wedding gift, and we've used it several times on camping trips since. The pots are quite light weight, and small enough to take back-packing, but also large enough to heat a decent amount of water for cooking, cleanup, or drinking. The pot grabber tool is great as well, because we don't have to worry about handles flopping around when precariously balanced on a backpacking cook stove. We can also make plenty of food in one of these for us both. I don't have anything bad to say about it. I'm kind of sad to see it's not available any more, as I would recommend it to others who need a versatile cooking set."
4,Great for 2 small dogs....,The only fault with this stroller is putting it in the car. Very difficult if you own a sedan.
4,"Good points, a true 'Biography of Belief'","A collection of 4 well-constructed and interesting essays about mythology and its relevance today.Leeming moves beyond the mire of fundamentalism-bashing (a fun pastime nonetheless), and tries to frame mythic symbols as they may be evolving and expressing themselves in the modern world.As a quick overview of mythology, this little book satisfies even the scholar, and as a delving into the rich study of myth this book satisfies even more.The strongest and most interesting part of Leeming's method is the dialogue he creates between 'believers' of different myths.For that alone makes this book great."
1,NOT WHAT I EXPECTED....,Didnt like this book at the begining because it took sooooo long o get to the story.... the middl was great with all he drama but not ll that.... But the ending sucked an it made me jus HATE this book..... Im mad i wasted my time reading it... But the great thing about this experience was that the book was shipped two or three days later an the book was in great shape... so illl rate five for that bt the book really sucks...
3,Ms. Morrison Can Do So Much Better Than This...,"The characters were difficult to follow and I almost stopped reading the book altogether because of my growing disdain for the main character (Darius) and my fatigue at reading through his latest human exploits (woman after woman after woman). But somehow through it all, I hung in there...barely. The plot eventually took off but overall, this is just an average read."
3,5 Stars...NOPE!,"I will say this. Mrs. Morrison has a flare for erotic writing. She's damn good at that. Her storylines however are not that great. I couldn't finish this book. It was slow and tormenting. And I must add VERY CONFUSING AT TIMES. It's not fair that a reader has to read ALL of her books just to know what the hell is going on with ONE. That makes no sense to me. Mrs. Morrison you can definitely write, but it's time to break your series of events up. Last, I will also say the Somebody's gotta be on top was a lot better than He's just a freind."
4,Here I Go Again! Mary Morrison is on TOP!,"Yes, yes, Ms. Morrison laid out another sequel that kept me tuned in and begging for more. For the last few months, I have been on a roller coaster ride with reading Mary Morrison's titles, and Brenda Hampton's titles. Both have sequels that keep you entertained and Darius and Jaylin have a lot in common. Even though I'm drained from reading about these bad boys, I LOVE IT! I'd like to see these two authors put a story together where these two brothers meet. The only reason I gave this book four stars is because Jaylin's character has a slight bit edge over Darius. However, I'm crazy about them both. Keep'em coming, Mary, and I can't wait for your next title to be released!"
4,MORE DRAMA',Somebody's Gotta Be On Top is the company started by Darius Jones after he gets demoted at his mother's company. Same Darius...even more drama! Ms. Morrison writes this series to read like a soap opera and I enjoyed every minute!
3,Good Read,"Ok Mary B. Morrison had me all ready for another installment in this on going series of Darius, Jada, Wellington, Ashley and the gang. Somebody's Gotta Be on Top is He's Just a Friend but told from Darius' point of view. It was a good read but I was ready to move forward with the story."
3,"Good Style Guide, Newer Edition Available","I have and use this book daily, BUT beware. I ordered this version of the AP Style Guide, and it is NOT the most current version. There is more recent version of the book that includes Internet terms. I do recommend this book, but make sure that you order the most recent edition."
3,The AP Stylebook is not invaluable.,"The AP Stylebook is certainly a valuable reference for writers and editors, but it's not invaluable -- it costs $12 at Amazon. It's a sad commentary on the state of American reading, writing, and thinking that numerous reviewers who purport to be familiar with the Stylebook refer to it as ""invaluable."" Further, prospective buyers should keep in mind that although the Stylebook is one of a number of useful guides to newswriting, other references (e.g., Chicago Manual, Strunk & White, Words into Type) are probably more appropriate for other types of writing."
4,Non-Fiction,"This is definitely excellent, and anybody who is producing journalistic work, from first year students turning up to classes, or people doing it occasionally to everday professionals can benefit from having this.It is likely the latter will wear it out, too, at least if it is a print version.For non-journalist probably a useful read to give you an idea if the people you are reading are providing information in the generally accepted manner that they are supposed to be doing."
2,Bucket with a seam,The back side of the bucket has a seam an inch wide. The seam is the same as on a commercial HVAC system and not too appealing looking. I returned the bucket.
5,"great history of working dogs, Kerry Blue fans take note","I discovered this book after reading about it in Bryan Cummins' excellent Terriers Of Scotland & Ireland. Cummings says, ""The Kerry is the only terrier included in Hubbard's Working Dogs of the World (1948). Hubbard acknowledged the breed's historic use as drover and guardian of sheep and cattle. Hubbard contended that the breed is descended from a now-extinct sheep-herding dog of the ancient Celts called the Gadhar."" Though Cummins does disagree with this belief, thinking the Kerry does not have herding dog blood in it."
4,Great Nat King Cole album with great Stan Kenton and Count Basie,"The late Nat Cole is one of those treasures of American Music. He was a great Jazz pianist and singer, no doubt. Also a stylish balladeer with great albums but with some neglectable ones.This bigband collection is a must, a great showcase of his recordings with Count Basie, Stan Kenton, and with arrangements by Billy May although it covers not all his bigband material.Commercially well succeed 'Madrid' as well as 'Orange Colored Sky' are included and keep me singing 'flash-bam, alakazam, suddenly you came by'. Great!"
5,a great artist,"ricky has a quality of voice that is wonderful ,and can reach your heart and soul.God gave ricky a beautiful talent ,and gifts beyond measure."
1,Rats Love This Stuff...,"After spreading the bait around my garage for several weeks and watching it disappear, the rats finally got tired of waiting for me to put it out and chewed through the bucket to get to the bait. Too bad it doesn't seem to be poisonous enough to actually kill them -- it has been three months now and they just keep coming back for more."
1,Completely worthless,"I live in a 2nd floor NYC apt and have been battling with the rats that have taken refuge on my fire escape. They have managed to dig through several inches of brick and establish residence in my walls. Through desperation I bought a bucket of this stuff hoping to eradicate my unwanted guests. After laying bait for weeks now, I am seeing no effect. In fact, the rat colony has grown in number and is at least a dozen strong. I have even went as far as stuffing the blocks down the rat holes only to find them unscathed and discarded to the side the next day. I really doubt this thing is even palatable to rats. The have a relatively strong odor but are as hard as cinder blocks. The poison may or may not be potent but these NYC rats aren't taking the bait.It's past midnight now and since I started typing this review an 8 inch rat came up to my window sill. I shone my lamp at him and he stared right back me. Needless to say, I will be looking for alternative methods."
5,"works great, love it!",We only put one bait bar out after seeing multiple rats near our compost pile. within a day the bar was gone and within a week we found dead rats. i love this stuff!
1,Poor Value,I think that Racoons like this product more than mice. I have reverted back to old style traps.This product is far too expensive for unknown results.
4,I love them!,I am very happy with my first purchase of Frye Harness 8r boots! I am even more impress with the delivery.
4,Beautiful pair of boots,This is a beautiful pair of boots. The best boots I ever purchased. But it is a hassle to put them on and take off. I'm used to boots with zippers but these do not have zippers.
3,I smell cheap glue,"Just got these boots and I'm suspicious I might have gotten a fake one. This pair has a strong smell of ""cheap"" glue. This is my second pair of frye boots and there was practically no such smell with my first pair. The boots look great and feel comfy. I'm just not sure if I got the real thing. Oh by the way I bought it from (...). The smell of glue is my only issue. Anyone has a way of verifying the authenticity of this item please let me know."
5,Excellent!,The product purchased was excellent. High quality materials and very durable. These will last a very long time for my husband. The fit was perfect. The only downside to the boot was that the soles are very hard and my husband bought insoles to put in them.
1,Leaking Water,"I purchased this boot two years ago. Now it's leaking water from bottom. I really do not recommend it! The price is high makes you think it's supposedly the best but, this product was a big failure for me."
2,"Wowzer, what a stinker!","Oh my, not good. Not good at all. While the first Toxic Avenger was a very ""good"" movie that still holds up today, none of the sequels even came close. Both parts two and three were filmed at the same time and were meant to be one film. But they turned it into two separate movies when they realized the had such an overflow of crap. Even Lloyd Kaufman said that he made this and part three just to turn a quick buck.I'd rather watch Redneck Zombies or Beware! Children at Play before Toxic Avenger Part II."
1,A REAL WORLD CONSULTANT,"This is easily the most boring book ever written on Strategy! It adds little or no new value, whatsoever. Ghemawat, seems to specialize in taking extremely simple concepts and twisting them into unintelligent gibberish. I bought this book hoping that a famous Harvard Business School proffesor would have some insights; I was disappointed from page 2. Buy this book only if you are: (i) Billing your client while you learn the basics of strategy (and common sense) or (ii) a HBS student taking Ghemawat's class. In the latter case ""May God be with you (because no consulting company will be!)."""
4,"This book gives you the ""language"" of the gym","I liked reading this book but I don't know exactly how scientific some of the terms are; like when he calls people who jerk the weights around for high reps ""pumpers."" I usually refer to them as time wasters because they are injuries waiting to happen. The book does present you with modern training methods, but if I have to recommend one book.....Steve Reeves' new book ""Building the Classic Physique"" is still the best."
3,Color is much lighter than shown!,"The shoes are great Keen all the way! The color came in as tan, not a brown buffalo color. there was only 1 color choice when I ordered and it wasn't even close to the picture. I love the comfort of the shoes so I will probably rub some waterproofing into them to darken them up to closer to the picture. If it wasn't for the color, I would vote 5 stars!"
4,Good looking shoes,"I would say these are good looking, sort of stiff with sort of a hard foot bed. I think they will break in fine, but would say not comfortable right out of the box. Other Keens I've had seem more comfortable right away, but I like the looks of these."
4,Almost Perfect,"I'm on my third pair of Portsmouths. I find them to be the most comfortable shoe I've ever put on my feet. The only thing keeping them from being perfect is that on all three pairs, the glue where the leather meets the toe-box has deteriorated rather quickly. It starts out as a white residue along the edge of the toe-box on the sides of the shoe and eventually you start seeing a gap there. Luckily for me, I live in a dry climate so water getting into this gap isn't so much of a problem but I can only imagine someone living in a wetter area would soon find their toes wet."
5,30 Years old and the start of greatness,"Collecting tracks from his earlier blue note albums(genius of modern music volumes 1 and 2)of brilliance is hard to do because each cut is great...now, these 2 remastered cd's really shine with the original artwork and alternate takes...But,this CD is a sampler and the way to go as all reviewers insist..the complexity is all here as Monk strays in his world but it is all very centered,the eccentricity is structured within beautiful music.The seeds were planted here."
4,I love Soccer Charm,MY daughter will love this charm. She is a soccer freak......The writing is large enough to read and the heart is nice and bright and big to see it.
5,Great Product,"I love this pen. It is very stylish and writes very well. I use this pen for business and clients are impressed with the look of the pen. It has the look and feel of a pen that is much more expensive, but at the price here, it can't be beat. The refills for the ceramic rollerball can be a little difficult to find, but I use Schmidt rollerball refills and I love them. Again, this is one of the smoothest writing instruments around."
5,Very deceloped characters and an awesomely exting read,"I saw the movie and I loved it and then I read the book and found it so much more developed with realistic characters and a real plot. It is definetly better than the movie and as usual Crichton keeps you at the edge of your seat as you might say. The story starts with an old rich and arrogant(not the very nice sweet old grandpa he plays in the movie) buissnes man named Hammond gathers scientits and promises to payment to take a shot at the impossible, to recreate an extinct species......To clone dinosaurs, and put them in high secruity amuesment park Jurassic Park. A team of scientist Ian Malcom the mathematician, Alan Grant the paleontologist, and others are hired also under high pay to check out the park and tell if the park is safe etc. And then convince the stuborn lawyers of Hammond of there opinion. Once there they are facinated, but after a while things start to go terribly wrong............."
5,Really Great!,"Jurassic Park was one of most interesting, and fantastic novels that I ever read. The reason that I started to read this book was because I liked to read about dinosaurs. I knew it would be good story, but I never thought that it would be great! One of the parts that I liked was when dinosaurs started to get out and cause the damage in Jurassic Park. It was described very well(especially T-rex) and it gave chills. I really recommand this book to everyone that reads my review."
2,It jumped around too much for me,"O.K. maybe I didn't like it because my ninth grade teacher made me read it. I thought it was good, but not as good as the movie because it was totally different. Other than that it was O.K., but I would not read it again because it is too confusing with all the jumping around from spot to spot."
5,Jurassic Park,I purchased this item as a text book for my son. It arrived on time and the condition was excellent.
5,"A nonstop action,edge of your chair , a thriller!","I was 10 years old when I read the book. At fist I thought it would be boring. IT WASN'T!. I started reading it in class and was forced to put it down. Out of the three and a half I've read ""JP"" is the best!"
5,Crichton's best sci-fi novel yet,"It is doubtful this book will be surpassed by any other science fiction writer. Crichton knows how to combine drama and a really good story with scientific explanations, so you actually learn something while reading it. My copy is now tattered and dog eared, I've read it so many times. It's impossible to get tired of re-reading it."
4,Very true.A mix of horror and drama.,"In my opinion, it was beter than lost world.I read it twice I only chose 4 stars because the begining bored me a little.Fiction, yet nonfiction. Very exiting.I think Jurasic Park was better than Crichton's other bestseller; Airframe."
4,Jurrassic Park,I think Jurrassic Park was a great book. Crichton makes you almost scared of velociraptors. The only bad thing is Ian Malcolm. He kept on about how everyones gonna die.
3,Book Review: Jurassic Park,"Jurassic Park is an excellent science fiction novel. Although many people already know about the movie, the original book has more events, settings, and people. This book is true to Michael Chrichton's writing syle: strong and somewhat gory. One part that I have always liked, although it is not in the movie, is the beggining, A small girl is vacationing with her family, and goes out looking for birds. She finds a strange 3-toed, 1-foot-tall lizard that wals upright on two feet and begins playing with it. The lizard is friendly for several minutes until it becomes vicious and attacks her. As it turns out, the the lizard is really a dinosaur which excaped from a neighboring island, Jurassic PArk. The rest of the book's plot line is similar to that of the movie, but has a few differant details and many events that didn't appear in the film, such as a surpirse ending. I would suggest this book to any mature reader who wouldn't mind a bit of gore."
3,What does he know about dinos?,M.C. knows nothing about how dinos acted (nobody know for that matter.) How can he write a book in which no one in the world knows about? Most things in this book are irrelivant. I won't even start on the Lost World because it is a lot worse than this book. M.C. should have stopped with this one!
3,The movie was better.,"I read this book before it became a movie. Compared to the best science fiction books like Ender's Game, it was only a 6. The best part is Crichton's explanation about how dinosaurs were reconstructed from traces of their DNA. After that, the story turns into a mild thriller which is just okay as far as thrillers go. The movie didn't capture the technology of producing dinosaurs quite as well as the book but seeing dinosaurs live on screen more than made up for that. This is one of the few times were the movie was better than the book. I didn't like the book's message about how bioengineering is destine to produce some unavoidable catastrophe but there wouldn't be as much of a story if Jurassic park was a great success and made a lot of money for all it's investors."
1,Lame-Brained Anti-Technology Babble,"Weak! If you like non-stop action without any genuine stimulus to your think gland, this is your book! If you really actually want to ponder today's issues, and be forced to think new thoughts (as I do), then this ranks right up there with the words of wisdom you'll find on your local outhouse walls. ... It is irrationally anti-technology as well. I'll summarize the book for you, here, & save you the trouble of bothering to read it: ""Slash-clash, grunt & howl, buckle my swash. Oh, yes: Lest we think it's all mindless, we've included something for you highbrow folks... Technology leads to Chaos, and Chaos is Badness""."
3,THE SECOND LORD OF THE FLIES,"I give this novel 3.5 stars because like this book but the movie and the second book are so much better. And as I have said before there is a lot of material in here that is completely remanicent of Sir William Golding's ""LORD OF THE FLIES."" This is a good book to read but because of some moments that are not too exciting that I would not like to mention here. Thank you for your time on reading my review."
3,The Movie is Better,"Okay, so the book does a better job at explaining the characters' feelings and explains more of the ""amusement-park"" idea, but I must conclude that the movie is superior. The book's sequences with Grant and the kids are somewhat dragging and caused me to lost interest eventually, and the beginning is much less logical. During the beginning, we learn that the raptors have gotten off the islands and are antagonizing those on mainland Costa Rica, but how the heck were they able to get across the ocean? C'mon Crichton, be realistic!"
3,Jurassic Park,"Michael Crichton's 1990 novel, Jurassic Park is about a man who clones dinosaur DNA and makes dinosaurs. This is interesting, but the book is more focused on the technological aspects of cloning dino DNA than the inferior movie. The book can get boring at times (usually the parts that involve conversation on Chaos Theory, DNA, etc.) but there is enough action to keep you interested. The book is rather slow-paced; the dinosaurs aren't even involved directly in the story into at least 250 pages into the book. The characters are the book's main failure, however. The characters in the book are just card-board cut-outs that only speak when necessary. There is hardly any personalities to the characters, just you're stereotypical kid's and scientists. Actually, now that I think of it, this book stinks... read it if it's a rainy day or something... but otherwise, give it a toss."
2,Sloppy and Careless Thriller,"Crichton at his best builds his novel with careful research and attention to detail, which is why Jurassic Park is so disappointing. Dinosaurs get out when electric fences fail, even though they are supposed to be enclosed by moats as well. Rivers seem to flow up hill. Basic addition fails (the sum of three closely related normal distributions is not a three-peaked distribution). The chaos theory is profoundly misunderstood: most chaotic systems are in fact tightly bounded. The biology is also bad. Although Crichton gives lip service to warm-blooded dinosaurs, major plot devices link them to amphibians in unrealistic ways. Crichton would have been better served by either making the book a shameless fantasy or by taking the time to get the details right; but pretending to a meticulousness that is so repeatedly betrayed makes the book frustrating to read."
2,Ick On Jurassic,"An evil, sleazy book, unheroic and malevolently mystical. Ian Malcolm, the mathematician, expresses the novel's theme. This character's central philosophy carries the weight of the novel's theme. Ew! Ick! These aspects never come up in the movie, which was a relief and a good entertainment. But as a novel -- ew ! ick! A arch-Catholic with a vile and anti-Man view of reality. But enjoy the movie like a cartoon carnival treat. It has nothing to do with the rotten essence that is the meat of this novel."
4,A Paperback sized Hardback : o,"Purchased several of our favorite Crichton books in hardback for our bibliophile daughter, and were VERY surprised to discover that this one was essentially a paperback size/format, that had been converted to a hardback cover, lol!! Since we clearly had neglected to check the small print : \ we decided, (correctly), that she would probably not mind, and further, might even find it funny enough, and opted to give it to her anyway.But - if you are planning to give it as a true gift to a more discerning reader, we thought other customers might be thankful to learn from our mistake!"
4,"Not great, but good.","I really enjoyed the scientific aspects of the book and the accuracy in which they described each dinosaur. I found it was easier to visualize the dinosaurs in the movie. Nothing against the book, but I think it is easier to watch the movie and get the general idea of the story."
5,The best book on earth after The Lost World.,This book is quite different form the movie. A well writtern book on dinasours. I hope to see more of this type soon.
2,Disappointed in size of book,"I have only myself to blame for not reading the specifications about the book closely enough, but, I thought I was ordering a normal hardback version of this book, not a paperback version with a hard cover. That's essentially what it is. The pages are small with very small lettering like a regular size paperback book. A hard cover has been added so it is technically a hardback. I will keep it but am greatly disappointed. I do wish that in the description the seller had pointed out that this is NOT a normal size hardback best seller. That might help to keep another buyer from making the same mistake. Again, I should have read the measurements of the book and not assumed it was a normal, hardback book. Live and learn!"
1,Not Really a Hardback,"This is not what I consider to be a Hardcover book. It does in fact have a hard cover, but is merely a paperback that has been bound with a cardboardy cover. Who really wants something like this? Not me. Remember to always check the dimensions before purchasing a book. Seems silly that I need to do this, but obviously I do."
1,An exciting ride through the theme park from hell!,The truly sensational book that keeps you on edge throughthe whole ride. The suspense of this novel is that ofnothing that I have ever seen. Chricton is truly the masterof drawing a mental image of the dinosaurs in our times.
1,Atrocious,"I was forced to read this for a class some years ago and frankly, it's horrid. I found it dull and lacking in any real literary flair. I, an insomniac, fell asleep reading this book. I didn't like the tone, language, or the plot. The only character I liked was Malcom and he died so I found the book of little interest."
1,Jurassic Park,"This in my opinion was a horribly boring and stupid book, it jumped around too much in the beginning. I was happy to put the book down. It was a horrible assignment I was given for Bio. At the begin this little girl in Costa Rica gets bitten by a raptor and a baby gets its face bitten off by a raptor and a construction worker gets killed by a raptor and then you hear about the hupia. These stories are all told at the very beginning of the book as there own story. It jumps around to much. The best part of the book is the end when they leave the island because Jurassic Park failed to be successful. They learned there lesson for messing with nature and for being stupid enough to pick DNA from frogs that can change their sex."
3,jarassic park,"this book was good when using your imagination, but then comes the movies and they mess up your image and distort your ideas,great job but films made it look better"
3,Ordinary,"Certainly nowhere near Crichton's best work. It was mediocreat best and highly predictable. It is however, a heck of a lot betterthan the movie which was embarrasingly awful. No wonder it became our biggest blockbuster ever!"
5,Jurassic Parks 400 Pages Of Encyclopedia,If You Were Able To Make A 400 Page Encyclopedia Of All Of the Dinosaurs In Jurassic Park and Get It Published By 2006 or 2007 that Would be great! Please I Really want to Learn More About Jurassic Park.P.S. I love to draw them.
5,"This is one of those,""Oh my god I cant put this down"" Books.","I'm Matt McGovern, 12 years old from Louisiana. I read this about a week ago and i was astounded.I was thinking, you know: With this stuff on the market, why the hell is RL Stine getting so much credit! You know?"
4,A Very Important Work in the Realm of Hard S.F.,"The embodiment of Hard Science is in a character in J.P. named Ian Malcom whose farsightedness is a pure delight whenever he speaks in the novel. I especially enjoyed his, ""..life will find a way.."" speech. The plot is a tightly wound ball of string that as you read on begins to unravel until everything and everyone is engulfed in utter chaos. Another of Malcom's enjoyable speeches is on the nature of chaos. A very important work, that should have won a pulitzer. A little different from my style, though, so four instead of five stars will do."
4,Detailed. Exciting. Thrilling.,"This story is detailed and compelling. It is a tale of science being taken too far, a cautionary tale, to be sure. A good read."
4,Watch Out Dino!,After seeing the movie numerous times I didn't really want to read the book because I thought that it would be almost exactly like the movie. How wrong I was. The book and the movie are similar but different in enough ways to make reading the book a different experience. If you have seen the movie and liked it read the book and you'll wish it had become the movie. I thought it was strange that Jurassic Park 3 used a variation of the pteridactyl part from the original Jurassic Park book. I guess they realized they shouldn't have left it out in the first movie after all. Great book!
5,Jedi Girl Takes a Bite Out of Jurassic Park,"Cloning Dinosaurs used to be just a figment in the imagination for some little kid. Well not any more, John Hammond has used all of his power and money to create the best living Attraction Park in the history of mankind. When the park is about to open, Hammond brings some of the greatest in the fields of paleontology, palobotany, and mathematicians to sign off on the park, when their weekend get away turns into a tragic massacre. Of the 12 main characters about 6 make it off the island and they are faced with answering questions from to government about the park. This is probably the second best book that I have ever read. I just can't put it down until I've read the whole thing. Michael Crichton has a way with words that will just keep you riveted to your chair. If you liked the movie then you will love the book. So take this journey into your imagination the minute you ""step"" into Jurassic Park.Science Fiction"
5,One of the best Michael Crichton books ever!,"In comparing this book to others in the same genre it is difficult to not find it spectacular. The characters are well developed, the story is plausable to the genre and the era it is set in, and this book has a message. The author tells a story that has meaning down to this day. What better way for a book to last if it can be used and enjoyed for generations? Superb work by Crichton and should be considered one of the greatest sci-fi books of our lifetime."
5,Not Free SF Reader,"If you resurrect dinosaurs, use fully original product.Crichton takes an idea based on Robert Bakker's research and theories on warm blooded, quicker dinosaurs and builds a novel around it.He does a fine job too on the story of an entrepreneur wanting to make a theme park with real live dinosaurs.A party of scientist experts are invited to look over the facilities on the small island he is using, and because this is a thriller, things get chaotic.Some fine dinosaur work, and may get some people interested in actual palaeontology.4.5 out of 5"
4,Very good - with a few exceptions!,"I liked this book alot - it was hard to put down and was very informative. The plot hooks you, and it's nice to read, AND the characters are likable (especially Malcom!)... however, there are a few lingering questions. 1. Why didn't the verlarsaraptors (spelled wrong, probably) excape the first time? 2. Why was visiting the verlarsaraptor's nest non-dangerous? It appeared added at the end of the book with little explanation and little danger (it would seem to be the most dangerous)!Other than that, a great book!"
3,"Great premise, but disappointing","The revolutionary premise of this suspenseful adventure yarn is sadly watered down with cardboard characters, thin prose, and a predictable plot. The novel is much more gruesome than Spielberg's ""family-friendly"" adaptation."
2,Exception to the rule,"9/10 books I read are better than the movie, but this is one rare case that I believe the opposite. The book is mostly slowed down by the excessive scientific discussions. It's not so much the conversations I don't like; it's when they have them. I also think that the characters make really dumb decisions; a prime example is late in the book, when Grant and the rest escape from the visitor's center and a helicopter is on it's way, they decide to 'check out' the raptor breeding grounds. Can't they wait an hour? Have they not put their lives on the line enough?? Surveying a nest of deadly predators that have been trying to kill me for the last twelve chapters would be the LAST thing I do! If you want excitement, watch Jurassic Park the movie. Or if you prefer reading, Lost World, which is the Jurassic Park sequel, is much better."
5,hmmmm...,"i was gonna give 4 stars. because i knew too much about the story. i saw the movie like 6 years ago, and now i read the book. if i hadn't seen the movie, the book would have been very very interesting. it had a lot of scientific stuffs unlike the moive. and......i liked it."
3,"Good, but worst than the movie","I though Jurassic Park was a good book, making me read through it in less than a week. For a 400 page book, that's not a long time. It's got a lot more science than the movie, and that is the best characteristic of the book, making you learn a bunch of new stuff. It's even fun and interesting if you don't like science, like me. But the ""action"" parts are too long and it doesn't have the magic the movie has. Even so, it's good entertainment and a very good book."
5,What can I say that hasnt been said already.Its a masterpice,"What can i say, it's the best book ever written. A must read."
4,VEEERRRYY GOOD,"I think Michael Crichton did very well writing the facts on this book. He also fit in funny, smart, and a action packed summary. (I would of put 4 and a half but it won't let me!)"
4,Fasinating Book,"This book was about a man who wanted a to build a park...Jurassic Park. A rich seventy year old man named John Hammond wanted to build a childs theme park with none other than dinosaurs. The main character is a paloetologist named Alan Grant. The book takes place on an island 100 miles off the coast of Costa Rica. The island turns bad when a storm hits the island knocking down power, and the electric fences. I thought the story was really good, and I really liked it."
5,Excellent novel,"Crichton does it again with another great book. This has to be one of the greatest books I have ever read. There are almost no words to describe it. If you saw the movie, pick this book up. If you did not, pick this book up. If you do not even like dinosaurs get this book. The amount of time Crichton puts into his work is amazing. The only thing I can say is if you read this, do not read the sequel. It is not nearly as good, and it is a sequel to the movie not the book. Overall, this will keep you reading from cover to cover nonstop."
4,Jurassic Park,"This bok is a bloody, gory, action packed bool about a real dinosaur park gone bad, written by Michael Crichton. I recommend this book to anyone who who is seeking an action packed, keep you begging for more book.A generoouse scientist uses ancient dinosaur DNA extracted from petrified mosquitoes to clone real life dinosaurs in the hope of making it a park ten times better than Disney Land, or Universal Studios. Humans and pre historic beasts can collide safley, or is it safe? that's what a group of inspectors are their to find out, They find out alright."
4,Better than the movie for sure,"Ok, you saw the movie and were ""wow-ed"" by the animation. The book is so much better! The scenes that never made it to the silver screen are so darn good that if for no other reason they alone would justify reading this book.4 Stars, not 5 ... why? Well, I like self motivated fully developed characters. Mr. Crichton simply puts some characters in the book to fill a single role and then they're gone. Too cookie cutter for me, but then again, the action scenes are out of this world."
5,And I thought the movie ruled!,"Ok, to start off with, the movie ruled. I mean, who couldn't love a movie that major hunk Jeff Goldblum was in? Well, that isn't the only reason I loved the movie, but, hey, I just had to put that in! Then, there's the novel. It was the coolest! It ruled!"
4,Great book!,"I have been a fan of the movies since they came out and have them memorized. That said, the book read a lot different than the movies, for which I am glad. I knew the book would be different but didn't see a need to read it. Am I glad I did. The typos are throughout, just a little FYI. But all in all, a great book to sit and relax with. I was asked which I liked better, the movie or the book. The movie seemed a bit campy and the book edgier. I have no preference, but am glad I took the time to finally read this one."
4,So Tell Me - Does Michael Crichton Hate Technology or...,"...does he love it?This book stages a number of dialogues about the role science and technology should play in our world. The outcomes of those debates are really left to us, the readers. This is one of the best things about Crichton's writing - he lets us decide.But I say he's definitely biased. Based on this book and others, especially ""The Andromeda Strain,"" he believes that the exploitation of tehcnology for commercial purpose is wrong, which is really nuts when you think about it. If we did not ""exploit"" advances in science and technology, they would stop happening.At least I'd argue that we would never have the stuff Crichton writes about so enthusiastically. All science has progressed through commercial or governmental patronage; pure science is an inevitable parasite regarded as necessary."
5,What an amazing novel!,"When I first heard what this novel was about, I thought it would be horrible. I was amazed!I loved the plot! The characters were amazing, and the plot went so deep that it got me entrenched! I read the whole book in one long sit, and could not bare to put it down!This was one of the best novels I have ever read, and every novel reader should spend a few hours enjoying one of Michael Crichton's best works!"
5,Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton is the greatest book!,"Recently I read Michael Crichton's Jurassic Park. I just wanted to say that I consider it one of the greatest literary works of all time. The plot is fascinating. Once you start it you won't be able to stop until you're through. His characters are three dimensional, and the entire work is full of suspense, excitment, and creativity."
5,Amazing Book,"One of the best books I've ever read. Crichton masterfully captures the essence of each character and vividly describes the dinosaurs, without taking away form the readers own imagination. Scientific facts are incredibly detailed. There are many characters but Crichton manages to develop each one."
5,Audio cassettes are still great,Audio cassettes are still wonderful for the drive to work every. I really love the detail that Michael Crichton puts into his books.I bought this used and it was in perfect shape.
3,"Not a bad story, but beware the factual errors...","Michael Crichton is undeniably an addictive author, but in all honesty, this book lacked some important factors. Clever though Ian Malcolm may be, he rarely predicts anything the reader hadn't predicted three pages beforehand, and several of the supporting characters are intolerably wooden. From a palaeontological perspective, the book is a loss. That Spielberg based his film upon Crichton's template was insult upon injury. Velociraptor mongoliensis was merely fifty centimetres tall, and Dilophosaurus wetherilli, devoid of hollow teeth, spat no poisons. I could almost forgive his factual errors had he not brandished them all over the sequel, The Lost World. I'm left to wonder what errors existed in other novels, on other scientific topics. All in all, I think Jurassic Park is worth a look--just don't believe everything you read. --Darren Jame"
3,mixed feelings,"I picked JP from a used book pile, I had never seen any of the JP movies or read anything by Michael Crichton. The premise is great. Modern day dino's terrorizing a remote island. The book was half exciting, half a challenge to get through. I wasn't buying all of it sometimes which made it hard to read, and the technical stuff got to be too much (a complaint I've read in other reviews of Crichton works). All in all mixed feelings about this one."
5,This book is fantastic!,This book has it all. It is imaginative and compeling. A must read! I have read all of Michael Crichton's books and by far this is the best one.
4,Park it,Jurassic Park is one of the better sci-fi books from a notable sci-fi author. It has deep roots in dinosaurs and exo-laboratory adventure. The technological devices and theoretical plots synthesizes prize in this bestselling novel. There are points when you feel velociraptors breathing down your neck and smell dew on leaves of deadly plants. Yellow frogs are the last thing you will be worrying about.
