5,Great Movie,"This was a great movie. Not just a christmas movie, but one with a little romantic twist. I enjoyed it!!!"
3,romantic comedy + Christmas movie = cliches,"I've watched a lot of Christmas movies and romantic comedies with my wife. A Christmas Kiss is basically a mashup of the two genres. It's not badly done. The acting is fine, the production much better than the typical made-for-TV movie, and the plot isn't completely mindless. However, the movie is overflowing with cliches, almost to the point of suffocation. The plot was entirely predictable from scene 1. The protagonist is filled with holiday cheer while her boss is essentially a grinch. If you need something to watch while you cuddle with your significant other during the holidays, this movie will probably work, but I'm just tired of the utter lack of originality in these types of films."
4,"Good, but not their best","The day the Star Room Boys called it quits was the worst day for music in the last few years. Bless these boys.This isn't as great as their debut, though. While ""Cocaine Parties"" and a few other tracks are as heart-breaking as country can get, it doesn't have the relentless excellence as ""Lonely Men and Women.""I remember attending the release show for this ... what a great live act the SRBs were. If you like good, old-timey, heartfelt country, get this ... but not before you own their brilliant debut."
4,Adieu Star Room Boys,"An excellent follow-up to their first disc, only this time Marr sings as though he's not feeling the heartache of the first album. A couple of more uptempo songs (see ""Daydreamer"" - complete w/ sing-along vocal harmony) distinguish this album from ""Why Do Loneley Men & Women..."" and make it a little more boot-shufflin' and less and less ""crying in your PBR."" Still, they're the same old Star Room Boys and half the songs on there will have you hangin your head and remembering love lost at night's end. I personally think their rookie effort was more powerful and would reccommend this disc as a supplement to it rather than it being the only purchase of a first-time SRB listener. These guys are great to see live, unfortunateley they've recently disbanded. Cheers to Dave, John and the rest of the fellas. I've enjoyed the music the past few years and will cherish these 2 albums for years to come."
4,"Moody and smoky, somewhere between trance and 80s rock.","This Hungarian band's CD is one of the most unique I have encountered. Except for the ""screaming chorus"" on one track, the album is entirely instrumental. The guitars give a sound that edges towards bad metal, but stays far enough away to avoid unpleasantness, and mostly add a somewhat nervous tone to the music. The rhythmic structure is minimalist, but varied enough to keep interest.The name translates from Hungarian to ""one and a half."" Another similar Hungarian band is Korai Orom, who tend to be more abstract."
1,So Close but so Far,"The director's interview is perhaps one of the most memorable I've seen because it makes clear in director Jeff Maccubbin's own words the degree to which this film is a mirror to his own psychiatrically disordered life. The isolation, drug use, and self destructive behavior we see in INTO IT are as much the director's as the characters in the film. A reasonable hope is that with the new, cheaper, but higher quality film making equipment available to beginners, Maccubbin will refine his understanding of the art of telling a story without the self-indulgent camera tricks, lack of focus and jumpy editing which eventually sink this effort. The guy has the creativity but whether he can acquire the hard headed practicality crucial to keeping his audience with him is yet to be seen.Own it? No. But if you are a cinema student, this would make a great study in beginner's land mines, not to mention the basis for a slew of film school discussions."
1,Lousy product,This product was defective out of the flimsy envelope it arrived in. It did not work at all.
2,Pobre desempe√±o,"Este producto promete mucho, pero la verdad cuando maneja muchos archivos se vuelve muy lento inclusive parece que se ha trabado. No lo recomiendo."
2,Worse Book On Race Matters,"I didn't buy this book from Amazon.com but was a bit stupid and bought it from a regular bookstore. My mistake but really this is not a very good book and to say it's ""analytical"" is to overlook most of it's major flaws. It's overview of the Civil Rights Movement is too general, excluding in particular Malcolm X who I suppose was just an angry black man and for some crazy reason saw ""devils"" everywhere. But Dr. King Jr. is mentioned up and down, not as an activist as he truly was but as a humble, pacifist who begged racists to change their ways.I found this book to kind of an insult considering that there were more African Americans involved in the Civil Rights Movement and that most of us were not passive agents, waiting for Dr. King to have his ""dream"". The authors should have done a more in depth study instead of this elementary effort."
5,A Wonderful Evening,"This is a wonderful cd! I had the pleasure of seeing the opening performance of this show, then titled ""And then there's Bea,"" at the Guthrie Theatre in Minneapolis. This had to be one of the most relaxing, joyous evenings I've had in a long time. The entire audience was amazed at how captivating she was and after she fell off the stage she got helped back on and continued without skipping a beat! Truly amazing. The only disappointment about this cd is that it is very much toned down from the raunchy humor Ms. Arthur is known for and the songs I most wanted to hear from the production are missing from this recording (Garbage, and Times, They Are A Changing). This show really isn't a biography but more of a conversation you may hear at a dinner party, and a dinner party where everything is discussed!"
2,She's No Elaine Stritch,"Seeing Bea on Broadway pales in comparison to Elaine Stritch's one-woman show, ""At Liberty"". But we're not here to review the show, only the recording. And again, this recording pales next to the 2-disc set that captures the ENTIRE Stritch performance. This 1-cd recording captures a good deal of Bea's rather pat, pre-digested self-congratulatory performance, but missing is perhaps the funniest section of the show, her Sophie Tucker routine and the hilarious Tucker song, ""You've Got To Stay Young To Be Healthy (And I'm the Healthiest Gal in Town""). The others numbers performed are all right, but for someone who so adores Lotte Lenya and that lady's unique performance style (Lenya did volumes with a very limited instrument), Bea just doesn't show that she learned enough of Lenya's technique all that time they shared a dressing room doing ""The Threepenny Opera"". The recording, like the show, is a disappointment."
2,"Disappointing, alas!","I really wanted to like this CD - as I was growing up, Bea Arthur as MAUDE was a heroine to me - tall and sassy and in-your-face, with charm and tenderness and talent. Sadly, few of those qualities are in evidence here, overshadowed as they are by her ceaseless name-dropping, tired jokes and bellowing singing voice. On the up-side, the recording is clean, the piano in tune (even if Bea isn't!) and a few of the songs actually WORK for Bea's persona, but she doesn't have the pipes to really SELL 'em! The patter is pretty cliched - no surprises nor strokes of brilliant insight. She comes off as a shallow performer, merely going through the motions - not the enlightened human being I'd assumed she'd be by now. I'd hoped for something REAL, and what I got was the same old razzmatazz showbiz BS."
5,The Eternal Entertainer,"She was at the top of her game - endearing, so talented and a pure joy to watch."
4,"Well done, Bea.","The late Bea Arthur is captured just as she would have liked (I assume since it was taped live on stage). At least ""I"" cerainly liked the recording. Her humor is supurb and this disc has just the right mix of humorous anecdotes and songs performed only as she could do them. I would have loved to see her in a live performance. As it is, this is the next best thing!"
1,Not sure what this fits,"Part wasn't what I expected to get. Looked way different. Okay maybeit is an aftermarket part by the way. Well turns out no way does it fit.Returning for credit to seller, what a real hassle. Didn't bother, glad theydidn't cost much. Tossed them out."
3,I reused my OEM boot,"I bought this boot to replace the OEM boot and shocks on my 2007 Aveo sedan. I was already replacing the stock springs with H&R sport lowering springs so I bought the 343423 KYB GR-2 shocks to improve the ride and the boots to match. OR SO I THOUGHT! I contacted KYB to ensure compatibility before I purchased and the customer service rep confirmed. However, when I received the boot, the bump stop that the boot came wouldn't work unless I was willing to cut it and the quality of the boot itself didn't impress me, either. The bump stop covered ALL the threads I needed to attached the shock mount!! and the same happened when I replaced the front struts too! luckily the OEM boot was still reusable! I rated the SB107 three stars because it seemed like if I was willing to modify the the bump stop and WASN'T lowering my car it might have worked out."
1,Does not fit 2006 Chevy Aveo regardless of KYB catalog,"I bought this along with the KYB 343423 shock. This boot was not designed for the car. The bump stop that comes with it keeps the boot from going down further on the shock shaft and does not allow for proper installation of the shock mount. I don't know why the KYB catalog says this fits the Aveo when it clearly does not. And no, I didn't install it wrong. Reuse your old dust boot and bump stop if possible."
1,"Nice Lady, Terrible Book","I had the pleasure of meeting the author at a Borders bookstore near my home. I purchased the book because the author seemed to be a very pleasant woman. Unfortunately, I was very disappointed with the book. I found the characterizations to be shallow, almost to the point of caricature. The book was riddled with cliches. It seems that the author tried very hard to paint a positive portrayal of African Americans living in Los Angeles. In the process, she sacrificed characters with any dimension or complexity."
1,Badly done war porn.,"There are no redeeming features in this book. The prose is poorly done, the character is an unsypathetic jingoist who couldn't be less human if he tried. There is no central plot to the books and the villains are at best strawmen conjured up from whimsical fantasies of the most paranoid deluded soul. The book in and of itself basically provides justification for the worst sorts of atrocities commited. That the character could go and commit horrible atrocities and terrorist acts himself without noting the irony of every single thing he had said before is disturbing.What makes the book unforgivable is that rather than not condone the horrible crimes against humanity his character has carried out, the author goes on to defend them. This is a disgusting and abhorent cop out and a bitter irony for the book.Waste not your money on this defense of terrorism, instead look for better work."
2,"Help, I can't find Earth!","Regarding ""The Weapon"": This guy is so promising; he has most of the nuts and bolts of writing down pat -- believable character, realistic action -- but he doesn't know when enough is enough. The premise of alien moles (who are near-genius, super-trained warriors) activating when earth abuses their homeworld, that's what I'd love to read.But all the minutiae you have to wade through to get to the point where he goes to earth! I'm at page 138 and am tired of all this beautifully-described training. Worse, when I try to scan ahead for when he gets to earth, I can't find it because everything's so densely packed. If there'd just been a table of contents with three things -- prolegomena (or some catchy word for the endless buildup), mole insertion on earth, attack by earth with retaliation. But no.Somebody, please post the page number where he gets to earth. Thanks."
2,unfinished - but NOT a symphony,"I really enjoyed the first book, Freehold, but this book was so slow, dreary and stultifying that I simply could not waste any more time reading it. The protagonist is an egotistical young man who believes that he must bow to no law or authority. The story begins when he enlists in the ""army"" and goes slow step by step through just about every day of his various training roles. I was halfway through the book and still not much had happened, other than endless mind numbing details of training. Chinron's compatriots appear and soon fall by the wayside and I had great difficulty caring. The characters were stilted and uninspiring and had no depth to make the reader feel anything but indifference to their fate. If you have lots and lots of free time to plow through page after boring page, then good luck to you. But, not me. This book now goes into the give-away bin."
5,Engorged Rules!!,"Excellent album! These guys are superb at mixing Extreme Metal and Thrash Metal into one happy little ball of awesome! As a bonus, all their lyrics are based off of some of the great horror movies of yesteryear! They even throw in some of the soundtrack from the Return Of The Living Dead movie on the song dedicated to it! Absolutely epic!!"
5,"Are you, advanced, have any questions????","You can find answers for the questions ex: Which goes first NAT or routing proccess or encryption? What is throttles and why my ethernet sometimes don't response? Why my router crashes? All of this answers You can find here. If You whant to understand unix-like IOS you better read this before starting ANY development CCNA, CCNP or CCIE."
4,"Nice shelves, but expensive","Shelves arrived very fast and were able to be assembled easily. They are as advertised. Be aware the shelf backing is not hardwood, but thick paper paneling. These are sturdy shelves, but will need to be anchored to the wall or floor to be safe, especially if you have kids because they are tall. I do not believe they are worth the cost. I paid upward of two hundred fifty each. One fifty would be more reasonable."
1,Soft boots...stiff stiff zipper,"My wild land fire boots are broken in. When I added this hard piece of PVC, ridiculous ! Doesn't move or twist with the boot. On even a short march I would be hatin it as I can feel pressure spots with any movement"
2,Stolid second effort from awesome guitarist,"After his debut effort Tamas produced this somewhat overwrought album - aiming for more feeling in the music but falling a little short. Hard denying the talent on display but this is probably one for guitar maniacs only.Given the brevity of the above review I'll quickly mention that Tamas has a bunch of instrumental albums out. Beware. An album called Guitarhits has the same track listing as Guitar Hardware I. Trust me on this. G/Hardware has a couple of flying V's with their necks crossed with lightning in the background etc. Guitarhits has our hero sitting with a couple of guitars on a plain white background. That's the only difference really.Also, for something slightly more restrained than this but still in a rock vein you could try to track down King Street Blues which is kinda cool but hard to find."
5,Music to wallow in.,"As a die hard ""Slowdive"" fan, the transition to ""Mojave 3"" (I thought) would be hard to stomach. While I really enjoyed ""Out of Tune"" I couldnt help shake that ""Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young"" throwback vibe. ""Excuses for Travelers"" shows a maturity and self-identity that the last album seemed to lack. I really, really dig this album. I was recently vacationing on the ""Isle of Skye"" in Scotland. Driving around that beautifull place while listening to this CD (especially the track ""My life in Art"") was almost a relegious experience. This is truly a great CD and should not be missed. The ironic thing is that Mr. Halstead paints (to me at least) more of an ""American"" picture on some songs that our own countrymen only wish they could."
5,I cant stop listening to it,"This is a remarkable CD. I love every song and I can't help but listen to this cd almost every day. Its perfect for any time of day. The songs that stick out for me are ""In Love with a View,"" ""My life in Art,"" ""Return to Sender,"" and ""When You're Drifting"" though every song is beautiful and worth your time. It is one of cd's that I listen to the most even though I haven't listen to much of the other works by Halstead. But I assure you that even if you're not a fan of slowdive or even Rock and Roll, this CD will make you feel good and it will be one of your favorites. It is one of those CDs that you make sure your friends and family listen to intently to make sure they hear all the amazing sounds that Mojave 3 make on this album. Do yourself a favor and buy the album. It's worth whatever you have in your wallet."
5,Excuses for travelling!,"The music of Mojave 3 makes you chill out in your sofa such as walk through the beautiful Rio de Janeiro ""in love with a view"". it's Definitely worth every cent spent and months of delay until the cd could be found here. Neil Halstead's voice could not be more appropriated, such as the album title ""Excuses for travellers"" for a perfect driving, on a long trip through beautiful scenarios. Maybe the green and sunny England in summer time, maybe the Mojave desert. Inspiring for poets and ordinary people as well."
5,Bittersweet sunshine pop,"I think Pitchfork gave this a 5.5 rating. Silly Pitchfork...No, this record won't change the world, but it is achingly lovely. It will make you think of the end of summer, dappled sunlight though trees, saying goodbye, lonely beaches and longing to be somewhere you're not, in much the same way as those swelling strings do in Buffalo Springfield's ""Expecting to Fly.""That they are an English band playing music influenced by American country-folk-pop makes their portrayal of our country's high lonesome spaces all the more vivid and picturesque."
4,Mojave 3: Any Day will be Fine!,"I have been a 4ad fan since the early 80's. Mojave 3 is one of the label's current jewels, along with Gus Gus, Lisa Germano, and Thievery Corporation. My favorite tracks off of their latest album are: Anyday will be Fine, My Life in Art, In Love with a View, and Return to Sender. My only wish for this album is more vocals by Rachel! I also just saw them live--they were phenomenal!"
2,How the mighty have fallen!,"My oh my...Neil Halstead, what have you been smoking? The change from Slowdive to Mojave 3 was drastic, but tolerable. I enjoyed Ask Me Tomorrow, though I'd much rather have heard another outing in the vein of Slowdive. Out of Tune, was hit or miss. The first few songs hit, the last several were definite misses that seemingly spiraled out of control and landed Mojave 3 into this heap of garbage called 'Excuses For Travelers'. Which is a horrid gathering of 12 poor 'Excuses For' songs. Listen to Neil sing out of key. Listen to him recycle riffs. This is simply a sorry attempt from a once great musician. Do not forsake the wonderfully lush atmospheres of Slowdive for this rediculas Bob Dylan incarnate."
1,Looking for wristmobile,I need to know more about your wristmobile from Do Co Mo Japanese company please answer me because Im planning to buy it ....Thank you .
3,"Not great, not technical","This book was not exactly what I expected, and perhaps I was disappointed in that regard--It did not have any technical description of i-mode or the Japanese mobile web. It was a bit thin and weak in the sense of giving a reader a clear picture of i-mode.It's 'I know Japan so well that I don't need to write very well' attitude rather grated on me, and after a couple hundred pages actually had the effect of making stop read the book."
1,It's a dud!,I thought this would be a neat toy for my 2 kids who like art. Two of the markers were competely dry and the others didn't work very well. It's a dud.
3,confusing,"i am a fan of the cronos-era venom. as many are aware, venom acquired the services of 'the demolitian man' after cronos departed in the wake of 'calm before the storm'. this disc seems to be billed as a sort of overview of the band, yet virtually all of the tracks feature their latter-day vocalist. i had been somehow led to believe that 'court of death' contained unreleased cronos-era songs. the liner notes are (intentionally) vague, and, i suspect, the release is exploitative -no doubt trotted out to capitalize on the new album ""Resurrection,' featuring the original line-up. can anyone provide actual song-by-song details for this cd? it would be much appreciated. it is likely that cronos appears on a track or two, but i'd like to be sure..."
2,Let's Do the Time Warp Again,"I bought this on vinyl as a teen in 1977. With lines like, ""my macho muchacho, come on let's boogie!"" this album is a relic of the late 70s excess that spawned Studio 54, heavy drug use and disco. Later in '77, the classic Saturday Night Fever soundtrack came out. Stick with that one. Liza Minnelli is an amazing talent. If you want to hear something good from this time frame, get the soundtrack of ""New York, New York,"" or her Broadway show The Act."""
5,Totally Awesome!,"I did a Summer School class on building Zome for four weeks. You might think that an hour a day for four weeks would make it seem pretty boring- But it wasn't! One day we had to build a bridge that would support 2 1/2 pounds and have a shoe box pass under it. Then, for the finals we had to balanceeven more weight- and it worked!It's amazing how struts (the sticks) and nodes (the balls) fit together PERFECTLY! You can make cool things like bubble Blowersout of them!All in all, this is the best building projects out of all!"
5,Over and Above History Class,"When I was in school, General Sherman was underrated. Sure, we'd spend about 20 minutes talking about him and his march through the south but it was so incomplete it was almost worthless to talk about him as the lessons didn't really reveal much of anything.I'd love to go back and get my history teachers to show this. It's a great look at not only a key figure in the civil war but it also has a lot of good information on the war in general. It squashes a lot of myths and rumors in regards to Sherman (one example is that he targeted supply lines and buildings, not innocent people like many think). If you have any interest in the civil war, I recommend taking the time to watch this."
4,Fine reenactment of pivotal event from the Civil War,"The History Channel presents a very good documentary about Sherman's march to the sea, which hastened the end of the Civil War. It includes archival footage, maps, and the requisite talking heads, but for the most part consists of a very high quality reenactment of the events. Although he doesn't have many lines of dialogue, Bill Oberst, Jr. makes a sympathetic Sherman, which won't please Southern partisans who still nurse grudges from over a hundred years ago. This approach results in a program that dispenses information without becoming a dry recitation of facts and even has few moments that are quite moving, something I wasn't expecting from a history documentary."
3,Sherman's March,"Sherman's March was done with typical political spin fasion. This documentary portrays Sherman as a hero, when in reality he was a mass murduring marauding psycopath that should have been tried and hung for war crimes. They even put in some of the same old dribble about how the Civil War (War of Northern Aggression) was supposidly all about slavery, when in fact it was all about state's rights and the infringment of constitutional rights by an illegal National Government getting way too big !Jim, Carmel IndianaThe History Channel Presents Sherman's March"
4,Sherman's March,"Good acting. Makes one understand what was meant by ""total war"". It gave me some insight into General Sherman's character as he led his troop through the state of Georgia all the way to Atlanta. He brought the realities and horror of war to,the civilian population of this state."
5,Sherman's March,"I found this documentary to be informative and well-done. It explains well Sherman's motives for making his ""march to the sea"", even though the devastation was of course tremendous."
5,Interesting read!,"Very interesting read about this famous ""March To The Sea"" with great detail as to how it was accomplished and what happened along the way. It was a real challenge met by troops who were already battle weary but who gave their all to accomplish the goal."
2,Fails to Deliver on Interesting Idea,"It was an interesting concept, but a bit overwritten. There were sections that were filled with either exposition or abstract language, which ground the story's progression to a near standstill. Reading it on my Kindle, I couldn't believe that when the story arc seemed over, I still had about 25% of the book left to read.The most interesting character (to me) was the antagonist, Harmon Jacques, but he was mostly faded out in favor of Richard Nixon in sequences which bordered on bizarre.I can't say I enjoyed the book enough to justify suggesting it to anyone. I read it in a little over a day, but I was driven as much by just wanting to finish it as the slim hope that it would improve at some point.Most of all, I was disappointed by the relative lack of depth portrayed for what seemed like an interesting concept in the form of the ""Imagoes."" In the end, it seemed like a fairly superficial title for a way that a dead character can interact with the living."
3,One interesting character,"The story was improbable at times (no backups? Entire cities across the country relying heavily on a single computer system in California for everything, one that no one seems to understand?). Two of the virtual characters were interesting (although one wasn't developed much) but the real people seemed less three dimensional than the virtual and were simply very bad, or very good. The adventure was ok, not breaking new ground and not entirely unpredictable with a mild anti-climactic resolution. There were some fascinating concepts introduced that weren't really explored.Greg Bear's ""Darwin's Radio"" covered this ground (mutating people, fear and prejudice, etc.) but without the Imagos.I would hesitate to recommend this book to friends but I'm interested in seeing what else the author writes. If another book truly revolved around the Imagoes and their world, I'd be interested in reading it."
2,"""Imago"" Was Okay, But Lacked Focus, Polish","After reading Amy Casil's ""Without Absolution"" (a passable first novel, if a bit rough) I had expected ""Imago"" to be a more polished work. Sadly, ""Imago"" just doesn't deliver the goods. The main character, Harman Jacques, just isn't very believable, and that seriously cripples the overall novel. And though the idea of PerfectTown was the best part of the book, in the hands of a more skillful writer it could have been much more cleverly done. Still, ""Imago"" tries hard, and the reincarnation of Richard Nixon was a neat idea. No cigars for this effort, so two shiny stars will just have to do."
2,montana girl,not as great as what i thought. not very comfortable pretty very heavy. Didnt quite look like the photo online.
5,"Surf is way, way, way up for this flick...","I ran into this movie by chance, I had a great time watching it. Reviewer, Dennis Amith, has a great little write up of this flick if you want a run down. All I can add is, grab a beer and roll em, because it's all about great tunes with up-close view of a guy hanging it out there. Rock on."
3,muffler,after installation I ran it for a month an it started to viberate...kept checking and it was the heat sheild wasn't welded tight I had to crease the sheild to stop noise....
5,Works for Working Dad's too,"I'm a single dad with Sole Custody.This book helped me focus, and approach work place issues with new confidence and success. I found it as applicable to working dad's as it is to working moms."
5,Excellent book for use in classroom teaching of Ancient Maya,"I teach sixth grade and use The Corn Grows Ripe in my classroom. I teach a unit on the Ancient Mayans. This book is a great teaching tool. Not only do the students learn about the customs and family life of the Ancient Maya, but they also learn some of the Spanish language as well. We create a Spanish dictionary while reading the book. Good easy-read for all levels of readers in your classroom."
2,Corn Grows Ripe,"For a school project I read The Corn Grows Ripe by Dorothy Rhoads. This book was not the best book I have ever read, but it was still OK. The book was very childish and short. The Plot was not too great; it was about a Mayan family that could not grow the corn because the father was injured. So the 12 year old boy Tigre has to grow the corn this season, or the family will starve. The book did not give enough information about the characters. The reader would have to figure out the personality of the character as the book goes on. The setting takes place in a small Mayan town in modern times, the book would be much better if it would take place in the classic Mayan times. I would give this book 2 stars out of 5ive. And would recommend the age group of 7-10 years."
5,"Yes, I recommend it.","Someone told me about this book when I was going through a hard time with believing. I'm not the kind to read cover-to-cover. Usually, I flip through the book, and see what catches my eye.This book answered so many questions for me that I did not even know how to ask."
4,Good product for the price,"As other reviewers have mentioned, this is a good product at this price point. The casting does have some rough edges that I knocked down with a metal file. I am using this step pulley to replace a missing one on a 1970s era craftsman wood lathe. This seller shipped the part super fast. Amazon estimated a week and a half for the item to leave the seller. It showed up fedex at my door in four days (three business days), and that was standard shipping! I would recommend this product and the seller strongly."
2,It's a four step pulley alright!,"This pulley is a 2"", 2 1/2"", 3 1/2"", 4"" with a 5/8"" shaft and 3/16 key. I would have liked to see a pulley with an even range of sizes. It will run my tool fast or slow. I would have liked a little more middle range in the speed. Had to file some sharp edges where the belt runs. I guess you get what you pay for. It will work until I get a better one."
1,Attractive but not functional,"This dispenser has a strong resistance and makes it difficult to pull back the lever with the thumb. When it closes, it tends to leave behind a drop of syrup that can run down the side."
1,pretty awful...,"I bought 2 of these dispensers, one for syrup and one for honey. The dispenser is too stiff for children to use, and while the syrup moves quite freely, it takes hours for honey to pour. It makes for a sticky mess. Definitely not worth having."
3,Not bad for the price,Durable and functional with easy clean up simply under hot running water. BUT . . . the resistance on the pouring spout lever is really stiff as other reviewer mentioned - anyone with arthritis or other thumb problem would not be pleased. Just wipe the little drip left over away when you're finished pouring and you won't have a sticky mess down the side ;-) For the price including super saver shipping - generally very pleased.
1,"Expensive, leaky, and not unbreakable.","I bought 20 of these for my restaurant because of the description and how attractive they are.They're awful.I paid $10 APIECE for these. They all leak. Every single one of them. And, what's odd, they leak out the back of the dispenser, down the handle. The servers have dropped a few of them and, guess what? They break on impact, just like glass.These are the best-looking syrup dispensers I've ever seen, but they're way too expensive and don't live up to the false description whatsoever. What a shame."
4,Smokin' Live Album,"Despite what anyone says, this is the one Curved Air album to buy. In the studio they always sounded more than just a little timid and underproduced, but live they cut loose. Sonja Kristina's vocals are like an unleashed screamin' demon(well maybe like a more British Ann Wilson crossed with the arti-ness of Peter Hammill)especially on my favorite cuts ""It Happened Today"" and ""Marie Antoinette"".Daryl Way is one of the greatests violinists you will hear. If you are a fan of 70's progressive you'll be amazed by this record."
3,In pine effect,"This album features songs from Curved Air's first three albums, including classic songs like ""Vivaldi"" and ""Back street luv"". Curved Air offered a harder rocking sound on stage, and all in all, this album is more satisfying than their often very slick studio efforts. However, there's also an album available called ""Live at the BBC"". This is probably a better purchase because there are much more songs on this disc, even some pieces from Curved Air's later-era albums ""Midnight wire"" and ""Airborne""."
3,"Interesting, but studio versions are better","This is a good representation of how the band sounded live back in the mid 70's. There is a decent balance of songs off their first three albums, but it would have been good to have expanded it to a double-album.The songs are generally heavier than the studio versions. On the good side, the songs are somewhat rearranged, so the listener gets something new. On the down side, the recording quality is a bit raw, loosing the polish that makes the studio versions sound much better in contrast. Sonja Kristina, though a great singer, tends to over-exaggerate the vocals in this live setting, for added emphasis. Although this might have seemed like a good idea at the time, it unfortunately makes her singing a bit annoying. She does a much better job on the studio albums.This is still a must for Curved Air fans. For those new to the band, I'd recommend their first two albums instead (Air Conditioning and Second Album)."
5,curved air live,"I""m extremely biased when it comes to curved air. I grew up in the sixties and seventies and Marie Antoinette has always been a favorite. On the technical side, it's a great recording of a great set. A must for any fan."
2,Didn't Match,"I bought this spoon to match the Corelle Coordinates Teakettle but the base color didn't match. The spoon rest was a creamy/yellowish & the teakettle was white. They look terrible together on the stove, so I'm giving it to my mother as a stocking stuffer."
3,plastic,This is plastic. I have a porcelin i bought few years back. I guess they don't make them anymore
3,"Good ending, slow middle","This is a short and punchy SF novel which must've been geared towards the ""young adult"" crowd. The relationships between the main character and especially women are pretty simplistic. The shortness does make the characterizations suffer and I did find that the middle grew tedious. But, unlike another reviewer, I found the ending actually redeems it. The author takes his time lifting the curtain from Pol's eyes but it really feels justified. Yes, it really is like a lot of Sci Fi out there, omnipotent future societes, trained killing machine with a heart of gold...but it isn't a waste of time and in a genre full of duds, this does turn out to be a winner."
2,"Religious, but not very deep.","A thought-provoking book about one of the more interesting figures in U.S. history. However one might argue that his support of slavery, the needless misery and suffering caused by his refusal to call for an end to the war after his surrender when he admitted all was lost (basically a matter of protocol, due to loyalty to Jefferson Davis), his refusal to allow prisoner exchanges because of the Union's demand that black soldiers be included ('those species of property' as he put it) tempers the urge to consider him the ""embodiment of all that is noble, beautiful, and worthy of emulation in the best of the Christian tradition."" One would consider the Christian tradition a bit more enlightened. I also wish the author would have included the words Lee spoke when he shook hands with Ely Parker, one of Grant's aides, after the surrender papers were signed at Appomattox Courthouse: ""I am glad to see one real American here."" Parker responded, ""We are all Americans."""
2,Not very helpful. Not recommended at all.,"This book just wasn't very helpful. Not much depth, sparse, sporadic. Everytime I ran into a JSTL issue/question on my project I ran to this book hoping that maybe this time it would provide answers. It never did. Very disappointing and frustrating. Look somewhere else."
2,Shallow,"This book is potentially promising.Short, concise, inexpensive. Can it be possible?Not really.The author skirts the major issues of getting started, forwarding readers to the 'easy installation instructions' on the Jakarta site, on all matters trivial and not so trivial.The content itself is mediocre at best, written offhand and leaves you reading and re-reading every section to check whether you missed something when there really was very little there to begin with.This book smells of a rush-to-publish and under-editting and under-testing. Steer clear."
4,Hi-Lo's Do Bossa Nova,Lively harmony set to bossa nova. Pure enjoyment.The folk song section was okay. I am not a lover of Folk but enjoy most standards.
4,Great reading,"Owning a summer home that has been purchased from an extended family, the story is so familiar, but I could never tell it as George Colt has told it. I gave it four stars because I think you have to have lived the experience to appreciate the subtle touches in the story."
1,Beyond Boring,"This is probably the most boring, superficial, self-serving book I've read in years. Its title should really be WHO CARES? because that really sums up this tedious, endless tale of a family you don't really care about after 327 pages, mainly because they're all so uninteresting, or at least he makes them that way. And who cares about the details of selling this ridiculous house? Not to mention that the author is so consumed with his WASP roots that he doesn't let you forget for one minute who his family is and has the nerve to pretend not to care. The word WASP appears on almost every page. Ever read a book by a catholic where the word CATHOLIC is always capitalized? How about JEW? This book should have been published by a vanity press. Sorry to say but the author is not a good writer, even though he is a WASP!! (Harvard-educated)"
4,My House will be 100 in 16 Years,"I have lived in my own house for 50 years. This is a model of how to write about that house and about that family. Wonderful phrases in in this book. ""Hot, laden with gear, and smelling of fish."", ""Thefront porch is littered with baseball mitts,snorkels,buckets, flip-flops strands of dried and slightly odoriferous seawood"".A book to dip back into from time to time."
4,The Power of Tradition,"This book is a wonderful exposition of the role that family and tradition play in the preservation of the natural beauties of America. Handed down from generation to generation, a huge old seashore mansion has nurtured a family's heritage from the past and the latest generation is faced with how to preserve this treasure in a time of increased costs. The descriptions of the natural elements of water, trees, and wind, of the family relationships, and of the development of the ways in which as the years pass the sports and social relationships change are well done. I found the book an excellent picture of a long term tie between people, a house and the land, and a real contribution to social history."
4,Charming and insightful,"Anyone who has a summer home, even if nowhere near as grand as the one in this book, will enjoy the drama of these properties passing on to the next generations."
5,A Magnificent Book,"This book is so good it had me weeping at the sheer beauty of the memories, the passion, the sadness of losing the Big House, and the family history including mental breakdowns. You can smell the smells and see the sights and feel the longing on each page. I started to read slower and slower as I neared the last page because I did not want the experience to end. If you have ever been to a summer home, even for one season, even just for a visit, you will relate to the perfect descriptions of everything involved. This book brought back childhood memories I have not thought of in decades. Big House is a beautiful story, magnificently told, a privilege to read. I thank the author for his gift to me. How ironic that the money he earns from this book would probably allow him to ""save"" the house but, alas, it comes too late. Make sure you experience this book."
3,Solid Solo Outing,"Daltrey's first venture into a full solo album began as a vehicle to help friend Leo Sayer and his writing partner David Courtney a recording deal. Daltrey agreed to use his credentials to record an album of mostly Sayer/Courtney songs that, if successful, would launch the Sayer as an act of his own. The album did well, and Sayer soon recorded the very good but little known 'Silverbird' album. 'Daltrey' stands on its own as a solid work due to the quality songs, sensible production and Daltrey's incredible vocals."
2,Stick with The Who.,"Roger Daltrey was a terrific vocalist. His work with The Who is a major contribution to the history of British Rock. As a solo artist, he was never able to create anything of much significance. Daltrey doesn't write, and the material here is better suited for someone else. The backing musicians are competent but offer no inspiration. Flat material, flat performances, and Leo Sayer(! ) as a primary composer. Give this a pass, go back to The Who...Simon"
3,High Schmaltz,"Don't buy this album expecting a bunch of Who-like performances from Roger Daltrey. Let the fact that Leo ""All By Myself"" Sayer was one of Daltrey's primary collaberators on this record tell you all you need to know about it. Instead of The Who's sonic power, you get instead a lot of neo-hippie folkie silliness, and some occasional overreaching orchestral arrangements. That's not to say its all bad. In fact, some of the songs succeed on a guilty pleasure type level. Particularly the two song suite ""Its a Hard Life/Giving it All Away,"" an orchestral number that gives Daltrey a chance to test his full vocal range with powerful overwrought emoting. ""You Are Yourself"" (wow, what a dopey title) is nearly as good in the same vein, while ""Thinkin',"" ""One Man Band"" and ""Weight of the World"" are decent folkie cuts.Bottom line is if you accept the fact that this album in no way shape or form resembles Daltrey's work with Pete and the boys, you might find that its kind of fun."
2,Limited Appeal at Best,"Other than ""Hard Life"" and ""Giving it all Away"", which are terrific, there's not much here to recommend."
4,Creative and powerful!,"On this disc, Daltrey gives us a better understanding of why the WHO has such staying power. The power of vocals like ""You Are Yourself"" and the creative genius of songs like ""One Man Band"" show us a great rock musician at work. This is a disc to listen to over and over."
4,Quite Good,"I really enjoyed this album and will be playing it for years to come. Lots of great, catchy tunes and folk melodies. The orchestral arrangements and violin add depth to most of the songs. There are a few weak titles here and there, but still is quite an immpressive album."
2,Not Black Filter but Red?!?!?,"Great product, not complaints about performance (which obviously is the main thing). However, the thing is my air filter that came with this product is Red, not Black. This may not matter to most people; however, it's clearly not red in the picture. This matters to me only partly because I am dressing my engine up with all black and gray accessories, and this really throws off everything. So I'm probably going to spend more money and change this filter out. Not happy about that."
4,Tent review,"Nice spacious tent with two rooms. Problem is the footprint necessary to set up tent. You must find a large enough camp spot for this tent. It's worth finding the right spot. I use the extra room for comfort, like inflatable furniture."
2,"Very spacious, but not too sturdy","I've only used this tent about 4 times and one of the main poles broke. It got bent at one point, so we do whats obvious, bend it back. It becomes more and more weak and eventually broke at Coachella while the winds were super high, not fun.Now I've come to realize that we don't really need a tent this high and spacious. A nice low, more sturdy one made just for our bags and sleeping would do. I would not recommend this tent for $400. I think my brother bought it for less than $100"
4,Great sturdy tent,"This tent was easy to set up and was very sturdy in unfavorable conditions. The tent stayed dry through rain and also provided plenty of sunshine through all of the big windows (which can also be covered up).The tent has plenty of room inside and also comes with a small canopy to keep the entryway dry. The room divider, although sewn into the tent, can be unzipped and strapped to the sides to open up the rooms to each other. Overall, I am very happy with this tent."
5,An Outdoor Mansion,I was a little skeptical that a tent this large could be easy to set up. Needless to say I was skeptical this tent would look as good as the pictures. After taking everything out of the package I was amazed how quickly everything came together. The tent took roughly 30 minutes with two people to set up. Everything is made very well with the poles being much stronger than in previous tents of mine.Once the tent is set up you have outdoor living at it's best. The tent comes with several windows that make it stay cool during the day. It even has a mat to wipe dirt off your shoes. I was amazed how large this thing is. Room for several adults or many children. We had three adults and two dogs with plenty of room to spare.For anyone looking for a quality tent at a superb price this is it....
5,"Sturdy construction, Quick set-up....","This tent is fantastic! Heavy-duty metal tube stock poles are sturdy and allow the tent to go up literally in minutes. With the rain flaps unzipped, it is more like a screen room to maximize breezes on warm days. At 16x10 feet there is ample room to move around and the 'stand-up' height is always a big plus! The ground mat is a nice feature for helping keep dirt/leaves, etc. from getting tracked inside the tent. Because of the slope of the tent front, the canopy awning just allows you to get a step or two out of the rain, but it does help shade the interior as the sun moves around the sky. Overall, I am very happy with this product.If there is a drawback, its the carry/storage bag. It is much to tight of a fit, requiring precise folds and a lot of 'compaction' when folding up the tent for storage; but this a a minor flaw considering that the tent is such a great product. I solved this problem by switching out totes with another tent that I have."
3,"Great deal, okay tent.","We needed a large tent, and this one was $60 during the deal a day promo before Christmas.Here are the dings:-The fabric is not ripstop-The tent requires staking down, which means you need ground that will hold the stakes. (No loose dirt, no concrete, etc)-The bag is HUGE, and still very hard to fit everything back into it.The plus:-The tent is HUGE."
5,This tent is Huge!!,"This tent is enormous but surprisingly easy to set up. By myself I can have it set up in 10 Minutes. The only thing I dont like about it is the awning, IT always seems to fall down in high winds, but no worries, its a great family tent."
3,"Pretty good, but definitely not his best.","David Morrell writes some truly excellent action/thriller novels. I have always found his work difficult to put down, just as this one was. However, this book had one of the lamest endings that he has ever contrived. It just left me unsatisfied, as the main bad guy just kind of dies in a random fashion while running around in his cheesy vampire outfit. It just was not up to par with what I expect from Morrell"
5,First Morrell book I read-and why I still read only his!,"This was the first book I have read from David Morrell and this book is a prime example of why I continue to read his novels. Very original and easy to read-but hard to put down and dissapointing when you do! I loved the charecters, but most of all I loved the ending! It leaves you dazzled and left thinking! David you have done great again! Buy this book!Blake Boyd"
3,Blood Oath,"Of late I find I do not read as much as I used to...what with TV and movies presenting so many good things to watch reading is relegated to a back seat. However, in reading ""Blood Oath"" I didn't feel it met the standard set up by my first reading of Morrell's..his ""First Blood""...but I did find enough interesting in this novel to keep me going.I found the plot to be a bit twisted and almost unbelievable...Houston can't find his father's grave, nor the individual who promised to take care of it, then his wife is killed and he narrowly escapes death....c'mon, David, give me a break. Although I did find his ""tour de France"" impressive. As you can tell I was not that impressed and hope when I read other of his writings I will find my needs fulfilled.E.J. Walden, author of ""Operation Snow Owl"""
3,Not up to the standards of later offerings by Morrell,"David Morrell's later works are usually tension-filled thrillers that feature bad guys pursuing the good guys while the good guys try to thwart the nefarious plot of the evildoers.This one had all of those elements but Morrell's writing style is not quite perfected in this early novel. Sometimes he had me, other times...no.I would seriously recommend just about any other Morrell book that came after this one before reading this one.Final grade: C+."
4,Not recommended,"As a long-time Morrell fan, I can tell you there are much better Morrell books out there. The book is short, so if you want a quick read, it may help you pass a few hours, but I recommend trying out First Blood, Testament or Last Reveille first."
1,Not his best work,"I have to agree with other reviewers who were not enthused about this book. I've only recently discovered Morrell, and enjoyed Assumed Identity, Double Image, and Burnt Sienna so very much... so was expecting a terrific read. In fairness, I realize now this is one of his earlier works.. and so, using this book as a benchmark for comparison..... Morrell's certainly developed a way with story telling and considerable writing skills since this endeavor. I tried to like it, but the characters and storyline left me wishing I'd read a review of the book before I picked it up."
2,Less than I expected,"Now I know why everyone says that they always dislike live songs/albums, of any type of music. I loved D.I.T.C.'s, self titled studio album. I like the quality of the songs on their live CD, but the beats are not as good as their studio album, which had classic songs. Almost every song on that CD is good, with the exception of a few, but that is to be expected. If you wanted to hear the full wrath of these great rappers, I say that you get their self titled studio album, you will not be disappointed."
2,Less than I expected,"Now I know why people always say that they dislike live albums. It doesn't matter whether it is rap, or rock, or any type of music. I do love D.I.T.C., no doubt, but I have to say that I was disappointed with this CD. I like when they sing solo, and not together;and they sang together a lot of this album. The beats were not a good as there stdio album, which I LOVE and will never get old. I just thought that since that CD was one of my favorite that this one would also be another one of my favorites, but it isn't. I'm going to keep this CD, just to have it, but I do wish that it was more like there self titled album."
5,About Rabbi Levine and Father Treacy,"Rabbi Levine and Father Treacy were friends for 25 years. They met in 1960 when Father Treacy was chosen to the Catholic representative to the award winning interfaith television program, Challenge, which had been organized by Rabbi Levine. The program aired for fourteen years. Their friendship sprang from those meetings and together they wrote, Wild Branch on the Olive Tree, a book about their relationship.Rabbi Levine was inspired to found Camp Brotherhood and asked Father Treacy to join him. Through the Camp and other projects, they strove to reach as many people as possible with their message encouraging interfaith and interracial dialogue and understanding.When Father Treacy was appointed to St. Patrick's Church, Rabbi Levine carved a beautiful altar for him inscribing it with ancient Christian symbols. At Rabbi Levine's death, Father Treacy committed himself to carrying on the interfaith work they had been doing together for so many years."
5,Important Film,This film is one of the most important documentaries I've ever seen. It does an excellent job of informing us of what has warped our way of life that makes it so hard for us to be an independent people and a nation. Forget politics! Find out about the true power...Corporations.
5,A must see...,"The video starts off a little slow, but well worth watching. It will make you view everything going on in the world very differently. Definitly not what I expected to get out of the DVD when I hit play. Highly recommend!!"
1,"Really, Really Dumb","I was hoping I could show this film to my business ethics class, in order to spark some interesting discussion. I was very disappointed. It is certainly one of the worst pieces of ratiocination I have ever examined -- I would not want to waste my students' time with it. It's not worth discussing. It makes heavy use of a version of the economic notion of ""externalities"" which is more or less incoherent."
2,The Corporation,"Interesting, however, it has an agenda that spoils what could have been much more revealing, if they had taken the time to show the other side of each story. No doubt there is a need for this kind of information, which if it could bring both points of view to our attention we would all be better off. Disappointing, shallow."
3,"Want your jeans ""stone-washed"" ?","Corporations compete with one another for the business of consumers. This documentary shifts the blame from the consumer to the corporation.After you watch this, you feel good that it's not your fault that your dollar created the support system for these poor villages.While I enjoyed watching this video and would recommend it to anyone for entertainment, some basics are completely distorted. For example, if you want your jeans stone-washed or distressed, you pay a couple of dollars for that look. Your dollars support the Mexican village that resides on the banks of a river that is polluted by the chemicals you pay for. Were it not for your dollar, that village wouldn't exist. You make it possible for poverty to persist. Without your dollar, these people that appear miserable in our modern, 1st world eyes wouldn't be alive."
5,THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE,"***FANTASTIC FILM***...And I'm a Conservative!!!..........This should be required viewing in all schools and should be played quarterly on all PBS stations in the Country as a reminder...The politicians need a good kick in the ass and know they work for the public good, not the corporations...Corrupt officials and big business must be prosecuted...Lobbyists should be banned...The people have to take back this Country...NOW!!!"
5,Worth what i paid and more,I have seen this documentary SEVERAL times and even checked it out of my local library THREE times. I learn something new each time i watch it and therefore wanted to own it so that i can take notes and review. The idea of psychoanalyzing the corporation as a person was paradigm shifting to say the least. This is the kind of thinking that moves humanity progressively forward. Outstanding!
3,"Good, but it could have been much better.","This film is comprehensive, but it ends up going on too long. Too many tangents and too much commentary from unsubstantive individuals (Moore, Chomsky, etc.). It certainly raises some interesting questions, but the focus is far too wide and it ends up raising too many questions. The narrator is annoying to say the least. The presentation of the WTO, IMF and World Bank protests is one-sided to say the least, and grossly inaccurate. A much better film, with substantially more credibility, is Commanding Heights."
4,Broad and Sweeping,"Strong, sweeping overview of the history of the corporation from a decidedly pro-Environment and capitalism-is-the-root-of-all-evil bent.The interviews with Chomsky are a delight.Highly recommended for business buffs."
1,One Sided and No Alternative,"The documentary makes a good case that corporations are about making money as it shows many examples of this. However, after watching it through, I realized they had literally spent the whole movie complaining about corporations, but they had offered really no alternative. To add insult, their approach was very biased and one-sided as they cherry picked all the worst examples in history while ignoring the many good cases of corporations.In essence, the documentary serves no purpose, but to advance an agenda without regard to total truth. The documentary would have been a lot better if they highlighted good examples of corporations and spend the latter half arguing from where to go from here."
4,More educational than you would think,"When looking at documentaries now, you can't help but wonder whose view you are going to get. This doesn't mean you are getting bad information, but you are usually getting a very perceptible slant. In this film, I feel a lean to left, but the writers and director ensured that others get a chance to speak, as well as took the time to explain how corporations work so that readers have a better understanding about what a corporation is.The film is not pure textbook, although it explains what a corporation is and how it works. The film focuses more on where corporations have gone awry. By the end of the film, you will find yourself deeply disturbed (the extended ""case study"" of a particular pharmaceutical company), but the director made sure that you see that there is some hope (the CEO of a carpet company discussing his goal for environmental sustainability).I would recommend watching this documentary."
5,a thoughtful look in the mirror,"This movie is a long overdue look in the mirror for people of the USA. It examines and presents evidence about such questions as: Are we still a democracy or are we a capitalist state, do corporations serve humanity or do humans serve corporations, does unbridled capitalism produce the best results for all human endeavors (such as health care-- the US spends twice as much as any other country per person on health care, yet has an average life expectancy shorter than that of Bosnia.) Evidence is presented in an interesting, often humorous fashion.""The Corporation"" gives an overview of social organization throughout history so the viewer can see that we humans are evolving and the future is open to our choices. The important thing is to examine our history , learn and choose wisely.(This is not a movie for those who do not like to think or who are fully occupied by thoughts of what their next purchases will be -- i.e. sheep and piggies.)"
4,Have some legitemate info. ...,"Yes, it seems that it has a little taste of socialism and environmentalism agenda (as some may criticize it)... but on the other hand, it provides some legitimate information and statistics.For example: IBM and Coca-Cola during the WW2, patenting living organism...WARNING: you may be disturbed after watching this video.Generally - good documentary.4 out of 5 stars.Recommended."
5,Absolutely Phenomoenal,"This film is absolutelty phenomenal. It is an ephiphany creating film that will alter the way you look at corporations and make your every day purchases, for the better. Picture a film with the intellect and debating skill of Micheal Moore and yet the maturity and seriousness of an adult ;-), that is this film. Hands down the best."
4,Prompt delivery,"The ordered disc set, The Corporation, arrived promptly and was free of any blemishes and appeared new as advertised. It is an eye-opener about how corporations operate."
5,Scary but true...,"Brand names run the world. The most recognizable word in the planet is ""ok"", after that it's ""Coca Cola"". Well, ranging from McDonalds, White castle, IBM, to Apple, advertising is everywhere, and this movie will show you how far corporations are willing to go to get recognized (placing ads on actual human beings as well as infiltrating schools). It also analyzes corporations as entities. It's a highly disturbing film, as it shows that the world will be run by a few corporate entities if laws are not changed. A must see."
1,great half a dvd,Well simply put ...chapter 1-6 was great..!!! ..nothing else would display after 6.Over 50% was defective.So I played 3 other Dvd's....no problem. What can I say?
1,"Terrible, don't bother","As Mr. Downey writes, this book is horrible. There are about 2 sentences of valuable information in the whole thing. Half to book is dedicating to instruction for the included software, which crashes my PC. Obviously this book was written to try and sell software, not as the technical resource it claims to be.Whatever you do, do not buy this book, unless you want to waste some money."
1,Lovely but empty,"This book simply does not deliver any content. It is a well-written, attractively formatted, 199 page advertisement for a commercial product. I was extremely disappointed. It is the only book I have ever bought (and I've bought thousands) that I sent back. You will not learn anything from reading this book as most of it is spent describing a demo of the commercial product."
4,Must Have!!!!,"I ""mistakenly"" found the Saw Doctors when I downloaded one of their songs by mistake off the interent. They quickyl became my favorite band and now I have all of their CD's. This was the first one I bought and I highly recommend it to anyone that is just discovering the Saw Docs. Their isn't a bad song on the album. It shows the range of the Docs music from partying Irish pub (""Hay Wrap, I Useta Lover) to singing of the beauty of Ireland (""Green and Red of Mayo, Clare Island) to their great songs about love and relationships (""Share the Darkness, Wake Up Sleeping, Red Cortina). This is a great CD to start with. One you buy this one, you'll certainly get the rest.One thing, to truly expreience the Docs, you have to see them live in concert. I brought my brother and friend to a show. They never heard a song by the Docs, but after the concert, they were hooked. See them live!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,A Screenplay Waiting to Happen,"Nicholas's Weinstock's ""As Long As She Needs Me"" is a screenplay disguised as a novel, with a premise so idiodic only Hollywood would approve. It purports to be an inside look at the world of publishing, but it offers few insights other than the nuts-and-bolts details that anyone who works in the industry will be familiar with. ( A sales conference is where publishers' launch a book? Wow!) The characters are vaguely drawn, uninspiring, and the ""love story"" at its center is pure nonsense. There is a great novel to be written about this subject, but this doesn't even come close."
2,Sparks of funny that never ignited,"This book had a few funny parts, but just never got off the ground. The main character was not multi-dimensional. It was not the fun read I had expected. I had to force myself to finish it."
2,...something is missing,"While this book is a light read, I found it to fall very short in being entertaining. First of all, it was unbelievable. Secondly, the author's jokes just aren't funny. He's trying to be clever, but fails. Third, I never truly believed the characters were in love. The characters have no backbone. A very disappointing read and I would not recommend."
3,A fun beach read!,"This is a perfect book for light summertime reading at the beach or by the pool. The story is sweet and the author has some sharp-witted comments about being a personal assistant that made me laugh out loud! All in all, an easy read and a fun story."
4,Cute Book :),"I decided to buy a copy of this book after reading the review in 'People' magazine. I enjoyed the author's wit and subtle humor. Certainly the romance was fluffy, which I though added to the book's charm. I did find Dawn's foul language to be a bit excessive but other than that the story was cute. If you are looking for some good humor pick up a copy."
1,a divergent opinion,"I bought this book based on all the raves I kept encountering and was completely disappointed. I kept waiting for the piercing insights and stunning prose to arrive, but they never did. Instead I was met with paper-thin characters, lurid scenarios and a nasty, cynical world-view. I chucked my copy in the recyclilng bin."
1,"Boring, stale cartoonish characters","Yet another lesson to not always believe the hype. . . this awful story is simplistically about hypocritical, narcissistic actors and their buddhist pretenses and some pathetic fans--the BIG UNFRESH IDEA of this repetitious, shallow and stultifying novel. The only good thing about the book is it makes you respect even more the writers who know how to build an interesting, complex plot and create characters to match. The guy who wrote this book seems like a garden variety hipster poseur to me. I'm selling my copy to a used bookstore just so I can get a few dollars back from the sum I wasted on it."
5,FINALLY A GREAT NOVEL ABOUT HOLLYWOOD,"Since I've also trudged across this country by Amtrak, because of my own fear of flying, like a character in this terrific novel, I followed a friend's recommendation and bought this splendid and funny novel. What a treat. It examines Hollywood like a strong lethal and very funny (you laugh out loud) magnifying glass - following wonderful characters - including the self-absorbed life of a wannabe actress, who is a Drew Barrymore look-alike. It is all about the people who spend their lives scratching on the screen door of show business. Blocked like flies from ever getting close to the glamour of Hollywood they long for, we laugh and cry as they make their quest to find nirvana in this very nasty place. These fringe people are dealt with by Wagner with wry social commentary. This is a must read and I will read it again, when like poor Lisanne, I make my cross country journey east curled up in my sleeping car bedroom with this great book. Bravo to Mr. Wagner."
1,Paul McCartney - not in performance,"Don't waste your time with this , especially if you are a Beatles fan or McCartney fan. No real performances performed played all the way through. Basically a bunch of so called friends and Beatles experts telling you what you already know or don't need to know. Nothing of substance. Yesterday and She loves You ar ethe two songs they focus on throught much of the DVD."
4,Living Gluten-free for Dummies,The book was quite well written and complete except for the recipes. There should be more simple recipes that people use in ordinary meals. The book is for dummies!
4,Living Gluten free,"I am very pleased with this book, it gives the information I needed in a very easy way to understand. This is a difficult way of eating to begin with as there are not that many items that are gluten free. However, this books shows you how to make this change easier and, experiment with flours, etc. along the way."
4,Gluten - lifestyle chalenge,"For those who were told to watch their Gluten intake, this is an importnat source of information, written in a easy to read and concise format.Life mamagement with Gluten free food."
5,So Helpful!,"For me, when I found out that I could no longer eat gluten I was completely lost. I didn't even know what gluten was let alone how to deal with not eating it anymore. This book was such a help in understanding what was going on with me and how I could make myself better.This book is written in such a way that it seems as though it was meant for those who just got ""the news"" that they get to never eat gluten again becase it is upbeat and optimistic on you being able to do it without actually sacraficing anything.Very good book :)"
5,Another wonderful book from Danna,Danna has a way with talking about living gluten free. Too many books are written by people who don't have first hand experience with what they are writing about. Danna knows!
5,Living Gluten-Free for Dummies,This book is an excellent product for those new to this diet. It gives good basic information about celiacs disease and wheat intolerance. There is a section with basic recipes for the items one needs to change and information on where to get gluten-free products. I was loaned this book before I bought it and found it to be a good resource.
5,Easy to read and understand,I have enjoyed this book more than any other gluten info book. The information is easy to read and understand. I have lent it to friends and family and they all have given fave reviews as well.The format is the same as the other Dummies books.
4,Living Gluten-Free For Dummies By Danna Korn,"You won't feel like a dummy after reading this book on Celeac Disease, you will feel well informed."
2,overly complicated,"For a ""Dummies"" book, this was overly complicated and difficult to read. If you need information about gluten-free, I would recommend the complete idiots guide. It was much easier to understand and follow."
2,Living Gluten free for Dummies,The book Living Gluten Free for Dummies has a lot of helpful information but the writing style feels full of sarcasim and I do not like that in a book in this category. I will use it as a reference but I would not recommend it to others. She has gone too personal and it doesn't work for me.
2,Please pass the agenda-free bread...,"I was looking for a book that would gently walk me through the process of avoiding gluten in foods for my daughter. I'm sure this book has that information, but I found myself insulted within the first few chapters as a 'glutenavore' who ate 'contaminated' foods, and was by default unhealthy. If you're looking for help, and not a lecture on the Evils of the Gluten Eaters Lifestyle, this is not the book for you."
3,OK,"When I found out I had Celiac Disease, this was the first book I came across and I just wasn't impressed. The Cheat Sheet in front of the book was the most helpful and I still have to check out some of the recipies. But all in all, I didn't get much out of it."
5,Information that is really needed,"This is the best book for learning about gluten free life. My daughter was very happy with book, she found out about hidden gluten in many foods, if you are newly diagnosed this book will truly help you understand."
5,Must buy!,"This CD is a wonderful collection of great female blues artists. It has a wonderful variety of songs that range from traditional gritty blues songs like Sweet Home Chicago to more soulful tunes like One Good Man. This is a great album to add to your collectionl, especially if you are just first starting a blues collection."
2,Doesnt match up to the first two.,"I really, really enjoyed the first two DVDs. And there is some excellent content ahead. So I can't say don't buy 3,4 and 5.But, starting with DVD 3 you are going to have a lot of filler. In this DVD in particular entire episodes are complete junk - we're talking about static images, paper cutouts moved around on sticks, video inserts and photography experiments in the place of any real animation or story development. The only comparison I can make is the ending of Evangellion, not suprisingly.Fans may not like me saying this, but it's true and buyers should be warned. Myself, I bought the entire series.But if your cash is precious to you and you're making hard choices you may feel cheated - the next 3 DVDs have about 1 DVD worth of real story development between them."
3,"Decent, but lacks in comparison to the Previous Volumes","His and Her Circumstances (Kare Kano) is a wonderful show, but it has one major flaw - the incredible amount of summary used. In other anime like Cowboy Bebop this was eliminated altogether, and wonderfully entertaining filler episodes were used instead.In Kare Kano, however, there is a summary at the beginning of nearly EVERY episode, and it begins to feel like they are mocking the viewer, as well as not having enough to fill in the whole episode. In this volume, there is a summary of the entire series from episode 1-12 in episode 13, but it doesn't stop there. The first half of episode 14 is also used as summary.Don't get me wrong, though. The entire series as a whole is wonderful. There is wonderful comedy, drama and romance throughout the whole show, but the amount of pointless summary is discouraging."
5,More Quintessential Holmes,"And now for the 4th DVD in the continuing MPI series of Granda/PBS Sherlock Holmes series, both introduce regular supporting actors in the series. In ""The Greek Interpreter"" a man becomes an unwilling pawn to kidnappers of a Greek couple from the old country. In this episode we meet Holmes' older brother Mycroft for the first time. Mycroft is played by Charles Gray who played the role in the feature film of the 70s, ""The Seven Percent Solution"" with Nicol Williamspn, Robert Duvall and Alan Arkin. In ""The Norwood Builder"" an old builder writes a new will leaving everything to a lawyer then promptly dies and the young solicitor gets accused of the crime. This episode introduces the one Scotland Yard Investigator that Holmes can't stand, Lestrade played by Colin Jeavons. Eventually he will earn Holmes' respect. Keep em coming MPI Video."
3,The Good The Bad and the Ugly,"I now own all four versions of this movie. This one is third best.THE GOOD- C.Thomas Howell. His acting, and his part is excellent! Jake Busey as the psyco army officer is also excellent. The human intrest side stories, the lady whose husband, and child are killed, the minister whose faith are shaken by the invaders. One shocking scene that I never saw coming.THE BAD- Some parts dragged. The invaders were not included in as much of the movie as I would have liked.THE UGLY- The tripods are not tripods at all, but look like giant spiders. No real confrontation with the military. Special effects not very good. No explanation as to what killed the invaders.ALL IN ALL- Without the gore could have been a chic flick. That said if you can get it used for 8 Bucks as I did it is well worth the money!!!"
1,Downhill All the Way,"I suspect that until their dying days, the cast members of this stinkball will be apologizing for having had anything to do with it. The ""fighting machines"" look like overgrown spiders, the scenes of ""mass destruction"" look like they were filmed at a landfill, and we mostly get C. Thomas Howell wandering around agonizing over his ""lost"" family (which really isn't, of course).The best thing about this movie is the nude shower scene Howell's screen wife does at the beginning. From there, it's downhill all the way."
2,this war kinda sucks unless you are BRITISH!,"I kinda liked the movie until I realized this movie has 2 hours more drama than even Steven Spielbergs' movie or the original (Which, unfortunatly, is going upwards of over $100.00 just for the DVD.LOL) It does have some good effects, BUT ONLY IF YOU'RE PLAYING A VIDEOGAME. Sure, some scenes shocked me, but it still looked like an internet movie. (If YOU've seen the movie YOU know what I'm talking about. If not, just know the screen looks like it's having some kind of slow down UNTIL the effects come along, then you know somebody made this KINDA CRAPPY MOVIE ON THEIR OWN COMPUTER.) I hope these guys aren't thinking about getting a PROPHET!!!!!!LOLOLOLLO>OLLOLOLLOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,THIS IS NOT WAR OF THE WORLDS,"This movie was called INVASION, then they changed its name H.G. WELLS WAR OF THE WORLDS just before the Spielberg film came out. This is not the other H.G. WELLS THE WAR OF THE WORLDS, which was a low budget adaptation trying to do the book. NOW the producers have changed the name back to INVASION again to cash in on the TV series, INVASION, about to broadcast. This movie is not WELLS. It is not WAR OF THE WORLDS. The nudity that they put in it is bland and you are better off renting PORN if you want that. Avoid this movie like the plague. If you look at this company's website, they gleefully have knocked off (copied) many bigger movies as their mainstay. If this movie were a newspaper it would make the fish wrapped in it smell bad."
1,C Thomas Howell should be sorry about this one,"This is for sure the worst movie I have seen this yr to date--C Thomas Howell should be sorry about this one--he is a good B type actor but I cannot figure why he agreed to do this straight to video version of a classic-bad acting, really fake aliens and backgrounds, many things left unexplained, what caused the aliens to melt way--never clear in the movie. Howell should be ashamed of himself--to put his name to a really bad bad movie.."
4,One of the Best Asylum Movies,"Asylum makes some good movies and some bad movies. This is one of their best. Special effects (digital and old-school), scenery/locations, and acting are all good to great. The script is obviously different from other adaptations of ""War of the Worlds"", but that's not a problem with this movie. It is both fun and interesting.- C. Thomas Howell is the main character. As such, he undergoes the greatest transformation over 97 minutes. He gives an outstanding performance.- Rhett Giles gives a notable performance as a priest whose character also changes radically during the movie.- Jake Busey is perfect as a soldier who falls completely apart. His (minor) character is both intelligent and completely insane.Apart from some brief nudity at the beginning, this movie is PG-13 at worst. Some graphic violence/gore and complex adult situations make this movie too adult for pre-teens."
2,Eh,"To be honest, I saw the DVD cover and was expecting a bad (meaning good and cheesy) sci-fi flick. Unfortunately, it didn't even deliver the fun cheese. Sometimes things are so bad they are good. This was just plain bad. While the plotline kinda-sorta followed the book, the script was poorly written, the special effects were not very special, and the acting was fairly embarassing. This wasn't even a good, schlocky B-movie.Don't bother with this one."
3,Too Many War of the Worlds..,"I think this version was an ok version of War of the Worlds. I am still a bigger fan of the Original War of the Worlds(1953). I also thought that Speilburgs version could of been a lot better, i was hoping that he'd focus more on the War then the family that kept running. I think the special effects in this one are a little dated, yet it is the best one ive seen since the Original 1953 version."
2,"well, maybe a 2.5","Movie started great...alien sound effects came out great frommy stereo system....then after a while, i notice some second ratespecial effects comming in....then i fell asleep...Upon waking up i reviewed the movie again and found out there wasa lot of yapping ...and more yapping.........Bottom line... not enough action....too much blah blah blah.I do recomment this movie for fans of War of the Worlds.."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I really tried to watch this but could not make it through without fast forwarding through most of it. Special effects were neither.Bad. Bad. Bad. Sorry filmmakers, but you were just cashing in on the remake when it came out hoping that someone would pick this up at the video store and not realize it wasn't the same one. Avoid this even if you like bad movies. This is just bad..."
1,This movie has nothing to offer,"I'm afraid I have to disagree with the other reviewers. This movie has nothing to offer.I suppose if your a teenager and want to see some nudity then you might enjoy it. But its a pure exploit film with few or little choices made. The acting is quite soap opera bad and the CGI is pedestrian. Sorry, but I can't recommend it."
1,"surprisingly outstanding performances, but....","generally, i don't leave too many reviews around here. especially when i have to report how terribly disappointing this remake is. actually, how terrible it is.i was surprised how frequently amateurish the production felt - and not just the often distracting FX. disjointed editing and frequent continuity errors just SCREAMED ""i'm a cheap movie"".when i saw that the writer-director-producer-editor-etc-etc was the same person, i could not help but admire his ambition. even if his talents weren't nearly up to the task.curiously, both this version and the Spielberg-version focus on a disfunctional-family being displaced by the alien-invasion. and both end identically (no spoilers here).unless you've REALLY intent on wasting 100 minutes of your life, i'd skip this video to find something more rewarding to watch."
2,Standard Asylum movie.,"This movie was pretty much what I expected from an Asylum production, with some exceptions. The movie has some real actors. C Thomas Howell is pretty good in the lead and Jake Busey is funny in his brief appearances. The special effects are sometimes awful and sometimes not-bad. Like other Asylum movies, the sound is very bad. I couldn't hear much of he dialogue and turned the volume up high, which hurt my ears during the sudden action sequences. The script was uneven. It wasn't all bad but much of the last half of the movie was spent on discussions about religion, which got tiring pretty quickly. There are also some long sequences where almost nothing happensThis is not a movie to spend money on unless you're a fan of The Asylum."
1,"I Expected Little, And Got Even Less","I figured I wasn't in for a great movie when I saw that my used copy came from Blockbuster, it was dated 2005, and I'd never heard of this version. The picture on the back of the box is false advertising, because it wasn't in the movie.With the few pathetic special effects scenes it had, they have the nerve to include an added video about how they did them. Luckily, my DVD has a flaw in the pressing which prevented me from viewing more of the extra features.One example of how bad this movie is: at the end you're supposed to be seeing the main character in the devastated city of Washington, D.C. Oh, he's sitting in a pile of rubble all right, but in the background you see countryside. Gee, did the aliens remove all the buildings they destroyed and plant grass?"
5,"HP Pavilion 15"" Notebook",I love dealing with Amazon. This was not the notebook I originally intended to purchase. The Amazon dealer did not have the HP model I was looking for and offered an upgrade. The ZV6201CL was the upgrade and I am completely satisfied. There is an extended warranty that the Amazon dealer used to go above and beyond the upgrade offer. The other HP model did have wireless but not a DVD+R/RW drive. HP has great products at reasonable prices. I bought HP for its durability and value.
3,I don't even know,"why I bought this product. I have natural hair(born in Nigeria) and it has cones in it which is not good for natural. Any way, if you are looking for a spray for your hair then I would really suggest you make your own with like a natural leave in conditioner and a little water"
3,old but useful,this map dates back to a product published in the '80s. It's not up-to-date but it is useful and may be the most current paper map of baghdad you can buy short of actually traveling to baghdad to buy it.
5,Baghdad City Map by ITMB,"Pre-2003 Coalition invasion. Not a bad product, but obviously not updated regarding names, etc."
3,Hoped for more,"I really enjoy TJB but this one was not like 'Whipped Cream' that I remember as a lad. It was, to me, so much elevator music. I'll always be nostalgic for the Lonely Bull cut, though. Also, all the sound seems to come from the right channel on most cuts except for the trumpet that comes from the left. No explanation for this. I don't know if this was just my CD or what but I'm not going through the hassle of sending it back."
5,classic...,The album that started it all. The amazing rise of Herb Alpert and the TJB.It was great to see and hear a sound and record company get started at the same time.
5,"Great first album, brings thoughts of bullfights and fiestas","This first effort from Herb Alpert (who's actually Jewish, as the booklet describes) features the Title track and one of his biggest hits. The opening to it brings to mind bullfights, lovely senoritas [tilde over the n to be read], and fiestas. Along with his other cds, South Of The Border, Whipped Creme And Other Delights, and Going Places, they provide a sound often imitated, but never duplicated. Great."
4,Good CD. Lousy packaging.,"The Lonely Bull is sort of proto-TJB. Yes, I know the title track started the phenomenon, but their best stuff was yet to come. Still this is a very enjoyable album, nicely remastered for CD.Too bad it comes in one of those crummy cardboard boxes. Is it too much to ask for a decent box for a CD? Every time you open the box the book falls out, and it's impossible to remove/replace the CD with one hand. A normal CD case works--this doesn't."
5,The one that started it all,"This album started America's love for Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass.Listen,think back to the 60's,feel the joy that comes with the first strains of ,""The Lonely Bull"".If you even like Herb Alpert a little, you have to own this."
3,Not bad.,"After reading the customer reviews, I had expected this hair straightener to be amazing, especially because of the tourmaline. However, I found that, although good, you can find a good ceramic one that works faster for about the same price. To get my hair as straight and as soft as the other hair straighteners, I would have to use the Wigo for twice as long. I feel OK about my purchase, but if I could go back and change my mind, I would."
1,Not worth the money,The design on this trivet was nowhere centered properly. It also had a red mark on the top which I didn't bother to see if that would come off because I was throwing it in the garbage anyway. I would have given it no stars if that was possible.
3,Good music-hard review,"First I am a died in the wool Quo fan, it started all the way back in high school with Pictures of Matchstick Men. I just received this cd, I like it but, it falls in the catagory of all music made in the 80's. Heavy keyboards, now Andy Bown is a great keyboard player, I even have a couple of his solo albums before Quo. But the 80's rock music was about big hair & keyboards. I would only compare this cd to other cd's made in the 80's & it is a lot better of that kind of music. I'm glad I bought it, but don't expect any hard boogie guitar riffs."
1,"A Big Lie, not as advertised. The movie is mostly in FRENCH!!!","Even if you select ""English"" for the voice track, the movie is 80% in FRENCH with English subtitles. Neither Yul Brynner nor Henry Fonda is the leading actor, as one might expect, but rather the actor most prominently appearing in the movie is a French Secret Service man played by Philippe Noiret. What English is not in subtitles, is dubbed in. This is a very poorly produced movie, made for a French audience, with only token support for English speakers, as you can expect from the French snobs."
3,Come Along Carrier,"I bought this for transporting a Lovebird. The chemical odor from the vinyl lining was so strong that I hung the carrier outside for over two weeks before the odor dissipated sufficiently that I felt is was safe to put my small bird into the carrier.Once that was done, the bird enjoyed being in the carrier as she went for her nails trimming."
5,High quality canvas and zippers,"For the price, I had expected something less sturdy. This is a sturdy product made of stiff, strong canvas and the zippers work smoothly. Very nice looking too. Has a pretty strong plasticky smell but it went away after a couple weeks. I bought it for my pet bird in case I need to take it to the vet."
3,witchcarft,this movie is what you crave when you want a scary movie. There's plenty of chill's not to mention that there's actually a good plot. I recommend you add this movie to yoour collection.
2,Good God ...,"How do lousy movies like these get made? The guy who said all the actors were ""no-names,"" wasn't kidding. Witchcraft 2 isn't much better.Maybe I'm just self-destructive. I like to watch awful movies just so I can complain about them later. Hey, if that's your thing, then by all means plunk your money down, but if it's not ... then I suggest you save it for a carton of milk."
3,Pleasantly surprised,I watched the UNRATED version. I have not (nor will I see) the PG-13 version. I jumped a few times and was mildly interested in the goings-on (Odette Yustman's beauty - Jessica Alba with depth) didn't hurt neither. And I watched this on my laptop ... hardly the ideal place to view a movie!
2,"Interesting premise, faulty presentation","I love a good scary movie. There's just something about sitting in the dark drinking in the suspense. I was given this movie by a friend and knew very little about it. I went into it expecting the typical ""creepy child"" plot, but was pleasantly surprised to find a well thought out and researched story built in mythology and folk lore. I found myself excited to see aspects of stories I grew up hearing from my grandparents depicted on screen, albeit in a new and scary way.My main issues with this movie lie with the acting. I found the two leads (Cam Gigandet, and Odette Yustman) to be lacking in this department. I did not buy their chemistry, and their ability to sell some of the admittedly hokey dialogue falls flat.On the whole, there are some legitimately good scares and creepy scenes, and the film is low on gore. -- Reviewed by Alisse Lee Goldenberg ""The Strings of the Violin"""
1,Nothing to Recommend,"I'm not a horror movie fan and bought this mostly to see more of Odette Annabelle(Justman?). I liked her in ""You Again"" but her stock keeps going down with movies like this and ""Coming Darkness"". She has two gears, or maybe just one: loud tearful, slobbery, whining and crying. BTW, there's no nudity or anything remotely erotic for the more desperate Odette fan.This supernatural thriller has a good premise, think of ""Rosemary's Baby"" meets ""The Thing"". Heavy on atmosphere, symbolism, and shock, it's almost funny.This is one of those rare movies I would rather throw out with the trash than resell or give away - I mean, I wouldn't put anyone through this movie."
3,"Good special effects, contrived plot","I'll give any horror movie 3 stars just for having good special effects. Like into the Mouth of Madness, this movie features the old walking on the hands and feet while head is twisted 180 degrees trick - an oldie but a goodie! The little kid looks creepy too - enough so that if I saw him I'd try to kick his little butt like a football. But, while directed and written by the same guy who wrote The Dark Knight, this movie comes up a bit short on the plot. Evil twin who died in womb - check. Crazy dream sequences - check. Scary little kid - check. Good execution of a lame story."
1,"""The door is open"" to CRAP!!!!!","This has to be one of the worst bigger budget horror films that I have ever seen. I don't understand why Gary Oldman and Michael Bay became involved in such a cliche' filled movie that had no scares and was such a bore to watch.This movie seemed to borrow from so many other well known films, but it didn't make it good or entertaining:1) The Exorcist (the climax)2) The Shining (the settings throughout... snowy, Gothic, etc.)3) The Omen (the scary possessed boy)You can add to the list as you watch it. (Was that the point? To mix them all into one movie? If that was the case, then it was still bad!)Very predictable. Anyone who has seen a horror movie before knew who was going to die, who would live, and probably the final outcome (twist) at the end (Rosemary's Baby).The only redeeming thing about this movie is the lead actress, Odette Yustman. Too pretty of a lady for a stinker like this!"
2,Unborn,"There was not enough preview footage of the movie to justify my purchasing the movie. To bad because I really thought it might be worth buying, but not with what I saw. Too Bad!!!The Unborn"
3,Odette Yustman looking good in her undies is worth a few stars,"Well, my title tells all, but The Unborn isn't nearly as bad as most of the critic reviews seem to indicate. Maybe because they were so harsh I was actually surprised that it didn't totally suck. The story is decent, the acting isn't the best and only about half of the CGI worked, but it's a fairly entertaining way to spend 81 minutes. I know that this film is written and directed by one of the writers of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, so you expect a lot knowing what great work he has done in the past. It's a good rainy day rental. Oh, I almost forgot about Gary Oldman. He probably did this movie because of his ""Batman"" relationship with the director. He shouldn't be anywhere near a movie this mediocre, but he does add some class to it. If nothing else, The Unborn provides plenty of eye candy in the form of the yummy Odette Yustman."
2,A lotta womb for improvement,"Better strap on some protection, UNBORN is impregnated with cheap scares, a convoluted plot, and pathetically squalid dream sequences. If you are feeling a kick from inside telling you to PUSH! this into your dvd player, I must advise you--ABORT!!!!! Grab a hangar and kill that idea quickly. It's films like these that have turned the U.S. into the red-headed stepchild of the horror industry. Nothing shocking, creepy, or interesting about this story, other than the basic premise.Young Casey (Odette Yustman) was born with something missing--her twin sister. Damn shame too, Casey's hotter than global warming. Anyway, she's begins having some warped dreams and gets harassed by an evil spirit from another dimension. Oh joy.Basically this feels like the spoiled little demonchild of THE EXORCIST and JU-ON. Demonically dumb, send this hellacious turd back down the sewage from which it came."
1,potential wasted,"this movie had potential in the plot line, but the many twists and curves were covered so topically that the audience comes away dissatisfied. i could have done without some of the tense drama in lieu of real explanation or character development.characters die for the shock value...in a movie that should be more suspense thriller/horror than slash flick. if someone tackled the screenplay with a stronger veto for the 'junk scenes', this could become far better than it was.all in all, it was a disappointment."
2,"A Jewish version of the ""Exorcist""","I basically rented this horror film because David Goyer (Blade, The Dark Knight) wrote and directed and because Gary Oldman was in it. Unfortunately, this flick was a disappointment on many levels. There are cliches abound in the script and Oldman's part as the Rabbi could've been played by anyone as well as fellow Brit Idris Elba's part as the minister--I guess they were both in for the paycheck. The only pluses in this film are Jane Alexander's brief turn as the heroine's grandmother, Odette Yustman in her undies looking like a Victoria Secret's model and the excellent Blu-ray transfer. If you looking for a better film in this genre, check out ""The Midnight Meat Train"" or ""Candyman"" (the original but not the sequels)."
1,"Not you, Gary.... Not you!","Watching 'The Unborn' is witnessing how unoriginal and formulaic Hollywood can be. There's ABSOLUTELY NOTHING in this movie that's not borrowed from some other movie. Even some shots are exactly the same.And Gee... jump scares? really? so cheap. so cheap. Simply embarrasing.Two things kept me intrigued till the end of the movie, though: 1- Why did Platinum Dunes (a good company in the horror field) produce this movie and mainly, 2- Why is Gary Oldman in it?!?! Now that's scary."
1,zzzzzz,"I saw this film when it first came out in theaters. It is hands down one of the top 5 worst movies I have ever seen. Anyone that is a fan of classic thrillers, suspense, good acting, solid plots, or good cinematography will not enjoy the hour and a half of your life being wasted. The only thing terrifying about this film was watching Gary Oldman degrade a solid acting career. If you feel that I am just a cynical wanna-be movie critic for my comments, then by all means, watch it. The ending is so ridiculous it almost makes it worth it"
2,"Fun to look at, but that's it","This movie looked like lots of fun from the trailer, but it turned out to be a disappointment like most other horror movies that are being put out lately. Relied too heavily on jump-scares rather than true scares. Just underwhelming. Any truly creepy stuff was derivitive."
2,Nothing to see but Odette,"How the hell did they manage to get Gary Oldman. I'm guessing multiple movie contract because this is not a movie that likes of him would wanna be a part of. Basic idea is very simple and the rest of the movie is based on this idea. That's mainly the reason the movie sucks. Apart from the simplistic mystical twin connection idea, every scary scene feels like mix and match from various movies. They look nice independently but sometimes you ask ""Why is this in this movie"" or ""Who on earth thought this will fit into this movie?"".Odette is nice though, easy on the eyes. We will be following her career. Overall, good production, simple plot, been there done that scary scenes, no entertainment value, nice chick. A risky buy, so I would reccommend renting it only if they ran out of every other horror movies."
2,What not to do when making a horror film.,"If I was teaching a class on how to make a horror film, I'd play ""The Unborn"" right after ""Drag Me to Hell,"" to show how to make all the elements that work in horror fall flat.First off, it's obvious the lead actress was hired for her looks alone. She spends most of the movie looking like she's not really present. Her deer in the headlight look doesn't make her seem innocent, just vacuous. She generated absolutely no sympathy from the audience, making the entire haunting just an empty exercise in CGI head spinning.And the exorcism was boring. People getting knocked around, violent wind, occasional possessed people..... Yawn. Oh, was I suppose to be scared? Sorry, I just couldn't stay awake.I could keep going on, but why bother? Buyer beware."
2,Should have stayed unborn,"Someone else said it perfectly -- this kind of film is what's turned the American horror film into trite, unscary sludge. The film starts out with an interesting premise, but almost immmediately gets bogged down in the director trying to make it ""scary."" Borrowing (that's the polite word) visuals from Exorcist, Grudge (not that that was any 5-star film in itself), and Jacob's Ladder, the film ends up being laughable rather than creepy, and borders on boring in most cases. Not one you'll regret missing. Guess Oldman needed a paycheck; what he was doing in this is beyond me."
2,WHAT THE DUMP & STUPID GARBAGE!!,"I cant believe the good director, and the great ""Michael bay"" they come up with this sloooww a** horror movie as they call it. I was sooo bored of that starring going back and forth with kid, same old paste over and over with cheap scare. Just the whole thing is mess, lame ands AWFUL! Most the strange scenes were in the ""theater trailer"" so U knew what's going to happen next!. Skip this garbage, NOT wroth it ! C"
1,A complete BOMB...,"Horrible acting, Odette Yustman is embarrassingly bad in this movie. The plot would have been O.K. but they didn't pull it off. It just felt like a kabbalah recruitment video. Don't waste your time on this stinker."
3,Hey did the same dude give two 5* reviews???,You might want to consider that both 5* reviews are by the same dude. This is an OK movie but get it on sale.

4,Good Cd,Status Quo went through some changes at the time.They lost their drummer and this was a new look Quo.This is a hard rocking Cd this and it has some bonus tracks.They produced a good album here.
4,D.I.T.C Live Vol.1,"On This CD We See DITC At It's Best,Even Though Big L(R.I.P)Could Not Be Not Take Part. The Cd Mixes DITC's Greatest Hits With Never To Be Heared Freestyle.

4,Colorized Box Art is Stupid,This is a fine early Marx Brothers movie. But I hate that the video release dunces always put colorized pictures on Black & White movie packaging. This is an old black & white movie. Please don't try to mislead us with the colorized pictures!!
5,Funny classic,I purchased this for my mom for Christmas. Not sure how the quality is but I don't think it makes a difference since this is a great movie!
3,"Very instructional, but terrible editing","I found the book very instructional for an intermediate player. On the negative side, I was annoyed by the incredibly large amount of typos, from the ""about the author"" page througout the book, there is a typo or a diagram error almost on every 2-3 pages."
3,"OK, but not Robertie's best","I'm glad I read it, but it's not Robertie's best work. The author chose good games for analysis, each interesting in a different way and all illustrating common problems. There are typos everywhere, though, both in the text and the diagrams."
5,CHANGE,This one was my first book in my backgammon studies and it becames my turning point into a serious player in the netgammon site.
1,Missing pages,"Does anyone else have a copy that's missing pages? Mine jumps from page 326 to page 339, and from 350 to 363"
5,"Birds can fly, why can't I?","As a grandmotherI browsed through the book, read the first chapter and found myself eager to read the next. To most of us, flying will always be a mystery; yet the baby bird pushed out of the nest is able instinctively to master this incredible skill. And every child would like to do the same. This book does not only stir the imagination, it provides some practical information along with suspense and entertainment. It will also create a new interest (for me as well as my grandchildren) in watching any birdsnest they suspect contains eggs. I would recommend it for any child--of any age."
3,I Have the POWER!,She-Ra is as great as I remember her and this was definitely a good purchase. Every episode starts off the same with the opening origin story and her turning into She-Ra. After the first few episodes you can try to find the cute little blue haired guy and he will show himself at the end and give the moral to the episode.I only have a couple issues with this dvd set. The major one is that the episodes are not in order once you get past the first few. It drives me crazy! If this was purchased for kids they probably won't notice.My other issue is that there are no extras. It would have been nice to have something in addition to the episodes themselves. But for $15 bucks I can let that go.I enjoyed this trip down memory lane so I will be buying Vol. Two.
2,"Once again, not impressed...","This book had many of the same recipes as the first Betty Crocker Slow Cooker cookbook--even the same pictures! The recipes are OK, but many are dull and made with prepackaged items. I'd rather know what's in my food, thank you. Not impressed. The new Southern Living Slow Cooker cookbook was a million times better."
5,Betty Crocker More Slow Cooker Recipes ( Hardcover-Spiral Edition),"Ordered 2 for Christmas gifts. Nice spiral notebook type books, but would have liked tabs like the older Betty Crocker cookbooks. Good books."
4,Excellent Cookbook!,"Easy and fast recipes for any working Mom or when you want to ""set it and forget it"" types of meal. The pictures of the dishes throughout the book made it more appealing for me. I found this book much better edition than the first Betty Crocker Slow Cooker book."
1,Wasted Potential,"I'd thought this book would be a lighter version of the Raj nostalgia classics, like 'Far Pavallions' or 'The Jewel in the Crown'. I'm not complaining about the pace of the book, which would be a little slow considering the fact that it's about a provincial town in British India. But it still could have been more interesting. Don't buy it."
5,Excellent biography,"Having read both Pollard's biography of Alfred and that of Abels, I much prefer the latter. Both try to bring Alfred to life for the reader but Abels brings more historical detail into the narrative and, to me anyway, less of an attempt to imagine often obscure motives or scenes. Also, unlike some biographies, the details in this book add to the narrative rather than distract from it. Abels is simply a very effective writer and historian who gives us what Alfred did in the context of a well-developed and well-researched setting. The writing flows smoothly and the reader becomes immersed in the times. I found Abels' biography to be an enjoyable reading experience about one of the pivotal people in Western history."
1,poor design,"DO NOT BUY! this table is not practical. the water side of the table is also the cover, it is VERY hard to set up for every use. even with the ""cover"" on water still gets in every time when it rain and the sand will get wet! don't bother with this piece of junk!"
3,"great fun,durable but hard to put together",my kids love it but it was a pain in the butt to put together plus the water area plug leaks a bit.
2,Keep shopping,"I am now shopping for a replacement. While is it durable, it is too difficult to put together and even when we cover the sand portion with the water part of the table rain gets in and you are left with a soupy sandy mess. Also, pass on colored sand. While it looks fun, you really notice sand goes everywhere, including somehow inside, when it is blue."
4,This is Laugh Out Loud Valby,"I have to admit, I love Valby's stuff. His amazing ability to lampoon songs, to come up with lyrics that rhyme, are ribald and side-splittingly funny, is second to none. Keep in mind his humor is not for the faint of heart. But, if you enjoy songs that are catchy, hilarious and extremely sexually graphic in nature, he's your man.The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is due to some of the audio problems with the CD. At times, it's tough to make out what he is singing because of the acoustics and recording quality.All in all, I highly recommend getting this CD."
5,Satisfied customer,It was what i expected. The packing was great and the quality was like brand new. I will order something else if i need to.
2,"maybe ok, if you haven't read Prospero's Children","I'm afraid that this book was very disappointing to me. I absolutely loved Prospero's Children, and I enjoyed Dragon Charmer, but I thought the author kind of gave up on this one. I really enjoyed Fern's strong character in the other books, but she seemed weak in the Witch Queen. The author had a good idea, but didn't follow through. The ending especially was not only a letdown, but also violated my idea of fair play in books. It was almost as if the author just got bored and couldn't think of ANY other way to end it. Without giving away too much, I think that's all that I can safely say.Just a warning, Witch Queen is not of the same calibre as Ms. Siegal's other books."
2,boo,"I really liked the first two books of the trilogy, but Witch Queen was a dud. I think Jan Siegel should've ended with Dragon Charmer; no need to drag it out with a third book. Witch Queen felt like a half-hearted extension of Dragon Charmer--flogging the dead horse of the Morgus conflict. Nothing really new happened, and the ending was VERY disappointing."
2,Going through and watching 70's television,"This one does not age well. I know it is for kids, but I just could not get through all of it."
4,Kroft Brother Morning Hits DVD,"Got this for someone as a gift, we both grew up in the 70's and it was the perfect thing to get... What great memories!!!!"
4,Sid & Marty Krofft,This is a great DVD to watch and relive my childhood. I wish they would bring out a Krofft Superstar Complete Series though so I can get all the Elektra Woman and Dyna Girl and Wonderbug Series!!
4,"It's just so money, baby.","This is a great companion piece to the film. The screenplay differs slightly from what is spoken in the film, but this is what Favreau originally wrote and is why the movie came about. The introduction, rules, and glossary are all nice added features."
2,Yuck. By far the worst of the clanbooks.,"The art was quite terrible. The book seemed to exist only to produce warped and twisted images and ideas. That's the point of the clan, I know, but I think that abandoning some of that (not ALL of it, mind you) would have helped the book immensely. I guess I just wanted to see more in-depth stuff that WASN'T the sort of stuff I've already seen in-game from the Tscimize. And, I HAVE to say it again, I can still smell the art from here."
4,Great clanbook but not that perfect,I must agree with the other reviews that this is a twisted clanbook. Great writing all the way. The only letdown was the art. Though I think that its good(from Ars Magica Maleficum). I think that the clanbook would have benefited with more artists(and more atmosphere of course).
3,No wonder they are hated,"If you're a Camarilla player who ever thought that ""Hey, maybe they aren't so bad,"" you'll definitely change your mind after reading this. It a disturbing account and I know my characters are going to destroy them with extreme prejustice whenever possible- or run away."
3,Ready for 9th...,"Would've liked to have read more concerning the new love interest. Maybe it was too steamy and edited out, but it was left hanging. Otherwise, this book left me ready for the next. Maybe we'll learn more then."
4,Well-chosen Budgie box set,"""Ecstasy of Fumbling"" is a nicely designed box set for the Budgie fan who may be thinking of upgrading some of his vinyl to CD. The entirety of the first CD and some of the second is devoted to the first five albums. With the onset of ""Impeckable"" Budgie's recordings deteriorated in quality rapidly. Bassist Burke Shelley explains they became better musicians about that time. Go figure, the better they became, the more polished the sound, the more they lost the metal brutality everyone loved. Anyway, the prime cuts minus the dross from ""Bandolier,"" ""Squawk,"" ""In for the Kill"" and ""If I Were Britannia"" are here. After the first five it's forgettable except for the mildly amusing tales of ""Panzer Division Destroyed"" and ""Forarm Smash."" Budgie apparently never lost its taste for absurdly great titles; what it lost was the talent for producing the raw heavy metal that fit them. -- Dick Destiny"
4,Good compilation,"I generally don't buy compilations, but this one here is very good and well produced by Repertoire.BUDGIE is the perfect example of hard, raw, muscular British hard rock of the seventies. Their first five albums are still considered their best, when they had guitarrist Tony Burges. Some of the more recent material was decvently good, but did not find their way to the hearts of fans.So, BUDGIE is the perfect example of a band that, if you do not know it yet, you should buy a compilation first, to check if you wanna buy some other albums by them."
3,a few missing links,"could have used more of the earlier songs like i ain't no mountain, zoom club, wondering what everybody knows, etc. i hardly ever listen to disc 2, but disc one would be worth it at a lower price."
1,Cheaper at Aiptek's webpage,"This is a bad business move on part of Adesso. Not only is this tablet ANCIENT, but Aiptek sells the exact same tablet (sans an Adesso logo), over on their website, for $79, instead of over $100.Don't buy it here, buy it there. As for the product itself, though, it's not that great. If you've never used any other tablets, you could get used to it, but between me and a friend, we've gone through a couple of these, and they are simply not that fantastic. I'm going to try genius tablets now. And if those fail me, well... I'll return it and get a wacom. 30 days is more than enough to know if a tablet works well, and although I have a sneaking suspicion that wacoms are over-hyped, over-priced tablets. They're real nice and all; I've fiddled with a few, but I just can't see spending $600 on a table that's the same size as this one, when this one is $79 somewhere. I mean we ARE still ultimately talking about the same technology."
2,doesn't work with 64bit Lion,"I purchased this product for my MacPro and it doesn't work as suppose to. I tried to contact the manufacturer to find out why, but is SOOOOOO hard to get tech support."
4,"Good pad, crappy pen, crappier mouse","Daughter is graphic artist and is very happy with this product. The pen is very cheaply made and within 90 days had to buy replacements (sold on the web for 9.99, so we bought two and paid shipping once). Mouse was cast aside from day one as it tends to interfere with the operation of the tablet (making the pointer jump around, etc)."
4,Good Product,My artistic abilities leave something to be desired but that is no fault of this tablet. It is definitely easy to use and works well. I feel confident that it will help me improve my drawing skills.
3,Not for current photoshop,"This works with some applications, but so far drivers do not support use with Photoshop CS2. Support is non-existant.The stars I give are because it has a large surface area and I can draw with big flowing lines. It's also 100's of dollars cheaper than the ""other"" tablet. This tablet is the same as many other brand-name tablets if you take a look at their home sites and look at photos, so finding one where the company has better support might be an idea."
1,DON'T BUY ME,I suggest NEVER buying an Adesso product...The product I bought NEW came USED... not with all of the pieces... and then afterwords they wouldn't even let me return it. Want to try talking to a customer service rep? Go ahead and try calling any one of their business numbers... because not one of them is going to be answered.
4,Big but it works,The tablet is big so it can be hard to store. the drivers work well with Photoshop CS and I'm happpy with it. This Tablet is good for beginners. Tilt sensitivity would be nice though.
1,Annoying behavior !!,"After trying with various PCs and various drivers, I came to the conclusion that this tablet doesn't work. The mouse pointer jump on all the screen, the tablet is crazy, and make rare commands, very annoying behavior. Don't buy, keep your money and add a few more dollars to get a wacom 6x8, trust me.Don't buy it."
2,Useless after pen tips wear out,"I bought this tablet for my daughter a year ago. The tablet works well and she loves it. The pen is a little fragile at the joint between the two halves, but the problem with this tablet is the pen tips. The replacable pen tips are not available anywhere. When you wear out the tips that come with it (3) your only option is to buy a new pen for $20. It comes only with the tip that is installed in the pen. I have corresponded with Adesso and they told me the replacement tips are not available. If you want to buy a tablet, check to see if you can get replacement tips before you buy."
4,Best for the Money,"The Tablet is great. It's 12 x 9 for half the price of the other brands! I find that its easy to use and install. The mouse is pretty much useless though. If you're looking for a tablet this is the one, for beginners and pro. (the 4 stars is for the useless of the mouse and the button on the pen)."
2,Works great. . . until you run out of pen tips. . .,"This product is great until it runs out of what I call pen tips, for lack of a better name.Pen tips are small plastic tips that one puts in the pen after it wears down you replace it with another.I've used this table over and over again without a problem. Now I can't use my last pen tip. Looked all over the internet (even the Adesso website) to find said tips. I was even looking to buy another pen for it if necessary. I found nothing. I fear I am going to have to buy another table.That's the reason for the two stars. Don't buy this unless you want to buy another after the tips run out.Like I said, the product works well it's just what's the use in buying something that doesn't sell replace pen tips or pens?If anyone out there knows of a place where I can find said pens or tips for this product please comment on this review and give me the link."
2,Amazon:Solar Pest repellant.,"When I ordered this item I read 'glowing' reviews. I ordered 2 at $8.48 each...when IT arrived I had one item @ $16.97...I did not print off my order on the order page, was not given that option, and did not notice that when the email arrived it had 1 @ $16.97. I checked back in today when one item arrived to see why I only got one...reread the reviews which is mostly complaints about this item. I am going to try this item out but will not buy anything else from Amazon until I have the option to print out my order page online and not have to depend on the 'email' to see how my order was set up. This is the first time I have had a problem ordering on Amazon...it will be a long time, if ever, that I order from Amazon again. I will review again when I have tried this item out for a week.Buying this mole repellant seems to be a bad idea as the reviews, now that I have the repellant, are pretty bad."
1,They'd have to work first...,"Most other reviews claim that these don't repel the moles/gophers, but I wouldn't really know...as two of the three units I purchased didn't work coming out of the box. The one that did work barely makes a noise. Stay away from this product!"
1,Failed,"I purchased the above item (smart solar 0400rm1 solar mole and gopher chaser) from Amazon. It was shipped on September 22, 2011. Unfortunately it has failed because of filling with water. You can even see the water inside over the solar cell. Obviously, it has leaked around the seal for the solar cell. According to your advertised features, of is supposed to be waterproof (which it must be!)."
1,"Not sure it ever worked, but then it died.","When I installed the Chaser in my back yard in December, a slow season for moles, it was difficult to tell if it actually repelled the little pests. However, at least I could hear it emit a sonic pulse about every half minute or so - it was making an attempt to work - and time would tell if the moles moved out. Now it's the end of April and the moles are still around. Moreover, I was doing some yard work in the vicinity of the Chaser but could not hear a peep out of it. I had my wife, whose hearing is better than mine, confirm the silence. So, bottom line, it didn't work long enough for me to determine if it would actually chase my moles away. I would return it if I could, but, unfortunately, the window of opportunity for that has closed."
1,Solar Mole & Gopher Chaser - High Failure Rate,"We purchased five of these units and sadly report that three of these units have already failed after a month of use.They have a solar cell on top which powers a burst of 400 Hz sound every 30 seconds. They use no batteries. A great idea but I just wish they were reliable.They only come with a 6 month guarantee - that's the first RED FLAG.. Only one season of use and they write off their responsibility.. Also the instructions state that the unit is not water resistant and it's not sturdy enough to withstand freezing temperatures!! - (""Remove the unit from the soil if the ground freezes or when flooding occurs)"""
3,Seems to work,"I had moles digging up my garden, so i got a pair of these and stuck them at opposite corners of my vegetable bed (it's only 4 feet by 15 feet - one stake should have been enough, but i decided to err on the side of overkill). From then on, no more moles.I can't swear the spikes are what scared them off, but it would be an odd coincidence otherwise.The only problem i have with them is that they are not quiet. I can hear them from 100 feet away, especially on quiet summer nights that i'd like to spend sitting in my back yard. So yes, they kept my vegetables safe from moles, but they also kept me out of the yard a lot too."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! IT DON'T WORK!!!,"BOUGHT 2 OF THESE, PLACED THEM AS DIRECTED AND GUESS WHAT? THE MOLES MADE RUNS RIGHT WHERE I PLACED THE ""MOVER"". DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
2,Wasted Money,"Complete waste of money. The moles still dig mounds about 2 feet from the device. In order to keep the moles out of your yard, place them on a grid approximately 2 feet apart. That is just about as attractive as mole hills. I bought 4 items and they all still make the buzzing sound. I guess moles are deaf and cannot hear the sound. It really doesn't seem to bother them much."
2,It buzzes,"But that's about it. Apparently, the gophers just choose to ignore it. I've moved it around but they aren't leaving."
2,Solar gopher and mole chaser,I used them for a while and it seemed to help some. Later they seemed to be ignoring it. After about a month one quit working completely. Probably won't recommend.
2,Unhappy with product,this product didnt meet up to my expectations the Gophers were 2 to 3 feet away from where I put the solar mole system
1,Smart Solar 0400RM1 Solar Mole and Gopher Chaser,"WASTE OF MONEY / DONT BUY. What a waste of money. I had moles in my backyard and decided to try this product. After recieving it, the product was easy to install. I went to the backyard and found the most recent mole hole and stuck the device in the hole. The next morning the mole dug holes 1 foot from the device. Tried it several time in different parts of the yard and still no good results. WASTE OF MONEY"
1,Smart Solar Mole Chaser,"So I previously had a Smart Solar 0400RM1 Solar Mole and Gopher Chaser. It lasted about 2 years and did the job. What I found was that once you have moles/gophers, these things won't get rid of them. But they usually leave in teh winter, and if you ahve it in place in spring, it will prevent them from coming back.Anyway, I had the Smart Solar and it worked for a coupel years and finally gave up. So I ordered another one, but what came from Amazon was ""Solar Powered Mole Repeller"" from HLA. This thing looked similar, thought the stake was little longer and thinner, but it only lasted about 2 weeks before dying. I don't recommend it. Get the Smart Solar instead."
4,Worked for me,We had some Gopher's that teared up the lawn in the backyard. Put this out in the backyard and it has solved the problem. This device is audible to the human ear. It isn't super loud but I can definitely hear it in the back yard. Seems like it is a little flimsy but it is working. I am debating whether to take it inside for the winter at this point.
1,Not worth the money!,"I own 6 of the P3 mole chasers that are D cell driven, they work perfect. But battries run out between 4 and 5 months, then D cells are not cheap so I was looking for the same quality at the P3 and bought 10 of these to replace the P3 and battries. They are garbage and only have a small sounders in the units which might scare off a Vole/Mole if it was right under it. Save your money"
5,Big Star Wars Feet To Fill !!!,"I just picked this up cheap.I was expecting a Hot Wheels size MF.There was a large box, so I thought the person packed it well.Wrong ...There were 3 ultras in the box, & 3 3.75"" figures.It was my lucky day.The model is as large as a breakfast plate.It's major cool like it's been through space.It's 50-50 metal & plastic.The moving parts are:radar dish - side to sidetop gun - rotatesbottom gun - rotatescockpit - ragtop ... LOL ... 455 air anyone?seating area near top gun - opensdoor - pivots2 rear landing gear - push in / outfront landing gear - pivotsThere's also a keg in the kitchen.JKGotta get outa here ... Vader's coming.WHOOSH!!!;)PS I was missing the display case for this item.I received the DV TIE which had it.VERY DISAPPOINTED ...The case arrived scratched up & needs major buffed.I do know how to restore it, so ... elbow grease time"
2,high-falutin',"I found this book to be irritatingly snobbish, with names being dropped at every corner. The reader can glean a bit of modern Turkish history from this, but mostly it's a shallow account of a rich, aristocratic Turkish woman who ""chucks it all"" to become an actress in the US. Boring."
1,Extremely Dated,"Extremely dated. Published in 1996. Imagine if you still had a computer from 1996- how useful would it be? I wish someone would update this book but as it stands now, it is useless with the current applications of Blackboard. It doesn't even mention the ""Build, Teach, Student"" format."
4,Some Corrections,"The review by Someone's Mom appears to contain some factual errors. The banner feature is discussed on pages 75 - 76. Creating a learning unit is discussed on pages 98 - 100. Whether these entries would satisfy the previous reviewer is another matter, but the topics are addressed. There may be other errors as well in that review, but these two just jumped out at me. I agree that the authors couldn't seem to decide whether they wanted to write a technical book about Blackboard or a book focused on pedagogy and the use Blackboard. Nevertheless, there is useful content in this book, particularly for someone who is new to the use of course management systems."
2,Not useful,This book is already out of date Black Board is change all the time and simple operation seem to get more confusing as try to follow the steps to make routine things happen.
5,The Best Jazz Artist Still to this DAY,A great artist who still sounds new and freshTed Lewis is a wonderful showman and the sound of his music is FantsticI wish you sold more of his items.
4,A Joy Recharge,"The first three chapters alone are well worth the price. Dive in with an open mind. I usual wince when authors are out to save the world (the last statement in Chapter 1 is ""The healing of ourselves, of each other, of our children, and of society begins one bond at a time."") but I put that aside and really was moved by the view the author gives.I put ""Noticing"" (pg 31) to the test immediately, and was amazed at the reaction from my 2 year-old (a recent adoptive placement) as well as a young playmate in the park (his dad was busy chatting on his cell phone). Using her technique defintely brought a more relaxed and joyful response than ""yeah, great!"" and the other examples she gives of typical parent responses.That said, I haven't made much use of the rituals. Most are beyond the needs of my toddler, and I haven't found one I was willing to try with my 11 year-old."
5,It Works!,"I am a Kindergarten teacher and a grandmother. I have used many of the simple games and techiques suggested in this book on my grandchildren, and with my students. It never ceases to amaze me how such tiny, seemingly insignificant gestures and touches can have such a profound effect on young children. My K students will beg for these gentle games over and over - never tiring of the eye contact and affirmation they receive from them. The author's rationale is well documented. It makes a wonderful gift for new parents."
5,Great reminder,"I do a lot of the things in this book this naturally, but it has some cute ideas; and when you are burnt out, you can just open the book and use one of theirs. love it!"
5,I Love Your Rituals,A really great concept. Teaching children through play while building confidence & trust. Lots of fun games to play with your child.
5,"Low ""Content"" but LOTS of activities","This book is just what it claims to be in the title: a collection of rituals that reinforce messages of love and belonging. The explanation for the importance of said rituals is very brief. So, if you're looking for a book filled with substance and science, this isn't it. However, if you're seeking a wealth of ideas for finger plays and other sensory delights that provide opportunities to deeply bond with your child - this is THE book for you! Each activity only takes a minute or two so they are easy to incorporate into your day during transition times or moments of play with your little one. My happiest chilhood memories are of the simplest rituals my father used in play. I'm so happy to have found a book that helps me to create the same lasting memories for my own son."
3,"Not one of the best, but okay","On his way to Texas, Slocum is framed for a bank robbery that he couldn't possibly have committed because he was with the sheriff's wife who ain't talking. Lucky for him, Apaches raid the town which gives Slocum the opportunity he needs to escape. One thing leads to another and soon Slocum is in cahoots with the Apaches to get them ammo for their Sharps, but really to save his own hide and that of the sheriff's wife whom the Apaches took a liking to during the raid.This is an okay read that has good characterization, but a rather weak plot. Also, the dialogue varies from good to lame--the sheriff's wife don't come across as too believable from the words she lets go with. About mid-way through the book it begins to drag and you kind of think the ending is going to bog down into predictable mire. But, the ending actually redeems much of the book; it was really quite good in an ol' West kind of way.Recommended, luke-warmly. *"
4,Definitely Helps!,"This guide can be a pain but believe me it helps in this game it keeps you focused when you might be ready to throw in the towel because you don't know what to do, where to go, or who to see."
3,Decent.,"I like this CD but I don't love it. My favorite ISC album is ""Holy"" and than ""Mistrust The Angels"". The music on this album is electronic darkwave and aggro-industrial dance. For fans of DISMANTLED, FRONTLINE ASSEMBLY, and IMPERATIVE REACTION."
3,ISC!,"Lame name for an industrial band, but....decent music. Awesome album art and interresting sleeve design. There are a few great tracks on this CD but this is probably my least favorite album by ISC. If your new to ISC I suggest that you start anywhere else but here. Besides this album is an import and is way too expensive if you ask me."
3,Not Bad........,"Compared to many horrible horror movies I've recently watched, this movie isn't bad. Jolly Roger comes back from the dead to get revenge and he does. There were cool dying scenes and some gore which every horror movie needs. It was good enough to watch until the end without wanting to turn the movie off! For horror movie fans, I would recommend renting this film just for the death scenes. Jolly Roger delivers enough to keep you interested."
4,Needs a more simplistic approach,This is one of the few books available for CCRN certification. Practice exams cover too much material and may overwhelm you. The book should cover what you need to know instead of adding extra material that is not likely to be on the exam.
5,Warning: comes without cables!,"For example, you will need a Sennheiser CCEL190-2 cable to connect to standard phone. Do an Internet search and you will find [...]the only American reseller to advertise this critical cable (plus they sell the CC550 for less). You will also need a CEDPC1 to connect to a PC and they have a long list of others for commercial phone systems. Otherwise, this is one of a kind. I'm not hearing impaired, but especially since phone companies no longer work to ""hear a pin drop"" in addition to handsets not fitting against the head and headsets focusing first on being light, I've desperately needed something better. This is it. It certainly costs more than any other headset, but that's nothing if you spend hours a day on the phone."
3,Good but not outstanding,"Ultra low weight that makes it confortable to wear for extended periods of time, noice cancelling function very effective. However, no volume or mute button, connecting cable to order separately, I would have expected all this to be included considering the price tag. Sound quality when plugged to a PC is actually better on my Logitech wireless headset. I have been somehow disappointed by the 'sound experience' of the Sennheiser, I was perhaps expecting too much.."
1,Don't waste your money,I spent extra on this headset because it was suppose to reduce background noise. Doesn't work any better than a thirty dollar model. Very disappointed.
1,Do not let the photo fool you,"This headset does not cover your ears. It sits awkwardly on the head. I'm not sure why they call this an XL Ear Cap, unless of course you have ears the size of a marmot. I know someday someone will make a great headset. This is not it."
4,Good,"This DVD has 2 workouts on one disk.The weightloss workout is and older video the moves are a little more varied.The second workout was actually one of my first leslie workout, it is also dated but the moves are little more varied.For those who don't understand LS fans she helps us to workout with out the stain.... it's all about moving the body"
5,exercise dvd,"The product arrived promptly, well packaged and in good order. It was as described and was not readily available in Australia."
3,Old and New together,"I enjoy Leslie Sansone's workouts and the Fat Burner 2 Miles is tough on the muscles but great.The 4 Miles is outdated. VERY 80s so good for a laugh. I guess the exercises are still okay but it'd be nicer if it was updated to a more modern exercise routine, outfits and music! I guess that the 4-mile wouldn't sell on it's own and that's why it is grouped with the much-better 2 mile workout."
2,SO SO Sansone,"I wanted some variety, but I was thrown back to 80's or 90's without warning. The exercises are effective, but DATED and not nearly as engaging as the Walk Away the Pounds 2 Mile and 3 Mile Fat Burner workouts. The program is SO SO dated, and that was extremely misleading to me. I was very disappointed, and I probably will stick to the 2 mile and 3 mile tapes. If I knew the actual date of the production, I would not have made the purchase."
1,NO!! Don't do it! Run away.....,"Waste of money. The release date is 2004, but the video was done some time in the last century. No wonder she looks so fit on the cover, the picture was taken 15 YEARS AGO!! No, the exercises haven't changed over the years, but the presentation has. This is all old video techniques and a very inexperienced and unpolished instructor who has gotten better over the years. How hard is it to make a new version? The music is very dated as well. Not fun, just boring."
3,from a leslie sansone fan....,"i am definitely a fan of leslie sansone...i have been using her programs for 18 months....i highly recommend them as easy to do, no equipment necessary, fun exercise....however, i would not recommend this particular dvd...it says it is from 2002 but it is really a compilation of exercise programs from the early 90's...it is very outdated and has lots of complicated aerobic steps which her newer programs do not use...i would recommend her ""walk away the pounds"" or the ""express"" dvd's as they are great..."
2,Missleading Copyright date,"I bought this DVD because of the 2004 Copyright date. I believed that with an '04 date the DVD would contain Leslie's current philosophy and approach. This DVD is primarily 90's footage with an '04 copyright cover. Now I feel I can't trust copyright dates to indicate current maerial. I anticipated Leslie's updated approach to cardio, stamina, and strengthening, not outdated instruction that my elbows and knees can't tolerate."
3,~Leslie Sansone~,"First let me say I love Leslie Sansone...I have more than a few of her DVD's and she's very motivational...Her DVD's are easy to follow and depending on the one you choose it will challenge you...This particular DVD looks like it was back in the 80's.....In this one she doesn't have the meter that tells how far you've walked...So, I didn't like that aspect of it...But, it is still a good workout..."
3,OK for beginners/light days,"This is a really easy workout if you are a regular exerciser. It is meant for people who are more out of shape or can't do regular cardio due to restraints from joints. It is very low impact. She uses a few key moves and changes them up, and adds arm movements.This DVD contains a 30 minute 2 mile walk and a 60 minute 4 mile walk.Leslie cues very well but can be occasionally annoying.One problem that I see with it is that one of the walks (i think it's the 4 mile) has sections and you stop between them for a few seconds."
5,Love It,I own several of Leslie's DVDs and I just purchased this one. Yes this tape is from the 90's but it is a great workout. I love the fact that it did not keep updating me everytime I completed a mile. The strength training at the end is super. I would not recommend this DVD to an overweight person or someone just starting out. When I got back into exercising her one and two miles were the best DVDs for me to start with. I am using her four and five mile DVDs now; between dieting and using her DVDs I have taken off 40 pounds. My clothes are now single digits. This was much cheaper for me than Jenny Craig or Weight Watchers and I can use these DVDs any time of day or night.
3,Leaked,"Loved the look of this tent.Went camping with my family in North Florida.Rained hard the first night and was very cold.We had a heater set up in the middle room.Rained poured into the tent so badly thatwhen we woke the middle room was floodedand we could have been electrocuted!Returned the tent and got my money back.Yes I had seam sealed all the seams, Yes, the tentcover was on. We had a tarp under the tent to protect the floorof the tent from rocks or other ground items. As taught by myfather the tarp was not exposed outside the tent edges but was insidethe parameters of the actual tent so that water doesn'tfalll and store under tent. The only thing I did not do was tarp the entiretent with an ugly tarp. What's the sense of buying a nice looking tentand then coving the whole thing with a huge tarp. It can always rainin Florida on any given night or day. This tent is only good for sunny weekends."
3,Wenger Appenzell 3 20- by 10-Foot 11-Person Three-Room Family Tent with Breezeway,WE LOVE THE TENT IT HAS SO MUCH ROOM IN IT. WHEN WE WENT CAMPING WE SLEEP ON ONE SIDE AND ALL 5 OF OUR KIDS SLEEP ON THE OTHER SIDE. THE KID WANTED TO SLEEP IN THERE OWN TENTS AND THEY ARE TO LITTLE TO SLEEP ON THERE OWN THEY ARE ALL BETWEEN THE AGE OF 3 AND 8. SO I SET UP 3 2 MAN TENTS ON ONE SIDE OF THE TENT AND MY QUEEN SZ AIR MATTRESS ON THE OTHER AND STILL HAD A LOT OF ROOM LEFT OVER. THANKS FOR MAKING A TENT BIGENUFF FOR MY FAMILY.
1,Never Again!,"I bought this tent only because the one I truly wanted from Cabela's was on back order for 4-5 weeks. I should have waited. This is a nice size tent. There, the good things are said. All four corners leaked on the first use, as did 6 seams. Although there are lots of screens for ventilation, the fly does not allow it. Poor design on the back awning means that it falls down in the slightest breeze, blocking the vent screen. The doors open from the bottom, where the rain comes in. So, if you want ventilation during a rainstorm, prepare to be wet. Or hot if you don't like wet. This tent was a MAJOR disappointment and got returned immediately upon completion of it's first use. I got back on the waiting list for Cabela's big tent!!!"
4,perfect size,"When I purchaced this tent, I was not at all sure I would like it. When I used it I found it easy to assemble, spaceous and durable. I have been tent camping for years and in the past ten years I have involved my young children. Most of the tents do not survive them. I can tell by the zippers and material that this one will survive. I am very impressed."
2,A musical marvel - technical disaster,"I just want underscore the well-summarized review that Sixties Music ""stereo fan"" gave this release.Musically, this is arguably Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass' finest material. If you haven't audtioned this music, I hope that you give it a go. I feel the highlights are ""South Of The Border"", ""The Girl From Ipanema"" [yes, there really is such a place], ""Up Cherry Street"", and ""Mexican Shuffle"" (which you may remember as 'Teaberry Shuffle', made popular by a 60's TV ad for chewing gum).Technically, if sound quality is important to you, you're likely to be disappoined in this release. Not only does it suffer from the lack of bass that I know should be there (based on my orignal release recordings), what bass is there, is troubled by IM distortion. And, then there's the issue of ""Mexican Shuffle"": it's in mono."
4,South of the Border,"After a slightly dissapointing album, Herb Alpert was back on the charts with this album. During the sessions for this album, the song Mexican Shuffle, was picked up and used for a tv gum commercial. This put Alpert's sound back on the map.At this time, Lonely Bull was his only other hit, and people thought the sound of the Brass was over. Mexican Shuffle is featured on this album. It is the only hit here, but the rest of the album is very good. For the first time, Alpert demonstrates his knack for arranging, taking a completely left turn on Antonio Carlos Jobim's classic Girl From Ipanema, and The Beatles' All My Loving. Overall, the mexican feel is still evident in this album, perhaps the last album that would showcase this.This is an enjoyable album from start to finish!"
3,"+ 1/2 stars...Worthy Successor to ""The Lonely Bull""","While not quite as good as Herb Alpert's debut, 1965's SOUTH OF THE BORDER was a solid album that went to No. 6 on the album charts. Shout! Factory has done a nice job of remastering and the accompanying booklet is very informative. Highlights include the title track, ""The Girl From Impanema,"" the reworking of the Beatles' ""All My Loving"" and ""The Mexican Shuffle,"" which was the only hit single off the album (peaking at No. 85) but it was given new life when used in a chewing gum commercial and redubbed ""The Teabury Shuffle."" In fact, the only real clunker is the vocal track ""Hello, Dolly!"" with its out-of-place Spanish accent. This album was originally released in February of 1965; three months later Alpert would release his first No. 1 album WHIPPED CREAM AND OTHER DELIGHTS. Shout! Factory has scheduled an April release for that gem. In the meantime, SOUTH OF THE BORDER makes for a nice appetizer. Enjoy! RECOMMENDED"
2,Not very SEAL-like.....,"I've been reading Keith Douglass's books since his first SEAL Team Seven novel and in my opinion, they have progressively strayed from a spec ops force to a more spray-n-pray team. He tends to have his team dropped in with some of the most obscure gear (i.e. the Bullpup) and takes away from the clandestine, silent professionals that SEALs are. I would suggest he go back to the originals and start from there. Keep it more realistic in ops planning and equipment, and slow the pace down and increase the intensity of the operations they perform. Take some time to show the teams different abilities and their talents as Naval Special Warfare personnel. These guys are more like Rambo laying down a field of lead instead of the precision SEALs are known for. Give them the gear the typically use - body armor, MP-5s, M-4s, balaclavas, etc. Drop the futuristic weaponry like the EAR or the Bullpup. It takes away from the fun and authenticity."
1,please.... stop...,"i couldn't even get through the 2nd chapter... i started reading this one after the carrier joint operations. i wonder why they can be called joint operations if there is no actual interaction between the characters from the books. the story jumps from place to place. the time frames seem off, and the story seems impossible. the transistions are rarely there, and you can hardly follow the action. earlier books were great. stay away. please, i want to read the books that he put out there before. not these new manufactured stories."
2,Weird writing style,"I did not really enjoy this book. Douglass' writing style is kind of strange to me. The pace of the book is much too fast. By this, I mean that things happen way too quickly as if we are in a time warp. An action that should take a few paragraphs to accurately describe is usually taken care of in a sentence or two. I am a person that likes to have very nice, wel rounded descriptions about what is happening and this book just did not satisfy that requirement for me. It seems like his earlier books were a little better at that. This book seems like a jumbled flurry of activity that just doesn't pay enough attention to detail or description. I just like every move in tactical warfare to be painstakingly described as that is what brings enjoyment for me as a reader as I visualize it in my head."
4,works great,when I opened packaged I thought it might be in for a long afternoon.But it wasnt as complicated a project as I thought
4,Very funny,"This is one of my comic collection's best, along with chasing dogma. This is a very very funny comic book, with the same humor as the movie. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because the funeral comic didn't make much sense in context of the movie. Why would Dante get so mad at randal if it was somewhat his fault too? The first comic in this though was well worth the price."
5,Hoo Boy This is great,"'Ello, i gave it a rating but i havent read it but ive heard great Things about it. im a die hard kevin smith fan and when i get it and read it i will probably give it FIVE stars. well i loved the movie but i heard this is better."
2,Old and dated.,"If you are a big Hammond fan, go ahead and spend your money. If you just like Top Gear, skip this one. It's old and dated."
4,Hamster Tracks,"I bought this book because I'm a huge TopGear fan. I know very little about cars and I mainly watch the show for the crazy stunts and the silly gags between the guys. Richard Hammond's Car Confidential is pretty much like watching one third of the show (I guess I should have one of Jeremy's and James' as well for the full effect). He's funny and charming in his narrative, presenting everything from the ugliest car to weird trivia facts. I laughed out loud while reading his driving etiquette chapter and I loved the lists of Top Tens he gives. Maybe of his pop culture references are Brit based so they passed right over my head but I still found this to be a fun book. I'm glad I bought it, its a good alternative to when BBC America isn't showing back to back episodes of Top Gear."
3,Adrian Shaw - 'Head Cleaner' (Rubric Records) 3 1/2 stars,"For those of you who may've NOT known,Adrian Shaw had been in a couple of notable UK bands.He is a past member of the Crazy World Of Arthur Brown,was on Hawkwind's 1977 'Quark Strangeness And Charm' album and tour,plus most recently a vital member of Bevis Frond.'Head Cleaner' is what I would describe as semi-indepth psychedelic.Does that make much sense? Best tracks here were ""Symbiosis"",the wailing ""Staring At The Sun""(good guitar riffs),""Round And Round"",""All In The Mind"" and ""Things I Learned"". Didn't have a line-up of players,but I've found the following musicians do appear on this CD,Adrian Shaw (of course), Nick Saloman, Tony Hill and Bari Watts. Who plays what? A decent pick."
5,great quality - fast service,"great quality - fast service. Will be great for travelling! It has LOTS of pockets, even a little mesh one that is stored away at first but you can pull out of a zipper and then have a water bottle in it..."
1,Horrible!,"I am a fantasy book lover. I am very easy to please, but this book starts out good, then gets a little poor. But the real tragedy is the ending. It's a perfect example of the author either growing tired of writing the book and throwing a very bad ending together or suffering from writer's block and throwing a very bad ending together. I hate to say this about a book, but this one was actually a waste of my time."
4,auto lock,"This autolock did not fit onto my 2007 Toyota Tacoma, was looking foward to using it , but the clutch pedal was too thick for the autolock to fit onto."
3,3.5 to be precise,"Sector is from the mind of Dean Dennis, ex Clock DVA. To me, this is a more streamlined version of ideas put forth on Industrial Cosmetics, and better than Macula Orange. Is Adi Newton on speaking terms w/ Dean? Will Clock DVA proper release any of the purported backlog of material (indicated since 1994)? In the meantime, this may suffice. No offense meant, but as instrumental material goes, Digital Soundtracks by Clock DVA is superior. However, this is way above average in the techno-industrial field."
2,stretchy but leaky,Forceflex bags aren't bad for stuffing with dry trash but not great for kitchen/food garbage. When they stretchedthey had a tendency to leak.
5,Only vinegar based dressing I have ever liked!,"I have never liked a vinegar and oil type dressing before. And to have it made from organic, good for you ingredients is just a huge bonus. It is really helping me with weight loss. I look forward to my two salads a day!"
1,gross,Tasted horrible . It made me want to puke. Totally riuned my salad. What a waste.I cant believe I wasted my money on this and none of my friends that tried it liked it either.
2,Prima strategy guide for Guild Wars Factions,"This is a product you don't need to spend your money on.If you - like me - played the original game and bought the Prima guide and liked it - then you're probably moving on to Factions now and thinking about buying the new guide. Do move on to Factions, but don't buy the guide.As a more experienced player you don't need the basic stuff anymore and a lot of the advanced stuff you'll be looking for (where to capture elite skills, which bosses drop which green items) you won't find.What's more alarming is that even a lot of the stuff that was good in the old guide is gone. The new maps are poor (the collectors aren't marked for example) and the general description of the game is poor.The only worthwhile thing in the guide are the skill lists and even these are dated because Anet changed a lot of the skills recently (so no fault to Prima, but it still makes the guide less useful).So this product is a no go unfortunately."
1,Pointless to buy -- information quickly is out of date,"If you have played Guild Wars, you probably already know that the game is constantly being updated. That makes strategy guides like this one pretty pointless. Even worse, there are plenty of websites dedicated to keeping this information up - for free. Google it, I use guildwiki.org for my information and it's 100% free and updated by players frequently.Don't waste your money on this guide. This is why people created fan websites!"
3,GW Game Guide from bad to worse,"Okay, base on comparsion on last chapter of Guild Wars game guide to this one, all I can say in is that this game guide was even worse than the last one. You can tell by just looking at the table of content.The following information that is lack from this game guide:Poor layout on the table of contentPull-out Map of Cantha did not even showed the name of each explorable area.Skill listing was okay except the layout was harder to look at it than the original Guild Wars game guide.Missing information on merchant item and incorrect information on the cost of Guild cape.Some of skill information was already outdated the date Factions released.Anet said they had someone write this game guide this time instead external writer, perhaps they should let external writer do it. Like what people say ""leave it to the professional""."
1,lame lame lame and again LAME,"I have NEVER been very impressed with the PRIMA guides and this is just another crummy example of what a terrible job they do, particularly with Guild Wars. I once bought one of their e-book versions and their stupid piracy protection was so hokey I ended up getting my money back. The content is very superficial. While they do a reasonable job of listing all of the skills and mobs in the game, if your hoping for some actual helpful hints on how to beat that tough mission (especially if your going at with just henchies), this guide is of zero use. There is practically no real mission specific information or hints. You would be much better off going to guildwiki or guildwars.gameamp.com or tentonhammer or just googling for what your after. You'll get much better information then this guide will give you."
2,Average content,It is not worth buying it. There is nothing additional that you can find over the internet sites such as Wiki. Besides that the content gets outdated quickly due to ANet's periodical updates.
1,This Guide is Sooooooo BAD!,"The Prima guide for Guild Wars Factions was the worst game guide book I've ever seen Prima produce. Don't waste your money -- in fact, don't even waste your time reading it if someone gives you a copy."
4,"Lost, But Found in Factions","I found the game, Factions a little confusing to follow. What quest would lead me to the end of the game or how many towns were left in the campaign.I bought Prima game guide, from the first page, which is the map, I began to understand what towns I missed and what quest I needed to finish the game. Very informative guide, great addition for the guild wars fan."
3,Warped tray,"Bought this to replace an identical version that fell on the floor and cracked into many pieces. (it's made of melamine ... it happens) It was old but I liked the tray. Got a replacement but this one does not sit flat on a table surface. Warped. By the time I pay to ship it back I decided to live with it, but the Chinese didn't do a very good job on this tray."
4,Good Advice,"This book has some really good advice, but it is jam packed and hard to follow at parts. Is a good book for teachers that want to improve their classroom management."
3,not bad,"this is 1 of 2 books that was actually semi-useful and decent throughout my teacher licensure program. while a chunk of it was purely common sense, it did provide some useful and insightful information and tactics on classroom management"
2,overpriced textbook,"The paper of this book is of mediocre quality. I splashed some water on a corner of a page and wiped it immediately; yet the page shriveled and the print faded nearly to illegibility.The content itself is reasonably organized, but doesn't break any new ground."
1,Have not received package after 3 weeks!,Don't know what to do--Ordered this book at the beginning of the month and have not received it. How to I go about finding out how to get reimbursed or find the package if it's lost in the mail? Thanks!
3,just a book,This book is ok but we didn't even really loke at it for our class. The seller was selling as new but it was not. It was highlighted and bent but oh well it was cheap.
1,Beware of seller nathan dalton,"Nathan Dalton sold us this product. Previously, I had bought several products from Amazon with great success. Nathan Dalton claimed one page would be missing. Eleven pages were missing from parts of two chapters, making the book useless as a class text, which we bought it for. Nathan Dalton would not respond to our request for money back. He is a liar and a con. Another review of him shows his arrogancy. He will sell you books with missing pages at full price. You won't get satisfaction from him. Buyer beware! I am considering filing a claim with the Better Business Bureau about this charlatan. He makes Amazon look bad."
5,Hallelujah!!,"Take it from someone who has been chewed up and spit out, but still surviving in the trenches, this book is a must read for anyone who dreams of a better life in La-La Land. Who let the dogs out? God. And they all reside in Hollywood. This hilarious handbook/'bible"" should be passed out to everyone who crosses the Los Angeles county lines. For those of you still brave enough to venture here, you've got brothers and sisters who feel your pain, so memorize it, sleep with it under your pillow, get the book on tape for godsake, but give yourself a leg up and order it for next day air."
5,Down and Dirty,I thought it was funny. Most of these How-to books are overly technical and dry. This had a good balance of humor and gossip and info.
5,Recommended STAT!,"Wow this book is a must have and one of your top priority of books and resources to buy if you want to become a Hollywood Assistant. The authors doesn't sugarcoat anything. They strip down the job as a Hollywood Assistant to the raw naked view. It has a bit of humor in it but all of it is true.As soon as I got this book I could not put it down and time went by so fast!If you are serious about becoming a Celebrity Personal Assistant, whether for a star, producer, director, agent, or studio executive, you must buy this book to know what to expect!They also include phrases to say, how to not lie but not tell the truth, what the phrases mean in Hollywood, and so much more!"
4,"Very Entertaining, Truly Horrifying","I'm an artist living in Chicago; I make $700 a month teaching. I would like more work, but I now know some work I would never ever want. The Hollywood life has never been tempting to me and this book has been wonderful in confirming why. I know that there are horrible people everywhere in America, but this book so nicely breaks down what is special about the horrible people in L.A. I especially like the section about L.A. neighborhoods, having just visited the place.More books need to be this kind of mean. Maybe this book should be a part of a series with the next one about the Publishing industry, then the Art Market, then the Fashion industry. You can get fired from any job for any reason if your boss is a big enough jerk. Just ask anyone who's worked for Vogue"
4,"Yes indeed, it seems folkes that 70 AD was indeed the 'End of the Age', not world.","I highly recommend Don K Preston'sbooks. I listen to Don on John Ander-son's Voice of Reason show, 9.330mhz, shrotwave one (also on gcnlive-dotcom), Sundays, 8-9 p.m. (The showin it's entirity runs from 7-11 p.m.Sunday nights, EST. All of Don Preston'sworks are outstanding. They 'Study toshow thyself approved of god'."
5,The best from the best,"I bought this CD after seeing them live -- see them if you have the opportunity.One of my all time favorite CDs. It's so good mainly because they're some of the best musicians around. The opening song, Down in the Willow Garden, is one of the most beautiful songs I've heard in a long time, followed closely by their their rendition of ""In the Pines"".If you like this genre of music, whatever it is, then you must have this CD."
5,Nice Book! (Especially syntax and News),"I was interested in this book from the beginning, and I wasn't disappointed. Though I'm basically a computer power user, this book offered tons of info I didn't know about Google."
1,What's next - an operating manual for my toothbrush?,"You've got to be kidding. I saw this and numerous other volumes at the bookstore about using Google and I laughed out loud. I had to pull this one off the shelf and see if it was a joke. After spending about 30 minutes flipping through it (that's about all it takes to get from front to back) I realized just how jealous I was becoming for not having thought of writing such a book first. The formula is simple - cull through readily available information on the Internet and repackage it in a friendly format for all the rubes with disposable income burning a hole in their pocket (come to think of it - isn't that the O'Reilly business plan?). What is so ironic is that Google was developed to be EXTREMELY easy - a true search engine for the masses. Its fundamental appeal is its ease of use, making guidebooks such as these silly at best, sad at the very worst. Take my advice, save your money and go treat yourself to a pizza."
4,Everything you need.,"This has been the first book of this type I have purchased, and I must say I was quite satisfied with it. It is a very simple and straightforward, almost modular approach to teaching hypnosis. It covers many aspects including an explanation, a history, recommended sessions, various scripts, success stories, and an introduction into more complex aspects of hypnosis, such as regression. Most importantly it is written in a very light and positive manor that, while still conveying the responsibilities and seriousness of the subject, leaves the reader feeling excited and confident. All things considered this book is exactly what it claims to be, a hypnosis manual for the beginner, and an excellent one at that."
2,I don't know about this book,"I tried some of the routines i read from this book on my brother. The book was interesting, but it still didn't work. It might if you try it a lot but I'm not sure."
1,There are betters out this. This book teaches bad habits.,"A book of very, very basic scripts that assumes way too much and teaches you bad habits for hypnosis. (It uses the beach metaphor way too much--what if the subject had a drowning experience?!?) The author also assumes: 1) the client will accept the standardized reality of the script and thus no one is unique, 2) you, as a hypnotist, know what to prescribe to the client (diet, exercise, etc.), and 3) the hypnotist does all the work and accepts 100% responsibility. And, the book does a poor job at explaining trance and hypnosis, even as a simple introduction. There are better books out there that teaches hypnosis. Look for a book by Hunter or, even better but a little more complex, Gilligan."
1,There should be a ZERO start rating!,"This book is awful! What else can I say?If you want an idea of what this book is really like, ignore all the obviously planted reviews and go straight to the book shop and review it yourself. His long-winded, disorganized, self-absorbed rant is a perfect example of what the book offers: amateurish poor quality. I would gladly have had understanding for an impassioned, inexperienced writer. But this writer's plea for ""positive vibes"" is hypocritical given the misleading, dishonest tactics he has used to promote himself. If at all possible, I strongly suggest that potential buyers borrow or review a store copy before parting with their money.This will only disappoint!"
4,Good place to start.,"Hypnosis for Beginners was a good place to start off with learning hypnotism. Hewitt explains a little bit about the history, and what is going on in the brain when hypnosis is induced. This book is directed more towards clinical/therapy types of hypnosis, however I added my own words to make it into an entertaining night with my friends. Hewitt's induction methods are good, but it is a lot of page turning to follow his lead. Hewitt has several scripts for specific therapy, and detailed instructions on self-hypnosis, also. Overall this is a good book if you want to learn to how induce hypnosis, but it does take a little practice and creativity so your ""victim"" is thinking about relaxing, and not how inexperienced you are."
2,Pretty Bad,"Well the author states that he wrote the book while in a deep hypnotic state- I think he meant while sleeping. This book seems to teach that scripts are all that you need and are all powerful. He mentions things and gives facts, yet does not back them up- eg. While your brain is in Theta, you can have psychic powers because I say so. Nore does he mentions some of the dangers (age regression is not always safe). I guess why he puffs himself up in this book, is because it is one big advertisement for another book he wrote. Worse, it really doesn't explain how hypnosis works. Thats all"
4,Hypnosis for Beginners by Hewitt,"The author describes the process of hypnosis and optimaltechniques for utilizing it in a variety of settings.Hypnosis is best achieved with deep relaxation and accompanyingbackground music to establish a receptive environment. The braincycles to an alpha level in the optimal hypnotic mode. The authors provide a plethora of hypnosis routines for utilizationin a variety of situations. Readers can practice these routinesto become thoroughly familiar with the techniques in implementation. Hypnosis can play an important therapeuticrole; however, it depends upon the cooperation and receptiveness of the subject. This work explains the techniquesin simple English with ample examples to demonstrate the concepts fully. The book is a solid value for the price charged."
3,Lacks basic undertanding of hynosis,"I bought this because I wanted to learn the basics of hypnosis, I find it a fascinating subject. This book was a bad choice in that regard. The author assumes that the same scenario or set up will work for everyone. There is limited flexibility in the author's approach. The mind is fluid, it wavers and wanders. What works for one will or might not work for others. Author misses this completely. There are boiler-plate scenarios for every session. Don't get me wrong, there is a chance it could work. But I find it impossible to believe that the same strategy or set up will work for all. I would recommend a different book that embraces the flexibility of the mind and incorporates that in sessions."
4,Quick prayer or verse to keep in mind all day.,i like that this is not something i have to read in order and if i have a minute i can read this for making a quick prayer or having a verse to keep in mind all day.
3,a mothers prayer book,"This book has different prayers for your kids life through difficult times, and easy times. It has prayers for wetting the bed, first day of school, first date, first day of college, and more."
1,Don't Like it. Generic.,Found the album generic sounding and uninteresting. Dull song writing/arrangements. Nothing musically inspiring or exciting.
2,Bible Knowledge=A - Scrappin' Knowledge = D-!,"I've been using this book as a resource for a Fruit of the Spirit Bible Scrapbooking Bible Study that I'm currently leading at our church. We have two weeks left. The Bible knowledge is super - but the scrapbooking ideas are pitiful. Basically, the author wants you to paste an 8.5""x11"" sheet of typed information on the middle of your page and slap some photos around it. No thanks!If you want to lead a study, my suggestion is to buy just one book and use the Bible information and verses. Then do the layouts as you please - you'll have fresher and more original layouts anyway! We even had a first-time scrapbooker in our group, and she came up with beautiful and original layouts withOUT using the scrapbooking suggestions provided in this book.I'm going to be posting all of my layouts on my Christian blog (everydayplaces.blogspot.com) for those interested in seeing what I came up with from this book."
4,Smooth sounds.,"Didn't know what to expect when I bought this CD. I had listened to two or three of the tracks (...) The more I listen to it, the more I like it. It's very different than many other electronica CD's out there, very moody, atmospheric, and lots of different flavors. Above all else, I think it's very smooth, not in terms of the mixing, but in terms of the listenablity of the tracks and the beautiful vocals on several of the tracks. If you get this CD, be sure to pick up it's sister CD, ""At Home at Sunset"". The pair make for excellent listening if you're trying to chill out, relax, cram for that midterm tomorrow morning at 9:00 AM, you get my drift ;) ."
2,Disappointed for an Amazon item!,"I purchased a Swahili-English Swahili Dictionary but found out that the book was no complete, as it missed more than 10 pages. I am actually in the process of returning in it because no replacement is possible. Anyway, I will try a similar item in the future. I know accidents may happen. Thanks."
4,"yes, but...","This is a great boogie rock CD and the other reviewer's cover it pretty well. The big question is where is the release of their 2nd and also best LP, 1971's ""Warm Slash"" ? Maybe a dual release of their self titled debut and Warm Slash is in order. It would certainly be welcome. Because as good as Buzzard/All Right on the Night is, the other two are better."
1,Beware watching this movie may cause impotency,This movie has to be the most boring movie that I have seen....absolutely no plot and cannot hold a viewers attention. Thank goodness for fast forward!Don't waste you time on this one.....can cause impotency as well.
5,awesome,"Heard him perform at Bluebird Cafe several months ago. Had to buy the album. Not only can he sing, he writes great music. Don't understand why some of the big names have not recorded some of Steven's music. Great great CD."
3,Not his best work,"I've read several of Robert Heilbroner's books and this one left me a bit disappointed. What I have appreciated in his other books is the way he gets to the point quickly, clearly and logically. This book is quick(short) but I left the book with the impression that it was just thrown together with the point of saying.. Capitalism is messy, it could survive (but not very long) and the greatest minds in economics think it's not going to survive. Well, that summed it."
2,A pessimistic view by an educated socialist,"21st Century Capitalsim, published in 1993, fails to capture the enthusiasm of current market trends. Heilbroner does present an interesting development of the different aspects of economies, ranging from Traditional (un-developed countries), Command (20th Century Communism) and Capitalism. He draws heavily from past economists such as Adam Smith and Keynes, but fails to support his predictions with recent examinations of the economy. Perhaps when he wrote this book, the US stock market had not fully rebounded from the 1992 recession. I would recommend this book for those seeking an extremely verbose and pessimistic view of future economics. For those who wish to read a book with a positive view of the future and some concrete suggestions on how to prepare for the revolutionary changes ahead, I would recommend Harry S. Dent JR's ""The Roaring 2000's""."
4,You're Only Lonely,"I thought this cd was very tastefully done. I have alway enjoyed his voice and these are very good,soft songs."
5,Raul Malo - You're Only Lonely,"I was a big fan of the Mavericks and had to drag my wife to a solo Raul Malo show in Niagara Falls, NY. I haven't been able to pry this or any other recording of his out of my wifes hands since. This guy has one of the greatest voices of all times, yet there are millions who have never heard of him. Terrific CD, terrific voice."
4,He Does It Again,"I have loved listening to Raul Malo's voice since I saw The Mavericks perform in 1995. Once again, he takes an incredible selection of songs and performs them with gusto.""The stellar selection provides a superb showcase for Malo's shimmering voice."" Well said."
1,A fresh CD by a Very Talented Singer,"Please EXCUSE the one star.I hit the wrong button and it won't let me change it.Please buy this cd,bring it home,throw on those headphones,close your eyes and enjoy!!!His voice gets better and better with each new cd and is a True Diamond in the Rough!!!!You won't find a better song writer,singer and performer than Mr Raul Malo!!"
3,"A+++ voice, B- material","Ralo Malo's rich, expressive voice is one of the great instruments in popular music. I've always believed that he can make even the most trite, hackneyes material sound beautiful.That theory is put to the test with Peter Asher-produced all-cover ""You're Only Lonely,"" which could be subtitled ""Raul Does California Mellow!"" Raul adds nothing to the J.D. Souther title track except, well, Raul's voice. And that's enough for it to work. The best track is Willie Nelson's ""Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground,"" where Raul captures the mournfulness and regret of this song. On the other hand, he adds nothing to his cover of the Bee Gees' creepy ""Run to Me,"" which was already beautifully sung in its original form.Not essential by any means. But not a must-avoid either. If you love Raul's voice so much that you don't mind it being used on B-grade material -- and, really, that's a very good attitude to have -- you'll be content that you added this one to your Raul Malo collection."
5,100% winner,"Love this CD! There isn't a tract on it that is below par. Raul Malos voice is simply beautiful, there aren't enough superlatives to rate this CD.Why Malo isn't a huge star baffles all of his fans. It would be wonderful if his music was featured on ""Dancing With the Stars"" so 20 million people could hear how beautiful his music is. I'm all for starting a petion to get this to happen!Everyone could use a little romance, and this CD is the most romantic ever."
4,Raul Malo,"Great listening CD. Raul Malo is at his best. Don't understand why they put the same song on the CD twice, even if one was a duet. Would rather have one more of a variety of that great voice."
4,Balladeer at his best,"Beautiful interpretations of ballads from a wide range of writers. Especially touching renditions of Nilsson's ""Remember"", Randy Newman's ""Feels Like Home"" and Willie Nelson's ""Angel Flying to Close to the Ground"". I would give the disk 5 stars except for: (1) Inclusion of the up-tempo ""For You"", co-written by Malo. Not a bad song or performance,but is jarringly out of place,and as a result comes across like something from Ricky Ricardo's Orchestra. (2) The second version of ""Feels Like Home"" with Martina McBride is unnecessary. Overall, a romantic disk that is a pleasure to listen to."
2,Disappointing - so middle of the road,"I love Raul Malo's voice - so plaintive, so sexy, so very expressive. But the longing and emotion he's capable of showing is not in evidence on this CD. Other than ""For You,"" this album transported me right to the Holiday Inn Airport Lounge and watered-down cocktails. So blah."
5,Oh Whata Voice,As always Raul's voice is at its best. He always leaves you wanting just alittle more to hear.
5,You're Only Lonely,"Raul Malo's Voice is out of this World. He is one of the greatest singer of all times. His years with The Mavericks were (well what can I say). I love this artist,and The Mavericks too. I've learn to play most of his songs on my guitar. I just had to make it with him because played my kind of rhythm. You're Only Lonely is his love for other artist song that he admirer. Keep it up Raul. I'm looking forward to the next CD. I'll see him at the Mohegan Sun this Month."
5,Wonderful,"This is what music should be & do-----take you away to another place and time. The first 5 songs are my favorite especially Willie Nelson's 'Angel Flying Too Close To The Ground'. I thought no one could ever touch Willie's versions, but I was wrong. Breathtaking."
5,Nothing short of outstanding....,"This CD should come with birth control!!! Long awaited by Malo fans, he delivers. The ultra-talented ex-Mavericks' frontman steps way, way out and leaves everyone else in the dust. Dare I say better than Orbison....there I said it (I don't regret it!!!). This one will not gather dust in your CD cabinet. Malo's delivery, especially on You're Only Lonely and At Last (that great Etta James chestnut), is something to behold. I even like the duet with Martina McBride (not usually a favorite). When you listen to this kind of music and then have to sit in silence for several minutes when its over, you have experienced greatness....no question....A must for serious music lovers and the mood music crowd!!!"
3,"yeah, it's ok.....","here we go again...Yet another fine singer trys to do the standards/Ballads thing. As you know, some of these American Songbook albums go well, some of them don't (remember Sinead O'Connor's big band album?). This one is best described as having 3-4 killer tracks, 3-4 pretty good ones and a couple of clunkers. (Wow, I never thought I'd hear Nillson's ""Remember"" ever sung again). Pick it up, I suppose it's worth it, but I have to say there are better Raul Malo albums (especially his last solo release)"
2,Disappointed,"Saw Mr. Malo on the Imus Show and loved what I THOUGHT was the album, however the pianist on the TV show was not on the record. I feel cheated.The recording itself is pretty good, but NOT as presented on TV."
2,Sub-par and disjointed,"Generally speaking, I am a huge Mavericks, specifically Raul Malo, fan. In fact, I might by a recording of him singing words out of the dictionary. That being said, this CD feels like is was done with the cruise control turned on. I have listened to this CD multiple times and if it wasn't for the song written by Malo himself, ""For You"", the cover of Willie Nelson's ""Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground"", and the duet with the amazingly gifted Martina McBride I would say this was a waste of money. The extreme talent that Mr. Malo displayed on his first solo effort Today, were seemingly left out of this disappointing disc. It felt a lot like the first time I heard the song ""Delores"" on the Mavericks Trampoline CD. This CD is a real head scratcher. I look forward to a collection of originals from an amazingly talented performer."
5,Love it,"the avengers were always my favorite comic book, it is great to have all of the information in one location"
4,"kyjagsfan,louisa,ky","Having once owned the color mags, it was like visiting an oldfriend you hadn't seen in a while...This was when I came toread and collect comics.The artwork was dazzling, stories werefast-paced.I couldn't turn the pages fast enough to find outwhat happened next. Granted by today's standards the storiesand art are dated, but this was the beginning for me. The onlydrawback is the lack of color, but still well worth time andmoney to visit with old friends."
4,good information,The magic is good and fun. The card tricks are neat.The party section is also recommended for families.
3,Biology SAT II,"The first two tests in the book are very helpful when it comes to preparing for the SAT II. They are the closest to the actual test (but slightly easier). The problem with the last three tests is the presence of bad questions, where the answer choices don't make any sense, or the book gives you the wrong answer in their answer chart. I would recommend buying this book just because the practice tests are close to the actual test."
4,Beautiful,"I bought this as a present for my mother after she heard one track on the radio (and after I read the other reviews). It's beautiful, and beautifully played. I can't say it's my usual preferred style of music, so it isn't quite 5 star material from me, but even for an uneducated listener such as myself, this is undeniably good stuff."
3,John performs with interuptions,"I purchased this video in hopes of seeing classic live performances by John winston ono Lennon. I had hoped to see them uninteruped. However every clip that was shown, was interupted by various coherts from the past who infringed upon the so called performaces with their opinions. I feel the poterntial purchaser should know what is in store for him, should he/she elect to buy this DVD. I wish I could gather together video performaces from John's all too short career in music. As is, what you get is a lot recollectins, yet not enough live performaces."
1,JOHN LENNON GETS HACKED UP,"I AGREE TOTALLY WITH TYRONE REX. I DON'T MIND A LITTLE COMMENTARY, BUT THIS WAS VERY ANNOYING. I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HALF OF WHAT THEY WERE COMMENTING ABOUT, AND WHAT YOU COULD UNDERSTAND WAS MOSTLY WORTHLESS BULL THAT YOU ALREADY KNOW.YOU GET A TASTE OF THE MUSIC, ONLY TO GET INTERUPTED EVERY 20 SECONDS BY SOME MARBLE MOUTH BORE.I WISH I READ TYRONES' REVIEW BEFORE BUYING THIS TEASE !I ONLY GIVE IT 1/2 STAR."
5,Outstanding Book on RAC,This is a complete reference that provides 100% business value to professionals using or moving to RAC.We have already used many of his scripts over the last two weeks in our test environment and has helped us move forward considerably. His internals chapter is excellent. Good work Murali. I highly recommend this book
2,not good grid and rac topics,I did not find the clusters information to be as deep as the Madhu Tumma book by far.I liked the Tumma book far better in my opinion.
5,Excellent book on oracle clustering,"One of the superb referance book on subject of Clustering technologies (a-z) for oracle . Writer has amazing grip on explaining very technical details in logical, simplistic and rational way. I would say this is a one stop clustering book which preety much covers all nitty gritty of Oracle clustering. This would be a library book for lots of good dba(s)."
4,Bachmann Crossing Gates & Signals- N scale,"These are pretty close to scale, while still being viable on a layout.They are not fragile, but durable. If truly scale, they would be much too fragile.The thing is they enhance operations on your layout. They are good enough that you can put them fairly close tothe tracks, as per the actual thing. I like this product."
4,title says it all,"this book told me what i already knew:that our animal friends are GENIUSES.the animals mentioned in this book:moths,insects,fish,turtles,deer,birds,frogs,and snakes have the know-how to hide themselves,or imitate something else inorder to survive in their' environment. animals want to survive just like we do!author lilo hess narrates this book and has used his own photographs(black/white).the photos are really good. these photos show a wide range of animal subject matter. the photos help in the learning process and are a great tool.this book is 64 pages long and includes an index. this book is for children oradults."
1,Nothing new about this,"I was dissapointed that many of the practices and strategies Barna says in this book is almost identical with strategies of the church I know. Regrettably, he fails to mention about the church.There is nothing new or surprise about the standard of disciple Barna says in the book as it is same standard required to the church where I belong to.Barna did not mention anything about this nor listed in bibliography. I am sure he has researched the church before he wrote this book and I would like to know the reason he did not mention it."
3,Not One of Barna's Best,"I've read several of George Barna's books, and have great respect for him as an author. He brings integrity and fresh insight into all he writes. Having made those statements, Barna has had much better showings than he makes in this volume.Barna shines when he gathers statistical data regarding the church in America and presents it in eye-opening fashion. In this work, he tells us what we already know -- the church needs to do a better job at making disciples. He does offer some helpful insights regarding Christian nurture and development, insights that are described better in other titles.I give this book a ""three"" because it is Barna. If you're a Barna fan, read it and you won't be disappointed. If you are wanting a volume that is truly more ""how to"" rather than ""this is the way things are"", your money would be better invested elsewhere."
4,Survey of Christian Beliefs vs Practice worth the price,"Barna didn't invent the idea of growing disciples. Instead, Barna's surveys and statistics, amply provided and discussed in Growing True Disciples, provide the EVIDENCE and CLOUT needed to move leaders in any church off their programming butts and toward a more vital disciple-building ministry.In many ways, Barna's books are like the TV show ""Mythbusters."" The myth is that ""the program church"" was getting the job done."
3,Decent but doesn't deliver,"While I very much valued the objective data presented in this book, I really felt disappointed at the depth of content. It took me a mere hour and a half to read and honestly felt that much of that were simply flowered sentences that left you wanting for content.It was helpful to be pointed toward congregations that seem to be doing a good job of ""growing true disciples,"" but for me there seemed to be a competing thought in this work. On one hand, you've got Barna talking aobut the organic dynamics present in the early church, but then goes on to recommend profiles and documentation to attempt to measure spiritual growth.So, definitely some value here as a reference, but not as a book for strong practical content, in my opinion."
5,Wonderful lamps!,"These Adesso lamps are truly beautiful. If you need smaller lamps (mine are on top of the two etageres around the entertainment center), these are perfect. Love the touch dimmers, too."
2,"Great Look, but Useless","This lamp looks great, but it only turns on by touch. I hooked it up to the wall outlet, and the switch cannot turn it on and off. It only works by touch."
2,Not very durable,The lights stopped working on two of the three I bought after about four months. Not worth it.
4,For serious readers,"After I heard the author speak on NPR, I couldn't find this book at my local library, so I finally ordered it. I'm glad I did, and will pass it on to other serious Christian friends. It is based on a series of sermons or lessons by an Episcopal clergywoman. She comments on the Psalms, both joyful and lamenting, emphasizing the tradition prayer and of of turning to God in all seasons, Ecclesiastes, Proverbs and Job. She affrms the earth and connection to it as live-giving. As an environmental advocate, I agree with her point of view; but she does present what are inconvenient truths for some."
4,"Good, but a little too broad","I bought this book for a bible study class in 2009 and found it to be interesting and easy to follow... a little too easy as a matter of fact. I would have liked it if Prof. Davis had gotten a little more in-depth on some of the topics. I realize she was probably writing this book for a wide audience, but I wish she had had more of a mind towards an intellectual crowd as I often found the essays ending just as she was getting to the most interesting points. Maybe I'll have to track down some of her other work for that."
3,Not impressed.,"I bought this based on the reviews I read. I installed this on my new BMW 535i. I wanted a clean black license frame. The unfortunate thing about this frame is that it sits on top of the license plate. I prefer one that wraps around the edge and sits a bit more flush with the license frame. Also, the thickness of this frame is pushing on my rear view camera. I really had to force it on there. Wal-Mart sells a frame almost exactly like this, but for $10 on their web-site. I am detailed and picky, so I don't think all black license plate frames are the same."
3,They had his back,"Competently told but the prose is plodding; the narrative moves like a donkey cart on an autobahn.Book documents- How popular Nazi ideology was- How prevalent the system was (not too surprising, considering fascism is considered totalitarian)- How the KZs were well documented in the media- How the ""We didn't know"" excuse common among postwar German citizenry doesn't hold upIn particular, Chapter 9, concerning concentration camps in public spaces is eye-openingThere is a small but very good collection of photographs"
2,Backing Hitler,"I thought that the material was just rehashed and toned downmaterial based on Ian Kershaw.s two books on Hitler. The author leaped about too much for my taste.Then again, I have read over two hundred books on the subject of Nazis, so I am a bit jaded, besides having formedcertain ideas as to the slant of WW II. I did not care for the book because of the reality checks of actual events. Many writers reveal their lack of actualexperience in the conduct of wars, the economic stresses, public acceptance and support. It is easy to be glib, if you are the one that isa non-participant. This adds to the lack of credibility of the author for me. It is only my opinion, and everyone has one. Judge it for yourself,do not rely only on my opinion. As for war, I bruise easily when thrown out of a perfectly good aircraft. I tend tobe delicate, as I bleed profusly when shot. So, I try to avoid these things."
2,Interesting Mess,"I looked forward to reading this volume with great anticipation. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. While the subject matter is certainly interesting, the editing (or lack thereof) is so unacceptable as to make several lengthy passages almost completely unintelligible. For my money, ""Hitler's Willing Executioners"", which covers the same topic, is much more well-constructed, if a bit dry at times."
1,The Kindle version is difficult,"This is not a review of the text, which seems well-documented and timely. My poor review reflects my disappointment with the lack of formatting for a text costing this much. The photos had to be manually searched for; the notes have no links, making for a difficult read."
5,A concise book on the subject.,"I agree with some of the other reviewers of this book, it out does the other books that talk about willing Germans, like Goldhagen's book. It seems to be more complete on the subject and comes to a very nice and well thought out conclusion. This book should be a must read in your collection on this era of history. If not that, it should be the first on your list for books that show how a lot of the Germans then supported the dramatic views of Hitler. Best book I have read on the subject yet."
2,Major Disappointment,"I have several of Omara Portuondo's CDs and love her voice and compositions. I must have misunderstood when it said: Omara and Ibrahim together. I thought these were duets and there were no tracks to listen to the music before buying. My major complaint after that (non-duet) realization is that the ""band music"" dominates and the voices are secondary. A few songs are OK, e.g., Piensa en mi. If you are more interested in the instrumentation than the actual voices then you may like this CD. I purchased the CD to hear Omara (with her wonderful voice) and Ibrahim sing. Back to my old CDs."
1,The Sound is Horrible,"I have purchased many live albums over the years but this has to be the worst recording I've ever heard. Main focus on the Buddy Guy/Junior Wells CD. Well the recordings sound as if they are in a big pipe. The guitars sound tinny, the vocals can hardly be heard. This is the cheapest stuff I've ever heard. There are lots of Buddy Guy/Junior Wells recordings out there don't buy this one. In this day and age of digital recording and upgrades for old analog stuff the sound off of this thing is inexcusable."
3,Very nice product for the price indeed!,Very nice product for the price indeed! They are exactly as described and hold up rather well for what they are.
2,Not the quality,"I ordered these without knowing the quality of them. I have been using Verbatim Slim DVD cases for years. I found the quality of these are not the same as the Verbatim. I have always bought the Verbatim at Sam's Club, but they quit carrying them. These are just not as heavy material as the Verbatims."
4,good but,good product but buy the double 7mm in stead - especially if you have 2 part movies or tv servies you are recording. they take up 1/2 the space
1,Cheap quality and bad smell,These were very poor quality. I ended buying more expensive cases and selling these at a yard sale for less than half what I paid. There is a annoying smell that accompanied them as well that did not dissipate after they had time to be unpackaged and air out.
2,Low Quality,These are very low quality cases. The plastic is very thin compared to the Memorex cases. The clear plastic on the outside is also very thin. Worth 2 stars because most of them work. If you are looking for a professional appearance on your DVD's I would not recommend these cases. You pay for what you get.
1,well at least they are cheap,"UPDATE: DVD doesn't fit in box, product is officially shit.yes, SLIM is the key word. These things are supper skinny, and there walls are paper thin. I will not be getting these again, in fact I am a little bit embarrassed to hand these to my clients. However I have 100 of these to use and no time to send them back.BOTTOM LINE: VERY CHEAP, 100 CASES, SUPPER THIN, LOW QUALITY.It depends what your expectations are; it might not bother some people."
5,Great buy!,"I just received my first order for these slim DVD cases and I'm very pleased with them. I bought similar cases from Sam's Club in the past but they do not carry them anymore. Anyway these cases are even better than the ones from Sam's Club. They close easier and the middle tabs are so much better. I have over 3,000 DVDs in my collection so I know about DVD cases and these are worth the money. I've switched from the regular DVD cases to these slim ones so I can put more DVDs on my shelves. I will order another couple of hundred of them soon."
1,Very low quaility,These case are so thin that when you try to open them they start come apart in the seem. I would never recommend these to anyone. You want to be able to open your cases to be able to watch your movies but don't want them to fall apart.
1,JUNK!,I have been in the audio/video business for 14 years and these are the cheapest and worst product I have ever used. This is also the first bad review I have ever given to a product.Total JUNK! They rip apart when you try to place the insert under the clear plastic. I would not expect them to last more than a few openings...Will not buy these again...get something better....you will regret these...I do!
2,Vact 7mm Slim DVD Cases 100-pack,"these look and function just like verbatium dvd cases, but there the comparison ends, unfortunately these cases are made with a much thinner and more brittle plastic. they will split at the folds on the first opening and will break apart where they snap together again at the first use. i dare say they won't live up to a lifetime of wear. so far i have had 3 break even before they came near a dvd and had to be thrown away."
2,will get the job done,"This product will do the job, holding DVD's of our school's musicals, but it was flimsy and less well made then I was expecting."
2,Not so good,"I ordered these one time before and they weren't too bad, but a few of them did break easy and I wasn't too worried about it. So, when I ran out I ordered some more. Mistake. Almost every case is breaking on me when opening. Save your money and buy a much better quality case; especially if you are like me and giving them to a client. So, now I have almost 100 of these and need so find something to do with them because I am not using."
3,Not as good as I was hoping,"I did read the other reviews before buying these and thought, ""I've bought similar cases, they'll probably be fine."" Unfortunately, not quite. Most of them are fine, but I have only been through a little over half so far and I've had probably 5 of them crack on me (near the fold in the case) while I was trying to be careful not to crack them. I also feel like I have to be careful when I open them all the way to put the cover inserts in, although I haven't had any problems with that so far, they just seem fragile. I haven't had any problems with the plastic sleeves or the hubs.Other than some cracking, they seem to work fine and keep the DVDs protected, I just don't know how long they will last if they are opened frequently. The other brands of slim cases I have gotten in the past have been better quality."
4,Very good replacement,"The last time I ordered these cases the box had a Linkyo logo. I don't know who makes these, the box only states ""100 PCS, (12.8)LBS, Made In China"" The quality is very good, but not quite as good as the previous order. The plastic is thinner and so is the see through cover on the outside. I am very satisfied, however and recommend this product as a replacement. It would also be nice if the product were Made in the USA."
4,Super Thin,"They are thin.. that's for sure.. I wanted to shrink the size of my collection, and with these being about 1/2 the size of a normal case.. I can fit twice as much.. right? They are thin.. and I found if you try to open the case from the center, you can easily tear the plastic. If you take a little extra time and finese opening the cases from the edges, I can see them lasting a long time."
4,Decent enough,"I have used this product for years from multiple suppliers. They are constructed pretty cheap, but are good enough for what I need. You always seem to get a few broken ones in the box (especially if UPS decides to throw them), but for the price it's worth it."
1,great price -- poor quality,"we are unhappy with this purchase. it was the first and will be the last time purchasing the ""7mm"" trim cases. these cases tear ""at the closure tab"" when opening and do not hold the cd or dvd in place when opening as well."
3,ok,"some were broken and some the plastic outside cover (where you put the information, on what is on the disk) was to tight or not cut on the edge"
3,"right price, ok product","My order arrived in a timely manner, outside shipping box in perfect condition. However, inside I found eight broken cases unable to be used. The price was very good so I guess eight out of one hundred wasn't too bad."
1,Bad Product,"These cases hold the DVD's firmly in place, but it is difficult to open them without breaking the case at the inside liner prongs. It doesn't make a difference if it has opened once without a problem, it probably will on second opening. I've used about ten of them and have broken two.The only way to open them safely is to gently flex them at the slot and them insert a fingernail on each end and slide toward the corner. Problem is, are you going to remember to do this the next time?"
2,Very Low Quality,"Very low quality product. Some of the case cracked the moment they arrived. Some edges are not very cleaned cut. The only nice thing about it is price - it's cheap. But no matter how cheap it is, cracked cases is not acceptable."
2,Not what I was expecting,"The quantity for the price here is fantastic and the cases are great if visual presentation isn't super important. For me the quality of the cases was far less than I expected, although functional. Once I put a full color insert into the flimsy see through sheath, the product looks much nicer. Next time I'll pay more."
5,Great,"Great products for Eucerin. I was surprised how quickly the dry, rough skin soften up after using it only a week."
4,Best I've used.,"I have horrible problems with cracked feet in the summer. Even though this creme is a lot thinner than others, it has given me better results than any other I've tried. If you use it every day for even a week you will definitely see great results!"
5,The Best for Diabetic Feet!,"After my Diabetes Therapist gave me a tiny sample tube of this, I searched most of the stores in my area. In frustration, I turned to Amazon and found I could order a 3-pack at a better price than any of the stores, and no waiting for them to get a supply in."
3,"Works good, but dosen't deserve a cult following!","This is moisturizer cream. It is good, don't get me wrong, but I can't see why people would give it the same review as the Fountain of Youth."
5,"Soft, touchable feet","When I started using this product my feet were very dry and cracked. Once I put the cream on my feet the cracked skin immediately looked healed and it was no longer dry, but moist and soft to the touch. I love this foot cream and the price is great."
4,Working thus far,"Only a month into using this product and I feel a slight difference. I've only used half a tube. Wonderful thus far. So far, the best foot cream I've used. To get rid of the roughness and cracked appearance."
3,Not For Everyone,"I have found certain points of this book extremely helpful, but mostly, I have found that it has created doubts in myself and my relationship that were not there prior to reading this book, nor are they even founded-doubts. I have gotten way over being a swinging single, but Stark makes it seems like I should throw my single life a wake and kiss it goodbye because married life is so tedious compared to the days of living alone, having your own money, partying with your college friends, etc etc... I mean who in the world would ever want to spend time with other couples playing board games?I found that this book was very good for a very small percentage of the female population, but anyone who is prepared to be married, happy to be getting married, or been in a relationship for more than a week before they got engaged will find more shallowness in this book than helpfulness."
3,"Very Funny book, but didn't agree with all advice!","I haven't quite read all of this book yet, but what I have read so far is that this author is funny and it is a good read for any bride to be! It will still be something to read after you are married too. I did not like the author assuming that all women have sex before marriage--I am a virgin and plan to be until my wedding day. That was so ridiculous! So, her advice on sex was a little off to me. Anyway, the rest of the book had some good things on switching from being single to married and how to keep up with friends, etc. I will read those parts again to know where to go. Also, I didn't exactly like her part about starting a family. I am Christian/Catholic and we just believe God is part of the say on starting a family. Sometimes your will isn't his and vice versa. I don't believe in any ""birth control"" and I think the author was on verge of saying this is OK--it is not according to my belief system and I was offended.All for now."
2,Didn't finish it,"As a 26 year old bride to be I did not relate to anything in this book. I didn't even finish it. She gave great advice with reminding her readers to say ""I love you"" everyday to thier spouse- but besides that I didn't really know what she was talking about. I could see the emotions surfacing in individuals who were maybe a little older- not to offend- but thoes that had been on their own for a long time before getting married. I was dissapointed."
4,Essential for the new wife or bride-to-be.,"I only wish I had found this book sooner. I am recently married and was struggling with some of the emotions I was feeling as a new ""wife."" In her book Marg Stark shows that the emotions one feels from engaged to married are perfectly normal. On every page I read something that made me exclaim ""That's it! That is what I couldn't put into words."" or ""That is exactly how I feel."" or ""Me too!"" I began to find comfort in what she testified on her behalf and on behalf of all the other brides she interviewed."
1,"Perfect....if you're needy, self-absorbed, vain and bound for divorce court!","I hated this book. No, hate is too nice of a word. I ABHORRED this book. The author and the women that she features in this book are absolutely clueless. They don't understand the first thing about relationships, let alone marriage. The title and cover art make it seem like this is a light-hearted, fun book. That's simply not the case. Rather, this book is meant to be taken seriously and yet the advice is not at all helpful, let alone insightful. PASS on this book- it's not worth your time or money!"
4,So Far So Good,"I am about half way into the book and for the most part I am really finding it enjoyable and comforting. However, being a bride that has been living with her future husband for several years I find that some of the concepts do not pertain to me. Otherwise, highly reccommend the book for brides-to-be. It helps you realize you aren't the only one feeling this way!"
3,What did I miss ??,"I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't think it was funny or shared funny stories and couldn't relate to any of it at all. I can't even remember the highlights of the book and I just finished it last night ! I thought the advice was sketchy and incomplete, there are dozens upon dozens of references to other books that made me feel as if I should be reading those books instead of this one. I thought I would feel enlightened after this book but it didn't offer that at all. It has a few interesting points but only dabbles on them before shifting to a new topic that seems off the track. I felt the author was stretching in some of her stories - she had a story and would mold her story into some sort of advice that didn't seem to really fit. It was difficult to get through, I found myself skipping entire pages just to get to the point.I'm getting married in a month and don't feel as if this book offered me any insight to what is on the horizon for me."
2,This book brought up some interesting issues,"While I appreciated that this was one of the few books on its subject, I was not wholly satisfied with this book. I feel that the author covered each issue very briefly and there was a general lack of depth in her research on other brides, who were all friends of her social circle. The way she gushes on about her husband seems excessive. It reads like a Cosmopolitan magazine article. Also, there were errors or typos in the book that made it seem sloppy. Yellowstone National Park is NOT in the Bay Area!!"
4,A God-Send,"I am a thirty something bride, and felt like I was the only one who was feeling what I was feeling - I love my boyfriend, but have been single for so long. When we got engaged I was not ready for the on-slaught of questions about the planning (which is not fun) and decisions that people expected me to make instantaneously!!! ( what color are your bridesmaids dresses, what kind of flowers, what song are you going to dance to) which happened the day after we got engaged, I felt so much pressure to book a church and reception site THAT DAY - I was ready to scream. I read the book and laughed out LOUD many, many times, because she wrote stories about how I was feeling, and I thought I was the only one who felt that way. Marge let me know that I am somewhat normal and I will get through this. Buy it!"
1,Cynical and Not Very Helpful,"This is mostly a collection of cynical stories. I was excited to read the info on in-laws; however, the only writings on the subject are two stories with no real outcomes nor advice. The only helpful piece of information I received from the book was it's normal to have cold feet...and apparently an affair as well? Very cynical and will not be recommending it to any of my married friends! As a 25 year-old marrying in 5 months I regret reading it."
5,Faith promoting,"I love how this woman writes. She manages to express things I have felt and gives me hope for the future. Her writing is clear, easy to read, full of emotion and yet not sappy. This is the book that hooked me on her writing. You come to love the characters and feel they are part of your family."
5,All Right Anita!!,"I love Anita Stansfield. She is a terrific writer with real talent. My sisters and I have fought over the book to read it, and we have had it since it came out. But we ARE looking for a sequel to By Love and Grace, Anita. Keep up the good work!"
5,A Reference Dictionary for Anyone Who Loves Microscopes,"I became fond of microscopes when I was a child and played with the microscope that my Dad used in medical school. In my first job, I worked for a company that sold laboratory equipment including three brands of American- and German/ Swiss- made microscopes. To my good fortune, I joined an American dealer that sold optical instruments manufactured in Germany and Switzerland. My interest in microscopes continues today, and the Dictionary of Microscopy available from Amazon keeps me informed of optical instrumentation I missed before retirement. All the terms used in the disciplines where microscopes are used are in the Dictionary."
5,wow,"i got this pendant and he is just beautiful. i named him thorn after the dragon in christopher paolinis book, Eldest. i never leave the house without him. he is good luck and a beautiful piece of jewelery."
2,The color is not as it should be!,I am very disappointed with this costume. It is a drab sea foam green instead of a vibrant kelly green. I didn't expect much durability based on the price but it is poorly made and just overall not satisfactory. My son still wants it but I think I will find something better and donate this one since returns are a pain.
2,terrible quality,"This costume is poor quality even when compared to the typical cheaply made costume. Contrary to the picture, the costume does not have the faux boots, it has green material on the legs ending at the ankles and that's it. The patch on the center is sewn on by a few stitches in the center and so it flops around everywhere. The stitching that holds the color on is loose and black, so that the stitches show very visibly all around the collar. The neck - where the only closure is - is impossibly tiny and doesn't fit around my 2 year old's neck, let alone the 5 year old for whom the costume is intended, yet the back directly under the collar closure gapes open so that a huge v shape isn't covered."
1,Poor Quality,"We ordered this costume for our 4 year old and were very disappointed. The fabric was flimsy, the insignia on the front was affixed sideways, and the velcro in the back did not even line up to close properly. The merchant provided a refund; however, we are still searching for decent boy's dress up clothes..."
3,"What happened to good grammar, punctuation, spelling, etc.?","The kindle edition had so many errors in spelling, punctuation, grammar, etc. that sometimes the meaning of the sentences was unclear. Surely this can be avoided with some editing. I was very disappointed with so many errors. I did enjoy the storyline, however."
4,"Smooth, Classic and Distinct","The lead vocals are unique. Though the music is modern, the vocals take me back to better times with a vintage Bob Dylan feel. But it is the acoustic guitar style of this artist that is most appreciated. If you're into classic rock and jazz, you can distinctly hear and feel all the various classical influences come alive throughout each song. Give it a listen, and then listen again. This music is truly smoother than whiskey."
5,Pink Floyd came here,"This is one excellent batch of tunes! Bruce Springsteen is great, Manfred & the Band make him greater with their intense version of ' Spirits In The Night '. No part of the whole ""Nightingales & Bombers"" experiment is flawed. It even makes me feel sorry for the heavy-set,aka... ""Fat Nellie"".Pink Floyd used on ""The Wall"", very well I might add, the same 1940's recording which gives this collection its name. Remember the lirics on the first song on side two of ""The Wall"", ' Look Mommy, there's no plane up in the sky '? Compare the back-ground sounds of that song with the end of the great title cut of ""Nightingales & Bombers"". Might surprise ye."
3,"Interesting Stuff, Doofy Host","This series was worth it overall - a couple of cities had less material than others and got repetitive, but some were really interesting. Budapest was great until they tried to make you feel bad for the Nazi sympathizers.The host tried too hard to be ""cool."" Thought he was in an action movie or something. Seemed to be overcompensating for a deep-seated hatred of his mother."
5,Super Supremes.....,Another fantastic Limited Edition CD release from Hip-O Select. I'm sure fellow Supremes fans will be looking forward to further releases. I hope that there are more unreleased treasures by The Supremes found in the Motown vaults.Great service and great price from Amazon.com Thank you !
4,The Supremes winning streak continues,"My favorite '60's Supremes song is here, My World Is Empty Without You. Also I Hear A Symphony. Besides Symphony the background vocals on 1-6 are very muted. Also somewhat true on My World but I think it makes that song even more sophisicated and haunting. Songs 8-12 have more background vocals. Diana, Mary and Florence give A Lover's Concerto their own style, one of my favorites on here."
3,great presentation and package,This is slightly let down by a creatively inferior original album. But great remastering and packaging and super bonus cd is a great addition to my Supremes collection
2,Truly A Little Book,"Cam Cloud's ""The Little Book of Acid"" doesn't really add much to our understanding of LSD, its effects, or is subculture. More of a resource for acquiring seeds and directions for synthesizing psychedelic substances, this contribution to the growing literature on LSD pretty much just summarizes and charges for information commonly and easily available for free on the Internet.This book and other Ronin publcations do attempt to respond to an important readership, and they do represent a kind of avant garde in that respect, but they really need to improve the quality of their work. Misspelling ""Aldous Huxley"" as ""Aldus"" in a book on LSD indicates weak editorial work and a lack of commitment to the quality of their products. Other sentences in the book simply don't make sense as a result of editorial carelessness. Ronin has an interesting catalogue. I like it, and I like them, but they need to sharpen up their publishing skills!"
3,You have to use sooo much,"Tastes quite good..but 4 tbs per cup is a lot. We use the coco motion machine and generally make 4 cups at a time, so measuring out 16 tbs is a lot."
4,If you like chocolate...this is the one!,It is a powerful chocolate drink and tastes wonderful with whipped cream. I would recommend it and will buy again.
4,Solid Mann,"The 1980 release ""chance"" finds Mann with a new set of musicians backing him in the studio. Chris Thompson only sings on three of the tracks, but alas, this is Mann, he pulls it off with aplomb. Nine quality tracks are offered with standouts being 'Lies (through the 80's)', 'For You' (a Springsteen tune), and 'Stranded'. Thats just my opinion for the moment because I really like ""Hello, I am your heart' and 'No guarantee'. As usual Mann's keyboards are phenomenal as is the production. Manfred's ability as an arranger as well as keyboardist shines again on this release. Another in a string of high quality Earth Band efforts."
4,Read my adventure summaries,Great adventure pack. Pathfinder game system rocks. I wrote write-ups to every session we played in this adventure:[...]Check them out!!!
2,Diana Waring Audio Set,"Her history manuals are excellent and we are planning to use them a 2nd time as we are studying history from Creation to the present. We did not like the audio portions, however. The recordings are classroom teacher-like. Her voice is not interesting to listen and is even annoying to the ears. I think the content is excellent but my children did not enjoy listening to her presentation."
3,Okay but there are better ones.,"They work good and as they should. My comments are:- Not too sticky, may fall off if close to heat/windows/doors with direct sunlight.- Not too loud. Other doberman alarm system I bought from the local store is twice as loud and almost same price.- On/Off options only. No chime.- Need alot of small betteries.Overall okay but would recommend the other Doberman product not available on amazon at the time of this review."
3,Good but doesn't work on every door,Bought this for my front door now that my son has learned to open the door and escape but after getting it I realized it's quite loud! I was hoping this would be quiet enough to use on my front door to let me know if my kids opened the door and not make them cry and then I thought I'd use it on a basement door that is rarely used but the 2 pieces of the alarm have to be put together in such a way that if your door frame isn't just so then it won't work. Perhaps I can get it to use on a window but none of my doors will allow this to be used on them.
2,False alarms on cold nights?,"When I saw this I thought it might be good to place on my sliding glass door for when we are out. So I installed it and set it overnight the first night. I was wakened at 1am by the blaring alarm, too groggy to realize if there was an intruder or not. I dashed to the door, a sitting duck if there had actually been an intruder. Gladly, not. I reset it and was awakened again at 3am by another false alarm! I can only imagine the 45 degree temperature had something to do with it. It has a little magnet fob that goes next to it, and when the alarm is separated from the fob, the alarm turns on. But two false alarms in one night? I don't care to try it another night.I can't leave a device like this in my home unattended, it could false alarm while I'm away, and actually announce to the neighbors that I'm NOT at home. Into the junk pile, or to the returns desk."
1,not great,Not a bad product. You can get the same frequency window break/open alarm at most Dollar Tree stores for 1.00. to me it's not worth the money.
2,Very disappointed,This has to be worst book I have ever read of Elizabeth Lowells. Usually all her books are keepers and I love reading them again but this one I have sold off. I am in total agreement with other reviewers who found this just not realistic and bad dialog.
1,Cruel Man,"Only a mistreated, emotionally abused woman like Tory would fall in lust with a cruel abusive man like Ethan. All the man did was treat her like dirt, laugh at her, and then have sex with her. She would have been a lot better off walking into town and out of his life forever.Lowell writes good time wasting books. I am glad I read a lot of them before this one. There is no excuse for it."
3,Something's Missing,"Elizabeth Lowell has written some wonderful romance novels, but this isn't one of them. Oh, she's got the love scenes, the cruel hero, the spunky heroine, but not much story. It's like she only wrote part of a book. She forgot to tell the reader why Tory would fall in love with such a meanie - lust doesn't always equal love."
4,Great Examples,"Wonderful book with great photos and examples, some from different angles which are very useful to understand the actual lay out of these great Japanese gardens. Could use more in dept explanation of technical characteristics, but non the less wonderful."
5,Landscapes for Small Spaces: Japanese Courtyard Gardens,"This is an excellent resource for persons with some previous familiarity with Japanese landscape design or are in the landscape design field. It is not a ""how to"" book, rather, it is full of beautiful photographs of actual Japanese courtyard landscapes done in an ancient, classic landscape style. It's a glimpse into gardens in Japan most people will never have an opportunity to visit. In fact, many are in private homes not open to visitors as well as being in small hotels and monasteries. It is a fascinating glimpse into those Japanese homes and shows how they integrate interior spaces to courtyard gardens. It is a good resource for architects looking for ways to integrate spaces for reflection in public or private buildings."
5,faulty product,The book is excellent but the dust cover was torn obviously before despatch as the packaging was good.The disappointment was that there was no method of complaint other than returning the product. From Australia to USA not practible.
1,So Far It Sucks!,"I have had this program for 3 months now and have not won anything with this software. Not even close. The program is pretty cool and the update feature is great, but what good is all of that if the program doesn't really work. At least not for me. I know that some people say that it worked well for them, but I find that hard to believe."
2,Dissappointed,"The software works OK, but haven't gotten any more than three numbers on a draw six lottery after 8 months of trying. The biggest thing to watch out for is support, or lack of. If you rebuild your computer or buy a new one and have to re-install their software, you have to get another product ID from them. It took me almost two weeks of begging and a phone call (just an answering machine on their end) to get a response from them. I am coming up on a week of trying to get a response from them for a product ID for my new computer. Funny, because they responded the next day when I first baught the program and they had my money in hand!"
3,A great story that lost something in this telling..,"The writing is clear and manages to convey many of the important details of Wallenberg's life, yet it was written for a typical young-adult audience. To a sopisticated reader this text can come across as a bit hollow and wooden. These amazing human beings and the incredible times they lived in appear somewhat simplified and one-dimensional in this book. It was lacking a bit too much in feeling and deeper exploration of human nature for this adult reader. Still Wallenberg's life is a great story and worthy of being told many times over. It's just that this one alone fails to do it complete justice."
1,Laying snares for patent trolls,"The editors of this book chose to deliberately include an article on patented material written by the trolls who own the patent. The readers of this series are not looking for information that they cannot use. The worst part is that it is not clearly called out what ideas are patented, so someone skimming the article could miss the one line mention of the patent pending in the conclusion and wind up in a legal fiasco. I will not buy a later book in this series."
1,Save your money,"This item is cheaply made and I sent it back. The picture looks cool but it's deceiving. The minute hand was so loose that when it was on the right side, it flopped down to the right and then when it was on the left, it plopped down to the left. It couldn't keep the right time!"
1,Zelco Wall Clock,"This clock is TERRIBLE. It not only didnt work (the hands constantly hit eachother forcing me to bend the hands so they could go past) but also if you want to move the dots it will take a chunk of your wall off. Also, the clock is cheap and plastic. Do not buy."
3,Zelco Real Wall Clock,"This is the second clock I had to order. I love this clock but it is not reliable. The second clock didn't work out of the box and I had to fiddle with it to make it work. The problem is that if the clock part dies on you, you have to buy a new one unless you want to pull off the clock dots off the wall and repaint."
1,Cost me time and effort,"The first thing I should have done was to insert a battery to see if the clock worked. I learned this lesson after I took the time to use the template to put the time-dots on the wall and the clock hanger. Then I found the clock didn't work. I changed the battery which didn't help. Getting the dots and hanger off the wall wasn't easy, then there was the trip to the post office to return it."
2,nice but crummy,"After running perfectly for several years, this clock began to destroy itself: the hands loosened and hit one another so that until rescued, they gave pathetic convulsive movements as one hand tried to pass the other. Sometimes the clock flung itself off the wall, further bending the hands. It ran perfectly for several years before it broke, though. Since $25 seems too much for a replacement, I guess I'll throw the whole thing away -- but what to do with the hour markers glued tight to the mirror?"
1,"Arrived with bent hands, and then stopped working","This product arrived with its hands bent so they couldn't turn freely. After very carefully straightening them and inserting a battery, the clock ran for about 12 hours and then it stopped -- forever. I had to return it. I had previously owned one of these same models for about 10 years. That one ran well until the day it died..."
1,Zelco Real Wall Clock,"Clock is smaller than I thought, and is only intended to take up about a square foot of wall. Made of cheap materials, definitely not worth $25."
4,"Oldy, but a goody","It is an older book, but I still really enjoyed it. I had read it when I was a teenager, so it brought back good memories for me."
5,sweet cherry,"Good single/ep! It starts off with AWFUL (great song) then a REALLY good live version of ""pretty on the inside"", lots of shrieking and its played really hard, its great, which immediatly kicks into ""Heaven Tonight"", cute version, then ""Northern Star"", which is gorgeous, when courtney sings during the bridge (it made me cry when i first heard the lyrics she sang) then ""Awful"" live, which is REALLY good, i love how she screams some of the lyrics ""I WAS PUNK! NOW I'M JUST STUPID I'M SO AWWWWWFULLLLLLLLL!"". Then a dancemix of Malibu. Which is, pretty good I guess. I mean, it would have been better if they just put another live track on, but its still pretty cool, if you like dance music. The tour booklet has REALLY great photos too! great EP"
3,It's okay,"The bag is pretty thin and the whole thing doesn't feel very durable. If this is for light home use then I would say this is a good, bet; however, if you are going to be filling this to the brim and tossing it around a lot I would say you should look for something a little studier. I know from doing laundry at my company through Purple Tie that the Roughneck Heavyweight bags are pretty sturdy, but I don't think you can buy them online yet. I would also say that the bag is a little overpriced."
4,lyrical prose,"This gem-like story of a mysterious woman who comes to live with a Jewish family is written in lyrical, crystalline prose. We are treated to exquisitely drawn characters. The place and times are richly delineated and are replete with historical detail. The denouement is not fully realized, yet the pleasure I found reading this novel was real, and the flaw in plot development does not extinguish the lingering questions of spirituality raised.In some ways it is unfortunate that ""Everything is Illuminated"" was published about the same time as Stollman's work of similar title. The two works are profoundly dissimiliar- and I fear that Foer's hysterically funny book overshadows this elegant piece. Ironically, I found both efforts benfit from being read back to back, as different lenses on Jewish/immigrant life experience."
4,rodman,This book was delivered in timely manner.Answered a lot of my questions on material and usage.number and seperation on rod guides.A lot of info in a small book.
3,Ho-hum,"The book has basic information...very basic. Nice beginner book, but definitely no frills. Needs some basics on decorative wraps and working with multiple piece rods."
5,Rod Building,This book was awsome. I read a few times and it takes you step by step on how to build a fishing rod. I have built 3 fly rodsand 3 spinning rods with this book. My kids have also built rods with this book as well. Great book for begginers who want to start building fishing rods but dont have the time or money to pay for the class.
5,Best I've read,I have several rod building books. Bought this one for my personal library on the subject. I think it is the best rod building book I have read so far. The color photos are great and really very helpful. I really don't see how they can sell it for less then... Great book.
4,Best Fifa game so far,"After the latest versions of fifa i was getting really dissapointed at the franchise, but after Fifa08 im getting my hopes up again. A lot of different game modes, the be a pro mode being the most revolutionary addiotion, and its also a lot of fun to play.The menus, music and overall presentation has improved greatly, as well as the AI, except for some details where the NPC's do really weird and incohernt stuff, but it doesnt bother me as much as it did in previous Fifa games.Its a fun game overall, and if you like futbol, you should get it!"
2,The epitome of frustration,"I wanted SO MUCH to like this game. It started well enough,..smooth graphics, tons of teams and leagues, life-like player renderings. The gameplay seemed to be pretty good too. A week later, i'm still on the amateur level and still can't score goals. I have owned every FIFA game for the past 10 years and have always played at the highest levels to great success. I have played soccer/coached soccer for over 30 years. This game is so irritating that I have not only broken 2 controllers, it is going back asap. The FIFA franchise' gameplay has gone BACKWARDS since it peaked in 2005. The game does not reward solid buildup or creativity. Most goals are of the garbage variety. Its next to impossible to take the ball from the CPU yet they are TOO smart to pry open with through balls and too sound in the middle of the backline to beat on the dribble. The game is simply too complicated. Bring back the simplicity of the 2005 version with updates and rosters."
3,Spaguetti,"The game has all the teams, players, places, tactics, movements...and at the end, when you are playing, you will find that all that plus will make your game difficult to develop.You dont use all the tactics stuff and in my experience I dont see a true difference when I play the different formations that you can select.What I have sometimes is a crazy goalkeeper going to the middle of the groung without control..."
3,Never feel as though you have full control.,"I was really looking forward to FIFA for the PS3, however, I have to say that I am extremely disappointed. You wont enjoy passing the ball to your player and watching him stand there waiting for the ball to arrive to him and your opponant just coming along and intersecpting the ball. Especially on long passes where your player is on the enivitable track. If you can get past these issues you will enjoy the game, but it will continue to fustrate you in competitive games."
3,Very Frustrating,i bought a PS3 because i thought FIFA 08 was going to be the FIFA game I had been waiting for all these years (I have bought everyone since 97). How wrong was I? Although the pro view is great in theory it is very unpractical. especially when you cross the ball. You have to hope for the best to get on the end of the ball as the camera panning is slower than molasses.I also agree with everyone else's negative reviews. A very annoying game.
3,Needs HDTV,"I have only one thing to say.If you don't have a HDTV, do not buy this.The letters on the screen are too small and blurred, you can hardly read it."
5,great addition to the fifa series.,"i can not express in words how great this game is. i played soccer competitely for over a decade and have been coaching a competitve premier club team for over 4 now. the game designers did a magnificent job constructing the way the game is supposed to be played. this game might seem hard and or not as fun as the last fifa games for somebody who doesn't understand the actual game of soccer. the AI in the game is amazing and will actually adapt to how you play the game and start using your own tactical style of play against you. this is actually the first fifa that has ever given me a challenge and i love it. the game is very smooth and the way the players touch the ball can only be better represented by watch an actual live game. an amazing game. if you are a fan of soccer, this is a must by."
1,Worst control ever!,"First, I've been playing EA Fifa since 2000. Second, those games were ALWAYS my favorites, even compared with other soccer games. But I have to admit this one has a real big problem with controls: it supposed you enjoy scoring, so why you are always shooting to the posts???? Why is so difficult to move the ball and left the defenders away? I want a game to relax and enjoy, not a dissapointing game when the score is always against your team, because a single shot from the computer is a goal...but you have to score 1 in 20 shots!!!! And I'm talking with 9 years playing the same game, even the 08 for PS2."
3,"Not Your Typical Guide, really a three and a half","I get where they are coming from with this guide it says within the first few pages that this is not a guide to hold your hand,and they dont definatly not.But somtimes it totally leaves you hanging.I mostly purchase a guide by default just to have in case i am stuck, and try and complete game myself but looking through this guide as i play along after i go some were to make sure i dont miss anything and i find its pretty basic. the reason i give it three and a half stars is it does as stated in guide guide in the right direction by placing in order places to go the best way though the game with dungeun and town maps. and it tells you whats in each town to buy and what items are in the town or dungeon but it doest all ways say were eah item is specificaly as what chest or what barrle conyains what item. the fold out maps incuded are helpful when trying to find paths."
2,About As Useful As No Guide At All,"This guide gives you no incentive to purchase it rather than just go to gamefaqs.com and get your info there. The only useful pieces of info are the character progressions guides, sidequests, and alchemy guide. This info is easily obtained online in concise, printable form. Don't bother with purchasing unless you just like the pretty maps."
1,Lot's of pictures and one useful map.,"I haven't bought a stategy guide in years, so maybe it's just come to this, but when I pay for an official game guide I kinda expect everything to be in there. If I didn't want spoilers I wouldn't have bought the guide in the first place.Dragon Quest VIII is a huge game with lot's to do, so I though it would be a great game to have the strategy guide for. Except the stategy guide is severely limited by the fact that it doesn't want to spoil anything for you. It will give you a small map of the first area you are going to need to go and list most of the items that can be found, although it won't tell you where most of them are or how to obtain them.I'm stuck right now most of the way into the game in an area not covered at all by the guide, and I need to go online to find the answer. Not cool.The guide has very few redeeming qualities. The only info it gives you is common sense and the only time you'd need it is for the things it doesn't cover. Waste of money."
2,another brady junk,"just as most of their strategy guides, they use ""no spoilers"" as an excuse to NOT give you a lot of information. If you go by the stragy guide only, you will end up missing a lot of interesting places. There are much better walkthrus online, and free, too.I buy a stragy guide for every RPG I own. The sole reason is to collect the artwork."
3,It's all right,"I like the maps in the book and the alchemy list, but I was hoping for more of a walk-through."
3,Huge guide for huge game but appearences can be deceiving,This guide does have great info and it's huge has lots of maps but it doesn't hold your hand and tell ya how to get from point A to B. Doesn't give away any story but there's alot of missing infomation i was more frustrated because the lack of info. It give's info on some aspects of the game while others just non-existent. This is more of a game atlas then a game guide with some side information i suggest gamefaqs or other online sites be better if you really want to have a guide then i suggest getting the piggyback uk version of the guide be bit more expensive but has full info and walkthrough i got mine at amazon.co.uk i give the piggyback version 5 stars but this guides just falls quite bit short as a game guide.
3,Not really a strategy guide.....,"While this makes a nice companion of sorts, it is in no way a comprehensive strategy guide. Most of the item locations are given as ""unknown..."" and it doesn't even list most of the bosses. I just wish I had known all this before I bought the book, since I could have simply downloaded a decent walkthrough on Gamefaqs and saved myself $18.Now, for some of the positives: it does give nice maps for all areas, and shows where most of the treasure is located on the overland maps, but not in towns. It has a nice section on alchemy, although it admits that there are probably some recipes that aren't covered in the book.As much as I hated the book, my husband loved it, hence the 3 star compromise. If you just want an atlas, by all means you'll love this. I admit to wanting a little more hand-holding from my strategy guides, so I wasn't a fan."
4,Needs better binding,"The content of this book is fantastic, great maps, great item/monster lists, lots of little hints along the way that won't spoil the story line unless you go on ahead. However, it takes very little of flipping through the book for information before the pages comes out of the binding, be ready to catch and replace them!"
1,crap,"This is the worst strategy guide I have ever seen. this tells you nothing about strategy. Does not tell you where to go, what to do, and how to beat bosses. Everyone that says this is a good guide is an idiot. I could take a crap and smear it on a piece of paper and it would tell me more about the game than this crappy guide. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
1,i tried to give it zero,"Wow brady games this is the absolute worst game guide i have have ever seen. The info is at best incomplete and at worst completely missing. The generic review mentions bosses, don't hold your breath. None of the bosses i have fought yet are in the book (im 70 hours into it). Also don't expect anything aproaching a usable walkthrough just go to gamefaqs.com for a REAL walkthrough this stinker sucks. I think this is worst brady games has ever done in terms of a guide. I can get better info on the web why bother with this worthless guide?"
1,Don't BOTHER!!!!!!!!,DON'T BUY IT! DON'T BUY IT! IT DOES NOT HELP AT ALL I know that is should not give a detail blow by blow on hove to beat the boss but at least IT SHOULD TELL YOU A BOSS IS COMMING UP!!!! ( I AM NOT DONE WITH THE GAME YET) BUT SO FAR FOR EVERY DUNGEON THAT THERE WAS A BOSS BATTLE IT WAS NOT LISTED AND I WAS CAUGHT UNPREPARED and it does not help with the story you had to guess on what to do next. take my advice don't buy it! go to gamefags instead its better and you will save money to.
3,Acceptable,The only difficulty I had with this guide was that doesn't exactly pin point the locations of the medals in the towns/castles.
3,a good reference but far from perfect,This is an excellent guide but it is sorely lacking in some areas so much so its useless to anyone going for 100% due to what isn't covered in detail. for your average players its of use but it could have been much much better.
2,Do yourself a favor and buy the piggyback guide.,"Brady.....what can I say. Charging 20 bones for an incomplete piece work. Where do I start, it has no boss strategies and their excuse is that it will spoil the game........I don't know about you, but when I BUY a guide I expect it to do everything but tell me the story of the game. This guide is skimpy on item locations during the walkthru (which is almost non-existant). The only thing this guide does extremely well is the alchemy pot recipes and where to find the items. It also does a good job of pinpointing monsters for your monster teams. Apart from that don't expect it to guide you thru the game. So like I said in the title, if you are looking for a guide for this game, skip this one since free online FAQ's give you more info. Just go to the bookdepository.co.uk and buy the piggyback (the guys who made the good Halo 3 guide) european guide, it covers the same game, has boss strategies, recipes, detailed maps, etc."
5,"Very, Very helpful",I got this book beacuse I couldn't find what to Expect when your Expecting and I love it!! It is very helpful. I then got WTE and found that PTP had better information in most places. This book has more Medical information. I found that the other book said See your doctor or try the diet way to often. I would reccommend this book to anyone. I particularly liked the area that talks about how the baby is growing and what is happining to her/him.
4,Esta bien pero........,"Aunque el contenido es v√°lido, el men√∫ est√° mal hecho. Es dificil navegar en el disco, pero si no son muy exigentes lo recomiendo."
5,Finally a common sense approach to meditation!,"Like another review posted here, I had tried and failed a few times to learn meditation by reading other books. None really took into account that I lead a busy, fast-paced life full of business pressure, flying off here and there, living in hotels and customers yelling for everything to be delivered yesterday. The other books on meditation that I'd read were solid works but they weren't wtitten by someone that had walked the kind of path and led the kind of life I do. This is a common sense straight from the hip great book that worked for me written by a guy that obviously knows his stuff. Terrific job."
1,"Only ONE connector ships, and does not include the cable crimps","I haven't yet had the opportunity to use this product, but the order only includes ONE connector, and does not include the 2 crimps that it says it comes with. I've returned one order to Amazon (great customer service for an essentially robotic process with no human contact) and the second was the same: single connector, no crimps. Beware!"
1,OMG BAD,"I love low budget horror, in which genre this movie clearly falls. However, it also falls on every other relevant category. I don't categorically love low budget horror, I love low budget horror that has something outstanding to deliver, like a good concept, decent acting, creative camera work, etc. None of these elements is present in this film. Honestly, the story is completely incomprehensible throughout; someone just decided to make a movie, then threw a bunch of nonsense together in no particular order and called it a movie. Avoid this movie. There are far many other options that provide something interesting and not waste your time."
3,Decent,"It's probably actually a fairly good deal for the price, but it has some significant flaws. Most importantly, the digital circuit that allows for a lot of its convenient features, which do make it very easy to use, also makes the pitch step instead of varying continuously. The problem with this is that, rather than the instant, continuous feedback you would get from a continuously varying tone, there's a slight delay due to the stepping, which limits its usefulness, IMHO. If there was another similar device in the same price range that didn't have this defect, I would go with that, but, as far as I know, there isn't, so I guess I could give this one a halfhearted recommendation."
5,Up the Mountain,"Hurrah for Charlotte Agell. Another gem of a book. Up the Mountain is a treasure - the simplicity of the story. This author's values are right, both in content and in choice of colors. Charlotte Agell has such a positive outlook: just what I want my kids to be exposed to - no violonce in sight. Young and old will love this rhyming story. I cannot wait to see where this eclectic group of animals go next!"
1,Average health book,"If you would like to be informed of sound nutritional sense then try 'Understanding Nutrition' by Whitney/Rolfes instead. I used the latter in college and was surprised to find that is it not a traditional apples and oranges nutritional guide but contains sensible up to date diet plans, calorie counters, height/weight guides and surprising information on the dangers of vitamin overloads and certain alternative health ""cures"". This book is based on fad/alternative health quick fixes that are best avoided."
2,"This is NOT a book, it's a brochure.","This is a 24 page museum bulletin about the Arms & Armor Collection donated to the Philadelphia Museum Of Art by Carl Otto Kretzschmar von Kienbusch. Published in 1985, it contains 28 black & white photos, 19 of which feature pieces or groupings from the collection.The narrative is primarily about Mr. Kienbusch and how he came to acquire the collection. In that sense it provides a decent background to his pattern of acquisitions and interests in the pieces he purchased.As a reference to the collection itself, seek another source!"
2,Witty But a Little Clueless,"If you are afraid of virtual reality which will take over our world, you may get some food for thought in this novel. Munroe presents a world in 2036 when everyone wants to get transferred to virtual reality Frisco (ex San Francisco sadly destroyed by an earthquake) leaving their bodies behind. Munroe has some interesting ideas but he apparently likes them so much that instead of moving the plot forward dwells on them for far too long. In effect they don't really come together to make a real novel."
1,Horrible....YUCK YUCK YUCK,"This is a horrible book. I have never felt so negatively about a book. NEVER! You can't follow the story, who is who? Who is real and who is in ""Frisco"" and has their body stored. What's up with the freaky make your own pets???? And the air??? The debt collectors vans that snatch you....What happened??? Confusion....ick.....what a waste of a tree....."
5,"Great price, great product!","I have to purchase Island on line because it is not available in stores anymore. I have tried several sites and this is the best price, and the real thing (not so sure about some others!). If you love this perfume, buy it here."
5,"Great product, fast response!","I absolutely love this parfum, it only took three days after ordering for me to receive it, product and response time is awesome!"
3,Cannot rate just yet...,"Cannot rate just yet, but I have to in order for this to post... but I think I just made a major boo-boo. I don't think this will be the same Island Michael Kors that I sampled at ULTA. The one at ULTA is for Island Michael Kors PALM BEACH. This item doesn't say PALM BEACH anywhere. What is this one then? Is it an old, old scent that Michael Kors doesn't even carry anymore?? ACK!"
1,"Love this perfume, but DO NOT PURCHASE FROM AMAZON!","This is one of my favorite perfumes, but do NOT purchase it from Amazon! I bought my original at a regular store and loved it. I ordered my second one from Amazon and it is NOT the same! The packaging looks the same, but the perfume inside is yellow and smells horrible... NOTHING like the original. You cannot return this product, but luckily I called customer service and they are suppposed to be refunding my purchase. I have never had an issue with Amazon orders before, but I will say there customer service is great."
1,Beware of Counterfeit Items,Product did not smell anything like the original. Product was either too old or it was a counterfeit.
2,Too strong,The scent of this product was too strong. I don't recommend it for work because it lingers for a long time and the scent is not so pleasant. Next time I prefer to try some other brand of Perfume Spray.
1,do not buy from amazon!.. but great perfume,"I love this scent, but didn't listen to the reviews of others and bought it from amazon. It was in the original packaging but the perfume itself was discolored (yellow) and smelled NOTHING like it was supposed to. I don't know if it was contaminated somehow or amazon bought a bad batch but it was awful! It didn't just smell like the wrong fragrance, it is unwearable because it smells so strong and cheap. Amazon doesn't accept returns on perfume, but customer service was great and refunded my money."
4,rancho 5000,good shocks...I like the rubber shields better than the hard plastic.Just wondering why I have to put them together? I would buy again!
1,POOR JOB BY COMPANY,Someone made a BIG mistake. I had ordered two shocks and this was shipped by mistake along with one of the correct item.I will say that my money was refunded promptly.
5,great building set,I bought this building set for my grandson for Christmas. He is so hooked already we are thinking of adding some more to it in the near future. It's a different twist for kids that like all kinds of building sets. Great toy!
2,"Gear, Gears, Gears Motorized Monsters","I bought the Motorized Monsters set here (I don't see it listed now) based on fabulous reviews. I was very disappointed in the set and so was my 6 year old son. It is noisy, clunky and not at all the fun toy that we were expecting."
2,Looks pretty but lacks durability,"This was a fun toy to look at and the box it came in was huge compared to what was inside. The colors are fantastic, but actually getting the gears to work is another story all together. The snaps were EASILY breakable and would lodge inside the gears. The directions for making a robot or an airplane were ridiculous and I usually don't have a problem with complicated directions. Skip this one and go for a science kit."
4,Fun for the whole family,I bought this gift for my nephew. It seems to be a great toy. All ages from 6 to 44 sat down and played with this toy. The only thing was the hand cranks came off way to easy. And one of the springs that rotates broke off within 15 minutes. We will look into getting that replaced though. Lots of fun for all ages.
3,Learn from my mistake! The blue/green storage/work table isn't included!,"I hope my mistake helps someone else. I came across this item which shows a picture of the storage table with the gears. FYI - you DON'T get the storage table with this gear set. It's sold separately for $80. The photo with the storage table doesn't sell this specific product and should be removed - or at least mentioned in the disclaimer. It's misleading.Also, the kids really enjoyed playing with these before -we thought perfect Christmas gift! However, contrary to my original thought, you really only need one set, not the standard set plus a motorized set to keep them from getting bored. Your primary set can be one of the motorized sets which already include over 100 gears!"
5,the reinhold book of needlecraft,this is a great all around book for people who want to do different needlework. it is a great to look up things that youhave missed.
3,Underwhelming,"This player looks more impressive on the box than in my hands. It's bigger than I had thought, and feels kind of cheap.The LCD is not backlit, the maximum volume level is pitifully low, the interface is confusing (explain what ""Yes"" and ""No"" buttons mean), and the software that ships with it (the freely-downloadable version of Real Jukebox) is minimal."
2,Broke after a week...,"I was really happy with my Philips Rush MP3 player. It came with a lot of cool accessories (car adapter, belt clip, power adapter) and was small enough to fit in my pocket during trips to the gym. It also came with great software (Real Jukebox 7). However, after a couple days of use, the Previous and Next buttons on the Philips Rush did not want to work all the time. I had to press the buttons very hard to move to the next or previous song. After about a week, my Philips Rush decided it didn't want to turn on at all! I even tried different powersources, but to no avail, it stayed off. I took it back to the store for a full refund and am now on the hunt for a new MP3 player."
1,"No Windows 2000 support,","Do not buy a Philips Rush. The software only supports Windows 98. It does not support Windows 2000 or Mac. Think you'll just use a SmartMedia card reader like SanDisk ImageMate to transfer MP3 files? Think again, the Rush will not play normal ""unsecure"" MP3 files, they have to be encrypted with the RealJukeBox software. The Rush also does not support Windows Media Audio, the firmware is not upgradable, and it is expensive.."
2,A waste of money and TIME!,"i got this player 2 years ago for christmas...i like the size and some of the options that it has...what it sucks about this player is that when you are uploading th songs, your are not uploading MP3...so its gonna take longer...maybe a couple years...also this mp3 player is based in LPT1 connection, so it makes the player one of the slowest players in the world when you are uploading songs....also, you CANT use this MP3 on WINDOWS XP...theres no windows xp driver.....adding to all this, PHILIPS COSTUMER SERVICE SUCKS!! they dont know anything about their products...so, if u wanna buy a very cheap MP3 player DO NOT think about buying this one, even if is $5...."
1,Beauty IS only skin deep...,"Sure it's cool looking, but as soon as you start trying to use this [product], you discover that you'd have been better off with something less glitzy. It doesn't work with Windows 2000 (a MAJOR mistake on Philips' part, seeing as how Win 9x is soon going the way of the dodo), the case is another example of pretty but function-imparied, it uses a miserably slow parallel interface, it plays only MP3s (no WMA support), the format it uses for its SmartMedia cards is proprietary, and it uses Real's misbegotten RealJukebox software.If you're looking for a high-quality, flexible, functional digital music player, do yourself a favour: KEEP LOOKING."
2,Too Bad,"I purchased my Rush SA107 30 days ago. The unit comes with all the accessories that you would need, however, they are to no avail when the main unit doesn't work. This is my second unit. The first one had a bad connection for the audio output. The unit I currently have also has a bad audio output jack but I learned to live with that.The unit keeps shutting off after a minute or two. I just got off the phone with Rush support and it appears this one is defective. I will soon be on my third unit.I bought mine at a discounted price($...) instead of $.... Had I spent the full reatil price I really would be sick.My advice is to keep looking, don't stop with this unit. It is a slick unit and would be great if it worked as it was supposed to unfortunately, this isn't the case."
2,Compatibility,"This MP3 player doesn't have a Windows NT/2000 compatibility! I work with NT, i have a 2000, so where I save my music??? I don't save, i don't hear and I don't use it!I am seeling my RUSH because I bought it a 2 weeks ago and I neither test it!!!"
4,Ijoy 130,"I've had this chair for almost 2 months and have used it almost everyday for at least one 15 minute cycle, usually two and sometimes more. So far, so great with one exception, it doesn't have any vibration mode. Other than that, it does what it's supposed to do and I've enjoyed using it. Just an FYI for those who have problems getting up and out of things, it is low to the ground."
2,Stunningly Poor Design,"My wife and I tested this chair at a Linens and Things. We were interested since we both have bad backs. The main problem we both complained about is the chair doesn't seem to be designed for the people who could get the most good out of it, i.e. those with bad backs. It is so low to the ground it is almost impossible to get in or out of without pain. Many old people, of course, have back problems and it is difficult for them to get down close to the floor where this chair sits."
1,future prospects of the world according to the bible code,I found this book to be new age and not based on God's word the Bible. Very disappointing read. Threw it in the trash. A waste of sixteen dollars.
2,Go lightly!,"The previous reviewer is a fundamentalist without the fun part.""Damming to the soul""?!? Not very christian. Perhaps the reviewer would like to discuss the Empress Theodora's 4th century censorship of the Bible? Reincarnation was in it then!The misunderstood mission of Jesus was to end reincarnation by forgiving one's enemies- something the reviewer should try, if he realy wants to be a Christian."
5,"Very highly recommended, ""user friendly"" reading","Marketing Your Dreams: Business And Life Lessons From Bill Veeck, Baseball's Marketing Genius will prove of immense interest and value both to those who are baseball enthusiasts and those who would like to apply real-life advice and inspiration from a supremely successful entrepreneur who chose the field of marketing baseball to the American public. Very highly recommended, ""user friendly"" reading, Marketing Your Dreams blends sound ""how to"" information with real life examples, and in doing so presents the reader with a wealth of marketing approaches, attitudes, ideas, examples and experiences that can be transferred and adapted to any entrepreneurial endeavor in or out of professional sports."
3,Pet hamster carrier,"I liked the size and portability of this carrier; however, the clasp on top is very hard to fasten/unfasten. My grandson has a hard time with it. I tried to just bend the clasp a bit but it didn't work too well."
5,Small Bird carrier too!!,"Delighted with quality, customer service, and promptness. I use this item to transport a Parrotlett."
5,Great music,There's a lots of good music here. I think that it's worth a listen even if you're not a fan of Aeon Flux.
2,Just more schtick,"I'm getting kind of over the same old schtick all the time. WHy is it that Jews always self depricate? God knows, the Christians never do that. They're very proud all the time. Jews seem to come off ""silly"" and sophomoric. I suppose this compilation is pretty comprehensive as far as artists, but it sure would be nice if someone put an album together that had a little more heart to it."
5,Great,Used to buy it in the Petland but they don't carry it anymore and my dog doesn't like other type. This is a great product.
4,great review book,"This review book really helped me in school and taking the registries. I have taken ARRT(S), ARDMS SPI, AB, and RVT in which I was able to pass all the first time. Word of caution though some of the answers are incorrect. But all in all its a pretty good review for Sonography."
5,Great Book! Good for review!,This is a good choice! It has a lot of questions that are helpful for review.
1,Horrible!,"I bought this vitamin and I only took one pill, instead of the 2 as the directions say. I ended up passing out and had a headache and shakiness for the rest of the day. I have never felt worse or more scared! This thing needs to be taken off the market!"
2,Not Impressed,"Pros: Large and roomyCons: Inferior materialsWe bought this tent for our family of 6. It is plenty big, and my kids loved having enough room to play tag. The first time we set the tent up the floor started to rip where the poles connect to the tent floor. The floor was reinforced in this area, but not enough to prevent damage. The zippers also felt flimsy, especially in the shoe nook. We will be looking for another tent."
5,"Excellent, instructive narrative","This is an excellent, instructive narrative about the healing powers of psychotherapy."
2,Tastes Great but Something is Missing!,"I read the book ""How to get on Radio Talk Show..."" and I found it interesting yet missing something. The book shows you the procedures to get on the radio shows but leaves out the radio stations,telephone numbers,call letters and the names of the shows. For $30.00 dollars it should have provided an appendix containing this information. Instead, you must send away for the list on a diskette. The book without the diskette is like a recipe telling you whats in a dish but not including the amounts of each ingredient."
1,body solidgpm65,"we own 4 other pieces of exercise equipment and this machine is a very inferior product compared to all of the others.no directions supplied,extremely noisey it squeaks constantly,one arm is loose,the seat is tiny and uncomfortable .i would return it but after all the effort to assemble and the shipping cost i'll just let it sit and take up space.rating it a 2 from 1-10."
4,"""Plate Loaded"" does not mean it is loaded with plates","Good, sturdy product. Buyers should note that ""plate loaded"" means that the weights are added by plates. It does not mean that the product comes loaded with plates. If you don't already have weights that fit the diameter of this type of machine, then this will result in (perhaps substantial) additional cost."
2,Snore - asis,What could have been a vey interesting DVD about one of the more important groups of the moment turns out to be an exercise in self-adulation by a group of certainly talented but over-rated musicians.
3,POOR QUALITY video production,"Received this blu-ray as a gift and couldn't wait to get it on. This is another one of those blu-ray discs that simply isn't blu-ray quality. Unfortunately, the other blu-ray title gifted to me was Elton John's Red Piano Concert, the video quality of which, once again is appalling.I did wonder if there's something wrong with my blu-ray player (Panasonic BD80) but a google search reveals quite a view similar comments about the poor video quailty of these discs.I'm not saying 'Don't Buy' (well certainly not the Oasis disc, which is watchable though not brilliant) but be aware you're not getting the video quality you should expect from a blu-ray format."
2,In agreement with other reviewer,"If the description is true, then why bother. I wonder why the NTSC version is so different than the PAL version that is both longer and has the extra disc with the Manchester concert on it."
5,speaks to you,"This is a really good book, the only one I've read in the Powerlink Chronicles. It has made me want to read a lot of them. I have read it several times, but this last time I read it (I finished it again today), it really helped me with some issues that I've been dealing with. Along with dc Talk's Jesus Freaks, this is my favorite book. I definitely recommend it to anyone. Also, even though you may think that the Inside Story is boring and just want to know what happenes with Brittney and her crew, you should really check out the Inside story."
2,Too small,"Don't be fooled, these bags are small. Size jumbo is very deceiving. The quality of the bag itself is fine but I can barely fit a whole load of laundry in one bag. If you are looking for a BIG laundry bag, this is NOT for you!"
3,Not really Jumbo,"A reasonable laundry bag, just not ""Jumbo"" as described. Luckily I had ordered another ""Jumbo"" laundry bag that had the size listed (28 by 38) and that is perfect for what I wanted."
2,Ripped during first use,"I bought two of these - one yellow and one blue - to use during a recent trip. I used these for dirty laundry, and I didn't come close to filling them. I transported them inside of a suitcase, so they weren't dragged around. Nevertheless, when I got home the yellow one had a big rip in the seam. I considered repairing it, but the material was to frayed for a simple repair. The blue one appears to have weathered the trip okay."
4,Very happy with this purchase!,"The price was definately right, and the installation was pretty easy. It makes such a difference in the heat distribution in our living room! It is a little noisy, but we feel that this is a good trade off for the benefits it brings."
4,fireplace blower fan,The blower was packaged well and arrived in good condition. It was extremely easy to install due to the magnetic mount. It is quiet and works well. I can honestly say anyone could install this fan.
2,Poor quality...,Good air output BUT blower squeaks relentlessly and loudly while spinning and the magnets will not hold the blower in a suspended position (i.e. resisting gravity). Not happy with this purchase.
4,Very good value.,"I ordered two of these blowers for unvented fireplaces. They arrived on time in good condition. They were very simple to install, and seem to work well. They are a little noisy, but within reasonable limits. I think they are a very good buy, and would recommend them."
2,Handle with care - wiring breaks easily,"This product is loud and has several poorly soldered connections (2 of which broke trying to place in our fireplace).It is powerful enough to blow air throughout our downstairs and was worth the money, but if you don't have a soldering iron consider ordering one at the same time."
3,"Not bad, but could have more","This is a good size reference book of formulas, and it has a lot in it, although I was a little surprised at what it didn't have in it. I liked that it had a notes page with each table to add the things I use most without having to cram stuff in the margins, but I really thought the geometric section properties chapter could've used more sections for a book of formulas. It had all the basics, like many other engineering reference books include in an appendix, but I would've liked to see shortcuts for more non-typical sections that you can't find elsewhere. Also, a table for cantilever members like AISC Table 3-22 (I believe) would've been nice. Otherwise, a pretty good reference that's much smaller and easier to grab than the AISC 13th edition or other references that have similar tables spread throughout them."
1,Over rated,"The ratings here are way too high. This book has tiny print and nearly half the pages are blank for ""notes"". Many of the formulas are already contained in the AISC Steel Manual which most structural engineers already have, so there is little to no value to the book in my opinion. Wasted money relying on the other high reviews here."
1,This stuff is awful!!!!!,"I tried this with great expectations only to almost gag when the first forkfull of angel hair spaghetti and this dried tomato sauce hit my mouth. It was truly discusting! I threw out all the remaining packages because I wasn't going to ruin any more noodles with this crap. Goodness, just thinking about how it tasted makes me feel like heaving! I can't even explain why it was so terrible but, to me, it was. The other reviewer liked it but...it's up to you to try it and decide for yourself. Good Luck!!"
5,Excellent starter volume,"Ok, so, this is a good book. If you are interested in the history of science or just physics, and you want to break into primary sources but feel a little overwhelmed, then I recommend going ahead and buying this book, because it's cheap, and flipping to the first chapter that catches your eye. You will probably like what you see: English translation of texts by Galileo, Boyle, Cavendish, etc., which are short excerpts of the ""good part"". In the margins, there are commentaries to help you out with archaic language and ""weirder"" aspects. Now you're cooking! You can go on to other reading if you want."
3,"It is OK, but...","The book includes some 20 important experiments like the gravitation by Galileo, Newton, Cavendish; the nature of light by Young, Fresnel (but not Newton!); electromagnetism by Oersted, Faraday, Lenz, Hertz; discovery of atom and electron structures like Thomson, Millikan, Rutherford, Chadwick; thermodynamics by Joule. But it is far from complete: it doesn't contain the second law of thermodynamics, the Michelson-Morray experiments and many others."
5,"Smells good, works well.",Cleaning wheels is really easy with this product and it smells great. Dirt comes off really easy with a soft brush and a rinse.
4,an experiment on how to use the same character,"MAISIE is based on an interesting premise. Take the same girl with the same personality traits and put her in various situations (ranch, congo, gold rush, etc.) and see what happens. You really have to suspend belief because each time she meets and falls in love with someone different, so when you move on to the next movie you are wondering what happened to the last guy. I loved Ann Sothern in her TV work and so I was curious to see these. They are Warner Brothers Archive films, so there are usually no extras, but you get a good copy that will hold up well on a small screen."
2,Agree! Too large!,"Wish I'd seen the other review before! I too have a Brother sewing machine and the bulb was too large for mine too!Not sure how to rate this because the bulb may fit other machines. I'm giving it a 2 because that's the rating for ""I don't like it"" - and I don't! It doesn't fit!"
3,Festering,"Black thrash album originally released in 1993. I think they are German. Mostly mid-pace black metal with some thrash riffs and rhythm playing. Other atmospheric elements too. Interesting, and as far as i know, only release from Fester. Definitely of interest compared to the Norwegian scene at the same time. Good, above average, black metal, although, Nagelfar's H√ºnengrab im Herbst from 1997 is Germany's crowning Black Metal jewel."
4,Colorstar - 'Heavenicetrip!' (Bahia Music),"Some first class Hungarian psych/space rock here.Or you could describe 'Heavenicetrip' as progressive trancedelic if you like.I notice that guitarist Andras Keleti provides some way-out recitals in a few places.Best tracks are ""Indul""(sort of reminds me of Anubian Lights),the Ozric-ish title cut ""Heavenicetrip"",the trippy ""I Am Robot"" and ""Six Steps on The Moon"".Should appeal to fans of fellow Hungarian space rockers Korai Orom,Dead Flowers,Omnia Opera and Krom Lek."
2,Terrible mix up,"I've ordered this product before with no problems. This time was very different. When I received the order, it was 2 HP ink cartridges instead of 2 Super Curcimin. I returned the order and did receive the correct order, but it took a long time."
1,A BIG mistake!!,"[[ASIN:B000X9P5GM Super Curcumin, 800mg, 60 vegetarian capsules]]I should have specified the newer Super Bio-Curcumin, which, I believe, is an improvement over this product which does not have the sustained retention time of the more recently developed product, Super Bio-Curcumin.Correct me if I'm wrong."
2,Wasn't helpful for Precalc.,"I had high hopes that this video could help my 11th grader with precalculus. He has always been a good math student but really struggled with this class. The instructor on the video jumps around with the topics and didn't explain some of the concepts very well. We ended up hiring a private tutor. Unfortunately, this item was not helpful for us."
3,A+ IS NOT TRUE,"When I brought this my first impression was this could replace my book WRONG this will only help if you read the text or understand your teacher in class. The title is very misleading ""caution a+"". bottomline you have to read the text didnt help me but give it a try."
5,Best Pre-Calculus CLEP prep on the market,This video series was the only resource I used to study for the Pre-Calculus CLEP exam. The video approach is very effective for self study and review.
3,"Dry, but helpful","I used this while in college. It did help me get an A in Pre-cal. It was a little dry. The lesons were strait foward. No CGI or graphix. I did find it useful, but maybe younger students might find it a little boring."
1,"Very poor quality, flimsy and scratchy material","Why is it that a lot of children's bedding manufacturers make horrible quality bedding for children? This bedding in particular is terrible. For one thing the material is almost translucent. The worst part however, is how scratchy the material is. I washed it over and over in fabric softner and dried with dryer sheets, to no avail. The sheets remained stiff and scratchy. You might as well cover you kid's bed in brillo pads! Try Olive Kid's sheets, ther're softer and just as cute."
2,Living Water,"It was an ok movie, missing something. You can tell the actors were first time or had not had enough acting experience."
5,Incredible Album,"I heard one song from this album on Spinner and thought I'd give the album a try, though I'd never listened to any Japanese bands before.Anyway- this is one hell of a CD, and a shot in the arm for anyone who's only heard American and British alternative music. They've got a very distinctive sound that beats the pants off 97% of the music I've heard here in America lately.Their sound might be compared to Catherine Wheel's early stuff or perhaps Smashing Pumpkins. Anyway- it's the best CD I've heard in about a year and you need it."
4,A very good C/C++ book,"It contains the most simple and basic code that any one can handle, even if you are not very skillful with C, you can follow the text. It is very well developed and for begginers is just great."
3,Should be complete,"Finally the bulk of MTB remastered. Sounds very good, BUT where the hell is ""This ol' Cowboy"" and ""Never Trust A Stranger""? With 30 songs in a two disc set, this is unforgivable."
2,Missing too many classic MTB songs...,"After I purchased this collection, I was very disappointed to see how many great songs by MTB were missing, especially the notable absences of ""This Ol' Cowboy"", ""Blue Ridge Mountain Sky"", ""Another Cruel Love"", and ""Hillbilly Band"". This would have been a nice overview of a band that I had no CDs of, but now I regret not tracking down the (out-of-print) ""The Best of the Marshall Tucker Band: The Capricorn Years"" double CD set."
3,I would avoid this.,"This is a good starting point if you can get this free and listen to it. Otherwise go with the albums. The lush sound of the album CD's are for home stereo. Buy the DVD from 1981 MTV concert before it goes out of print. There is black & white footage of Winterland in the 70's that exists , ala Skynyrd."
5,Excellent CD set,"This compilation is fantastic! Delivery was quick - came when expected. If you're a Marshall Tucker fan, you will really like this set and the price is very good."
4,Very enjoyable,I am glad I made this purchase. I really enjoy Marshall Tucker and the bonus is that this is a two CD set. Lots more songs to listen to!
4,Great 2 Disc Set!,"While this doesn't have all of The Marshall Tucker Band's greatest hits, none of them do in my experience, it is still an awesome collection of one of the most underrated bands in their genre. ""This Ol' Cowboy"" isn't on the Anthology, which is why it didn't get a 5 star rating from me. There are two recorded versions of this song that I know of, one done by the band and one Toy Caldwell did on his solo album. I have both, so it isn't a big deal that it wasn't on this set.Although not complete, I highly recommend this to any Marshall Tucker fan."
3,I second Mike S.,"To leave off ""this ole cowboy"" is inexcusable, or a gross mistake. Listen to that song, and you'll agree."
2,too much left off,"Agree with both the other reviews, but ""Desert Skies"" is the missing song that changed my mind. I will not be buying this either."
1,They forgot to add This Old Cowboy,Too bad one of MT's best songs isn't on the CD. Sending the CD back for a refund.
1,Marshall Tucker Anthology,"Not at all what I expected. Other than the material that was over played on the radio, the rest of the cd was boring and monotonous. The song I really wanted to hear, ""24 Hrs. at a Time"", turns out is only good in the live version not included on this cd. This cd will definitely gather dust on my shelf"
2,Where is This Old Cowboy,"Its one of their most popular songs and in my opinion, their best song. This can't be an accidental oversight- it's done so you have to buy this one and then buy another one to get This Old Cowboy. A trick to double their sales but if you fork out the big bucks for this 2cd set, you expect it to include the basics."
1,DGB,"I was a huge fan of the original Marshall Tucker Band and was very dissapointed to know that Doug Gray tours with his own band under the name of the Marshall Tucker Band. When Tommy Caldwell tragically crashed his Jeep while returning home to Spartanburg, South Carolina on April 28, 1980 the band essentially died. Even though they tried to carry on with Franklin Wilkie, the band couldn't play without Tommy. So for Doug, though a talented singer, to try to continue the legend of the MTB by using his own bands songs on an Anthology CD of 30 years of the MTB is a crime when the band only played together for 7 years. Though the band had many guest musicians on tour and vinyl the inclusion of a family tree is a joke. No, I won't be paying for this collection."
4,a good choice,"If you are any degree of a Marshall Tucker fan, this cd is a good choice for you. It combines many of the songs you remember with a few that you may not be familiar with but will also enjoy listening to."
4,Great Collection,I liked disc #1 as it is a great collection of the MT band's more popular stuff.I did have to buy idividual albums to get some of the songs not on this album ( see my other review) Disc Two contains music from the later reincarnation of the M T band after the Caldwell Brothers Died I never much cared for this band eventhough they recorded a few great tracks.
1,Not for Chinchilla,"Despite what it says, this carrier was not made for a chinchilla or any other rodent that likes the taste of plastic. My chins pretty much destroyed this thing within a month of very occasional use. First they chewed on the lining, and then somehow one of them got their teeth on the zipper and disseminated it."
4,"Great carrier, just have a size issue","I ordered the medium sized carrier for my guinea pig, but I'm thinking I'll have to return it and get a large carrier instead. He doesn't have enough room in it to move around as I'd like him to have, and his head touches the top of the carrier. Other than that I have no complaints. The walls seem to be very sturdy, I love the material used for both inside (it looks easy to clean and won't be ruined with urine) and outside, and I love the window in the front. I'd recommend this carrier for anybody wanting to take their furry friends from point A to point B. :) And I'd also like to say it arrived to my home quickly, even before the date I was expecting it to!"
5,GET TRAVEL ACCOMADATIONS,THE GIRLS (2) LOVE TRAVELING IN THERE OWN TOTE WITH A SMALL BLANKET THEY ARE READY TO GO - I AM AFRAID EVENTUALLY THEY WILL CHEW THROUGH IT LIKE THEY DO EVERYTHING ELSE LOL
4,Good chair--bad delivery,"I ordered this chair and it came within the week, as promised. However, the delivery company only made one attempt to deliver this chair. They misled me about scheduling a convenient delivery, two times. It was only after the shipper intervened, that I got my shipment. In short,seller good, delivery bad."
1,Died Immediately,"Was given this item new as a Christmas present. Was initially impressed with it's light wieght and speedy data transfer. However, after using it for only a few minutes, it began making a clicking noise and got excessively hot. Now neither Windows nor Linux will recognize the unit, and it continues to click and burn up.Great product for the first 5 minutes, but presumably, it's reliability isn't that impressive. Go with another brand."
3,Where's the proofreader?,"This interesting collection of essays on the historical reception of comics by intellectuals is marred by a inexcusable number of typos and print errors. University Press of Mississippi should be applauded for all the titles it has published on comics scholarship, but the editorial sloppiness in this title is a disservice to the reader and the field."
2,Little Help for Me,I heard a lot about this book and I thought it would help me deal with my coming out dilemma. but I guess its my parents who needs understanding and not me. So this book doesn't help at all in that area as my parents are not English-speaking or understanding.I would like to know if there are some similar books that are available in Hindi for the Indian population.Or may be a translation version would be of great help.
1,Awful,"What a mistake this purchase was! I bought it for a young lesbian friend, to help her in her coming-out conversation with her parents. It had been recommended by an older gay man. It is stuck in the 70's and is highly unlikely to be of any use in my friend's coming out process. If you want a bit of historical perspective, steel yourself and read this. Otherwise, don't bother."
3,Good value for the money,"This is a good inexpensive carrier for occasional use. It is smaller than I expected; my two rats fit inside comfortably enough for brief periods, but I wouldn't leave them in there for more than half an hour or so. It's a safe place to contain them while cleaning their real cage, or riding to the vet."
1,Fell apart and rats dropped to the floor,"This is a pretty good cage for transporting rats when the bottom is supported, but when carrying the cage by the handle, the plastic bottom of the cage came unhooked, dropping our pet rats to the floor. The plastic tabs on the bottom of the cage do not secure well to the metal sides. We are going to use zip ties to permananently connect the plastic bottom to the metal top. Since the whole top opens up, you don't necessarily need to disconnect the bottom from the top, unless you plan to do it for cleaning. Our reason for rating this as a 1 star cage is directly related to the compromised safety of our rats."
2,Just okay...,"This is the first carrier I ever purchased for our guinea pigs a number of years ago, and it held up quite well while it was being used. Eventually, though, I retired it because it turned out to be a less than ideal carrier for trips to the vet, and switched to a hard-sided cat carrier. My issues with it are:1. The Medium carrier is okay-ish for small guinea pigs, but larger pigs have no room to move around, and have a hard time not getting their feet/toes snagged while being put in or taken out;2. There is no good way to attach a water bottle;3. The pet is not protected from rain/wind/whatever unless you use a cover with it;4. It cannot be secured in the car with a seatbeltIt's not necessarily a *bad* carrier for small critters like hamsters or gerbils (I think we may have used it with a hamster a couple of times for a short trip to the vet), but for an adult guinea pig, or for traveling with any small animal, it's not really adequate."
1,Did not even get it,I got this to go along with a carrier made of bad material that my guinea pig chewed really badly that it needs to be replaced. This would have prevented him from messing it up but unfortunately could not use it. The company cancelled my order and waited for my other purchase to go to waste. Going to get a better carrier soon.
5,Great!,"Just finished a bowl of cereal with these, they are great. My roommates like them as well, no issues so far and its been about a year."
5,Great Silverware,"we've had it for about 5 months and I have nothing but good things to say. They feel sturdy in your hands, are easy to use at meals, and overall contribute to a great dining experience at home. We had a Dansk set, which from what I understood was supposed to be great quality, but it started rusting soon after we got it - no dishwasher either. The set we had before that was a Pfaltzgraf and it was really nice but not available anymore. We didn't like any of the newer stuff they had. So I did some online research and found that in the past few years it's really hard to tell what your buying anymore because many of the traditionally excellent manufacturers have been trying to cut corners in order to keep up with lower prices. I'm not sure where this set was made, but am I glad we chose this set."
4,Good dea for the price,"This dinnerware set is an OK deal. There are a few ""rough"" spots on the silverware handles but I think it is well worth the money invested."
2,The Beginner's Guide The Female Nude Art Tutorial,"This art instruction book leaves a lot to be desired. The illustrations of the final results of the drawing projects really suck. It's more of a ""How to draw like crap"" tutorial. Books such as ""Drawing the Head and Figure"", by Jack Hamm and ""Fantasy Females"", by Tom Flemming are much better and well worth their purchase price."
3,Truly for beginners...,"The book is ""okay."" I'd have preferred something a bit more instructive on the basics of drawing nudes, perhaps broken down by parts of the body, then by various pose types (sitting, reclining, etc.). Instead, this lightly touches on drawing nudes, and instead concentrates on rendering them in a variety media. Tries to do too many things, and accomplishes none well. I'd look for a different title..."
4,A Poignant Story,"Mother's Day invites the reader to stand with the author between two panes of full length mirrows. Together you look left through a succession of historical reflections that tell you, you are standing in the present. Then, the story reflects upon the author's role as wife and mother projected through the images on the right as they curve into infinity. A poignant tale, well written and with which anyone can identify."
4,Skier's Delight- Documentary not Rockumentary,"Much of the DVD is footage of the band skiing and interviews with band members. Concert footage is limited. If you are intersted in learning more about the band and seeing some nice ski footage this is for you (Warren Miller filmed the band skiing). If you are intersted in nice long Cheese jams, buy something from the On The Road Series or wait for their full-length concert DVD from the Denver Fillmore which is scheduled to be released in Summer 2003."
2,"Disappointing, again and again...","I am a clinical psychology graduate student, and every time I turn to this book for help related to interpretation--what a part of the test means or can tell us about a person--I am sorely disappointed. It is terribly psychometric and formal, giving facts about the test but few clues for what to do with it; even something as simple as a useful description of one of the index scores is lacking. There are reference tables included, but I have found even those more difficult to locate when I need them than seems necessary. Frustrating..."
1,No info on how to score the test,"I bought this book because it was claimed that it would explain how to score the wais-iii. It does explain how to count up the scores on the subtests but the only information on how to score it was a referral to the program to score it. I don't have the program, I want to score it myself. Very frustrating."
5,Couldn't put it down!,"This book was even better than Hard Landing, Heitman's first book! I was drawn into the plot from the very first chapter. It was the kind of book you don't want to finish because you will miss the characters! Hope the next Heitman book will be out soon. Love her characters, plot and writing!"
2,Pretty mediocre,"Above average comic book fare, but not even in the same plane as Watchmen or V for Vendetta. I would suggest looking elsewhere. From Hell and Swamp Thing are also both supposed to be very good."
3,Pretty mediocre,"Above average comic book superhero fare, but unfortunately that's not saying too much. Enjoyable, but no depth--but not even in the same plane as Watchmen or V for Vendetta. I would suggest looking elsewhere. From Hell and Swamp Thing are also both supposed to be very good"
3,Just a quicky,"I'm currently rating ALL of the clanbooks(since I own them all and the I Own It button has vanished) so here are my words on this. It's good, like them all, but not a clan I favor."
4,purdy good,"I color my hair alot, and this doesnt dry it out or fry it like most bleaches. I recomend this if you dont want your hair damaged!"
4,Shape your Repertoire.,"This book is an excellent introduction to the most solid openings in chess. All the openings used by World Champions are covered, and indexed by percentage of use. I found this book to be a great tool in shaping my opening repertoire."
1,Save your Money,"I am just an intermediate player about 1600. Now since i have been into a chess a lot more and play a lot more games I have noticed that these books do not help you at all. All this book has is a reproduction of the games played by the world champions, with annotations(not originally from the author). If your are interested to know the games and get the statistics get some software like Fritz or Chessbase which will be of great help to your game, and will get rid of these books completly. Since I have the database of all the games in the book and more maybe I should publish a book or two too, which must earn me some fast bucks!. I have also noticed that Eric Shiller has a lot of books which are usually a ""CUT"" from Database and ""PASTE"" into Book."
5,"the words ""page-turner"" work for this novel!","I've been stuck before by the hype a publisher gives a first time author. This time, however, the reviews are accurate. Lori Fairweather's first novel, Blood and Water, is first rate, one that I wish I'd written myself. The plot moves quickly with enough twists and turns to keep the reader turning the page; in fact, I took the book along with me to the movies last night so that I could read while I waited for the lights to dim, I was that hooked! The characters, too, are richly drawn. Fran is likeable; her relationship with Peter is realistic; her need to know about her twin sister's death is finely crafted--the push and pull of their relationship (as well as the truth about their own father) is temptingly revealed, the way such knowledge might be revealed in real life. Lori Fairweather clearly has a career as a mystery writer ahead of her!"
4,Good Book,"Good coverage of wood design. This is a text book, so it makes a good (not great) reference."
4,Israel in Egypt - Baroque Recording,"A wonderful recording of Handel's fifth oratorio. Ian Bostridge is fantastic, as are the other soloists. The King's College Choir is exemplary. I purchased this recording to use as preparation for singing the piece myself. I did not realize when I ordered it that it was recorded on baroque instruments (and therefore in a lower key), and would have prefered a recording on modern instruments for practicing."
2,Veg Out is out of touch,"As someone who lives in the SF Bay Area, and frequented many of the restaurants reviewed in this guide, I was disappointed. While everyone has different tastes in foods, I particularly disagreed with her review of Shangri-La which ridiculed the menu and its grammar. Not everyone had the opportunity to grow up in the USA. Additionally, perhaps it is the nature of publishing or the dynamic flow of the restaurant business, but this guide is already out of date."
1,Don't trust it.,"I skimmed through this book in a local bookstore-- VEGANS BEWARE. The authors of this book have no idea what they are talking about- for instance the crepes at All You Knead Cafe are listed as vegan fare. My girlfriend works at this restaurant and I am sorry to say the crepes have and always have had egg and milk in them. Definitely NOT vegan. Who knows how many other mistakes they made. If you're gonna write a book, do some friggin' research....."
3,decent,"I picked up this book when I first moved to San Francisco. As a vegan I was so excited to have it, but looking through it I was disappointed to find that there weren't many vegan restaurants and the reviews of the restaurants were not all that great. Well after being here a year I found that this book has a lot of restaurants left out, of course that could be because this book was printed in 2004. It is also frustrating that the majority of the places listed are not pure vegetarian places and certainly not vegan places. If you are completely new to the area this book is a decent starting place, but you would fare better with an internet search or picking up a Friends of the Animals Guide or Sf Natural Pages. This book has good potential but needs to be updated and written by a vegetarian who is not a snob!"
5,Perfect for the college student to prepare for PA School Admissions,"I purchased this book during my second year of college, knowing I wanted to go to PA School. This book was wonderful, it helped me out so much. It told you what to expect, what to do and had many great examples of essays and interview questions. Although my GPA and GRE scores weren't the highest, this book taught me to bring my motivation and compassion to my application and later on my interview. I was accepted to the PA Program of my choice! I would recommened this to any younger student preparing for their first PA school admissions."
5,"""Getting into the Physician Assistant School of Your Choice""","This book was in great condition! It was exactly what I expected and it was very helpful to me in preparing for my interviews, I wish I had found it before I had completed the rest of the application process. It also came more quickly than I expected. It was great!"
4,New Applying to PA School Book Available,"My wife read this book when applying to PA school, but was dissapointed that it had not been updated for many years. After completing and subsequently teaching in PA school, she wrote her own book on applying to PA school, which she recently listed on Amazon:An Applicant's Guide to Physician Assistant School and Practice.While she would not foist her book on anyone, I have no such reservations. After reading her book (many times), I highly recommend checking out her book in addition to Mr. Rodican's."
4,Very helpful guide.,"I found this book very helpful. It started by going through the PA profession, and then got into how to actually go about making this a career. It explains each step of the application process, and gives very helpful tips. Overall, this was a great book. I would highly recommend it for anyone considering entering the PA profession."
4,"Did not get into PA school, but had great info on how to follow up",I applied to a number of PA programs in 2010 and was not chosen for an interview. I thought I was a great candidate and wanted to look for what areas I had been lacking and could improve on my application. This book had a number of insightful suggestions as well as ways to pursue your aspiration of getting into the program of your choice if you have been turned down.
3,"outdated, but still somewhat relevant","This was the only book that came up in my search for PA interviews, so I assumed it was the only one out there. I purchased it and the section about the interview process was very helpful, but when I read the rest of the book, it was pretty outdated. There is a more recent version of this book by the same author but it has a different name. If you need guidance through the application process, I recommend the newer version because it has websites that work and explains the CASPA online application process, which is what most PA programs use now. If this version is cheaper and you just need guidance for an interview, this book is probably just as good."
3,A little over hyped,"Overall good for the Pre-PA who has done little to no research on the profession or admission into PA programs. I bought this book along with others in order to prepare for PA school applications and interviews. Though it is somewhat helpful in a general sense, I felt that it wasn't as concise as it should have been with the author talking a lot about himself in many section intros. It also has some out of date information and has a lot of information that is commonly found online. IN the end it didn't give me any AH-HAH moments."
4,Very helpful,"I found this book to be extremely helpful. The book is comprehensively written to walk you through the steps of the application process starting at the very beginning with essays, then interviews, and even the ""what happens next if I am not accepted?"" I purchased this book late in the game (after I had sent my applications and found out that I was invited for interviews), but the interview prep section was amazingly helpful and entirely worth the purchase. This book has several pages of possible questions alongside appropriate answers with insights that allow you to formulate your own personalized and thoughtful answers. I am glad I purchased this book because I was accepted to P.A. school, and it may be due to its assistance with my interview preparation!"
3,Marginally helpful,"This book's info is antiquated at best. The author has nice writing examples for personal statements, but CASPA's essay does not allow an essay of this length. The info for deadline dates, as well as tutition is no longer correct for most schools.The sample interview questions are generic, but the author does give decent insight into what the interviewees may be wanting to hear. I would not spend to money asked for full price on this book, but perhaps a used copy would worth it."
3,Vibe - Zhane',"US CD Maxi Single Track Listing for -""VIBE"" - ZHANE'1) LP Version - 3:302) Groove Theory Mix - 3:513) Reel Swinga Mix - 3:344) Maurice's Club Edit - 3:525) Reel Swinga Instrumental - 3:301994"
1,Out-of-date science fiction,"When I started reading this book I began to wonder if I was reading the script from ""Hanger 18"" - a B grade science fiction movie from the '80's.It is simply unbelievable and comes across as a simplistic attempt to seem profound."
3,upon recommendation from John Lear,"I purchased this as an ebook upon the recommendations of John Lear, an avid UFOlogist. John seemed to think that the writer had some contact or personal insight of UFO's or EBE's as to write this book as fact not fiction. I would take it more as fiction than fact. Its just too far fetched to beleive it to be true. The writing also drags on with regards to the hand held objects found in a craft. It makes for some good fiction but not very believeable. I'd give this book a 3 stars at most. There are better books on the subject out there. Well, I only paid 99 cents for it, but maybe 98 cents too much."
4,Banana Plugs replaced damaged ones well,"I really only needed this because the female banana plug piece broke, so I didn't need the binding posts but the new jacks did the trick!"
2,Not really a book for VB.NET web programming.,"If you are new to VB.NET web programming and want to learn it, look somewhere else. The book gives more of an overview of the .NET framework and less actual VB.NET web programming.Part of Page 11 Paragraph 1 of the book states it best:""At least 90% of the material you need to learn is related to the .NET Framework, not to Visual Basic. We therefore don't try to teach Visual Basic, but assume you have at least a fundamental knowledge of the language."""
2,Dosen't measure up to SAMS standard.,"This book tries to please both the beginner and the experienced programmer coming from VB6, however it does a below average task of both.The task of explaining .NET and how to fully utilize VB .NET is not a task for one book, and this book does not claim to do this, instead it jumps back and forth between subjects and forgets some very important topics that are not even mentioned?I must say I'm sorry I bought this books, and I have bought SAMS books before that are of much higher quality! This is nothing that will discourage me from buying SAMS other titles, but I would look elsewhere for a VB.NET introduction."
3,Lots of Selective Breeding Information with Photos,"Don't let the number of pages fool you. This book has small pages, big type, and lots of photos, but not a lot of information. It does go into selective breeding pretty deeply, though, and has plenty of information about outdoor ponds. The rest is very general. Very little about water chemistry. Not bad for the price. The book I got is not the one pictured with the goldfish & black background, but the 1996 edition with blue-green aquatic plant background."
4,Translucent Pink,"I purchased this cover for use with my Blackberry Pearl phone. I always keep a cover on it because I drop it on the ground about two times a week. This cover does a good job of protecting the phone from breaking when it hits the cement.My phone is black, so the translucent pink tone gives it a unique look. The only down side is that it does slip around in my car as I drive around. The rubber-like cases stick better to your car's console but they are hard to throw in your pocket or purse because of their inability to slide in easily. That's the trade-off.This cover also fits well and is easy to snap on into place."
3,Is that all there is?,"I'll admit I've not yet read this book, although I've been looking forward to it since I became aware of its existence.Upon learning of the list of contributors to COMICS CREATORS ON FANTASTIC FOUR, I became disappointed rather quickly. Yeah, there're a lot of creators featured that have been associated with Marvel's First Family of Heroes, but there are some significant talents not included that I was looking forward to seeing in this book - people like Gerry Conway, Rich Buckler, Len Wein, Marv Wolfman, Roger Stern, Sal Buscema, Jerry Ordway, Chris Claremont and Carlos Pacheco. I'm hoping there's a good reason for this apparent oversight by DeFalco.Your mileage may vary.Nonetheless, I will be picking this book up as soon as I am able."
3,My first A.C. book,Haven't read Agatha Christie before as I'm not a big mystery fan. The characters and their relationships to each other were interesting.
4,"Yea, Agatha Christie",Agatha Christie never fails to get your attention! One does not want to put the book down until the very end!
5,Very good read,"I am a huge fan of Agatha Christie. All of her characters make lasting impressions on me, especially Hercule Poirot."
4,Always a good read,Agatha Christie never disappoints. There were alot of twists and turns in this book. The ending was a surpise but Poirots line of deducing was masterful. As always Poirot triumps to find the culprit.
3,Just okay,"I admit that I'm not a regular Agatha Christie reader, but I found this book to be just so so as a murder mystery. The writing was spare and the circumstances somewhat contrived. The murderer's m.o. was also a bit hard to believe. Poirot is not all that interesting either. I was entertained while reading, but by the end, I wondered if it was worth my time."
4,classic but not much to do with christmas,"We chose this book for our mystery book group fo December because of the title. The book is a classic Poroit book with lots of red herrings, a locked room murder and a bit of a surprise ending. I enjoyed the book and I think there will be quite a bit of discussion about what holidays are like in a disfunctional family."
3,Just couldn't get there...,"I'm a life-long Christie reader (and that's quite a few decades), but this one left me as cold as Christmas at the North Pole. Just could NOT push my way through it, and Poirot hadn't appeared a good number of pages in, so I had to give up."
5,Classic detective fiction,Hercule Poirot is at his best in this classic who-dun-it by Christiel The clues are very subtle and easily missed. But the ending is satisfying.
4,Another surprise.,"Agatha Christie books are all fabulous, this was no exception. Really enjoyed reading it. Hercule Poirot is my all-time favorite!"
4,I like Hercule Poirot's stories.,I would recommend this book to other Poirot's fans. It is intriguing and held my attention. I could not leave this lay for long because I had to know who did the crime. It was a surprise..
3,"Great story, but can't change fonts","This is a great book, like most of Agatha Christie's, and the format is clean and high quality, but, at least on my Kindle Paperwhite, the font style refused to change. I could change the font size, but the style stayed Helvetica, even when I selected Palatino or one of the others. Helvetica isn't one of my favorite fonts, so it took away from the experience a little. Still, the story is very enjoyable. I would give it four stars if the font hadn't been an issue."
4,Vintage Poirot,"If you like Christie, and haven't read this one, it's worth it. I hadn't read her for many years now and this reminded me why I liked her so much."
5,Agatha rules!,"I've always loved a good mystery. In fact, I was an Agatha Christie fanatic in junior high and high school. I thought I'd read all of her books. Many (many) years later, I decided to read this Agatha novel given to me as a birthday present, which I somehow had passed over in my youth. I was confident that in my age and wisdom I could surely unwrap any mystery. And I hadn't heard of this novel, so, I thought (rather cockily) that with some thought I could easily unravel it. Boy, was I wrong! I thought I had it figured out (well, I was almost certain it was one of two or three people). But I had no idea who it was till the very end, literally the last few pages. And, in retrospect, it made perfect sense. All I could feel in my duped state was respect for the mind of Agatha Christie; she cleanly fooled me. Needless to say, I highly recommend this tightly-wrapped hidden treasure. . ."
5,one of the best Poirot book,"I cannot really explain why, but for me this is one of the best Poirot book. As usual, expect very intricate plot, memorable characters, and a lot of humour."
2,BORING,"I don't understand all the 5-star reviews for this book. The writing is dated, the plot contrived, the killer unbelievable. The story takes place at Christmas but that is the only Christmas-y thing about it. I generally like AC, but this story seems forced. I wonder if it was written at the same time as The Mousetrap, since the plot is so similar. I did not enjoy it and felt cheated by the ending. I used to own a book of Poirot Christmas short stories that was very enjoyable, and I was looking forward to more of the same. No such luck!"
3,Not her usual!,Just feel that this rates an okay on my book list. Not one of her most exciting and it felt that she was just at the beginning of her literary journey.
5,Agatha Christy,No one does it quite like the English!! I always enjoy Poirot's antics. He is sooo professional and always gets his man (or woman). A fun read.
5,Hercule Poirot's Christmas,This is one of my favorite Hercule Poirot mysteries of all time. I loved it and could not put my kindle down until the end.
4,AN INTERESTING PLOT!!,"Although this book does not compare to Agatha Christie's more famous ones such as ""Murder of Roger Ackroyd"", ""A.B.C. Murders"" and ""The Man in Brown Suit"", however the plot in this book is definitely intriguing. The murder is quite an orthodox one. A tyrannical and wealthy old man is murdered whilst all his family had gathered for Christmas at his invitation. It appears to be a case of murder for monetary benefits by one of the family members. Almost all have a motive and a possible chance to kill the old man. Yet, the end is quite interesting. I found the story so exciting that I finished it in one go."
4,pleasant mystery read,If you like Poirot this book will be a pleasant read.A maybe too short but quick read.I liked it.
5,Cool!,"I bought this not even noticing it was titled, ""GIANT Rider-Waite Tarot Deck"". Giant it is... lol Still a great product and arrived in good time..."
3,too big,"i didn't really read the discription, so when they arrived, i wasa little dissapointed. for me, these cards are a little cumbersomeand hard to handle. they are however, a great learning toolwhereas they are easy to look at, i am a beginer, what i've been doingis picking a different card each day to learn, these cards are great for that."
3,"""Giant"" Rider-Waite Tarot Cards Normal Size","I assumed these cards would be larger. I was disappointed when they arrived to discover they are just the average Tarot deck. Why call them ""giant'?"
2,"very basic, typical ""cookie cutter tarot""","This is the very basic tarot deck that most everyone starts with. I find this deck to be quite dull and boring compared with many of the other more beautiful, artistic tarot decks out there."
5,The Tarot to Buy,"If you're going to buy a tarot, this is the one to get--it's my favorite anyway.The Rider Waite Tarot is the most popular deck out there. Why? because it uses traditional symbols that are easiest to learn.And if you like a larger version of the normal Rider Waite, where you don't need to use a magnifying glass to see the details, then this is the one to get."
3,Good cards for novice study,"These Tarot cards are very big. That is good if you are still studying the imagery of each card in order to become familiar with them. However, practical use of such large cards is cumbersome. They are difficult to shuffle and to handle. I would recommend this deck as a learning tool only."
5,Great Deck.,"This deck is very beautiful, and is a great one to start with tarot. I've read several clients before, and they enjoy them very much, almost as much as I. Shuffling these are rather easy, all you have to do is shuffle with the longer width of the cards. It is a good deck to read, because of their obvious size. Many people cannot see how big these are online, they are very large, even if you're expecting their size they will seem larger than you thought when you get them. The rider waite also has very minimal christian junk in it and only tarot readers MIGHT, mind, to the customer they are still very good."
1,Something's wrong with this listing,"Item is listed as a five-pack of 2x DVD-R media, but the product photo shows that the package is clearly labeled ""1-4x."" They are not the same thing. Some computer drives for burning DVD-R media are apparently only capable of burning 2x discs at the 2x speed; discs rated higher are burned at 1x speed."
4,works good,Quadra fire free standing woodstove replacement fan moves the air well and runs quietly . Was easy to hook up.
4,It blows,Works well on my Quadra-fire wood stove-- it makes a difference in getting more of the house warm. However it is a bit noisy on the high setting. Overall very pleased with this purchase!
4,Nice book,More information than I will ever need. It's a large book with great information. I used as a resource for college mammalogy class. My professor recommended it as one of the best mammal resources out there.
1,A GRADE SCHOOL REFERENCE BOOK,This book is a huge disappointment. It's not woth $10.00. I found better at the books a million discount section. Anyone that would pay $298.00 for this book is not right in the head. Approx 270 pages of 3rd grade text book material.
4,good item for the price,I purchased this for my daughter's room. It looks great and is a bit bigger than I expected (which is fine for me).
3,Got what I paid for.,"The rug was a great price, and it shipped to my house quickly. It is, however not the best of quality, but considering the price, I got what I paid for."
1,Extremly Disappointed in the Zebra Print Rug,"I have ordered numerous amount of items from Amazon; however, this is the worst product that I have ever ordered from Amazon. It is dingy(not white)and also came soiled. Very disappointed!"
3,Meh.,"My bedroom is purple and zebra print.This is a medium sized area rug that is something between off-white and yellow instead of white. It's stiff, thin, and my dog likes it more than I do.It's not bad for the price, but I wouldn't buy it again."
1,"nice idea, not so great of a product","unrolled the product it had a snag running the whole length of it, thus making it a waste of time."
4,Would like all five on DVD,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie except for two things. Now that Matt is done with the law why didn't he go after Kitty and marry her or something. The other being the length of Matt's hair, they finally cut it in the other movies. We see that Matt hasn't changed much except his clothing and residence, his values are still the same and he's as tough and resourceful as ever."
5,FANTASTIC!!!!,Charles Correll directed a stupendous flick!My favorite! All characters were superb. Mandac was a character who was extremely memorable. I watch this dozens of times and always see something new. Hats off to a brilliant movie and a brilliant director!!
5,LIFE SUPPORT is a MUST read for all nurses!,"Having been an RN for almost 30 years, there have been many times when my colleages and I have said, ""We otta write a book! But then reality sets in as we have realized that noone would BELIEVE what we had to say about the health care system and our roles in particular.Bravo to Suzanne Gordon! She tells it like it is with the insight of someone who has been in the trenches and does not suffer from ""tunnel vision!"" My practice has been validated and the reading of her words was a shot in the arm!Nurses and those who live with, know and love them NEED to read this book and reread it. Pass it on or better yet buy them for your friends and family keeping your own copy for the future.This is a view of the reality of nursing, who we are and what we do, where we fit into the larger health care picture and what the health care system is trying to do to us.""It takes a NURSE to save your life.""Marilyn Anne Blythe, RN, CBC Brigham &amp; Women's HospitalBoston, M"
3,Great Nursing Book- could do w/o political commentary,"I really liked the aspects of this books that dealt with the three nurses performing their jobs in their perspective fields. That was great- but all the talk about nursing jobs getting cut really gets boring after a while. So much so I've been dreading reading the last chapter. Great book, just has some boring parts."
5,A visual feast!,"I got this book on a whim, not knowing much about what patterns I'd find within. When it arrived in the mail, I pored over all the beautiful things inside and then brought it to my knitting class that night. My knitting friends are all jealous and have found patterns they want to make too - but the work is pretty advanced. There are some lovely color patterns, some cable ones - just gorgeous - but not for the faint of heart. I like that there are some for children as well. The photos are stunningly beautiful and I know I'll get a lot of use out of this book."
3,an enviro flick,"This movie has an environmnetal message. Green activists may love it. It may seem dated as it deals with bald eagles, a species no longer considered endangered.I bought this to see Powers Boothe's downstairs. You really don't get to see side with the cool curviture. He doesn't have his classic mustache either.This movie stars the guy who played the android who wouldn't die in ""Blade Runner."" If you think that guy is scary in chase scenes, then you'll like seeing him be scary here too. He often wears futuristic clothing, even though this is set in modern times.I thought the child in this film was annoying, but some say working as a child actor is difficult.Was I blown away by this film? No. But did I enjoy it enough not to turn it off? Yes. You may enjoy this decent enough film."
2,"only good song is ""total eclipse of the heart""","the only song worth listening to is total eclipse of the heart. bought this after watching old school. it is however worth buying just for that song. upload it to your computer, then delete every other song."
5,"China Clipper, Martin 130","Thank you for this historically accurate protrayal of the airplane, the Martin 130; and the organization ( Pan American Airways ) that opened the Pacific to international aviation! Stan Cohen's great book is an amazing historic achievement!"
4,Great Product,"I use this on top of my sunscreen and it seems to blend well. I use it as my daily wear makeup because the coverage is great and very light. I have medium skin so i will go a shade lighter next time. Unless you are tan, i would go with a lighter color."
1,Poor craftmanship,"I bought the Bachmann Prairie Locomotive expecting the normal Bachmann quality. One of the drive rods came detached from the wheel within two days of running it. I sent it back, and Bachmann sent another very quickly, so that's a plus. The second engine did fine for a few days, then one of the drive wheels detached. There is no way to re-attach it. I'm about to send it back, so we'll see how the third one does...Hopefully, I was just unlucky."
3,When are you going to ship this book?,"If you ever get around to shipping me this book, I will gladly review it."
5,JVC DVD-RW may be the best brand.,"My new Toshiba DVD recorder (model # D-R4SU )had difficulty recording on DVD-RW on Fuji brand. The Toshiba people I called said that most brands had many defective DVD-RW discs in a typical package. They highly recommended JVC. Their discs are great---no problems at all. I'm sticking with JVC, even though I have to order them from So. Calif. online."
2,Smart Ass my a**,"I was really looking forward to this game. A trivia game that is NOT Trivial Pursuit and has a ridiculous donkey on the cover? Sold.However, playing this game is a different story. If you're even remotely intelligent, this game maybe will last you 20 minutes. The questions are incredibly easy for an adult - which makes me think that it's aimed at drunk people.I'm not sure what's going on with trivia games these days, but it seems that they're collectively lowering the bar to the lowest common denominator. Sorry University Games, you're not living up to your name.If you're looking for a challenging trivia game, this is not the game for you."
5,FUN FUN FUN,"I bought this for my 12yr old, and besides having to set aside some cards because they are things he has never heard of, it is a blast to play. Quick game, takes maybe 20-30 min at the most. We end up playing 3 times in a row to see who really is the Smart A@@!! I recommend it for anyone with middle school age kids, may be to hard for younger kids, and as an adult I find it amazing at the things I do not know! If you like playing games with the kids, and like playing quick games rather then being stuck for hours playing, this is it! There are enough cards as well that the 20 times we have played, we have not gone through them all yet! There are a few cards that would not be child appropriate, like there is one in there that the answer is Viagra, and the clues are more adult then what I would have thought, but other then that we love it!"
2,Not at all challenging for adults,This trivia game is much too easy for adults (anyone 15 or older). You will exhaust all of the questions in 2 or 3 games as well. Not a good value on both counts.
3,"Good, not great","Premise is clear, and game can be easily played within minutes of opening. Unfortunately, as with many trivia games, the amount of questions are not sufficient (repeating allowing previous players an advantage). Also too few ""smart ass"" questions. The player pieces are also not very durable (bent/crushed easily)."
5,easy fun,"Played this with me, hubby and his parents. Dad isn't too patient learning new boardgames, and he is usually not too excited to play them. This was extremely easy to learn and easy to play! Great fun! We played four times in a row. Dad was the one who wanted to keep playing! Only negative is once you go through the cards, you're done. I sure hope they make some more cards, a refill pack."
4,"Fast, Quick Game","This game is great for ice-breakers and playing with a rowdy group. We found the biggest draw to this game was the fact that you don't have to wait your turn, you're constantly moving back and forth on the game board, and between players. It's very quick and fast-paced, fun for nearly anybody (including my non-participating Uncle who couldn't help shouting in some answers from the next room over, even though he ""didn't want to play""). Fun for all!"
3,not for 2 players!!!!,"I have been super excited to play my 2 new board games I purchased online. I also bought Name 5 Game. My boyfriend and I want something fun to do on the rainy Seattle days.However, both games were a disappointment for us. They are NOT for 2 players!!!! Both state they are, but Name 5 Game cannot be played at all with 2 players and Smart Ass is just lame with 2 players.I am hoping to enjoy these games with friends."
2,It Was Alright.....,The board game was just alright. We finished the game in less than 20 minutes. Some of the cards were too easy. I regret buying it.
5,Worth the money and the time,"The game helps you to remember and get an answer. Moves quicker than most trivia games. Could not find this for a Christmas present as everyone was sold out, tell you anything. Would recommend this definitely. This was a gift that I purchased, so now am going to get one for us. This game is fun for most all ages (probably 16 and older ). You do not have to be a brain in order to play and even if you have a memory that is getting older you can play."
4,Really fast paced and comical!,"I've only played two rounds of the game so far but it was a blast! I love how everyone gets to play on all turns. Even though we encountered a few items where no one knew the answer, the youngest player (age 14) still enjoyed the game. Some players did struggle a bit with reading words and the game is occasionally prone to debates on whether or not a response was correct. Overall, I enjoyed the game and am excited to play it again!"
3,Fun the first few times,"After the first few games, you know all the answers and cant play anymore. It was fun while it lasted! Cards are slippery and slide on the floor all the time!"
2,Nothing spectacular.,"This game to me is only alright. The questions are fun, but the game board is poorly laid out with what seems to be not much thought. There will be times when it is beneficial to not answer an answer correctly because of the ""dumbass"" or ""move back 3 spaces"" spots on the board."
2,Not so smart ass,"Three of us ranging in age from 33 to 65 played ""Smart Ass"" last night. We all felt the game was much too easy and lacked excitement. The ""games"" were over in about 15 minutes, and there was little doubt as to who would win. We'll try playing with more people, but we are also going to create some cards of our own to make the game more challenging.I don't know what happens once you have run through the cards. There are only three card categories, so you'll run through them very quickly.The game was a huge disappointment after all the glowing reviews. [...]"
3,Not overly creative but fun,A board game that could become boring... Good cards maybe too much effort is spent on using the word ass
3,game not as stimulating as i had hoped,"i enjoy trivia and was hoping this would be a fun game for my trivia friends, but it's not very fulfilling. It's fine, but there are several i prefer ahead of it."
1,Not for Trivial Pursuit fans,"We got this game for Christmas and played it in our hotel room. What a waste. Definitely not for just two people to play, and especially not if you have just about every Trivial Pursuit game made. It might be a good drinking game for college students, but I would say that the questions are probably best suited for 5th to 8th grade. We were very disappointed."
2,Fun for KIDS - NOT challenging for adults,The educational level for this game is probably about a 3rd or 4th grader. Adults finish it in about 10 minutes.
4,Don't judge a game by its title,"Smart ""Alec"", as we have dubbed it in light of the fact that there are kids around us, is actually pretty fun. It is a trivia game that allows you more than one clue. This game is great for the trivia game player that needs more clues to guess the word.Smart A-- has a box of cards and each card has ten clues on it that go from very vague to very specific. As the reader reads the clues everyone else tries to guess the word being described. Don't jump the gun though because you only get ONE guess! A clue may start out as: ""a place in the northern hemisphere"" and get down to ""an island near San Francisco"" with all the clues in between helping to describe the word.It was very fun, and with the different categories it kept the game fresh. If they could only change the title."
5,British oriented,"I'm surprised that no one has mentioned that this game was developed in England and many of the questions have to do with England and are written from a British point of view. That's not a criticism, nor does it make the game any less fun, but it's a fact. The game is a creative version of a Twenty Questions type trivia game and we had a blast playing it for FIVE HOURS straight."
3,Are you smarter than...........,"This game can be played quickly. When I played with 2 other adults (all of us in our 50's), we felt that some of the questions were poorly written (they start in first person ""I"" and then go to third person, ""it"") and that some had strange context (do kids age 12 really have to be asked, ""What am I"" and have the answer be ""condom""?). Maybe we're a bit too conservative but none of us felt that we'd like to play the game with a 12 year old and have the ""condom question"" be asked!"
3,The questions are really easy.,"I bought this game for my cousin for Xmas. So, we tried it out a couple days later. we got almost all of the questions in only 2 clues, including the ""Hard Ass"" questions. We are a rather bright family, but seriously these questions were so easy that the game wasn't much fun."
3,Surprised by great reviews.,"We've only played this once, so maybe it's not fair to rate yet. There were four of us, young 40-somethings. It was kind of boring. The trivia was relatively easy, so it didn't have the aspect of harder games when you actually feel smart getting something right. I can't exactly put my finger on it, but we just didn't think it was very fun!"
3,fun with alot of players,"This game is fun, probably best for an older crowd who are knowledgeable about landmarks and prominent people of present and past."
2,Ummm...,"I should have played this game before I bought it. I definitely would not have purchased it. The board is too short...right when you start to maybe get into it the game ends. Unfortunately, the rules are so banal, you don't really want to play again. At least on the board. It's more fun just to use the cards and make up your own rules...which we did."
4,I like it but I don't let my kids play,"It's a great adult game. My kids are too young and just would not be able to anwser any of the questions as well as get over the names on the boeard itself. If you have teens or adults to play with, I would say go for it!"
4,Excellent game but low replay value.,"This is an extremely fun and competitive trivia game. It is good for a lot of laughs and is easy to play while also promoting hardcore competition. The first several times you play this it is pretty much the perfect party/trivia game, but it gets old fast. The replay value is low. It's fine if you are replaying it with the same people, but what happens when you want to play it with a different set of friends? Suppose you have played the game three or four times, and now you are playing with someone who has never played it before. You know the answers to most of the cards already, but your friend has never even heard the questions before. That's just not a very level playing field. This game would be better if you could buy more cards in expansion packs."
5,I was the Smart Ass,"I played this game with my daughters and I totally kicked butt. I was the Smart Ass of the night. We really like this game because it ask questions that you know and some that you may have no clue about. I like that you have several clues to help you, and the clues get more detailed as you reach the end of the card. I would suggest this game to anyone who likes being a Smart Ass, I sure like being the Smart Ass of the night... Join Me!!! Have fun:)"
4,Overall Good Game,This game is a good game to add to your collection for game nights. The game is challenging yet has some aspect of chance for those who might not know the questions. Overall I would recommend this game.
4,Fun and Educational,"This is a great game to learn lots of things about many different subjects. It has a fun element to it, but mostly educational."
4,Good fun,This game is good fun. We played it around two hours when we opened it Christmas morning. I anticipate that we will play it a lot in the future.
3,Makes us fell like dumb a**es rather than smart a**es. LOL.,"This game is harder than we thought it would be. Usually when we play trivia games, someone is always yelling out the answer. But, with this games, everybody is stumped. In the games defense, we've only played it once. But, we will try again."
1,misleading,"If you are looking for a game for a bunch of smart-alecky people to play, don't bother with this one. The title is very misleading. It's nothing more than your average trivia game. It was a total waste of my money."
4,My introduction to a new Dutch master,"This was my first Dekok mystery, but I was never confused by the characters or their ""unspoken history"". However, it was evident throughout that the author was very comfortable in the character's skin. The novel read like an old friend, well plotted, quick moving, and yet not revealing itself until the last page. From this introduction, I look forward to reading more of the adventures of Dekok and his partner Vledder."
2,Too Wimped Out for Comfort,"Danny Kirwan did a great job in the early Fleetwood Mac. He gave a kind of melodic edge to the raw blues genius of Peter Green. The combination just worked fine, a sort of Lennon-McCartney relationship combining sophisticated musical smoothness with sarcastic bite. On his own though, Kirwan, just wimps out. Though the compositions on this album all have some merit, they'd better be performed as a backdrop to some soppy Hollywood C-grade love story. Sorry folks, I just can't fathom how the other reviewers of this record awarded it five stars - they must be adherents to the later, watered-down American version of Fleetwood Mac, not the raunchy old British one. Not that I don't listen to this album - I do put in on occasionally at night to fall asleep. It always does the trick, pleasantly."
3,Wrong album,"This is the wrong album to be put on CD. Danny Kirwain was the best guitarist that Fleetwood Mac had. He played guitar like he loved the instrument. His other solo venture entitled ""Hello There Big Boy"" with songs like ""Wings of a Dove"", ""Only You"", and ""Spaceman"" were much more interesting and should be on this CD instead of these songs."
4,Funny,"Birthdays can be HARD when you're not the birthday child. Frances realistically is upset that her baby sister gets cake and presents and SHE DOES NOT. So she eats her sister's present. Whoops.There's a moral in here, though a bit of an inexpressible one, and there's a lot of realism. What more can you ask for?"
5,LOVE the Frances books!,"The Frances books have been a favorite of mine since I was little, but as a child I never realized how well written and witty all the books are. My 2 year hold daughter loves the books and asks for Frances every night!"
5,A timeless piece of gold,"Published 20 years ago, this book's advice couldn't be more superbly useful today. In fact, over the past 20 years, the polluting tripe that we are fed in terms of advertising became even worse, and so Hawken's call for refreshingly honest, clear and crisp communication with the customer (not consumer) which makes a business stand out from the crowd is more relevant than ever.The book cuts through the regular business cliches and hogwash, and gives you sound advice for organically growing a business in which you, your employees and your customers are as satisfied and fulfilled as possible. Highly recommended."
3,Growing A Business,Easy to read and enjoyable. Not very helpful as far as how to grow a business. Worth the money I paid.
5,#1 Resource,"I have owned a my business for 20 years and this book has been my invaluable resource for the majority of that time. Paul Hawken is a very realistic and natural businessman and he is able to communicate his ideas in an easy, by example format that addresses many of the problems and situations the small business owner will face over the years.You will take something new away from this book every time you read it."
4,"great, but non-standard batteries","I found this to be bright enough for me to read without disturbing my bedmate. It's a soft light (almost seems like a natural spectrum) and is very directed at the page. The clip is large enough for even a thick hardcover, and the neck is flexible as needed. So, functionally, it gets a solid A.But I wasn't happy that it takes nonstandard batteries (two of those round watch/calculator batteries). Replacing them is a hassle (though inexpensive) because I have to make a special shopping trip noting the exact type of battery before I leave, and I have to find them in a store with an electronic department. I wish this light took AAA or something.The light does include batteries, so you won't need to worry until you run out. For me, that was probably around 20 hours or so."
2,Dissapointing,"A late night reader, I bought this light so I could read without distubing my husband in bed. I was terribly dissapointed. The light is so dim, and the way the casing is made, makes the light bright in some places and very dim in others. While it's rather nice not to be blinded by the light you're trying to read with, I found I had to hold the book light and trace what I was reading line by line. I was hoping for a hands-free light, but this one was so difficult to use and simply not woth the money I spent on it. I ended up purchasing a head lamp, and that works worlds better."
2,Disappointed,"Despite the snazzy bendable neck, strong gripping clip, and generally good styling, this light suffers from some sub-standard manufacturing. Primarily, the on/off switch does not work as it should, and despite clicking it to the on position the light only engages when I press down on the switch, when it lights sporadically. The battery casing does not close very well, and the whole head of the light is very flimsy, with about the solidity of a kinder egg toy.Also, the battery that came with the light had almost entirely run out before I even got to try it, so I can't really comment on the quality of the illumination. I'm sending it back!"
4,Zelco Rubberneck Clip Light,"Very nice and handy product, I whish the light was little bit more and brighter."
2,Zelco Rubberneck Clip Light,"Difficult to turn on. You squeeze the ""light"", and it takes quite a squeeze in just the right place. Probably OK for a man, but I would not buy it again."
5,Durable,I was going to buy a Disney booklight for my 3 year old but I'm glad I bought this one instead. It is easy enough for him to turn it off himself at night.
3,Contract Tech.,The zelco rubberneck clip looked very nice. We needed a larger lamp and this one did not work for us at this time.
3,Small show with good superfights,"First of all, it's not as violent as you might think. Headbutting is the main difference from what you are used to seeing in the US. No KOs or injuries occur with headbutts in this DVD. Just some cuts but no worse then cuts due to elbows in the UFC.Second, The superfights are very good. Big names in their earlier days. Chuck has a great war with Pele!Third, the only reason I don't give this a high rating is that many of the regular fights are average at best. The production values are low (think KOTC) and WARNING: there is no English, the DVD is all in Potugese (no big deal, I don't care what the commentators day)."
3,Why do you Guys give away the Results ??,"It is nothing short of being viscious, to review a DVD and give out the results of the fights. Who wants to buy an MMA event when they know who the winners are?Liddell vs Pele was Awesome - that was in IVC 6. However, that was not a tournament - unlike all the other IVC's and it was only 3 fights so I was dissappointed overall.IVC 7 was a tournament, and although it did not reach the same intensity as earlier events, I would still recommend it."
4,VTC...Liddell & Silva,"Never knew Chuck competed in VTC in 1998. VTC, (Vale Tudo Championship) in Brazil. Bare knuckle & brutal. (They only pause the fight to wipe the blood off so the fighters can continue)! Pure guts. I bet that's when Chuck wanted a piece of Wanderlie way back then. I gave this 4 stars because it's enduring, but interesting. I would recommend this DVD to true MMA fans as part of a collector's item."
5,Beny Hill comedy,This gentleman was one of the funniest men to ever perform. I followed his show when it was televised and consider my self fortunate to purchase the dvds.
5,Benny Hill Mega set,This is the best set any benny hill fan can have hours and hours of funny sketches and songs
3,Gary Hoyt,"A well done production except the words (audio) are very hard, sometimes impossible to understand. There is no provision for closed captioning."
3,Enter the clown,"Benny Hill is a master of the bawdy, burlesque gag: ""Oye, ya don't get many of those to a pound!"" His mocking innocence and mastery of the double entendre (as the Pythons would say: ""nudge, nudge, wink, wink"") make this collection of Benny's shows a must have for anyone who appreciates Hill's contribution to the development of humor in Britain and around the world.The special features reveal an interesting person behind the clown mask. His ""Biography"" episode provides an insight into the life of a person dedicated to his craft at the cost of all else."
5,Benny Hill: The complete & Unadulterated Megaset,I remember watching this series on PBS and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. This complete set brings back great memories of the fun and joy of Brit Humour as only Benny Hill could do.the one item that really sets this set apart from any other offering is teh A&E; Biography of Benny Hill - A must-watch selection.
2,Another Overrated,"I think that this is really funny but in a kind of a more innocent way. When I was a kid it seems so ""Bad""."
5,Benny at his best,first off product delivered on time which is good....What can i say this collection is wonderful video quality isn't HD but is still great if you like benny hill you'll love thisBenny Hill: The Complete & Unadulterated Megaset (1969-1989)
5,Wonderful British Humor!,"Benny Hill was definitely the King of British Comedy of his time and without question, must have inspired the Monty Python group. His self-deprecating and impish style can be compared to no one else. Some people might consider him sexist, but he was actually pointing fun at the male of the species who first goes after the woman, but ends up being very unhappily chased by her, instead. The films present a wonderful time trip to an era of wide lapels, wide ties, bell bottom trousers, short mini skirts and long boots on a bevy of lovely young ladies. A very enjoyable burlesque romp through the past! My wife and I both love it!"
5,Great fun!,This is a wonderful collection of the best work of one of TV's funniest. The set is a great source of entertainment and a lot of laughter. I'd recommend it to any Benny Hill fan.Sherlock Holmes and the Flying Zombie Death Monkeys
5,King Benny.,"Ah, the great Benny Hill ! The one who uses intelligence to use only suggestion, implication & awareness to produce what is perhaps the best comedy of our generation. All of it without gratuitous heavy language and/or visual nsstiness ( compare Benny with, say, today's ugly Chris Rock et al who get grins & laffs through the worst of the worst lingo ).This undescribably talented, gracious man is no longer among us, but he will be - & is - missed in an unprecedented way!This wonderful man & his truly humorous antics will not be matched I think !!So long Benny ! You gave us so much to laugh about sir ..... all of us !!"
3,Send it East to a western address?,"The first thing I ordered online for Christmas, and the last recieved AFTER christmas. I was surprised on the tracking when the company sent the package to the east coast first, rather then sending it directly west to the address given. It is this sort of round about postage that makes me question the online system.However, all the other things I orderd online came in a timely fashion before Christmas. The packaging was fine and the contents were fine, better then play dough. Just need a little work on their mailing."
5,Outdoors,Just what I wanted in a rugged outdoor hat. Protection from the sun at all angles! Hooray for Tilley.
2,There is a big flaw with the chopper attachment,"We are happy with this attachment. It does its job pretty well, i.e. chopping up and acting like a food processor. But, the top cover is not designed right. Water gets into it after you wash it. And there is no way for the water to come out. My husband now made two holes on the cover so that the water is not withheld inside any more. If not, the old, dirty water sips out gradually and may come out to the new food in your next blending process! Yuk! I'm surprised that the manufacturer didn't think about this problem when designing this product! The blender on its own is just great. But, this chopper attachment has this big flaw."
2,very basic info,this book is just the same old stuff we all know. I was hoping to get some new beauty tips and info. this was dissapointing.
4,fun easy for young girls of all ages,I bought this for my 12 yr old daughter and she loves it she has tried several recommendations from the book for acne and other beauty issues and find them fun easy and quick to do it makes her feel prettier outside as she feels inside
4,Joy of Pickling,"Excellent resource for anyone new or already knowledgeable about pickling. All recipes are well written with some being as quick as 20 min. to others requiring an hour or so, depending on preparation."
2,"I really wanted to like this book, but....","I bought this last year & didn't get a huge chance to use it since our cucumbers didn't do too well. There's a huge assortment of recipes that look worth trying.This year with our overflowing yield of cukes, I decide to try some recipes. Admittedly I've tried only six recipes.....but, here's where I have a problem. The yields and volumes are way off on all of the ones I tried. There was one recipe that showed a yield of 7 pints...it actually yielded 6 quarts! This is a problem with the ratio of salt, spices, etc., being off when the pickles are complete. When pickling and canning, I don't want to have to guess whether it needs more salt in order to brine properly (and they didn't)....I'm comfortable being a bit of this-n-that cook for dinners, but not for canning."
2,I sent it back,"When I read the recipe for pickled beaver tail, I knew this collection was out of my league. There are so many great books on this subject that are more engaging and more inspiring - that this one deserves to age right where it is before commanding space on your pantry book shelf. I was so captivated by Mary Dragan's Well Preserved that I can't help suggesting it here as a better alternative. If you want recipes for chutneys, preserves and much better pickles that's where you'll find them."
3,Am I ready for digital books?,"I was excited about this new media format thinking I could use images for a screen saver or look at more detail, zoom in; but i was a bit diasppointed. This is better than the Morphosis one I also bought at the same time but many of the images are of limited size and i was hoping they could be viewed on a large format flat screen. Navigation takes a bit of getting used to. I still have a hard time reading content for long periods on the screen. For the price i think this should have been edited as a DVD video/documentray interview for viewing on a TV. It seems this format is stuck between CD and DVD, not a very satisfying experience. I think it should play itself with a commentary than having the user click through the various obscure tabs. There are alot of drawings and renderings that may not be available elseware; Hadid's work is hard to picture, visiting the real building is still the only way to really understand them."
2,BP Medical Supplies needs better customer service,"The specimen cups are fine, it's just BP Medical I have to complain about. I wanted to get FedEx service overnight, but this was not an option when ordering, so I sent an e-mail to BP Medical asking if they could expedite the shipping. No response... So the next day I looked up their phone number and gave them a call. It was a cell phone, not an office phone, and nobody answered. So I left an urgent voicemail asking them to contact me immediately about my order. Still no response... Then I again sent them another e-mail asking for anyone to return my message about when I would get my shipment. By then I was ready to order from another company and pay more money just so I could know when I would get my shipment. Still no response, but the next day the package arrived. How hard is it to send a reply back on e-mail??Buyer beware..."
3,Not entirely air tight.,"I actually used these for ceramic glaze, not urine. After about 4 months the glazes were dried out. They don't leak and they're probably excellent for specimen collection, but don't count on them for long term storage of anything."
3,Very Good True Crime,"This wasn't your typical true crime novel. It was well-written and not exceedingly repetitive as many true crime novels are, repeating all the facts over and over again throughout the telling of the story. The fact that this was a murder case involving 6 typical teens, yet atypical teens, makes it all the more interesting. This book was hard to put down and unlike many novels, it seems that the murderers get for the most part, what they deserve."
1,An old and very used book!,The book was in poor condition with worn yellowing and tattered pages. It was offered as used but GOOD condition. I guess someone at Amazon is not clear about what GOOD condition should look like. I skieved it and could not read it....I sprayed it with disinfectant and will try again another daY!
3,"this book is about my cousin, his picture is on the cover",i didnt get to read it yet. i actually found out about this book from my grandma today. my family never told me what happened when my cousin (James Wanger) stop showing up at family events. now i found out y. im about to read it and see how true it is. pretty crazy.
4,"Professional, succinct, true crime","The best part of this book is the author's description of southeast Passaic County, New Jersey, where the action almost exclusively takes place. Clifton, Paterson, and the industrial Passaic River valley are evoked quite well, especially the area's weird mix of industrial might, industrial blight, and lower- to middle-middle-class residential. The kids are the same dumb (but the author unconvincingly claims throughout the book that most of them are smart), wasted youth described in so many true crime books lately (e.g., Bully, Smoked), with an ethnic twist. All you need to know about a crime that was sensational back in the early 1990s but is probably forgotten now, even in northern New Jersey."
5,Lo Mejor de David Bisbal,"Me fascino es lo mejor que a hecho David Bisbal sacar este DVD y CD con sus mejores canciones y que mejor ver un concierto de el en vivo, por cierto que canta y baila excelente un gran cantante, desde sus inicios de ""ave maria"" y despues con ""buleria"" pues a logrado ganarse el cari√±o del publico y ahora con la cancion que incluye en su reciente disco "" todo por ustedes"" pues la verdad que te puedo decir un super exitaso asi que David Bisbal sigue para adelante y siguenos regalando canciones como lo has hecho hasta ahora, MUCHA SUERTE."
3,Becareful!!!,"The service of purchase was good and fast, but the dvd case was broken, so you should review the item an d contact asap. the amazone site or contact."
1,Horrible Colors!,"I purchased this knowing that it wasn't going to be high quality due to the price. When I opened the charm, the large beads and the ribbons were a very orange/salmon color; where the beads at the top (the little tiny ones) were a nice bright baby pink (the REAL color the ribbon should be). It's a horrible color and looks extremely cheap since none of it matches. I got the charm on the far left of the stock photo, they seem to be tiger eye beads and the colors are just awful. Since the money I spent is not worth the time and effort to return the product I will be throwing it in the trash and cutting my losses."
1,bad quality,"yes, its for cancer funds, but dude its not worth it, better buy a live strong bracelet, poor poor quality."
1,Purse Charm,"Cheap, I lost in with in hours of putting it on my purse,I was very dissappointed. I hope to see some inprovements on these products."
1,Useless,"I bought it five months ago. My small finches never even come close to it. The hole is too small and surrounded by firm sharp sticks so I couldn't put my finger in it without being hurt. I never saw what nests finches have in wild life, but am sure something more comfortable."
4,Happy,"Very nice pendant. Highly polished and as pretty as the picture. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star rating is I feel the picture is deceptive due to the chain shown. While I knew there was no chain included I assumed, wrongly, that the chain shown in the picture was the chain included in the ""gift"" selection during checkout. The chain that comes with this IF you choose it during the checkout is a pretty, but thin, linked chain and isn't really appropriate for the size of this pendant. I would highly recommend that if you need a chain for this item you avoid the gift chain and search for something more substantial. Shipping was fast and painless....I would definitely buy from this company again."
4,Good set,"Pros. Nice, heavy set. Looks very good and elegant.Cons. Spoons too deep, few stains found on a few pieces."
3,Good set of everday flatware,"Very heavy and durable, nice for everyday use, I got it for a great deal but having used I might have paid full price."
1,Incompatible with Droid!,"This did seem like a great unit, so I did purchase one, and paid overnight shipping.After spending an hour trying to get it to pair with my Droid, I called technical support to have them tell me they aren't compatible!If I had known this ahead of time, I would have not lost $[...] in overnight shipping!Very disappointing."
1,Not That Great,"I have had this headset for several years now. I bought it because of many positive reviews and its rating on the Nuance Dragon Hardware Compatibility site.It is not that comfortable to wear and it's accuracy on Dragon Premium is not all that great despite repeated accuracy tuning and regular updates of that product. The batteries have been a problem and don't last that long. One shorted out while recharging in the auxiliary charging port. It rendered the entire headset useless until I was able to track down the problem, which only took several hours. Support documentation on the Sennheiser website is not that great either.If I had it to do all over again, I would definitely not buy one of these. There are better headsets for the same price and even less.The vendor on Amazon who sold me the headset did an excellent job, buy the way of promptly delivering it upon order. Five stars to them, one to Sennheiser."
3,Never a fan of Quiz Books,"I've never been a fan of quiz books, and I also hadn't read all of the Travis McGee books when I stumbled across this, making it a slightly useless purchase for me. However, having now read the entire series, looking back at the quiz book is an amusing diversion. Not a must-have item, unless you're a fanatical fan of the McGee books. But if you are, definitely worth checking out."
3,A Little Narrow in Scope,"If I remember the story right, the author intended to make a different sort of book and was persuaded to keep the topic within a narrow boundary. So, take it as a single track in the investigation and the reader should realize they need to make a personal investigation on this subject. My opinion is that there arose in ancient times a Paul franchise that was just too useful to give up, kind of like how the security/industrial complex of the US uses the Osama Bin Laden franchise to scare people into thinking they need their security even tough the man has been dead since 2002."
1,BUY EJACULOID INSTEAD...,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM TOGETHER WITH EJACULOID....EJACULOID EXCEEDED MY EXPECTATIONS BUT STIMULOID DISSAPOINTED ME...I WOULD GET HORRIBLE HEADACHES WITH IT AND IT WOULD NOT MATTER IF I TOOK IT WITH OR WITHOUT FOOD,I COULD FEEL MY HEART GO FASTER AND I WOULD FEEL..""ANGER""..?"
4,Nice thumbnail history of the Cowboys,"Chip Lovitt, Dallas Cowboys. Mankato, MN: Creative Education, 1997. HB, 32p., illus. ISBN 0-88682-789-2This children's book reviews the history of football in Dallas beginning with the '52 Texans through the '95 Cowboys.The outstanding feature is the many full-page color illustrations.This book is one in the ""NFL Today"" series.Copyright 1997 by Fred Goodwin"
3,Not that good,This resembles way too much old new wave stalwarts Talking Heads but in a rather unimaginative way.
2,Excited by it at first,"Listening to the first track, I was very excited about this album. It was delightfully quirky and fun. The singer's voice matched what they were doing perfectly. Excellent. Each track thereafter I was more and more irritated with the singer's voice. There is a little voice-break thing he likes to do which, to me is the worst noise he makes but he keeps doing it! A lot! More and more as the album goes on. The MUSIC is good - excellent even. Perhaps if they had a stand in vocalist I would enjoy it. This is coming from a Neutral Milk Hotel fan, so I'm not some guy that requires the vocalist to be a former opera tenor. That said, make your own choice, if you aren't as irritated at the voice as I am, this probably is a great album."
2,"i wanted to clap my hands, but couldn't","i had heard about this band from....i don't know where really. bought the CD and dang it, i want my money back! like another reviewer mentioned, all the elements are there: great music, great name, the ""oh-so-cool"" indie genre...but the singer. he just ruins it for me. i love the music itself, but just when i'm enjoying the music, alec ounsworth opens his mouth and i'm instantly turned off. i don't usually write reviews of music because it's so subjective, but dammit, this guy pisses me off! i know he's actually wanting to sound like that, but his voice ruins what would have otherwise been an awesome band. i vote thumbs down."
2,"overrated, deeply flawed, but not a total waste of time","In recent times I have, like everyone else, become quite a fan of the whole new new wave/post punk/indie/whatever scene with groups such as Bloc Party, Wolf Parade, Maximo Park, Interpol, Death Cab, Arcade Fire, etc etc etc... These guys seemed promising, I like the DIY thing they have and stuff, but they miss the mark IMO. Most of the songs simply go nowhere and, yes, the vocals really are horrible! In one tune he sings ""and I'm a wounded bird..."", quite an apt self-description for my money! He does sound like David Byrne as others have noted, just more nasally and annoying. Having said that, ""over and over again"", ""gimme some salt"", and ""in this home of ice"" are actually pretty good, which is frustrating, it would be easier if I could just write this cd off completely."
4,Pretty Good Band,Pretty good band... not surprised that they're an indie band in todays sad music state..... They sound a lot like a cross between David Byrne and Morrisey.... but still pull it off as an original sound...
2,The guy cannot sing,"There's no denying there is talent here, but oh my gosh, the singing CANNOT carry a tune. His voice cracks regularly. Is the best he can sound in a recording studio? Yikes.David Byrne, who this guys sounds very much like, can sing by the way.Really, before you buy, make sure you can handle the high-pitched and flat singing."
4,worthy of attention,"Only recently did I pick up CYHSY's self-titled album. I must say, I came away very impressed with the music on this album. However, like many others on here have said, the vocals are hard to listen to at times, it's so off-key it makes you think that any schmo could sing in this bad. But, after a few listens through the album I have become hooked on this album. Standout tracks include ""Over and Over Again"", ""Details of the War"" and ""Gimme Some Salt"". The albums closes brilliantly with the final four songs. This is definitely an album you should pick up if you are looking for something new and different."
2,"Uh, yeah....","Aside from having what is possibly the most laughably awful name for a band I've ever heard, these guys just really don't do it for me. A lot of the music is fairly decent, but the singer is just incredibly annoying. Now, I am certainly not a stickler on vocal perfection, but this dude is really bad. I've heard drunk guys in karaoke bars that I'd rather listen to.But like I said, the band overall isn't completely terrible. They're decent musicians, and I like a lot of the music, but I just really cannot get around that singer.Ordinarily, it's not a good idea to judge a band by their name, but um...this isn't one of those times."
5,hanging with your fashionable wars,"I'm not good at reviews, I'll admit. I felt compelled to review this record because 1) it's brilliant and 2) all but my referer find it annoying.I fell in love with this record right away. And it's grown on me more and more. I love it all: the creative use of seemingly out-of-place harmonicas, the jumpy basslines, the shuffling drums, the warm synths, Ounsworth's semi-mumbling Win Butler/Paul Banks/Bob Dylan/whatever-like vocals. Most of the time I have no idea what he's saying, and I love it.The previous reviewer said: ""Clap Your Hands traffics in melodic, exuberant indie rock that pairs the shimmering, wafting feel of Yo La Tengo with a singular vocal presence that sounds like Paul Banks attempting to yodel through Jeff Mangum's throat. Or imagine the Arcade Fire if their music were more fun-loving and less grave."" That's pretty much perfect.You'll probably find the vocals annoying. Ah well, your loss."
5,Finally...,"Finally a very fresh sound group... The voice is kind of disgusting, kind of charming a perfect combination.Listen carefully to all the elements in the songs... is not as simple as it sounds at firs hear."
4,it's about time,"this album has actually been floating around for over a year, while different record labels unsuccessfully tried to sign this amazing talent. They played this summer at the NYC Seaport music festival - although a free concert the turnout was nuts and they played a great show. Great album overall."
5,idiosyncratic pop for fans of weird music,"Did you like the violent femmes? disappointed with their late efforts and longing for another ""blister in the sun""? Well i think this is the closest thing you will ever find. The vocalist sounds kinda like Gordon Gano of the Femmes. Thats the closest comparison i can think of. However, the music expands far beyond the acoustic guitar/brushed drum sound of the Femmes. It adds on layers of synth and electric guitar and other random musical tidbits. The songs are simple little ditties a la early talking heads. I mean, these guys just seemed to find a niche in the current musical scene. They dont sound readily like anything in particular out there....although one could stretch and mention arcade fire, wolf parade, and modest mouse....but only because those bands also make weird idiosyncratic pop music. HOORAH to expanding the boundaries of the 3 minute pop tune. I hope more bands could have this much FUN making a record."
1,awful awful vocals,"I really liked some of the music on this album. That is until I heard the vocals. They were so grating and abrasive that I thought they were joking at first. Three tracks later, I found that they were serious. Seriously trying to rip off David Byrne and the Violent Femmes. Unfortunately, the vocals don't have any of Byrne's genuine quirkiness or the Femmes charisma."
2,OK but not Gods gift.,"Yeah, I'm glad I bought this CD. But I can tell that after the shine has worn away this will go into my CD case to maybe never come out again. It just doesn't seem to be one of those that will stand the test of time. So, I know other people are wetting themselves about how great this CD is but in my opinion, its good.(3 year update- I do still take this one out from time to time and listen to it. Surprisingly it has grown on me and the whiney voice didn't grind on me like I thought it would. If I had to make the decision to buy it again I would.)"
2,"Not that great, really.","OK, I've heard more hype about this album than you can possibly imagine and it seems that everyone and their mom absolutely adores this album. Fine. But that doesn't make this album any good. Sure the songs are kinda catchy, but they are blatantly stolen from the Talking Heads who were playing this kind of music almost thirty years ago. And that's what annoys me most about the hype. It's that everyone thinks this band has a ""fresh, new sound"". It's definitely the kind of music they would (and probably do) play on Indie 103.1, but don't even get me started on those guys. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of current independent music, but these guys just don't cut it for me. Do yourself a big favour and buy 'More Songs About Buildings and Food' or 'Fear of Music' or 'Remain in Light' or even 'Speaking In Tongues'."
1,SO OVERRATED,"The year's most overrated album - BY FAR. It's disgusting how people buy into hype so quickly these days. Early on, Pitchfork (the indie-twerp bible) gave this band a ridiculously glowing review which basically snow-balled into what we're seeing now. The ""old"" media wanted to be hip so they just jumped on the bandwagon without really listening. Let's face it, this band SUCKS. The singer is horribly annoying. The lyrics are for idiots. It's not ""fun"", it's tedious. Strictly for the pretentious, asexual, bitter, Pitchfork crowd."
3,A good David Byrne impersonation,"It's nothing to be ashamed of - a lot of the songs are pretty good and overall none of it is dull. It has good bass playing. Kind of a mix between Joy Division / Hoodoo Gurus / Talking Heads. That's an interesting combination, wouldn't you say? I say: go ahead and pick it up."
1,This is flat out Plagiarism,"Though the songs aren't bad, this is such obvious plagiarism that it hurts and that is why it can only get one star. At times Ounsworth sounds more like David Byrne then the Ol' Heads front man himself. Someone could have put this disc on and said it was lost Talking Heads material and the most hardcore of fans would believe it! It's quite amazing that they are getting away with this. Shameless!!!Do yourself a favor and pick up the first four Talking Heads albums first along with the Violent Femmes debut. That will sum this up and the originals are always better."
3,shake your hair and say ahhhh,mY SISter play this really REALLY(!) loud when she blowdry her hair. One days she will move out and maybe well all get some pace of mind.
1,Worthless,"More whiney, ""intellectual"", indie rock repleate with awful vox?Clap your hands and say 'naw'."
1,It could've been a 5 star album but the VOCALS RUINS the whole thing.,"This album had a lot of hype surrounding it and I was really eager to buy it and listen to the whole thing and finally discover the reason of all this hype.Well, I finally did it and it was a complete dissapointment... Let me explain, the music was actually really good but what really ruins the whole experience is the vocals, they are HORRIBLE I thought that it was a joke at first (when the vocals started at the first song) but no... the voice was the same in all of the songs. HORRIBLE is a pretty word to describe his voice, seriously you should consider hearing a song from this album before you actually buy it.To conclude,This album deserves only 1 star, I would've given 0 if I could. Damn I don't think that there's even a parameter to be considered a vocalist, even if you're an awful singer you can actually have your band and sell some albumsBY THE WAY: DONT BUY IT ONLY BECAUSE PITCHFORK GAVE THIS ONE A 9.0"
1,death to dance rock,"i'm really sick of these David Byrne jocking-Gang of Four rip off bands.I love the talking headsGang of Four are meh, Pere Ubu are lightyears betterbut this trash is just utterly worthless, unless you're a fat scene chick."
1,"So much hype, so much bad music","There was so much hype about this album from pitchfork to other music blogs. Even a friend (who admitedly has bad musical tastes) recommened it to me. So I gave into peer pressure and downloaded it, hoping all the hype would make it a good album. it was god-awful. i subjected my classmates in studio to the music for about half the album with many complaints. I usually like odd, off-beat music. but this was too much for me. the cords clashed and there was no real beat to the music. every song sounded the same."
1,Rediculous,"I ordered this item on Christmas day with the standard 5-7 day shipping. It is January 7th and i just found out that the estimated day i will get it is the 20th of January. It obviously must be a hard to find CD, and I recomend just going and getting it in a store rather than waiting around for 3 weeks."
4,Promising debut,"A really nice rock record. Alec Ounsworth's songwriting is textured and propulsive, his vocals intriguing and beguiling. The ultra-nasal 'David Byrne-meets-Thom Yorke' yowl can be a little off-putting at first, but rewards repeated listens.One major drawback is that the lyrics get a little lazy at times. While listening to Ounsworth snarl out the phrase ""Child Stars"" 30 times in a row ('Upon This Tidal Wave of Young Blood') is a lot easier on the ears that you might expect, one still imagines that he could do a lot better. This sort of phrase repetition is common throughout the album. Still, the lyrics are idealistic, painting a portrait of youth and exuberance that is both infectous and well suited to the musical content of the album--rhythmically dense, bouncy at some times, and overwhelmingly intense at others. With Ounsworth reportedly well underway writing new tunes for a follow-up, there are almost certainly more things in store from Clap Your Hands, Say Yeah."
4,Glad I Listened Before Reading the Reviews,"Got this as a gift, didn't know anything about it. Just listened straight through thru the headphones and I liked it a lot. It's definitely unique. There are comparisons (as everyone has pointed out) between the vocalist and David Byrne, although I hear Gordon Gano more on most of the songs.It's pointless to try to describe the sound, but I had the same feeling listening to this as I did when I brought home the Heads in grade school, the Femmes and VU in highschool and Soul Coughing in college.The lo-fi is cool and I had a great time ticking off the names of all the bands (I probably heard 50) these guys ""borrow liberally from"" as I listened. I mean that in a good way.I doubt I'll be blasting this on the stereo, but it will be in heavy rotation on the ipod."
4,first listen,"actually i still haven't made it all the way through my first listen yet, but this album immediately struck me as a kind of cross between the velvet underground and the talking heads. the rhythm guitars especially remind of the velvets, while the upbeat quality and synth stuff strikes me as talking heads-ish. There's also definitely a david byrne quality to ounsworth's voice (also a little bit of gordon gano)...."
3,Tough critic,"Can't believe I'm taking the time to write an online review. It's a testament to my fondness for this album. I first became aware of this band from the free CD that accompanies the British music mag ""Uncut."" When ""Upon this tidal wave of young blood"" came thru the speakers in my car, my scalp tingled and the hair on my arms stood on end. It was more than just hearing David Byrne reincarnate (can someone be ""reincarnate"" if they're not even dead yet?), this band's SOUND was an auditory revelation. I say ""tough critic"" because I hear some bands and sounds that strike my fancy here and there, but few that moved me the way CYHSY does. And few that instantly and completely renew my HOPE in the future of music. Some bands are like certain movies are for me--I judge people based on whether they ""get it"" when they hear or watch them. I will raise a critical eyebrow indeed at anyone that fails to immediately acknowledge the brilliance of this album. Nuf said."
4,Wow,"Yes, I've read the reviews, yes, I've tried to get friends to listen to this, no, not many people I know personally like this band.But I love them. Can Jeff Mangum sing? Some think no, but I think he can. Alec Ounsworth does this seriously whiney, yowly thing that I can't help but respond to. I've fallen in love with that vocal thing, also loving Wolf Parade for the same reason.There are very few songs on this album that I don't still love with repeated (and I mean repeated) play. Only ones I don't like are the ones where he talk-sings the same damn phrase over and over. But I always like the part of the song that leads up to that, so I can't help but give even those songs 3 out of 5 stars.I dig this band and bought the new album without hearing any other than Love Song No. 7."
5,SPRI TFM-2R Folding 6-Foot by 2-Foot Exercise Mat,"I was looking for a new exercise mat as my old one was starting to hurt my knees when doing donkey kicks, etc. This mat not only is easier on the knees, but for me being 5' 7"" the mat is nice and long and a lot more comfortable to do crunchs and side exercises. Folds up to save a little space and is easy to wipe off after a good floor workout."
5,"Super, Awesome, Comfortable!","It works for what I need. I use it with my daily workouts because I have hardwood floors. Its very thick with very good strong lasting material. I dont even feel the floor with this item. I must say this..if your looking for a compact and store away while not in use..this might not be for you. It only folds one time..with a handle.. I store it in a closet and still takes up space but is flush with the inside wall. Overall, Very good excercise mat.Recommend it highly!"
2,Cushy mat...while it lasts...,"Was using this for P90X, it was good cushioning and the only complaint in the first month was that I should have gotten a longer mat as my 6'1"" height was a bit much for some of the exercises. However, the severe problems with the mat came when the shoddy stitching burst and I was left with a busted mat after about 3 months."
5,Perfect for Stretching - Highly Recommended!,"The SPRI Folding Exercise Mat is exactly what I needed for stretching out before going to TaeKwonDo class. Being middle-aged, the regular class warm up isn't enough for my tight old muscles so extra time spent doing stretching on this mat is an important way to prevent injury. Here are my observations:Pros -+ Large Size; 6' x 2' easily accommodates me for most stretching+ Thick Pad; 1.5"" foam is comfortable and absorbs most of the impact shock from getting up and down+ Flat; since it folds and doesn't roll up, the mat lays perfectly flat+ Easy to Clean; wipes up and doesn't appear to stain+ Easy to Transport; folds to 3' x 2' x 3"" and has attached handlesCons -- Slight Plastic Smell; the vinyl cover has a faint smell that lessens over timeThis was a good choice for my needs and it would likely be good for Yoga and Pilates as well.Highly Recommended!"
3,about packaged Composite application book,"The packaged composite application are the future of business applications. In this Book,Dan Woods, describe the importance of this application's type describing their architecture and some example very useful."
1,marketing,"This book and its sister book on ESA does exactly what the introduction says it won't, it's nothing but marketing material. It is full of consultant doublespeak and absolutely no substance.O'Reilley should be ashamed they published these 2 books."
5,Magnificent & Tremendously Helpful,"After reading this book I am happier, more satisfied, calmer and more focused on what is important in life. Whatever your religion, the ideals put forth in this book will help you in our life outlook and enable you to enjoy what your life is supposed to be about. I owe Christopher Chamberlin Moore a big THANK YOU for writing a book that explains how to be a Human Being and have a positive effect on all mankind around you."
4,where were you in the 90's?,although this does infact sound like something that came out of the 90's it's still done well. If Mad Caddies and the Toadies had a kid this is what it may sound like. I reccomend it to anyone who remembers what good plain music sounds like.
5,"Great one, again","This pairing of two of Fela's best albums is also a must have. Opposite People is one of Fela's most captivating and danceable songs ever recorded. The soloing is absolutely incredible. Sorrow, Tears and Blood is simply one of his best songs overall."
2,Adequate at best . . . .,I was disappointed that the authors did nothing but gloss over the new data warehouse feature of Oracle 8i . Considering who the authors are (both high level Oracle employees) I was hoping for more in depth analysis. This book cover just the basic of what Oracle 8i can really do. Little to no examples make this book more of a theory book than on with practical advice. I would recommend getting a copy of Oracle 8i Data Warehousing Guide. It a pdf file that you need to get from an Oracle Employee. Its harder to get but well worth the effort ! ! ! !
3,Good review of new features,"I found the book to be a good introduction to some of the new features of Oracle 8i. The code examples were particularly interesting (but of more interest to DBAs than developers, and DBAs would probably prefer a more comprehensive book). The book was useful and worth my investment."
3,Blakey,"When G. Robert Blakey wrote this, he had spent a good part of his career trying to bring down organized crime. I can't help but think that his ""the mob killed Kennedy"" HSCA theory was, in the end, his own pure speculation, crafted to help further his agenda. But you have to hand it too him, his Jihad against the mob (through his RICO legislation etc.) worked. I'm just not sure how honest his book is about the Kennedy assassination."
1,"BEWARE, BROTHER, BEWARE","If you're looking for some film on Dick Gregory, don't get this. You will be sorely disappointed. The picture is grainy. It seems to have been done with a home movie camera. The sound is muddy and you miss a lot of Dick Gregory's speech. Somebody ought to be ashamed of themselves for trying to sell this to the public. In the words of Louis Jordan - Beware, Brother, Beware!"
1,An Evening with Dick Gregory,The quality of the DVD was very poor. The audio was poor;it was difficult to understand what Mr. Gregory was saying. The DVD was the work of an amateur.The DVD was a gift to my Father and it was a disappointment.Sonya
3,Good Beginner Tablet,"This is an excellent inexpensive option for beginning digital designers, and digital photo editor. This tablet does not have as much precision as more advanced designers might need, but if you are just starting out, or just on a budget, this is a highly functional choice. I would recommend this to anybody, and have not been unhappy with the overall products achieved with this product. I would say that its range is a little disappointing in that you must keep the pen close to the tablet in order to get truly smooth strokes, but the tip sensitivity is right on. As a result just a little practice will yield better results. But again, overall, this is highly functional for the price and an excellent choice in the end."
1,Waste of $$$,"The Adesso CyberTablet is a waste of money. It is no more than MS Paint, which I already have on my PC. The software is not user friendly, and does not come with a user manual. (I contacted Adesso, they really do not have a user manual for the product - only the useless installation guide) The box that the product came in has crappy graphics, this should have been my first clue. I am giving it to my daughter to play with, it is not for me."
2,Not up to speed with Wacom's products,"I use a Wacom tablet at home, but at work we have the Cyber Tablet since the larger Wacom wasn't in the budget. I think this product would be fine if you're not using it in a work environment, eight plus hours a day. The button on the pen doesn't always work, and I end up having to grab the mouse to right click for my pop-up menus in InDesign and Photoshop. Also when using the pen, it doesn't always release exactly where it should when I'm dragging guides or image/text boxes. All too often I end up usingthe arrow keys to get the placement I need. Fine tuning the tablet's settings hasn't really helped any of that.If you're a graphic artist needing a pen tablet for daily use in a production environment, I'd recommend buying a Wacom tablet instead. These little glitches definitely slow down my productivity. If you want a cheaper tablet for a hobby, this is probably fine."
4,Functions are ok but has technical problems,"Well, I liked how the drawing tablet performs. I believe it performs as I expected it to do. However, there are problems with the driver. I have to reinstall the driver every time I turn on my computer. If I don't install it, I can still use the tablet and mouse but without precision. So, I have to install the driver again and again, which is annoying. I am using Windows XP, but I don't know if this is an isolated case or not."
1,Amazon refuses a zero star review...,"Simple. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This isn't to say that there isn't some good acting in it (there is a little). However, the script is awful, the production is jumbled, and the storyline is inane. If you have two hours (and a few bucks) to waste, help yourself.It's interesting to note that I've heard of people laughing through horror movies before, but had never done so myself before now.I haven't read the book, but being a long time King fan, I imagine the book is good -- but the movie is the pits."
1,We should know by know KING stories don't translate to screen,"We (my wife and I) have finally learned out lesson after all this time.............. Stephen King is a legendary horror writer, but virtually every attempt to bring one of his stories to the screen fails miserably.This is another example.Avoid at all costs...... uggghh.......... boring, silly and BAD !"
2,Stephen King's Desperation (2006)-Very weak screen adaptation.,"Stephen King's Desperation (2006) was a poor two star film adaptation. I was only able to enjoy the first twenty minutes or so of Ron Perlman's work playing a Desperation road cop and then the movie turned to complete ka ka. This film was supposedly a mini ""Stand"", but I didn't see any comparison. It appeared to be a flimsy excuse for showing some very warped screen images that will stay in memory and make the audience never trust a police officer again! The on location scenery was very nice and was scoped out by King himself."
1,hack garris trashes another $tephen king book.,"Everybody's over-acting here. This is more of a horror spoof, than a horror movie.Bad acting, worse dialog and terrible directing. What else would garris deliver?"
5,Stephen King's Desperation,"EXCELLENT PRODUCT And VERY RELIABLE SALESMAN, SINCE IT GIVES IN TIME And IT FORMS"
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"When Stephen King's work started being turned into movies, they were always great, but the newer stuff, has really been hit or miss. For the first hour, Desperation was great and Ron Pearlman was hilarious as the twisted sheriff, abducting people on the highway. Unfortunately, about half way through this film, the movie changes focus to young David, played by the kid from the Stacy's Mom video, Shane Haboucha. David is some kind of prophet who is more aware of things than the other. That was cool, but his constant ramblings about God, and spouting of all this religious bull got really annoying. By the time things built up to the end, I was so annoyed with this little kid and his ramblings that I just didn't care about what was going to happen. I just wanted the film to be over. Desperation is just another case of a writer and an actor taking things too far, to a point where it taints the whole movie."
3,An OK movei,"I bought this movie cause I read the book and really liked it. It was close to the book, but not close enough. I gave it 3 stars because of this. I might have given 4 stars if I hadn't read the book before I watched it."
2,disappointing....,"....here's why: The book itself is excellent- one of King's best books (and I've read many, although not all, of his).the problem is that this was broadcast on network television. King is a ""R"" rated writer- so the version you see on television is a ""watered-down"" version of the book- consequently, what you SEE on screen isn't nearly as scary or horrifying as what you READ in the book.the actors were great- don't blame them. This would have been better if presented on HBO or Showtime where the director doesn't have to edit out so much material.** read the book instead **"
3,Liked the book better,"I am an avid Steven King fan. I usually read the books then watch the movies just to see if I get the same feeling from the them and usually I don't but that is to be expected. I can't say I'm disappointed in the movie because I wasn't. The book was pretty hard to live up to on screen. It pretty much was translated into a saturday evening Sci-Fi Channel movie (no offense to Sci-Fi Channel lovers) I really did think that Ron Pearlman was a good cast for the cop. He was who I had in mind when I read the book. All in all it was ok. Glad I bought it, but not surprised I didn't know it it existed. lol"
3,Good enough,"It's SK and it's Desperation, that's for sure. You can recognize the book (with some good details in the beggining and some bad details in the theatre, etc.), and I love these actors so it's a pretty good deal for me, but you don't have the sensations/feelings you have with the book (it's a movie, what do you expect?), and there are some problems with the story also so if you don't like pretty much SK, this may not be a film for you."
2,A Grace Disguised is much better,I was lead to believe this was a book written about Paula D'Arcy losing her husband and daughter and while there was some mention of that experience I felt the book was more poetry than story and very disjointed. I was asked to read it and though I had read A Grace Disguised already I bought this book and read it. Definitely not something I'll pass on to anyone who is looking for direct and straight forward language.
5,Brilliant!,"Has anyone else in the world read this book? I have read a lotof books, but this has to be one of my favourites. Poor Marigold (orBilge) is so ordinary it's painful. You can really relate to her. This book combines, ordinary (and somewhat monotonous) life, intrigue and romance (Terrapin & Jack- Lucky thing!) Love it! Read it NOW!"
2,"good content, however!","The book contains good and applicable content for basic orbital mechanics. However, it is riddled with annoying typos and errors with no errata to be found. As an expensive textbook one would expect more care."
4,Affordable & Decent Quality,"I also had Aircraft Structural Analysis textbook written by the same author, which was never updated, unreadable & full of errors. I'd say that Mr. Curtis should stay away from Structure because this textbook is a totally different reading experience compared to the previous book I mentioned before.First, it is affordable, it only costs me $45 (I bought mine from third party vendor listed on Amazon Marketplace); second, it is readable & actually has examples that the readers could understand. The only thing that annoyed me a bit is the fact that the a lot of the important formulas are not organized or boxed, so readers have to do it manually with pencil. A few chapters, especially chapter 10 needs to contain more example or expanded further in order to enlighten the audience about the material. Going to lecture might improve the readers' overall experience, so don't use the book as self study because the vast amount of mathematical derivations could be discouraging."
1,deceiving,"Kindle version is the first edition to this book, not the second edition. All the problems are different between the two editions. Useless in my class. Had to return and order the textbook."
1,Disappointed,"I was planning on using this to go camping on the weekend of the week this came. I made sure (I thought) to see that it was NOT an extension and the way the add is portrayed, seems as though it is a full barrier. Needless to say, when I got this thing it was just an extension and wasn't going to hold my dog anywhere. I think I heard her laughing or maybe it was a snicker. So don't make the mistake I did! Now I have to pay the damn shipping to send it back. I'm going with the Highland. It's a FULL BARRIER and it's 30 something bucks. So maybe it's just me that's getting one star today or maybe it's the add that needs one star. It should read WeatherTech 60012 Pet Barrier EXTENSION!!! :o(Update: Good job for adding that it's an extension in the title! That would have helped me BEFORE!"
3,Helpful But Not Convenient At This Age,"Years back, it was very helpful for my writing. But with the advent of online dictionaries and thesaurus, this book is no longer convenient. I even forgot the time I last opened this book. I hope this can be made available on CD-ROM and in a more comprehensive package."
4,"Good book, but not the best in series","Anita Blake the tough as nails vampire killer is up to her neck in faeries, zombies, vamps and lots of other undead in the fifth novel of the series. Although Anita is as good as ever, I found the story here a little confusing. I did however enjoy the advancement of the Jean Claude storyline. With Richard almost no where in sight in this book, there was a lot of interaction between JC and Anita, and we learn a bit more of his background. I also enjoyed the development of of the character of Larry, Anita's protege. I think this book is more of a turning point in the series, and although I don't think it is as good as the previous four books, a not so great Anita book is still better than a lot of the other stuff out there."
3,"bleah, i'm a fashion plate vampire...","Hamilton's stories are just what they say they are on the book jacket, scary and sexy. but i don't know... they're going downhill. if i have to read one more detailed 2 page description of the clothes blake is wearing... the books were an odd blend of romance novel and horror fiction which i liked. i'm not a romance novel kind of guy but they were cool. the further i get into the series the more the emphasis is on the romance and the less it is on the horror. i don't think i can take it anymore honestly. who cares how ""yummy"" blakes werewolf boyfriend looks? you might, but i don't. i don't want to read about short skirts or tight pants. i want to read about vampires and werewolves and zombies. there's less and less of that in every book. its getting to the point where i like the STORY but not the WRITING. i feel bad because the earlier books were so good, but... if you must buy them buy them used."
3,Bloody Bones by Laurell Hamilton,"I have read all the Anita Blake books by Laurell Hamilton. This particular series is in a decline in my opinion. She spends to much time describing rooms and what people are wearing, and uses the same lines over and over again in the books. This particular book I would say is ""OK"" so I gave it a 3. I hope future books are better."
2,plot fell short of the tagline,I got this because it sounded interesting. MAJOR MISTAKE It should come with a warning. OBNOXIOUS MAIN CHARACTER ON BOARD Anita's demeanor grated on me. Not only was she petty but the entire time she kept complaining and gloating it just made me want to slap her. The entire book isn't worth your time. Skip this and pick any title by Sandra Brown.
2,Great start dwindling in a lackluster conclusion,"I really enjoyed the first few chapters of the book. I liked the character of Larry, the idea of him being Anita's apprentice. Where the book started to take a nosedive was when Serephina and her cohorts joined the picture. There were too many plot threads that she tried to tie in. If the book had continued in the same vein as it started, it would have been at least a 3 1/2 maybe a 4 star review. Instead, it fizzled out."
3,"Jean-Claude, Fairie and Larry...","Anita Blake has to train Larry, fight off Jean-Claude, who she is starting to see as not-a-vampire, and figure out what is happening. Teens have been slaughtered in a way she has never seen, somebody wants her raise a whole graveyard, and fairie seem to be dealing with more power than even they can handle. Blood, magic and a good dose of sex. Would seem to be a great book? But unlike most of Hamilton's books, this one is neither a hit or a miss. Not bad enough to stop running the whole series but not good enough to have ever stood on its own. If this had been the first book in the series I would have stopped with it and taken my money someplace else. As it is Larry, Jason and Jean-Claude save the book for me. Anita is just not interesting. Too realistic to impress me - she is always getting beat up and seems helpless half the time - and yet sometimes too lucky to be real. Without her luck she WOULD be nobody.Get it used."
4,Awesome,"All of the Anita Blake books are gory, but I recall this one as being one of the most gory, but I could just be remmebering it wrong. In this one Anita goes away for a job, and gets to spend some one-on-one time with Jean-Claude, without Richard around to get in the way. Jean-Claude comes to help Anita deal with a vampire murderer. This book was great, and i liked the fact that, not only did it take you away from anita's normal life in St. Louis, but it also let you see her relationship with Jean-Claude grow closer."
4,A bloody hit!,This was another great Anita adventure in southern Missouri! I loved this one since Jean Claude assisted in this adventure and he is a very fascinating character. Enjoy learning more about him as we meet vampires he has known for centuries! I admire Anita's ability to control her desire but wonder how long it can last!
4,Anita meets the Fey,"In this book Anita finally seals her wicked repuation with a big old bang. Asked by her boss to settle a land claim dispute by raising a graveyard of zombies she meets the proprietors of a bar, but they just happen to be fey. In the midst of all this she manages to attract the attention of a vampire mistress and pushes too many buttone. This time the one that can save her is her own courage. This book is quite scary in some parts, but again Hamilton manages to make it stay interesting by bringing the unknown element of the Fey and their secrets. It is still quite graphic, but you either love that about the Blake books or you read something else."
4,Bloody Bones,"After the last few books it's refreshing to have a book where the mystery and action carries the entire way through. In this installment Anita is called to raise an entire cemetery of 200+ year old dead people. While working on that the police ask her to investigate a murder-by-vamp of a young girl. In the process of the investigation we meet some fae, a pedophile vampire, and a group of mean vamps that have it out for Anita and Jean-Claude. The sexual tension between Anita and Jean-Claude keeps mounting, and Anita's morals and beliefs get challenged. There is non stop action throughout this book, and an easy to follow yet exciting mystery. Definitely a step up from the last few."
4,It has its up and downs,"The book was hard to put down when I started reading it, it was awesome. But then I had to put the book down. It became boring in the middle, too much fluff. Kept dragging on about Jean-Claude. I picked the book back up with nothing else to do and was Amazed at the ending. Nothing I was expecting. Kind of wished I had not put the book down. It was totally awesome!"
5,Awesome!,"This book was so great. It's not my favorite of the series but it's really close to being. I think all her books are great. She doesn't have the beautiful tall, long-legged heroine. But a realistic petite female who doesn't take s**t from anyone."
5,"Not one of LKH's Best, but still Great !","OK, it seemed a little slow to me, but I got into it towards the end. I wanted to hear more about the fey, and I can't wait for Kiss of Shadows."
4,So far so good,"It took me a long time to start reading Anita Blake's books because I've seen so many bad critics that I just thought it wasn't good enough. But, since I decided to create my own opinion and started reading, I didn't get disappointed. So far, it has been worthwhile."
4,different,"very different I liked it don't get me wrong. Too many people change intodifferent animals, Thats' so strange to me."
3,It's ok,Seems like it's the same stories over and over. got kind of bored with it by the time i finished it.
2,Ah*shaking hand in a so-so manner*,"It was interesting, I supposed, but a little too predictable. She started out with three cases and of course they were all tied in one. The fey thing was interesting but got a little old with the including of Rawhead and Bloody Bones. A little out there in my opinion."
3,Interesting addition,"Yet another Anita Blake book where a lot is added without warning. Thankfully, Bloody Bones is an interesting enough read that you can forget that not all of it makes sense.There's a lot of good stuff here though. A lot of vampire hunting, corpse animating action, and even some supernatural creatures that haven't made appearances in this series yet. I won't tell you what they are, but they're always good to see.Jean-Claude fans will be pleased with his amount of page time and the ever increasing sexual tension between him and Anita. Jason fans (like myself) will enjoy seeing him again back in his prime bad boy days. People who like seeing Anita actually solve cases and in general kick butt will enjoy this.It's not groundbreaking literature, but it is an all around good read with some great developments to a promising series."
4,My last of Anita,"Seeing how this book ends and knowing what happens later in the series, this will probably be my final Anita Blake book. It is has a very good premise and I like that it is set away from St. Louis. It makes for good times. It develops the story of Anita's powers and brings Jean-Claude into focus. A good read."
2,"So slow, it could be required reading in high school","This book took forever to go anywhere. I read 1/3 of the way through before anything happened. During this time a bunch of contractions are raise. 1) A monster killer is dating, not 1 but 2 monsters. 2) You can't kill a vamp without a court order, but the vamps can kill anyone without one.By the time stuff started happening, all the excitement for the book was gone so the rest was, for me, uninteresting.Then, to top everything off, the beasty that everyone wanted to make them stronger, is the easiest of all the characters to kill.I was looking for a good Halloween story. I read the reviews for this book. All I can say is I don't think I could endure another one of her books."
5,A vicious vampire plot,"Anita Blake is my kind of vampire slayer-hunter. I love vampire books of all kinds, this one though is different. Anita can stick up for herself, thats what makes these books so much more readable than the ""oh-no the heroine has fallen, the vamp is gaining on her ahh!""type of book. I havent yet read any of the other Anita books, infact I just discovered this one. I cant wait to read the rest"
3,"Not too good, but still ok!","The hero came from an aristochrate family with blue-blood inheritance and wealth, while the heroine had a very opposite background and poverty.Antonio's kid brother & Sophie's half-sister were married, but not a happy-ending one, one died in an accident and the other died from an illness after the child was born.They had met 3 years earlier, but then some misunderstandings made the man despised Sophie. But then her late sister appointed Antonio & Sophie as a guardian for their baby niece, and this brought them together in a marriage by arrangement.The whole story reminds me of BOND OF HATRED, from the same author, which I love a lot-lot-lot more and would read it times and times without getting bored.While in this one, there are ups and downs along the story but then it doesn't really come with something which can make you enjoy it, it's almost plain.Anyway, for Ms.Graham's fans, this book might not so bad."
1,don't buy it,"I got One decilious Shiitake mushroom after I received the log in one week.two months later, the log began to rot."
3,"Fun, but low producing","I like the fact that the log will last for a long time so even if it does not produce many mushrooms initially, maybe I'll get better results down the road. I only got one mushroom so far and it was the first shiitake mushroom I ever ate. I dried it out in the over on low low heat for about 5 hours, then chopped it up in olive oil, butter and chopped onions and let simmer. Then, I poured it over small roast I was cooking. I never tasted anything like it. I'm hooked but no one sells shiitakes around where I live so I guess I'm going to have to grow my own. If my log starts produces more, I'll update this review."
3,Not as amazing as promised... but I am having fun!,"The package arrived on time, with instructions and a little recipe book. I got my log four weeks ago. I tried twice to shock it with cold water, I followed all the instructions, and I only got (until now) two tiny mushroom heads coming out of it.... really slowly. However, my family is having fun, every morning we look at the little log and it is fun to see it growing at its own pace. We make jokes about which recipe we will select from the book when we can harvest our first bunch of mushrooms. If you want to have tons of fresh shiitake, this is not for you. If you enjoy having living creatures in your house, see your plants grow, get this very particular pet."
4,Shroom Shroom,Wow - after initial issue that the sellers more than took care of - mushrooms are blooming and couldn't be happier!
1,mushroom log,"I purchased one of these for my son who loves to garden, and can make anything grow - well NOT THESE! He tried everything in the directions to make it grow, but nothing ever happened! It was disappointing to think that I had given my son a piece of a log for Christmas - and that's all it was - just a barren piece of a log. I guess he can use it for fire wood."
1,Waste of money,"I have tried every possible tip, time and time again. This is a waste of money. No mushrooms, not even a hint of growth. Long story short, I paid $30.00 for a small piece of fire wood. Don't make the same mistake I did. Buy your mushrooms from the store."
1,Disappointing,After many months of dilligent soaking and chilling we've had a total of three mushrooms. Also gave as a gift and was a no go with them as well. Very disappointing and a waste of $$.
1,Not a single mushroom.,"I was really excited to try this out - my family keeps a large garden, and we thought a mushroom log would be a perfect addition. But after following the instructions to the letter, we never got a single mushroom. We actually tried following the instructions for soaking, etc. several times after the first try proved unsuccessful, and then left the log outside in a shady, damp spot for a couple of months just to see if anything would come of that, and still not a single shroom. I can see how this would be great if you can get anything to grow, but for us it turned out to be just a $20 piece of log."
4,"Like the content, lukewarm on the presentation","This book will change the way you preach and communicate. It is clear, well written, and effective. I read it once a year to brush up on some of the principles. At the same time, the novel story format leave a little to be desired. It doesn't detract anything from the principles but it isn't everyone's cup of tea."
3,Substituted different number,"Did not receive the filter I ordered, but a substitute and a different number. The filter did work after I had to cut it to the size of the original. This should have been noted when I ordered as I would have used a different vendor."
3,It Is an OK Product,We are using the 2nd filter of our 3 pack humidifier filters. It is good for it's price. But each filter only last for a couple of weeks...Our previous more expensive filter humidifies a lot better and last almost 3 months.I'm going to re-think before buying these filters again.
3,Not as good as it could be,"Pluses: lots of good, current how-to information with plenty of photos/illustrations.Minuses: photos are black and white--they should be color at this price, and would be a lot easier to understand with the extra information color provides. Should be more consideration of *why* one might use a particular material or technique, instead it covers mostly the *hows*. The presentation is rather dry--the opposite end of the spectrum from the ...For Dummies books. A larger format would help make the photos and diagrams easier to follow"
4,Good for the DIY,"This book is loaded with helpful pictures to assist any DIY with a roofing project. I gave it only 4 stars because the BUR section is too brief with no cold app section and the use of cap nails is pictured but not in text for BUR. The book was still helpful in many areas that are part of BUR. If you are doing shingles, buy this book. If you are doing BUR, buy this book and consult your manufacturer's website and technical division for installation instructions and questions."
2,metal roofers need not apply,"This book has much info on traditional roofing methods, but if you want useful, up to date info on applying metal roofing, forget it! In this whole book, there are only a handful of pages dedicated to metal roofing( and even they appear outdated). I was very disappointed ...had nothing useful on metal roofing!"
3,"Good, but a little dated","This book does a decent job of explaining roofing to the novice. It covers all the basics of planning, tear-off, prep, and installation, including a variety of specific types of roofs and sections. It felt a bit dated to me as it has very limited coverage of laminated (architectural) shingles and use of power nailers. There is a greater amount of detail on hand-nailing and alternative traditional materials than you see in some other books. The pictures are all in black-and-white which makes it very hard to tell what is supposed to be conveyed. More drawings or color photos would make things easier, particularly given that some of the methods are complex and the descriptions aren't always written clearly. All-in-all this book is adequate to the task for most do-it-yourselfers, but may not be ideal depending on your specific project."
5,Excellent Read!,What an excellent read. What Mr. Celente wrote in 1991 is even more relevant today. Don't miss this GEM! Thank you Mr. Celente!
4,A Guilty Pleasure!,"Okay, so it isn't O'Neill. The script could even be called a bit silly but...how can you not love it? Fans of the original Beastmaster will like this installment. I'll admit it isn't as good as the original but the story is fun and doesn't take itself too seriously. And Marc Singer still looks FANTASTIC! Who could ask for more?"
2,Disappointed Fan,"I usually buy albums by Jessica Molaskey as soon as they come out - I'm a real fan of her unique style and voice and her creative combination of songs. Even her liner notes are personable and interesting. This album is a major disappointment. The song selection is not nearly as good - it feels like I've heard these songs before. Even worse, there is a huge dud: combining the Waters of March with The Circle Game might have looked good on paper but is a major train wreck - I can't believe it got on the album. From now on, I will not be automatically buying a Molaskey album without checking it out very carefully."
3,Tattooing Portraits with Nikko Hurtado,Honestly he could have done better job on this one. If you're at the point where portraits are the next challenge that means you have quite a bit of experience in tattooing and you're familiar with your equipment and how to make stencil.I did not get information I hoped for and in my opinion it's Not worth the price. I've got more useful info watching videos online than this one thinking it is what you pay for but this is not the case.If you expect him to show/tell you any of his secrets/tips then you are as wrong as I was.As for seller - fast delivery and awesome customer service.
5,Amazing,I would highly recommend this dvd to anyone wanting to learn more about tattooing. You should definitly see this dvd.
3,If Life is a Game Stories reviewed,"This book has some excellent stories to accentuate the original book. However, it is difficult to make the links to the original book. To be better, this book should have provided clearer links - eg: summary at end of each story how the story links to the rule or subrule.With that said, it is great to see stories from all over the world which highlight the rules."
1,zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz!,"this one was intended to be the soundtrack of a Miyake fashion show, but it sounds as an hour of boring childish reiterative lullabyes. despite a very nice package and considering the fact that the import cd has a price tag of nearly $40, you should really be careful before ordering this album. If you like Takemura, however, you will be delighted by his ""Scope"" Cd, which is out on Thrill Jockey, it's cheaper, better and much more inspired than this one."
3,West coast only.,This is for north-western hunters. Drawings are low quality. I wouldn't trust myself with just this book.
5,top quality,perfect size this time. Much lighter and easier to wash by hand. many other choices to select from on their website.
5,As advertized.,"Nothing special about this product, black metal mesh with a raised circular part. Very sturdy.I custom cut two 4 and 9/16th"" holes in the top of my case to mount this so it would stick up and become flush or something close. to my surprise I was a little off on the measurement of the raised part, it actually measures 4 and 7/16ths inches. I must have measured something wrong at one point, but I cut the holes before I received the product in the mail so its entirely my fault. Went with some silverstone covers to place over the holes to improve aesthetics, now I know for my next case mod. Hope I help you too!"
5,my n scale bank,"This Bachmann bank looks great on my layout. Plus it was already factory built, so I didn't waste time with putting pieces together."
1,Worst sex book I've seen,"Poorly written, very poorly structured. Conflicting statements on or near the same pages. The whole book can be summed up by ""don't have sex"" (which is what the book's about)- but it is of little realistic value to helping to build any relationship. Lots of references to scientific studies giving various percentages of bad opinons/ memories about sex. Plenty of boy-bashing...I think there was actually blood on one of the pages! Most of the problems she presented could be helped or solved with communication - which she has dedicated little of her book to - and not surprisingly, it is only on ""how to say no"". I doubt I will finish this book."
5,Suburban Masterpiece,"Kevin Smith delivers a tongue in cheek look at the underwhelming cirumstances of ""everyday life"". Be it love, death, friendship, or selfloathing; Mr.Smith has an ear for the middle american inner monologue. As gratuitous and obscene as the demeanor of the dialogue may be; it is this commitment to telling the truth which reminds us of that small feeling of humanity we tend to forget at the end of the day."
5,one hell of a fantastic book,"Any fan of the Jersey triology must read this book. Also, it can help aspiring writers. It helped me in many ways. I was able to improve on my dialogue"
5,kevin smith is a genius,"i worship the work of kevin smith. clerks is his best film ever, and thank god for this amazing book, which has his screenplay. chasing amy the movie, and its screenplay are also brilliant. the only thing i dont like about this book is that it is missing the screenplay to mallrats. if you have a good sense of humor, then pick this book up, and then go rent the movies."
4,GO TO THE STORE!,"I can't express in words how funny Clerks is. I don't get tired of it laughing every time. Kevin Smith a very talented writer makes a movie about two store clerks (one serious about his job, one not) that try and get it through a wacky weird day. I have the comic of Clerks which is just as funny. Chasing Amy on the other hand isn't so great. Not to funny. More of a drama then a comedy. I would give Chasing Amy 3 stars. Clerks rated R: for explicit language. Chasing Amy rated R: for explicit language"
5,Clerks!Chasing Amy!Snootchie Bootchies!,Great(I mean Great Book)Book!Kevin Smith Rulz!Anyone Like Mallrats?Email me if you do!Kevin made a big mistake saying that was his worst movie.It's Great!
1,broke after 6 months,"After about six months, it stopped keeping time, even with new batteries. It had no fog or water damage whatsoever, it just started running slow."
4,Simple and effective...though not truly waterproof,"I have purchased three of these over a seven year period. Simple design, easy to read, great for the bathroom or pool area. I hang them in the shower stalls in my house. The first one, an earlier model, had a screw-on back which I preferred to the current type (which you must pry off to change the battery). The first one worked for at least four years but then it began to run slow and erratically, even with new batteries. I have had its replacement for about two years and so far, it's kept perfect time. I have noticed, though, when changing the battery, a drop or two of water has made its way into the unit. Certainly that moisture can't be good and it's probably the reason these clocks eventually die. They are water resistant but not water proof. Still, given the price, I'm plenty happy if I get four or five years out of one of these little clocks. I recently purchased another one."
5,Exactly what I wanted,"All time disappears when my wife takes a shower. After hanging this clock in the shower we are no longer ""as"" late to appointments, reservations and get-togethers with friends."
3,Water resistant - but not water proof,Pretty happy with the clock - ran for a couple of years with a need to change the batteries being pretty rare. Didn't steam up and was very helpful. It's worth noting that recently it stopped working. I assumed it was the batteries. So I took the top off and took the batteries out and noticed something stinging. Water had made it's way into the battery case and had corroded the batteries. The acid leaked out and then burned my hands (not badly) when I reached in. The clock of course was dead at this point. I am still getting another one and will assume it was a one time deal. Just look before you reach in - some (well at least one) does leak and the burn takes a long time to heal.
5,Zelco Aguatime Rope Clock,Love this shower clock! It's easy to read and waterproof. Have had it for a year now and have had no problem. Excellent for the price!
2,Kept time for only 2 months,"I purchased this item in September of 2010 and changed the time for Daylight Savings in November. It was fine until January 24th when the time read as 1am even though it was 2am. I went to bed and figured I would change it later. When I awoke, the time was ahead 2 hours instead of 1 hour behind. The clock hangs from a place in my shower where not one drop of water has ever been on it, so this is unfortunate."
5,Hard to find Retro Clock on a Rope,I had one of these and the clock died. I bought one with suction cups and it died in less than 6 months. I like having this in the bathtub so I know when it is time to get out and head to bed before the night turns into day:)
4,Happy with purchase,"We bought this to replace a very old, similar clock and were pleased that it was almost identical to the original. It is just what we wanted."
3,Recipes Look Great -- But Check Carefully for Errors,"I am a retired Registered Dietitian and a person who likes ""healthy eating"" and interesting recipes. I just purchased this book. As my first foray into making a recipe, I prepared ""Burgundy Beef in Pasta Shells with Tomato Sauce"", p.194. I carefully followed the recipe and ended up with twice as much filling and 1/2 as much sauce as needed for 16 shells. Plus, I needed a much larger casserolle, 9x9"", than recommended. Either the author has not prepared the recipe, or, more likely, the errors slipped by in the proof-reading stage of publication. My revised version (with canned spaghetti sauce) tasted great. I look forward to trying several other recipes, but I will be careful to ask myself if the ingredient proportions seem right."
1,buy at your own risk,"They put some sort of program on the disk to protect it from being copied - FINE. But see, it is supposed to play normally in CD players and sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't. I have tried it in several players. I really feel cheated!"
5,"""Lipstick"": The Best Album ever by The Queen of Rock.","Alejandra Guzm√°n perfectly represents the meaning of what a true artist is. Appropiately know as the ""Queen of Latin Rock"", this mexican woman has been rock & rollin'(...), and she gets better and better through the years. We thought that it could not get better than SOY (2001), her previous studio album, but ""Lipstick"" proves how she is in a constant evolution, but always true to her musical identity. LIPSTICK has a very dark, hard rock, kind of gothic sound she had not explored before. Having worked with Desmond Child on her last two albums probably helped her find that super rocker sound that suits her so well, even in the english version of the title track. Alejandra, you are and will be forever the queen of rock.(...)"
5,EXELENTE GUZMAN,"Uno de los mejores trabajos de Alejandra Guzman, tardo unos cuantos a√±os en superar cd's como Libre o Enorme, pero al fin llego, exelente musica, letras insuperables y una producci√≥n de fotos y tapa muy pocas veces vista."
5,UN TRABAJO EXTRAORDINARIO!!!!!!!!!!!!,"SIN DUDA ALGUNA LIPSTICK ES UNO DE LOS MEJORES CD'S DE ALE, SI NO ES QUE EL MEJOR, CLARO QUE NO HAY QUE QUITARLES CREDITOS A OTROS DE SUS CD'S COMO SOY, LIBRE, ALGO NATURAL, ETC. ESTE CD CONTIENES NUEVOS RITMOS PARA ALEJANDRA LO CUAL ME PARECE MUY BUENOS YA QUE LA HACE SER UNA ARTISTA QUE VA A LA BANGUARDIA.LAS CANCIONES SON PRADISIMAS. LA VERDAD TODAS SON MUY BUENAS. DEMORO MAS DE DOS ANOS EN SACAR ESTE CD, PERO SABES QUE ONDA, VALIO LA PENA LA ESPERA YA QUE EL CD TE CONAGIA CON LA BUENA MUSICA QUE TIENE. SIN DUDA ALGUNA ES UN CD. QUE SE VA A CONVERTIR EN UN CLASICO. TE ASEGURO QUE NO TE ARREPENTIRAS EN COMPRARLO."
5,The best album from the Latin Queen of Rock,"This album is absolutely the best in her career. The title track doesn't speak very well about the album in general, but all the songs are excellent. The best tracks: ""Tengo Derecho a Estar Mal"", ""Hoy Me Voy a Querer"", ""Mi Luz"" and ""Lipstick (English Version)"" are pure energy. If you like good rock this album is for you. Plus: it contains the ""Lipstick"" video."
5,REINA DEL ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This has to be the best album in her career.WOW!! no, accent on her english track. Great job alejandra guzman. Here is one mexican artist that can represent.This is not a border girl album . wether its live or studio alejandra guzman delivers. desmond child and alejandra guzman, great combo.***** all the way."
4,Informative,If you fish in the Sierras or like to hike the high country this is an excellent book . It is specific to the region and very informative. I would definitely recommend it as a worthwhile addition to any Sierra Fly fisherman's library....JAK
5,Help for dealing with the emotional crisis of infertility.,"There are very few resources to help get through the emotions associated with the experience of infertility. Finally, a dvd that shares the pitfalls other couples dealt with and gives solid advice to help deal with this devestating experience. I found this very easy to watch, particularly the sections that were important to me at the time."
4,An excellent sample of research on prehistoric violence,"This volume provides a useful selection of metholodogical and theoretical papers confronting archaeologists studying prehistoric violence. Data from the Anasazi culture of the prehistoric American Southwest have become the focus of heated dbate in recent years. Was their world a violent one characterized by warfare, cannibalism, ritual sacrifice or relgious persecution? Did they practice mortuary customs that might mimic these processes? The scholars in this volume place the study of possible Anasazi violence within a larger context of prehistoric violence in the new world in an attempt to answer these questions. This is necessary reading for all southwestern archaeologists. Other Archaeologists and the general public would also enjoy reading this volume. Well done."
5,Exquisite Music by Ruth Watson Henderson,"Exquisite and ethereal choral music by Ruth Watson Henderson, a wonderfulcontemporary composer. The melodies are breathtaking, whether they are written for pieces like Gloria or Cantate Domino, or poetry by James Weldon Johnson. She captures the best of choral music for me. I heard one of her pieces sung by the New Amsterdam Singers in New York City and rushed to findone of her CD's!Mady Goldstein, NYC"
5,A True Guitar Hero!,"I am impatiently waiting for the new Michael Thompson cd (MT Speaks) to hit the stores, but I must say ""The World According to MT"" is an incredible album!! The songs are good, phenomenol guitar playing! His solo on ""A Chang is Gonna Come"" alone is worth the price of the cd. He has a great touch,tone and feel for rock guitar and has jazz knowledge which helps him outplay 98% of the other guitarists out there. Like Tim Pierce (LA studio giant), Michael plays very eloquent rock guitar and sounds great doing it. This is an essential purchase for any lover of guitar!"
5,Way Too Cool,"My band was playing this 1965 class reunion and I needed to dress in the right time frame, well needless to say these glasses were a hit! Very happy with the purchase and the shipping was also very fast!"
3,The Glasses,"these glasses are great and all,but they have a slightly yellow tint to the glass,but its not a big deal if your usin em for a one time thing.another thing that got on my nerves was that they dont exactly appear right in the picture.really, they have more a square look.the lower outside edges are less curved like they show in the picture or on other glasses like these.these are closer to 90 degree angles.but if you dont mind a slight different look then go ahead and get them."
3,Nerd Glasses,"These were purchased as ""nerd glasses"" for my son's Halloween costume. They are cheaply made but one has to consider it's a costume piece. They were okay for the price."
2,Broken,"I ordered these glasses for part of a halloween costume. They were very inexpensive and prime eligible, so I bought them. They arrived on time, packaging was fine.Unfortunately, when I opened the package, the glasses were broken. The right side was broken off...Due to timing, we just taped them up, used them for the night and got rid of them.They were only a few dollars so I'm not that surprised that they broke. It may have happened during the shipping process? Besides being broken, everything else was fine for what we needed them for."
4,GI Romance,"I was tempted to rate this with 5 stars as the story truly is outstanding. A few editing problems and leaden writing at the start of the story preclude perfection, but I highly recommend the book to any reader who enjoys gay romance and historical fiction. The descriptive battle scenes evoke wartime horror much like Stephen Crane in the Red Badge of Courage, and of course the story itself is reminescent of Mary Renault's The Charioteer. At his best, the author approaches the quality of prose in both these classics. The price is a bit daunting for a paperback, but for a quality story like this consider it money well spent. This is a book I'll keep on my shelf and read again. I hope the author continues writing, perhaps even a sequel to this fine novel."
1,Bad fire video,This is one of the worst fireplace videos I have ever seen. Most of the screen is filled by a wall rather than the actual fire. The sound is also lackluster.
1,Disappointed,I was very disappointed. I bought this as a gift. First it shows a fire and fireplace from a distance with all the brick work. Later it zooms in somewhat but you are viewing the fire through the doors. It is also not an eternal flame. Meaning the DVD ends. I was trying to purchase one like I have(purchased from Amazon several years ago). That one just shows the fire and it does not end.
5,My fireplace,I feel I have a real fireplace in my home and I love the crackling and the placement of a log on the hearth.
5,great fireplace,I got this fireplace DVD I live in a small apartment and turn this on at night and sleep it almost like a real fireplace
3,music nice but not the fire,"I much preferred the one I bought years ago, the fire was much nicer, more flames etc. more enticing. All this was, was one log that kept burning the same, plus you saw some guys arm come across to put a falling log back on.....The one big advantage I liked what the music, that you could play background music, that was the trade off. It did the trick but I will look for the one I had previously, much nicer flames, even my family thought so too."
2,not very good,they seemed more into displaying their stone work than the fire. too much zooming in and out. not as clear as expected for a blu ray
4,Love King's writing ...,"Shadow Men is the third installment in the Max Freeman series. King is a masterful story teller. In each book he manages to convey a little more of Freeman's past - beautifully blending the present story with glimpses into his childhood and tragedy shortened police career. Shadow Men takes Freeman back into the Everglades for most of the action. At the behest of Billy Manchester Freeman attempts to solve the 80 year old murder of a man and his two sons while they labored building the Tamiami Trail. Freeman is flawed, his love interest Sherry Richards is conflicted and the characters he meets are believable. King's prose alone makes the reading worthwhile - the only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars was the implausibility of the tale - 80 year mysteries are harder to solve than this."
4,He can write,"I'll have to get the earlier books, because this man is a pro. He can give you the texture of the Glades and the taste of the city."
1,This book is a Big Lie! Joe is an Insurance Industry Puppet,"Lieberman does not work for the public nor does he do it any service: he is a puppet for the insurance industry. I found this book to be a complete phony representation of the real Joe Lieberman. During the last election cycle, Lieberman accepted over $730,000 from the insurance industry, according for the Center for Responsive Politics. And now he has come out against a public option for health care or extending medicare for people over 55. The people of Connecticut should be ashamed to have this man (another corporate crony) representing them!!!!"
1,"""Slim"" book is a good description","More platitudes, by an author willing to abandon any principles if doing so will inflate his ego."
3,So-so at some parts but an all around good book,"Some parts of this book are a little boring but as you get into it you'll find that the senator's thoughts and ideas are interesting. This book was written before his vice-presidential, and presidential campagines so don't expect to hear about them but if you'r interested in knowing what he's really about read this book!"
5,Does what it is supposed to and well milled,"Excellent piece of equipment, nicely milled. Requiring more words for a review of a simple disk of milled metal is absurd."
3,Obama Documentaries,"I share the same opinion as many who've seen this DVD. I mean it's alright, but I feel like I wanted to see something that confronted the issues and ideals of the campaign AND talked about his personal story. I've been following and working on Obama's campaign from the very start, and I have to say that it's been a long journey to success. I think that the best DVD I've seen so far has been President Barack Obama: The Man and His Journey. Vivendi Entertainment put it out, and it is really informative and comprehensive. It has the song by Brian McKnight, ""Yes We Can,"" and of course his life story and the road to Congress. There are really good interviews and special features in general, too. Mainly, the story is presented in such a well rounded way, that I was even more impressed AFTER I watched it at how incredible Obama and the campaign have been. It officially comes out Inauguration Day--January 20th, I believe."
2,Bio - DVD,It started off really well. Got a little choppy and then ended abruptly. Almost as the rest of the information didn't get transferred to the DVD. Very strange. I would be a little concerned about purchasing another DVD made by Bio.
2,"Lite and thin. A few of the basics, but little more.","I can't imagine buying this lightweight biography of Barack Obama. I was interested to learn about the man's childhood and his rise to power, but found myself wanting a good deal more. For one thing, there's little critique at all. I'm an ardent Obama supporter, but I would have appreciated a more well-rounded discussion. Furthermore, the producers might have bothered to discuss his legislation, his political philosophy, and his place with regard to the major issues of the day. But no mention of 9/11, fiscal policies, war, or health care. Very little is offered other than some biography about the man's family. In a sense, this video exempflifies the deplorably shallow state of US journali$m today. Afraid to ask questions of power, US info-tainment ends up only serving power."
4,Item purchased for my mom,"I purchased the DVD for my mom's collection. She is very pleased. The price and shipment time was excellent.Thanks,Jackie"
1,Incomplete and somewhat over-complimentary,"I wish that this biography had more NEW information in it versus what is already easily publicly available via a Google search. Also, it seems a bit like a plug for Obama versus a factual account of his life and history."
4,More than a split decision result,"If you have Netflix unlimited streaming , you could check out this VERY interesting TRUE story about the gentleman who IS the real life inspiration for Sly's terrific ROCKY films . No horse hocky . Chuck Wepner got an ""undisclosed settlement"" from Stallone for having cribbed so much of Chuck's life . That's just less than half this fascinating true story of Chuck Wepner though . Don't get me wrong , i love Sly Stallone , but here's some stuff you didn't know and a great boxing bio too . Check it out . Wow knew ? Clearly not many as i'm the fist cat to write about it on Amazon and i don't know much about boxing . Worth a purchase if needed ."
1,Dated,"I usually love Elizabeth Thorton's books, but I could not get past the first half of ""Bluestocking Bride"". Stiff, formulaic characters with not much to like. Don't waste your time or money on this reprint, I wish I had not."
1,Buyer beware!,"This book contains reprints of older works - written in a time (80's) when it was ""politically correct"" to have situations happen in a relationship that would now make us cringe. I found this work too offensive to finish."
4,I Am Not Jackson Pollack,Short stories that penetrate into the deeper motivations of the characters actions. Beautifully written. Worth re reading too.
5,"Dense, technical, informative","As you might tell by the title, this is not a book for the music novice. But for the reader with a good grasp of theory, this book is a blessing in furthering the understanding of what happens at the deeper levels of music. True, Berry's sentences are long and involved, but worth wading through to get at the content. If you love music theory, you simply must have this book--it's an unbelievable amount of information packed into one small space. It completely changed my understanding of music theory and the way I think about music theory. Not a summer read, by any means, but buying this book was definitely a no-brainer!"
3,No pegboard!,"This product is pictured with a pegboard, however, it only comes with the pegs and laces. I'm satisifed with the quality of the pegs and laces, but there really isn't much to do with them other than stacking them into one tall tower without the pegboard. Am I missing something?"
4,Biography - Ben & Jerry's,"This documentary is about Ben and Jerry and the famous ice cream company. I really enjoyed this program. To me Ben & Jerry's Ice cream is one of the best ice cream snacks out there. This program follows Ben & Jerry through the good and bad times. I just couldn't stop watching from the first minute to the last. The most shocking thing about the whole program is that Ben & Jerry were brought out and done even own the company that has their name on it. Both were paid well for their company, but they can't get back all the time and life's work that went behind it.Great program!"
1,UltraLast ULNPFM50 Digital Camera Battery Pack for Sony NP-FM M Series,"I am totally not happy with this battery; it continuously charges, up to 24 hours, after I have taken only a few pictures.I actually reinstalled my old battery to have the camera ready when needed, and I would never buy this product again."
5,Pearl Harbor - Two Hours That Changed the World,"I had seen this ABC special several years ago and thought it very good. Although it was for the 50th anniversary of the Attack on Pearl Harbor, and we're now at the 70th anniversary, I still found it informative and entertaining."
5,a wise purchase,"Given the fact that the Gameboy Advance is still a relatively new system that many people already own, some consumers may be hesitant about shelling out 100 bucks for a ""newer"" version of the GBA.This is understandable, however, there are 2 major improvements on the new GBA SP. First, as you probably already know, there is a built-in screen light on the SP...now you can actually see the game you are playing without ending up with neck cramps. Fans of the Gameboy have been waiting for this feature for awhile, now it is available.Secondly, the new unit is so much more compact. It folds up, thus making it smaller as well as providing protection for the lcd screen. No more scratches."
5,Awesome,"I got this on the first day it came out and I'm impressed. The GBA SP eventually pays for itself. you don't need to buy a stupid...wormlight that leaves a glare on the screen( The built in light works very good, I played it in complete darkness!) and you don't need to buy...bateries every week. When you're not playing you just plug it in and charge it. If an outlet is around you plug it in and save you're bateries! On long car rides turn the light off and then turn it on when you go through a tunnel. The bateries last a loong time. So, Game Boy fans, buy and enjoy this."
4,the best thing to happen to Nintendo,I have it and its awesome I played it in a dark room and I can see it clearly. It is the best thing to happen to Nintendo.
1,What is SP? Super [Weak]?,ok here is the bottom line. The only 2 good changes is the rechargeble battery and the built-in light. The buttons on the dang thing feels really weird. It costs so much for so little changes. Dont spend money on this unless you hav so much money u dont care. Trust me this isnt the way 2 go.
1,Nintendo just has to do it...,"Man after seeing this i feel so ticked! I now have an inferior model, and Nintendo wants me to shell out $... more. Forget that! Nintendo should have done it right in the first place, or created some internal add on package like the after burner that you could send to them or some other electronics place for $... buck installation. But really, ... bucks for a new system that is not as comfortble as the other (It really is too small, and the l r buttons are easy to accidently press, and yes i have played it before.) has no head phone jack, and a battery that last for 10 hours (U always need a light) before charging(*Cough* in car *Cough*)? Give me a break. I'll stick with my pelican light shield and battery packs that i can change if I'm in the car and they run out of juice. Really Nintendo, this was a bad choice."
5,The Best Ever,"Terrific. Outstanding. And the best ever. The gameboy advance SP or GBASP is the best hand held system. No matter the color, you won't be dissapointed. The GBASP is fun and very entertaining. If you haven't purchased one, do so as soon as possible. Play lots of games finally under your covers with your built in light. This is a great invention. You WILL NOT be dissapointed. Well, I hope this helped you in deciding about the GBASP, a great entertainment system. Worth a lot more than 5 stars. NO DISSAPOINTMENT!"
4,A Great New System,"The Gameboy Advance SP is almost everything Gameboy needs. It looks like a Gameboy Color on the outside, but it is way different on the inside. Actually, it is a bit different on the outside, because the screen folds down to fit in your pocket. But on the inside, it has many qualities. The screen has color liquid crystal display with up to 32,000 simultaneous colors. There is a self-contained screen light. And there is a built-in rechargeable battery, which provides about 18 hours of continuous game play. So you never have to get new batteries again. You just plug it in with the AC Adapter and it will recharge quickly.I have bought this item and experienced its many qualities. Many people have bought it. When I looked for it, it was sold out almost everywhere! It is truly a great product."
3,gameboy,my son likes it we got it for him for his birthday it doesnt work all the time. you have to keep adjusting the postion of the game to get the game to work that gets frustrating.
5,Best Game Boy yet!!,I did not purchase the game boy advance and waited for the SP to come out. It is well worth the wait! No more dealing with all the crazy lighting tools and very compact!! Best ever by Game Boy. I highly recommend it!!
3,To much to soon,"I have given this console three stars for now. For one, the price is to high. I just recently bought the regular Advance for the reducted price, so I guess I'll have to wait for this one to go down. I would of bought the console if it had came out a little later."
4,This Thing Rocks!,"I think think the SP is great! I love the light up screen!For those who came here just to make fun of the SP:Tell it to someone who cares! (as in, not me)"
4,"Pricey, but a very smart unit.","I have always wondered when they would make a screen sophisticated like a computer screen, where the screen is visible in the dark. Well, now they have, and it's about time. I am (hopefully) getting this game by my birthday (beginning of the summer) and the price will probably be down about 10 dollars, if I'm lucky. I will most likely give my GBA to my brother, so we can link up using my collection of GBA games or ones that he may get in the future. The only concern I have is the price, which is a whopping 99.99... I wasted 2 years of saving up to get my GBA (and a game with it) and now they come up with an obviously better system.I give this a 4 out of 5 stars for it's inconvienient release time and price, but the pro's of the system are too many to count."
4,Blows away the old one - turn in your old one and buy this!!,"I'm a video game veteran way back from when pong was around. I bought the gb, gbc and the gba. This is finally where you want to be when it comes to handheld gaming. Why it rocks: BACKLIGHT - no more goofy, not quite right, snake lights and accessories. I cannot overstate the clarity and increased playablity afforded by the new light. Your old games will have a 2nd life as now you are finally able to SEE them. SIZE/APPEARANCE - extremely compact, fits great in an aftermarket leather case. Doesn't look like such a kid's toy. Now you won't look and feel like a 6 year old when you play your GBA-SP Chessmaster while waiting for a flight. This won't make the women think you're a dork. GAMES - A few pretty playable games (that adults can play) with a bunch due out. GBA - not just for Pokemon anymore..."
3,maybe I missed something but the product was missing cord.,"This could be an error on my part no doubt as I am new to the Amazon world of shopping. I bouth this SP and thought it would come with a charger and it did not. Pretty useless right now. I am not rating the seller because it came fast and he did say there were blemishes on the game itself, and described it perfectly. I am just disappointed that I may have not read the description as well as I should have."
5,First Game,"this is my son's first game he was so excited to play it..he loves the 4 games that came with it. Screen show perfect..the carrying case awesome...outside scratched but doesnt matter, just to see the excitment this game puts on my baby's face is priceless. Thanks so much for this excellent bundle"
1,Repeat Crashes,"We bought our son the Game Boy advance SP. The first one lasted less than 3 months, then would not boot up. We returnd it for a second unit that lasted for less than one week, then began to do the same thing. It would begin the boot up sequence and then black out completely. I monitored my son's use of the item very carefully, since he is only 7, and even with care the gameboy still crashed. I don't know if it was a problem with the ""batch"" at the store, or how my son played with it. We were able to return it, but we will wait before buying another one. What a drag."
2,"DON""T BUY THIS GAMEBOY!","Gameboy Micro is soo much better then this gameboy sp because...It's smaller, the screen brightness can be adjusted, faceplates can be changed in about 15 seconds, it fits normal headphones, and it looks cooler."
4,So cool!!!!!,"I just got the gameboy advance sp yesterday and it is the greatest! The best thing, I can't decide! The light is great. you just press a button to turn it on or off and I can play at night in bed and I don't have to constantly adjust the light and you don't have to carry around a light or pay extra! Then there is the flip top so my screen won't get scratched! It's cool it plays all games becuase I have lots of old games! The colour and graphics are totally cool! And, there is an easy feature (read the main manual) that for really old games you can change the colour to blue, dark green, pastel mix, there are 12. It's good for old (regular gameboy or older) becuase it's much more colourful and clearerIf you are buying one, I mean, you ARE buying one, get platinum! It's so cool!!!!!!"
1,Walking Zombies - ZERO STARS,"Well, 500 million sold was the last statistic that I read. I think Japan has almost completed their plan to turn all the kids in this world into walking zombies. I can't tell you how many kids that I see totally ingrossed in these things and since they are portable, can be conveniently played ad infinitem. I'm not a zealot and I don't think it is ridiculous to believe that these things are out of control. Kids aren't reading any more. Math and English skills test have increasing failure rates...over 11,000 3rd graders will be held back in New York City alone. Thanks Nintendo for turning our kids into mindless zombies!"
3,SP..... who needs it.,"Here we have another nintendo Platform with no use. in you have a game boy advance you should NOT buy this system. There are good things about the gameboy advance sp, it has a flip screen, rechargeable battery and a built in light up screen. However you could by a worm light for a reagular gameboy advanced and it take an extremely long time for the battery to fully charge up. As you can guess the buttons are smaller and is uncomfortable to play. If I were were interested in buying this gameboy, I would probobly wait until the new gameboy player expansion for game cube. for more info go to the gameboy player page on this web site..."
4,A marvel of design,"Hats off to Nintendo. They designed a handheld gaming systems that us geeks aren't embarassed to be seen using in public. Improvements over the original design serve several functions. The screen is both backlit and, via the clam shell design, doesn't require a screen protector like the original GBA. Battery life is phenomenal. I've had mine since they were released and my battery still holds a charge like it was brand new.WARNING. MADE LEAD TO HEAVY ADDICTION AND THE COMPULSIVE ACTION OF BUYING SEVERAL GAMES AND ACCESSORIES. ;)"
4,Its got good ideas,This is better than GBA in seeing the screen. I like the idea of rechargeable batteries but you got to wait for them to recharge(you can play it when you are recharging). Its not as comfortable when you hold it unlike the GBA. There is no head phone port to plug in your headphones. I like the screen folding down because the screen is harder to scartch. Its got a bigger screen. Its size is smaller than GBA. You can turn of the backlight for the GBA SP. It dose come with a ac adapter.
3,Game Boy Advance SP,"The Game Boy Advance SP is awesome! It allows me to play original Game Boy games on it. The only thing that I question is if the Game Boy Advance SP was actually brand new. It didn't come in the original box. And there is something rattling in it. Looks like some dust or fuss underneath the screen too. So, I am under the impression it isn't brand new, maybe refurbished."
2,"This is cool, but 4 a hundred dollars???","This is a very cool item i have to admit, but i already have a regular game boy advance. me, personally am not going to buy it, cuz i have an advance already, why spend 100 for just a cooler look, i don't mind the regular advance. i say wait untill the price drops to buy.P.S. go 2 freewebs.com/troys_cool_site"
4,Game boy advance sp,"The Gba sp is great but i gave four stars because of therechargeble battery.I mean,say your going to your friends house with it and he live far away.Then sudenly the is dead and youhave the recharger with you.What do you do then.But its stilla great console.The light is perfect for when your in the darkand plus you don't need to buy an expensive light for your gb.The size is just excelent.I was so jealous when my friends hadone.I'm getting one on monday I hope my review was hepful."
3,there are 2 advances??? darn headache!,"to put it simply this is great if you dont already own a gba but ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, POINTLESS, WASTE OF MONEY if you already own a gba. its that simple. doesnt matter wether it has a back light and rechargable batteries (r. batteries always suck) most back lights damage the screen of the playing sytem. look at the green on all your old game boys."
5,Game Boy Advance Sp is the best video game system yet!,I love my Gameboy Advance sp because of the flip screen and the all new featurs! My Gameboy is[..]and I got it for Christmas in the year of 2004 This is a great game to have because if you are sitting at home or your on vacation with nothing to do you can just pull out your gameboy and start playing! If I met the Nintendo employees I would say that this is the best Game system yet! This is a great Christmas or birthday gift! Parent's if your child does not have a gameboy it would make them really happy if you got them one for Christmas!
4,I Love My SP,I love my sp. One of the best features is the rechargeable battery. Another thing that makes this better than the other game boys is the back light. I used to have too many problems with trying to find the right lighting for the old game boy. I highly recomend this for yourself or a gift.
3,Good But Small Very Small.............,I really enjoyed this but it is bad in some ways i mean it is too small it took me 13 tries just to beat 1 level in Crash Bandicoot N- Tranced and I'm a Crash Bandicoot master ive beaten every Crash game there is.... So if you like something small get the SP but if you like something big get Game Boy Advance. Remember something new always has something bad on it nothing is perfect.
5,Nice But the price,This is a great console in is top of the line but in is too expensiv if sellers lower their price they will get a lot more money
4,GREAT,"this is a great system but one thing...when i die...it gliches but besides that it has a lite, and very copact...and people are riting in there reviews the bad part about it is no head phones well just get over it you dont &quot;need&quot; them ok bi"
5,New system is awsome,"I think the new game boy advance will be a great system that can only be topped with something even greater. The game boy advance is too big and it has no light. People who think the system will be a flop are wrong. Built in lghit, smaller handling, and it folds up, how much better can you get. The light is one of the greatist blessings out of all this, you can have the light and you dont have to void the warrenty by soldiring in your own light. Also the flip up screen can protect your screen. It is still back ward compatible so go out and by the old mario land games. I nver thought i would wanna switch back to the strait standing game boy, but the sp has changed my mind. If you want to best, buy the sp."
1,i like the old game boy better,if you ask me i like gbc the best cause gameboy was made to be a simple system witch the recent ones arent....but anyways my bro had one and the screen fell off IN A WEEK OF USE...HE TOOK GOOD CARE OF IT TO!....just get a gba non sp....how ever the lighted screen is a nice addtion....but i snake light for gba does the same thing....gba was and still is the best handheld....besides n-gage witch is 300$.
1,"NEW VERSION ALERT, NEXT COUNSLE IS COMING OUT","Nintendo relesed info about a new counsle ""NINTENDO DS"" coming out end of Q4. it will be backward compatable with gba games but it will be much better. it has two screens one touch sensetive with better graphics than N64 not to mention built in wireless capabilitys. So if you can wait! It wont be the best much longer. if you get this it will go down in popularaty and value not to menton be out of date real soon. check out nintendo.com for more info."
1,Wow!! How awful. .......,"Wow!! How awful. The GameBoySP is pointless to get. I expected more from Nintendo [on the Cube, too]. The SP was just a cheap trick to get more money from you fools out there who bought it. Lets list the minuses.1]It plays all Gameboy games, yet it has none of its own kind, so you don't HAVE to buy it2]Graphics aren't much of an improvement3]It cost 100 dollars.4]It isn't worth it.5]It's another change in shape you have to get used to6]Not many good games [for all games]7]'Lit screen' add-in is terrible, buy a real oneI leave you with my messageDon't get tha SP"
1,This is a real bad idea,"Nintendo is going down the drain with Gamecube, and we all know it. The statistics show that both Xbox and PS2 are prefered over Gamecube, and they lose more money on it everyday. Nintendo's solution? Make a new gameboy advance! I mean, everyone who wanted a GBA already has one, and the people wanting to get one are probably not going to spend 30 dollars more for a smaller one. And I don't really trust this foldable design, because it is more fragile. And a rechargable battery? Those go down to 7 dollars each! And there are afterburner kits around for the light... The only reason I am looking forward to this is because the originals will go down in price."
1,THIS SUCKS,HELO THIS SYSTEM SUCKS I HATE THE SCREEN WAS SCARCHED WHEN I GOT IT THE BATTERY WAS MISSING AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS MISSING THE CHARGER MY SON WAS VERY DISSAPOINTED SO WERE SWICTHED TO N GAGE THE ARE SO MUCH BETTER 3 D GRAPHICS AND EVERYTHIG NO HE IS SO HAPPY EVERY DAY HE THANKS ME DONT BUY A SP THEY SUCK OR JUST WAIT UNTIL SONY COMES OUT WITH PSP SO PLEASE DONT MAKE YOUR SON DISSAPOINTED
4,cool,"This is a really cool system but if you original gba dont bother. Its nothing new. If you want a light get a worm light, they only cost like $5 and its a little brighter. So if you have original GBA then dont bother with this."
