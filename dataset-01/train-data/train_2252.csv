5,TDK well done!!!!,This disk does what its suppose to do. I would recommend to any small home studio users. There is no deffects
1,SOMEWHAT SATISFIED,"Love the CDRW, but the shipping is outrageous for the product. I bought it because I was forced to, but despise paying more for shipping than the product costs."
4,In the Name of Iran,"This is a book which expalined how this US General prevented Iranian Generals to do Coup when Khomeini would arrive in Iran and secured Khomeini to be safe in Iran. In addition, this General did not understand why the US Administration was forcing Iranian army to buy weapons when there was unrest in Irana and the King was leaving Iran! You do the math."
3,vietnam dvds,the dvd set will learn the general public what the vietnam veterans went through thank a veteran for serving for their country and again cronkite did report it the way it was 9/20/2010
5,Great christmas gift!,"I bought this for my Dad for christmas and he loves it. He is older and loves war books, movies etc etc. He goes on and on about how great it is. Definitely a must have for the war buff that you know."
1,NOT WORTH BUYING!,"This is trash as seen and described by one of America's pro-communist newsman, Walter Cronkite. Soldiers, Sailors and Marine should be appalled by Walter cute little take on things as viewed through ""long lenses""."
5,Extremely Useful Resource,"I think the reviewer that gave this 2 stars for the fact that it wasn't about boys completely missed the point. The woman who wrote this book started a mother-daughter book group and wrote about THAT experience. She also folded in a lot of great book recommendations from a variety of sources, along with many tips about how to have a successful mother-daughter book club. If that is what you are interested in doing or have already started, this will be a very useful resource for you. It will give you ideas about books to read, meeting format, additional activities and other places to look for ideas.A friend and her daughter recently invited my daughter and me to join a book club she was forming. We have used a lot of the ideas from this book and found them to have improved our experience of the book club."
2,JUST OK,"I really don't want to write too much about this film except for that it is extremely average. NOT a bad film - not a great film merely OK not on par with dreamworks or pixar are far as the story goes - the animation is not bad though. The characters and story are just uninteresting, sorry."
3,Great Kid's Movie,"This English movie has realistic and beautiful computer animation. Despite the apparent similarity to Shrek, The Snurks has much more kid appeal than adult appeal. I watched this with my friend's eight year-old. He laughed in all the right places, and kept saying how Gaya was so beautiful, he wished he could live there.The story is very original. A TV series called ""Gaya"" features an heroic duo named Boo and Zino. Boo is the shy, bespectacled genius, while Zino is the handsome, daring, dumb jock who is a big hero. A professor in the real world learns how to use a television set as a transporter device to transport whatever - or whomever - is on the screen. Our little friends soon find themselves trapped in 21st century Earth, where they meet their creator and try to stop the mad professor from destroying Gaya.Lots of action and humor, lovely scenery and effects. Mild language like ""hell"" and ""damn"" a couple of times."
1,snurks stink,"I thought this would be a clever shrek-ish movie, but the kids were bored after about 10 minutes. I'm sad I wasted my money on this one. Not one interesting character and the same action that's in all cartoons these days"
1,This movie sucks,"This movie is absolute garbage, and you would be stupid to order it. The script has more holes than a tank top I own. The relationships of the characters (if they may be called that) are non-existant. We want so badly for this to be a great film because it is a truly unique idea. This movie sucks sucks sucks! It does have one really cool song on its soundtrack, though."
5,Fantastic movie,"This movie's been accused of being Lynchian. Now I am a huge Lynchian fan but this is very different. Lynch isn't too interested in character depth which is one of the main emphasis of this movie.Being a twin myself, I really appreciated the focus on the issue. It handles the difficulties of it in a just way. The Polish Brothers being twins themselves, obviously put some thought into this movie, adding some fresh perspective to the subject, hardly put into the movies. Other than this I loved the dark, dream like feel to the picture. Although it got a bit of attention I think it was sadly overlooked."
3,Hypnotic,"This movie has a hypnotic effect upon the viewer due largely to the subtle acting by Mark and Michael Polish who play enigmatic conjoined twins. An equally enchanting performance is given by Michele Hicks who plays the proverbial prostitute with the heart of gold. The film has an intriguing look to it that greatly adds to its effect upon the viewer. The commentary on the DVD offers edifying insight into how these two brothers wrote, directed, and created the visual moods and images. I look forward to the next creation of the Polish brothers."
4,Excellent First Film,"In comparing ""Twin Falls Idaho"" to the other films in its very narrow genre (indie or foreign films dealing with conjoined male twins) it shines through as being far more sympathetic to its characters. It is also pleasing the way it glides gracefully between dark humor and drama. Unlike Peter Greenaway's brilliant if lurid ""A Zed and Two Naughts"" (1985), this quiet little film is light and refreshing in places. It explores its characters very thoroughly, giving the audience more than just heavy-handed symbolism to consider. ""Twin Falls Idaho"" lacks the budget or scope of drama that made David Cronenburg's ""Dead Ringers"" such a treat. You must keep in mind this is a first film for the Polish Brothers and I think it shows great promise. With the success of such brother filmmaking teams as the Cohens and the Wachowskis, I think these guys have a bright future."
1,Shamelessly cool,"While in some ways an interesting look at a subject that has not been explored much (at all?) in film, this is one of the worst movies I have seen in a while.The script, direction, acting and cinematography are self-conscious to the point of being over-the-top. There are numerous scenes where you could say ""ah I see that's supposed to symbolise THAT"" - there is nothing subtle about Twin Falls Idaho, regardless of its slow pace. Everything is delivered to us with a film-school handbook about metaphors and mood lighting.People have compared the Polish brothers to David Lynch and other directors of his style. Unlike David Lynch's films, this one leaves NOTHING to the imagination. It just looks like it does."
5,An Excellent Film,"I didn't really know what to expect of TWIN FALLS, IDAHO. Much to my surprise, it turned out to be a very beautiful film, about conjoined twins: Blake and Francis. There's something very dark and melancholic about the film. The story is quite original, the direction was very good as well. I was very taken by the Polish brother's protrayl of the twins. You can't help be taken in by them on screen. One often conjures up images of siamese twins as freak show acts, but in this film it's hard not to view them as two distinct people. Very compelling! I highly recommend this film."
2,Not a fan at all......,"This one really disappointed me; the performances are lukewarm at best, and I was stunned that it was as lackluster as it was. I only hope that some of the money I spent on this dvd was sent to Africa to help this cause. I ended up giving this one away; I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I love African/Reggae music (Salif Keita, Midnite, Gidi Gidi Maji Maji, Toure Kunda, etc etc), but this compilation was an absolute waste of money."
4,Good overview of Daltrey's hits,"Although Daltrey is never as powerful with his voice than when he is singing Who songs, still, this album offers a good selection of some of the other things he is capable of. The best song is ""After the Fire"" (penned by Townshend) of course, but I really love the beauty of ""Giving it All Away."" It's good to know that Daltrey is willing to try different vocal ranges and styles. Plus he has one of the best voices that rock and roll has ever seen. I've seen him in concert three times so far, and each time, he has just blown me away. HE IS MY ROCK GOD!"
4,was very nice,Very enjoyable CD excellent retrospect of his career. very underrated-they did a nice job putting this together. their were a ouple of songs i would have liked to see-but is still good
4,"Not The Who, but still pretty good","I bought this album because I was going to be seeing Roger Daltrey on his solo tour, and I realized I didn't know any of his solo stuff. I'm a HUGE Who fan, so I was excited to hear a different side of their amazing frontman. And what a different side it is. The songs here are, for the most part, a lot slower and softer than the hard rockin of the Who, but not without their charms. The standout of the album is probably ""After the Fire"", which I'm sure has something to do with the fact that it is the only song on the album written by Pete Townshend. Give it a shot."
3,The Little Singer,"Ive always loved Roger Daltrey's vocals in with The Who.This CD does a lot to establish his title as one of the great rock vocalists. Its easy to see the amazing range he had as a singer, departing from his usual Who screams for softer, more quirky songs.The songs are catchy, but just dont compete with the quality of Townshend's lyrics. It may be unfair to judge his solo career against The Who, but there it is.I do however still greatly enjoy this CD and listen to it often.(Thus the 3 star rating despite all my complaining)It's more light and fun than his work with The Who, and i personally would enjoy listening to Roger sing just about anything. I do wish he had chosen some different song styles, but he was trying to stay as far away from Who-sounding music as possible.My favorites are the upbeat 'One Man Band', the softer 'Giving it all away', the more Who-like 'Free Me', his biggest hit 'Without your Love', and finally the Townshend penned 'After the Fire'."
4,Good,This second edition is one of the best treaties on the issue of sexual disorders that I have ever read. Completed by the first edition this pack is something that you not want to miss. A great book that does disappoint in some areas[...].
2,Fred the not so Great,Book was a dull read. No insight to the man and why he did what he did. Not very good story telling.
1,Waste of money and time,"I am sorry to say this but this book is total waste of time and money.First, as other reviews state if you wish to use the book for listening, speaking, writing and other tests provided you need to buy additional CD which is more expensive than book itself. The CD you originally get with book is just a set of additional exercises you don't really need.Secondly, which is also the most important, book claims to provide effective strategies to master TOEFL exam. Unfortunately, you just get a bunch of copy&paste; instructions. Moreover, presented examples are outdated and easier than on the real exam and do not reflect realistic picture.Fortunately, this book was not my only source of learning. If you are looking for effective TOEFL strategies, you will find a plentiful of them on youtube.com Just type for example TOEFL iBT Speaking question 1 - and for free!! My favorite contributors were NoteFulldotcom and RebeccaESL.I wish I had read others reviews before making a purchase!"
4,Toefl iBT,Many questions are asked as a run on sentence. Students would lose time by trying to understand and answer the questions.
2,I have to agree with previous posts concerning CDset,"Well I have also had to read the listening,speaking and writing parts of the book in the end in answers.and it's not the same as to listen to it as I'll have to do on my TOEFL test:(The CD accompanieing the book was very good but only after I staretd to do some listening parts I noticed on the back of the book that there should be 8 more CD disks.And as I opened the CD already.I mean I torn the envelope with CD I coudln't even return the book.The book itself seems to be a very good one.But without 8 more CDset it's not such a good preparational material for listening, writing and speaking sections.And I need to train mainly in speaking, writing and listening."
3,Could be 5 stars,"Hi everbodyThis new book is great, but doesn,t say anything that we need audio CD to study the listening, reading/writing integrated tasks, neither in book cover or in amazon site . And this audio CD have been out of stock in editor. So we can not profit in totally of this book!! So I just give 3 stars instead of 5afpires"
5,Longman Preparation Course for the TOEFL(R) Test : Next Generation (iBT),"REALLY it's an excellent book for iBT TOFEL preparation with full examples, skills, and magnificent CD-ROM to help anyone to get higher grade in iBT TOFEL exam."
3,It is really helpful,"I bought this book , it includes everything u need to study for the toefl ibt exam but the problem you need to get the 8 cds which are really hard to find and they are more expensive than the book whithout these cds the book is really useless."
1,Way too easy and inaccurate!,"This book has a ton of practice material and a very well-organized CD-ROM, but it's not nearly challenging enough for anyone who would like to achieve anything higher than 80 on the TOEFL iBT. I'll recommend this book to someone who is very low level and wants a score of around 60. This book is usually quite expensive, and that's not the worst part! The worst part is that Speaking Tasks 3, 4, 5, 6 and the Integrated Writing are not really representative of what test-takers will actually see on the real TOEFL iBT. In other words, these parts are inaccurate. You're much better off withOfficial TOEFL iBT Tests with Audio (Educational Testing Service)or withOfficial Guide to the TOEFL Test With CD-ROM, 4th Edition (Official Guide to the Toefl Ibt)."
5,Longmann Course for TOEFL,An excellent book to pass TOEFL. Use the CD and pay attention to all the exercises and you will not have any problem in taking real TOEFL test.
1,"This book is excellent, if it comes with audio CD","The price for the book is not bad, but it doesnt become complete book unless accompanied with Audio CD, so the total price of book would become around $110 which is very very expensive.The author should have included audio cd with the book."
3,Toefl+student book,"I bought this book 5 weeks ago. It is not so bad, but there is a problem. There is no Audio CD, only CD-ROM which doesn't cooperate with book . Therefore you will not have the listening part ."
2,Audio CDs are fundamental,"I think that this book is useless without audio cds (except for reading section).I'm Italian student; i would like audio cds, but it seems impossible to get them (because i live in Italy; in Pearson site the shipping is only to US addresses).How can i get them????I hope amazon sells cds soon!"
3,Look here for the AUDIO CD,"Hello,everybody.I went through hell for those CDs.I hate it that they are not sold with the textbook.And it took me a week to find a way to buy them.Every bookstore I tried either didn't have them at all or were sold out.So for everybody searching for those Cds you can call the publishers and order with them.The number is 1 800 428 5331.Another weird thing.On the back cover of the textbook it says that there are 8 Cds,and i just hang up with the publishers,they've told me that the CDs are 6.Good luck to everybody.P.S I got the CDs.They ARE 8,so i guess they made a mistake on the phone."
3,Sadly missing--the Audio cassettes or CD's!,"What a disappointment! This otherwise excellent book, is marred by not including the audio casettes or Cd's. To improve one's ability in listening and speaking , one must listen and imitate a variety of authentic native speakers!The book should be sold together with its corresponding audio program in one bundle!"
5,Printer Ink,"Just your average printer ink. I got the ""A"" version because it can be refilled at our local tech shop for $10/$15. :)"
4,Previous review is flawed,"In reading the first review posted here, most is misguided, misleading, or just wrong.However, this statement is completely false:""The trouble is that online gambling is illegal in most of the United States. ""Online gambling is illegal in the few specific states that have prohibited it (Nevada, New Jersey, and a few others). This definitely does not make up the majority of the US.I would think that Amazon would have a policy against posting false statements in a review."
2,First OXO I have not liked,You cannot turn an egg with this. The surface is not 100% smooth and hangs when you go under the egg. If you just want to turn burgers then it is great
5,Awesome little tool,"After buying one of these little guys, I bought 6 more ... one for each of my daughters and 2 more for myself... the best little spatula every made..."
3,"Looks good, but head warped = ugly","I wish I'd spent the money (not much, admittedly) on a thin-blade metal spatula. After its initial washing in the dishwasher, the blade is curving down, more or less evenly. Not what I wanted. Spatula blades ought to be FLAT, not kind of flat.Kind of a disappointment."
5,One of a Kind!,"Linda Eder is not in any way a Barbra S. (WANNABE)She stands alone in many ways,her range, the pure tone of her voice,her versatility in doing a wide range and type of songs.The so called critics of this extremely talented LADY are clearlyshowing there envy because they can't display any talent of their ownso they critic the ones who do."
3,Home Improvement projects,I bought several of the B&D books and they are helpful but they routinely copy items from the other books. The bathroom book and plumbing book share alot of the same content - disappointing when you purchase two books but you are only getting 1 1/2 of new material.
4,Great book for getting started,"This book is just right for those who are considering a bathroom remodeling project, to determine the scale of the work they want to undertake and to decide whether to do it themselves or hire a contractor. The instructions are clear and precise for basics, but for advanced work, a beginner will need more information."
3,good for ideas,I have been tiling for over 15 years and some of the applications were out dated when I started. This book is ok for some ideas but Nothing great.
5,louise,My son-in-law had this to help him remodel his bathroom and recommended it highly. We borrowed it for a few days and decided we had to have our own copy to guide us along on our two bathroom remodels planned for this winter. We have already learned much.
4,a good record,"it's a shame this disc was ignored.this disc has great moments such as the name of love,revolution which features Phillip's son rapping.the powerful tributes to Mumia abu-Jamal&Geronimo Pratt.cruising is a smooth ballad by Phillip.i first heard it in Spike Lee's Get on the bus film.this is there best disc since the eternal box set.i await the new disc.this is still the greatest group ever.the horns and the genius of Mr.Maurice White are all there."
4,Dog Shampoo,"This is a good shampoo,but it does not keep them smelling good for long. I would not reccommend it, like it was reccommend to me."
4,A tender romance with true feeling!,"I found this book very tender. The characters were together since childhood but parted when they were 17 years old, after a night of lovemaking.I wasn't very happy with the male character. I feel the female gave too much of herself and received so little in return. This made her seem weak. This made her seem foolish. This was the only downfall of the book."
5,Such a Useful Book to Own!!!,"Recovery of Your Self-Esteem: A Guide for Women is a must have if you are a woman who struggles with self-love. Hillman does a great job of reaching women on a personal level. This book contains secrets of things one can do to raise their self-esteem. I had never heard of this book until I found it on Amazon. One can attend self-help meetings, speak with professional counselors, journal thoughts and feelings on a daily basis, and do countless other things to raise their self-esteem. If you or someone you know struggles with low self-esteem, do yourself or them a huge favor and buy a copy of this book. It truly is a hidden treasure on how to love yourself. I found my copy for dirt cheap on Amazon and it was delivered in great condition just eight days later."
5,Return to Paradise,"I first heard the song ""Jing Jing"" at the beginning of the movie ""Return to Paradise."" I immediately had to find out the title of the song and the group. I hunted down this CD and I am am so glad I bought it. The chorus of voices is so beautiful and the songs are very upbeat and cute. The album is a nice mix of Okinawan pop, traditional sounds, and reggae (sort of)."
3,"It is quite frail, but pretty","This is a very pretty pair of earrings. The color is a little lighter than the picture, but I expected that. The length and size is quite nice, however, and the earrings look great on. Some things that drove the rating down.1. The stones are lighter than in the picture. I didn't mind this so much since I got it on sale, but others might.2. You'll need to get plastic backings for the posts. They will probably fall off the ear if one isn't careful. Or bend the posts to fall more tightly. The gold is pretty flexible.3. The chain linking is quite fragile. To be honest, one of the earrings arrived broken. I have some experience working at a Jewelry store, so I was able to conduct appropriate repairs. It's nothing that a good pair of jewelry pliars and some delicate manipulation couldn't fix. If you don't feel confident doing this, however, these are not the earrings for you."
1,ear rings,took over 2 months to get the product. it was a tangled mess when it arrived and took 45 minutes to get untangled. not a very good value either. CHEAP looking !!
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"The jewels are lovely but, hanging off of a flimsygold wire. (?) I wasted no time sending them back.If the jewels were hanging off of a 10k gold orgold on sterling silver wire/chain it would havebeen a nice pair of earrings. I failed to readthe reviews before purchasing. Also too lightweight to be real jewels or 14K gold wire. (??)"
2,Lose earrings frequently?,"I wouldn't pay good money to have the potential to lose one or both earrings because the ear wire is not secure. It is better to purchase earrings with locking ear wires, that is if you plan on keeping them for any length of time."
2,Disappointing,This book is not a futuristic romance as the cover states but is a fantasy that had some great ideas but didn't deliver. The demons and the magic are disapointingly downplayed and there is verylittle dialogue making this a dull read. The couple are okay people but didn't engage my emotions END
5,highly recommended,"If you want some worship music that is lite and relaxing than I highly recommended this. This is a very nice hymn collection. I don't think I will ever get tired of listening to this album. It will be a wise investment.I play this on my 30gb zune player, both my desktop and notebook computer and of course in my car."
5,Red Sovine,"This is a great cd. Especially for the older listeners. It has very touching songs on it. I am not old, and I listened to with my mother for hours."
1,Dangerous!,"Releasing the Spirit is a disappointing arguement for the triune nature of man. Shankle consistently takes the scriptures out of context in order to support his 'new revelation' of the human spirit, soul, and body. Perhaps the most deceptive and dangerous aspect of the book is it's focus on personal revelation and a metaphorical use of scripture to build it's arguements. While Shankle's system of thought is consistent and fits well within it's own framework, the lack of Biblical, linguistic, and historic foundations makes it a philosophy best avoided."
4,If you like the picture on the cover you'll like this book.,"This is an adorable booklet but I rated it 4 out of 5 because it is very small - only about 4x6 inches. The back cover says:""Included are 26 brightly colored stickers of fairies, flowers, and animals, along with a laminated background illustration of a forest clearing beside a shining lake. By arranging and rearranging the reusable stickers on the background, you can create many different enchanted worlds of your very own.""The picture on the front cover reflects half of the inside picture, and the fairies shown are three of the actual stickers. I hope you enjoy this product."
3,Okay for the price,"This is a cute, LITTLE sticker book. It's small and has stickers that kids can reuse on the inside page. It's not going to keep them entertained long because there's only so much they can do, but it's good for a quick diversion. I purchased a couple different of these sticker books for when I was taking a long airplane trip with my 2 and 4 year old. The price and size made them perfect for sticking in their travel bags and pulling out on the plane when they started getting antsy and needed something new to keep them entertained for a little bit."
5,Fantasic Piece of Writing,"I'd never heard of Stan Monaghan before, but the warmth of the cover just pulled me in right away. And thank goodness I didn't let go.The book has an honest way about it. It isn't rushed. The writing seems almost effortless, allowing a string of wonderfully vivid passages to evolve freely. And the characters have an every-man quality that I love. They're Irish. They're Canadian. They're human. Ultimately, the book left me feeling a real kinship with the Reilly family.It's a real winner (in my book)."
2,14k Yellow Gold Emerald Earrings,I was disappointed when I received these earrings. The emeralds were cloudy and very small. I returned them.
5,Visit The Old Neighborhood,"I love Lowell Streiker's book The Old Neighborhood. Simply and honestly written, it's a wonderful, funny and moving book about childhood in Chicago. In stories about the frozen fire hydrant and the endless paper route that range from mom, movies and gardens to Howdy Doody, daydreaming in school and Norton the Nemesis, Lowell Streiker reminds us of the joy, pain, innocence and complications of being a kid in times that we all know in our bones. Movies, religion, snails, kool-aid stands, parents, grandparents--it's all covered in short, funny, often profound passages that move to the heart of being an American child in post World War Two years. These pages took my Chicago mom back to her own childhood neighborhood world. If you've ever been a child (whether or not you've lived in Chicago)you will love this book."
4,That's the sound,"This album features instrumental versions of well known songs, played entirely on power tools. This is really funny stuff. Can you imagine ""I Will Always Love You"" being played on a chainsaw? You probably can't, so you need to get this CD to hear it. Recommended to fans of novelty music."
3,i guess its good for kids,"if you have a child, they would have fun with it, but i dont think i found much of the interesting stuff for myself."
3,perspective draw 3-d book,this book was to vague for me. I have read other books about perspective so i am fimiliar with perspective terms. I would not advise someone who is just beginning to learn about perspective purchase this book as a first one.
5,My review,"This is a very fun to use book, with detailed and specific explanations and easy to apply examples, so that, by the end of the reading, you can do some things on your own that look very real."
4,Draw 3D,"This book was purchased for an 8 year old. The instructions are good, detailed and easy to understand. It uses some drawing terms and gives ideas of what to make after telling you how to make the different shapes. Both my 6 year old and 8 year old were able to use it with success."
3,An eclectic mix,"This book contains a good deal of information about numerous facets of social anxiety, but doesn't really tie everything together. As such, the book doesn't present any kind of a program -- hence ""working through"" in the title may be a little misleading. I found myself wishing the author would dig a little deeper at times, and other times found her a bit too eager to apply disparate theories from other fields to treating social anxiety. But she does assemble a lot of practical information (such as her section on insurance coverage), most of it quite up to date, and so this book may be very useful as a reference. The anecdotes she relates are dead-on."
5,Release from captivity,"In my family we did not talk about personal difficulties and mental disorder was the ultimate dirty word. So I have struggled with my social anxieties alone, wearing a social mask so no one would know the truth and reject me. I have been trapped like an animal in a leghold trap, slowly dying in excruciating pain and indescribable fear. This book opened the jaws of that trap for me and is mending my wounds. I know now that I am not alone, that millions of others suffer from my problem and that there is help and hope for us all."
5,The answers are here,"For years I have sought the one cause of my social anxiety disorder. I thought if only I could discover it, my social fears would disappear. Diagonally-Parked showed me that my frantic search was dooming me to frustration and failure. Even if there were ""one"" cause (which there isn't), I found out that knowing it wouldn't do anything to help me function in my present life. While insight about the past is useful, it is not essential to feeling better in the present. What I need to do is work on my thoughts and behaviors as they exist now and this is what I'm doing with the help of this super book. What a big relief."
3,Mixed Review,"First of all, this book is very badly edited. It has many comical typos, weirdly condensed diagrams, a discouragingly dense layout, and somewhat unclear writing. It also crams in as much information as possible, ranging from the repetitive and unhelpful, to the coincidentally useful, to the salient.Nonetheless, it's still worth reading. Or skimming through to find relevant sections, anyway. There is so much in this book that some of it is bound to be useful and validating. Although I have not yet gotten any other books on this subject, there do not seem to be many lay books on Social Anxiety, so this one may still be the best at the moment."
4,Helpful and worthwhile,"This 400 page book on social anxiety gives a good overview of the subject, indepth coverage of therapeutic choices, and discussion of relevant topics not generally covered. I have found the exercises on dealing with arousal, thoughts and beliefs, and avoidance behaviors very useful but wish the book could have been more workbooklike. Unfortunately in reality that would have made the book huge and not one I would have picked up. There is a good balance between technical and personal information. While there is a lot of information it is easy to read. I like the author's own anecdotes as well as other people stories. The book is ambitious, trying to give the reader some of everything needed to start recovery. No book on social anxiety is perfect but I give this one good marks for not only what it is trying to do but what it does."
1,reader,"Way to much time spent talking about theories. The advice seem to miss the mark for me.I recommend ""Dying of Embarrasment"""
5,Provides a much needed kick in the pants,Getting motivated to do something about SA/SP is very tough. My problem has been that I want to change but at the same time I don't. Change means risk and I don't much like risk. But this book helped me see the pluses and minuses of changing and staying the same so I could work through my ambivalence. Then it showed me how to deal with risk and make decisions. The author's strong but gentle guidance is just what I needed to help me jump start my motivation to get me working on my recovery.
5,Very useful life strategies,Because of my social anxiety I avoid shopping. I feel embarrassed everyone can see my anxiety. When a clerk approaches me my mind always goes blank and I become tongue tied. I know they will think I am nervous because I want to steal something and that humiliates me and makes me even more anxious. With the guidance of this book I am gaining confidence that I will be able to go to stores and malls without fear.
2,Not impressed,"I reviewed this book looking for material that would be helpful for patients who are suffering from social anxiety disorder. The book is poorly written, badly edited, and seems to go off topic many times in a seemingly effort to fill pages. It has some good information, but it would not be my first pick for seeking educational or support help."
1,Do not buy this book!,"Do not buy this book at all! I bought this book looking at the stars rating listed on the site. But it actually causes the anxiety to increase. Because the ways of overcoming given here are not realistic and cannot be used directly. For example the book just says that you need to dress well, listen to what other person is saying, do not worry, do not get scared etc. Even I know I don't wanna get scared and worry but I just can't help it! It comes naturally. Trust me, the only thing that works is The 20 tape CBT series by Dr. Richards. Its the best money you'd ever spend."
2,Unhelpful,"I think this book misses the mark by equating social phobia(SP)with social skills and advising sufferers of SP of techniques to use in social situations. Social phobia has nothing to do with social skills; i suffer at times from social phobia and people generally describe me as being relaxed and natural in social situations. In fact, when I tell them of my problem they don't believe me. Inside however, I am a wreck and dread many situations, imagining I am going to act hysterically and go out of control. Books like this, in my opinion, misrepresent the condition for people who don't have SP but would like to understand it. For those with SP, it is not helpful either - I recommmend seeing a doctor or a psychotherapist who is well versed in cognitive techniques, not a book about what to say at a party. If you are simply nervous at parties and don't know how to act, that is NOT social phobia."
2,Same Info - Different Package,"All the books in the world can't change a chemical imbalance in your brain. I have a bookshelf full of thistype of material and tried for 10 years to ""cure"" myself.The answer was far simpler....SSRI drugs.I resisted for years. Drugs?! No way, they're for nuts.Now I can see that as one of the multitude of bad thoughts I had when I was perpetually anxious.Talk to your doctor, not your bookseller."
5,Builds your self-confidence and motivates you,"This book really does have ""everything"" AND it really is ""smart and funny"". But the reason I especially like it is because it showed me that I'm okay, that SP is only a part of me, not ""all"" of me or the ""real"" me or some external monster to battle to the death. Once I accepted SP as simply a way of thinking and behaving that I wanted to change, like using the wrong fork at dinner, I stopped wasting all that energy jousting at windmills and being so furious with myself for having SP. That's when my recovery began. After five months I'm doing lots better. I guess I could even say I ""like"" me now and that really feels so good."
4,Good if you're really serious about recovery,"If you want a small simple book on SA/SP this isn't it. This isn't a book you read in an afternoon. It isn't a few pages on SA/SP and a handful of exercises. It's 408 pages! This book says it wants you to know everything you need to know to be successful in recovering, like preparing for recovery. At first I thought who needs this. Get on with the exercises. But it became clear to me as I read why more understanding of SA/SP and preparing gives you a better chance at getting better. Now I think this is a very smart book because of how it makes you think and works with ALL the big problems us SA/SPs suffer from."
5,You have to read this,"Clear and well-organized, this book is loaded with useful and inspiring material. It's like a college course in a book that's surprisingly fun to read."
4,Solid Techniques,"This book is different from most self-help books because it offers solid self-help techniques instead of just explaining the psychology and background behind the disorder. Author Dayhoff isn't just an observer of SA/SP, she's been there too. I would have rated this book a 5 because I actually improved after reading it, but I had to give it a 4 for two reasons: one, the book seems a bit disorganized so it's hard to retain all the information without constantly re-reading; and two, because she uses psychology terminology that you would not understand unless you had at least one course in General Psychology. But don't let that stop you from reading it if you suffer from SA/SP, because it really is helpful."
5,Very easy for beginners,This book has helped my wife a lot in understanding the english grammar beside her real life english course. The audio CDs are very practical way to practice both listening and writing. I strongly recommend it for any english learning beginner. No need for any instructor.
3,Very good Book but no answers,I really like this book a lot. Very good excercises with examples. But biggest disadvantage is that there are no answers. When i do my excercises there are no answers to correct it. Answers are so close that you need to have answers to correct them
2,Ok to be basic but not that way,"isnt a good book, cause even the basic is out of this book, ahrd to get it, the exemples are no clear and you get tired of it in few minutes, what the science use to call; lazy brain. but if you want try it dont blame me later , cause i told you so"
3,Door Stops R Us,"This weighty tome would put most loaves of bread to shame. The cover blurb proclaims ""Anarchy, Sex Pistols, Punk Rock, and Beyond."" What it really is, is an obsessively detailed work about the Sex Pistols, with punk as a background theme. Several chapters are mired in minutiae that really should have stayed in Savage's research folder, and the repetitive deeper meanings that the he reads into things such as song lyrics, clothing, and behavior are often embarrassingly psuedo-academic. What disappointed me most about the book, was the abrupt ending and the feeling it left of lack of closure. Oddly enough though I largely enjoyed reading the book, since it was often a pleasant trip down memory lane, but I could have enjoyed it far more it had lived up to the lofty claims of the cover."
4,England's Dreaming,"I sought out this book because past reviews I'd read had said it accurately captured the feel of England in the late 1970s. This it does as well as provide an entertaining read, no mean feat for a 600-plus page tome on the birth of the English punk rock movement.Irony abounds. The Sex Pistols, a ragtag group of petty criminals and anarchist wannabes, pressed just one album and five singles in their brief history yet gave rise to the punk movement and became national icons. The group was the spin-off of a clothing store and thus, a group nominally devoted to anarchy was in fact, a marketing ploy.All the rest are here as well. Siouxsie and the Banshees. The Clash. Recommended. Holds your interest despite a length absurd for the subject at hand."
1,Not an overview of Britpunk.,"Horribly padded. No narrative flow. Not an overview of Britpunk. Just 540 tedious pages devoted to the short career of the Sex Pistols with an occasional paragraph on other bands. Check out ""Riot of our Own"" and ""Rotten"" first."
1,Its Long winded and boring.,"Its long winded and boring (it does pick up after the first 150 pages...) If you really really really love the sex pistols, and are obessed with tiny little facts about their manager, and their lifes, then this book is for you. If want to know more about the punk movement, anarchy and beyond don't read this book."
3,"Filling, But Not really So Great!","This Book is Now Considered a ""Definitive"" Sourch for the Origins of the Punk Rock Movement, as it was Written by someone ""Who Was There"" Well, Its Trys to be Soooo Intellectual it Usually Misses the Point of the Whole Movement! I Usually Turn to Better & more Entertaining Books of the Era. Jon Savage is so much like Malcolm Mclaren it becomes an egotistical set of Opinions rather than a Well rounded tome. Sometimes just the Humorless-ness comes through. There are also many Holes where many a Group, People, or Event has fallen into, perhaps Never to be seen again... I hope there will be Many more books of this Very Exciting & Very Viable time of Rock'n'Roll, but not only to prevent this from being that Only ""definitive"" source. It Would be Great to see a London Version of Please Kill Me Oral History! I have come to Dread seeing Jon's name on CD Liner Notes & Magazine Articles!"
4,Pretty Good New Wave Collection of Women Artists,I will give this cd four stars because the songs on here are really good. It is a nice collection of female new wave artists. The main issue is if you have bought other new wave collections in the past then you will probably run into some very familiar songs on this collection. Most of the songs on this cd were played heavily on the radio and on MTV back in the 1980's so you will probably hear a lot of old favorites here. The only song on this collection that I don't like is the last one by Laurie Anderson. I just have always hated that song. It really grates on my nerves. There are some very cool liner notes included that give some nice trivia of all of the artists that you may or may not already know.
5,"Works fine, no issues.","I noticed there are currently a couple other poor reviews for this valve. I just wanted to mention that I installed one of these about 2 years ago and we have had no problems at all with it. Installation is no different than any other standard thermostatic valve and the plumber had no problems installing it. We've had no issue with it not keeping perfectly constant water temperature, it's always perfectly contant. But your experience with it may vary if you have extreme issues with undersized pipes."
3,"Great once it's installed, but installation will baffle you and your plumber","This valve works great at holding the water temperature once it's installed.But beware of the installation. The instructions are horrible and baffling. And most plumbers won't even bother to read the instructions, which means that you'll get something that's miscalibrated and whose temperature range will be limited.It took my plumber 2 tries, each lasting a couple hours, with a 3 hour call to Kohler in between.If you're going to use this, buy it from a Kohler store and get them to recommend a plumber that they know for certain has installed it before."
5,Carry On Is An AWESOME Album,"With Carry On, Pat Green continues to record spectactular, good-ol' Texas music. His newest album reveals the pride of Texans and what it means to grow up in such a great state. I highly recommend this album; it's one-of-a-kind!"
3,Not the best album he has had.,"Pat Green's album ""Carry On"" isn't his best work, but a nice album none the less. I agree with other reviewers who say it doesn't deserve the bad rating that it is getting. It is most defiantly worth more the some of the one star reviews that it has gotten. My favorite track on the album is ""Ruby's Two Sad Daughters"" That track alone is worth the price of the album IMHO. Happy listening!"
3,"Good, not great","Pat Green continues to turn out quality songs. I like most of the songs on this album, and so will most Pat Green fans. I think this album lacks a good mixture of songs though. Nearly all of the songs have the same tempo and flow, there is not enough to break up this flow and it does get monotonous. So nothing wrong with the songs individually, but as a whole they don't seem to fit well."
1,i'll be as repetitive as pat green,1 word: boring.Want two words? Very boring.Want three words. Very very boringGet the picture?
1,Future Nashville Star?,"For a guy that says he despises Nashville, he sure is starting to sound as cheesy as those guys. The only good song on this CD is the title song. Everything else is garbage. Stick with his old stuff, it's much better."
5,A really great TV set,"I won't beat a dead horse here by posting another redundant review. I completely agree with Christopher Lee (The Beast) and have had the same experiences and made similar adjustments. I wouldn't trade this TV set for any other out there. My only complaint was that the TV will not accept anything better than 1080i through the component inputs, which astounds me. I could find nothing that would have indicated this to me prior to my purchase. First generation XBox 360 users should take note of this. I've changed my 360 out for a later model with HDMI (great reason for an upgrade!), so no problems now and I'm rockin' 1080p content."
5,Awesome!,This TV is Awesome! Easy to set up and displays beautiful 1080p pictures! It has Several features that are handy (like the source labels). Very glad I purchased the products and AMAZON ROCKS!
5,Sony Bravia,"I just finished watching the New England Patriots/Giants game in HD and the picture on this Sony was absolutely beautiful. The purchase process from Amazon was hassle free and Eagle deliverd the set within minutes of the promised time. My only (minor) issue was that they only sent one delivery person, so he and I had to unload the set from the back of the truck and bring it into the house. I am very happy with this purchase and everyone who has seen this set has commented on the beautiful picture."
5,"Great TV, great delivery","My new Sony KDL-46V2500 46"" Bravia V-Series 1080p LCD HDTV meets all my expectations. The delivery by Amazon using Eagle Transport exceeded my expectations. I ordered my TV set on November 27 and one week later it was delivered to my home in extreme south Texas. The delivery person unpacked the set, put it on our stand, hooked it up and turned it on and then programmed it. Then he helped me carry my old heavy 32"" tube set out to my storage shed. What more could a person expect?"
5,"Beautiful color, true blacks and sharp picture","I spent about 3 months researching before buying the 46V2500. It's a manageable size and weight for a 46"" set. It has 2 HDMI inputs and it would be nice at times to have 3.The color balance right out the box was good, it only required a little fine tuning. Everything looks good on it, regular cable, standard DVD's and BluRay 1080p discs. I have it hooked up to a TIVO 3 HDDVR and a BluRay player. Everything looks sharp and there is no blurring with action scenes as is the case with some LCDs.The built in speakers are better than average, but I would recommend a 5.1 external system, it makes a big difference."
5,Superb,"I looked at dozens of TVs. I also compared how they looked with a regular digital/cable signal and not just a HD signal (I had the TV guy shift the whole store to a standard digital signal from HD signal) and this is where you'll see that this TV stands apart from the rest. Apparently Sony uses some type of filtering technology to clean up the non-HD signals. Keep in mind we still have a few years to go before everything will come across in HD.I can't imagine anyone not being happy with this TV.. Even the speakers sound nice.Amazon shipped Eagle freight. What a great experience I had with them. They called the night before delivery, two guys arrived 10 minutes early, carried the giant box up a flight of stairs, and even offered to help me unpack the TV and take away the box!"
5,Perfect!,"I have had a year now and could not ask for more. Add the price was great from Amazon, no tax and free shipping. Delivery company was awesome. Took it up the stairs in my house and told me to keep the box just in case. Got it one week after ordering. Whole purchase was a no brainer. Now I just got my Sony Blu Ray to go with it. There is no other.......when it comes to Sony."
4,"Good, but with a catch","I like this TV, but keep in mind it only has one HDMI connection. If you have a HD-DVR, that takes up the only HDMI connection. If you get another component (Blue Ray) that needs a HDMI port, you are out of luck. Great price on Amazon for this unit."
4,Awesome TV,"We looked at several TVs before ""settling"" on this one. In fact, at one time I had the 46XBR2 available for a comparable price. I thought this TV was a lot more compact (bottom-mounted speakers) and got this one. I am very pleased with the picture quality not just for HD but also for SD. I live in the Chicago area and the HD quality for WTTW is jaw-dropping.Some ""bugs"" in this TV - can't turn on closed-captioning with one button and haven't found a setting yet in which CC turns on when I put the TV on mute. Can't believe this feature is not in this TV - my Toshiba from 6 years ago had it.I saw this TV hooked up with a Blu-Ray player and I couldn't believe theamazing picture quality."
1,Why did you sell me an old out of date version,I just bought this product new two weeks ago. Why did you sell me an out of dated product. You have already sent me a message promoting Elements 4.0. You should upgrade me to 4.0 at no charge. I had no intention of buying a product that would be replaced in two weeks. I am an angry customer.
1,Frustratingly SLOW,"I was a user of Version 2 and purchased version 3 with great anticipation, especially as I had downloaded the trial version of Album.What a disappointment!!! I have not even bothered to explore any of the new features of either the Elements or Album as the product runs like a sick dog.I will be uninstalling this product and returning to version 2 until the new version is improved. It is currently unworkable even though my computer exceeds the minimum requirements for the product.This is not one of Adobe's better product releases."
2,Only for the digitally educated folks,I bought this product because it had such great reviews and it appeared to meet all my needs. I have had it over 6 months now and I still can't get the hang of it. It is NOT user friendly. I try to use all the help features but it takes so long to do just one little thing that by the time I am done editing one pic - I am burnt out and don't want to touch it for awhile.If you are already up to speed with this type of software - it is really cool - but for new users - stay away from it.
2,The Good the Bad and the Ugly,"Editor and organizier bundled together seems a good idea but I'm not sure version 3.0 has got it right. I was very pleased with version 2.0 although it had it's short comings.The Ugly is the time it takes this program to launch and to switch from organizer to editor. Every time you launch the program it tries to log onto the internet. Even when offline!The Bad is the Help system. There is very little information provided and you have to go online to get help! Does Adobe think all computing is done while we are connected to the internet.The Good is certainly worth waiting for. Improved cropping tool, healing tool and my favorite a one click red eye correction that really works. Despite the Bad and the Ugly I think this is a tool you need if you are working with digital images. I'm hopeful that Adobe will correct some of these problems with updates soon."
1,Feel like I've been ripped off,"Photoshop Elements 3.0 does not work properly on my computer. I've tried to contact Adode for technical support, but they do not provide free technical support. They charge $40 per question.Do not purchase products developed by Adobe. They are a waste of your money. The technology is great, but Adobe should support their products."
4,"Mail-in Rebate: Read the ""Fine Print""!","It appears by the ""Special Offer"" for a $20.00 rebate that this is available with the purchase of the software. However, you must read below at the bottom of the page where it says a $20 rebate is for ""upgraders"". Very misleading to the buyer of new software!"
5,PhotoShop elements is great.,The full PhotoShop is expensive and over the last 3 years we haven't found anything we couldn't do with PhotoShop elements. If you are a professional you probably want more but we have done a lot with Elements.
4,Almost a full-sized PS without the full-sized price,"I've used the 'real' Photoshop for a number of years professionally but was hesitant to pay the 'real' Photoshop price for home use. Elements 3 lacks the bells and whistles and uses some 'short cuts' that seem to me kind of crude but for 90% of folks E3 is more than adequate. I am very happy with E3. (Beware of what rebates maybe offered by Adobe, however. If offered, read the 'fine print' if there is fine print. I felt mislead but Amazon 'made good.')"
4,"Good, but not Great!","This really is a fine product from Adobe, but released a little early. Many of the problems have already been described and my biggest complaint is the transition time time between photoshop and the editor. However, once in any place the product does shine. The help section is OK. I noticed in JASC PSP 9.0 the help section will give you the option of letting the software do the 'show you'.All in all another good Adobe product I would recommend."
1,Adobe Elements 3.0,I was disappointed with Elements 3.0. I purchased it because I wanted to put more than 1 music selection with the slide shows that I made. It performed that function but the resolution of the slide shows suffered because of a 3rd party program that produced the slide shows on a VCD instead of a CD. My computer which is fairly new with Windows XP Home and a LCD monitor worked perfectly with Adobe Photoshop 2.0 and produced very sharp pictures. The new 3.0 does NOT work on my computer and will only work on a TV through a DVD player. The DVD player worked but the resolution of the pictures was very poor and could only show it on a TV. I think the selection of VCD is a mistake in 3.0.
4,Still learning Photoshop,I purchased Photoshop elements 3 in hopes to improve and hopefully simplify my photo editing/printing. I find that there are a lot of things to learn about this software to get the most from it. I like what I see so far and think it will be worth the time and trouble to educate myself.
2,Think Again Before Buying,"If you're not already familiar with PS Elements or other Photoshop products, you might need to reconsider buying PS Elements unless you're ready to spend alot of time learning to use it. A user's manual is not included and the Help is not very helpful unless you already know what you're doing. You will also need to buy a user's manual. Also, PS Elements is rather slow."
3,Adobe Elements 3,"For those who are upgrading from Adobe Photo Album 2.0 this program can be used to correctly import your catalog from Photo Album 2.0. Once this is done, one can upgrade to later versions of Photoshop Elements and the catalog will import to later versions correctly, at least up to Photoshop Elements 7."
4,on time,My product came on time and in the excellent condition it was described as. Overall it was a great experience with this seller.
5,Still the best entry level photo editing,"This version is substantially better than 2.0!* The photo organizer makes finding a particular photo easier. (though if you already have a great deal of digital images it takes a long time to get them all sorted)* A new feature called quick fix is great when it works. It tends to do better on outdoor pictures than indoor pics. If quick fix does not work another feature, auto levels, does a good job.* The spot-healing tool is great for removing facial blemishes and other small objects that need to be removed. I have actually been really amazed at how well it works. On some photos it even can remove unwanted faces.* The red eye correction is another easy to use tool that consistently works well. This red eye tool is the best one I have worked with.With all these automated tools editing pictures has become a whole lot easier."
5,Excellent first hand narrative,"This refers to the paperback edition. Robert Campbell joined Ashley's Fur Trade Expedition in 1825, and this little book gives his own account of his adventures in the American West up to 1835. Although Campbell is cited in many historical and biographical books, documents, manuscripts and journals, he has somehow eluded notoriety amongst the more famous mountain men and fur trappers of his day. After reading this book, one can easily see that he played a very significant role during this time period. Even though the book is only sixty pages, there are many interesting stories and events which Campbell relates to the reader. The historical notation and introduction are also well done."
3,Not much about commoners,"I was disappointed, mostly because I was interested in the how women of the Tudor period lived. The book gave very few details about the average woman, it was mostly about the queens of the period. I gave it 3 stars because what it did do, it did very well. It was a fast moving overview of the Royal Tudor women but there was very little depth."
4,Thalia,enjoyed the performance could of been a bit longer but over all it was great. something to watch on a weekday. melisa
2,Too much simplified training,"I am a bit disapponted about this book after all the reviews I have read. It is true that this book give you simple practice exercises to become a magician, but there are not ""secret exercises"". Everything I found in this book was not new to everyong has already read other book about magic.I will advice neophyte to start with Donald Michael Craig's books."
5,Yngwie returns with one of his best albums ever!!!!,"This is a great suprise that yngwie has delivered the goods on this album. After 2 previous disappointments ( alchemy and War to end all wars ) the production is now good and all instruments can be heard. Yngwie kicked Mark Boals who was a terrible singer and now has Doogie White on vocals who is a great singer. More mid range and power and this suits the style on this album.There are many great tracks on this album notably Rise Up and Attack, the instrumentals are also of a high quality.If you have been disappointed with yngwies recent output, suprise yourself and check out this album."
3,"It does the job, but there are better ones out there","I have two chalk bags, one of these, as well as a Mad Rock bag that I purchased from a local shop.The Black Diamond bag is a fine bag, but it's nothing special. The pull cord that is used to close the bag seems to fight you a little too much. It feels like the bag wants to stay open. In contrast, the Mad Rock bag closed quickly and smoothly with even the lightest tug.The Mad Rock bag has an adjustable waist belt with clasp that I really like, whereas this one just has a string that seems to only be useful for wearing around your neck.In my opinion, the adjustable waist strap is worth an extra couple of bucks, and I know Black Diamond sells some with that type of strap here on Amazon. I'd recommend going that route instead."
4,Natural Wood Blocks,"They are very nicely designed; simple and leave alot to the imagination. One point though is their size. I think they are very good for an older 4 year old with excellent hand eye coordination; they are not as big as the Childcraft or others you may find in preschools around the country. For articulate builders and beginning architects with fine motor skills, these are just fine !!"
5,The closer...,Fabulous!! Another great season. THe only negative would be that there isn't enough episodes!! By the time you are finished watching the last episode you have to wonder how the poor woman survived this season!! Can't wait until next season!
5,Great Dramatic/Comedy series,"Once you've started, you'll find it hard to stop. Watching these great videos is like a narcotic. You just want to be injected with another one, and another. Then when they are all done you have to go through a withdrawal phase of disappointment that there aren't another 100 to go.Great fun, edge of your seat humor and drama combined. Every actor fits the part perfectly and the bad guys are bad and the dead people are really dead. The star, Kyra Sedgwick, is outstanding and never lets you down."
4,Great cast and stories!,I watch this show almost everynight fighting the temptation to stay up all night viewing a whole season!!! I will not like it when I run out of episodes to watch!!!
5,I Love this show!,Being able to watch the season without waiting for the next episode rocks! :-) Onto the next season. I hope they are all on Prime.
2,Decent Season - terrible finale!,"Overall, Season three wasn't as strong as the first two. But what really disappointed was the 2-episode ""season finale"". It had more plot holes, ridiculous ""that couldn't happen"" moments than all the episodes in Seasons 1-3 put together. I won't use spoilers, but the entire road trip from Atlanta, ""interrogation"" of the prisoner, wiring of a criminal, stakeout and execution at the end (under a car - REALLY?), motivations of the parties involved - all rubbish and could never happen at any level of police work. Not sure whether it is the writers or director fault, but too much expediency and not enough reality (for a ""reality drama""). Hope upcoming seasons are more like 1 & 2 and less like #3."
4,Can we hope for more extras?,"I have loved The Closer since its first episode, but the DVD sets have next to nothing in supplemental material and extras. While Season 3 was as good as the first two, if not better, it would sure be nice to see something above and beyond a 12-episode season for this price. For that matter, I wish they would make the seasons longer to begin with!"
5,Forensic Buff,She is the best as usual. Good blend of characters. It is very entertaining. The best.
5,"Thank yew, thank yew very much!","My husband and I do not watch much TV, especially commercial TV, so when a program can capture us to the extent that we are willing to make it part of our busy schedule, it goes without saying that it is a great show. The acting is supberb, as well as the writing. It blends humor with solving crime. The show has a little office romance but not to the absurd lengths other programs delve into...(I say this because we have quit watching other shows that became soap operas).The chemistry of the actors and the building of the character loyalty has grown over the seasons. My husband and I like the show so much that I have purchased each season as soon as it comes on DVD and enjoy rewatching old shows. The best part is that when I recommend it to friends who have never heard of it and I loan them my DVD's, then they become fans and we can talk about the antics of the crime squad and what dumpster Brenda might dive into next time....Thank yew....thank yew very much!"
5,Check this out!!!,"this show knows off my socks...better than my longtime favorite""BONES"".one major differance is that the Closer is set where its shot."
5,Great video,"I received the video faster than expected, and it was in great condition. Enjoyed watching it."
5,great,loved it couldnt stop watching it had a blast with it an i loved furzz if that is how to spell his name
1,1.2 pounds of pure dreck,"I NEVER throw away a book, especially before I've finished, until ""Chasers."" The dialogue in this book is probably the worst I've ever read; every character sounds the same, they all take two paragraphs to speak a simple thought and the dialogue is so stilted it sounds like Shakespearean actors doing a SNL skit. Laughably bad. Try reading the dialogue aloud...Overall, I found ""Chasers"" to be frustrating to read, found myself grinding my teeth in parts. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone.For good crime fiction, try T. Jefferson Parker, Robt. Crais, the gteat Lee Child or any of a dozen more. This guy Carcaterra is a wanna be."
1,Contrived dialogue prevented me from reading anything past the first 100 pages.,Seriously. No one speaks like that. Not even in movies. I'm highly disappointed and expected more from Carcaterra.Reading Robert Harris - now THAT'S some storytelling.
2,Needs a better editor,"The action sequences are decent and I can even accept the dialogue. However, it's hard to get past the terrible editing. For example, this novel is set in 1985. One of the characters makes a reference to Mel Gibson's character in Lethal Weapon. That movie wasn't released until 1987. Apaches was a better book."
5,Perfect match for Hollister adhesive!!!!,"Bought this spray removal by mistake and was SO GLAD I did! We have been using removal wipes to help get Hollister adhesive off of skin after using it to secure Insulet Omnipod insulin delivery systems for 3 days. This spray makes the pods practically FALL OFF! Okay, you may have to gently pull the pod away from the skin, but it is a HUGE improvement over the removal pads and wipes. The vendor is quick to deliver without any issues. Strongly recommend this product paired with Hollister adhesive spray to secure and remove medical devices from skin that needs to stay on during stressful conditions such as swimming, surfing, sports, etc.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
4,Folksy murder,"Nellie Hand is a pleasant middleaged saleslady in a New York Village boutique, loved by all and trusted confidante of many. She lives modestly in an apartment block peopled by diverse Village characters, and numbers among her friends, people as varied as a president of a major corporation to a forger of well known paintings. Several plots unfold, improbable as they seem in such an innocuous setting--a young girl who is trying to hide a large amount of cash, the proceeds of a robbery, a man who confides in Nellie that he committed murder some years ago and Nellie herself, trying to spark a romance between a beautiful ex-model and her nephew. Her brutal murder stuns everybody as such a crime seems pointless. Her nephew, a well known photographer, begins to investigate her death and slowly a picture starts to form, incriminating friends who have no apparent reason to do her harm. It's a simple tale, filled with interesting characters."
1,Bland,"Orleans. England Dan & John Ford Coley. Paul Davis. Firefall. Ambrosia. Pablo Cruise. Seals and Crofts. What do these acts have in common? They all appeared in the 1970's, had three hits or so, continued to be played to death on ""soft rock less talk"" stations to this day, and were (and remain) virtually indistinguishable from each other. Perhaps those who like this mellow, 8-track/kickin' back type music would be best served by a compilation of soft seventies hits."
2,On: My life,"As mush as I love, and say that I love these widely experimental and new ways of looking at things, I cannot really work through the language presented as a dialogue to discuss these newer things. They can be looked at whimsically, and without much contrariness on the part of the reader. However, approaching Lyn Hejinian's My Life, I was hoping in fact for something more along the lines of a classical narrative, something that was decidedly missing in as I turned the pages. I was able to understand that she had a couple of kids, but seemingly never had sex.Quite honestly, I have no idea what Hejinian's life was like, and this novel/poem/chap book obscures any understanding that I might want to know, as the assertions in My Life are vague, repetitious, and quite frankly uninteresting."
3,Low Impact,"This abdominal exercise device comes with 6 seperate tension cords giving you 6 levels of resistence. As a low impact beginners device this serves the purpose. But if you are at any kind of advanced degree of abdominal fitness this device falls short. Even with increased repititions this does not provide enough resistence to help. Construction seems sturdy enough for daily use but it is hard to determine how well it stands up over time if highest tension is used. Overall, good for beginners."
3,"ehhh its alright, could have been better",I cannot say they were completely un useful but they should have come with better mounting hardware/longer mounting hardware. You have to basically drill/screw your speakers (if they arent the exact hole specifications) into the adaptor itself. I guess in itself it is not a bad thing but the design/hole placement/plastic is all kinda cheesy. For the need of it I would suggest it to another person but if there were a better alternative that I knew of I would not recommend it to another person.
2,Disappointing collection,"Maybe my hopes were just too high for this one. It sounds like a great idea, but I have to agree with Cyberalchemist. Holmes in no instance ever confronts the weaknesses in his deductive system, which is where the real drama should lie. Instead, he displays a ridiculous erudition concerning all things Lovecraftian, which makes for a series of predictable, boring denouements. Some of the stories are decent reads, but reading them one after another gets tiresome. No points for guessing how many times Holmes' cocaine is mentioned either. I think every single author had to throw that one in there, whether it was pertinent to the story or not."
3,Not bad,"This book tells different kind of stories including adventures, mysteries, thrills and horros. It could be because English is a foreign language to me or because I put too much expectation on it(I bought this book because I read A Study in Emerald in Chinese and this simple story impressed me), but while these stories are well told I did not find them impresive(as much as the first one). A few of them even make me think ""oh how could it be like this, this is not a Holmes story"". At mean time some of them make me thrill like real horror. So, not bad. But won't be my favourite, either."
4,Extremely high coolness factor,"Not every story is a gem, but most of them are very, very good. The less successful ones cleave too much to Holmesian or Lovecraftian conventions too closely, so they feel too much like a geeky in-joke. (The tiger hunt one definitely fits into this category for me, as does the re-animator pastiche.) If I had been the editors, though, I would have put the Neil Gaiman story at the end. It's a jaw-dropping stunner...worth savoring at the very, very end. If you can resist, save it until you're done with the rest of the book, even though it's the first story in this anthology.The coolness factor of mixing Lovecraft and Doyle is off the meter. I'm surprised no one had done it before--and I've read a lot of Lovecraftian fiction, and to a smaller extent, the modern Holmes riffs like The Seven Percent Solution. I wouldn't be surprised if the editors produce another volume soon, with the number of writers who'd like to try their hand at this literary hybrid."
3,Somehow it didn't click...,"As you can guess from the other reviews, there are mixed feelings about this book. You would think placing Sherlock Holmes in the same universe with the nightmares that are just under the surface of reality would be wonderful. At least there was a chance of him going crazy.While I did enjoy some of the stories, such as Nightmare In Wax by Simon Clarke, A Study In Emerald by Neil Gaiman, and The Drowned Geologist by Caitlin R. Kiernan which is set in Whitby, most of the stories seem bland and most of the authors seem to be fans of the same Lovecraft stories. Well, Tiger! Tiger! is interesting as Sherlock Holmes is NOT in it, most of the stories seem to repeat the same basic themes and, sometimes, use the same horrors.I would suggest checking it out of the library or getting it used."
4,a pretty good read,"I found this far better than the other lovecraftian spinoffs I've read. Better ideas, and better written treatments."
2,False Description,"I bought this tub spout because it stated it would fit a 4-1/2"" to 5"" nipple length. This is completely false. This tub spout can't fit a length longer than 4"" - 4-1/8th"". I'll try returning it and update this review with the results."
5,The Best Deodorant Stick,"I tried this deodorant a few years back, and then i found it on the internet and ordered 2 sticks, they lasted a long time. When i ran out i ordered it again, it is the best deodorant I have ever used. I am a very active woman and this deodorant does the job perfectly."
1,Don't waste your money,"After reading all the positive reviews, i thought I found the one. I was so pleased the first couple days of using it (didn't do much, went shoppping and chill at home). I work as a part-time waitress and tonight this stuff FAILED big time. I did not sweat as much because i was in the room with AC. but i moved around a lot. I smelled so bad I couldn't stay untill the end of my shift (left an hour early and told them im not feeling well) but the real reason was that i couldn't stand myself anymore. I was worried that it will be a turn off for customers and co-workers. I came home and toss it right to trash. Now going to keep searching for the one that actually works."
1,Deoderant doesn't do the job,This product does not handle the underarm body odor well at all. I would not recommend it to anyone.
5,Precious Moments Together is the NIcest Place to be,Item arrived in perfect condition. Very happy with my purchase. Product is the exact same as the picture listed. Great customer service and shipping on time! Thanks!
2,Color faded,"I'm a consistent shopper at amazon and this time around I wanted to give my wife a present she would never forget...I'm very unpleased with what I received, it looks like the item they sent me was taken from a window display where the sun did its work in degrading the figurine colors...I was very surprised when my wife opened it (she loved it of course not knowing how it really should be!) and I noticed the colors were so dim...I was expecting a brand new figurine and I really mean it!Unfortunately this time it's been a disappointing shopping experience at amazon.comI'm evaluating very seriously returning the item...Precious Moments Together is The Nicest Place To Be"
1,poor customer service and product representation,"I ordered this in late Feb & when arrived, much smaller than pictured. Returned 3-1-10 and as of 4-18-10, no correspondence from company or any refund."
4,I bump Say My Name and the Timbaland Remix! 4.05 stars.,"The other songs are just there.Say My Name: 4.5/5Say My Name (Timbaland Remix): 5.25/5Others: 3.5/520.25/5 = 4.05Cover Art: B+ (B and Kelly look best)Songwriting: C+Vocals: B+ (Harmonize the hell out this song, Ladies.)Length: C+Overall: B4.05 stars."
5,"Totally Cool, Totally Destiny","This is such a awsome cd and I don't know what I ever did without it. If I could, I would buy it over and over again. If you buy it, I know you'll love it too."
5,Excellent Song,"I think Destinies Child's new song ""Say My Name"" is a great song. If you thought their song ""Bills"" was a good song this song was even better. It tells you that if you can't respect a girl enough to treat her as well when your friends are around as you would when the two of you are alone then get out."
4,Good except for the Kobe Bryant remix,"Kobe Bryant ruined an otherwise dope song with his boring bars, especially when he ended with: ""Say your name?/I'll say what I want to."" It's stuff like that that explains why his album was shelved."
3,Say My Name,"THe song Say My Name is so catchy, the first time I heard it all my attention was turned onto the radio. I was waiting to see who sung it. When I found out, I went and bought the album. The girls have fabulous voices and all the songs are well written with an 'emotional charge' to them."
3,Alternate version of Mr. Businessman,"This is a very good compilation, except for Mr. Businessman; it is not the original 1968 Monument single version."
2,The Best of Ray Stevens,I thought I purchased the CD The Best of Ray Stevens and had it shipped to my son for Christmas. But instead he received a 45RPM single and on one side was Everything is Beautiful and on the other was another pretty song but not the funny ones that my son liked as a child. I am quite disappointed.Marilyn Wilson
3,Looks great but vendor isn't great,"The lamps look great but one of them arrived with 2 chips - at the top and in the base. My attempts, which there are several, to describe the chips to their customer service rep was a joke. She didn't even know the parts of a lamp!!"
4,"Essential, but Never Going to be a Movie","To really understand a war, its logistics must be considered. While only occasionally exciting, this thorough book presents an excellent accounting of how supplies were moved to the European theater. I strongly recommend this book to the serious student/ WWII buff. It is one of the best books on logistics I've found. Those looking for an adrenaline rush should look elsewhere."
3,"This was a good book, just not a GREAT book","I enjoyed this book, but came away with the feeling that it could have been better if it had been 50 pages shorter. Over the last 50% of the book I kept looking at the clock, wondering whether I should stay up and finish or just give it up and go to bed.The writing was good, although a few times I had trouble knowing who was speaking, as there was a lot of *thinking* going on. And, although I know it's sort of de rigueur in a romance for the h and the H to ""misunderstand"" each other to draw out the plot, I thought there was just a little too much of that here.I very much enjoyed the fact that, although some of the characters were quirky, they weren't overly so.So, overall, this was a good, serviceable book that just didn't really grab ME. But it might grab you."
4,Fun read,"This was a surprisingly fun book. The author does a good job of conveying the ""small town"" atmosphere through dialogue and the ever important ""show don't tell"". That made it interesting and conveyed very effectively the world in which the characters were living. The romance was nice though the Hero was a bit enigmatic: I never did find out why he moved back to this small town in the first place. But the heroine's desperation to get out of that economically depressed area made total sense so the story worked well. The dialogue was fun and there were lots of great folksy expressions and similes that were amusing and many of which I'd never heard before. In all I recommend this book -- it was good enough that I will look for others by this author."
3,bread,"This was a quick read, but at times was more about sex than I would like. What is with men that that is all they think about when they don't even know the women?If you like young people trying to find themselves it is OK."
3,Funny,"I honestly laughed out loud many times during the time I read this book.The characters are so much fun, specially the grandma, she is a hoot!The story is well developed and the characters well rounded.Thanks for sharing the story with the rest of the world!"
3,Love is all around,"Love is all around is fun read about a country girl trying to escape the restraints of a small town. I found the characters endearing even if they're full of self doubt. The hound dog wannabe Pugnacious and the well mannered mop dog Ralph were adorable. Anyone familiar with life in Smalltown, USA will be able to identify with the gossip and scandal that keep the grapevine growing. This is a sweet story and I enjoyed it. The only distraction in the story is the overuse of similes. They became a distraction that did not do justice to the book."
2,Like2Read,"The story is ""ok"" .... not a ""heavy"" read at all. Quick read, ""fun""...nothing that I would necessarily go back to. There are some books I will read many times, this is not one of those."
4,dig those groovy uniforms,"the best thing about season three is the psychedelic colored uniforms. there is not enough dr. smith, the robot and will. guy williams is featured in almost all the episodes and in my opinion, he's kind of a stiff and yes he looks like he's stiff in the pants, those uniforms are tight. although season three features better looking monsters and some better scrips, it doesn't have half the camp value of the first two seasons. i am still looking forward to season three vol. two to see dr. smith doing the frug in a wig and beads. don't get me wrong, this is still my favorite tv show of all time. it was nice to see don and dr. smith kiss and make up on prehistoric planet."
5,LIS 3 voL 1...LIKE THE ROBOT SAID...IT ALL COMPUTES,After reading all the reviews about the picture being blurry and not clear...i thought the worst...well ..as soon as i got mine ...i sat down and watched a few minutes of at least 7 shows...all the while going....whats up with all these bad reviews...to me on my 32in TV...it came across as clear.. bright.. colorful (almost cartoonlike)....so what is all the fuss about !!! ....i do agree with the person who talked about interpostive tranfers.....but i think if fox knew in the 80'S that the future would have us watcing DVD on 42IN HDTV...they may have had second thoughts about less than prefect tranfers .... and i bet with all the complains over this ... we will see in the future a dvd set billed as ...newly restored from original prints...but for now its pretty good ....enjoy!
3,Where's Penny?,"I was very excited when I learned that Season 3 had extras on the dvd which included the cast members thoughts on some of the shows. My excitement turned to disappointment when I watched that feature only to find Angela Cartwright completely missing! What the..?? Penny was as integral a character on the show as was Will, Smith and the Robot, and yet...no clip of Angela?Maybe the second dvd set of Season 3 will make up for this blunder..."
5,This Set Rocks!,"I can't understand what the fuss was about in earlier reviews! While not flawless, the set was presented very well and to my eyes the colors were vivid the images crisp and the sound was phenomenal! This is a series thats almost 40 years old for pete's sake-you're bound to come across a little problem here and there.Geez! If you're thinking of buying this set, what are you waiting for?"
3,No Effort,"It does appear that no effort was made in the video transfer of season 3. The episodes seem bland overall. Even making a ""snapshot"" of a frame, the image comes out blurry. Is it that hard to enhance the old footage and transfer the improved video to DVD? I don't mind spending the money, if the product is worth buying!Fox did get the packaging right. The cover art, the menus, and the special features are very well done. Please just try to do better in transfering the video for season 3, part 2."
3,Production Problems,"Bad news... When I inserted Disc 1 of the DVD set, I found that the disc actually had burned onto it the episodes that should have been on Disc 3. Better news... Disc 3 had the episodes that should have been on Disc 1. The good news... The qualify of the DVD video on my 27"" Sony monitor is quite good. Perhaps the quality issues cited in early reviews have been corrected."
2,Sad,I finally got down to watching this set and I am so Sad. The picture quality is terrible for a DVD release! There are double edges on everything in the background and scan lines running throughout most episodes! How could they justify putting this out in this condition. I wonder if I will ever see Lost in Space in Pristine condition. Very Sad. Shame on you Fox!
4,classic TV,"This show started out as a serious science-fictiion show, but eventually became more a comedy- fantasy than actual science-fiction. There were a number of episodes in season three, however that were well written and thoroughly entertaining; Reminiscent of the early days of LIS. I picked it up because it is good, family-oriented entertainment."
2,HAVE THE VISUAL ERRORS BEEN CORRECTED?,"I gac e it 2 stars for the visual quality...which is NOT good. the images are flat, there is a ""ghosting"" problem (as others stated) and there simply isn't enough contrast. My QUESTION: I boguht this set a year ago---does anyone know if they reissued better quality prints of Season 3 LIS? I would buy an updated copy if they improved the quality. Also--a few people noted that ""edge enhancement"" was overused. That is TRUE--but thta is not the main reason the prints are bland, flat, and not crisp. the real reason was stated by another reviewer who had the knowledge that FOX did not strike PRINTS in the 80's, rather they made some sort of ""internegative"" that needed visual enhancements to look good--in any case--it meant the visuals are flat and look out of focus. As others stated. Season 3, volume one hasd some of the BEST episodes of the whole series--it's not fair to have them released so poorly!!!"
1,WARNING WARNING! QUALITY LOW!!!,"What can you say about a DVD set in which the FBI, Copyright warning, and menu screens are the best looking things? All the episodes appear blurry, as if someone tried to digitally enhance, and failed. The coming attractions are the best looking part. I've seen VHS copies that look better. This show deserves better. Fox should recall and reissue correctly.A real disappointment!CAVEAT EMPTOR!!!"
1,Quality of Season 3 - JUNK!!!!!,"I'll make this short - the picture quality on this season 3 set is horrible, this is my favorite season of Lost in Space and was really looking forward to its release - until now."
2,like most of the episodes but the picture is blurry on most,fox video had no quality control with season three volume one. seasons one and two had decent quality. the video is blurry on most of the episodes on season three volume one. it figures since most of my favorite episodes are on season three.
3,Horrific DVD quality.,"The only reason I'm keeping this is because I have all of the others. This show desperately needs to be remastered on Blu-ray.But I definitely don't need two copies. I only ordered one copy not two. The same goes for Lost in Space season 2, volumes one and two. I'm returning all of them to you unopened."
3,Cute top,I dont prefer this type of construcion. You can obviously see the line where head attaches. Her hair has a big piece of tape around the back. Her outfit is cute.
1,surprised about notification can cause birth defects required by state of cali,"very pretty, delievered promptly and i like it. but quite surprised it had a note in it stating for california residents it is required to state that something in the product can cause birth defects etc and to wash hands after use etc. i want to state this in a review because i did not see this in the product description and people need to be aware and make a choice if they want the product or not.i am rating this item a 1 not based on that. i like the item , it is pretty, the service was fine"
4,Not bad,"Overall it's nice, it's not as green as the photo makes it out to be, but it's not bad. Tiny but a nice addition to anything."
5,Almost forgotten sixties pop-country star,"Sonny's mellow style of pop-country music did not impress everybody but he was hugely successful in his heyday, sometimes with covers of pop songs, although he also had some great original material.Young love is the song he is best known for despite having to compete head-on with Tab Hunter's version of the same song. Of the other original songs, You're the only world I know and True love's a blessing (both co-written by Sonny James) are particularly noteworthy.Sonny took several pop classics to (or close to) the top of the country charts including (on this collection) Running bear (Johnny Preston), I'll never find another you, World of our own (both Seekers), Born to be with you (Chordettes), Empty arms (Teresa Brewer), Only the lonely (Roy Orbison), Endlessly and It's just a matter of time (both Brook Benton).This compilation provides a good introduction to Sonny's music."
5,Another Quality Knife from Wusthof,"This tomato knife is awesome, it slices through tomatoes with the greatest of ease. I was initially concerned about it being serrated (i equate serrated with cheap), but this knife has not lost any sharpness and still slices tomatoes as nicely as the day it was first used. I have not regretting spending a little more money to get these quality knives, I will be a lifelong Wusthof customer."
3,Nikon Coolpix S6,"I bought this camera as an inexpensive way to shoot some time lapse video. It has a couple of limitations in this regard. First it has no exposure and focus lock. So before every shot it focuses and automatically sets the exposure. This can sometimes cause the image to bounce a bit (if the focus shifts a bit) and the image to flicker a bit (exposure fluctuations). The other thing is that it need to run off of a power adaptor for time lapse as it can be on for hours. Unfortunately the power adaptor plug blocks the treads for a tripod. To say the least I had a lot of obstacles creating a time lapse movie with this.Photos look pretty nice for 6 mp. It has a 3"" screen but the resolution is no better than a 2 or 2.5"" screen."
5,Wonderful,Wonderful. That's the only word I can find to describe this book. Senna's true fans do have to read this book. Read it. It's the best book written about Senna.
3,Review of the movie Adi Shankaracharya,"This movie is in Sanskrit with english subtitles.It is a fairly complete life of Shankaracharya. One nice aspect is that it sticks to facts rather than embelishing his life with miracles and other mystical occurances that are often found in books on Shankaracharya. Some attempt is made to present Vedanta philosophy, but it falls short of the goal. It is a low budget movie with actors whose talents do not do justice to one of the pillars of Hindu faith. You get a glimpse of Shankaracharya would have been like."
3,Not my cup of tea,"Whilst conveying some important philosophical tenets from the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, the general standard of the film / soundtrack were, at times, frightful.Runs longer than the 120 minutes featured on the DVD case (put aside at least 2 hours 45 minutes!)"
3,AdiShankaracharya movie,"I expected that this would be more informative especially for children and was disappointed.But, Some of the instances have been protraited very well while others are not as good."
3,so hard to really say,"this item is hard to review.i thought it would be a great vehicle to learn about Adi Shankaracharya,but it wasn't.poor story telling,choppy sequence of events,no linear story line, and too long of a movie.there are some moving parts and interesting teachings to learn-and those are the 2 reasons i kept with the movie.but over all-not as good a job as i hoped it would do."
3,You get what you pay for.....,"The item arrived today. I was a little surprised because the item was not branded. In my past experience Amerock brands their products. So question #1 is ""Is this item really by Amerock?""I received 2 pair and I thought I was ordering 2 each. Better that than the other way.The catch itself is pretty minimal. It is made out of thin sheet metal. I should not be surprised given the price.It did the job I wanted it to, so I am happy. It arrived sooner than expected and that is a good thing."
1,The Worst 50!,"I am a great lover of biscotti, especially since I have to watch my sugar intake. Because biscotti can be expensive, I decided to make this simple cookie and have quite successfully. However, this book is not the book to buy if one wants biscotti of good texture and taste. I remade one recipe (Almond Biscotti) and tried two others (Coconut Biscotti and Milk Chocolate & Honey) to see if I made a mistake or preferred another flavor, but none of them were worth the effort. They were dry and too hard. The recipes I found on-line and in magazines were much better. I'll try another book."
3,Biscotti Recipes,Well I was a little disappointed with the book. I guess I expected a book with at least pictures of what the cookies would look like. I guess that's because I'm a visual person so this may not matter to other people. Otherwise it's ok.Happy Baking!
5,The Best 50 Biscottie Recipes,"This book arrived exactly on the date that it was expected to. I was surprised to see how tiny the book was. But, despite it's size, this book has wonderful recipes inside. So far I have made about 1/3 of the biscotti recipes, making sure I try a new recipe each time, and in the order that the book was written. I have not been dissapointed yet, and neither is my husband. We have always loved Biscotti, and have purchased a variety over the years, but nothing tastes as good as the ones I've made from scratch in this book, especially since they are eaten fresh. I would recommend this book."
1,poor value,Thiswasn't worth the price. I was upset because the price II was charged was more than double than the price printed on the back cover...
2,"The ""personality,"" not the musician","As an example of celebrity biography, this book is passible; it, at least, held my interest enough to allow me to finish it. Unfortunately, I had picked the volume up with the hopes of gaining some insight into Steve Earle as a musician and songwriter, not a mass of gossip about a person who happens to be a musician and songwriter.St. John amply demonstrates the shortcomings of a journalist's approach to biographies: the facts are--these, as noted in other reviews here, not being well checked--presented sans interpretation or insight and there is nothing to be gained from this book that could not be gained by reading sundry articles by other journalists.The author, again as noted in other reviews here, clearly is a fan and just as clearly does not seem to know much either about music per se or the specific traditions Steve Earle fits into and is in the process of transforming.Don't throw the book away if someone gives it to you, but don't bother buying it, either."
4,Hardcore Is Right,"Steve Earle does everything ""hardcore,"" or at least he did. Nothing about his life has been mundane. Earle becomes bored very easily. Earle's quote, ""I have a low tolerance for mediocrity in life and music. I'm into pain and joy, and the inbetween doesn't interest me."" This book reads like fiction. It doesn't delve deeply into the psyche of Earle; I'm not sure that's possible. But, it does chronicle the many rises and falls in Earle's life. Earle's hedonism, egotism and wanderlust permeate this book. Earle is a walking contradiction; gives his heart to you one day, and breaks it the next. I recommend this book for those who enjoy the extremes of life."
4,Very nice HD TV in a smaller size,"I needed to replace the tv in the master bedroom. Since the tv needed to sit on an antique dresser, a 26"" was a bit too big and I started looking for smaller models. I am extremely pleased with this television! The picture is great, the automatic light adjustment is quite useful since sometimes I watch with the lights on and sometimes with them off, and the black cabinet is much nicer than the rpevious silver ones (I waited several months to be able to purchase this in the black instead of the previous model in the silver).Two drawbacks are the lack of a second HDMI connection, and because of the way my digital cable and other units had to be connected, some of the television features (e.g. savingfavorite digital and analog channels) are not functional (perhaps, however, there is an alternate way of connecting that would eliminate this problem)."
1,Don't waste your time on this,"I found this book to be disjointed and not helpful at all. There are much better books out there on money management. My favorite so far is ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" by Andrew Tobias."
4,Veering Right,"Mr. Tiefer admits that he is a lawyer, hence no one should be surprised when I say that he writes like one. In the fine tradition of legal briefs the world over, the style is dry, dry, dry. No Al Franken, this man. However, the information is important, well researched, and dead on the mark. Mr. Tiefer manages to lift the curtain on the current administration so well, that the last chapter of this book will chill you when you realize that it was written a year ago."
1,BIG disappointment,"I just wanted to do a review of this cd to hopefully warn other potential buyers who may have been hoping for more of the same from what Shark Island previously delivered with Law of the Order. I'm not going to go into a lot of detail but there is only one song which I beleive holds up against that exceptional cd which is the song Go West. I got Law of the Order due to reading so many good reviews written about it and I wasn't disappointed. Most of the songs were good and I really liked Richard Blacks vocals. The songs here don't have the same catchy hooks, the production has no guts whatsoever, and Blacks vocals sound like he's either shot his voice out over the years in between or like he's not trying. Perhaps the songs aren't as good because they didn't have the help that they had with most of them on Law of the Order. I don't know, but this was a huge disappointment and I certainly gave it plenty of plays to see if it would grow on me. It didn't."
4,Not the Cliff's Notes,"A highly enjoyable read. Text plus context.Contains the first edition version of Shelley's Frankenstein. Many illustrations, historical notes, and (for illustration only) Frankenstein film treatments. By itself, could adequately substitute any college-level study of the novel."
4,The Annotated Frankenstein,"This is a pretty good copy. There was no dust cover, but the book is in really good condition. I've not seen this book since the '70's. Great find!"
5,Outstanding!!!,"Although I have read the Tanakh, this book really opened my eyes to things I have never seen before! I was delighted to read this overview of all important events in the Tanakh, in fact it has inspired me to go back and re-read what I have already read to find new things!"
5,A Masterpiece...,"Ok.. So I am a little biased, being that I am Jewish, but I do believe that most would agree. This book presents the ""important"" aspects of the ""Hebrew Bible"" with Telushkin's use of excellent language. I have tried other Biblical interpretations from various Rabbis and have often found myself creeping into a steady decline to sleepy-land. But this book is an exception! I have read the author's other works and decided to give this one a try (despite the 700 page factor being a mild intimidation). This book ultimately has lead me to appreciate my Jewishness. Thanks Rabbi Telushkin!"
5,This book is Very good.,"It came with a ripped cover ... otherwise it was good . Interestingly the writer discusses Christian interpretations a few times , with some obvious understanding ... ( as well as a Jewish bias ) . Much of it is basic Biblical History , but many parts were EXTREMELY enlightening , and relevant today ."
1,"Power of the Dog, reprint","Although the cover was nice, the interior printing quality, especially of the illustrations, was very poor. I returned the copies I bought I was so dissatisfied."
4,Full of Facts,"Stuart Nicholson's history of jazz-rock is densly written and provides plenty of information about jazz-rock fusion and the musicians who played it. The book is not written as a chronology, but takes each important musician and gives a detailed history and discograpy of their works.Beginning with early fusion of the mid-1960s through the 1970s and into the 1980s, a whole slew of musicians are covered. In deference to the many less-famous musicians presented here, too much print was given to Miles Davis and Jimi Hendrix, where complete biographies are already available.One of the strengths of this book is the way in which the author shows how the various artists are linked together, depicting their flow of ideas and influences on one another.My only complaint is with the front of the book cover, where John McLaughlin or Larry Coryell should have been pictured instead of Carlos Santana."
3,For a true maniac who would know everything in here anyway,"If your interested in the ""extremely broad"" and compressed history of jazz-rock, this book will interest you. There was lots of stuff in this book that I had absolutely no interest in reading (Kenny G, Sting?) while the few artists I had most anticipated were given meager half page biography's (Herbie Hancock!). I guess that's the problem with a book that attempts to include so much, avoid bias, and leave the reader with nothing but facts. Unfortuanately, intense research can't solve everything, and a huge jazz-rock fan like me can't find anything else on the subject to read..."
3,"""It depends on what you already know""","I think the presentation is worth seeing. It does provide some interesting tidbits even if you have been on the ""path a while""."
4,"pretty good stuff, but deli boy needs training","Four stars only, however -- not b/c of slice-and-wrap issues, rather b/c I have had better -- this is not the VERY best available (though at that price it should be!).Nevertheless it is indeed a very good product, better even when&if; the deli staff learn to slice it as thin as possible and, not lay slice atop slice making separation nearly impossible; instead using plenty of the heavy wax paper between layers of meat. Like: a dozen of sheets per pound if done right (I'm guesstimating -- they still wont let me near big dangerous machines, darn it! ;)This is Italian Prosciutto, not some American boiled ham. No one should be handling it unless properly trained, fGs!Come on now people. Get with the program."
5,OUTSTANDING COLLECTION,"Artie Shaw's 1939-1940 sides are interesting to hear;you can sense just how quickly styles changed in those days ( the addition of strings in '40 gave the band more dimension.) Helen Forrest sings her classic interpretations of ""I Didn't Know What Time it Was"" and ""All the Things You Are"" while there are novel instrumentals such as ""A Deserted Farm"" and ""Shadows"". ""Adios, Marquita Linda"" was the lovely flipside of the million+selling ""Frenesi"" and the morbidly novel ""Gloomy Sunday"" is creepily depressing! Check out ""My Fantasy"" - it's the same melody as ""Stranger in Paradise""!"
4,An awesome book,This book is very interesting. It reads like a story. You just find yourself reading along and then you realize you've learned several facts of history. The book is written very well. There is plenty of interesting trivia and little known facts. It is well worth buying the book.
5,U.S. History for Dummies,Good Book. I is very detailed with the necessary fact about US history that I require.Thanks
2,Too Biased,"Potential readers should know that this book presents US History from a far-left viewpoint. For example, the author suggests that the British held the moral high ground during the Revolutionary War and that the colonists were lucky to win, and that the colonists were primarily a group of incompetent zealots who wanted new territory in which to practice their bigotry and intolerance. He even fringes on being revisionist when he subscribes to the very obscure notion that Davy Crockett didn't really die in defense of the Alamo. The author states early on his view that American history as we know it has been too heavily influenced by writers of European ancestry, and that his is an effort to ""set the record straight"".I feel that it's inappropriate to title and market this book as an objective and unbiased book on US History. I do, however, give the book two stars because the subject matter is so fascinating."
2,"Well written, but ruined by the ideology...","Having been asked by a European friend for a book recommendation to learn the nuts and bolts of American history, I gave this book a pre-read with the idea that it might be a fun way for her to learn the basics. Unfortunately, I found this book to be highly subjective and slanted toward the left. It's a shame because the author is effective in presenting this historical overview in a light, fun manner. If only his ideology hadn't interfered..."
1,SO FREAKING BIASED.,"I'm not into politics. At all. I usually don't care one way or another.But whoever wrote makes me angry.George Washington a snob and a coward?England the intelligent good guys while America were idiotic, rebellious children?American colonists killing the French and Indians because they were full of 'divine spirit?'I'm sorry, but in my opinion it takes a strong country full of wise leaders to defeat the strongest military in the world. This book is ridiculous and makes it look as though America should never have gained her independence from England.If you have an ounce of patriotism in you, don't buy this book."
3,Don't Rely on this as a Reliably Accurate Guide To US History,"This book makes Andrew Jackson, James K Polk, Grover Cleveland and such out to be good presidents and Chester A Arthur, Benjamin Harrison and such forgettable. Also makes the Nazi like treatment of the Native Americans as an abberation, and the hideous treatment of Blacks as regrettable at worst, while making abolitionists out to be as racist as slave owners. Also gets his facts wrong--Andrew Jackson was not president when Texas became a state, James K Polk was president. If you're reading for fun, fine--but don't use this as a reference book."
3,very limited coverage,"Extremely small book, some nice pictures but not enough, 2-3 for each group. Good side is that for each pathology there is a short explanation, so it is not just a picture."
5,THIS CD ROCKS!,"I love this CD. It has got to be one of the best CDs in my collection. My best friend listened to it, and has decided that she wants it for Christmas. It's not just for children like you may be thinking. This product is for people aged 1-100, but if you're over 100, you'll still love it, anyhoo. My favorite song is ""Dee Der Down."""
5,Space Ghost Rocks!,I think that space ghost is FUNNY! But my favorite guy in the Cartoon planet band is Brak. He is one of the funiest guy I Know. Some times I think he is the funniest known to man! M.J.R.
5,Coolio!,"All fans of the great TV shows, Cartoon Planet and Space Ghost: Coast to Coast will love this comical CD!"
4,Space Ghost's Musical Bar-B-Que: Your kids will eat it up,"Space Ghost's Musical Bar-B-Que is one of those CD's that you (a grown up) may not like at first because it is too corny. However, when listening to it with your children (Junior High age or below) it will tend to grow on you and you will find yourself laughing and yes even singing along with it after several listenings. Each song or skit is short and the selections feature either Space Ghost, Zorak or Brak or a combination of the three. I highly recommend this CD for those of you or your children that used to watch the Space Ghost show that now is cancelled. You will really enjoy the time with your children as you listen."
5,THIS IS THE BEST CD EVER!!!!!!!!!!,"put your sox on mama cuz this cd is not on the day der down, it's going up! all the songs are excellent! let me tell you something, i am never gonna bring a monkey to school."
5,hey Braky Wacky!,"the first thing that has to be said is that this is NOT an album meant for just kids. any adult can hear the humor in this, especially my personal fave brak!this album and its follow up (surf n turf) are comedy gems! i don't know how many times i've repeatedly played this cd over and over... my wife has even grown to love Brak! I nfact, ""i love you baby"" was played at my wedding for the cake cutting! And its not just the songs, sketches like ""braks school daze"" are hillariously unforgettable! as a fan of the show, i am SO looking foward to a 3rd release since it is so deep in material!a must buy for any comedy fan!"
5,Boy oh boy!! What a fun CD!!!!!,"This CD is definitely a MUST HAVE for any fan of Cartoon Planet or Space Ghost: Coast to Coast! These songs are fun to sing along with, and dance to. This CD will always put you in a great mood, and I love it!!!"
4,Mild Musings?,"From the trivial, mundane, and the very seriously charged issues the author has an opinion for everything and everyone. The essays may be brief, but they stiil contain Mr. Rooney's caustic tone and dry humor. The great diversity of topics made this a fast read. I found his last four years to be the most entertaining. In 2000-Whats The Symbolism? 2001-The Great Country. 2002-Libraries, and 2003-The French to be poignant and painfully truthful."
2,Andy Rooney's Book,The stories in his book are not as entertaining as the he presented on his television program. Very disappointing as I have always enjoyed his work.
2,Outdated,"While this guidebook is still the only printed source for central Texas limestone, it is extremely outdated. Do not get me wrong, for those wishing to merely sample the limestone of central Texas, this well established guide will lead you in the right direction. However, with the innumerable number of sport routes and bouldering areas that have developed over the past five years, this guide is in need of a serious overhaul. As well, it is DEFINATELY not worth more than 15 bucks! Better to look at Blodyflapper.com or Texasclimbers.com for up to date information."
3,TEXAS LIMESTONE 2 ROCKS !,"GREAT BOOK WITH DESCRIPTIVE DETAIL ON CLIMBS. IT'S REALLY A SIN TO PUBLISH ALL THIS BETA. TEXAS CLIMBING WITH AN ATTITUDE. I LIKE IT. AND YES, E-ROCK IS STILL CLOSED TO ALL CLIMBING... THANKS, RPM"
2,this VQG is too shallow,"I am a big fan of Visual Quickstart Guides-I own them for Flash and HTML (3 & 4) as well, and would never give them up! But this guide was disappointing in its lack of depth. Office:mac is a broad suite of software, and I was extremely disappointed that this book fails to include many user tricks. The Visual Quickstart model is well-applied, but only to simple things such as opening files, setting tabs, formatting chart elements, etc. I believe the shallowness is due to its attempt to cover Word, Excel, Powerpoint, and Entourage in a 398-page volume. A VQG for each module would probably have the space adequately to cover the capabilities of the software. Questions I had from using Powerpoint for several months were not answered.I can only recommend this Guide to those who have never touched a Microsoft Office component before. This is not the ready reference power users are seeking."
2,was not pleased,Had to redrill holes wood cracked just was not pleased with it but already put it together i will go ahead and keep it is not worth the price i payed for it.
1,not what i thought it was,the color is nothing like on the computer the holes did not match up had to redrill them and the wood spilt very unhappy with it.
3,Looks good. Not really for Dodge Caravan,"I have an 05 caravan I wanted to put a cd player in.. Got this dash kit, wired the radio, and started to put it in when I noticed the tabs you pull apart to get the radio in the dash kit keep the dash kit from going into the dash. I used some cutters to cut them off and it went in easily. Looked really good. Happy with the look of the product. Not to happy with the design. There are holes that line up with the tabs. if the tabs were skinnier it would probably slide right in. Also there is a large gap between the stereo and the slot in the dash kit. Of course there are bendable tabs on most aftermarket radios that you can use to stabilize the radio but I try not to use those unless I absolutely have to (which in this case I did)."
1,Aftermarket Stereo Didn't Fit,"When I purchased my Pioneer aftermarket stereo with detachable faceplate for my Jeep I purchased this installation kit along with it. When I tried to install my stereo I found that the Pioneer was slightly larger than the openning in this kit. This was a problem, since I had already taken my dash apart and spliced in the new wiring harness. I ended up cutting a larger openning in the face with a Dremmel tool, which sucked, but ended up working in the end.Check to make sure you have the right kit before ordering"
2,"Be aware, aftermarket radio do not fit","It fits well in the dash, the color is OK, but the aftermarket radio doesn't fit. I had to use a Dremel tool in order of cutting about 3 mm each side so the radio fit. I used a BOSS DVD radio 1DIN, but I had to work a lot on the facia."
1,not so good,i tried to install this in my 1999 jeep wrangler from what i read i thought it would fit but to no avail the screw holes are off
1,Waste of money - Doesn't fit aftermarket radio,"Furious with the waste of time and money on this item. Whilst the kit fits into the 2000 WJ Jeep GC opening, the hole for the radio is too small. Looking at my after market radio and several others like JVC, Pioneer, none of them will fit. As others have done, I will have to cut the opening to make it work. It would be really handy if both Amazon and the manufacturer provided the dimensions including the opening size so we know in advance. Simply saying this model suits your car is total rubbish. It's really not worth my time to ship this back to the U.S from Australia. I will stick to Ebay for parts in the future, much easier to get information from the seller. First and last time I will buy something from Amazon, they should stick to selling books, probably a lot harder to stuff things up with books."
5,Fits perfectly,This dash kit fits perfectly in my Dodge Grand Caravan. I wanted to switch my stereo from the factory model to a smaller model with an Aux input & this worked out perfectly.
5,works great buy it,it looks soo bad ass after install just like it was ment to be there great item.one thing tho there are 2 alinement pins on the back of this item i had to take my knife and make the holes bigger on my dash other then that really easy to use
2,"Does not do the job, for 2004 Jeep Liberty Sports.","It wont simply fit in the provided space.Please think twice, before you decide to order this product, read other reviews as well."
2,after market stereo won't fit,product looks great fits just like it should but the opening is small for after market stereo since my kenwood stereo and dash kit came at different times i had already installed dash kit but the kenwood stereo will not fit. now i have to take dash back apartto remove dash kit and install a different one. metra should warn you that not all after market stereos do not fit. think twice before you buy this product
5,works great,"I installed this on my 2004 stratus sxt and it fit great. Very easy to install, and looks great. Shipped on time, and arrived in good condition. Would recommend to a friend."
3,Fit well in my Jeep but CDs don't fit in the slot,"Inexpensive but was over all cheap. Everything fit perfectly in my jeep, had to bend over a number of the little tabs to ensure my aftermarket radio didn't move around.CON: You can't fit a CD more than a few inches in the the CD slot."
2,Not the right fit!,"I bought this item as it was described as working on a 98 Jeep. However, it should have specified a Grand Cherokee vs a normal Cherokee."
3,"Good relaxing music, but still better with its film's images","The ""Ashes of time"" soundtrack is quite good, but I did not find it as appealing as I thought I would - maybe because I've seen Kar-wai's film only once, and thus remembered the soundtrack in small parts. Also, I think it is better to hear the soundtrack while watching the film, since it seems to have more of a rhythmic and aesthetic value when juxtaposed with the film's images. Nevertheless, it is still a good album to listen to if you want to relax and meditate for an hour of two, or simply give an oriental atmosphere to your place."
4,Surprisingly Good,"I went into The Lone Gunmen with limited expectations. After completing the series I must say I am thoroughly impressed. It seems that a series of this type (a spinoff from the popular series The X-Files) has huge potential to bomb and while it was canceled by Fox the episodes themselves were very good and very original.I've seen some compare this series to The X-Files which I don't think is fair in any sense. There are no monster mysteries here, mostly conspiracies that need to be uncovered. The cast is very good (especially with the addition of Eve and Jimmy Bond, both excellent characters) and the writing behind the show is top-notch and very funny for a majority of the episodes.I highly recommend this series to those who enjoyed any Chris Carter creation. Like most of his post X-Files series (excluding Millenium) this was canceled into it's first season but the episodes that are here are very good. Also recommended: Harsh Realm and Millenium."
3,"Great show, yet horrible DVD manufacturing!","First off, let me say, this is a great show. My so-so rating of 3 stars is due to manufacturing defects in the discs (primarily, disc 2 which has the same two episodes on both sides of the disc which it is not supposed to have but rather three comepletely different episodes in addition on the reverse side. Basically, I got gyped for 3 shows). If it hadn't been for these mistakes in creating the discs, I most likely would have given this item 5 stars easily.The good news, most of the discs made and purchased by everyone else are apparently in great shape and actually contain all the episodes promised (unlike my own discs). So it's with good chance that you will have a great time viewing these odd, intelligent, and humorous episodes starring everyones favorite underdog geek squad."
2,I can see why it was cancelled,"I got this after reading the glowing reviews and seeings I owned all 9 seasons of xfiles i thought it would be a nice addition. Boy was I wrong. The tone is all wrong, its just way too goofy. The pilot is ok, but then tehy introduce a young dumb hunk to try and give the show some youth appeal and it just gets rediculous. This show could've been great as a more serious spin off with comedic elements. Instead we are fed up kindergarten slop."
1,The Lone Gunmen DVD's-A Real Disappointment,"Not good. I thought since the Lone Gunmen was an off shoot from the X File series, the plots for the Lone Gunmen movies would be good. I was wrong and very disappointed. The plots were shallow, unrealistic, and at times, were ridiculous. I think the only movie that was passable was the last one in which he Gunmen are infected by an airborne virus carried by a terrorist. Otherwise, I'm really sorry to have bought this set of DVDs. I know why this series only lasted a few weeks on TV."
1,the lone gunmen,"One disk, in a plastic sleeve, CD was in good shape, but the one disk and no box...for $17.00 I was not happy."
3,Great series - poor packaging,"Could only find 2 copies of this set in my local stores, w both copies at same outlet. Bought 1 and returned it - double sided DVD had a repeat of 3 shows from the front side and as a result was missing 3 of the series 13 shows. Returned the set to the store exchanging it for the only other copy there and that had the same defect. What a disappointment"
1,Not all the episodes,"Bought this and found out that the dvd are double sided and disc two had the same episodes on both side. So it's missing some of the episodes. To correct another reviewer, FOX will not send a fixed disc. No not get the 3 dik edition. wait for Fox to issue a real single sided dvd edition."
3,"Great show, Lousy packaging","I received my copy in the mail today and subsequently planned my evening around watching this as this is the first opportunity I've had to take a break from homework for the week and will probably be my last chance until next Thursday. I opened my package and I wasn't even lucky enough to have a disc with one side repeated. The box was missing DVDs one and two! No fault of the show of course, which will always be great, but Fox Home Entertainment should be ashamed of themselves! So, when you buy it, beware and be prepared to have to submit yourself to the return process at least once."
4,DIFF FRM X-FILES,"I THOUGHT THE SHOW WAS KOOL!! IT WAS DIFFERENT & WACKY,IT WAS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED BUT IT WAS FUN & INJOYABLE.I THINK PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS A TOTAL SPINOFF THUS GETTING DISAPOINTED.I WOULD RECOMEND THIS SHOW TO ANYONE WHO LIKES X-FILES OR NOT,ITS A GREAT SHOW I WISH IT WAS GIVIN A CHANCE & WAS STILL ON TV.THNX!"
3,Missing Episodes,"As with another reviewer, one of the discs in our set also was missing three episodes and was nothing more than a repeat of the first side. We returned the set but plan to purchase another one elsewhere (like AMAZON). Hopefully, it won't be defective.Other than that, the shows are great. It was our 16-year-old son's favorite show while it was on and in fact, the DVD set was for him."
5,Terrific show that never got a decent chance on FOX,"What a delight it will be to have the entire LGM series in a box set. From the opening scene of the pilot, this show was a cut above every other new FOX offering that season, and head and shoulders above the sinking hulk that had once been the mighty X-Files. Unfortunately this little gem got caught up in FOX's vendetta to put creator Chris Carter in his place, and thus it frequently was shuffled to different time slots without advertising, postponed till 1:00 AM by long-running baseball games, and so forth. It's hard for a show to get ratings when the viewers can't find it. Now that it's on DVD, it can find the wide audience it deserved!"
5,HYSTERICAL,Fabulous series! This series is hysterical and should have never been cancelled. Really Funny!
5,A great suprise,"As a big X-files fan. I recently ordered the first 5 seasons, and also own 3 of the anthologies(a must for fans)I remember watching several Lone Gunmen ep when first aired, with no impression.As i always liked their appearances on X files ep, I decided to buy the dvd.WOW, well written, quirky stories. I was not surprised at the level of wry humor(similar to x-files, it is often slipped in so you have to pay attention) Yves and Bond add to the storiesTo bad a second season was not in the cards.TWO Thumbs UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"not x-files, but ok","Not up to the standards of the X-Files but the series was OK - remember it's entertainmentPersonally, I don't think that the Lone Gunmen had as good a material to work with as the X-Files. On the other hand there haven't been very many programs that have come up to the standards of the X-Files (writing and acting).If you've got an evening where you just want to sit back and watch something without a lot of thought then the Lone Gunmen will do it for you."
3,They Were Interesting Sidekicks for Fox Mulder,"The Lone Gunmen was a nice spin off of the X-files that fans should have enjoyed for what it was worth. If you were an X-Files fan and own the entire X-Files collection of box sets you should own this one as well. The short series made an excellent transfer to DVD.I especially enjoyed when (during an X-Files episode) Mulder introduced Scully to the Lone Gunman as ""self appointed government watchdogs"" that had spookier ideas than his. They certainly lived up to his introduction in both the X-Files episodes in which they appeared and their short lived TV series of their own.I really enjoyed these guys who represent the young generation of expert computer ""geeks"" haunting and hunting the world wide web. Don't we all know someone who resembles at least one of these guys?"
3,A good one to rent,"Yes, it is totally faithful to the characters as played in X-Files. Gosh do they miss Mulder and Scully. Well shot, but 1 season was as long as it could be dragged out."
4,"Not The X-Files, But Good Nonetheless","Hey, we all know The Lone Gunmen by themselves wasn't a great show. Mixed them in with Mulder and Scully in The X-Files and you've really got something now. I purchased the series just because of their association with one of my beloved sci-fi shows. But was it really necessary for Chris Carter to kill them off?!"
3,Better as supporting act,Somewhat entertaining but drags after awhile. I can understand why the show had such a short run. These guys are GREAT in a supporting role on the X-Files but they struggle to stand on their own.
4,looks great,"i have this set on my granite island, it looks great, the napkin holder is not the pinch type so keep it full for the napkins to stand"
3,Only One???,Am I the only one that found the holes in the shakers to be enormous? When you use them it is like using one with no top at all. You need to warn guests before they use them. Other than that I do like the looks of it since it matches my kitchen.
4,World currents in jazz,"Brad Shepik, who also plays with Matt Darriau's Paradox Trio, here stretches out as a leader on electric and acoustic guitar, well complemented by Peter Epstein on sax, Michael Sarin on drums, Skuli Sverrison on bass, and Seido Salifoski on percussion. Sverrison, formerly with the groundbreaking Mo Boma, plays a Jaco Pastorius-influenced bass that makes the Middle Eastern-flavored compositions sing.The instruments on hand here include the saz--an Arabic guitar--and the dumbek, a hand drum from the same culture. The blending of these with bass, drums, and sax makes for a great ethno-jazz album, one definitely worth listening to. Check out Shepik's other release in the same vein, The Loan. And while you're at it, listen to all the albums by Pachora!"
4,East meets West - 4.5*,"Recorded in New York, this excellent set could easily have come straight out of north Africa or the Middle East.Yet, apart from the saz & one or two percussion instruments, most of the instruments are very ""western"" & in this context it's a tribute to Shepik & saxophonist Peter Epstein in particular that everything has that eastern sound & ""vibe"".Overall this is a highly enjoyable set where pretty much everything (except ""Quiver of Veils"" which is slightly disjointed & ""Might Could"" which is a delightful guitar solo piece) rolls along in mesmeric grooves with individual virtuosity to the fore. The withholding of half a star is only for the aforesaid ""Quiver of Veils"" & because the last track ""The Flower & the Bee"", in not really adding anything ""new"", is overly long at 14 minutes & perhaps could've been placed nearer the start of the album.Nevertheless highly recommended"
5,So far works well,Not much to write about batteries. I've used them on my car keys for the last week and they work well so far.
3,don't know yet,"with batteries, you don't know until you see how they last. shipping was good and the price was good. I will reserve judgement on the life and quality."
3,ok,The package that i received was totally different with the image that they advertised . the brand is still the same but it didn't come in a nice package like the same that they have for sale.
1,wrong item in search results this is not the same as 2032!,"Somehow battery type 2016 came up in an Amazon search for type 2032. Type 2016 is about 1/2 as thick as 2032. Not sure why I didn't see the difference when ordering but I know I was more focused on the price than checking Amazons query returns. Some battery numbers ARE interchangeable such as the smaller type 44 and its virtual twin type 357. This is not the case with these though. Ironically, I also ordered a netbook battery and the same search return SNAFU happened as well. I received an incompatible battery. Although, there I am out $20 instead of $2. I am returning the netbook battery because it makes sense but a $2 battery costs about the same in shipping cost as the item itself. Amazon needs to return query results that match the parameters, or maybe I should just pay less attention to the price???"
2,Search es run a muck,"I began to search for a watch battery, there were many hits under SR size. I bought of course. What I received was not even a SW size it just came up under search under SW. So I will never use it and it was a waste."
1,Expensive shipping,There is no reason the shipping on a battery weighing a couple of ounces should be $7
4,Batterises,This product is exactly what I was looking for only cheaper that I could buy at a local store. This is a Good product
4,Good Deal,"I'm happy with the purchase. It's a battery, what else can you say. Hopefully it will last, time will tell."
3,Energize!,"I bought these batteries because I was unsure if the device for my car was working or not and it was the device itself, For the price of the batteries, it pays off because thee way expensive in stores. I would buy these again when needed."
5,Perfect match!,Bought to be used with a Casio G-Shock watch. It fit perfectly and the watch started to work right away!
2,"Watch out, Bulk Ship","I ordered these batteries, qty 2 packages, as shown in a 2 battery blister pack with an expiration date of 2016. I received 4 bulk batteries with no known expiration date. Amazon shows no return policy for the vendor and provides a contact number which I called several times with no answer. I would stick with one of the other vendors, looks like I'm stuck with the substitition and unknown expiration date. No big thing it's only 6 bucks but you should get what you order."
1,Do not buy from @mazon (PREUSED BATTERIES),"I should have given more thought to the previous reviews.As described in the previous reviews the picture does not match... the are sending bulk packaging out.The packaging isn't a big deal but I should have taken it as a warning. (can't trust these stingy buttholes)Once I opened the batteries up, I tested them. I do not normally test my batteries but since this ""blister package"" was ALREADY OPEN... I thought I would.Well well.... after putting these batteries through my multimeter I found out that NA@TIONAL DE@LS 1NC are sending out USED BATTERIES.At least It only cost me 2 dollars to see what these guys are made of.Enjoy."
1,Not the same quality described and shown in the picture,The batteries arrived completely in different packaging and very low quality. Not the same shown in the picture. Not made in Japan (shown in the picture). No expiration date on the package.I'm not happy with the quality.
1,Didn't last,"The 2016 Energizer batteries that were ordered in February 2012 died in my watch the end of July. The battery that came with the watch lasted almost 5 years. Batteries arrived on a small undated card, so do not know how old they were. Will buy local from now on."
2,Dead batteries,Either the sensor in my car remote is going out these batteries that i bought are bad. They dont even have enough power in them to unlock my car
3,ok,"These were fully charged and work as described. picture led to believe they were new, but ones received were old stock, they do work fine."
1,These batteries don't last as long as they are supposed to,I use these batteries on the remotes for my car. The original ones and the ones that I buy from the local stores last a loooooong time with normal usage. I bought these about 2 years ago and I already need to replace them. I had to replace the previous set (originals with the new car) after 8 years. I wonder if these are genuine or knock-offs. I recommend buying them from your local store instead even if they cost much more.
5,Works in my car remote,This two-pack arrived very quickly and works perfectly to replace the batteries in my car's keyfob. The range is higher and they were a perfect match.
5,Super quick shipping and good quality,"These batteries were shipped very quickly and the batteries were not old, outdated or otherwise. They are good batteries with plenty of power. I should have changed watch batteries, years ago. Didn't realize it then but my LCD numerical display is super bright black now after replacement."
5,just what i need,fast and to my front door for lass than i would pay from the big box store. why go pay more?
1,Batteries or worthless pieces of metal?,"Ordered a pair of batteries a very good price. Apparently, the price was too good to be true. When we received the batteries, they didn't work at all. There was no expiration date in the box, so i wonder if these were real batteries, or only small metal disks in battery packaging. Since the price was so low I didn't bother to try and deal with an exchange or refund as I needed the batteries now now now. On the plus side the item shipped as promised."
3,YOU WILL NOT RECEIVE WHAT YOU SEE IN THE PICTURE,With that said I did received two energizer 2016 batteries. The ones I received were in individual blister packs not labeled for resale. So far the batteries have worked in my watch. Not sure how long these were on a shelf. Bottom line SELLER PLEASE SELL ME WHAT YOU HAVE PICTURES OR ELSE CHANGE YOUR PICTURE TO ACCURATELY REPRESENT WHAT YOU ARE SELLING.
3,In search wrong,"I did a search for 1620 and this 2016 showed up however it was not clear in the description. So when it was delivered it didn't come close to fitting in my watch. Yes, if I had dug far enough into the info I might have noticed it was the wrong one. Silly me, I believed it when this was the second item in the search for 1620."
2,Not what is shown in pictures.,"First off, I wanted to order 1616 Batteries. I only needed two. 2016 came on on the search for some reason, out of a sea of 1616 battery items. Shame on me for not reading the heading correctly.The batteries that came are from a bulk purchase. They do not come in OEM packaging, as shown in the picture. Shame on seller."
5,"Good price, quick delivery",The batteries were backordered when I ordered them but arrived well before the expected date. Exactly as specified--a good deal in my opinion!
3,"Works fine, but not the same product as advertised","The image, and brand are NOT the same as what was shipped to me. I received a two-battery blister pack torn from a bulk package. It didn't appear to be opened, and the batteries work, but still -- they were not Energizer brand."
5,Just what I expected.,"These batteries were just what I expected, came in a more industrial looking blister pack than the retail version shown but it's the same batteries and they work like I would expect new Energizers too. They replaced the 4 yr old Energizers in my wifes key fob."
5,Button Batteries,"The batteries arrived as specified in individual tearoff plastic wrappers in an envelope rather than in the cardboard Energizer dual pack. Since I needed them for my car keyfob, this is even more convenenient to store in my glove box."
3,Be careful when you do a search,"Bought the wrong size - not worth sending back at this price. Just be careful when you search for a number - other numbers come up, too."
4,different packaging but same batteries,"I received large strips or batteries in the mail not the 2 packs, but I did order 100 of them lol"
5,Energizer quality,"Not a retail pack, but who cares. The batteries I received are good, they are at the specified voltage and were able to source 3mA (pretty good) for two minutes without any appreciable voltage drop or heating. For comparison, these batteries have a rated maximum discharge current of 1mA. I have not tested capacity because I needed them to work for my watch. I have no reason to believe these are not genuine new energizer cells."
3,Not match,The item I got doesn't match the picture listed. That's the reason I paid more to buy this one but didn't get what I expected.
5,It works :),"Its a coin-battery and I got it from ""Ships-n-sold-from-amazon"". I plugged into my car key and it was working. The range was obviously better. I try to get it from Amazon when I can. If its a third-party, it typically has to be the manufacturer itself (like when I got my wireless USB stick). I have nothing against third-party, but I just don't know what I am getting. Would rather pay a higher price-tag and have the peace of mind that comes with it (than a potentially inferior product)."
2,Customer service,Bought the wrong product and hence had to return item. Contacted customer service and it was terrible. Took a whole month to let me know that they have no records of the item. Will not deal with them again.
3,Energizer Bunny?,"Just received the package today, and uploaded the pictures for product description. It's true, the product in the picture is not what the buyer will receive. I rated this product as ""3 stars"" because works fine so far. If it works better than expected I will update the to higher score. We'll see how long these batteries will last."
2,Faulty item,"Not much to say about a battery. Either it works or it doesn't. And mine gave out on me after a week of use. Put it into my car clicker, and it started to slowly die to the point where I pray it hasn't died so I can get into my car. May have just been an old set of batteries. Would have gotten 5 stars otherwise."
5,I Love it,"I love it a lot, it is really good.Hopefully i will edit a more detail review sometimes later."
3,Fair to moderate earphones,"I ordered these to use as on stage monitors-I am a bass player. Also tried them with my personal audio devices, MP3 player, etc. While they sound good-they do not have adequate bass response. I would rate them better than average but in my estimation not worth the average retail price. As a benchmark for comparison, my Bose Quiet Comfort 2 head phones have far superior sound quality and can be found in some sources for the same price or less."
3,Too forward sounding,"Unfortunately, most reviewers do not mention type of music and equipment used. Westone UM2 sound too forward compared to full size Sennheiser HD600 with same equipment (Sonic Frontiers DAC, Musical Fidelity amp) and lossless music. Now, I am primarily listening to hard rock. Perhaps UM2 are good for jazz or vocal, but with, say, Led Zeppelin there is way too much treble. I tried all kinds of fittings, but no luck so far. Shure 530 is similar. So far I am yet to find any IEM that sounds close to full cans."
5,"Better than Shure, and American made!","I've blown through countless Shure earphones(2,3 and 4 series) due to the wire construction.I am a heavy heavy user and somehow ,the body oils destroy the cables. Shure's replacement policy is amazing but I was tired of replacing them every 3-4 months. The Westone's have a better cable for my usage, mine are a year old now and just fine. The sound quality is comparable to the 4 series single driver Shure as far as imaging is concerned but with better bass response. I read somewhere they are made in the same factory as the 5 series (old style). They have a suspiciously similar look so that is entirely possible. My only gripe is the cord is shorter than the Shure products which may not be a problem with your application. Anyhow, if you're in the market for really good quality headphones and cheap like me give these a try. Comparable to the $500 Shure"
5,Yes - they ARE that good...,"They are expensive - and they ARE worth it. I had high expectations based on the cost, and they beat my expectations.I suggest that you listen to your original CDs with them, because you may find that you need/want to re-rip the MP3/WMA files at a higher rate (less compression, less loss) because you CAN hear features you never heard before.Also, if the bass doesn't amaze you, you don't have them fitted correctly. When you get the right fit, the outside world almost disappears and you'll know it's right by the dramatic improvement in bass.The sound is very well balanced across the spectrum with excellent clarity. You need to spend an obscene amount of money to get better than this."
2,"Great drivers, bad fit","I have the UM1s, which are the same shape. I like the sound when they stay in my ears, which isn't that often. They might work for some people, but I'm planning to buy a more cylindrical design."
4,Great Bike Hitch!,"Great hitch, easy to mount and sturdy! We were able to load 4 adult bikes and a childs bike with no problem. When we encountered rough roads the bikes stayed secured with the straps included."
4,AS GOOD AS I HOPED,"After purchasing my Thule 5 bike rack thru Amazon, at a price better than any retail store I checked out, I can say that I am totally satisfied with the product. Though I have not carried 5 bikes yet, the bikes that I have carried fit very well on the rack, well secured and stable. I also purchased the Thule locking hitch pin. It seems that this could be designed a bit stouter, but I suppose that if someone is determined to steal the rack, it would not make any difference how strong the locking pin was. There is absolutely no rattle to the rack when secured with this pin. The unit is easy to install, remove or lower when in place. Overall, I am very satisfied"
4,Sturdy and Simple.,"I purchased this to use to carry our 4 bikes (2 adult, 2 kids) on our Subaru Outback (2010). It was a breeze to assemble and fits well in our hitch. Adult bikes are pretty easy to load-up..the kid bikes are more of a challenge (smaller is actually harder on this bike). Once you get them loaded-up, the various plastic cradles and straps do a nice job of holding everything in place. My only complaint is that the rack has some noticeable upward play, at least in my trailer hitch. If you go over bump, the rack dances around a bit more than I would like. If not for that, I would have given it five stars."
5,"Blissful, ethereal music","I came across this music about 2001 and use it all the time in energy balancing and Reiki. I found Volume Two suited me better than Volume One, although the music is nearly identical. I find Angels of Healing particularly helpful because the high notes tend to draw me ""upwards"". In this music there are no nature sounds [birds twittering, waves crashing], no gongs, no percussion, and no catchy melodies. It's simply soothing, ethereal music that glides along. It's unobtrusive. If you just sit and listen to this music it may not do much for you. It could be almost boring. BUT, if you are engaged in energy work, you may find it helps you slip effortlessly into the flow so that you know intuitively where to place your hands. At least, that's been my experience."
5,Still a great book!,"I guess after two years mine is still the only review?ANYONE else read this book? Have ANY thoughts about it?I still think that it's one of the best, most honest books written for young adults about the topic of sex."
4,Excellent jazz album !...,"an excellent album, that mixes contemporary performers such as - Norah Jones, Bryan Ferry, George Michael, etc... and some all-time favorites such as Louis Armstrong, Henri Salvador, Tony Bennett, Peggy Lee, et al... What a great compilation !.... Thank you EMI records for putting out such an heavenly cd.George Michael's ""The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face"" is one of my new favourites..."
5,My third-grader picked this one out herself!,"My daughter was attracted to the cover and title of this book. She immediately read it to herself, then asked to read it aloud to me. She loved the story (as well as the adorable pictures) of how a girl was born to play baseball...even though she was the only female on the team. I would highly recommend this book to any girl or boy who would enjoy reading about one smart and determined young lady."
4,Great if it is not a suprise,"I ordered these for my husband for his birthday and he loves them, easy to install and are holding up well. Make sure you are home to get the package if it is a gift or send it somewhere else as it did NOT come in a brown box. My husband met the guy from UPS at the door ""surprise"" :("
3,"OK book, but buyer beware","This book covers a good deal of material in a very hot area. However, coverage is uneven with occasional mistakes. The book seems to be collected in a hurry some lecture notes. For example, the formula for the relationship between jitter and phase noise given at the beginning of the book is wrong (even units do not make sense) and is not the same for the expression given in the PLL chapter (it makes more sense).I believe a good book on the field is yet to be written."
5,Excellent RF circuit design book.,This book will help analog circuit designers who always wanted to learn what is going on the RF front. Most of the books on RF circuits are outdated and uses only discrete solutions. Author has done a wonderful job of providing a systematic approach to RF design. The key thing I like about this book is what to watch for in RF designs compared to conventional analog designs
3,Wait for 2nd edition,"I found this book during my study maybe in library since 2000. This book is very good to introduced me to the filed of radio frequency circuit. I also bought the other 2 books, ""Design of Analog CMOS integrated circuits"" & "" Design of Integrated for Optical communications"" of Prof. Behzad from bookstore. But I think some parts are the same. I hope that the recent book "" Fundamental of Microelectronics"" have some differences from the others book because it has more than 900 pages. I am now prepared to do some research for RF power amplifier but from chapter9 of this book, it has not enough detail for me to do some research. Because recent book of Prof. Behzad is still expensive for me I will wait until the prices drop to less than 100USD"
3,Unlikeable main character and too many pointless mentions,"I guess I was the only one who was not fond of this book (I read it in English, so maybe it's a bad translation).I found the main character, her mother, to be a worthless human being who never did find her role in life. Her life was depressing to the max... no matter what she did, seems like she made things worse instead of better.There were a lot of little mentions that never got followed up, which I found annoying (in particular, several hints at lesbianism, but then the characters involved either disappeared or were married off).The history and perspective were interesting (justifications for slavery and creating eunuchs!), but I found it to be a bit of a slog through her trying to justify her existence."
3,its ok,the soundtrack is ok although why would the play a song on the preview and not put it on the track? (goo goo dolls / black baloon) same thing happened at the movie Down to you! they played the same damn song and wasnt on the soundtrack? wassup with that? that is a tight song and should be played
5,Great Soundtrack,"This is a very diverse soundtrack. It has a little something for everyone. But the best songs are those by Sixpence None The Richer, ""I Need Love"" and ""We Have Forgotten"". ""I Need Love"" by itself, is worth the price! ""We Have Forgotten"" is also a masterpiece."
4,"JESSICA,NICK AND SIXPENCE",JESSICA SIMPSON NICK LACHEY AND SIXPENCE NONE THE RICHTER REALLY MADE THIS SOUNDTRACK ALL WORTH IT!
2,Ashley's mom,"I was very excited to finally have a new jogger. I first took it on a dirt path and it did GREAT. Then as we were going home, on a paved road, it kept pulling to the left. I couldn't get it to go straight. Also the hand brake did not work at all which I should have know that would happen since the one in the store didn't work either.This does have great storage, but that doesn't make up for the problems."
4,Great value for your money,My hubby and I bought this product because we didnt have an actual bed frame but wanted the look of a bed. I am satisfied with the product and would recommend it to anyone looking for the same idea as us!
4,Worth the Money,"Attractive, easy to assemble Headboard that feels more sturdy and looks considerably better than its $80 price. Does not come with bolts to attach to Bed frame."
4,Great price and great product,I purchased the headboard and one of the night stands for my wife for Christmas. It looks really good in our bedroom and the price couldn't be beat. We are a younger couple just starting out and it added a lot to our bedroom. I would recommend this product to any young adult or couple just starting out.
3,Good For Guest Room,"While the furniture looks elegant and classy, it is flimsy and can break. It was relatively easy to put together, though there were bolts that were missing. This would be recommended for a guest room, where the furniture won't be used often. Or even a kid's room, where the kids can be tough on the furniture and even if it breaks, it's not expensive, so won't matter too much."
4,Perfect for the price!,"I didn't want to spend a lot of money redecorating my bedroom so I decided to order this headboard and other south shore furniture. All the other furniture were very hard to build so when we finally got to the headboard...it was a piece of cake! My dad did all the handy work but I did help some. When puting these items together you really do need 2 people. After we put the headboard up I was very pleased. For the price of $80 bucks it is well worth it! you wont be disappointed just remember you have to buy additional screws to mount the headboard to the bed, not really a big deal just a few dollars, its just the inconvience of having to go out and get them. Oh & yes, it is a bit wobbaly but not too bad, the legs don't touch the floor so it does wobble a little but you will be just fine if you put it againt a wall.My room looks very nice, not cheap looking. I recommend this headboard."
4,South Shore Step One Collection Full / Queen 54/60-Inch Headboard...,"This product was very nice and so far very durable, I would recommend it to all my friends and family."
4,Met My Expectations,"This was VERY easy to assemble and it looks great.I only needed a screwdriver (and I did not need a 2nd person as the instructions recommend). I must admit that the shipping box did make me a bit concerned because it was badly beaten up, but all contents were fine (there was one minor blemish, but I could live with it).I was looking for something that was simple and tasteful - without looking cheap. This piece perfectly fits the bill. I'd be inclined to purchase more furniture from South Shore (with the understanding that it wont last forever).I'm as pleased as I expected to be!"
4,Full size Headboard,The headboard was satisfactory for what I needed it for. I love the quick shipping Amazon has and you can always find what your looking for cheap on Amazon.
2,Okay headboard.,"I bought the South shore bed and desk, and I LOVED the furniture. I was very satisfied. I ended up buying the headboard, but this product I was somewhat disappointed with. It looks good now that it's put together but the instructions aren't specific and if you don't do it right (for example, make sure the holes are on the inside of the 2 boards rather than the outside so the screws will fit with the other parts...) You will end up with TOO many holes! It doesn't show you where the screws should go or what side, and It is easy to make a mistake or 2. If it was more clear I would have been more satisfied. Now I have too many holes in my headboard that are visible. I also dont like that you can see the screws. At least they are dark though."
3,Its Okay,I needed a headboard for the guest room and this does its job. You get what you pay for. Not the best quality but it looks pretty good. It doesnt attach to the bed well and will bang against the wall even if you just sit on the bed.
2,Lack of Quality,"Upon receipt of this headboard it was discovered that all of the parts do not match up for assembly. The lower cross board was 1/4 inch too long and would not fit between the two vertical columns. The hardware provided for mounting the headboard to the bed frame was intended to mount the headboard to a wooden bed frame. Not to mention, if I would have used the hardware to mount the headboard to a wooden frame, it would not have worked. The holes for mounting the headboard to the frame are 3/8 inch throughholes and the hardware provided was 2 inch drywall screws. Very disappointed but I guess you get what you pay for."
1,Looks nice in picture...only in pictures,"This headboard looked awesome on the website, but upon arrival you'll realize what cheap and flimsy materials it is made of. I chanced putting it together, because I figured it would have been more of a nuisance to send it back. I never got it completely assembled because one of two longer screws included with the set basically stripped itself out of the leg, splitting the leg in two in the process (I would liken the legs construction to a slightly more rigid cardboard). I guess you really do get what you pay for."
3,Attractive but annoying,"I purchased this headboard to go with my South Shore platform bed (which I love). Once assembled the headboard looks great, however it does not attach firmly to the bed frame so any movement causes the headboard to hit the wall behind it. I really loved how it made the bed look complete and modern but I have been really disappointed in the construction."
2,"Skip this one, BUT.....","My family received this as a gift and found it very disappointing. First, the good: There are a couple of wonderful selections here, including Gene Autry's Rudolph and the absolutely beautiful Arbolito. I'm Gettin' Nuttin' for Christmas is also good. (That's why I gave it the two stars.)However, many of the selections seems very un-Christmas-like, PARTICULARLY The Takeover Before Christmas, which appears in the middle of the cd. This is a totally inappropriate and out-of-place selection that ruins the flow of the entire cd, in my opinion. Also, Spike Jones' All I Want for Christmas is My Two Front Teeth is WAY annoying - sounds like Mr. Hanky of South Park fame is singing it."
2,Is this a kid's record?,"I bought this for my 5-year-old daughter, who hated it. I don't really see how the content will appeal to a child--it is tongue-in-cheek, not the simple celebration of Christmas that the title promises. Why they included ""The Takeover before Christmas""--unemployment, divorce, corporate takeover--is beyond me. There are *much* better offerings in MFLP's line (for instance, Children's Favorites) than this one, at least for small kids."
1,Definately not a good cd,"I was very dissapointed with this CD. We thought it would be lot's of fun, something different. We put it on while trimming the Christmas tree - by the time we got to the singing dogs we had had enough. However, if you are looking for something non-traditional - this may be for you."
5,Singing along deserves a candy cane,The Singing Dogs version of Jingle Bells was kind of cute although it did sound cutesy. Someone helped my whole dorm at my old school act it out.
5,Mattel 2005 Holiday Barbie Doll - African American,Our granddaughter Mattel 2005 Holiday Barbie Doll - African American is beautiful and adds even nore beauty to her growing collection.
1,Disappointed: Product Delivered Does Not Match Picture and Description,"I was interested in this model because it advertises a flat wide base that's covered in powder-coat paint, which I thought would do far better in outside conditions. However, the model delivered has four metal legs with casters, which is very model I had sought to avoid. I can tell this different model is not going to do as well outside."
5,"Long, but not boring","This is a long book, make no mistake. I got it for Christmas, and just finished it. The bulk of the book is a series of case studies. Faludi went to talk to people, mostly men, about what they thought meant to be a man.The men she talked to were in some way icons of masculinity -- construction workers, Promise Keepers, astronauts, action stars, and porn stars. I found her account of these people fascinating, and heartbreaking. I laughed, cried and snarled my way through it.The first chapter was a little bit difficult to get through, but after that, I annoyed my children because I wouldn't put it down and pay attention to them.Some of my own personal pain in the last five years was thrown into an entirely new light by this book. No doubt some will disagree, but it didn't really seem political to me at all. To me it was about people."
3,A bit disappointing,"While I found Susan Faludi's new book 'Stiffed' fascinating and have recommended and loaned it to male friends I thought that as a journalist she should have been briefer. She was often needlessly repetitive and I think the focus groups she used was restrictive. She focused on the very young male, the adult/teenage talking to members of the `pussy posse' which was not a fair barometer of the young male I don't thing. She spoke with middle-aged men disenfranchised men who had been laid off and a couple of reformed gang bangers. I just do not believe that her focus group were a fair example of American men. But she did make many insightful observations and the book is interesting, just not as good of a representation of society that its size would indicate. It's a good book but pick it up from the library, borrow from a friend or wait until it comes out in trade. I suppose I just expected more from Faludi because I would have given anyone else a five."
1,Faludi is blowing smoke.,"The most accurate indicator of the plight of American men is the fact that a woman like Faludi can write pretentuous garbage about men and gain nationwide publicity. On the other hand, male authors such as Jack Kammer and Warren Farrell have a hard time getting published, and an even harder time getting publicized."
3,Good book.,"OK - so now we know man-boys cannot grow up and the reasons therefor. However, let's not make excuses and dwell on the past - let's learn how we as individuals and as a society can ""teach"" man-boys (and everyone) to accept responsibility for improving their own happiness, their own behavior, their own lives ..."
1,Stiffed by hate,"This is another foaming-at-the-mouth denunciation of men. Behind the plea for tolerance is a not so thinly veiled hatred of men, especially Evangelical men."
1,This Book Was Horrible!,"This book was terrible. Faludi puts up a sympathetic front, but only to cover her man hating feminist roots. She ends up blaming everything that she portrays as man's problems on men. The same thing feminists have been doing for women's problems for years. This book is a propoganda campaign at best. A reaction to the growing men's rights movement. Things have gotten so bad for boys in this country that no one is buying the feminist's girls are the shortchanged gender in schools studies. Stiffed is a desperate attempt by women like Faludi to keep the blame spotlight off themselves. Faludi makes generalizations about Vietnam Vets that she should really be ashamed of. Is it any wonder that the men portrayed in this book have been writing to their local papers complaining about how Faludi protrayed them in their book? Faludi has not left her man hating days behind her."
1,Poorly researched,"The topic of this book could have made for a great work if the author had done comprehensive and objective research. Faludi interviewed a very narrow section of the male population to apparently confirm many of her own preconceived notions about men and what makes them unhappy.For those interested in the topic, the book Real Boys is infinitely more insightful and meaningful to those who want to understand men and boys."
1,"""Research"" goes ""Tabloid""... Truth gets Stiffed","How sad. Authors now have a few conversations with a few human subjects, jump to conclusions that appear to mesh with ther prior preconceptions, and then peddle the whole mishmash as some sort of social science ""research."" For each of the troubled men Faludi describes in this book, I can easily think of a dozen or more who have faced similar circumstances in very different ways, and have very different views on the matter. I guess these men just don't count, since Faludi has not graced them with her supposed journalistic saavy. I am a social scientist by profession, and this is definitely not social science. However, if you think you might like the equivalent of a 600 page plus ""Cosmopolitan"" article on men, then you may enjoy it."
2,READ MARK SIMPSON'S 'MALE IMPERSONATORS' INSTEAD,"'Stiffed' suffers from a lack of analysis and argument which it tries to make up for in length - never mind the quality, feel the width (of my advance). Moreover, what's offered as this book's `big idea', that our media saturated culture has `feminized' men in the way that women used to be, rendering masculnity a `performance', has been said before - and much more sharply - by Mark Simpson in his book `Male Impersonators: Men Performing Masculinity', published way back in 1994."
1,Want to know what's wrong with men? Don't ask Susan.,A stereotypically feminist view of the American Man.Susan should have really listened to the men she talked to rather than simply push them for quotes that 'confirm' her preconceived notions of American masculinity.If you want to buy this book check your local used book shop. I'm sure there will be plenty in stock. I know for a fact there will be one half read copy in the UW book shop.
1,Foolish,"There's something about the topic of men in society that attracts gummy-minded writers. As bad as the vaporous Robert Bly and his many imitators are, however, they are paragons of clear-mindedness compared to Susan Faludi. Faludi has stitched together a couple of dozen dreary overlong magazine profiles of an assortment of oddball losers and is now trying to pass the results off as an assessment of men today. This is lazy, but even worse are her Marxoid yearnings for the days when men earned their living in overalls, their faces smeared with coal dust, swinging a sledgehammer. Collecting hardluck stories from gay porn stars isn't reporting. Emptying a reporter's notebook onto a page isn't writing. Fantasizing about the return of John Henry isn't social criticism. At bottom, Susan Faludi's problem is that she mistakes sloganeering for thinking and that she's too wrapped up in her obsolete ideology to notice the difference between the two."
1,I Couldn't Finish It,"She started with a theory and went in search of cases which fit that theory...that somehow men in America are damaged goods. With a little attempt at serious journalism, she might have done something good with this book. I managed to get about 1/2 way through before giving up on the book. I passed it on to my girlfriend, who after a couple hours said of the book, ""Kind of stereotypical portrait of men"". `Enuff said. If you want to read about men, try Bly."
1,Shows an odd attitude toward her subject.,"What if a male journalist were to write a 600-page book that focused on interviewing Leona Helmsley, Lorraine Bobbitt and others like them, then concluded that their complaints were the chief issues that most women face? Would women reviewers find such a book to be ""a must read for all American adults""? I think not. Yet that is the essence of what Susan Faludi has done in this book."
1,"Elegant writing, bad research.","If you're going to generalize about a group of people, you need to have a sample of that group of people. Instead of a sample, Faludi selected a small number of very atypical men then used them to espouse her own views. Her previous book was truly great because it focussed on something Faludi understands: how women are misrepresented. This new book itself misrepresents. Sad."
1,Don't bother.,"This is just a fading writer's attempt to keep the money flowing in. Read David Burns' excellent ""Intimate Connections"" for a much more valuable discussion of how to get past the inter-gender hurdles that bother us all."
1,Iron Jane?,"Another reviewer suggested reading Warren Farrell instead. I suggest reading Robert Bly's ""Iron John"" instead -- to get a line on what men think without going through a middle(wo)man. Bly said everything Faludi said, said it better, and said it ten years ago. Where has she been? Oh, right: attending men's meetings and ridiculing them."
1,'Stiffed' refers to the purchaser of this book,"Faludi probably deserves credit for doggedness in gathering reams of anectdotal stories. The principal conclusions are essentially that life is unfair (now there's a surprise) and that all our fathers were imperfect men if not brutally insensitive SOBs.The book is physically a heavyweight and intellectually lightweight. As the phrase goes, this book should not be set aside lightly--it should be hurled with great force."
1,Exhaustive reporting on selected atypical men.,"(sigh) I gave this a five-star review when I first heard about it, before I had read it. I was expressing my hope that the issues of quiet, responsible, hard-working, well-educated family men were finally being heard. (Yes, Virginia, we really do exist.)I was mistaken. Instead, this book focuses on the stories of men whose stories are anything but typical, and whose complaints can easily be shoved aside by the reader. It reads like a circus freak show.After an incredible 600+ pages of reading, I must still conclude that we aren't being heard.Rats. Another hope dashed."
3,It's Just Ok,"Some interesting insights. She focuses too much on Douglas and the shipyards. I didn't enjoy the patronizing glorification of the black workers, we all had it tough baby.A subject that needed print, very much overlooked.JHL"
4,Men stiffed again by Susan Faludi's feminism,"The copyright of review of STIFFED by Susan Faludi that I sent you today called ""Men stiffed again by Susan Faludi's feminism"" is owned by me. I am only letting you use it for a one time event. Since you are paying me no money you have no claim against it. If you accept it you accept my terms. Charles H. Seitz"
1,Excercise in Hubris,"This book is nothing more than hubris disguised as empathy towards men. Faludi, in keeping with the vast literature trove of feminist misandry, doesn't really care about the male condition or problems men have. Any sympathy she may profess to have is just a come-on to proffer her work as a legitamate inquiry into the nature of men. In reality, it's just another profane feminist excercise in the gratuitous bashing of men."
2,for V shape,"Not fit for normal man, just for a man whit a extrem V shape !cheap leather strapping.but cool for décoration and only for décoration."
2,really uncomfortable,"if there was a way to reform this to ""fit"" my hubby's shoulders, it could be worn, but as it is, it is more for show - not to wear on a normal buff 40- year old"
4,This is a great item!,"I dug a 400ft deep pit in my backyard. Occasionally I will strap on this breast plate and invite neighbors over so I can kick them into the pit while screaming ""This is Sparta!""My neighbors don't bother me anymore. ...Very peaceful."
4,Policy Review,I needed some additional information to help in understanding the policy process for an assignment I needed to complete and the book gave detailed explanations which I fould quite helpful.
3,Ok Book,Since this is a required for my MPA program so I have to read it. It is pretty boring. The best way to get thru this is read it in bed.
5,Study material for a class,"A part of study material. It was read to pass an exam, and the test was successful, so I guess the book is good!"
2,An Introduction To The Policy Process,The book was very redundant filled with wordiness that could have been written and half the pages which said the same thing.
1,Unheroic Hero,"'When Lena received startling news of an opportunity to visit Windara, the farm in Queensland which her great-uncle owned, she did not hesitate to fly out there.But on her arrival she found that the situation at Windara had changed-and that her future was now bound up irrevocably with that of the attractive Rod Carron!'"
5,Wonderful Music,"I first purchased this disc in the late 90's. I instantly fell in love with Marty's music and recall playing this day and night. Most of the songs are based upon Psalms and assorted Scripture. The opening track on this disc..""Risen Again"" is so powerful..so moving. So, too, is the 2nd cut -- ""Pleasures Forevermore"" -- based on Psalm 16. Wonderfully, this music is not overproduced..for the most part, Marty at the keyboard. Just wonderful. This disc has sustained me during difficult times, and has brought me countless hours of enjoyment."
2,Very disappointed,"I'm a big MM fan and even had the pleasure of sitting front row a couple of years ago when they toured with MWS. It was a fantastic show. I'd been waiting for a live dvd and when I saw this one available, I wasted no time ordering it. Big, big disappointment. Lifeless. It seemed like the band was simply doing a 'sound check' and wanting to get through their songlist. They were very methodical. There was no passion in the singing, no emotion, no spirituality. The studio versions are overflowing with emotion and passion. But not this live dvd.And every few songs the concert is edited out and a bit of other footage is edited in for a couple of minutes. Then back to the concert. Totally took the momentum of the concert out. I hope the next one is better. It wouldn't take much to be better than this one. Will I still purchase MM cd's? You bet. Will I still pay to see them perform live? Without a doubt. I'm just disappointed that they couldn't deliver something with a little bit of soul."
5,Will The Real Women Please Stand Up,"I've been reading some of the reviews written about this book and I must admit I was quite surprised to see that some women just don't get it. I am a man who enjoys and respects all women and I found this book to be very informative and eye-opening. I read the book in two days and I also read where Ms. Patterson stated she interviewed over 7000 women for this book. So why are so many women taking it personal. It's a must read for all women. Why because it down to earth, truthful and very candid. Women need to stop trying to hide their feelings and listen to Ms. Patterson. Just be yourself and accept those things that you like and don't do what you don't like. Keep an open mind ladies and try not to judge a book by it's cover. Open your mind and learn what the book is really saying. Stop being so self-centered and taking everything you read as an opinion of you. I recommend this book to all women that I know. My mom, my three sisters and my daughter."
2,Weird,I really don't understand how to wear these earrings. They are flimsy so I guess you're just supposed to pry them apart and shove them on your ears but I'm not sure how long the earrings or my ears will last at that rate! I'd pass on these...
4,Expantion Pack,"This game Surprised me with the upgrades. I thought that when you buy the expantion pack that it upgraded the single player version of the game. It didn't. The only thing I think that changed, was when you cheat to get the Tricorder, it looks different. Now the Tour mode of Voyager was great. Great Detail. You can set off the Red Alert (Janeway Gets Mad) Self-Destruct the ship (Chakota shoots you). The hole thing with the Tour is that you hack into the computer and get all the access code. After that you can do anything. Shut down the warp core, get into officers quarters, use the replicator system. And all kinds of stuff. Overall, I think that it was an OK upgrade. Just for the Tour mode. They did add some maps in the internet games and added some models."
3,Good... but very few changes.,"This expansion is good... But there have been few changes from Elite Force. There are new models, and new skins... There is also a new option... and some new maps... but no ""Major"" changes. The expansion add a great option to walk around and explore Voyager. From the bridge to sick bay and the Cargo bay to the holodeck... You are able to enter new worlds on the holodeck including an episode of the Holo-Novel ""Capitan Proton""... You can even launch the Auto-Destruct on the bridge.... As for the maps these are good.. esp. for multi-player games and death-matches. There are also new skins and models but as with the maps if you play online for a while the maps and the skins will download from the server... so you could get them for free... To tell the truth the addition of the Voyager option is a good reason to buy it, but because of the lack of other additions i can only give this 3 stars..."
5,"New maps, tour mode.....","Get it. Thats all I have to say. Get it and the original. With new maps, new skins for holomatch, and tons of other features, this is going to be a great expansion. And did I mention that with with expansion you get a patch which over-writes the dull Joan B. Seven-of-Nine's voice with Jeri Ryans?"
5,Counting the minutes,"I have the original version of Elite Force, and let's just say that it IS the absolute best Star Trek game ever made. Hours and hours of fun, especially in Holomatch. I'm addicted; even went so far as to order high speed internet to enjoy it even more. Will Star Trek's influence ever end? I hope not!"
1,Bizarre and Outdated--What A Letdown,"This video was disappointing. It is very dated and bizarre. My two-year old is actually showing an interest in the potty on his own and loves potty books, etc. However, he could have cared less about this video."
5,"Maybe not potty training, but it will entertain for years!","Silly ole Mom bought this for her 2 year old 16 years ago.Needless, to say, daughter is now 18 and mastered the Art of Potty some time ago!BUT! She and her friends pulled this video out for YEARS and laughed and laughed! They found it hilarious up until they were 12 or so.I am quite a bit older than that, but it cracked me up too!!!!""She is a Super Duper Pooper!"" is a song that has resonated in my head for years--in a good way.Don't waste your bucks on things like this if you think it will enhance potty training (most of us get the idea after a while). But if you have a weird sense of humor like us, do purchase! It will give you many tummy laughs.I DID think that the little guy always hanging around the kids when they were on the toilet was a bit creepy. lol!"
1,Focused more on Party than Potty,"The theme of the video is Bobby's birthday. I felt like the potty topic was secondary to the party! A lot of time was wasted. I think this video would be most appropriate for kids who have almost mastered potty training, because it showed kids taking breaks from having fun in order to use the bathroom. I almost bought this video. I am so glad I just rented it from the library and didn't waste my money!!!"
3,Good for an older kid,"This video is a good choice for an older kid, not for first-time potty users. There are several ""breaks"" from the potty instruction material to follow other story lines. This holds a 3 year old (or older) child's attention better than just slamming them over the head repeatedly with potty info. But for a younger child it would probably not be an effective way to discuss the potty. My 3 year old son loves this video, especially the scene that shows that boys need to pull their pants down before standing up to pee. But this video is not a ""magic pill"" that will suddenly teach your kid to use the potty. I give it three stars because my child loves it, but it doesn't have him running to the potty afterwards."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I bought this for my son, hoping it would help him in his potty training. It is so boring! I couldn't even get him to sit half-way through it the first time I turned it on. It's slow going and really not very interesting... not for a toddler, and especially painful to watch as an adult. I'm sorry I wasted my money on it, and I hope you don't either!"
4,Outdated Clothing but Good Message,My daughter started singing the songs after the first viewing. The DVD is empowering for both boys and girls. There is a short doll story in the DVD that should have been eliminated but it still kept my daughter's attention.
2,"Old video, more about a birthday party",I got this DVD thinking it would be good but my husband and I were very disspointed. The video tells more about a birthday party than the actual potty training process. It even has a song about a clown that has NOTHING to do with potty training!It is an old production and therefore not appealing to a younger generation.
2,Not what it's cracked up to be!,I was disappointed in this DVD - the best thing in it shows kids lining up to use the bathroom. Much better stuff out there for potty training - like Elmo's DVD!
1,"Too much ""poop"" talk.....","This video made our family very uncomfortable w/the language. If you want ""poop"" or ""pee"", this would be a terrific video"
4,Kids loved it. I thought it was WEIRD.,"I have no idea why this corny video is so appealing to my little ones, but given that they also love/loved Barney, the Teletubbies, Yo Gabba Gabba, etc. I guess I'm not that surprised. As a parent watching it, it is the dumbest, most annoying video ever, but I have used it to help potty train all 3 of my kids over the years, with favorable results. So it was worth it to me! 4 stars (5 for my kids and -1 for me!)"
4,Captivated My Son,"I had a lot of trouble getting my son to Potty train. He just didn't want to. There is a song for just about every task of using the potty, both to instruct and reward. Its theme is a birthday party, what kid doesn't love that? He loved this video and learned all the songs quickly. They are all popular nursery rhyme tunes, short and easy to remember, and although I often felt silly singing in public bathrooms, it really worked. 4 years later and I've repurchased it for my 2 year old. She seems to love it too. Adults complain, and yes its rather insipid entertainment, but really its geared to 2-3 years olds, so parents, get over yourself."
3,It was just OK,"I read extensive reviews prior to purchasing two potty training dvds. After reading all of the comments I purchased ""It's Potty Time"" and ""Potty Power"". For my child (27-month old boy), ""Potty Power"" completely captured his attention. ""It's Potty Time"", however did not at all. Now when we try to go potty he always says ""Potty Power!"". I even find him asking to watch the movie on his own occasionally.I realize all children are different, but for what it's worth, I would vote for ""Potty Power"" over ""Its Potty Time"" without hesitation."
4,Not bad.......,"We own this DVD and ""Bear in the Blue House.... Potty Time"" and hands-down this one is much more effective. Our daughter (22 months)seems to be captivated by a lot of the songs and scenes and has yet to grow tired of it. Within a week of watching it, she started to ask to sit on the potty, and now is comfortable sitting on it for a few minutes at a time to read a book, although we anxiously await the time when she puts two and two together!"
1,Boring!,"I bought this and ""Potty Power"" for my daughter when we were trying to potty train. She absolutly loved Potty Power, but when we put this in, she went as far as to shut the TV off. I could not get her to watch it at all. I wish I had bought a different show."
3,"broken,but replaced","after a little more than a month on the bike I came home to find the antenna mysteriously laying on the floor in the garage with a ""chunk"" cracked out of the base where it screws on. I live alone and nothing else was in the vicinity so I don't know if it was a stress crack or from the vibration of being ""in the wind"" or what all I know is its now JUNK.With help from the seller and the manufacturer i found the broken item has a lifetime and it was replaced free of charge.Guess I'll give it another try."
3,Good workout - just wish there was more of it!,"Love Gilad and the way he presents the workout the problem is the workouts aren't long enough! Each workout is about 20 minutes so the cardio section isn't long enough either. I like the warm-up section but the cool-down isn't as good either.Overall it's good for a daily activity but just needs more! I wish the 20 minuntes could be extended to a full 30 at least. This shortened workout is a result of his TV show and the removal of the commercials. Sadly, not as good in the form of DVD because as a tv show you could work out during the commercials.. now there aren't any to work through.You can fast forward through any talking and go directly to a workout. LOVE that feature so that's a major plus!"
3,too short,The dvd contains three episodes that are only 20 mins long. It is way to short and he speeds up and changes the routine too quickly. This is probably due to the fact that the show was 30 mins long and only 20 mins on the dvd.
5,Perfect!,"Got these as a party favor gift for my 5 yr old's birthday party. They worked great and she loved them! They were bigger than I thought, but that was just a bonus!"
2,Watch T.V. instead,"Not horrible, but, there are many better things to watch. I couldn't get into this movie and couldn't make myself like the main character. Who gives up their entire life (risks their job, forgets to pick their kids up at school) to play chess?"
5,A Charming Story,The story kept my attention throughout. I particularly liked the subtelty of the acting by the two principals. The story kept my attention throughout. I have already sent it as a gift to two relatives.
5,"enjoyable,","A thoughtful, entertaining film about a beautiful , sexy, intelligent woman that looks in the mirror and see's a poor homely cleaning woman. Life is around her but she is existing in an unfulfilled disrepected hell. She finds her purpose and happiness as she appreciates her incredible talent."
5,Very happy!,"This book is fabulous. If you are a scrapper or like to alter books, this is the book for you. Very inspirational; will make you want to start your own. If you like journals, you will enjoy it too. Beautifully done. Bought one for my mother too."
2,"Good idea, horrible execution","I had such high hopes for this book because I thought the concept of a mystery playing out in a visual journal was so unique. However, there is nothing mysterious about this book. I am baffled by the reviewers who say they went back to find ""clues"" that they had missed. I don't understand how you could miss anything--it was all so obvious. As soon as the murderess appears you know exactly what is going to happen.And, I'm not even going to comment on those who are wondering if it is really fiction except to say that anyone can start a myspace page under any name they wish. How gullible are you?If you must read this book, get it at your local library or read it in the bookstore (it doesn't take long at all). Whatever you do, don't shell out any of your hard earned cash for this one. What a disappointment!"
3,"Interesting, but don't hold your breath...","About a month ago, I heard about this book so I was curious to find out more. I even logged onto the book's own website to read about the ""unsolved mysterious death."" The clippings and pictures were intriguing and I eagerly awaited the release of the book to see if I could solve the mystery.However, now that I've read it, I have no idea why I was so excited in the first place. First of all, I thought that this was a real mystery, not a work of fiction, so when I read the little disclaimer in the front of the book, I was so disappointed. The storyline was hazy at best and I felt irritated at the main character for being such a wimp.If you are a collector of unusual books, such as the Griffin and Sabine series, and price doesn't matter, you will probably appreciate the beauty of the artwork. It is gorgeous and there are a lot of fun little details to peruse. But if you want to read a good mystery, I'd suggest something else."
2,STyle over substance,"While this is a stunning graphic accomplishment, it's no ""Twin Peaks"" in terms of plot development. I confess that I *thought* it was a real story---I believe I saw a blurb on amazon that led me to believe this before it was published. Imagine my disappointment when I realized it's really just a glorified scrapbook with a flimsy plot. Ho-hum...this is one of those books that I wouldn't mind browsing through in a book store, but I bought it sight unseen so I only have myself to blame."
2,Interesting concept that just didn't satisfy,"This was an intriguing premise, finding a scrapbook/journal and then discovering what unfolds in this woman's life. The only problem is that the premise doesn't allow for a very satisfying ending. I think you're left with too many questions at the end and it just leaves you feeling unsatisfied. It only took about 30-40 minutes to read, so I suppose the time invested isn't so bad."
3,cool idea,"it's a cool idea, interesting to look at.... but i'm not sure if I had to do it over again that i'd buy it instead of look for it at a library or something to just see it once or twice"
2,"Pretty to look at, waste of time to read","I have to say, I was quite disappointed in this book. It is a beautiful book -- a quick flip through the pages promises a fun mystery with tons of places to hide a variety of clues. Unfortunately, the pages don't actually deliver on these promises and once I finished, I couldn't help wishing I could ask for my time back. On the plus side, it only took a short while to go through and, as I mentioned before, the pages are quite lovely. I feel like the Atkinson sisters had a great idea with this book but were unable to follow through to tie-in the story and the technique.I glanced at the user rating for this book here on Amazon and was quite surprised to see that it has been given 4 out of 5 stars with 38 reviews. I'm going to have to go flip through the reviews now to see if perhaps I've missed something monumental...(alas, no)."
5,HIghly Recommended,"The premise of reading someone's diary was excellent and it got me hooked right away. Of course, I knew it was a book, but somehow I still experienced that note of tension as if I was reading a private diary, and that tension and the mounting feel of unease is what I want in a mystery. I loved the artwork in this book, in fact, that's what made it interesting and added a complexity to what could have been an ordinary tale. Through this art the character's emotions were laid bare on the pages and that gave the book a strong psychological angle, a visual view into a woman's innermost thoughts and insecurities. Were these fears justified? This book has the feel of graphic literature which would make it interesting to my friends who want and expect to go beyond the written word."
5,Excellent documentary about the power of women,"A very moving documenyary about women of Liberia who team up together to fight the atrocities brought to their country by dictatorship and warring clans. By the power of their fearlesness and courage and by holding on to their moral viewpoints, they help bring about peace in their country and install one of the first female presients in Africa. Shows you what the power of conviction can do."
1,Does NOT kill bedbugs,"I live in a guest house that got infested. After hearing the radio commercials I ordered a couple of bottles and sprayed on the furniture. Of course that didn't work so I thought, maybe I need to do a full on fumigation. So I dropped the money for the cedarcide fogger $300 and enough bottles for 2 treatments. Well I did exactly what I was supposed to and fogged so good, my lungs and eyes were burning. Per instructions I did it again 2 days later. And guess what? Immediately afterwards I was getting bit again....I mean like next night. So the product is BS. They got my money. Don't let them get yours. Better off calling the pros. 0 stars."
5,Works on contact! 24hr residual/lasting effect.,"I have a German Short-hair pointer with fleas and ticks. I tried a few name brand ""spot drops"" and she became sick. Found [...] and decided to give it a try. Safe, all natural. Kills on contact! Fleas instantly, ticks take a few minutes. There is little to no residual effect after 24 hours, so I have to spray her every night. I also spray her bedding. I used the ""Best Yet"" formula and I just ordered a gallon more. Smell is strong but very tolerable. I have not tried spraying the yard but I don't think it would get rid of pests outside for very long. It might not work as well for pets with long hair. You might have to really work it down to the skin, where the fleas are.I highly recommend this product! THE safest alternative to chemicals."
5,"Beautiful, exciting, ......for everyone.....really","I came across this in a book store on Long Island while I was looking for a Course in Miracles. The title and cover art caught my eye and I was so excited by it that I bought 3 copies. I love the imagery of the section titles: the dig, the dive, the design, and the doing. I also like the discussion of the 10 artistic profiles. I think I'm a mystic/thinker/teacher/realizer/interpreter. Since I live in SF I hope to catch a workshop with the author. This book has also prompted me to explore Julia Cameron's books."
5,A Lifesaver.,This is a book for anyone looking for focus. It keeps you grounded while letting your imagination soar. It's what you need. Trust me.
5,The quotes and interviews alone are worth the price:,"Carol tells us ""I discovered . . . . that I instinctively knew how to help [creative people]clarify what they wanted, navigate the vague terrain between vision and real life, and arrive at practical solutions."" She is clearly gifted, and not only as a well-read writer and a counselor for those of us crying (for whatever reason) for creative focus. Buy this book if you have become serious about facing and dissolving your fears and blocks to the long and winding road of your unique creative happiness and life worth living."
4,"Not the most advanced pop-up, but very cute story!","If you're used to books by the master paper engineers like Robert Sabuda, the pop-ups in this book won't wow you. They're pretty simple. But what I appreciate is that it's a refreshing/cute story...not just a book filled with popups. I think most kids would love it."
5,The Wide-Mouthed Frog,The book provides a very good moral and learning experience in that the pop up entertains the children making them want to listen to the whole story.
5,Great book!,I ordered this as a gift for my nephew and couldn't be more pleased. He's going to love it!
4,Great Pop Up Book,"My children have loved this book. I have had it for many years and all the pop-ups are still in place. So I consider this ""very sturdy"". The story is cute and teaches at the same time. The reason for the 4 vs 5 stars is that it is fairly short. I wish it would have incorporated a few more creatures. This book held the attention of all my younger children and they often giggled while I read it to them. (actually, I giggled too!) This was a very creative book and I would recommend it to everyone with younger children. Terri ""Hunter"" Ward, children's author of One Starry Night and Aunt Tami's Strawberry Farm."
5,The Wide-Mouthed Frog,"This pop-up book is a winner! Children ""ooh"" and ""ah"" over each page. The ending is a big hit too!"
4,The most innovative pop-up book in a generation!,I read my children this book at least every night - they almost never let me go without reading it over again as soon as I've gotten to the end. The pop-up illustrations are so clever that it keeps me entertained every time. This book has even replaced their favorite Brothers Karamazov pop-up!
5,3-D Frog Book,"Love this book! I have used it for over 10 years in my classroom.The children love the pages seeming to ""jump out"" at them as each new creature appears."
4,Cute Pop Up .. We gave it as a gift,What can I say? The 2 year old that we gave this to absolutely loved it.
5,2.5 yr old loves it,"She got this book for Christmas and loves it. It's got good pictures and is a funny story. All of the animals that pop out are fun to play with. When the alligator first popped out, it scared her a little, but now she like him."
4,A must read if you like anything Salinger,"This book is an excellent follow-up to Franny and Zooey. I'm not sure this can stand alone - so go read Franny and Zooey first then you'll love this book. After you've read this book, then you must read ""Bananafish . . ."" the first short story in ""Nine stories."" This will give you more insight into what happened to Semour Glass. All Salinger is excellent stuff. Why do I care so much about the Glass family? Ah, the magic of Salinger."
5,"Two beautiful, empathic stories","I love RHTRBC - it catches so many little details about people, it's kind of funny in the way reality is, it's as warm and empathic as Salinger generally is. I love Seymour too, although I'd be less likely to recommend it, I think it takes a certain kind of pensive reader who has absolutely no concern for ""the story."" It's the kind of thing I wish I'd get paid for writing, yet doubt I could pull off so well as easily as I think, an unstructured memoir, sort of stuttering in places about an obsession you can't quite get out, will never be happy with how you express it because it's not all yours to express. I do wonder if the author means for Seymour to be seen as the flawless near-angel his brother sees him as, or is it more a study in the effects he (the admiration and his suicide) had on his brother, but even if he meant the former, I always settle on viewing it as the latter."
3,Not Salinger's best,"This is a good book, but my least favorite by Salinger. The first section, ""Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters"" is a great story, but ""Seymore: An Introduction"" is easily my least favorite thing Salinger ever wrote. It's basically just 120 pages of rambling - there are a few interesting parts, but through most of it, I just felt like screaming at Salinger to stop rambling (and to stop apologizing for rambling) and to just tell the damn story."
3,-,"Carpenters is beautiful. For anyone with a brother that you've had to answer for or walks a different line than your own, you'll feel this one."
4,Half of it's a tough undertaking...,"...which doesn't make the experience any less rewarding. Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters is a complete joy...and like the other Glass stories, a fun part of the family puzzle. Seymour: An Introduction feels less fulfilling. While it provides much information that helps the Glass-family-follower, much of it seems unformed, rambling and rawly philosophical. Nothing wrong with that unless you'll feel more rewarded by an actual story in the second half of this collection."
3,Empty,"I have been pleased with all of J.D. Salinger's work until I read this book. I found some of stories so aimless that I had difficulty believing it is Salinger.The first story, which actually seems to have a point, is told on Seymour's wedding day. Seymour does not show up for his wedding, so we are left to hear of the awkward interactions his brother endures with the in-laws-to-be. Toward the end of this first story, Walt's seemingly unhealthy obsession grows with Seymour's poetry. The second story, ""Seymour: An Introduction"", revolves around Walt's recollections of Seymour. These recollections might be interesting if there was a point in how well Seymour shot marbles, how big his hands were, or how well he wrote poetry. The second story was painful to read as it was so dry.Salinger is a great writer with many great works. That being said, skip reading this book."
1,Total junk,"Totally insane! Don't expect Holden Caulfield, he's nowhere to be found. This book is just whacked out beyond belief. It's really nuts. Salinger has gone crazy and there's no plot no humor no reality. Re-read Catcher in the Rye and don't waste your time with this."
1,Very boring book and I would not recommend it.,I found it to be very boring because of the character Seymour. There was nothing about him I could relate to. I'm not even sure what this book is about - It was just that awful.
4,Half of a great book,"Do NOT miss ""Carpenters"". It is one of the greatest novellas from the 1950's and Salinger is in great form for this one. It is funny, touching, beautiful. ""Seymour"" is a failure, though. Supposedly an introduction to a novel which never saw the light of day, it is long, boring, plotless, rambling, self-conscious and self-absorbed to the point of being a waste of time."
3,the 2010 of J.D. Salinger,"I've never met anyone who feels the way I do about this book (well I've only met two people who have even read it), but I wasn't as entranced by it as I was hoping to be. It was too explicative. Although I certainly didn't hate this book and think it was meritless, it is down there with ""Zooey"" as my least favorite Salinger stories."
4,"If you hang in there, it's worth the effort.","I'm a longtime lover of Salinger's writing, but I've never been able to get through Seymour. I liked Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters, but I would always get bogged down in the first 20-30 pages of Seymour and stop reading it. In the beginning of the story he jumps around a lot, and his paragraphs can go 2 or 3 pages long. I always felt like I was listening to a clever and witty narrator who didn't care at all about connecting with his audience. But after getting through these first pages, I started to really like the writing. There is a great letter from Seymour to Buddy that you're bound to like if you like the emotional, family exchanges in Zooey. There are also some great sections where Buddy speaks directly about what writing means to him. They're fascinating, and you won't find a more moving discussion of writing anywhere."
3,Unequal Reading,"Just like Franny & Zooey this is a novel with two parts. The first part in both (Franny and Raise High...) are short and good narratives and makes you realize the writing skills of Salinger, NOW when it comes to the second part in both books: PURE disapointment (Zooey is maybe less sufferable than Seymour Introduction), both have a continuous Buddy Glass ruminations that make it very hard to get into the story (if there is one). Boring."
3,Seymour a waste,"Raise high the roofbeam, carpenters is a very good short story and it is must reading for Salinger fans. Seymour, however, is a different story. This is a tedious, meandering, pointless exercise about nothing whatsoever. The end of the creative line for Salinger."
4,My Second Review - Salinger again!,"I think this is the first book Salinger wrote about the Glass Family. Seymour is the eldest and wisest member and he is like the most perfect older brother anyone could have. Unfortunately his ghost hovers over all of the Glass family. The Glass family were all precocious children starring in an American TV show. They all looked like the ideal American family, but behind the curtain they were all deeply dissatisfied with the shallow adulation they received. A main theme throughout the story is search for truth, search for something satisfying in such a shallow and patronising culture. Just as relevant now as it was when written."
3,raise high,I half-way expect to see a collection of Seymour's poems sitting on the shelf every time I walk past the poetry section in the bookstore. Am I alone on this?
4,no title,"Please note that I am reviewing only ""Seymour, an Introduction"".I don't think I'd ever read Salinger before, and this piece was a pleasant surprise. Hard to describe, is it a short novella? Fiction, a homage to Buddy Glass's brother, Seymour, who committed suicide eleven years before, written in the voice of Buddy Glass. This was first published in The New Yorker in 1959. As it is all written as an essay, with no dialogue and precious few paragraphs, I doubt it could get published today. Talkative, conversational style, as if the reader were simply sitting beside him. Of course I liked it. Difficult to believe it is fiction. Or is it? Wonderful line about writing on page 187. If you had your heart's choice, what piece of writing in all the world would you most want to read? Then sit down shamelessly and write the thing yourself."
2,"I really wanted to like this, but...","Probably like many others I sought out Salinger's other books after enjoying Catcher In The Rye. Disappointed with Nine Stories, and totally let down by Franny & Zooey, I continued on to this book. I found the first story - Raise High The Roof Beam, Carpenters - an enjoyable read. There was hope yet, and Seymour seemed to be the most (only?) interesting character from the Glass family stories; so Seymour: An Introduction would probably be the best story of them all. It turned out to be a kind of pretentious ranting by the author and all the philosophy books that he had apparently read. I was really hoping to find some of the magic that was in Catcher. The first of the two stories in this book came close to offering that, but the second one was impossibly frustrating."
5,in Salinger's lesser-known work lies his true genius,"Think what you would most like to be reading, right now... then write it! (seymour, an introduction)I can't, because the most beautiful, or not even beautiful, the most powerful english work I have ever read has already been written: ""Seymour, an introduction"". The rambling, so very human narrator, in awe of his brother, brings us straight into true human feelings, grief, and confusion. But many authors can make us identify with the narrator; what is different in this book is its wisdom. Not only does it draw us in: it keeps us, teaches us, moves us, and leaves us with new vision for life and for art.If you can appreciate it, I would recommend this book as highly as I am able to."
5,Perfectly Incomplete,"Salinger is so often measured against what he could have been. What he gave was more than enough. These collected pieces, from a whole that was arguably never finished, constitute some of the finest American writing of the 20th Century. Beautiful and sad, in the best way."
4,"A good, but dated resource.","I would consider this book to be a good parenting resource, it has helpful exercises for parents and educators. The examples and language are a bit dated, but a lot of the information is worthwhile."
1,Learn how to be a manipulator? No Thanks.,"I just finished reading this, and I'm actually a little bit mad at these guys. I didn't even mind so much that the book is a thinly veiled sales tool for their seminars and ""mentoring"" program. It didn't fool me for a minute, so I could take it as that...and still be open to learning something new. But I did mind that the ""win-win"" sales technique they are teaching people is a thinly veiled ""here's how to manipulate people into believing you are consultatively selling."" (For those reading this who are not professional sales people: consultative selling is an approach that should truly end up with a win-win, where you are truly offering a product or service of genuine value to the customer.) It's also kind of crazy, since they seem to believe that this manipulative approach will result in building wealth that can then be used to make the world a better place. I agree with the later, but not the former."
5,Buying Forclosures with no money,Very informative and loaded with sound stratagies. Step by step layout with detailed explanations as well.
1,Dont waste your time - Infomercial for their mentorship program,"I found this book insulting at times. It is a poorly veiled attempt to get people to fork over the thousands of dollars for their mentorship program. A lot of sections are told from the narrative of some ""newbies"" to the program and how the support they received from the conference calls get them going.Almost nothing of substance on anything that the title suggests would be covered.Dont waste your time on this one. You will nothing new that you did not pick up from their first book ""Buying Homes in Nice Areas"", which I would recommend."
2,"Dave and Pete are great, but.....","I have read three of Dave and Pete's other books and thought those were so much better. This book is supposed to be the first in a series of three books about getting to be a ""level 3"" investor, someone that earns $5k to $50k monthly on a passive basis. I did learn a few things from this book, and found it to be motivating, but as a Dave and Pete fan, I was very disappointed. The book is just a huge advertisement for their mentorship program. The book is from the perspective of a few new mentorship students and their experience at the first intensive training session.If you have read any of Dave and Pete's other books, don't bother with this one. If you haven't read any ofDave and Pete's books, I would definately recommend them. Just not this one."
2,ok read,This book seemed to focus a lot on how beneficial it would be to order the course(s)by the author(s). It was ok.
4,Inside vew of real estate investment training,"""Buying Real Estate without Cash or Credit"" is a detailed look at what a beginning investor working through Peter Conti and David Finkel's Mentorship Program actually experiences.The book is filled with information about finding properties, connecting with sellers, the various types of acquisition and exit strategies that allow for profitable investing, plus insights on funding deals without tying up personal cash assets.Although the information provided in this book is extensive, because the story is told from a Mentorship Student's perspective, the content is never dry and the emotional aspect of investing in real estate is also explored.The personal drama made the book an easy read, but the real value is in the detailed investing techniques, negotiating tactics, and online bonus materials. If you invest in real estate, or are considering investing, this book is for you."
5,These are so great!!!,I absolutely love these stick ups... they stick so very well and youc an remove and move if needed... they are a great size and look so adorable
3,OK product,"I purchased these for my daughter room. I loved how the wings on Tinkerbell are glittery. They are very pretty. However, they do not stick very well. Within 2 hours of applying these on the wall, they began to lift. My mother and I went around with wallpaper paste, then Arlene's tacky glue, to put down any lifting areas. Once that was done, they have stayed nicely, but it was more work than I imagined it to be."
1,Tinker bell walll stickers stink!,Stickers do not stick and are a total disappointment. They are a disappointment to the child and the purchaser. DO NOT waste your money.
1,Tinkerbell Wall Stickers,These were horrible! They would not stick to the wall. They kept curling and would not lie flat on the wall. I had to purchase ones from a local store...I won't purchase from this site again.
2,Adorable but she flies,"They are absolutely adorable...my 3 yr old loved them when I put them up over her bed at lunch time...by bath time...Tinkerbell was flying, off the wall, that is...I also chalked it up to a bad batch, until I read the other recent reviews...seems to happen more often that notI also ordered spiderman stickers for my son at the sametime...and spiderman clings perfectly...I will not order these again..."
1,"Interested in purchasing, but...",Can't find info as to size! How tall? Bad presentation on Amazon as information not given. Boo Hoo...I'll shop elseware.
5,"A rich text, filled with the painful history of Mexico","Dreams of the Centaur, a book which I read some 5 years ago and still affects me, tells the story of the ramifications of the miscegenation of the Native Indians and the descendents of the conquistadors. It is a complex tale that incorporates both the heinous massacre of the indian natives and the beauty of the Mexican culture as well. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys well researched and thoughtful commentary on a difficult subject."
2,North Dakota Post Offices,"I had thought this would be a comprehensive review of North Dakota post offices, similar to ""Names on the Face of Montana"" by Roberta Cheney. In her 324-page book, Cheney gave an extensive review of each Montana community that ever had a post office, including brief town histories, how the towns were named, and who was the first postmaster or mistress. Cheney's work also had a 6-page bibliography and cost $12.00. However, ""A Checklist of North Dakota Post Offices 1850-1982"" is just that, a 15-page pamphlet listing no more than the post offices in alphabetical order, the date opened and the date closed, if applicable, and an abbreviation of the county in which the post office was/is located. While of elementary use to a collector of North Dakota postmarks, as a historical reference it's useless and doesn't even have a single line of bibliography. To say that ""A Checklist"" is disappointing would be a gross understatement."
1,Straight to the dump with this thing,"We bought this for our 2 year old son who was bigger than most kids. Right away we had issues with the pedals just spinning when he would try to pedal, so I took it apart in a feeble attempt to fix this toy. After logging at least 5 hours on this thing, I got it going for him again. It only worked for another day and then the pedals started spinning again. This product deserves no stars as it's nothing but junk that looks cool."
2,several issues with the bike..not worth the price at all,"I ordered this bike for a christmas present for my son, and it was broken, so he was unable to ride it on christmas morning! Amazon, was very helpful and made the return as easy as possible. However, it took forever to recieve the new bike. Once I recieved the new bike, there were a few rust spots on it, and stickers were smudged, they had a lot of air pockets and wrinkles in it. I do not reccomend the bike for the price it is selling at. My son loves his bike, dont get me wrong, but for all the defects in both bikes that we have delt with, this bike should not sell for anymore than $40-$50 bucks! If your considering on buying I would second think it, because even if you ""think"" your buying a ""brand new"" one like we did, it still looks used! Good luck!"
2,Kawasaki Trike,"I am very dissappointed in this bike. It does not go in reverse or stop. First, I received the bike in a broken box that was wrap in a bag. Then, there were some missing pieces and screws as I was assembling it. This was supposed to be a suprise for my son's 3rd birthday. So I returned the bike to Amazon for a new one. This time the box came as is and not in a bag. The bike came within 2 days after I called and explained to Amazon that I needed the bike right away for my son's birthday. This was a good service by Amazon. Overall, this bike is unsafe for my son because it does not stop if he goes down in any slope."
2,Son doesn't like it!,"I bought this trike because it was billed as being sturdy and could take a beating, but please know that this trike is very heavy and is difficult for my 2 1/2 yr old son to simply pedal! He struggles to get it going, gets frustrated and quits. His last trike was lightweight and he loved it, so I was bummed that this one just sits in the dining room not getting used. The steering is very stiff and last week the back axle nut fell off somewhere and now the bike is not rideable until I find a replacement. Don't recommend."
2,it's not what i expect (-),"i expect something better for the price (-)i wont recomen this tricycle i bilive you can get somethin better than this item (check on line before you buy, there is better options)"
3,Trike like and dislike,"I write this review with mixed feeling.First of all this is a great looking Trike,and in my view it is well constructed for durability. It has a very comfortable seat and the color is very bright.However there are a few draw back that i would like to highlight.The first is that the instruction mannual that come with it is totally useless, it does not help you if you dont know a thing or two about assemblying bikes.The other issue i have with this trike is that i would not recommend it for a child older than 3yrs. I bought it for my son who just turn 3 and it is very difficut for him to ride it. His knees keep hitting the handle bars thus it takes the joy out of him riding it .Overall the Trike is Okay, but it did not meet my expectation whenit come to the fun factor."
2,Disappointed / Small,We ordered this for our four and a half year old and it is WAY too small for him! The box says 2-5 yr olds and his knees touch the handle bars. It looks pretty sturdy and was a little tricky to put together but once he got on it......it was way too small. Disappointed! I think a 2 or 3 yr will love it...now I guess we have to give it aaway or try to sell it!
1,Inferior product/ DOA/ Do not waste your time,"I buy from Amazon so regularly that UPS drops my neighbor's deliveries on my front door..that's how often he comes by. This product arrived with amateur taping job with over 3 layers of tape in all kinds of directions, suggesting it was a returned package. I suspect the box wasn't even inspected before it was turned around and sold to me. The parts did not fit well, and the front wheel was inoperable in either direction. Thorughly disgusted with this purchase. I might move my purchases to other online vendors from Amazon for selling this under Amazon."
1,Had two and both broke,"The Kid loved this trike, but after just over a week it broke. He was riding along, pedaled backward kicking in the free wheel, and when he went to pedal forward again the pedals just spun without moving the wheel. Amazon was great and got a replacement out to us within 3 days, but again, with just over a week's use the second trike broke in exactly the same way as the first.The Trike looks great and it worked well out in the yard (while it worked), but the shock is completely non-functional for the size of kids that are going use this trike.After two trikes breaking Amazon is done sending replacements, and I totally understand that, but I'm super disappointed in the product"
4,Love this shoe,This shoe is nice to wear to work and it is very comfortable because of the rubber sole.
1,Two Left Shoes,"I ordered these shoes and received them. I received 2 left shoes. One was a size 10 and one was a size 7 1/2. Now, they do not have the item available in my size."
1,A Rip Off,Sandelan's music is nothing but a headache to listen too. This person is what gives new age music a bad name. It is the same melody over and over and over again for each track and it becomes aggravating and annoying to listen to. A trained monkey could play this so called music. One gets tired of listening to his cheap carnival like organ. Do not buy this trash
5,"""ARIA"" The New CD from GROVER WASHINGTON, Jr.","I got home today and there was my copy of ARIA by Grover Washington, Jr., waiting for me at the door. He has always been my favorite smooth-jazz artist, so even if I didn't like this CD, I'd still give it 5 stars. It's not what I expected but what a great recording! If you like ""All My Tomorrows,"" by Grover, you'll love this just as much; it's very mellow and the other musicians and orchestra blend in with him as though they'd been playing together for years. I know I'll be sitting here at my computer and playing this CD over and over. Buy it!"
3,Good for new couples,Great book if you just started to date someone or if it is a new friend however at least half you will know the answer to if you are married.
2,Quite basic,"I found that if you're looking for an insightful book, this isn't the one for you! I'd say a few of the questions can actually spark a good debate, but this is only best for those who don't know each other and enjoy small talk.Random questions I opened to are: ""Do you shy away from cameras or welcome them"", ""What do you and your friends usually do for fun"", ""Does your personality match your physical appearance"", ""Who would you prefer to never speak to again? What made them so undesireable, ""How many people have you said I love you to?""So, this isn't exactly what I was looking for. I found it a mediocre book at best."
5,"Great album, great latin flavour!","Great album. Latin flavour mixed with afro-venezuelan drums and other caribean rythmes. Excellent combination: venezuelan singer: Blanquito Man, Luis Blanco, from China: Glenda Lee and many more... ska, reggae and Venezuelan roots and culture all together in a great album... their best!"
2,Boring Read,"I had a hard time reading this book, it was somewhat slow and boring. Also the fact that the main character still talked to her imaginary friend was corney at best. Yet, the book does have some good moments its just so few and far between."
1,My Mistake?,"Driven by a Denon AVR-788 @ 90 Watts/Channel, these speakers emit such scant volume that they are not worth the little space they fill. I see they are rated at 300 Watts, so maybe they could add something in a system of high current. But for my system? They'll have to go back where they came from."
1,Disappointing,I did not really like this game. I was excited when I got it but when I started to play it I was not that happy.
1,"A real ""Bomb""",This is one of the worst games I've ever played. Within minutes of playing the game I knew that this one was headed for the junk pile. The other 1 star reviews have done a good job of describing the problems. Save your money for Mercury or Lumines if you like puzzle games.
1,I recommend against this book.,"I was disappointed to have paid good money for this book. Many questions are not resolved clearly. There are four mistakes on page 2 alone. I could not possibly recommend this book to anyone, and I'm sorry I bought it. I gave it one star because I couldn't give it less."
1,OMG I think this is so not worth it.,"After reading the reviews , I thought this would be a good alt to WoW. I WAS SO WRONG. This is so complicated, repetitive and boring. Its not very interactive and you have to know someone to get in to a guild. Ok, so what you can start of at Max level but thats because its no fun working your way up. You can pick your party members from NPC's instead of a Looking for Group interactive with real people you may or may not get along with so no rolling for loot but the the loot is awful any way. I will stick to my World of Warcraft. And although this game is free to play online there is a reason (I believe) for that, IT'S NOT WORTH IT, I'm sorry I didnt use the trial code 1st so I can sell it to someone else. I wasted money on this game. Dont do the same, Use your Trial code 1st if you do buy it, you will see what I mean."
4,A great start!,"This book has a lot of great lesson ideas for teens. If you need a place to start and you're looking for a book to give you weekly lesson ideas with ordinary things, there are some great thought starters in here. I was pleasantly surprized and found a lot of material that I will use over and over. Good purchase!"
2,Two stars may be a bit of a stretch,"This book is absolutely no help. It gives one or two good object ideas but many of them do not fit with a deep spiritual teaching. the book neglects issues of salvation, sin, and the Bible. It is mainly fluff. Many of the objects needed are not common and are hard for a youth pastor to obtain on short notice."
3,GREAT FOR OLDER YOUTH,I PURCHSED BECAUSE IT SOUNDED LIKE IT WAS WHAT I NEEDED FOR MY CHILDREN'S MOMENTS AT CHURCH. THIS IS A GREAT RESOURCE BOOK HOWEVER IT IS GEARED TO OLDER YOUTH. MY CHILDREN ARE BETWEEN 2 AND 10 SO I USED SOME OF THE IDEAS BUT NEEDED TO MAKE THE LESSONS SIMPLER FOR THEM TO UNDERSTAND.
3,Good but tough to read,"This is a hard book to read, it does have some good information in it but you have to dig down to get it. I'm glad however, I have it in my library"
2,Not a real olive oil soap bar,"Don't be fooled by this. Even though it has the words ""Extra Virgin Olive Oil Soap"" on the front and the packaging and soap are all green in color, it's not a real olive oil soap bar. If you buy it thinking you'll get the wonderful moisturizing properties of a typical olive oil bar you'll be sorely disappointed.It lathers up quickly and doesn't feel greasy which is how you can tell it's not an olive oil bar. It might have SOME olive oil, but how much who knows. However much it has it's not enough because it dries out my skin a little. It smells pretty nice though. It has a flowery type scent. For around the same price you can get a real olive oil bar so if that's what you're looking for then definitely pass on this."
1,I overestimated.,"I was happy when I saw that the book had come, but upon opening the package of what was supposed to be the retelling of the Legend of the maiden Fa Mulan, I found a children's picture book. Seriously, my little cousin could read it and she's five."
5,Great eye opener for mortgage hunters!,"Unlike so many hyped-up real estate books, this one delivers. Not every ""secret"" is really a secret, but I think you'll find a wealth of info not covered by any of the other mortgage books that my wife and I have read. We feel we really took a leap forward in the mortgage game."
2,A Romance Writer Adds a Bit of Mystery,"As a voracious mystery-reader I did not find this book very enjoyable. There was an awful lot of cutsy romance novel banter between the main female and male characters which served to make me lower my opinion of their intelligence. I like ""cozies"" but this was way too wordy. Readers who prefer romances may like this book but mystery readers will have to wade through a lot of unnecessary dialogue to get to the plot. I consider it a mediocre padded genre romance with a fairly original mystery added."
2,"Story ok, but writng style is labored","I quite enjoyed it on a wet Sunday afternoon, but the writing style is just too padded out.It isn't really any different from a thousand other books - okay to pass the time, but not a keeper."
3,MILDLY ENTERTAINING,"As a light, fun, easy read, you might pick this for a day at the beach. The protaganist, Hannah, is quite droll, the senior citizen brigade of crime fighters, humorous, the sheriff paramour to Hannah, hunky, and the writing intelligent if not brilliant. A murder mystery ensues around a simple plot and alls well that ends well. Better than most of this genre of book, Suzann Ledbetter can be pleased she shines brighter than most of her contemporaries."
2,How Disappointing,"""Casablanca"" is my favorite movie of all time. I felt extremely happy when I heard that an original soundtrack of Max Steiner's great score was to be released. However, my illusions became shattered when I bought this CD because almost all the dialogue from the movie was included on this Rhino release. I felt so disappointed at that. It would be better to buy the movie instead."
3,Less talk and more rock,"I bought this CD to replace a vinyl recording I had of Humphrey Bogart film scores - more than anything, I wanted the stirring and romantic music from Casablanca. Well...it's here, but my favorite parts are buried under a layer of dialogue from the film. Don't get me wrong, it's great dialogue. But if I wanted to listen to that, I'd just watch the movie. I'm hoping there's a CD available out there that lets Steiner's great music stand on its own."
3,Best movie ever,I wish I had gotten the movie not just the sound track but it is nice. I like the songs on it.
5,A CLASSIC IN EVERY SENSE OF THE WORD.,I BOUGHT THIS SOUNDTRACK BECAUSE WHEN I SAW THE FILM I LIKED IT SO MUCH AND BOY AM I GLAD I DID. THIS IS AWESOME THE SCORE FROM MAX STINER IS BRILLIANT AND I LOVE THE MAIN TITLE AND THE PROLOUGE. IT HAS SUCH AN EFFECT ON ME. I LOVE KNOCK ON WOOD BY DOOLEY WILSON IT IS FUN AND A CATCHEY TUNE ALL OF THIS MUSIC IS WONDERFUL AND I AM GLAD THAT THEY PUT THE DIALOUGE IN IT IT IS SO GOOD. THIS SOUNDTRACK IT A MUST BUY IF YOU LOVE CASABLANCA OR LIKE CLASSICAL MUSIC THIS IS A MUST. THIS MOVIE PUTS FAITH BACK INTO THE MOVIES. WITH ITS EXCELLENT CAST AND MY PERSONAL FAV CLAUDE RAINS. NOWADAYS IN A TIME OF F/X MOVIES YOU WISH THAT THEY WOULD MAKE MOVIES LIKE THIS IT. IF I AM TIRED OF SEEING F/X BLOWOUTS I WILL RENT THIS MOVIE AND I AM RELIEFED THAT IT HAS SUCH A MEMORABLE CAST AND SUCH WITTY SCRIPT. IN IT. AND DON'T FORGET THE MUSIC IT IS WONDERFUL.
5,A Teacher's Gold Mine !!!,"This book is a gold mine of resources for teachers! The Adventures of Mouse Deer has classic folktale characteristics which lend perfectly for teaching this genre. The entertaining storyline is highly motivating for the most reluctant reader. The simple, yet exciting plot make it perfect for practicing retelling, sequence, cause and effect. Because this is a folktale from Malaysia and Indonesia, readers have an authentic reason (and interest!) for research and practicing nonfiction reading strategies and atlas/map-reading. The book has three ""stories"" which are the perfect length for small group reading. The downloadable scripts from Mr. Shephard's website are ideal for the Fluency Station post Guided Reading Group."
5,One of the best Gaither video's ever,"This is one of their best ever. They have all of the greatest songs in southern gospel music. They have everyone from The Happy Goodmans, Ivan Parker, Candy Christmas, and many more. I would highly recommend this video to everyone."
4,Helpful.,"Nice review. However, the competition in the realm of defense/defence economics books is scarce. So don't look around that's it. It provides a balanced and objective description of the economics of defense. It's a bit too old and concetrates on UK. It offers some international comparison, but for that it's better to read some more recent working paper."
3,Good beginners workout,It's a good workout for a beginner. I also like that each one takes about 20 minutes. I usually add some of my own crunches because I do not think there is enough workout for the abs. Overall not bad.
5,"Easy, concise and right to the point","I've been using expressions regular every now and then but I've never understood them well, and this book it's like charm. In a few minutes you can understand them without any problem."
3,Perhaps I missed somthing...,"As a beginner, every little bit helps and I am certainly glad that the ""intelligents"" such as Mr. Forta takes the time to address us who know so much less. Also, I really did enjoy both the ""get to the point"" and brevity of the book but, perhaps I missed something, because I was getting confused between the ""TEXT"" portion of his examples and the ""RESULT"" portions - they were always exactly the same! Once the ""REGEX"" portion was applied against the ""TEXT"", wasn't the ""RESULT"" portion supposed to show only what was filtered? This made the examples meaningless for me. Aside from that, the print quality wasn't there; it seemed that at some point it had become over-xeroxed at the office. Overall, at the very least, I believe the book to be a good primer. I hope to see Mr. Forta follow up somehow. Also, if you get this book, make sure to look up the 19 erratas on his website."
2,Review of Kindle version,"Absolutely useless on an eInk Kindle, as a previous poster has said. The highlighting of results is missing completely when viewing on a Kindle, and hard to see when viewed in the Kindle app on an iPad. So you can't tell what terms the expression has found. It only gets two stars because it is marginally readable on the iPad.You have to wonder if anybody actually looked at this book before offering it for sale."
2,Too Little Information,Way too little information to actually implement the code in any application. Lacks examples of the use regex in any major programming language.
1,Kindle Version is Defective and Unusable,"While the printed version may be a good reference, the Kindle version is formatted improperly to the point that it is renderred useless. You will not be able to see the results of any of the regular expressions. Do not buy. Amazon did, however, issue a refund promptly"
5,Concise and to the point.,this is a great little book. takes you right through regular expressions and has been a good reference. Also has an index that tells you about specific implementations of regular expressions.
2,It tells the time ...but thats all!,"This is a cute clock. (I bought it even after reading the mixed reviews because I thought it was SO CUTE and knowing that my son is gentle with things.) HOWEVER, we had it only a week before the button that toggles between music (radio) on/off/alarm music/buzz broke! So now it is only a clock...no music or alarm. I read several other reviews that said the arms fell off but so far that hasn’t happened to us but they do seem to be a bit too ""delicate"" for a kids' clock. My 5 yr old is happy to have a clock in his room but if I had it to do over again I would have purchased a different clock."
5,Highly Recommended,"These are thoughtful and finely-crafted renderings that bring new life to these very familiar pieces. Northington's playing is poetic and sensitive. So many pianists play these waltzes at breakneck tempos, achieving the virtuosity without the poetry. This recording has a pleasing balance of those two elements; there are moments both of quiet, simple elegance and of exciting virtuosity. Bravo!"
5,A Book of Incredible Value,"For anyone who asks the question: is it me or is it them? This book clearly helps the reader define what any form of abuse is, how and why it happens, and how to protect oneself from abusive people, creating personal and emotional safety. For anyone who suspects they may have been (or possibly are being) abused, this is the book for them. As a Therapist, I recommend this book to adults abused as children, adult children of alcoholics, even people who are in ambivalent relationships and can't figure out why they are still there."
3,pet product,Didn't get to use this. My dog is afraid of the noise and couldn't get her to get used to the sound.
4,mysterious and cold,"a very creative and mysterious album. lots of weird melodies and cold atmosphere...electronics and acoustics meet and meld in these compositions to startling effect. Mimi's vocals are superb and her songwriting approach is unique and intelligent. i would recommended Soak for fans of Bjork or Portishead. i love the cover art, with the translucent jellyfish and strange undersea life forms, it's a good representation of the music contained within."
2,"Oh, I wish I loved this album","Like most of the reviewers so far, I thought Hugo Largo was an AMAZING band. Mimi Goese's unique voice and lyrics are back, but are very overproduced. Hector Zazou, especially, has a way of turning things cold. ""Fire and Roses"" is haunting, playful, and mysterious - but the rest of the album was a great disappointment for a very hopeful fan."
3,Well worth what I paid.,"This is a disc I bought because of the Soundgarden cover, and because I got it for a penny. Overall I do like this album. I would classify it as general electronica, with touches or trip-hop, and simply pop. Somewhere between the likes of Massive Attack and Poe, maybe. As for the cover ""Black Hole Sun"", it's decent, and sounds like what you might think it would. In short, I'm sure I'll play this from time to time, or at least enough for it to really ""Soak"" in. Get it used."
4,Great Help For A Lost Mother Learning About Pagents,I was lost on things to help my daughter win her pagent. I read this with her and she placed at least.
4,beauty pageant manual,This book is good for knowledge enhancement for those who want to enter beauty contest and for break time- reading too.
2,Disappointed with the scent,"I thought the scent would be stronger. I love jasmine and I wanted to use these whenever I bathed. As another reviewer mentioned, these smell no different than plain soap. The paper is decorative, though, so I will keep them."
1,Waste of money. Forgoe the expense.,Waste of money. Put what you would spend on this coverage and put it into a savings account for 2 years and only spend it if whatever you are covering breaks outside of the 1-year manufacturer's warranty. Chances are you'll never spend that money because most major electronics will last longer than the coverage period.
1,i dnt no,"I just purchased my television yesterday. If I bought it yesterday that means its not here yet. SO the plan shouldnt have started yet. I dnt really know if i shouldve purchased this, their customer service is not so great either."
4,Service Plan Arrived Quickly,Haven't had to resort to the service plan yet thankfully but forms arrived promptly after order.
1,Haven't received the warranty yet...,One month later. Still haven't received the papers in the mail. They did send me a reply email to my inquiry this week asking for all of the information that they should have had in file already. Have they lost my purchase record? Hope not. They certainly did charge my credit card promptly...
1,Horrible and Ridiculous.......,"I was really disappointed that I never received this warranty. For two weeks calling the seller asking ""where is my stuff!"". Their response was to call an 800 number that directed me back to amazon. It wasn't worth the headache so I quickly ask amazon for a refund and they did so right away. DON'T BUY THEIR WARRANTIES!! I hate to get the run around, especially for a simple document. I thank Amazon for their patience with me. As for N.E.W., avoid buying from them!! TRUST WHEN I TELL YOU!"
1,"crappy coverage, don't waste your money","I purchased a sony 50 in. wega, and really do love the tv. I purchased this warrenty because in big bold letters, it said it covered 100% coverage and labor for 2 years. WELL a lamp burnt out ($250.00) and they considered that an accesory and would not cover it. I find this plan to be a big waste of my money. Don't bother with it."
3,"Not so good, not so bad","People keep thinkin' that this is an Aphex Twin Cd, and I don't Know why. The Aphex Twin's track is a good music, and the Phillip Glass' orchestration makes it the most classical soundin' music of the album. The Mu-ziq track is also good. In the other trax, there are even beauteful moments, but sometimes it made feel that there was something missing. Ah!, and ""Hip-hop Opera"" should be in other cd."
2,Couldn't get into it,"I can see by looking at this album and his newer stuff that Aphex Twin has evolved with his musical style since this album. Classics is a minimum effort album as far as I can see, just wierd sounds replacing normal drums and breakbeats. Very noisy and detatched. Though its not completly horrible, it comes pretty close."
3,"Extremely childish, but very well-done (for children)","The story is very, very simple and cute, but it's fitted to children, not for adults. It's another fairy tale, with princess, princesses and so on and so forth. What I don't understand is some people judging this movie here as if it was made for adults."
3,"Fantastic Movie Idea, Subpar Execution","I liked the idea of this movie, but I feel it just missed the mark. I love ""fish out of water"" movies and was hoping this would be a musical version of ""Elf."" At times it tried to be cute rather then funny, but came off as cheesy. That happens when you get the guy who directed ""102 Dalmatians."" Amy Adams was great and James Marsden was cast well, but Susan Sarandon was wasted and Patrick Dempsey forgetable. I will say, it is much better then ""Cool World."""
5,Great show for little ones and adults,Our four year old daughter has watched it three times since we purchased the DVD. Prior to purchasing we rented twice so we are now getting our money's worth. Both the little girls and big girls enjoy this cartoon/live acting fairy tale.
5,Enchanted!,"Love the costuming, the story, and the singing! Just delightful. I sing along and have a great time, every time. Adore Amy Adams' character!"
5,Makes an Enchanting Gift!,"My mother, who is in her 80's is delighted with the film ""Enchanted."" We are a family who LOVE film and now that Mom is older and not so prone to head out to the theater, I love see her enjoy movies at home. She says that the DVD is a great treat and now can watch it at will instead of looking for it to appear on television.Thank you for your speedy service. We also enjoy the opportunity to buy used DVDs especially in these very expensive days!"
5,The Best Disney Movie EVER~~~,It's a favorate! Great movie that both child and parent can enjoy together. Great acting - great music!Fantastic!!!!
5,Awesome and adorable movie!,There is not a soul in our house who doesn't get a kick out of this movie-from the 3 year old boy to the 41 year old Mom. We saw it at the theater and had to have it for my 8 year-old's birthday and we have watched it over and over.
4,Enchanted,"I went to the movies to see Enchanted and couldn't wait until it came out on DVD to buy it, which I did via Amazon. It is a feel good movie. I could watch it again and again."
5,Family Pleaser,This film is excellent all the family enjoy watching it. The tunes are very catchy our boys aged 2 and 5 sing them all the time. A must buy for any one who enjoys Disney films
5,Can a story book romance survive the real world?,"The little girl in every woman will want to see ""Enchanted,"" over and over. Amy Adam's as the storybook character Giselle brings this movie to life!"
5,Enchanted....,"Such a good movie. We loved it. It has all you want in a fun teen movie. Love, evil stepmother, handsome prince, and a plot that keeps you guessing until the end. Sweet, sweet movie. Kudos to Disney for this one!Giselle finds the prince of her dreams but the old hag sends her to New York to keep from losing her crown by the upcoming marriage to the prince."
5,The Best Ever,This is the best movie ever! Beware....too much watching of it causes memorization of songs resulting in the constant singing of them......A must for a DVD library!
4,"Amy Adams brought me here, but it's a pleasant surprise all around","I thought Amy Adams deserved an Oscar nomination for this performance. Then again, I'm biased - though I ended up enjoying ""Enchanted"" quite a bit, what drove my initial interest was Adams' appearance. [If you want to know why, go rentJunebug.] She's excellent here as a Snow White-like 'Giselle'. It's also a treat to see strong-jawed beauty, Idina Menzel. True Broadway royalty, Ms. Menzel is both the original Maureen inRentand the original Elphaba in 'Wicked'. If 'Wicked' does make it to the screen and Idina Menzel is not Elphaba, someone needs to go to jail.Disney does a great job here at getting a two-level movie in the DNA of a Pixar's best work. It appeals to kids on one level, adults on another. We convinced a number of our friends to go after seeing it and realizing how well done it was."
4,A modern happily ever after.,"Enchanted starring Amy Adams and Patrick Dempsey is a cute Disney flick for all ages. James Marsden and Susan Sarandon also star and steal the show. Adams's performance is a bit annoying but her angelic voice and adorable charisma is the perfect recipe to play a sweet, doe-eyed princess. Dempsey is pretty good in this as well, he's more than McDreamy guys! This movie is part animation and live action, I like the songs and ending. Give this charming fairytale a chance, enjoy!"
5,Disney fans will love it,"If you are a big fan of Disney, you may enjoy this movie. It's a (mostly) live-action fairy tale movie. There are some animated bits as well. The plot is somewhat predictable, but it's still great. It makes you feel good inside. =) The songs are catchy too!"
4,More pleasant than enchanting....,"You have to think that Disney realized that they were setting the bar pretty high for themselves, when they decided to parody themselves. In an age of Scary Movie, Not Another Teen Movie, etc. perhaps it was the wisest thing to do, before the image they have built up for years was reduced to toilet humor and fart jokes.Being a Disney movie their riffing on themselves while enjoyable, was still a little too syrupy sweet.Adams is wonderful as Giselle, and while not an Academy Award winning performance, still one that had me believing in her doe-eyed innocence and sincerity. One never knew that by the end a stereotypical Disney princess could turn out to be so sexy.If you are a long time Disney fan, you'll enjoy picking out the parallel scenes to Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast, etc.A worthwhile way to spend and afternoon or evening.Cheers!"
4,Fun movie!!,"It's a Disney film with a good sense of self-deprecation and healthy dose of cynicism. The squirrel is funny and the CGI is well done. Yes, it is somewhat sappy, but I classify it as a good family film that everyone can enjoy more than once."
4,A good family movie.,The movie is sure to thrill the young ones. Though the movie deals with complexity of emotions that are prevalent in real life it does so in a candy wrapper of a fairy tale. If it wasn't for the fairy tale factor the story would have been a run of the mill drama.Kudos to Amy adams who plays the part of the fairy tale princess lost in the real world and has the calibre to make it believable.All in all a 4 star movie for the family to enjoy.
5,Great birthday present,"Along with ""Stargate: The Ark of Truth,"" this was a present for my wife's birthday. She loved both (and so did I). Both of us grew up on Disney movies, so to see a loving, light-hearted spoof of that genre (by Disney, no less) was a real treat. Amy Adams constitutes the best honest realization of a total fantasy person since Christopher Reeve in the first Superman movie. She is a delight, and her singing is truly magical. The rest of the cast supported her admirably. I heartily recommend this movie!"
5,Giselle is my Hero,"Loved the movie - probably more than my 4 year old daughter whos' life long dream is to be a ""real princess"". Has a great ending and just cute all around."
4,DVD review,I haven't seen this film in the theater so I was kind of hesitated to buy Blu-ray and ended up with buying dvd.In factm the dvd quality is good. They might used HD telecine for sure.The movie is very strange but very fun to watch.It's like Nurse Betty + Roger Rabbit.Amazing to watch even if you are not a kid.
3,"Buddy the Elf is back....wait, no...","I think this movie would have been loads better about five years ago. After Elf, which I happen to love, I can't help but think of this as a bit copy-cat. You know, the naive character who gets sent to New York City, where they can't understand anything because they're from la-la land.The choice to make it a musical also alienated me a bit, because the songs are all really annoying (It's no Sound of Music.)And beyond that, do you know how positively ANNOYING it is to have your sisters talking about how cute Patrick Dempsey is!?!?!?!?!? ""McDreamy this, McDreamy that..."" AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! The guy isn't that good looking, alright!?!?!?Unless you are an easily amused child, or a female, you'd probably be better off doing something else...like watching Elf.Two and a Half stars. One for James Marsden's good performance, one for Timothy Spall's good performance, and a half because they didn't make the movie any longer."
5,Love this movie!,This movie is not just for kids. I enjoy it every time I watch it. The music and dancing is wonderful and the actors are well cast.
4,Did not like the final scenes,Other than that.. It was a very funny and entertaining movie. Have watched it a least 4 times and each time I enjoy it more. Safe to see with Children for a change
5,Love,"Fantastic move. I absolutely love musicals. And while this is kind of cheesy, it's cheesy in a good way. Definitely one of my family's new favorites!"
5,Loved it! A nice modern non anamated fairytale.,Love James Marsden! He is a great actor and hot to! Really liked how they tied the anamated story to the real world in NYC very cool!
4,Delightful,"This is a great and charming predictable family movie. Amy Adams simply steals the entire movie with her wit, voice, and sweetness. James Marsden also is very entertaining and comical as the prince. I know this movie will endure endless repeated viewings for several children as The Princess Bride was for me."
5,Jamie,"I ordered this DVD in hopes that I would receive one that was good enough to watch.When I received it, I opened the package and looked at the DVD and it looked just like new.You could say that I'm well pleased with it.Thanks Jamie"
5,Surprisingly Great,"I did not go see this in theaters because, to be honest, I thought it looked ridiculous. Now that I have seen it, it was so entertaining! Hilarious with a good hearted plot, I enjoyed it from beginning to end. The singing voices are superb as well. I highly recommend for anyone who also has a light heart and enjoys romantic comedies. Love lives on!"
5,Another keeper.,Great movie for the whole family to watch together- not too many like that out there any more.
4,Delightful,"This is a delightful parody on several fairy tale classics. I thought it well done that they didn't spend every second making fun of other tales, but developed this one sufficiently to be an enjoyable story. And the production number in NYC was a lot of fun. It's great to see a big production number done like that again, a real smiler. I think we will enjoy pulling this one out as a family many times for many years to come."
4,Good movie,The movie was great. I really liked the idea of the animation and live action. In the whole tradition of Disney princesses
4,Hilarious,My wife and I love this movie. It's definitely one to watch if you want to have a date night with the Mrs.
5,Great movie!,"I missed ""Enchanted"" when it was at the movie theater, so this was a must-have movie for me. My granddaughters and I have watched it at least five (5) times since I purchased it! (They are into princesses right now). I recommend this movie to anyone who has a ""princess"" collection going right now."
1,Downhill Disney,"Disney films have pretty much gone downhill since the ""Hunchback of Notre Dame"" animated movie. In that film, the heroine kicks men in the groin to make her escape and the comedy relief is provided by a stone gargoyle that relieves itself by passing gas.In this film, we have a live dog urinating on the leg of a prince and a chipmunk that defecates when frightened.Is this what passes for family entertainment these days?"
3,A real-world fairy tale,"This is an excellent movie for the entire family where the folks at Disney parody their own animated fairytale favorites. The movie opens in traditional, Disney animation. Then it switches to live action when the location changes to a place where happy endings never happen--New York City. The movie's plot is made believeable by the outstanding performance of Amy Adams who never once falls out of character as a fairytale princess-to-be."
3,Ok movie...,"I was a little disappointed with this movie. Yes, its definately cute and had its funny parts but overall I'm glad I didnt spend money on a movie ticket."
4,A giddy look at all the fairy tale conventions,"The music and magic of this tale is in the way it tweaks all the conventions of Disney movie princesses. Amy Adams is good as the princess who comes to terms with humanity, yet retains her optimism and desire for ""true love."""
4,Very entertaining,"This had a nice touch of both Disney animated and live action, making it a very funny and enjoyable movie"
5,Delight for adults and chldren......................................,"My granddaughters have seen this at least three times, and cannot get enough of it. But, then and again, neither can their grandparents. It is an absolute delight to watch them, and we enjoy it as much. They laugh, gasp, clap and just love it.The story, though not frightening , keeps them guessing and cheering. We highly suggest this movie, for fun and laughter.ENCHANTED"
2,Just Didn't Work,The idea for this movie seemed fun but the execution really fell flat. It wanted to be satirical but it just couldn't bring itself to let loose and do it. Took itself too seriously and was predictable. My whole family was disappointed. Watching Shrek 3 again would have been more entertaining.
2,Not quite Disney best,"I'm not sure what, but something could have been done to make it more 'Disney-like"""
5,Enchanted,This was rec'd in perfect condition. The movie enchanted is great for both children and adults it is a fairly tale love story that can be shared by everyone in the family.
4,Entertaining and different,"This movie was funny, and poked at movie stereotypes - the princess/maiden waiting for her Prince, the happily ever after schtick, the evil stepmother, and the like. My only complaint is that there wasn't much background for Andalasia. Was Gisselle truly a Princess or not? What happened to the Prince's father? And the like.The real-life part was rather amusing. Gisselle was just adorable, and seeing the fairy-tale gestures done by a real-life actress instead of a cartoon counterpart was rather amusing, especially when she starts singing, and the creatures in the city - like the pigeons and even the COCKROACHES! - come in to help her with such and such. Everyone did great jobs in their roles, especially the Andalasian characters because of their exaggerated gestures and breaking out in song at seemingly random intervals. If you're looking for a fun and entertaining fairytale to watch, this is for you."
4,fairy tale,"It's a disney style fairy tale. It has a similar feel to the movie ""Elf"" It's a good movie"
4,Blu-Ray version features Interactive game,"The Blu-Ray version includes an Interactive Game called ""D-Files"". The game uses BD-Java to integrate trivia challenges throughout the film that tests you on all of the various references to past Disney films. When you answer a question correctly, you are treated to various clips, several which play homage to past Disney films."
4,I am Enchanted by Amy Adams,Just love Amy Adams ever since I saw her in Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day and this is a silly but fun movie. Everybody in the park joining into her song and dance was my favorite part!
5,Delightful -- Topnotch,"I don't normally prefer comedies, and I like musicals even less. So when my spouse suggested we see Enchanted, I was anticipating a nap as the only escape. But this film was a delight from the opening frame, and I enjoyed every minute. It even has a moving and satisfying love story. I hadn't even heard of Amy Adams before this movie, but I absolutely could not imagine anyone playing this role better. A splendid, sparkling performance, memorable. The male leads are only a notch above adequate, but they don't get in the way of a five star viewing experience overall."
4,"Great ""Feel Good"" movie","I loved this movie! I, however, love fantasy and am a diehard romantic. If you enjoy movies which are a little bit fairy tale and a little bit romance, where good triumps over evil and leaves you feeling happy and uplifted, this is for you! If you prefer, as my best friend does, blood, guts & horror and can't stand the thought of impromptu song and dance scenes that just magically happen in the middle of your movie, not so much I'm afraid. I personally think big kids and little ones alike can enjoy this one."
5,Enchanted as a gift,"The Blue Ray version was given as a birthday gift. I have seen blu-ray and they are very clear, the colors are crisper and the quality is so much better. As for the story itself: this is a very funny movie. It is a fairy tale that is much more reality than make believe. A must see for all ages.Enchanted (Widescreen Edition)"
4,From scratch,"This was a good book and a quick read.Being targeted to technical audience, it should have included at least some architectural flowsheet and deeper explanations. Photos are also of very poor quality. For this reason I rate it 3,5 stars.One aspect I found especially interesting is that the book clearly shows how the biggest advances in technology are made when you're free to start fresh without any constraint on compatibility ( a road Intel never followed )Being part of the players during those days must have been really fascinating."
4,Beautiful but...,"This product is wonderful, beautiful, easy for my 2 year old to play with, however. I f your child still chews on toys you may want to wait. This puzzle is paper glued onto the wood instead of being painted like most of M&D products, so chewers can actually eat the paper off. I realize that this is not a flaw in the product, just that my daughter may still be a little young to play with it properly. Overall I love this puzzle and pretty much anything created by M&D. I would highly recommend for 3-4+."
3,Kinda boring,My kids (1 1/2 and 2 1/2) are just not interested in this puzzle. The bigger pieces and the fact it goes up to 20 are the only real highlights of this puzzle for us.
3,Age Appropriate,"I have 2 year old triplets who LOVE puzzles and we really love Melissa & Doug's chunky puzzle series. One of the triplets is starting to learn his numbers and letters so I was very excited to get this puzzle. The puzzle itself is the usual great Melissa & Doug quality. However, it says it's for 3 year olds and I would probably keep it at that age because it really requires some number recognition. The pieces ""fit"" in several different places, and since they are numbers (not as exciting as a dog or cow), there isn't the instant recognition of the image. My autistic son (one of the triplets), who can do all of the other Melissa & Doug chunky puzzles, got very frustrated with this one because he learns by figuring out what fits and THEN learns to associate the image with each space. This puzzle will go into the ""try it again later"" pile."
4,Awesome,It turned out a very good learning toy for my 2 year old daughter. The numbers are large enough for her to pick and identify and pictures are interesting. She now speaks and identify 1 to 20.
4,Great for my students,I teach mentally handicapped adults in a local community college. A durable wooden puzzle like this one is a god send for me and my students. I strongly recommend this puzzle if you want a durable puzzle that you can have your students work over and over again like I do. Definitely worth getting.
3,Disappointing Melissa & Doug Puzzle,"I bought this puzzle for my 2 year old. She loves the Melissa & Doug alphabet puzzle, and it really helped her learn letters and how to do a puzzle. So, I wanted to build on that and help her with her numbers. The big disappointment with this puzzle is that there are multiple places where a number can fit. (ie, she can put the #16 in the #19 spot). So, it doesn't really help with the ""puzzle skills"". And since some of the pieces fit anywhere, she's not really motivated to try to find where the piece really goes."
2,Low Quality M&D Not What I Paid For,"Although Amazon shipped this much quicker than I expected, it is not what was pictured nor what Melissa & Doug used to sale. I have a number of Melissa & Doug puzzles that are painted on ALL sides. The older puzzles are made of real wood and feel much nicer than this pressed board crap. They are also cut to the image where the newer puzzles are mere outlines, haphazardly thrown together. I would have promptly returned this puzzle, but my 19 month old son really loves puzzles and saw this and the other 2 puzzles as they were coming out of the box. I cannot believe that these cost the same amount or more than the other puzzles we own, yet they are of such an inferior quality that I cannot believe the are trying to pawn it off as the same thing they used to sale. Shame on you Melissa & Doug."
3,Too bad the numbers fit into many spots,"My 2.5 year old is getting really into numbers, so I thought she would love this puzzle, however, when it arrived and she proudly proclaimed she had finished it I looked over and discovered that while all of the numbers were completely inside the holes, they were not all in the appropriate spot. It is too bad that so many of them can fit into the spots that are not correct. She does enjoy it, but the usefulness of this puzzle is greatly diminished by the fact that the shapes can be placed in the wrong order."
3,Nice puzzle to learn numbers,"My son already has a Melissa and Doug chunky letter puzzle so I bought him this one so he can learn numbers. He loves standing the numbers up and putting it in together but he didn't really play with this puzzle as much as the letter puzzle. For some reason, he preferred the letter puzzle more."
3,"Good quality, but no Zing","These are very good quality hard candies. Well packaged, and with very few broken pieces. The flavor is very mild, more like a honey flavored cough drop with just a hint of lemon. Personally, I'm looking for something with more zing to it, so I'll have to keep looking."
2,"A ""Lightweight"" Chain, ""Heavyweight"" Price...","I have another H-D Chain link keychain/wallet holder that IS quality...IMO this one is NOT! A very lightweight chain, a thin Stamped out Skull and many areas that needed to be soldered before I was comfortable hanging my keys off it while flying down the highway, I should have sent it back...."
4,Sexy and comfy,"This product exceeded my expectations, it's actually comfortable and makes me feel extremely sexy just to have it on. The fabric is soft and light decreasing visibility marks under your clothes.The only con is a silky string that ties in the back which must be tied up tightly otherwise it'll let loose and tickle your legs and possibly show itself if your wearing a skirt.btw my bf gives it a 5 star though!"
5,A cut above,"These are sensational. I have given my girlfriend crotchless panties before, but most were thong-style. The fabric in the back was an added turn-on that did not diminish access. The picture does not do them justice -- they are even sexier."
3,it's hot (crotchless is always hot anyway) but sizing is off,"the panties seems so hot on the picture and having the fact that i got some buns, thought that it would be a good idea to buy this. however when i received the item, the sizing is a bit bigger than normal. i have to tie it so much so that it's not loose. also, the quality of the ribbon is not good and it's colored pink (even though it's supposed to be white as well)! the quality of lace is so-so. for the price i paid, quality should be better just like the panties i buy from VS."
4,Sexy and comfortable,This is a great item that fit well. I wore them on a plane which I don't exactly recommend as it was interesting using the airplane restroom and sitting for long periods. My husband thought they were great too!The black and pink is a very sexy look.
2,"Boring, Weired, Bad","I loved Anne Stuart's Ice series,I loved some of her ""Dangerous"" books, but Ritual Sins cannot be counted in this group. I don't know how this happens to a gifted story teller, nevertheless Ritual Sins is preposterous, one-dimensional, and simply weired.One prolem is that the writing is shallow: instead of getting to know the heroes thru their actions, thoughts, emotions, we are told what those thoughs and emotions are, with great repetition. Instead of showing us who they are, we are told ""She is frigid"", ""He is bored"", etc. It left me cold and un-invloved. At the same time the story line is so preposterous, most of the times the heroes themselves don't know why they are doing what they are doing... so how can we identify with them??!I didn't grow to like them, I didn't believe in the love story, I just wanted it to end."
2,Very difficult to get in the mood.,"This book falls way short of a romance novel. I ordinarily love the time travel to a romantic land and a handsome Celt storyline. This story made it difficult to get into the mood, when the heroine of the book is in essence having an affair with a married man about to become a father. The actual time passage scenairo was very vague and loosely written, and I don't know about you, but when I am fantacizing about a gorgeous hunk of a man, I wan't him AVAILABLE, not in essence, cheating on his pregnant wife.(No matter what the customs of Beltane dictate.) Definately a turn off. The end does not justify the means in this story."
2,Err..,I`m sorry i really didn`t like this book at all. it was boring and i coudn`t stand the way ' Lasarian/Ian' acted or how Shannon was acting like such an airhead. give me a break. i don`t really reccomend this book but if you have nothing better to do then hey whatever floats your boat.
5,Not for beginners,"To the 2 folks who gave the book a 1 star. It is not a book for people who are new to the industry, people with little mathematical background, or for beginners. The book is more or less straight forward for people who come from physics or optics backgrounds and have had at least 1 year of graduate school. In fact, there are quite a few useful and practical things in this book both for component and systems designers. I have found this book to be excellent both in industry and in academic environments. I highly recommend this book."
1,Do not buy this book,"If you are a beginner or student who has little or no knowledge of fiber optics and intends to understand it, do not buy this book. This book has only briefs on theories and lacks on application."
2,Looked cute on model but not on me,"The cut of the pant was way to low, and the top way to short. The fabric was ok.I had to send them back, which was not a problem."
1,Never mind the title!,"Never mind the title! This historical oddity is an extended essay offering ""scientific"" and religious reasons that the earth must be flat! Visit the National Center for Science Education --Defending the Teaching of Evolution in the Public Schoolshttp://www.ncseweb.org/"
1,Not so great,Very cheep plastic. The lid arrived cracked. Amazon did refund my purchase. But it was still very disappointing.
3,Good for its time,"This book was written in the 1960s so many facts were not presented, such as MM's alleged affairs with the Kennedys. The author did not know MM so he presents MM from a distance: a hard-working, neurotic, promiscuous, fearful actress who eventually committs suicide. Now we know that MM's life is much more complex with many more questions about her death. Still, Hoyt tries to get to the real person behind the public mask. If you can locate this hard-to-find book, I think you'll find his perspective fascinating."
5,Bird Brain Blooms :),"These Bird Brains chairs look GREAT and are super quality. The cypress wood and urethane coating really hold up. I live in harsh climate of northern Vermont and they sit out from mid-April to mid-October and frequently getted snowed on. I have two of these chairs that are 3 years old....and this is the first summer that I have had to refresh the urethane coating. The paint color snapped right back with the fresh urethane. Incidentally, they sit great and everyone always comments on them as they sit surrounded by wildflowers."
1,hate,I hate this thing VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VE RY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY MUCH
1,Rust Warning...,"Apparently the so called 'nickel' finish turns to rust after a few months. Nothing in the paperwork mentioned anything about possible rust if a sealer was not put on the finish. Normally Harly Davidson products are pretty durable. This item must've been made in another country, if you get my drift."
2,Seems good...at first.,"I bought this clip for my Dad for Fathers Day. It seemed like a good clip, is strong and doesn't bend, however, the nickle finish is poor quality and within weeks was prone to rust. Eventually the entire clip rusted making for dirty money, pockets and hands. Great idea. Love the Harley branding, but the finish is crap."
4,Very Cool!,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loved it. It is pretty tight but will loosen up as you use it.
4,Very Good Mate in one book,"I must disagree with the other review. . . I have been teaching chess for years and while I also use a number of excellent books by Wilson and Alberston, I found the checkmates in this text excellent and creative. I recommend the book to beginning chess players."
1,Avoid,"I always look for interesting novice books for my chess teaching purposes. This is not such a book. It serves its purposes, but other books have already adequately covered this niche in chess publishing.Reinfeld, as well as Wilson and Albertson, have written better books on checkmates. Buy those. Don't buy this."
1,makes my hair limp,"I don't get people who have curly hair wanting to straighten it out. This product doesn't claim to do that, but it might as well. Instead of support for my curls, I get heavy limpness. Not a good look."
5,I get compliments when I use this product,"Curly Sexy Hair Curling creme works fabulously!!!First, you have to know your hair (curls have a mind of their own) and also know how to style your mane. I've searched and bought various curling creme products yet many do not really enhance the curl. Through trail and error, I found the best method for me:1) Styling after I wash my hair: I use an ultra light oil/water spray called Miracle 7 then use Curly Sexy Hair creme2) Daily styling in-between washes: Daily conditioning then an application of Curly Sexy Hair followed by a a crispy-creme to set the curls without the crunchiness of a drying gel. Alagio worked but the I cannot find this product anymore.(Since Curly Sexy hair creme is hard to find in shops and salons, another hair curling product that works is Miss Jessie's Pillow Soft Curls)"
5,It is sexy!,"This styling creme is really nice for my natural curly longish hair! It helps the curls stay neat and shiny. When I let it dry naturally, it's a controlled curly and pretty look. If I dry it with a defuser, it can get big, curly and full, which is just how I like it."
3,Makes hair SOFT - but doesn't really control the frizz,I love how soft my hair feels with this product but the frizz is still there.. it's almost 'fly away' frizz too.. not sexy at all! I actually think that the sleek look works better than this for curls and it makes my hair soft too.. so going to that!
2,It was ok.,I was not so crazy about the smell of it and it did not give much curl to my hair either. I was disappointed...
2,The search continues....,"I just tried this product this morning and it's is so going back to the store! My curls have turned into saggy waves and my hair is frizzier than I've ever seen it. Too bad. Being able to get this at my local drug store or online at Amazon.com made it a front runner as I seem to like products you can only get if you go into the back alley knock three times in succession on the door w/ the updside down letter K on it and then knock four more times and wait for John to answer and tell him Joe sent you.Oh well... back to the drawing board. This one doesn't define curl, enhance curl or eliminate frizz. Bummer. Maybe if I add a few more products into the mix but that's not my goal. I'd like to find one all encompassing product that will define the curl, enhance the curl and control the frizz."
5,ESSENTIAL MINGUS,"contains all mingus'surviving atlantic material. it has the album that made me a jazz fan(pithecanthropus erectus) and other great stuff with knowledgable writers putting in good essays.the only sad thing is the unreleased material that we'll never get to hear due to the atlantic records tape storage facility fire which destroyed all their 1948-1969 session master tapes,the only surviving masters are the album and single mixdown masters.i think it's one american music's greatest losses."
5,I love Palmers,"I swear by Palmers and tell everyone I know to use it. I gained 61 pounds during my pregnancy, used Palmers every day twice a day and I do not have one stretch mark! I owe it to Palmers and will always use them! Try their diaper rash cream too - it's great!"
3,Great in some ways but not all,"I just wanted to share my experience with this stuff. I love the oil! It works wonderfully and works in a pinch for those moments of extreme itchiness. The creams work very well but there's something about the lotion smell that would make me feel so sick each time I used it. It didn't bother me at first but the more I used the lotion the more the smell got to me. It doesn't smell anything like coco butter, even though I'm not a big fan of coco butter smells I would take that over the current smell of the lotion. The cream smells a little better and I think over all it does a good job, but I just wanted to put out a warning that the smell isn't for everyone. I ended up just giving in to the price and buying the Mustela nine months, which to me smells a million times better and is very soothing."
2,Not so Provocative...,"The ""third-side"" idea of Ury's book was a neat one. I think that his idea of recognizing a third-side, may it be another person/people or a motivating force, and allowing it to assist in nonviolent conflict resolution is neat in that it helps us individually recognize the will to 'resolve'. I just don't know if that whole idea is actually that stimulating.There is an over-simplification in his methodologies which proved to be a significant downfall of this book. Much of his examples were underdeveloped and it seems as if he molds the examples to fit his opinion, instead of his opinion fitting into the examples. The major dissappointment for me in the book was that he writes of other people and other cultures through the employment of racist techniques and makes it seem as though every conflict is simple enough that it can eventually just be ""talked out""."
2,Does not show you how,This book just say that you should settle your disputes with methods such as mediation and negitiation but teach not tell you how you can do it.A disappointment.
5,"Excellent collection of 16 (8 Swing, 3 Lindy, 5 Jitterbug)","An excellent collection of 16 songs. The first 8 are Swing, including Think, Chain of Fools (Aretha Franklin); Ability to Swing (Patti Austin); Hot Coffee (Carl Anderson). The next 3 are Lindy, including My Boyfriend's Back (Melissa Manchester). the last 5 are Jitterbug and Jive, with Jive After Five (Carl Perkins), Trickle Trickle (Manhattan Transfer), and Why Do Fools Fall In Love (Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers)."
5,dance cd,"It was a gift, although it arrived with a broken cd case the recipient was thrilled to death~~which might have been bad since it was for his 80th birthday!!"
1,pardon the putative cynicism,"This album is a compilation of competent cuts of good classics which individually and collectively appear to represent the title, but in general, each piece is far from the center as a representative of each genre. To an accomplished dancer this may work or even be exactly what you are looking for. To a novice this album is the pits."
1,Shoot the kazoo player,"The music might be very good, too bad I couldn't make it past the third track. Somehow a lunatic with a kazoo managed to find his way on stage and ruin the entire recording. I'm glad I checked this out from the library instead of buying it."
4,Bravura and Tenderness in One,"Tokyo 96' is an excellent LP for any fan of the Jazz Piano. Jarrett's volcalizations never intrude on the wonderful music, making this album accesible for anyone. The trio's ability to communicate only gets better with age, and this is one of their peaks. While the moodful melodies and ballads are truly stunning on this album, the spotlight is stolen by Jarrett simply digging into some up-tempo bop standards. Highlights? The entirety of Billie's Bounce and I'll Remember April are ecstatic (the latter featuring a marvelous drum-solo intro punctuated by rhythmic chords on behalf of Jarrett), however, the true gem is the brief, almost frantic and assuredly intense John's Abbey. One can almost see the sparks flying from these three masteful musicians!"
5,My Funny Valentine/Song...,"I love Jarrett, love his Standards Trio, love this album...but I had to throw down a note about the last track.Even though ""My Funny Valentine"" has been covered by so many over the years, this is my single most favorite performance of MFV by anyone. It's just a perfect transcendent moment. And Keith doesn't even play the whole melody.. it's as if he lets the listener who knows the tune so well fill in the gaps for himself/herself. Sublime. Perfect.This trio is a force of Nature, and here's yet more proof."
4,A Magical Spell,"Many jazz lovers probably already have several CDs by this outstanding trio in their collections; if so, they will pretty well know what to expect. Jarrett, Peacock, and DeJohnette have worked together so long and are such accomplished musicians that the music just seems to flow right out of them. Covering standards (e.g., ""It Could Happen to You,"" I'll Remember April,"" Autumn Leaves,"" My Funny Valentine'), the trio blurs the line between arrangement and improvisation, weaving quite a magical spell as they work their way through 79 minutes' worth of music.As always, Jarrett's piano sounds slightly clangy, and he adds his usual shouts and groans to the mix, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. With so many CDs now to choose from featuring this group, Tokyo `96 might not be an indispensable recording, but it is nonetheless a sterling example of ""the art of the trio."""
3,"Great music, bad vocalizing","I fully support most of the positive reviews of this album, but I must say the buzzing and moaning and chanting in the background is difficult to bear."
4,none,"30 of today's SF writers put their take and imaginations on stories based on the songs of the innumerably talented Janis Ian. An unusual and interesting, entertaining and satisfying collection, with Ian proving that's she's not only a terrific songwriter, but can write SF with the best of them."
2,Not for a tough job,"This is an economy blade and it lasted as such. It didn't make it through a whole day of concrete cutting for us. If you just need to cut a single area and not much in depth, this might work for you and save you some money as well. This price was great, but it is actually one of the worst economy blades we've used. If you need a long lasting tough blade, go ahead and buy one of the more expensive, premium blades. This won't do the job."
3,Great functionality but buggy,"If you've spent the money on a Nikon camera that takes NEF (RAW) format, and you are a serious photographer, you should spend the money on this product.The power of Capture is awesome and the user interface is very intuitive--unlike Adobe Photoshop/Elements. Best of all, any changes that you make to a NEF file can be undone, so your original image is always available.The bad news is that the program has a nasty habit of crashing, so save your changes frequently and be prepared to reload as needed. Another problem that I have had is that Nikon technical support is not at all knowledgeable about the software. If your question is not one of the basic ones for which Nikon can email back a ""canned response"" you are on your own. The manual is pretty good, and as noted above, the program generally does what you expect it to do. Never the less, Nikon should support it better and improve the reliablity of the software."
4,The best first step,"In my opinion Capture does a better job of initial adjustment to a photo (NEF or JPEG) than photoshop and it is much easier to use. There are no masks or complicated steps to adjust sharpness, hue, saturation, etc. You just click on a spot you want corrected and adjust the corresponding sliders that appear. Two downsides: You have to set your photo printer as the default- there is no printer list (why I don't know at this stage). Second, there are no tools to heal or make other effects as with PS. But that is not the purpose of Capture. It is designed to work with other programs by first preparing your raw or jpeg, and it does a great (and best of all) easy job of it far better than Photoshop alone."
2,INTEL MAC and Capture 4.4,"I purchased this product from the Specs given, It would not even install on the new Intel Macs. After calling Nikon support they advised there was nothing that they could do, that I would just have to wait and see if they was going to provide an upgrade to this product. Yet their specs only called for OS 10.3.1 or Later and 256 MB of ram. Not one word here or on their web site in the specs about this not working on the new Macs. They later sent me a link to their FAQ page about the Intel Macs. Luckily I had a power book that I could install it on so my dollars were not a total loss. BEWARE IF YOU HAVE A NEW INTEL MAC. UPDATE Nikon refunded my money for this item since their web site ws not clear on the equipment, The new Capture NX works with the Intel machines."
1,Roxio's Easy Media Creator is much better than this!,"It doesn't get the job done, if you're looking for usable digital photo editing, etc."
1,Does not run on Xeon processor,"I own a Capture 4.1. I wanted to install on my Dell Precision 690. I was able to install it, together with an upgrade on the install disk, but when I tried to run it, I got a BSOD saying ""an attempt was made to execute a non executable memory"". It is the only program which does not run on my computer, and the only one which gave me a BSOD in the last 5 years. Unfortunately I cannot give 0 or less stars for such a buggy program."
1,Horrible!,Do not buy these pens. I think I was able to write on three CDs with each one before they completely dried up.
2,I didn't listen to the other reviews...,"I figured for $50 it couldn't be THAT bad, I bought- assembled it and of course, like everyone else, my tray was cracked and it is not a very sturdy pen. I would not recomment it. It looks nice put together though."
1,Extremely poor quality,"I ordered this to confine a 22 lb dog while I am at work. The item arrived the very next day, and although the box was not particularly damaged, the plastic floor tray was cracked and broken in multiple places. I returned it and ordered a replacement, which also arrived quickly, but in the same condition. I never did get to unpack the rest of the crate, but it's labeled in Chinese and packaged with Chinese assembly instructions - um, that could be a problem for at least some non-Chinese consumers. Overall, an inferior product. Don't waste your time."
5,"Here is your fix, you goddamn Hendrix junkies!! (myself included)","This is one hot DVD!! Performed by world class artists who are all famous in their own right, you know they themselves have to be Hendrix junkies to perform like this. Ignore the many ""Foo Foo"" reviewers who like to nit pick according to their own personal prejudices, just trust me... if you are a Hendrix junkie then before you have finished viewing this DVD you will fall to your knees in praise of this historic tribute to Hendrix. It's that good!! OMG !! Lay your hand on the DVD and say, ""Hey man!!!"""
4,"A GREAT MELODIC CD , FROM A GREAT NEW BAND","These guys impressed me , this cd is really good , great songs , hooks , etc --- Overall great , also check out this cool cd , SUGARBOMB - "" BULLY "" ---- awsome !!!!"
2,Typical,"It's alright. But why is it that all these recent pop-rock albums like 3 Doors Down, Oleander etc. just blend together after the second song. I think Matchbox 20 is really the only recent mainstream rock band that has released a couple of solid albums."
1,WHY DOES EVERYONE RATE SO HIGH!? This is lame!,"I have spent weeks looking up hundreds of small bands and auditioning them. Sad to say this is one of those bands with little talent but nothing that seperates them from many dozens of other groups that sound just the same. They aren't ones I want to add to my collection.During these days of auditioning, I have noticed one thing. 98% of bands have been ranked somewhere between a 4.5 and 5. This is monotonous. I can't understand why every band rates so high with so little talent and nothing different. It makes reviews garbage basically. People please get off the 5 star buttons and reserve it for your favorites only! I can't even get a clue by reading reveiws so I have to write my own. Hopefully this will help someone out there wondering why this group rates so high but sounds so lame. For you people left still handing out 2's and 3's for run of the mill music my hats off to you and carry on the good work!"
3,Be careful...,"This product works very well. just like the OEM version.there are 3 problems i've encountered with this product1) on the first pack the male input jack came off due to heat. the heat melted the soldering off.2) on the second pack i purchased a transistor burned out.3) now ive noticed that the plastic coating on the wires are beginning to disconnect from the pack.This is the 2nd battery pack that i've purchased from this company(3rd that i've owned, they sent me a new one after i emailed them about the deffect). i've had to replace all of them. it is most unfortunate, but i will no longer be purchasing items from this company."
3,"Not quite what I expected, but good.","I think that this would be an excellent book for someone who already follows the faerie faith, and an ok book for someone who is just generally interested in the topic. I thought that this would be more of a general overview of faery folklore and such. I wasn't really expecting the other spiritual parts. Just be aware that this book is geared towards a certain belief system, and is not just a generic book of ""lore""."
3,Informative!,I was hoping for more illustrations but on the whole it is very informative and interesting. A fun read!!
5,great soul food,I love this book it has so many helpful and simple recipes. I am semi vegetarian and trying to become vegetarian (maybe vegan) this book makes it easy. I mean this stuff taste really good. I love it and my family does too... I searched for her on the web hoping for more brilliant and delicious recipes since the book was written over 20 uears ago.
2,Sent it back,"These watches from Suunto have the worst manuals I have ever seen. Combine that with five buttons and lots of functions and you get a very frustrating product. Mine didn't synch up with the heart strap and I couldn't figure the thing out so I returned it and bought a T4c which was still maddening, but it works, and now that I have figured out how to do what I want, I love it."
3,It's cheap,"I bought two of these for a road trip and unfortunately one broke on the first day when my dog barely touched it, leaving the tip of the cable stuck in the AUX port in my car. The other one, and my cable that only routes sound to one speaker, still works. When it does work, it works pretty well though."
4,ADEQUATE CABLE FOR THE JOB,"This is an inexpensive 25 foot computer audio cable that does the job. There are better cables out there, for not much more money. This one should work just fine for most applications. It should fit most computer input/output jacks without a problem. Quick shipping."
1,Just awful,"I have a fairly decent computer (which exceeds the system requirements), have almost all graphical options turned off and the frame rates are still horrible. The menu system is much worse than NWN. I played it for about an hour and was just so disgusted with the control and the frame rates that I quit playing. I downloaded the patch and it didn't help performance at all."
2,"OK, but just OK","My two biggest complaints are system requirements and interface, and believe me those are pretty big areas to have complaints in.System requirements...I really don't see what the extra graphics horsepower bought us. OK the eye candy is a bit ""tastier"" but did it enhance gameplay. I would say no. It seems that you paid for hardware upgrades to basically bring your system up to ""state-of-the-art"" and the graphics in the game aren't ""breakthrough"" enough, but it just might be that I over-expected.Now the game mechanics or interface, that's a whole other story. Horrid simply horrid. While the radial interface of the original game was a little cumbersome, there was at least some intuitive-ness to it. From the click on the map to go there traveling, to hard to get rid of quests, this new game is just wrong. As you progress in gameplay, the interface gets easier, but it's never a smooth organic feel."
3,"Not an improvement over NWN, not as fun as BG","I feel like this game reached its height of fun with Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2. Since then its gone down hill. At least you can play with more chars in your group in NWN2 and have more control over them than NWN. However, even though NWN2 has taken some power away from the fighter types compared to NWN (no more devastating critical), it still seems like magic is MUCH less important in these games than in BG. Also, to me a lot of the fun comes from controlling the leveling of several different kinds of characters, but there are many limits on this in NWN2 (limited number of custom characters, few choices on classes to level chars to, etc.). If you haven't played BG, get that at a bargain price instead."
1,Big disapointment,"First of all, they lost the Linux run-time. This was a huge benefit for a large number of people, and once you got SDL configured, it ran great.I never got it running with WINE or Cedega.Game play on WindowsXP was pretty lame. Harder to use than NWN, and less dimensionality.Get it right guys! There is no reason to have a lame title based on AD&D; rules, esp. once you have the engine. Just add content. How hard can this be?"
3,"It's fun, but buggy.","I love this game. The characters and gameplay are great. However, bugs are a problem. Most, if you've kept a couple saves, can be backed up to avoid, but I think I'm in a place now where I may not be able to finish the game because it crashes every time I try to go back to the courtyard of my castle. Big problem."
3,NWN2 Disappointing,"NWN2 is just an extension of NWN1 with upgraded graphics, The voice files for your characters are the exact same ones they had in the original with nothing new. Most of the music has not even been changed. For some reason I did expect more, but I am ok with the game simply because of the roleplay potential. The big negative is with the DM client, it did not work at all when it was released, and it was an absolute disappointment for people who run Persistant world servers.I think the main object of NWN2 was to create an improved platform over NWN1 where people can specifically create their own persistnat worlds and run with them. They have done that, but it started with a broken DM client which got the game is off to a slow start.I still think it will be a good game to play for a while. I must admit though, I am finding myself not playing NWN2 as much as I thought I would. I am already bored with it to a certain degree."
1,sucks,"The game itself looks awsome from the previews I have seen and I have played the prior released games. But this game is so NOT compatible with my new computer that I would have to pay $[...] more to upgrade a new computer to be able to play. That was a big disappointment itself. Why would anyone make a game that is so uncompatible with computers. It would download, but I could not play the game at all."
1,"If Unsure of Specs, Don't Buy It","I have a custom built PC and have waited for 6 years to play this game. I got it for Christmas, thankfully off this webpage so I saved about 30 bucks, but was unsure of my PC specs- I have better specs than on the box's requirements, certainly, but the game still wouldn't work and the buyer I got it from had the nerve to tell me I couldn't refund it. Keep in mind this thing's built like a tank and my PC couldn't play it- and so I lost a chunk of money on the damn game.I'm sure it's a good game, but look over your PC's specs and the minimum requirements here and wait until computer parts get a LOT cheaper before you bother upgrading your computer."
4,The Harder They Fall,"Evan Henderson is the embodiment of all Lissa James has come to despise. Because of her past run-in with the law, she is wary of the the charming assistant D.A. and attempts to put him at a distance as she does with all his kind.Lissa James is a puzzle that Evan is eager to solve and put aside. The problem for him is that he is unable to resist the challenge she presents. His fascination for her develops into first a wary friendship and eventually a strong commitment.I really enjoyed the latest installment of Lovelace's Bar-H series because Evan was appealing as a hero and Lissa, with her troublesome yet generous heart, is impossible to not admire given all the heartache she has endured.I, too, found the resolution concerning her family ties to be too easy. Being accustomed to some form of sinister threat in the Bar-H books, I found the development of the plot to be something of a surprise.After enjoying Evan and Lissa's story, I am looking forward to Jake's."
4,Good... but TINY!!,"The book is the classic poem, and the illustrations are nice (many are sketches, but with a few full-color pictures of Jolly Old St. Nick.) My biggest concern was when I opened the box... all I saw at first was a big piece of crumpled packing paper... and when I removed that... there was this LITTLE TINY book in the box! It was my own fault for not reading every detail on this page, I guess, but this was to be the classic to read our kids every Christmas Eve, and it's a nice quality, just hard for the kids to see! Just be aware before you purchase... Product Dimensions: 3.3 x 2.8 x 0.6 inches."
1,WARNING!!!!!! THIS BOOK IS ONLY 2 1/2 x 3 INCH BOOK!,"When I paid $4.95 for a Hardcover book I expected a full size children's book, not a 2 1/2 X 3 minature book. Nowhere in the description does it state the size of this HARDCOVER BOOK. ****TIP READ REVIEWS BEFORE PURCHASING**** MY MISTAKE!"
1,Was very disappointed and will return for refund,"I bought this book for a friend to read to their grandchildren and also bought one for myself so imagine my surprise when I opened the box and it barely fit in the palm of my hand. I feel that this book is a consumer rip off and that amazon should offer free return shipping. I know I should have checked the reviews before I purchased, but have never had a problem like this with anything I have ordered before. I hope no one else has this problem and feel that it should be taken off the site because this is a joke to expect people to read this to children. Not a picture at all. Holidays are a rush for us all and to have to check all the details before purchasing. Sigh!!! Not a good experience."
1,"""No Show""","I Ordered "" The Night Before Christmas: The Classic Edition by Clement C. Moore. I wanted the book as a gift for my little grandson. I was told that I would receive the book by December 28,2004,(not December 28,2005) I am still waiting for my book. It is now January 08,2005. I am very dissappointed, and feel like the seller ""just blew me off"" In my book this is no way to do business, and it's seller like this that give a bad name to the internet.S.A.M"
3,average,"(I listened to samples of the songs on another site because the samples do not work on amazon.com, but did work on allmusic.com.)Song 7 (Sandman) IS NOT a foxtrot. It is a quickstep. The other foxtrot songs are about the correct tempo, but I did not like them much, all of them sound too mellow.The character of the foxtrot is captured by a very gentleman/gentlewoman attitude so it can be more serious than say a quickstep or Viennese/Slow Waltz, but it does not have to be all sad..."
4,nice little camera,"Very nice camera well built and extensive set of features too. I did not expect the live view feature to be so handy and useful. It is very easy to use, with all switches in the right places.the E410 is for armature and pro alike so its excellent entry level DSLR. With Panasonic and lieca adopting their four third system, the future is bright.Drawback of that system Chinese made and the AF only three (comparing to 9 in canon 400D)If you can pay little extra, go for the E510 its even better"
3,Required Text,Haven't used it yet but presume that it will be a handy little resource to have when I need it. I'm a wordaholic and now I have to be an APA (American Psychological Association) FREAK about format. I'm sure it will be useful.
1,Total Incompetence,"The day after the order was placed I received an E-mail advising I would receive the material between June 16 and June 20. Not having received anything, on June 22, I called and was told the material would be sent to me. It never was. Finally, I had to cancel the order. Clearly, these people do not have a clue what they are doing. Too bad you don't have 0 stars or even minus stars."
2,Do you really need this?,"If I had bought something with moving parts, this would have been good to get. I was worried I'd get a lemon and then need this. I was foolish and naive. After my TV arrived, I thought I made a bad move! I thought afterwards, if it broke, I would have been covered by AMAZON or even the maker, for a YEAR!But oh well, you live, you learn and hopefully don't make the same mistake again!"
1,under cabinet tv,Received TV and installed. Very bad picture. Not acceptable. Defective.Returned and still do not have replacement. Maybe I should get a refund and buy from a reputable supplier.Ron
1,Beware!!!,"I, like the other reviewer, purchased this book under the impression that I was buying a new release from this author. When I started reading this book I noticed it was the same as Ida B. Now, on the front of this book it does state in small print ""previously released as Ida B"". However, I would have never expected this nor would I have thought that an author would go through such extremes to make money. Very shady lady. I will not buy any more of her novels for fear that I will get burned again. I will try to send this one of the books back to amazon."
3,Old Book With New Cover,"I don't know if the publishers or the author is trying to pull one over on the readers or what but I bought this book thinking it was something new and it is the same book called Ida B. that I already bought. It was no different on the inside, kinda weak writing like a teenager wrote it and a little bit hard to believe although I love those projects she mentions and liked her first book."
5,VERY GOOD BOOK,"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK, ESPECIALLY SINCE I USED TO LIVE IN A HOUSING PROJECT THAT WAS KINDA LIKE THE ONE IN THE BOOK.THE AUTHOR MADE THE BOOK VERY REALISTIC, AND I THOUGHT ALL THE CHARACTERS SEEMED VERY TRUE TO LIFE. ESPECIALLY AUNT PAT.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS BOOK VERY HIGHLY."
4,Great Watch,"I was searching for a watch that I could wear to work and on the weekends running around with the family. This Citizen watch was the exactly look I wanted. It is feminine, but too girly. It is very lightweight and looks great. It is only slightly water-proof. According to the manual, it is OK if you are washing your hands and some water is splashed on it, but don't submerge it in water. I am not an avid diver or anything, but it would be nice to know I could jump in a pool without ruining my watch. I love the fact that I don't have to buy batteries."
4,This story moves you to go on,Confessions of a Battered Woman gives a true heart felt delivery to the reader. I really enjoyed reading the book and discovering a life that showed a true survivor and heroine. Emily painted a vivid picture of what life was like for her during these hard times. More importantly she offers resources and hope for women who are currently living silent/secret lives of shame and uncertainty.
2,Fine for a previous decade,"The material was dated, in terms of technical aspects. Explanations of the process of film making did nothing to fulfill the title - How to Read a Film. With that title I expected the focus to be on the creation, development and presentation of film content, film theory and the phenomenon of communication through the medium of cinema. Perhaps when it was first released it was more relevant to the reading audience. If you already have a basic understanding of the cinema arts or film history, you may find the book does not add a lot of new insights or information."
2,needed advice,they were very cute but in making them the arms kept breaking on the monkeys when we tried to take them from the molds.
2,Difficult to work with.,"I needed a monkey candy mold for a cake I was doing. This were difficult to work with because it was hard to get the melted chocolate to flow to the extended arms on the mold. Even if I did get them filled properly, about a third of the completed monkeys had the arms break off. I wouldn't recommend these."
5,Great for Novices,"I'm just starting out in Real Estate Investing, and this is the first book I've read on the topic. The book explains the 5 ""paths"" in a way that, as a beginner, I can still understand, yet its far from being simplistic.I was expecting this book to be just a basic ""overview"" of Real Estate investing, but the author gives you a lot more inforation than just the basics."
5,Fantastic acoustic guitar work,"This is one of those hidden treasures I found with the help of Pandora. I'm a big fan of slack key and bluegrass- lots of ""acousticness"" in my taste.So this is a truly wonderful CD for fans of acoustic music. There are a number of original songs and a fantastic version of Pacabel's Canon in D. Trace is a virtuoso with all the tricks, finger picking and lots of percussive stuff. The sound quality is great- it sounds like it was recorded 12 inches from the sound hole. You are right there. With high quality earbuds, it is a wonderful performance to experience."
3,Poor packaging,Good book but packaged poorly and received damage in transit. Did receive my package when they said I would but I would have preferred to receive it undamaged.
1,Not Helpful,"I struggled through reading this text, and in the end was rewarded with a C in the class. There may be a book that has fewer resources to help students succeed, but I don't know or want to know what that book is."
3,its good but not enough,"this is undoubtly an intresting book,but its main problem is the weaknesses in growth theory.furthermore,i believe it should be improoved in its explanations and the depth of the knowledge it provides.concluding,it is an excellent book for a begginer level,but not an intermidiate one"
5,good deal,"Had no issues with the installation of this cable, plenty of length and power cord was long enough to move about and hide. Only drawback (but not a deal breaker) is the actual color of the glow wire is more along the lines of a very light red color (not quite pink, but not a red as in the LED red fans you can get), however, not with standing that, it is a nice addition to my case and I do like it. Just dont expect it to be a true red! Cheers!"
4,Good Overview for the new archer whether target or hunting.,"As a new entrant to the sport, I found the book to give a comprehensive overview of several aspects of the sport, though it tends to focus more on hunting as opposed to target. It discusses available equipment, (bows, arrows, accessories) as well as some instructions on how to make your own. I'm not ready to cut down a tree and make a bow, but the articles did give me some insight.It was very helpful for me."
5,christmas present,bought this product for my daughter as a christmas present as it was rated as high on her wish list. she and her friends enjoyed watching this anime.
1,Not So Stylish!,Betty Spaghetty is such a cute doll (my favorite set is the Betty's Closet series) why do all of the books about her have to be so nerdy?
3,does the job,Does the job. Wish there were options made out of better materials (ceramic? metal? wood?) to replace missing towel bars in old homes.
4,A fine replacement bar,"We just installed this replacement bar in place of an old wood bar that had mildewed. It took under 10 minutes to install and seems to work well. The one trick is trying to get the exact measurement when you need to insert the one bar end into a recessed bracket. I had to bend the bar pretty substantially to get it in, but I probably should have cut it a bit shorter. As for looks, well, it looks like a plastic towel bar, but there are not that many other options out there for replacing old wood towel bars with fixed brackets."
1,Dachshund for Dummies,"I just recently had a medical emergency with my Dachshund. She woke up and I noticed that she was dragging her back leg, I knew immediately what was wrong and took her to the vet within an hour of noticing it. Within 8 hours she could not stand on either leg and I had to rush her to a big Vet Hospital, they did surgery on her that same night. Back problems in dachshunds are common and if I had not read a lot of books on the subject I would not have know. I found this book very well written and very informative, the way they explained everything about their backs in depth. I would recommend this book very highly and plan on purchasing it for all the people who purchased her puppies, a MUST FOR ANY DACHSHUND OWNER.Linda Goodwin"
1,Better Books Out There,"I was disappointed in this book. It barely touched on some important topics. I would strongly suggest buying ""Dachshunds for Dummies"" instead."
3,Bird / Squirrel feeder,"It's a good feeder in that the feeding tube is mesh, which allows the bird seed to stay fresh and dry - as opposed to a solid tube with feeding stations that allows moisture to enter, but not dry once inside, causing mold and contamination of bird seed. It is also very easy to fill. And you can't beat the price.The semi bad thing is that the cage surround has openings large enough to allow squirrels to feed from it. It basically became 'the squirrel feeder'. If hung in a place inaccessible to squirrels, it's a perfect bird feeder."
3,hard to fasten,"These are very nice Bali-style and a good size. They are very hard to fasten, though, hope if you get them you have a lot of patience or a good friend that will help put them on you !! Carol"
3,Not Secure,"I love the look and size of these earrings but could not fasten them because the way the wire is to go in the earlobe, it was wobbly and I could not close them to secure them."
2,Need a PhD to put this together,This was extremely difficult to put together. The pieces did not fit together right. It states to use the sandpaper to fix the pieces that dont fit together. We couldnt find the sandpaper they were referring to. After we cleaned up we found it. Its a one inch square of sandpaper. Wow could they be any cheaper on the materials.
5,VERY WELL PUT...,"Simply Marvelous! DIARY OF AN IMOTIONAL IDIOT, is like a party in my psyche. I'm waitingopen-eyed (and open mouthed) for the next guest..."
4,An author coming into her own as a writer,"Maggie Estep, who I have been a fan of for years since her MTV days, has written a funny and quirky coming-of-age novel that I must highly recommend. What is most striking about this novel is not its plot or character development, but Estep's voice, one of the most distinctive today. The over-the-top situations and wildly funny antics of the heroine, written in Estep's trademark deadpan language, are the strength of the ""Diary."" The novel is written like one of her CD tirades, and we can imagine her loudmouth voice reading the lines to us. The novel is also semi-autobiographical, so it's easy to imagine Estep's distinct personality throughout the book. Often hilarious, Estep's first novel signals the coming of age of not only Zoe, but also of Estep, who seems poised to be a fine novelist. Looking forward to ""Soft Maniacs."""
3,diary of an emotional idiot,"Not quite an addiction novel, not quite a sex book, and not quite a serious addition to the canons of ""serious"" literature, this is a winning novel. It replaces the graphic realism of many like-mended books with cynicism, sarcasm, and (gasp!) humor. Parts of this book are flat out hilarious. Autobiography blurs into stand-up comedy as our intrepid heroin documents her journey into the weird. From a lit crit point of view, I wanted to hate this book, and tear it apart for the latitude the editors gave her because she is who she is. I wanted to savage it because of parts of it could have been written by a precocious junior high student. In the end, though, I have to admit, it did win me over. Against all better judgement I would recommend this book. Just don't expect William Burroughs."
5,I had Maggies poetry on my fridge for years,"Maggie--if she dosn't burn out--, can be as great a writer as the past several decades have seen. I am admittedly of the 60's, Maggie. where the hell were you then ? I think she;Loved me like blossoming flowersBursting out with the zany needsOf petal attractionOnly to wilt, fall, and rot,Rootstock suckling once againThe dirt of her existenceTill the next time.Uhmmm---Maggie--Whadda gal."
1,Kind of flabbergasted at all the praise...,"This is just a really awful book. I know a lot of people assume that anyone who doesn't like Maggie Estep doesn't get punk rock or transgressive/alternative fiction or like hanging out on the lower east side...Au contraire, though I rarely wear my Gen-X hipster chevrons on my sleeve, this should be right up my alley. But it's awful.Like you would expect from Estep, it has some verve and is definitely different, but it's a rambling mess. I suppose the confessional aspect is supposed to be endearing, but I was just generally offput by the decisions Estep's narrator makes. It's hard to muster sympathy for Zoe.Judgment, on the other hand, comes quite naturally. The narrator is supposed to be an ""emotional"" idiot -- but I'd just do away with the qualifier. And I'd skip this book while we're at it."
4,Good basic book.,This book is a nice basic guide to figuring out symptoms with your dog. Easy to find symptoms & to understand. A good book to have in your addition along with other dog books one may have.
3,Perhaps for the beginner dog owner.,"I had high hopes for this book, however, the flow charts often end in ""call your veterinarian"". Even in cases when home remedies are available, it often suggests you call your vet for a home remedy! Calling my vet is what I was trying to avoid (hmmm...I guess I should have expected this, since it is a ""veterinarian's guide"")! I would leave this one for beginner-level dog owners."
3,"Simple, helpful","This book was easy to read and go through; but I was done with it in one afternoon. I was looking to be educated about our new adult dog, and I didn't find plenty of content that did it. Most of what was there I already knew. Possibly useful for someone with no knowledge if dogs; but if you've already done a little research, you'll need to step it up a notch."
4,Beautiful!,"This was purchased to add the collection of Holiday Barbies we already have. She is beautiful and well presented, great attention to detail... one of the nicest ones presented yet! I actually prefer this one to the current year."
1,BORE ME SOMEMORE,BOUGHT HER ONLY FOR THE COLLECTION. BORING. WOULDN'T BUY IT IT. NO FAKE FUR! TELL ME WHEN THEIR ALL STARTING TO LOOK THE SAME TO YOU??
4,Beautiful doll,It was a good price for a beautiful doll. It seems to be well made and has been played with by my daughter.
1,Badly thought out toy,"At first this product seems pretty good. A shape sorter should be educational and fun for very young children. The rainmaker seems like a nice feature until you get it home. It's tricky for even an adult to put the shapes into the sorter as they only just about fit into the holes. Once in, they make the most annoying noise whilst sliding down the tubes. The pleasant and soft sound of the rainmaker is completely destroyed by the banging of the plastic colored shapes on the sides.I'm sad to say that my eight months old played with this for five minutes and now shows no interest in it. If you're looking for a shape sorter, please buy a traditional one and not this disappointing product."
3,Dark Ride (r4 title),"This is about a a young man who works for his uncle's courier service and unexpectedly picks up a female passenger who is running from the police. He ends up getting involved with her and finding out she is a hit-man/killer wanted for multiple murders who winds up letting him take the blame for the assassinations going on of witnesses to something she has been hired to take out.He end's up being a fugitive and getting friends involved to help aid his escapes and help capture the real killer wanted.Overall, it's not a bad movie. There are some things that puzzled me about why it was supposed to be in Germany when everyone has American or British accents, but I may have misinterpreted something in the movie.There is plenty of car chase action not done in CGI that was pretty impressive for what looked to be not a low budget picture, but not a very high one either.It was a pretty fun little movie that I think deserves a rental if these sort of movies take your interest."
1,Disappointment Too,"1) The system caused the rear speakers to emit an annoying hum as soon as they were turned on - this matches the report from the other reviewer, so maybe that's just how they're made. I had the SH-FX60 connected to a Panasonic SC-HT40. The rear speakers are just fine with no hum or static when connected directly.2) Within the first 5 minutes of operation, there was a small ""pop!"" and the rear speakers ceased to emit any sound except the hum described above. The green circle that is supposed to light up showing the receiver sees a signal also went out. Installation had been done according to the instructions. I power-cycled both the surround system and the receiver, tried taking the transmitter out and putting it back in when the surround system was off, and the rear speakers never came back on; neither did the green circle.I ended up returning the product."
1,Don't recommend if you have other wireless gadgets,"I tried to use the SH-FX60 kit with my Panasonic SC-HT740 system, but it only worked within 5 feet of the transmitter! Past that range, the wireless connection could not be made and no sound at all came through to the rear surround speakers -- possibly due to interference from other wireless gadgets. If you have other wireless devices that you aren't ready to part with, or if you're in a building where others may have wireless gadgets in close range, do not waste your money on this item. Otherwise, cross your fingers and maybe it'll just work."
1,FX60 - Disappointment,"There is an annoying buzz in the sound system while using the FX60. Removing the white transmitter card from the home theater box is the only way to get rid of the buzz; of course this disables the FX60.If this is typical for other users, then the FX60 may not be a good investment. I don't recommend it."
2,Maybe OK for a Smaller Room,I found this unit to be unacceptable for my (large) living room. It failed at about 20 feet or so and I had to return it. Panasonic claims 33 feet range.
4,Panasonic SH-FX60 Rear Wireless Upgrade Kit,"This product works great, good sound, and easily hidden. The only draw back is that the back speakers still have to be connected together by wires. I expected them to be independent not wired together, probably should of read the fine print if there was any. Good product hovever for the low price!!!"
1,Why did I buy this...,"I've been thoroughly disappointed with this system since the day I purchased it. First off, I can hardly hear anything from the speakers (no individual volume control for the wireless speakers). I have to put my ears up against the speakers to actually hear them (I think this may not be due to the wireless speakers so much as the Panasonic system driving them).That's not the most annoying feature though. Ever since I installed the wireless kit, I've had problems with my wireless home network. Apparently, this Kit interferes with my wireless g network. At one point I could not get my network to work at all. Sometimes, I cannot even use my network while I've got my TV/surround on. So I have to turn it off just to work on my computer. Ridiculous."
4,Yikes! Where's My---,"Arthur rolls on, this time--it appears--pant-less.Arthur remains, deservedly so, a hit with kids. All of the Arthur books are worth owning, because they're fun for kids and parents will not be dulled to sleep when they read them."
1,terrible artwork,"very disappointed in this book. The art work is hideous. The cover shows a modern looking Arthur, but the illustrations show Arthur and his family looking more like rats than bears. My kid didn't even recognize Arthur. He kept saying ""That's not Arthur"".If they redid the illustrations inside the book (as they did the cover), I would give it a much better rating. But the story is very mediocre, and the horrid artwork has made me regret purchasing this."
4,Fabulous Marc Brown as usual,"Love the Arthur stories! Marc Brown's books always teach a lesson, and this one is no exception. It allows children to feel embarassed at times, and doesn't sugar coat how other children will probably react to someone else's embarassment.Arthur stories are illustrated in a couple of different ways. One way the characters are like they are in the television shows, and the other way they are done by an illustrator. The cartoon characters are much more appealing to children than the illustrated versions, which make the characters look downright mean!"
5,aurthur book,"Good easy read. OUr daughter wanted this. She loves to read. If you love Aurthur books, you will love this one too."
3,Works!,"I bought this really not looking any where else. I love amazon so much that is what I usually do, but in this case I wish I would have look at others. Lowes sells this stamp for only $10. I wished the pattern was a little more define, such as there were more heights in certain area. My father in-law asked me when I was going to stamp it after I had already stamped it. I could tell I stamped it, but he really had to look at it."
2,disappointed,I have loved all the other WW cookooks I've purchased. This one doesn't have a lot that I'm interested in making because of the higher points.
4,Sugar,"I bought this for rimming my lemon drops and everyone seemed very happy with the flavor, I used lemon juice of course to help it stick."
2,Not as advertised and damaged on receipt,"I just received this table top and discovered that it is set up for black jack on one side even though it states it is plain on both sides. Real problem is that the plastic chip/drink holders can only be used on the black jack side because the plain side has no cut outs for the trays to fit into. However, if you want to turn it over you still have to remove the trays because you can't have the plastic scraping on your table top. Not functional and not as advertised.And the top was damaged out of the box. The particle board is buckled at the edge where the top folds and a 2 foot section of the edge has the felt worn off so that it is thread bare down to the white.I am writing Poker Bargains to return the top and get a new one."
1,Styrofoam,"I believe everyone is getting different tables according to the reviews. Mine is not strong and not wood like others, it feels like styrofoam under the felt (very cheap). The bottle/can/glass holders are not deep enough to hold anything, you can't turn it over to reverse the cup/chip holder and the underside has nothing but cheap vinyl....no wording, no felt. Seriously, this is not a good table top poker table at all. I keep reading how sturdy some table tops are.....what?? it's styrofoam.....how sturdy can styrofoam be? The box was barely taped closed when I got it. No packing. Come on Amazon..make sure your distributors are sending the same item to everyone. What good is a review if the items are not even similar. What a waste of time and don't even get me started on time......it could have been here a week earlier had the estimate shipping time been correct....COME ON !!!!!!"
4,good buy,"Product is sturdy, felt is good quality. Plastic inserts adequate for product. Nice carrying case. Product arrived quickly and was exactly what I expected. I ordered another ""amazon.com"" product at the same time, which supposedly shipped out sooner, but according to the tracking it is not scheduled to arrive for several more days. This company has a very good turn around time it seems."
5,Play cards!,It's perfect for where I wanted it. The quality is also very nice. Should last a long time.
3,Seems about right for the price,"I ordered this through Brybelly and it was shipped to me in a cardboard box without any padding. Unfortunately, at some point in the shipping something apparently jabbed into it throught the cardboard and ripped the carrying bag. Also, somehow in the shipping some of the plastic on the chip holder shattered. I contacted Brybelly and they e-mailed me right back asking me if I wanted to return or exchange. I've just been too lazy to send it back. The overall quality of it is about right for the price."
3,Eh,"The case has spots all over it, like oil stains. It folds into two, instead of four, so storage isn't as easy as it could be. I also do not like how ""raised"" the words printed on the top are. They should be smooth & flat. Not thrilled with this product."
5,Huge table. good for 8 people,positive things:- its cheap- very flat and nicely shaped- every player has a cupholder and chip holder- Great value for money- te table is pretty solid. and quite rigidnegative things (very trivial)- heavy (bcoz it is huge)- cupholder in between the chipholder which is weird.- the engraving on the table doesnt let u deal the cards properly(basically slide the cards)- the cupholders come out while folding the table.
1,Broken,I ordered one and had it arrive broken. I notified the company and had another one sent and had it to also arrive broken. I wouldn't order one from this company.
4,home games,this is a very good table for anybody that plays a lot of home texas holdem poker. reasonaly priced aswell.
1,ripped off!,"i purchased this table from brybelly and it showed up labeled fragile, there was no foam in the package to keep it from being damaged during transport. well it was ruined when it showed up. i contacted brybelly and they told me to bad they would do nothing. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER, THEY WILL RIPP YOU OFF!"
2,ok if you need two sides,"I purchased this for Christmas and returned it. The felt was coming up a bit. When I tried to reverse the chip/cup holder, it was really hard to get into the other side. It was a nice, thick table, but didn't seem very well made. I only needed one side, we don't play much blackjack, so I returned it and got the Da Vinci table top and am very happy with it."
1,Terrible company this item was not as described it is a blackjack table not poker,This item is not a poker table it is a blackjack table and I did not know this until I opened the item. On the back is a blank side and they claim that is the poker side but it is not set up like a poker and the trays to not fit when you turn it over and it looks super cheap.The return policy is that they will only accept item that has never been open however how would I know this item was not as described until I open it.It was a waste of money never again will I buy item like this online
3,More of what one expects,"Wings of Omen, the sixth in the Thieves' World series, brings more of what one expects from the series. Featuring 8 stories from talented authors (including Asprin, Lynn Abbey, Diana Paxson, and C.J. Cherryh), Wings moves the town of Sanctuary into an open guerilla conflict on the street. Like the other Thieves' World books, the format of different stories occurring in the same location has strengths and weaknesses. On the one hand, it is intersting to see the different perspectives each writer brings. On the other hand, interesting ideas generated by one writer or poorly followed up, or not at all. Too, there have been so many authors writing about so many characters that a glossary has become a must to keep track of who is whom. Nevertheless, Wings of Omen is an enjoyable, if somewhat dark and depressing at times, read."
5,Um livro completo,"O livro perfeito para quem quer aprender e também para quem já faz marmorizao em papeis e/ou tecidos. Com dicas das bases, tintas, como fazer seus materiais além de instrues dos mais variados tipos de marmorizao. Estou felicíssima com minha compra. Os correios brasileiros também esto melhores... rs... Fiz meu pedido dia 16 de outubro e recebi dia 05 de novembro."
1,Not as described,I was very disappointed with this book. The description wasn't thorough and it is nothing at all as I expected. I will return it. If you're looking for a way to record family history and ancestry this isn't the book for you.
4,Might have been called The Definitive Guide to RSS,"One of the very best O'Reilly books I've read in a long time, is Developing Feeds with RSS and Atom by Ben Hammersley. On 240 odd pages, the author introduces the reader to syndication, feeds, the RSS dialects, the Atom syndication format and discusses parsing of feeds and creating feeds. This he does concisely and to the point but with a sense of humor which I greatly enjoy.The only thing which might be expanded on in a second edition, would be how different RSS reader applications react to feed content. Never the less, I highly recommend this book to anybody wanting to get inside RSS feeds."
3,Stiletto Home Dock not enough for the price.,I just bought a Stiletto 100 with a Home Dock Kit costing all in all $415. The Home dock of course it absolutly required and I have to say I`m not terribly impressed with it. The biggest problem is the FM Transmitter on the Home Dock is terrible. The maximum range I can get out of it is about 15-20 feet before the signal to the radio I used in my bedroom completely breaks down into static. When I first baught Sirius and I bought one of the Xact radios for $80 at target and the FM transmitter would broadcast throughout the house. The only way to rectify this is to either buy multiple Home Docks at $70 each and have one in practically every room in the house plus one in the backyard. Or everytime I want to listen to the sirius radio migrate the setup from room to room. Not exactly worth price in my book.
4,Tae Bo Advanced,I love this product. It almost an hour of kicking/punching. If you love other Tae Bo programs then you should love this one too!
1,Bad choice,"If you really need headphones, those Maxell are not what you want.First, they only look nice in the picture, yet when u get them, u dont know what you purchased: a sattelite dish? frying pans? what? Certainly not headphones. They are heavy, they don't fit the ears at all, and the worst thing: they squeeze on your ears as if you are being tortured. You really get a headache after you use them. Their sound is so so, you don't expect great sound when you purchase 10 or 30 or 50$ headphones.The only nice thing about them is the way they fold. Other than that, they are not a good choice, I bought JVC last year from amazon for 5$, they were much much much better. Yes 5$."
1,Horrible,"The headphones were damaged already,the area to adjust the bigness was not working. It jus stayed to big for my ears. They were NOT the color I ordered! I ordered gold,and got silver! They are just all messed up an wuld like a return if possible?"
1,Not worth it,"I just bought these headphones for my son to use with his computer. I'm glad I took them out of the box first and tried them out. There's no sound in one ear, and they haven't even been used yet! Not a good sign. After looking at others reviews, it's obvious that they are poorly made and if they hadn't been broken already, they would be soon. I'll be returning them to the store and getting a different product."
3,Nice for Occasional Use,"I bought a pair of these in the cheap electronics aisle in my local CVS Pharmacy. They worked good for a bit but then the wire (the insanely thin one) tore and was dead then and there. Because of the price and the marginally good sound quality I bought a new pair and am fairly happy with them so far.These headphones aren't any studio monitors but they're good for the price and at 32ohms and 100mw with the 40mm drivers, they aren't too wimpy. They are very flimsy at the connection to the cone arch to the headband and I had to take them apart and put electrical tape around the headband wire at the bottom to make it so they don't jiggle around. I found the volume adjuster annoying, I mean, what are you going to be using them with that you'd need that?For the price and sound they're an okay buy. But don't be too rough and ignore the reviewer below me's advice to get Sony's, if you want better phones, get some AKG's or some Sennheisers."
2,Comfortable but fall apart,"I found these to be fairly comfortable, and the volume control is convenient, but I ended up going through three pairs.On the first pair, one of the wires eventually disconnected inside the earpiece, leaving it with sound in only one earpiece. The second and third pairs (which I purchased at the same time with the idea of having one for the computer and one to carry around) didn't last as long (perhaps a few months each). In both of them, the insulation around one of the wires had (or developed? I'm not sure how this happened) a cut in it, and the insulation eventually separated from itself, exposing the wire. The wire then eventually frayed away, again leaving the headphones with sound in only one earpiece. Also on the third one, one of the pieces attaching the earpiece to the headband broke (before the wire frayed), but I was able to swap it out with the same piece from the second pair."
4,This is early 90's rap...,This is the best 90's hip-hop compilation out there and it has a good mix of slammin' tracks from the nicest MC's. I recommend you buying Part 2. and Part 3. after you buy this. PEACE!
3,"Not a bad game, be careful how you buy it","This is not really intended as a review; rather, it is intended as a warning to potential buyers.Be vary cautious about buying this game without the manual; this game employs the old-style copy protection system wherein you have to type in a word from a certain page of the manual to even play."
5,beautiful animals,"this is a beautifully produced dvd of my favorite species of the ape family, a pleasure to watch in there natural state, so seemingly friendly, just watching the young ones makes you wish you could adopt one or two. its so sad to see the deforestation occurring at the alarming rate at the moment, man needs to take a good look at the destruction they are causing to all our animal kingdom, we shall destroy everything and then feel so sorry. i feel sorry for the grandchildren we bring into this world for were leaving nothing for them, i love all animals and view this one as a five star rating,well done."
5,I saw myself in this book,"Before I read this book I was having so many difficulties in my life with money, family, friends and relationships. The author of this book made me feel that the book was written just for me. So many of the things that she discuses in her chapters have applied to my life and I would like to thank her for being such a great help in restoring my faith in the universe. Her positive attitude has also taught me that God is the server and I can manifest anything that I want in my life. It really does work like she says I am now living the life I've always wanted."
4,Beware of your color selection,"I purchased this product from a different website as a gift for someone and ended up returning the sweater because of the color. The ""squid ink"" color looks like a nice blue in every picture I've seen of the item but in reality it's a very bright purple. Like Grimace purple.Several people actually burst out laughing when I showed it to them, and I kinda had to laugh myself. I'm guessing that's why the squid ink color is discounted everywhere."
5,Amazing account of life in the Soviet Union,"This is a wonderful novel about life in the Soviet Union. The destinies and stories of several families are narrated, from the battle of Stalingrad, life in the Gulag, the holocaust, and many many others. Once started, one cannot stop reading it...Highly recommended"
4,A better than you'd expect soviet era novel,With the exception of Bulgakov I don't care much for Soviet literature. I could never finish Dr. Zhivago or Quiet Flows the Don. This book I did enjoy. Particularly the parts that dealt with the jewish physicist (I forgot his name) and his family. The letter he receives from his mother before she's deported is probably the most memorable part of the novel. Some people compare it to War and Peace. I wouldn't go that far but it is good enough that you might want to read it again as I plan to some day.
4,Good but not Tolstoy,The story is really epic and introduces you to a new world. However I felt that some of the characters were more symbols than characters.
1,Boring mediocrity,"Russia defeated the Germans. Their allies played smaller parts in winning the war. But Grossman undermines this truth by filling his tale with propaganda, although he tries to overlay it with some realism about Stalin's rule. The propaganda is specially apparent in certain things Grossman describes the Germans as doing, but the Germans lost the war and the truth is still hidden by the lies that distort the history of any defeated nation.Grossman gives far too much space to ideology. Also, he could have given some credit to Russian spies instead of inflicting the reader with longueurs about German spies.Grossman's characters are shallow except for Grekov, who only makes a fleeting appearance. Maybe Grekov's name is due to the Greeks, the original democrats.In trying to give Grossman the benefit of the doubt, I forced myself to read the whole book. It wasn't worth it. To be fair, though, Grossman's book is less propagandistic than a speech by Ben Bernanke."
5,Will Stand the Test of Time,"My three children are adoped from Russia and Ukraine, and my visits to those countries led me to immerse myself in the history and literature of that fascinating part of the world, which has witnessed a disproportionate amount of pain and suffering.I hope my son and two daughters, both of whom are of Jewish descent, will one day want to know more about their native land, and I hope they will have the profound experience of reading this shocking, yet beautifully written book. It is historical fiction at its finest, and easily the most emotionallly powerful book I've ever read. But brace yourself. I believe it takes courage on behalf of the reader to absorb these pages. I actually had a physical reaction to some of the sentences in Life and Fate and am haunted by them months after finishing.It is simply beyond my ability to describe the experience of reading this book. Grossman has left the world an extraordinary gift that will undoubtedly stand the test of time."
5,A monumental work of literature,"This book uses the format of Tolstoy's War and Peace and the analogous enemy invasion of Russia and resistance to it, re: Napoleon/Hitler, with a focus on the turning point battle of Stalingrad, along with the personal lives of individuals behind the lines coping with the constraints of Stalinist dictates along with the devastating hardships of war. Written by an outstanding journalist who brought his first hand knowledge to construct this extraordinary fictional landscape with a ""you are there"" credibility. Its emotional impact cannot be overstated, and throughout the story, or stories that comprise the whole, there is a genuine feel for the humanity of its characters and their predicaments comparable to the empathic perspective of Chekhov."
5,a must have for every zarthusti(zoroastrian),"wonderful book. very pictorial. brings a lot of nostalgia to every zarthusti.loved the book. loved everything about the culture.would love to see a bit more about ancient persia and a more wider view of our ancestors.there are several beliefs and the reader should have the option of knowing all the historical theories of ancient persia.nevertheless this is a must for every parsi family.even though it is a bit expensive there is a lot of hard work , research and love in this book.well worth the price .thank you for enlightning us.would love to see what are the true ideas behind the zorasatrian philosophy that conversion is a sin. i mean real evidence.not some interpretation of so called vada dastoor's who bend religion to the extreme that it makes you wonder if we really are the great zorastrian religion we proudly proclaim our self of being."
3,Great leadership book,"Great leadership book - very inspiring and takes one through how to closely develop inherent leadership skills. Also loved ""Running with the Rhinos"" in relation to this as well.Running with the Rhinos: Courageous Leadership for a Complex World"
3,Enjoyable read,"This book was good for me, with my little experience in leadership. He keeps the concepts very easy to understand. He adds tons of examples and real life stories throughout the book. I enjoyed having examples, because it made the concepts he was discussing make more sense. I would recommend this to anyone in early leadership."
5,Becoming an Inspiration,"John C. Maxwell's book, Developing the Leader Within You, will no doubt become a classic. Maxwell's approaches to leadership are easy to understand and put into daily practice. This book is the starting-gate for any person desiring to lead and is also essential for the well-seasoned leader because of the concrete principles.We hear so much about the dog-eat-dog world and it is refreshing to be reminded that we are called to become something greater. This book will alter your mindset, challenge your faith, and prod you to serve others while building a strong team."
5,Developing the Leader Within You,An excellent resource for leaders to determine what's important in leading people. This book covers many of the main issues and points pertinent to leaders. It's difficult to find all the things one needs to consider in one place and done well - this is one of the best ones.
3,Go with paper,"The book is fine, chock full of home anecdotes and pithy quotes. It's a good read, get it.But skip the Kindle version and go with paper.I don't know why but this kindle book is barely readable. The font is broken, underlined words appear next to, not under the words they are to underline. This is the worst kindle conversion I have seen (including some pdf to kindle conversions)."
2,"Good advice, but very preachy and self-indulgent.","Long story short, there are a lot of seemingly useful tidbits of advice in this book. However, the author provides hardly any examples to illustrate the application of these suggestions. It's like listening to someone's know-it-all father preach about how you should behave. Not terrible... but not terribly interesting."
4,What It Takes to Be a Leader,"Lots of terrific information as to what a leader truly is. Maxwell uses anecdotes from the past, present, and his own life to get the points across. Inspiring to the point that while reading this book in bed, I jumped out and started sending work emails using some of Maxwell's practices. While it may seem a little slow at first, the book definitely picks up momentum."
4,Putting Leadership In Action,This a Good book it serves it's purpose. This book describes in action what a leader should be. A must book to read for anyone who is in leadership from CEO to Pastor. Apply it to your circumstances.
1,Don't Buy John Maxwell's Leadership Books,"They are all identical. He reminds me very much of TV evangelists. No advice that is worth your money. Go buy ""We Shall Not Fail: The Inspiring Leadership of Winston Churchill"" or ""Speak Like Churchill, Stand Like Lincoln: 21 Powerful Secrets of History's Greatest Speakers"". I beg you."
1,Do Not Waste Your Money,This book is a bore and contains no useful information.The book has so many quotes of others that it seems the author couldn't develop an original thought were he paid to.Save your money or spend it on something worthwhile - this isn't.
2,Maxwellism and the plague of the church,"The leadership principles of John Maxwell are very practical, but they are more about top-down leadership than the leadership that Jesus taught and modeled. If you want a few practical tips on how to be a domineering leader, this book is for you. If not, pick up a book on the topic of servant leadership. Don't look for a quick fix that will make leadership easier than being in the trenches loving one another. My disagreement with this book is more out of my feelings of what a leader should be, not with the way Maxwell wrote. The church isn't a business and shouldn't be ran like one; It should be ran out of love."
1,Helpful Book,"I ordered what I believed to be a ""NEW"" book, but it came to me as a ""USED"" book, even with a personal inscription inside to the previous owner. I was annoyed but on a 'time crunch' for a class using this book, so I couldn't send it back for a new one. I will be more cautious, IF I purchase from Amazon again or from the Seller, ""nonchalantd"". In fact, the ""condition"" on the product detail said, 'NEW'. Deceiving or blatant lie?"
5,Great book on personal development,"As a junior in college I was desperately looking for a book that would help my personal development. I was running around without a sense of direction and I was running out of time. After reading this book, I changed my entire view on life and choosing a career. This is not only a book for current leaders, but a book to find the leader within you. I reccomend this book to anyone who is interested in challenging and developing personally."
5,Joy-edp,"The best book I have ever read on Leadership...Has helped me to grow in life and become a batterHusband, father and employee"
5,Favorite short read on leadership,I have studied the subject of leadership for several years and continue to return to this book as the best short-read on the subject ever written. I read it at least once a year just to refresh myself. The stories are well chosen and the principals are sound. It is not an in-depth treatise but provides an excellent foundation for understanding the difference between leadership and management - which is greatly lacking today.
4,The old kook at Klooks Kleek,"This is Mayall's first (pre-Clapton) album, a live concert at a club called Klooks Kleek. The polite, schoolboyish way in which Mayall introduces each track is charming. Nothing boyish about the music, though. Mayall's occasionally whiny voice is grittier and more approachable here, and the didactic purism of his later works is absent. The emphasis is on fun and the largely unknown musicians are clearly having it, as is the audience. Which ought to include you. The CD edition also includes bonus tracks consisting of singles Mayall recorded during this same period. Maybe 3d or 4th best of Mayall's first decade (after Clapton, Laurel Canyon, and perhaps Crusade)."
4,Pictures of You/Fear of Ghosts,"This is *not* a new version of the song ""Pictures of You"". While there is a new version on an Australian soundtrack, this CD contains the single remix released in 1990 and widely available on the ""Galore"" compilation. ""Fear of Ghosts"" isn't a bad companion for ""Pictures of You"" and it's finally been mastered according to Smith's original intention."
3,Singles still exist?,"There's no doubt that these are two excellent songs, but I would suggest spending five more bucks on a used copy of ""Disintegration"", if you really want ""Pictures Of You"" that bad. ""Fear Of Ghosts"" is on the new box set ""Join The Dots"", and is well worth the high price tag. Just a suggestion."
5,Great Ink product,"Wish I could get more of the dual pack of the 23 & 24 Lexmark inks at a reasonable price, with no shipping charge."
4,Pokemon Great Value !,Package arrived in about 2 days after ordering ! This group is a great value and variety. My daughter loved seeing which Pokemons arrived and opening each package. I would really like to find group that includes Ash and Misty at a reasonable price.
4,Right cartridge for my printer,"Does what it's supposed to do, I don't print much so I can't attest for high volume printing but it suits my needs. Will purchase again. I tried using non oem but they don't work in my lexmark x4550."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"I learned more from Vince in ""Advance Airbrush Art , How to Secrets from the Masters"" by T. Remus, then from his book Professional Airbrush Techniques. I wished I would haved saved my money for paint.I was looking forward to this book, but now will just file it away or give it to someone.Do not waste your money"
5,Great Item!,This is Wonderful Cologne! Smells great not to overpowering! Very good value! I will for sure purchase this item again very happy with my purchase!
3,Some people liked it.,"It smells like grass almost and a few hours later i smell it and relate it to the smell of Raid roach spray.But I asked one girl, she liked it. But i don't like it too much. If anything spend a few dollars more and get Adidas Deep Energy. I purchased this and i enjoy the scent as much as i enjoy the price.Adidas Deep Energy by Adidas For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4-Ounces"
3,A simple guideline for conducting Translation Research,This book is highly recommended to under-graduate students of translation who are interested to conduct research in the field of translation.
1,needs 20.00 for rubber back wheel,It s all rigt for little kids.(...)not to(...) littleBY A RAZOR E300/S OR E200/S

1,I thig it its craprap,E100 they are a peice of junk.my brother had two e100 and they broke in a week.This prodect is junk.I think they shoud put in junk yard wars.This scooter barrly can go up a stuped stiken hill.[DO] [NOT] [BUY].ERIN
1,how much the 100 is a rip off,i have a e100 and it was so much of a rip off i spend $185 on it and it didnt work.so dont buty it if u believe me.
1,WORST SCOOTER,"I bought my razor e100 1 week ago. The first day or so was great, untill the engine would not stop accelerating. This problem continued for many days, until I decided to contact razor. they said that they would send me a new part to fix it. this scooter is really bad quality(...)"
1,hunk of junk,This thing lasted about 2 weeks before the back tire started bumping and making a horible noise. I talked with some friends who have the same skooter and they also had this problem. WARNING:DO NOT BUY THIS SKOOTER. IT IS A WASTE OF YOUR MONEY!!!!!!
2,"Houston, We have problems","I got this scooter as an early birthday present and I LOVED IT. It was the greatest thing. At least until it started getti-n-g -s-l-o-w-e-r, even on a full charge. Then It just stopped moving. So we took it apart and fixed it. Then It stopped again. I still haven't fixed it. I'm getting a new scooter that hopefully won't break. The E100 scooter was slow anyway."
1,I can't believe this horrible product!,"I got this scooter for my 11th birthday. Unlike a lot of other reviews, this scooter's charger works just fine. The problem is the wheel. The back wheel is plastic so its not as ""sturdy"" as the rubber one. After using the brake on the scooter for a few days, the wheel skidded off!I would seriously not reccomend this scooter. The other reviews aren't kidding!"
1,THIS THING IS A BUCKET O' BOLTS,"This scooter stinks! I was was very excited when I first opened it, but the every time you use the brake, even if you push on it a little bit, the back tire skids. Now, it makes really bumpy sounds, and it is a terrible ride. I got it instead of a gas powered scooter because I thought it would sound silent, now this scooter is louder than a gas powered! I had to replace a screw in 2 days, and a piece fell off when I was riding. This thing literally falls apart. Not to metion the speed, UGH! The ad says ""Reach speeds of up to 10 miles per hour!"" More like 4 mph. Overall, this thing is HORRIBLE! Do NOT buy it!"
1,THIS IS THE BIGIST PEICE OF CRAPRAP I EVER SEEN!!!!!!,This is the biggest peice of crap wrap ever oh and did i menchin that this was the bigest pice of crap rap ever?Ibought one of the peices of craprap with the money I saved but it broke after a week.I never seen suck a big pile of poop in my life and I mean it was a big pile of poop to.I hope you got something out of this.my name is eric
1,worst scooter,it was so slow and ran out of battery fast i reccomend not selling them they are a bad product and i am buying a new one and throwing that one away it always stalled and it is good for a 5 year old not a 12 year old like me i hope that you see that it was a waste of product try getting a faster and longer lasting scooter i rated everything a 1 because i road down they street and didnt even make it home because it died so just please listen to me and discontinue it and when i was there today i saw a lot looked liked they were tookin back well that is all i have to say and just quit selling them
2,Still deciding,i am looking to buy an electric scooter but the thing that dissapionts me with the e100 is first of all its tires they are not as bis as i would like and the slow speed something a bit faster please. My first choise is the e200 the e300 is a bit too fast and cost a lot
1,Not good,I got this e100 month ago and hate it.We have alot of problems with it.It makes noise and dont charge up so good.It sits in my garage cause i cant get the thing to work and my mom is mad at razor.
3,Our experience,"The store told us there was no weight limit for this scooter. Luckily, my son was w/i the limit but on the high end. It didn't seem to have a lot of power with someone on the higher end of the range. Charge didn't last long and my son ended up having to push it if there was much of a hill."
1,cheap cheap cheap,"my husband and i bought this for our son for christmas.he has waited a couple of months for it to be nice enough to ride. we've charged it twice and now it won't work.it was a BIG waste of money.it was fun the two times he got to ride it, but that isn't worth 100 bucks. next time i will buy a different brand."
4,e100 electric scooter,hello my name is selina and i really really love riding my e100 electric scooter. When i got it on christmas day i was riding it and riding it all day long. It is a really really good scooter. It is a really good scooter all the people that said it's bad must of put it together wrong or something but it is quiet. Everyone looks at you and just wonders i wish i had one of them. i hope if you get one you enjoy it as much as i do!!=)
2,good but not for me,i got this scoter for my tenth birthday and i loved it at first but now it is sooooooo slow. It goes about 5 to 8 mph. The charger is broken and the front tire is flat. i recamend this for 7and 8 year olds. I wasted my money this thing.
2,Definitely better scooters,"Looking for something new and exciting, I purchased the Razor E100 Electric Scooter not too long ago. I was thrilled with the fact that I didn't have to physically do anything (besides pushing a button) to move the scooter, yet I gradually became disappointed with the speed as well as overall size of the scooter. At first it seems like the scooter goes rather fast, but when you compare it to, say a Razor 'A' Scooter, it goes incredibly slower. It seems as though this scooter is a hassle to move from place to place, for it is heavy and takes up a lot of space. I find that manual scooters are easier to carry and simply manuever about an area. If you're looking for a FUN scooter, spend the extra cash to get a Razor E300 or even a motor scooter and you won't be disappointed. It is a waste of money to buy this scooter- in fact, I'm selling mine right now (...)! Trust me on this one! DON'T BUY IT!"
1,This Thing Sucks,I've had this Razor E100 Electric Scooter for about one month. I have charged it about 15 times. Now the battery has died and I called the number for razor so I can replace and they haven't even called me back yet. This scooter sucks. I bought this for my daughter and my son. And I bought the Razor E300 for myself and my wife. The E300 is so strong. I feels like I am going 16 miles per hour. And I've had this for almost six months! I haven't had to replace the battery or anything. I think the E100 is really cheap and it is built cheap too. Such a waste of money. I'll have to return it and get my kids the E300 or another one like that. Don't waste your money on this. After the fifth or sixth charge the miles per hour drops to about 3 or 2. I would never suggest this to anyone. And mostly all the reviewers agree with me. Buy the Razor E200 or E300 Electric Scooter the E100 is a waste of $100.00
1,nott good at all,I hate my e100 scooter.it does not work and my dad can not get any where with razor.I spent my own money on it 120.00 now it is broke after 2 weeks.I hate it
1,back tire becomes square after one time using the brake,"I got this scooter for my ninth birthday, and whenever I put on the brake (hand brake) the back tire would skid and flatten out. It is a solid rubber tire in the back and pneumatic tire in the front. Pretty soon I felt like I was riding Fred Flintstone's scooter because the back tire was flat and the ride was bumpy. The E200 and E300 have air tires in front and back so I'm sure they don't have the same problem. We returned it to [our local store]. What a bummer. I'll probably get a Mongoose."
1,Fun Scooter for a few days then it breaks down,This scooter is a really neat and fun idea. We purchased for my 8 yr old sons birthday. After about a week the bottom plastic piece had broke from him running over uneven cement and then the belt twisted and the scooter started to make a funny noise and he can not ride it now. I see that it is now recalled and I am not sure why but I hope I have not wasted $100.
1,crapy,the second week i had iwent up a tiny slant and my belt ripped in half and the back tire piece where the belt goes got chipped alot.SO DO NOT BUY THIS
2,whompa wheel,"We got this scooter and the E200 for our sons. Within 24hrs the hard, plastic back wheel had ground down from breaking, causing the scooter to move awkwardly with a whompa sound. My son refused to ride it. Contacted Razor and they said the wheel had been improved upon and sent me another wheel assembly. Looked like the same thing. I had to put it on - not easy to line up right. That wheel assembly lasted three months and then the ball bearings fell out. This time Razor had me send it to them postage paid though I had to pay the packaging which was about as much as the scooter cost new. Within days of the new wheel we were back to the whomping. Razor doesn't return calls or respond to emails now. Sits in the garage un-used."
1,Whoa! This is BAD!,"This thing is horrible! The first couple of times you ride it, it's great, but then the back tire gets bumpy from braking. Even if you squeeze on the hand break a little bit. The front tire is fine because it's filled with air, but the back tire is like a plastic, so when you ride it more and more the back tire wears down, which makes for load sounds, and a terrible bumpy ride. Pieces and screws fall off, and it goes really slow. Like 4 miles per hour slow. Don't trust the ads. If you're looking for an Electric Razor Scooter, then get an E-200 or E-300, both tires on those are filled with air, so it gives you a great, smooth ride. Overall: Do NOT get an E-100!"
1,Not worth the headaches,I got this scooter e-100 for christmas and have problems all the time.The back wheel wore down to the inner tube in the first 2 weeks.Now it makes alot of strange noisy.Now we can't get the scooter to charge up.My mom gets no response from razor and the replacement parts would add up to cost more they we paid for the scooter.It is not worth it trust me.I am 9 years old.
2,"Spend a little more, and get a better one!!!!!","I purchased this scooter for my son. One month after we bought it the belt broke. I had to spend hours on the phone and finally razor sent me another one. After all of this I went back Toys r Us and bought a buyer protection plan. One month later I was glad I did, the belt broke again. I called Razor and the belt is on back order 4-6 weeks. This toy was too expensive to be a disposable toy, and since we have had it, it has been broken done more than my son has been able to ride it. We are going today to Toys R Us and exchange it for a better one. I wish now I would have spent the extra money in the beginning. I do however recommend the buyer protection program. It really is a great feature at Toys R Us. I hope this helps someone."
1,Crazy woman!!,You may get a cardio workout but it will be frustrating. Amy Bento is not a good instructor. She blurts out what moves to do and starts with no direction. If you don't know her terminology you will probably have difficulty keeping up. I've been doing aerobics & kickboxing for 10+ years and would not recommend this to anyone.
5,KICK MY BUTT!,I am a fitness professional that every once in a while needs a butt kicking from someone other then me & this video delivered! Cathe and Amy Bento are two fitness professionals who release the beast!
2,okay melodrama....fuller style,"Army sergeant, Robert Stack, working undercover, breaks up a syndicate led by expatriate Robert Ryan, in this hard-boiled melodrama set against the urban sprawl of post-war Japan. Expert commentary by Fuller scholars James Ursini & Alain Silver makes it all seem rather more interesting than it is - yet, effective characterizations abound, notably Stack's taciturn investigator, later honed to perfection as The Untouchables' Elliot Ness, a radiant Shirley Yamaguchi as the love interest, and Robert Ryan as an unusually sympathetic villain (more avuncular than sexually ambivalent, as suggested by some commentators).The letterboxed image is fine, though the drab color transfer blunts the immediacy of Joe McDonald's on-location photography."
3,".......... ""MUSHIE---MUSHIE"" ..........","I agree with Zack's take on this movie...I had just returned from two [2] sojourns in Kyoto, Japan [ 1954]...and I found this movie/DVD lacking of any Japanese mystique to a great degree...standard crime movie with the predictable ending, all taking place in Tokyo, Japan [1955]....yes, where were the Yakusa??...Robert Stack and Robert Ryan headline with the charming Shirley Yamaguchi, but that's all you get for your time and effort; incidentally, Director: Sam Fuller lured Shirley Yamaguchi away from her wealthy/socialite lifestyle in NYC...to return to her native Japan for this 20th Century Fox cinemascope picture, she remained onboard for a few more flicks and then, just disappeared from the silver screen forever."
2,Not Sam Fuller's best work,"Because this was an early widescreen CinemaScope film, Sam Fuller included a lot of wide shots to show off his location, Japan, and also take advantage of the new format. But he should have used more close shots. You'll find that it's tougher to engage with a film shot like this, and it has far less emotional impact. Another problem is Robert Stack -- he can't really act and is not enjoyable to watch. Robert Ryan is excellent, however, as he usually is and well worth watching. But, overall, the film is less than satisfying. It probably intrigued audiences when first released, but it doesn't hold up today. Buy it only if you're a big Robert Ryan fan. It's not by a long shot Sam Fuller's best work."
2,I think Robert Stack wandered in from another movie,"This is not a ""typical"" Fuller effort. He goes for the Cinemascope view of post War Japan, pictures of blossoms and Mt Fuji and is lumbered with that sorry excuse for a performer, Robert Stack with his mannered wanderings - whether in a hurry or standing still he seems to be strolling along - and his full range of expressions from A to B. The drama gets to be placed secondary to the scenery and the suspense likewise droops much as I imagined Ms Yamaguchi's desire drooped at the thought of giving Mr Stack a massage. Boy what a let down. Mr Ryan does his professional best but hey, he's always a trooper worth watching. Mr Godard allegedly thought this was Fuller's best film - if so he must have been high on some illegal substance at the time. No no Nannette? No no noir!"
2,Noir Misfire,"Robert Ryan never delivered a bad performance. His memorable portrayal of a Tokyo crime boss is the best thing in ""House of Bamboo"" (1955) - director Samuel Fuller's flat attempt at Japanese film noir. Ryan easily towers over Robert Stack's routine characterization, which looks like a dry run for ""The Untouchables."" Apart from Ryan and Joseph MacDonald's on-location CinemaScope photography, this reworking of the superior ""Street With No Name"" collapses at the starting gate."
1,Not a CDG,"Since I already have the Rocky Horror Soundtrack, I purchased this CD for the sole purpose of using it in my karaoke machine. The Karaoke CD is not a CDG CD in that the lyrics DO NOT appear on your screen. You must use a booklet with teeny-tiny printing to sing your favorite songs from Rocky Horror. I wanted to let everyone know about this before you purchase it."
5,Very good quality,"The product presented no problems. The attachable tube is flexible to allow reach to some difficult angles without turning the can upside down (as you may know, turning it upside down would spill out liquid chemicals inside). Overall a great product."
5,"Product a ""life saver""",This a product that simply does what it is expected to do...PC owners can't be without a way to clean out troublsome dust. I would recommend this product
3,"Ships ground only, seems kinda pricey...","Note to Amazon Prime customers, this WILL ship UPS ground, even if you have two-day air selected, so if you have other items bundled with this item, they'll go ground as well. (or at least they did with my order) Order this item seperately with standard shipping.For everyone else, it's two-pack of compressed air. I've gotten some stuck on dust out of my computer fan areas, and I've noticed the computer is running a few degrees cooler now, and these two cans will probably last a year or so.The price does seem a little high though... Staples had a two-pack of their generic brand for about half the cost, but that was only during a one-week sale, which I just happened to miss."
1,I only got half of what I ordered,It came in a pack of two. But was I disappointed when one of the can was completely empty and the top was cracked. GRRRRRRR!!!!!! The other can works all right I guess. Nothing amazing.
2,plodding,While this movie covers a period of history that gets no attention on this side of the pond it was slow moving and the action scenes were rather dull. Interesting but not someyhing that I would watch a second time. Kind of regret buying this one.
4,Do I agree with the 1st reviewer...,"NOT AT ALL. I found this book to stimulate my brain waves as it proceeded to enlighten me to the possiblity of ""brain-tampering"" to alter criminal behaviour. Though (I hope) this book is border-line science fiction , I fear that its future possibilty might in fact exist. It is both fast-paced and suspenseful. It is also somehat graphic..if you are ""squeamish"", I would suggest you forget the book, get a plate of cookies, a glass of milk and retire to bed early. But, as for me, I found it to be time well spent."
5,Big Trike,Great product. My son loves it and he rips on the thing. All the neighborhood kids want it and he is top dog while riding it. Sturdy and the perfect toy for an active young boy. Much safer than a bike for his age. We love it! Would definitely recommend it to others.
5,One of the Red Rockers best.,"This CD rocks from start to finish. Top of the Rock,Hot and Dirty, and My Hometown are the heaviest songs on this cd. They simply rock. Missing You and He Will Understand are a couple of the best ballots that Sammy has ever sang. Animation,Valley of the Kings, and Giza are reminisent of Sammy's earlier solo recordings. Whiter Shade of Pale is an excellant cover done to perfection.Neal Schon handles all of the Guitar duties with ex-Santana bandmates Kenny Aaronson and Micheal Shrieve. This CD is a must have for all Sammy fans."
3,Great idea...,"but not enough letting loose. Great songs, great playing... ""but something's missing"" It was the greatest idea to come out of 1984. 2 or 3 more songs, maybe something live... who knows? I play it all the time & it's going on 22 years now. Buy it & see for yourself."
3,1st side only!,"The first 5 songs on this disc are great, simple rockers. Great playing too. But the 6-9 are really whipped up and thrown together. The last 4 songs are like throw away B-sides. I cant belive so many reviewers gave this disc 5 stars. Its not that great.. The first 5 songs are good. Valley of the kings reminds me of joe satriani. But its good for the first 5 songs only, then it starts to fall down hill and fail..."
4,HSAS from 1984,"I have this album in vinyl from 1984. It is some live music by an allstar band featuring Sammy Hagar and Neal Schon. Their version of ""Whiter Shyade of Pale"" is terrific. Obviously a good buy."
4,A ROCK CLASSIC !,"I bought HSAS when it came out for 2 reasons. Hagar and Schon. I was a fan of early Journey before Steve Perry and always a Hagar fan, so hey this had to be good right? Definitely !!!Schon did his best playing on the early Journey albums before Steve Perry was brought in and if you havent heard them your missing out, and this gave him the opportunity to revisit that stlye once again and he does some absolute shredding on HSAS. Sammy is Sammy. One of the best voices ever in rock, I dont care what anyone says truth is truth !Combine the two of them and HSAS had to be something special and that it is !! HSAS is a great classic rock album and very special because it was their only collaboration and it simply was magic. I always listened to HSAS on headphones because I wanted to soak every sound up."
5,Music CD: Hagar Schon Aronson shrieve---through the fire.,"This is a great CD. Hagar is at his best here. As a Karaoke singer, I only wish the songs ""Missing You"", ""She's Hot, She's Dirty"" and ""My Home Town"" were released in Karaoke format, I'd love to sing thesehttp://www.amazon.com/Through-Hagar-Schon-Aaronson-Shrieve/dp/B000000OMQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1290903598&sr;=1-1"
3,Not bad...,Something for diehards. Has material from Live in Las Vegas so not alot here new. If you aren't a big fan i would say get the other one OR this one. Interesting notes are Detroit Rock City movie Premiere and Tribute Band interview and performance.
5,Christmas Can be A Drag....Literally,"Oh My! I have to think that RuPaul purring ""Santa Baby"" is one of the best gifties I could find under my tree. And yes, ""I Saw Daddy Kissing Santa Claus"" is worthy or Red Peters, but much more attractive! This is yet another album of new and shiny renditions of some of our favorite (yet boring) holiday standbys and the Queen Herself manages to whip them up into a frothy eggnog worth buying. Infuse your holiday with some freaky and fun cheer courtesy of the girl who just can't help it."
1,Disappointing,I am a RuPaul fan but this recording does not live up to its potential. The backing tracks sound as though they are all out of a can: no real instruments and therefore not good arrangements. It sounds also as if it was done as quickly and cheaply as possible.
4,keys to understanding the phases of human/media development,"This book and its ideas have stayed with me over 15 years since university : Innis (who influenced Mcluhan) discusses the effect of changes in media on the history of civilization : ex. the invention of papyrus. sometimes obscure, but always a paradigm-shifter"
2,Not good,Did not like this movie. Was a waste of money and time. Did not even finish watching the movie. Boring
5,Oustanding job!,"Glad to see such a great depiction of Haitian Americans! Cute story, good acting! Funny! Hope films like this continue to be made!!"
5,LOVE IT!,"These two CDs are absolutely fabulous! As always, Byrne and the folks at Luaka Bob have put together yet another compilation of the best tracks off the hot albums offered by this label. The ""Steamy Hits"" CD is danceable and energetic, while the ""Slow Jams"" offers a lighter selection of still wonderful internationally flavored music. This is one of my favorite CDs right now!"
2,"maxell mf 2 hd, not in the box, but loose","30 loose floppies sent, not in packaging as noted, no sure of quality as I have not checked them all."
4,Works great,"Ordered to sand down drinking glasses, knowing it's a stained glass grinder. Got rid of jagged edges quickly with the bit that was included. Then I used a higher grit (320) to smooth more, but it still chipped a tiny bit, so then I went over with 600 and that didn't chip. I still had to go over it by hand to smooth edges out enough for drinking, but I know this isn't the ideal machine for sanding glasses. I recommend for hobbyist use for its intended purpose"
2,"Bad fit, despite measuring beforehand","Seemed like a good product from the photos, but when it arrived, the fit was not even close. It was so tight it was painful, and the lateral hinges were seated across the back of my knee which made it unbearable. Should have fit fine, according to the manufacturer's sizing guidelines. Not worth what I paid in postage."
5,For the child in all of us...hope....peace,"With the innocence of childhood embracing her, Lauren allows us all to accompany her and her mom and dad on what can only be termed a most incredible journey. A book is filled with beautiful, original illustrations, poetry, and hopeful insights into what it is like to lose someone you love. It offers very genuine reflections, in detail, of the good things that happen when someone dies. It also describes what is not so helpful at that time.The book is dedicated to Lauren's dad. With the honesty and innocence of an 11 year old, she proudly tells you of the courage both her dad and mom showed in facing the disease. Together as a family, they share a strength, both physical and spiritual, with readers of all ages. A tremendous resource for anyone facing these challenges in life. A ""must have"" book for parents, schools, support groups, hospitals, churches....This is an amazing faith journey written and illustrated by a very gifted young lady."
4,A must possess possession!,"You're a girl. You do dishes to Belly, you do 'the morose thing' to Tori, you sing along to the Indigo Girls like you're in front of a campfire. You need a record like this to live by, to function by. None of the aforementioned artists are on this record, but their ilk is. Kristen Hall's song is great, and who can not love a female remake of 50 ways to leave your lover? I would give it five stars but the included Fem2Fem, a terrible, terrible band whose savvy male manager, song writer etc. has made homosexuality their main selling point."
1,Whose favorites are these?,"I was very disappointed in the album, and it's title is an absoulute misnomer. No Indigo Girls, no Melissa Ethridge, no Ferrick, and no real good women's folk music that makes women's festivals so much fun! The folk bands that are represented on this album are represented poorly, as the compilers seem to have picked the most pop-sounding and over-produced cuts in the bunch..."
2,Not all lesbians are alike,"There are 3 appropriate songs on the album that pertain to Lesbian women. Either a closeted lesbo, straight woman or man must of created this album."
1,Beware the horrible green curse,"I own model 50A2000 SXRD since 12/06 and it recently was plagued by a greenish tint. Luckily, it was under warranty as the bulb & complete optical block had to be replaced. This is a great TV when it works properly. Bulb costs are crazy high though. Looking back I wish I went flat panel LCD instead."
5,Really Solid performer,"It's hard to respect the reviews from people who just recently opened the box. So I felt compelled to chime in: I have had this TV for 4 years now. It is great! (Of course I bought the 4-year warranty, so just paying the money on that probably ensured that I would never use the service). Have not had one single issue with it. Terrific picture, have never even adjusted the color settings-- Sony's regular color is so true-to-life. Just wish I could still buy one new for my parents now. I imagine in the next year or so I will want to replace the bulb... but then, I still will have a ""new again"" TV for another 5 years. Very cool."
2,Disappointing,Unfortunately nothing particularly helpful or practical when it comes to healing with energy or radionics. Much of the information has long been superseded.
4,English Grammar for Dummies,"Not as clear as I was hoping, but it is still a good reference if you have time to look through it a bit."
5,An Invaluable Reference for Language Studies!,"This unusually well-written book encompasses virtually all aspects of English grammar. It is well structured, strict to the point, meticulous and most importantly easy to use! It sheds lights on most common pitfalls and errors in grammar usage. People who experience difficulties with english grammar should find this book extremely useful. To my mind, this is a must for all students who seek to improve their language skills and to become more effective and proficient communicators and writers! Buy this book today!"
3,You may need more than this ifyouREALLy careaboutgrammar,The book is funny which is a plus. I dont think its for beginners though ifyoudo notalready have a strong grammar backbone itwonthelpthat much especially withthe really hard stuff like types of clauses andparticiples. Its a wonderful refresher of the basics but its not really for dummies or forthosewhowant to makesure that thebook willteach them the annoying harder parts. suchas chapters22 to the end I need a whole book onthose chapters.
5,jonh Mayall at his best.,"This was the first album I ever owned, I played the lp on a cheap stereo, now that my system has vastly improved I bought a cd copy of The Blues Alone and it is fantastic. Just John Mayall and Keith Hartley I feel that this is one of his best almost solo albums I have heard he plays all the instruments except for the drums if you are into John Mayall as I am this cd is a must to have in your collection"
5,Does the job,"I needed an algae pad, and I wanted a cheap one. My glass tank was covered in green and brown algae and I could barely see in! I didn't want to spend a fortune. This one was cheap and got the job done well."
5,Both film and deliverance were excellent!,"47 years ago I first saw ""Youth of Chopin"" and I have never forgotten it. Lately I discovered that it had come at DVD and I was thrilled, when I saw the film again. And it is a bless that Chopin is speaking Polish! Thank you!"
5,A Spiritual Journey,"India My Love is a mystery tour. Our guide on the journey is Osho, a man with an extraordinary gift for storytelling and a mystic who brings a uniquely contemporary freshness to the tales of India's golden past. He introduces us to beggars and kings, wise men and fools, lovers and warriors, artists and scholars - and they come alive on the page, animating the enchanted landscape of an India that even today continues to intrigue and attract the seeker and adventurer within us all."
4,Truly Indian Vision,"India My Love is one book that shine out in my Osho collection. The very fact is that I been sometimes gifting this book to people who are fond of Osho Discourses. This book is a gem of Osho Insight and truly Indian vision because no other spiritual leader has so vividly introduced the Real India and the spiritual beliefs. Osho speaks of yogis, fakirs, buddhist monks, jain gurus and all about ancient India. This book is not only about stories of saints and osho transcript of talks but also has great illustrated pics alongwith snippets about mystical India. The Krishna tales and Atista are topics that create a lot of interest to read and the liberation goal of osho is defined as one read through these pages. Osho unfolds cultural and spiritual aspects of the golden past of India. A good & Must Read for an Osho Fan. Great Pick."
3,The ninth edition isn't as good as previous editions,"I've been using Anton for my linear algebra classes since 1984, and have gone through nine editions. The ninth edition seems much more confusing than previous editions. He often moves text around without seeing that it makes sense in the new context: a theorem will use notation that isn't introduced until later, for example. He comes back to eigenvalues and eigenvectors over and over, looking at them from different perspectives. This should work if done well, but instead it confuses my students. I'm going to look for another book for the next time I teach the class."
2,Book causes unneeded frustration,"I am currently taking an Elementary Linear Algebra class for college and this book is beyond frustrating. The book barely covers any basics and examples are few and useless. The exercise sets provided are beyond the text and examples provided in the book. Even after purchasing a solution manual, the problems make little sense. Similar to another reviewer of this book, I have resorted to online discussion boards and youtube videos to compliment the lectures from class."
2,bad book,i'm an engineering major and this is the worst textbook i have used for any math/science class
3,A decent textbook,"The book isn't the best organized in some regards, but it's decently written and decently eyeball-scan-friendly."
1,elementary linear algebra,Was not the correct book and tried to contact various times with and never got a response
1,Worked great...for a bit,"It was a inexpensive and seemingly nice monitor for about 6 months, then the bottom 1/6th of my screen died. As in, the refresh rate for that part of the monitor slowly phased out and now I just have a jumble of pixels that are hiding my start bar.Long story short, go with a trusted brand because one way or another you'll be paying for it."
5,Great Product,"After purchasing a new flat screen monitor for my work PC, I was suprised by the low cost and immediatley visited a local electronics store to do some price shopping.This Westinghouse 19"" wide screen monitor stood out clearly as the best value for your money. It was effortless to set up and delivers a crisp and bright image with amazing detail.Shop around for the best price and check the reviews for this monitor. You will not be disappointed."
2,Great while it lasts,"I've had this monitor for about 10 months. Over the past 6 weeks, the picture has gotten fuzzier and fuzzier. Then, all of a sudden, the images get very crisp again for a few hours. After a while, it's back to the fuzziness all over. At times, it can be VERY difficult to read text on the web due to the contrast going out. Black text on white is still ok, but anything else is very hard on the eyes.[...]Let the buyer beware. It may be cheap, but don't expect it to last."
1,made badly,"This rolling backpack would have been ok except the zipper were poorly made. 2 days after we received it, the pull zippers broke on each area. We tried to fix it. Too costly and I do not sew.Will not purchase again."
5,great for the beach,Bought this based on a review I read. It was everything the reviewer said it was. Easy to set up and take down. Light weight and well made. Big enough that we'll use it again next year when the baby is mobile. Would definitely recommend this product - really feel it was worth the money.
1,Piece of Junk,We thought we had a real nice item until it broke after the 2nd use. One of the arms broke loose from the part at the top - and now the cabana is worthless because it can not be set up. I contacted the company and they have yet to reply. Don't waste your money!!!
2,Not what I expected,"I bought this for my 10 month old for the beach this summer, and after the second use, one of the posts snapped in half! We were not rough putting it up or taking it down, it is just cheaply made, and I think over priced. It was also very warm inside, even with the flap rolled up. It also would blow away with a strong wind unless you weighted it down. I was disappointed, especially after spending so much money!"
5,Great for Kids & Pets,I love this tent! It does just what it's supposed to do: goes up in a flash and is easy to collapse & fold away. It's also sturdy yet provides enough mesh so those enclosed can see out and not feel they're stuck in a cave. I travel with pets and use it to house them in hotel rooms. My daughter took one to the beach so that her baby could be near the family yet protected when she simply wanted to play quietly by herself.
3,Broke in the wind,"We bought this tent because we were going to Florida and wanted to make sure we had some shade for our 18 month old daughter. When we put it together at home to try it out, she loved going in and out of it. On the beach she wasn't interested in going into it at all. She just wanted to play in the sand. We thought she might nap in it but it was too hot for that and while we were at the beach all she wanted to do was play so it was best to go back to the room for naps. Our biggest complaint is that it is quite flimsy and broke in the wind. We can still use it but one of the plastic poles is broken. To be fair, I should mention that it is very easy to set up and take down. Perhaps it would be more useful for a younger baby and not on windy days."
3,"If you just wnat dino stickers this is for you, but not very practical as a reusable sticker book.","the dinos are cute. The books is only 4"" wide and 5 plus"" tall. The scene to put them on is a picture printed on the inside of the back cover. You are supposed to reuse the sitckers but need to replace them on the 2 pages you have to tear out to use cover. Mine never wnated to stick back well and some got lost. Others did not want to stick to pager more than 2 times. Will make a great disposable activity for kids is compact and fits in purse or bag."
5,it's my honor,"I love this show, I grew up watching it and remember it well. this is the first time iv'e seen it since it aired so each review will be fresh!!"
5,Best of Zap Mama,"Seven has a bit more of an R & B feel than A Ma Zone. It is a consistently incredible mix of Afropean rock and American Hip Hop, R & B, and Funk. I was very impressed by the compilations with Spearhead, although Michael Franti is depoliticized in his Zap Mama work (and vice versa). The understanding, blend, and use of such a variety of musical styles makes Zap Mama the most innovative artists today. And sheer talent!"
4,Zap Mama moving more mainstream?,"I've been a fan of Zap Mama since I first heard their first album. This album leans heavily towards an R&B style and is a much different sound than their past albums. I hope they're not going to stick with this style as I think they have a much tighter, cleaner sound with their first couple albums. I wouldn't pick this as your -first- zap mama album, but on the other hand, it grows on you."
5,This can elevate you to the stratosphere!,"By this album, there is no longer any doubt that Marie Daulne is, in fact, Zap Mama. The acrobatic vocal stylings of Zap Mama are still very evident here. They're still strange too; these women do things with their voices you've never heard before apart from this band. Singing in multiple languages and styles - many styles all their own. African instrumentation, R&B flavor, great stand-up basses, this list of musical elements is extensive.My favorite songs are ""Baba Hooker"" which is so cool the way it struts, and ""Illioi"" which has incredible percussion and bizarre atmosphere including a cute little boy speaking french. ""Poetry Man"" is an excellent cover of the Phoebe Snow song, pretty faithful but with more UUUMMMPH. Plus, it's got an actual ""poetry man"" who talks over the song in a very deep voice. Way cool."
4,La Voz - Bari Sax Reeds - Great Reeds!,"I'm not a professional or even seasoned musician, just an average saxophone player. For years I've used other brands but had never tried a La Voz. I was extremely pleased with the tone and response that the reed provides. I was surprised that the medium hard strength was stiffer than a 3.5 in other brands. I've had to slightly sand the face of a couple of reed until I get use to the stiffer response. I highly recommend this reed to anyone looking to improve or enhance their current tone produced with their instrument. John M."
3,Extremely basic information about the breed.,"It is basically a picture book with captions and some information in small paragraphs. It explains all things in basic terms and pictures. It has helpful information about the breed in history and relatives and some basic training styles to common health problems. It is more of a quick reference book, like cliff notes for more detailed books on GSDs, than anything else. I would recommend for younger readers or people that really like the breed and want just a basic, picture filled book to introduce people to the breed. I would also recommend for someone shopping for a dog and has yet to chose the breed, it explains how to pick a puppy and what is needed for the German Shepherd through out its life and would be a good reference to compare different breeds."
4,very good short no nonsense book,Compact size. Carefully put together information. Solid basics given without too many words but understandable. Pictures are very helpfull and exceptional quality. This is cheap and good book for novice GS owner. I favor this book out of 4 i bought before.
5,great book in great condition,I chose this book to learn a little more about my native female heritage and it came in record speed and in very good condition.
1,Daughters of the Earth,As a Native American woman I found this book to be very offensive. I was surprised by this authors lack of sensitivity and respect. The book is totally inaccurate and the author should be ashamed of herself.
4,Great Songs,Love the Blues and that girl can sing them. If you like blues and or Aretha get this disc.
4,Happy Accident,I bought this CD on a whim at a used CD store knowing absolutely nothing about it and what a great purchase it turned out to be. Anyone who likes a smooth blues sound coupled with a powerful voice will love this disc.
3,A good one for the self publisher,"There are a lot of answers in this volume, all very helpful to the self publisher. It covers so much ground, it may not address your specific need, but it is certainly one of the best available. Formating is the most difficult part of self publishing and this book will save you a lot of time and misery in that specific requirement."
1,Outdated.,"Could not believe the amount of work I had to go through if I were to use his ""methods"". By doing some internet research I found a company that has produced a piece of software that would convert any Word file into PDF format file without any problems, without a limited license. I paid $39.99 for the software but did not mind at all as it did a perfect job. This book, in my opinion, should be out of print."
4,Learn How to Format Your Book in MS Word,"Positives: (1) Aaron gives directions for formatting your book in MS Word 2003, 2004. He has thought of everything from margins to justification to turning off auto formatting tools that can corrupt your files. (2) His books is quick read, and organized in such a way that it is easy to return to as a reference when needed. (3) He also tells you how to make a simple book cover in Word.Negatives: (2) It's still worth it, but if you have MS 2007, you have to search a bit for some of the items he discusses. An updated version would be wonderful.Overall: If yo need to learn how to format your book in MS Word, this little gem of a book is a must have. It's definitely worth it!"
4,You don't know what you think you know!,"My wife and I are feeding the dream of our 11 year old by self-publishing her novel. I though I new MS Word well, until reading Perfect Pages. This is a must read for any self-publisher that used Word.- Jeff Marsico[...]"
5,This Book was Useful,I liked this book. I am just wading into self-publishing so all the information was relevant and useful to me. My only criticism is that it doesn't include information on Word 2007 as the author prefers the older version of Word.
5,Make Word much better,"This little book shows you how to use a word processor to produce results that are so much better than what the usual defaults produce. The book is oriented toward Microsoft Word, but I have used the ideas both in Word and OpenOffice to produce documents that look so much better on paper. Get this book and learn how really use a word processor."
2,Not all it's cracked up to be,"After all the hype about this book I expected much more. While he gives detailed step-by-step instructions for the easy stuff, he fails by skipping over the things that bedevil most readers. Describing a formatting procedure by saying ""you can do this under such and such tab"" is not an instruction. If you're going to write a how-to book, you must describe each step of the how. About a third of the 160 pages contain less than a half page of text, which the author could have put to good use."
4,Useful manual for users of Microsoft Word 2004 for Mac users,Aaron's book was very helpful for my first experience formatting a book to be self-published. Some of the topics were not detailed enough for me (ex: using styles for formatting). I used the software manual and online articles for help there. Worth the price!
3,Not Bad..... Using it for a Motorcycle Speedo..............,"I decided to purchase one of these for an alterative to my stardard MPH and milage guage for my motorcycle. I finally got the space and connections correct and it seems to work. A front motorcycle tire is a bit odd, compaired to a bicycle tire - size and travel. The speed has been off about 5-9 MPH slow and I will need to mess around with the tire size setup to dial it in. Should not be a problem.........But...... for milege, trip odometer, clock, light and other calculations, this unit should work close enough for what I'm looking for. I'm glad they sell replacment parts (sensors, etc) here for this bike computer !!"
2,It works,"It works. Not great, Not Horrible, but invest in The o-rings it uses to mount the computer, they last about 2 months. Very disappointed in this computer."
1,Forget Wireless! GO WIRED!,"I've had the Signam BC 1606L DTS for six months and both the speed sensor and cadence sensor take turns working. No amount of resetting or changing batteries seems to have any effect. Also, the speed sensor barely hangs on to aero forks so it requires a pieceo of scotch tape to ensure it doesn't bounce off balance and fly into the spokes (breaking the o-ring mount and sending the sensor into traffic). Buttons are completely unintuitive - impossible to remember which resets, which selects and which advances. For all the talk of digital signals the thing shuts down with a ""too many signals"" excuse if I'm using a polar heart rate monitor. Its complete rubbish - for $90! You'll find complete reliability for a wired version for $25."
3,Problems with device pairing to sensors,"I have been using this device for about a month now. At first I was very happy. Installing it was a breeze and I couldn't find a problem. I have recently moved to a urban area with long traffic lights. I find that if I'm stopped at a traffic light for a few minutes, or take a small break during my ride, the wireless connection is broken between the computer and the sensors. Once the connection is broken I haven't found a way to reestablish the connection.This is my first wireless computer. I do not know if this is a common problem."
4,Big numbers,"I had little difficulty locating the sensor and magnet in their correct locations on the wheel, but I thought that the setup of the computer was confusing. Also, I worry that if I hit the wrong button I will switch from English to French or some other language. I guess this is part of the learning curve. On the other hand, the large readout numbers are a boon for my deteriorating eyesight and make the setup problems only a minor annoyance."
4,Sigma Wireless w Cadence,"I generally like this computer but have had a few issues with it:1. I had issues with the original magnet and the Ksyrium SL spokes; a magnet replacement is fairly cheap and easy though.2. The cadence reading maximum is 180rpm. On the trainer I do warm-up sprints above this, but for some time thought that my legs just weren't moving fast.3. I always forget which button to press and hold for resetting.4. The batteries only lasted 11 months."
3,A Five star review - BY THE AUTHOR !!,"This may indeed be worthy of five stars (maybe), but personally I would be reluctant to buy a book where the only review is by the author trying to boost their ratings."
3,"A bit dated, assumes you know nothing","I was able to skim/read this book in a few hours. I have previously had and used a digital camera, so I am not a complete newbie, so some of the sections were a review. A couple of the chapters were nice to read since I've only had a point and shoot digital (and currently looking to get a digital SLR), so I didn't know much about lenses, f-stops, etc.My biggest problem with this book is that the information is old. To me, it seemed that it was even older than the copyright date of 2002. The chapters on what to look for in a digital camera, and how to select one list technology that has been discontinued, such as digital cameras using floppy disks to store their pictures. There is also no discussion of shooting in RAW picture format.In Summary, this book is strictly a beginners book, but I would not suggest it even for beginners due to the out of date information."
5,message from the author,"While researching and writing this book, I discovered a little secret: You don't have to be a techie to have fun with digital photography. I've come to realize that it's possible for anyone to enjoy the instant gratification and creative freedom that digital photography provides. I've designed this book to be your guide as you explore the exciting world of digital photography. It is intended for anyone who has considered purchasing a digital camera but is not sure where to begin, already owns a digital camera and wants to get more creative with it, or would like to experiment with digital images made from scanned 35mm photos. You'll find tips on purchasing digital cameras, scanners, printers, and software, plus pointers on taking greatphotos and getting the most from digital photography. I invite you to join me in creating, using, and sharing digital photos. Read, learn, experiment, and enjoy!"
1,Poor covers of the originals,"I purchased this album thinking it was actually the listed artists performing the songs. Sadly, I was mistaken. They don't even sound similar."
5,You've Never Heard Anything Like This,"At once completely alien and yet with the instant appeal of someone like Hank Williams. Sr. (Although it sounds about as close to ol' Hank as the blenders Sr. Ze uses in one of his songs). There are samba rhythms that weave in and our of bizarre acoustic and electronic soundscapes while some of the most incidious hooks you've ever heard infiltrate your consciousness. the Captain Beefheart comparisons are appropriate, but not totally informative.Even if you're familiar with other Tropicalisima artists, you may not be fully prepared for Tom Ze. Os Mutantes are briulliant, yet their music is steeped in the psychadelic tradition and, thus dates itself. the same could be said for Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil (althrough through the ages).Absolutely nothing on here sounds dated. It could have just as easily been made today as in 1960 or 2025. The one constant is the sense of melody and playfulness that prevails over the whole CD. Just freakin' great. Really."
5,A Wonderful Listening Experience,"I purchased this CD to introduce me to the Brazilian Tropicalia sound. I was pleasantly suprised! Tom Ze comes across to me as a sort of Brazlian Captain Beefheart, yet far more accessible. He often shrouds his songs in bizarre arrangements, sometimes using objects like blenders and vacuum cleaners to fill out his sound. The songs themselves on this CD are all super-catchy, so even if you aren't well-versed in Portugese it shouldn't matter. The result of his experimentation and everything else is both incredibly original and irresistable. If you're interested in something a little out of the ordinary, I highly recomend this top-notch CD!"
5,Ze for yourself...,"Tom Ze is like no other creature in the land of music. He creates a sound that is completely his. His beautiful imagination creates intriguing lyrics. His voice isn't anything amazing, but he plays with it to make it into a completely new instrument. Ze explores numerous genres, and inverts them into a addictive sour stew of sound. He is sensitive and precious while rough around the edges. Tom Ze is a cute, sparkling gem shining in his own chaotic world. I urge curious listeners to take a bit of time to explore this charming world of Ze."
4,"May 2006 - quiet, good PC","For months Sony was not supporting an upgrade to MCE 2005. I was shocked, complained, ignored by Sony and MS, and then - Sony changed its mind and for $10 the upgrade was on its way. In the last few months I've added a 1GB RAM, 400GB drive and an ATA HDTV tuner card, all have worked well. For a monitor I use a 21 inch CRT and Sony WEGA TV. I really, really appreciate the liquid cooling. The lack of fan noise - Priceless! The SD and other card readers, and firewire ports work well - I'd almost give it a five stars, but a Mac G5 does video editing and Linux live-CD iso burning better, so when an equally powerful and quiet PC shows up, it will get the five star rating."
4,Its definitely Satriani but it still sounds like Ridge Racer,The album is very good but if you have heard some of th titles he has recorded for some of the Sony Playstation games you will hear some VERY similar ideas. But being a true die hard Satch fan I love it! Basically it is the new style of things to come. All California bands are seeming to go this route of the techno meets rock and Joe just decided to follow suite. It works though and is fun to listen to!
5,Just like good old Jeff Beck...,"A beautiful tune (IMHO, one of the best guitar snogs ever!) came to my mind when I heard ""Until We Say Goodbye"". It was ""Cause we ended up as lovers"", by legendary Jeff Beck.I began to listen to Satriani recently, and already own a couple of his albums, so I'm no expert on him, but I'm not afraid to say you'll love this one!"
5,Still the best!,"My husband and I have all of Satriani's CDs. This one is quite different, but still great. I have always liked techno music and other genres, but techno added with his guitar is amazing. One of the best tracks is #3 Borg Sex. I also enjoy Devil's Slide. Until We Say Goodbye is close to what he normally records. I am glad to see that he trying to change his sound so that no one can ever say he records the same old thing. I could never get bored with this CD. I use it when I am kickboxing. The CD itself is a great workout!"
4,Not at all banal--an intelligent fusion of guitar & dance,"It seems like a long time ago, when my mind threw away the typical pop-radio fare and really began to appreciate mesmerizing music. First I explored as much classic rock as I could; there was so much I hadn't ever known about. Then as a budding guitarist, I discovered and latched onto musical geniuses like Steve Vai, Eric Johnson and Joe Satriani. Yeah, The Ultra Zone and Engines of Creation may be much different than traditional guitar albums, but SO WHAT? The key question is do you have an open mind to other musical genres? Dance, R&B, and Jazz are just a few types that also have a lot to offer. Try to find beauty in everything. Let your mind grow to accept what is strange, but valuable, and you will find new wonders. In this new album, Satch uses the latest pc software and of course his brilliant guitarist mind to bring something new to light. It's anything but ordinary."
4,great cd,it is a very good satch cd. Better than i expected it to be. I didnt like at much when i first heard but after a couple of listens i started to like it alot
2,"NO,NO,NO","I REALLY LOVE JOE SATRIANI,BUT THIS IS NOT THE JOE THAT I KNOW.WHERE IS ALL THE GREAT GUITAR WORK.JOE,PLEASE GET RID OF THE HORRIBLE KEYBOARDS.YOU DON`T NEED THIS.GO BACK TO THE PLAYING YOU DID ON THE EXTREMIST.VERY BIG DISAPOINTMENT.BUY IF YOU MUST,BUT YOU WHERE WARNED."
2,The Emperor Has No Clothes,"Take a 20 year old Kraftwork style high compression, industrial strength technoelectricpop rhythm track and lay over some cliche modern guitar licks and you've got this newest disappointing effort from Satch. The best cut is a Jeff Beck flavored tune called ""Until We Say Goodbye"" and is the only one on which real supporting musicians with real instruments appear. There are a few moments of interest like those found in ""Champagne?"" making this really a 2.5 star release. Some may say this is an experimental release and highly artistic. I think it sounds more like the soundtrack from a bad flick. Listen before you buy."
4,Only Satriani could do it so well!,"Being a huge fan of the Crystal Planet album, I was very excited to get my hands on this one. It's definitely a departure from previous albums, but after listening to it several times, Satriani's genius and skill still shines through. I've seen a lot of negative comments about this album, but I truly love it. I think it's hard to go from rock to such an electronic sound and still keep some dignity, but he did it brilliantly. Great Album, glad I got it!"
4,Joe stretches out,"Joe Satriani spent most of the 80s and 90s lending legitimacy to instrumental rock guitar. While many of his contemporaries seemed completely incapable of slowing down Joe played over his compositions with a tastefulness and restraint, always seeming to play the right note at the right time. So you can imagine the surprise fans got when Joe decided to record an album in a style of music looked upon by most guitarists as dubious at best: Techno.Don't be misled by that statement, though. This is not something you'll ever hear in a night club - this is not instrumental rock techno, this is techno instrumental rock. The almost supernatural feel for melody is still present, the sense of hope that seems to pervade almost all of his songs. It's just that this time it all happens inside of a techno beat. This is a must-have for any big Joe fan, but probably not for those just getting familiar with his work."
1,Let's Dance... NOT!,"If I want music to dance to, I'll listen to 'N-Sync and the Backstreet Boys... When I buy a Joe Satriani CD, I expect quality listening music. This is uninspired, obviously programmed, pseudo-creative nonsense. I hope Joe didn't actually believe his listeners would blindly accept this, because most won't. Unless you want to dance to mediocre guitar solos - avoid this CD."
1,"Farewell, Joe...","This album is such a total disappointment that I might boycott Satriani forever; this after years of buying his CDs unheard, thus allowing him to attempt this cross-over (knowing he could count on a certain number of sales from others like me - expecting a quality album with integrity...). Rock instrumental fans will hate this CD as it's barely rock (maybe two songs) - and the techno dance beats are nauseating... Just skip this one; there's no innovatin here - or taste."
1,Where is it?,"Innovation? I've listened to this CD numerous times. There's nothing innovatiove here. Joe needs to stick with what he does best - awesome rock instrumentals. I can say that Flavor Crystal is a powerful tune; but Joe's melody and power are elsewhere invisible on this CD - and listeners are guided through an exploration of computer generated beeps, buzzes, FX, and dance rhythm sounds. Joe, give us a break!"
1,Sorry - this one is a 'no go',"People who like this CD tend to criticize those who don't like it: They are dinosaurs, they are 'stuck in the past'... That's false. I listen to everything. My personal opinion of Joe is that he's the best rock guitarist that ever lived. So I'd say, leave techno for the techno-heads, and go back to what you do best. Decent try here, but it's just not a good sound... Sorry."
2,"Disappointed, (so far)","I've listened to EOC now for the first three times through. I am not impressed with the electronics used for backing up such a GREAT Axe-Man. I believe that any Rock/Progressive Rock/Metal guitar player needs REAL people playing REAL instruments giving it that human feel. That makes music whole. I'll have another review of EOC when I've listened to it several more times. Oh, BTW, the guitar work is great!"
3,Creativity is the word,Don't come to this with expectation of Joe just churning out another Extreamist or similar. He is a creative person and as such likes to do things a little different each time.This has grown on me and will grow on you if you have an eclectic taste in music. Buy it you may like it.I only give 3 stars because I am a bit oldfashoned and am not wild about sequenced drums at 400bpm or some tracks which sound like 'Fire starter'. I would give 5 stars for being creative and think his fans should give him room to explore musical ideas.
3,SATRI AGAIN,"I LOVE SATCHES TUNES. HE IS BY FAR THE BEST. UNFORTUNEATLY THIS CD IS NOT. I WAS ANXIOUS TO GET IT WHEN I HEARD OF IT'S RELEASE. ASIDE FROM ""UNTIL WE SAY GOODBYE"" THERE IS NOTHING BUT NOISE. I KNOW JOE WILL COME BACK STRONG, AND I HOPE HE STICKS TO HIS NATURAL TALENT AND DOES'NT RELY ON TECHNO. I GAVE IT 3 STARS CAUSE IM A BIG FAN. IF YOUR REALLY IN THE MOOD FOR A CD WITH MULTIPLE GREAT SOUNDING GUITAR TUNES, TAKE A PEAK AT DENIS TAAFE'S ABDUCTED BY ALIENS. OTHER GUITARISTS THAT ROCK LIKE SATCH ARE: STEVE VAI, ERIC JOHNSON, DENIS TAAFFE, TONY MACALPINE, AND VINNIE MOORE."
2,strangest Satriani album ever!,"Simply judging from the high number of 1, 2 & 3 stars(60%),you could tell this aint his best.It's more of guest starring Joe Satriani; an experiment in sound, techno synth, & electric keyboards. Not the same old shred guitar rock album.He has a right to be different, experiment, and grow as an artist, but not to ask his fans to pay hard earned $ for his delusions."
5,Guitar Virtuosity + Future Technology = Great Music,"Taking a page out of Jeff Beck's book, Joe Satriani has decided to reinvent his musical inclinations with _Engines Of Creation_. Taking its title from the premier text on Nanotechnology (by K. Eric Drexler), this album takes Satriani's established credentials as a guitar virtuoso and immerses them in the realm of progressive electronica. Though he has had little experience in this genre previously, the compositions work wonderfully, merging sequencer riffs with drum programming and guitar solos. At times the music sounds like late '90's Ozric Tentacles, and at times it bears resemblance to Liquid Tension Experiment, but ultimately, _Engines Of Creation_ is a unique album, based upon the advent of credible future technology. Great stuff."
1,Engines of pseudo-creation,"There is nothing original about this CD - it's a collection of sampled beats and FX. It's not bad if you like techno (which I don't - hence my interest in Satch, whom was doing 'real' music until this thing...).""Until We Say Goodbye"" is decent - as is ""Flavor Crystal""; but annoying cartoon-background themes fill the rest of this project.Those who bought Satriani CDs for lush, melodic, rock guitar pieces will not like this CD; which sounds nothing (NOTHING!) like the Satch I knew and loved.A lot of people are saying this is something different for him, and so it's good - but I don't buy that, as not everything different or new is good (otherwise every new band would have to be rated as good!)Also, I believe that Satriani achieved his success by deveolping a faithful following of rock guitar fans; to switch styles so dramatically like this is absurd - if not a very bad marketing move.Sorry to say - it's not worth buying..."
5,Awesome album.,"EOC is not primarily Electronic like some of these people are saying. Listen closely, and you will see it is a more guitar based album than a Electronic one. I think some of the sounds on this album are being mistaken for Electronic, but it's 94% guitar.Some of you whom are stuck in the past need to widen your musical tastes more, if not then go listen to burnout guitarists such as Clapton, or Santana who choose to stand still. Pretty boring if you ask me? (and highly overrated as guitarists.)"
4,Solid Electric Sound,"I've had this CD for years, but I keep coming back to it because the sound is so good. I cranked it up so loud on the headphones on a flight the other day I was afraid I might be disturbing the passengers on either side of me. It's really pleasing music to me."
3,A rock travel through electronic music,"I would never say this is one of the best albums from Joe Satriani, but it's plain to see the influence of Eric Cadieux, producer for Jean Michel Jarre for years, gave another way of inspirations and resources to this veteran rock guitarist. Although in some tracks the electronic stuff gets a little bit too much, there's a long range of styles in it, from pure heavy metal to soft melodic ballads. The jewel you find in every record ('Echoes' from 'Surfing with the Alien', 'New Blues' from 'The Extremist', 'Baroque' from 'Time Machine' or 'Love Thing' from 'Crystal Planet' is in this case 'Until We Say Goodbye', a beautiful ballad with claever guitar, and an outstanding middle part with awesome free guitar soloing. Only for this track it's worthwhile to have the record, although 'Champagne', Flavour Crystal 7' or the meditative 'Clouds Race Across the Sky' are good as well."
1,Some New Adventures are Not Good...,"This is not a good CD - sorry to say. The techno backgrounds sound like pre-set keyboard samples, the guitar work is uninspired, and overall - the mix of Joe Satriani's guitar with techno dance sounds is awful. I have followed Joe for many years, and honestly believe that this 'effort' to court a new audience is an insult to those who bought his previous releases, and expected a rock-oriented album. Thumbs down."
5,Powerful and Moving,"Many people are hammering this album, but I really can't see why. Every track is obviously Satriani playing electric guitar; only the bass/percussion are synth, which I humbly believe he uses exceptionally well to empower and drive the music.If you love his '95 album, ""Joe Satriani"", and think that's what he should do with his talent, you probably won't like this. If you don't like music full of energy and passion, you probably won't like this. Frankly, that's your loss; this album truly has some of his most powerful and moving compositions. Despite hesitation to buy the album (due to the high volume of negative reviews), I am pleased to announce this is my favorite Satriani album.Matthew 6:33"
3,Joe must be out of ideas.,"I am a Joe Satriani fan since 1987, I bought every single album he released and will buy any he makes in the future as well.But I believe this is his worst album.I might admit some of the solos and tunes not bad, but most of the album sounds like Play Station Game. As a guitar player myself for over 25 years I believe in virtuosity going deeper as you get older and your technical and musical creativity reaches ultimate levels, this album sounds like joe quit guitar playing for a while :-) but I still love the guy, he is one the best guitar players in the world, judging by all other albums."
1,80's techno......,"One thing missing from this album,,,, JOE SATRIANI. Seems as some `80s techo, be-bop, alien has taken over his mind. This album is nothing like his others that show great talent, feeling, style and inspiration in mesmerizing music. What little of that Joe that does come through on a few tracks is still clouded and cluttered with techno background. If you are looking for an instrumental lead guitarist album,,, look elsewhere. But,, if you are looking for pre-programmed `80s techno, you found it in all it's five star rating glory.. It would, however, make a great sound track for a si-fi."
2,The least impressive Joe CD,"I have all of Joe's CD's, and this is the only weak one in the lot. I hope Joe doesn't forget why people buy his records. It's to hear guitar, backed by amazing musicianship.... Not computers. There's no live drums on this disc at all, and that is what hurt this record the most. I hope this doen't mean that Joe has run out of things to try on the guitar. One more record like this, and it could spell disaster for his career, much like when Pat Benatar released that blues record. I know artists don't want to be put in a box, but Joe's box is guitar, not keyboards. Like it or not."
2,IT'S A TECHNO ALBUM WITH SOME GUITAR RIFFS!,It's OK but it's also not a true Satriani album. He's jumped on the techno bandwagon but didn't do the greatest job at it. He's guitar work is complettly drowned out by bass and robotic beat sounds. Couple songs are good...if your into techno. I hate doing it but I was dissapointed in this one!
1,meaningless,"This CD does not deserve to waste time writing about it. Musically, JS is broke and does not have anything to present. Farewell forever."
1,Good Video Game Music at Best,"Disappointed to say the least. I'm a devote Satriani fan but this album sounds like a empty soundtrack for a bad video game. Satriani's trademark is that ALL his music is marked with distinct melody and/or the powerful songwriting. The lack of any ""real"" drums and bass also contributes to the ""emptiness"" you get when you listen to this album. Listen to friend's copy before you lay down the cash. I'm already looking forward to his next album."
3,...hard to digest but still the work of a genius!,"Let's give Joe points for innovation and creativity. No,it's not like his other work but do we really want him to crank outanother mediocre, half-a** version of SURFING WITH THE ALIEN or do we want the guy to try something new. To me, this recording is no better or worse than any other Satriani CD (meaning half the tracks are awesome and half the tracks are simply OK). Just listen to the good tracks and wait for his next release - maybe you'll like it better. Hey, my final word is this: if you're a true Satch fan deep down inside, you should add this one to your collection!"
4,Interesting,"I prefer Jeff Beck's ""Who Else"" album, but really Love the new Michael Schenker electric instrumental album ""Adventures Of The Imagination"" if your looking for great melodic guitar playing check that one out."
2,"Sorry, just not the Joe we know.","Though EOC broke some barriers, all in all it is very lacking. It isn't without it's high points, however, Borg Sex, Until We Say Goodbye, The Power Cosmic 2000 Part 2, and Attack. The drum machine is cool, but this is a line that does not need to be blurred. Folks, save your money and get Crystal Planet or Strange Beautiful Music(I recommend CP)."
2,The worst of the lot,"Joe misses the mark with this one. In fact, this album doesn't compare to his others even remotely. Maybe he thought he was doing what was popular, or maybe he just wanted something different, but, to me, this album sounds like video game audio. If you want some real Joe, buy Surfing With The Alien, Flying In A Blue Dream, The Extremist and/or Is There Love In Space?"
2,Joe Thinks He's Jeff,"Preface: I like a lot of Joe's stuff. 'Crystal Planet' was a great disc. I also like techno.Combining techno with guitar chops isn't new or original. The best example of this, however, is Jeff Beck's 'Who Else!' CD. Joe's style simply doesn't fit into this genre as well as Jeff's does. This Satriani CD just appears to me as a reaction to the direction Jeff Beck is taking his music. The missing piece is the MUSICALITY. Joe is famous for the 'hook', that little guitar-sung chorus you can't get out of your head.You won't find any here. I was disappointed."
1,Brutal,"Not as bad as Steve Vai's latest... but close. At least the total playing time of this comes in under 54 minutes... unlike Vai's almost 70 minute Ultra Zone debacle. I should be the last one to criticize, but if they are THAT bored with guitar playing... DON'T RELEASE GARBAGE LIKE THIS."
3,Hmmmm......,"Being an owner of 5 other Joe Satriani releases, I must say that this one's the most creative. However, sometimes the fact that Satch tries to expand musically means that he'll be adding new things to his repertoire. He basically throws out live drumming and replaces it with an electronic-based percussion system. It doesn't sound too bad, but I'm sure most loyal listeners are used to the throbbing yet extremely rhythmic drums. His guitar works continues to strive - he continues to amaze me with the numerous styles he can do."
4,One of my favorite Satch discs,"Note that all except one of the one-star reviews for this CD were posted in the 3-4 month period following its release in 2000. I think this CD caught a lot of people off guard, and yes, perhaps the use of electronic drums and the various attempts at making ""electronica"" sounds via the guitar may have been a bit misguided. And imo the drums could have been done much better. But, from a musical standpoint, the material here is very strong.The songs Until We Say Goodbye (which is the one song here that DOES have acoustic drums, performed superbly by the great drummer Anton Figg) and Clouds Race Across the Sky deserve a spot on any Satriani greatest songs list, and the remaining tracks are all good to very good. ""Attack"" is probably the only real misfire here, but even it is listenable."
2,Joe made a mistake,"yes, it's true. Joe made a mistake with this album. The songs are poorly written and the drum machine sounds downright awful. I love Joe's other music, but this is different. I still respect him, there are many amazing solos on here, but if you want to hear Satch at his best, Surfing with the Alien and Flying in a Blue Dream will always be there."
5,"Folks, it's a concept album","Joe's always been about creating vast alien soundscapes. Engines of Creation is also the title of a pioneering book about nanotechnology, and when I discovered this, the CD made a lot more sense. Imagine a future where submicroscopic bots can create unimaginably complex molecular structures, or course through our bodies fighting disease. Organic life and technology will fuse in unimaginable ways, and the songs on Engines of Creation, for me anyway, are an amazing soundtrack to speculation. Like most Satch, it's not love at first listen, but by the 3rd or 4th spin you'll never get it out of your CD player. Or your head."
3,pass the noodles,"satriani's biggest problem, and one that he has in common with any number of guitar gods, is avoiding endless, pointless noodling and the formless tunes that leads to. he doesn't succeed too often here, but he does get some interesting tones and effects. that said, the opening cut ""devil's slide"" is wild mayhem that rocks, the final track ""engines of creation"" really grabs the guts, and the melodic ""until we say goodbye"" is wonderful. ironically though, last generation's god jeff beck outdoes him for interesting tones and focused playing on another electronica experiment, You Had It Coming."
3,"Not bad, but a definite change in style","I have to agree with many of the other reviewers that this CD marks a strong, but perhaps unwelcome, change in Satriani's style. Some songs are good, but there is way too much electronic programming. Satriani excels in his ability to play guitar (and many other instruments for that matter), and he should focus on that rather than computer/electronic gadgetry. I hope this trend does not continue, or it will be the last Satriani CD that I purchase. I'll stick to ""Crystal Planet"", ""Joe Satriani"", and of course ""Surfing with the Alien""."
3,Just listen to the guitar,"Guys, if you focus only on the guitar you will realize that it's the same Satch that we know and love. However, I am no fan of the drum beat and therefore this album could have been a lot better had he used a drummer that you can put in liner notes. Note: the songs are awesome though if you tune out the drum machine"
4,131 Christians AND Religous people,"Good summaries of the people in this book. Just be aware 10-25% of the people in this book could more appropriately be labeled religious as opposed to Christian. Examples include Harry Fosdick, Menno Simons, Aimee McPherson, Catherine of Siena, Teresa of Avila and others."
4,Nice little biographies - maybe a bit too short.,This is a nice book to pick and read and then set aside. It does encourage one's curiosity to know more about many of these people.
2,Over half are Protestants?,How is it possible that over half of the 131 Christians in the book come from a division of Christianity that has only existed for a few hundred years and in areas that represent only a minority of Christian-dominated regions? Where are the great names from the Eastern Churches? An embarrassing display of the typical Protestant blindness regarding history.
5,One of my Favorites,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Truly entertaining and the fact that it is based on Tom Sullivan's real life, just makes it all the more priceless. Until they release this on DVD, I treat my VHS copy like gold!"
1,one word- AWFUL!,"I'm a huge Billy Joel fan & read someone's comments that this was good, so I ordered it- it was absolutely awful. I listened to it once & will never listen to it again. I can't imagine anyone liking it."
1,Just listen to the samples,"This is such a disgrace. These songs do not have the emotional impact without the words, especially when played by a mediocre pianist with new age sensibilities and indulging in pretentious techniques even a beginning piano student can accomplish. This is Muzak. Nothing more."
2,Poor Quality Product,This is a real poor quality product. Its so light and thin that it can be bent with one hand. A complete waste of money. do not buy.
5,How well do you remember your last vacation?,"How well do you remember your last vacation? Or a great meal? What do you do to record the beauty around you? Do you notice the horrors of everyday life to which so many people are oblivious? Ms. Jernigan was a consumate story teller. Her stories are not of the obvious, but of the things most of us overlook, ignore and wish we could remember. Absorb this book and you'll never take a trip again without thinking of her work. This book is a true delight. The visual content is wonderful, the text informative and reserved, and the book's design and construction is almost as unique as the subject matter. If you are an artist, traveller - if you are alive - this book should be in you library. More importantly, in you life."
2,Evidence: The Art of Candy Jernigan,I waited years to get this book and it was not like the review. It was more like a travel journal then her art work. Would like to see more of her art work. Was not worth the wait.
4,All of William H. Millers Books are good.,"William H. Miller is a great Cruise ship History writer. I own 3 of his books and they are good. And I think this one is as good as them. especially the one he did the book when he wrote about it. about the book, Talks about the history of ocean liner passenger ships. and pictures of special cruise ships like the bedrooms, lounges, the dining rooms and some special rooms. If you like william H. Millers books like I do You're gonna like this one. I guaranty you."
3,They are just 'ok'.,"The only reason I bought these filter pads was because I also ordered the Fluval Fx5 at the same time and well, I was feeling lazy.All these are a blue 'coarse' Filter pads pre-cut into circles that are fitted for the Fx5. Save some money and just buy the Coarse filter pads from Petco or Petsmart and cut them yourself, Unless you feel like being lazy like I did. lolBut for what they are and the price they are they aren't worth it."
3,Great cd for the circuit boy in all of us...(some of us),This cd had me thinking back to all of the circuit parties from last year. It's great to try to remember all of the great times through these songs...
5,A boy of old Prague,"A boy of old Prague is set in the sixteenth century in Prague. The story is told by Tomas, a Gentile boy, who is bonded to a old man who is Jewish. There is alot of injustice and predjudice practiced against the Jews of Prague, who are restricted to a ghetto. Tomas - from a poor farming family, discovers that what is said about the Jewish people are not true and is witness to terrible actions carried out against the people living in the ghetto by the Gentiles. The illustrations by Ben Shahn are dark and brooding. Read it if you can find it!"
1,This SUCKS!!!,This movie sucked from start to finish!!Wouldn't recommend it to ANYONE!!!!Purchase the real thing!!Horrible story and acting!!
2,No esta completo,"Este software no hace etiquetas para el disco o el cd solo para el estuche de estos.No me parece un buen producto. No lo recomiendo. Hay un sola etiqueta brillante y las demas son mate.Aunque trae las etiquetas para pegar en los cd , el sotfware no tiene la opcion para realizar estas etiquetas"
1,Unbelievable!,"When I was a kid, we made flowers out of regular ole tissues! All we needed was three kleenex and a scissors and a stapler. In fact, I had just taught my nieces how to do this and it cost a WHOLE lot less than this kit does."
5,Gentle And Convincing Book On Morality and Spirituality,"Want to move Godward? Mark O'Keefe's book will surely help you in your Godward movement. Most of Christian's life journey is both moral and spiritual. These two realities are simply inextricably intertwined. Mark O'Keefe in this book simply did that. Drawing from his knowledge of the Judaeo-Christian Tradition, he gives us a good guide to indeed move Godward. Read this book and we will surely see each other in Heaven."
3,Catcher in the Rye for the new millenium,"Dark, disturbing, but engaging till about half way in. After that, I found myself losing patience with the main character, Luke. It's hard to stay engaged in a story with a character that inspires very little sympathy.*spoiler alert below*He gets his sometimes-girlfriend pregant not once but twice (forcing her to have an abortion the first time), accidentally kills a kitten, and helps his little brother get addicted to heroin. After the midway point in the book, I just couldn't shake the feeling that the book became a contrived experiment in Dark Literature. Having finished the book by skimmed the last 1/3 or so (Luke's self important musings get old by then), I am left with a nasty aftertaste in my mouth. Somehow the author tricked me into wasting hours of my life on a book that took me down violent paths full of not-even-very-inventive gratuitous casual sex. I think the author has some raw talent but has a lot of maturing to do himself."
1,The Very First Thaksgiving Day,"This book is beautifully illustrated. I bought this book for my 4 year old granddaughter. The story ryhme is repeated on each page and became boring and left us wanting to know more about the pictures, the pilgrim girl and her new Indian friend. I read the customer reviews and was persuaded by them to purchase this book. It was a big disappointment and left us wanting more."
3,"It's no Bullworker, and that is the problem","This is a beginner's product. Not to knock it or anything, but a Bullworker, while more expensive, is a much better product.No, I am not an agent of their company, just a soldier who has both and found only the Bullworker actually useful."
3,Not as good as you think they are...,"Maybe it's the brand vs. the old school but these taste like left over caramel and sugar. Don't waste your time, buy something of higher quality or else they'll be left sitting."
2,Why buy this one?,"I have a Sony Bravia 46"" ...This Extended Service Plan covers TVs costing up to $1,999 and costs $279 for 4 years.But Sony itself will sell you a Plan for TVs costing up to $2,500 for $199 for 4 years, or $259 for 5 years.Am I missing something?"
2,Poor Customer Service,"I purchased this when I bought a Samsung LNS4692D. After 13 months my tv died. At first NEW was very helpful and I felt comfortable. After a MONTH AND A HALF of the service company (NEVER USE A to Z Electronics in Austin) spinning their wheels NOT fixing my tv, NEW reps turned on me. It then took ANOTHER 2 weeks of wrangling with NEW and the service company before NEW agreed to pay for a replacement tv.All told, 2 months without a tv and I - the paying customer - did all of the work. I did give 2 stars as they finally paid for a replacement, but damn, what a horrible experience.It's because of this that I won't be making any more large purchases on Amazon that require an extended warranty but only NEW is offered."
3,Great Customer Service,"I give it 3 stars because I did not use them for the service plan. I bought this plan and returned the TV, so I needed to get a credit for the plan. If you cancel the service plan their CSR will tell you that it takes 8 weeks to process your return. This is because they do not know how long it will take your credit card company to post the credit to your account. I used amex, and after I contacted New to cancel my service plan I had a credit on my card for the amount I paid in about 5 business days."
3,Haven't Had to Use Yet (Knock on Wood),"I haven't had to use this yet, so I'm starting to think it was a waste of money. I haven't heard too many of my friends with similar HDTVs (40"", Samsung, 720p) having any problems. I was just worried at the time of purchase. If I had to do it again I wouldn't purchase this service plan...however I still have 31 months left, so we'll see."
3,Little Wary about this Warranty.,Basically all I got was a document in the mail describing their warranty services but NOT describing what I myself had purchased.Others have commented that they were not happy with this service...but it was the only one available so I gave it a try.Have not used the service yet...so cannot tell you...
1,You just lost a sale,"Not available in Maine? Are you crazy? Since when is Maine as isolated as the US Virgin Islands...or, get this...GUAM?!?Boo Amazon - great deal for the television, but no service guarantee. I'm ashamed. I guess I'll have to buy at my local Circuit City, Best Buy, or Tweeter...they're all available in Maine."
5,Hope to never use this,"Since this is a service plan and my new tv covered by it has not yet failed, I can only base my assessment on the promptness of the delivery. I received what I believe to be the necessary documentation for this plan promptly."
3,Easy to contact,"When I bought this plan they said they would cover, normal wear and tear, such as replacing bulbs. So I bought it thinking I would probably get my money through having them replace bulb. Sense they cost $200 each. But when my bulb blew out after a 1yr and 1/2. They said they don't cover it. But it was easy to contact everyone and If there was a major problem I'm sure they would fix it no questions asked."
1,Who really knows until it's too late...,"This warranty is purchased through Amazon, but it is actually distributed by another company. When you search for TV warranties on Amazon, you will see 4 warranties that appear to be the same, but are different prices. I called the company that sells these warranties and asked what the difference was. They told me that there is no difference between the $119 warranty and the $499 warranty; they cover the exact same thing. The girl I spoke with even asked her manager and he said there is no difference. Warranties are a tricky item to review, because it all looks good until you actually need it. So, on this one, I suppose only time will tell. The one difference between the Amazon warranty and the electronic store warranty is that the Amazon one will not replace the first bulb in the TV; but I figure if I need to replace the bulb within those four years I will still be saving $100 because I can get a new bulb for around $200."
1,Not Worth It - but I should have known better,"This review is applicable to all service plans. These are generally not worth the price. To do some relevant math, take the cost of the extra warranty and divide it my the sale price of the item the warranty covers. That number is the minimum chances you would need for the item you own to break during the warranty period before the price would be justified. Generally, it won't be a reasonable probability, and the cost would be better spent to buy a more reliable brand or save in case the item does go bad.If you absolutely need the insurance plan, then sure, but these things are usually designed to cost way more than their actual value (says the insurance guy).Now if only I'd listened to my own logic before I bought this..."
2,repaired items warranty is only 30 days & coverage overlaps the manufacturer's warranty,hope I didn't buy two extra years past the manufacturer's warranty for a 4 year price!!!11-27-11 JUST FOUND OUT THE PART THEY REPAIRED 10 MONTHS AGO HAS FAILED AND THEY ONLY WARRANTY THE PART FOR ONE MONTH.
1,2yr service agreement,I have had the TV for 1 month and still have not recieved the 2yr plan info on mail.
1,Extended warranties are generally a poor value,These types of plans do not generally pay for themselves; it is far better to pay with a credit card that extends the makers warranty for free.
4,"continues where ""the boy who couldn't stop washing"" left off","For the person who suffers from the anguish of panic, horrific images, anxiety attacks, obsessive - compulsive ideation, and uncontrollable fear, here is a book which not only presents a sensitive perspective on these highly disruptive personal problems, which complicate our daily lives, here also is a ""help"" the sufferer can use without being only dependent on medication only, or many, namy expensive hours in a theraphists office. Raeann's insightful presentations and worksheets, help people to identify specific ""triggers"" that set them off, then using several different methods learn how to manage the fear, panic and anxiety those ""triggers"" produce. As a lifelong sufferer of Anxierty, Panic and Obsessive - Compulsive Disorder, here for the first time is a book which truely talks to the sufferer. I can't recoment this book highly enough"
5,Sensitive book on anxiety problems,"This book is an extremely well written book on the problems that people have with phobias, panic and obsessive-compulsive disorder. When I first was diagnosed with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, I read all of the books I could find on the subject. This is one of the best ones I found. It offers insight into the situations that sufferers of anxiety disorders go through."
4,Great!,"I enjoyed all of the stories of others suffering from OCD. Most are extreme cases, but overall I could relate to the fear, etc. It was nice to know there are others with the same problem."
4,One of the best,"I can't give full 5 stars, as i'm rating the whole book.The best part of the book comes towards the end, page 229 onwards. The preceeding chapters are typical items one can find in all OCD books.If I were to rate only those towards the end, dealing with how to get better,I'll simply rate this book 6 out of 5 stars."
5,I love my grinder,This grinder works great I absolutely have no complaints at all! I would recommend this to anyone! It's so easy to use and easy to clean good for a beginner or advanced person.
1,Defective,"Upon removing the item from it's box, I noticed a rattling from within the housing of the grinder. I said to myself, ""this can't be good"". Upon closer inspection, I saw that one of the fan blades had broken off and was loose inside the unit. Very disappointing since I was hoping to do some stained glass grinding this weekend. I even paid extra for shipping to get it sooner! HECHO EN MEXICO = Made in China or at least that's been my experience. How a glaring defect like that made it through quality control, I will never know."
1,Trash,"Like all the new Star Wars books and movies that are comming out -- it's all joined foces with every Clech'e that's ever existed in the Science fiction realm. It's all canned. It's all fake. It's all predictable, and I can't believe George Lukas allowed his series to be so terribly brutalized. Star Wars sucks now."
4,This Book was VERY Good!!!!!!,"This book was very good. I could read it over and over and over again. I like how the book gives more detail than the movie. I like the first two chapters about Anikin his planet. It gives you more information about him and where he comes from. I think that Brooks did a very good job in making it like the movie, but giving you more information than the movie. He did a wonderful job on the book."
3,Good story,"I enjoyed the story very much. However, I doubt if I would have enjoyed it as much if I didn't know that I movie full of great special effects was coming out soon. It was easy to place the spots in the trailers with the parts of the book."
3,Fair to middlin,"I gave this 3 stars cuz I am a star wars fan, not because this was particularly good... It wasnt that it was bad either, it was just an almost verbatim transcript of the movie... I will try the others, but if they are like this I will stop after CLones..."
3,Infinetly better than the movie,"I, like many, was not a huge fan of the movie version of this - especially when compared to Episodes IV-VI. However, I thought this book was pretty good - certainly better than the movie. In particular, this book (in combination with the books to Episodes II and III), I was able to better follow the interactions and relationships between the Trade Federation, the Senate, the Empire, and the Rebellion, which I had found confusing the first time I watched the movie (although it made more sense with another few viewings). The characters feel more developed in this book than they did in the movie, and it fit in better with the Star Wars universe, in my opinion. I hadn't had a chance to read Sci-Fi in several years (because of school), and this book reminded me how much I like the genre (and I've gone on a Sci-Fi/Fantasy) binge since. Definitely worth reading, particularly if you dislike the movie version, or you want to fill in the gaps that the movies don't fill."
5,I love Star Wars...,"I love Star Wars, and couldn't wait for this title to come out. I bought it in Boulder at the Star Wars fan fest, and then I ordered the Anakin cover from Amazon. This book had a slightly different feel to it. I saw Terry Brooks speak about it, and about his writing experiences in general, at the same fan event in Colorado. Evidently he knew little or nothing about all the rest of the Star Wars books prior to writing this one, which would account for his unique feel. I liked the movie and the book, but the Thrawn novels are probably still my favorite of the books."
