5,Love LLM books!,I have read many of Linda Lael Miller's books and it doesn't matter the time period you are transported there. Great read.
4,Good Story,"This was a very good story. My only complaint was that it needed fleshing out. It would have made a great basis for a real romance novel (I don't consider these little books real novels). I think she needed to have further developed a story line of Liam's aunt trying to take him and the McKettricks banding together. If she wasn't going to make any use of that storyline, she never should have started it. I liked Hannah and Doss better as a couple than Sierra and Travis."
4,Linda Lael Miller devotee,"Anyone who loves Linda Lael Miller's books will enjoy this one! If you are a fan of her McKettrick Family series, it is a must read to help you fill in the missing pieces in this series. I special ordered this book and it was well worth it!"
5,A Wonderful Story to Read,"Linda Lael Miller has a way with words and when she wrote the McKetttrick series and included Sierra's Homecoming, it just tied the whole family together. I enjoyed reading the book immensely and look forward to more from this series if she is willing to continue with it. It is a very vivid adaptation of life on the ranch from the 1800's to present. I recommend this author and the series to anyone who likes western style romance. I never did until I read these books."
4,Sweet Book,"This was a sweet book with likeable characters. It was, however, much too short. It should have been expanded upon and made into a full length novel."
4,Best Startup book I've read so far,"This book is a nice collection of practical, how-to advice with little hype. It does a good job of giving you a good road map. Emphasising ""unfair advantage"" coming out in the business plan - amazing how many I've read that don't ever mention why they have an unfair advantage! Only downside is the price - a good one to check out at the library!"
4,Te main content not updated much since the last edition,"It is a very good book for anyone interested about high tech startup. However, I found that the main content, especially the case studies, have not been updated much since the last edition. The only change seems to be the tables outlining the growth of valuation of Yahoo and Netscape. There must be something more to add to the book about them and other successful internet startups."
2,B.A.D.,"I was very excited to read this book as it received such good reviews from others, but I have been nothing but disappointed. The guidance is trite, the wording uncomfortable, the list of his personal accomplishments in the ""white hot spotlight"" of Silicon Valley a bit nauseating. Glad to know that Nesheim anticipated that the internet would be big waaaaay back in 1997. Try Crossing the Chasm or Managing the Tornado by Moore"
1,Avoid this seller,"Worst seller ever, item not the same as the picture and not notice buyer before shipping."
3,it was ok! not bad,Condition of the book was a little worse than I expected. But then again it was a used book that I ordered. No other issues against the seller.
5,"Excellent condition, fast shipping",Thank you for the textbook received in a timely manner and in excellent condition .
5,Music to melt by...,"Ms. Scott at her finest. This album is rich in feeling and emotion. Her unique style and presentation will make you melt. All her albums are 4 star or better but this one and her previous Japanese import only on SINDROME records are her two best. This is an essential to add to any good jazz collection. Her smoky, seductive voice will capture your heart and soul...not to mention, it will make you SMILE."
4,Good instructions. May be worth it...,"As a whole set it's good. The instructions are very good and you feel like the teacher is right there with you. There is just the disappointments of having the same introduction in all three volumes that take up ten minutes and another ten minutes at the end with the same set of advertisements. This leaves only 30 minutes on average for instructions. I wish I could have purchased it at a lower price, but now that I have the set, I will keep it. It may be worth it. It's good to have a little extra instruction, but it's nothing compared to going to the dojo."
2,Lovely voice; boring presentation and collection.,"This CD was quite a disappointment to me after seeing Katie McMahon in Riverdance. In playing this album for some friends, I found them quickly turning away from the music. Generally we agreed that it was nicely sung, uninvolved, and quite boring. Sort of ""wallpaper"" Irish/Celtic music."
3,Good but a lot of static,"We got this for a 12 month old. It is very small. It's only about 2.5 by 3.5 inches. Great for the little ones. It's been dropped a few times already and has not broken. The only thing we don't really like about it is how much static there is. It always has static, no matter how far out the antenna is. This doesn't seem to matter to the 12 month old though. It's easy to use - just push a button to switch through stations."
4,good little radio for child,"the radio is smaller then i expected. about the size of my palm. but i guess it's easy to carry in your purse or diaper bag. the volume does go really loud and the reception is pretty good. cute toy for toddler or young child. bought it for my 18 month old and she loves it. she likes to carry it with her eveywhere she goes and dances to the music, lol."
5,Time Well Spent,"Reading this book was time well spent! I liked the juxtaposition of the late Victorian era and 15th century Scotland. I particularly loved the reaction of the Victorian era Laird of Dunraven to the heroine's experiences. It wasn't what I was expecting, but it made perfect sense. The hero and heroine were appealing and the author set up the resolution well. I'm looking forward to reading Ms. Kirkwood's other books."
5,It Will Capture You,"This was one of the best stories I've read in a really long time. It has humor, adventure, love, ant lots more. It's very hard to put down a story like this that keeps you laughing and crying and hoping for the best outcome. Definately must read."
3,Entertaining!!,I found this book very entertaining. It was my first time-travel book and I enjoyed it. I just find that the couple fell for each other too fast and too hard.
5,Fun Read,I really liked the story. It was a fun read. I found the bad guys a little predictable but taken as a light-hearted read it's a fun story that keeps your interest.
5,A Slip in Time,"Sweet reading, very different from what I usually read. Going to look for more of Kathleen Kirkwood books. This is a good read for anyone who likes romance."
5,Excellent movie about families going through divorces,"Excellent movie about families going through divorces. Very funny, but it is also stirs your emotions."
2,"Janeane is great, the rest grates...","As many other reviewers have noted, the scene with Janeane Garofalo and Randy Quaid is hilarious. The rest is a waste of time. Go to the chapter with Janeane, and you'll be alright..."
5,Great movie. Fast shipping,Thanks for getting the movie here fast. Lots of great stars. Good movie just like I remembered.
4,Very good overall,"As I stated in title, this is very good overall. It's a bit 80's-dated and has some cheesy stuff, but very funny as a whole. Also, I think it's a very good movie that sends couples a message about how important it is to stay together for kids sake and how messy life is after divorce. Not an Academy award-winning film, but I think you'll enjoy it."
4,"Fun, Touching, Love Randy Quaid and Jeanine G.","So glad this movie is out on DVD - it's got all the little warm fuzzies, funnies and poignancy that I love about a movie. Randy Quaid and Jeanine Garafalo are great..they are so funny together! This is definitely a cute movie that I'll enjoy watching over and over again."
5,"bye, bye love review",Such a good cheese family drama. Pull out the ben and jerry's and have a girls night with this one!!!
1,Still can't figure out how I bought this book...,"Don't waste your money, your time or your energy.Nice story, I suppose, but just cotton candy. And artificially sweetened at that.I still can't figure out why I bought this book."
5,as described and more,"Firstly, I ordered from racokbooks. Now about the actual product. Simply put, I received the item as described. The coin is circulated but retains many nice details. A beautifully designed coin that deserves a place in every coin collection. The seller graded the coin accurately, and I am glad I got what was described. I even got a couple of extra coins. I am very satisfied with my purchase."
5,A found gem!!!!!,"I have been looking for this CD for ages ever since I heard at a friends a few years back. This is an EXTREMELY hard CD to find but it is an absolute must have. RED features beautiful performances by Boney James, Lenny Castro, Buzzy Fieten and so many more. Each song is just so melodic and beautiful. Wonderful production. Kiki's voice is soothing and emotional. Songs favorites include My Desire, Candles, I Won't Wait and Cool Water. Get this CD! you won't be sorry."
3,It's okay but not organized per my liking.,"This is primarily organized by county which I find difficult to digest. For example, if I want to know about a decent hotel or restaurant in the Valley, I also have to know what county I'm in."
5,Beautiful voice as always!,"Always top notch singing from Anita! Whether it is in Cantonese,Japanese,or in this case,Mandarin.Anita always made sure she gave her best!The music overall,is excellent!I recommend this one."
2,Disappointing,"The idea is a good one, but the execution is not quite right. The problem is that the blunders are nicely highlighted, drawing attention right to them. The corrections should be right next to the blunders, enabling the reader to immediately see the difference. Instead, the corrections are included in plain text, after, or interspersed with, the explanation. The result is that the incorrect version is actually more memorable than the correct version. Too bad, because otherwise this is a good list of common mistakes and their corrections."
2,good but needs improvement,"A good light review of the different areas of the italian language for first or second year italian students with an emphasis on common mistakes. Unfortunately, I agree with another reviewer that the format of the book with green boxes identifying the blunder but with no correct version next to it was a constant distraction. In fact, it became so annoying I had to ignore/skip the green boxes. Be careful, this book doesn't aim to teach you every area, e.g. subjunctive, and rightly so. If you don't already grasp the concept, you will probably be left begging for more and some examples may not instantly make sense. It is helpful that the book is heavily divided into small sections."
4,Correct Blunders,"Correct your Italian Blunders is a good, but not great, book. I am a second semester Italian student and I have made some use of this book in my studies. The book has clarified some questions that I have had. It is well organized, inexpensive and fairly clear. It would be even better if it had a CD that demonstrated some of the pronunciation problems and included listening comprehension exercises."
5,Holy Handgrenade,It was a gift for my sister. She loved it. The educational value field doesn't apply here as it was an addult fun gift.
5,Strat pickguard,"Absolutely perfect. Some other reviewer complained about theirs being blemished, but I'm guessing they just didn;t know to pull off the protective layer. Mine was shiny-new, and was an absolute perfect fit on my Mexi-Strat. The price was the best,anywhere,and with free shipping, I couldn't be happier."
5,It's a great Fender product,"Excellent product. 5 ply pickguard is neatly constructed, no rough edges, and is nice and shiny. Great replacement, with 11 holes fits an Am Std Strat perfectly."
2,Dissatisfied,"I bought a deluxe players strat, and wanted to change the look of it a bit so I bought this pickguard. It fits fine, but it definitely doesn't look new. When I recieved this pickguard, it was scuffed and scratched straight out of the package. I've kept it on my guitar because I can't afford to get a different product that might have some quality control involved in its production, but I would definitely not purchase one of these again."
1,Was so so.,Bought this a while back just got around to installing it on my mexi strat. Doesn't fit perfect. Kinda bummed but oh well
4,Easy to Install looks stylish,"Easy to install and looks stylish - numerous hooks so that you can have a place for every person or accessory. It wasn't in a place where I could screw it into the studs, but it comes with wall anchors. Because it's only got the two screw points I'm kind of concerned if it gets full of heavy winter coats, but for now with our hoodies and fleece and my purse it's holding like a champ.Possible packaging issue - the baggie holding the screws was sliced open in transit somehow and the screws were loose in the box. I'm lucky I found them all."
2,An Okay Book But Definitely Not Among Leuci's Best,"The story manages to hold your interest and the characters are okay, yet Leuci's individual elements do not really come together to bring about a highly engrossing book. If you like police stories, try Leuci's The Snitch and Captain Butterfly."
3,Not her best,"Rhonda is good at this old timey country and I do like this, but it doesn't compare to ""Written In The Stars"" For me which was done on Giant records too. Could be the sound quality, got it on one of those FYE mix and burn, just doesn't have that great of sound quality."
5,Brown & Roach Could Do No Wrong:,"The Clifford Brown / Max Roach Quartett could do no wrong; all of their works together gave one the impression of a perfect match, each one with so much talent; they enhanced each other. By the time this album was released, it was like they had been together forever, and you could not wait to hear what else they were going to do. Basin Street, in it's relaxed form, brings out the basic quality of the whole group, with Brown & Roach at their best."
5,Panorama Function DOES Work with Other Brands,"I own three different brands of flash (Olympus, SanDisk, and Viking). All three of them utilize the panaromic feature.Currently, the Viking and SanDisk card are priced exactly the same--which is a lot less expensive than this Olympus card."
3,058-9167158-97396656),"I NEED TO KNOW THE STATUS OF MY ORDER AND IF THE ORDERSHIPPED BY ""UPS"" OR ""USPS"" AND THE ""NUMBER TRACKING"" OF THIS ORDER.(058-9167158-97396656)STAR MEDIA CARDS 32MBTHANKS:JOSE M. RIVERA"
2,Great if you own a supermarket,"One for Fogelberg ompletists only, I think. The instrumental stuff really is just muzak, and pretty pointless. Dan does quite a nice job of some of the sixties songs - if he got rid of the flute and the electronic drums, there could be quite a nice album of covers in it for him. No resemblance whatsoever to a great album. Sorry."
2,please release night rider album!,actually i think this album is mediocre and i am writing this only to plead for whoever is in charge to release tim's outstanding night rider album on cd.
4,2nd collaboration between Dan and Tim,This album is about +-18years later still great but not as good as the 1st Collaboration Twin Sons. However these two albums are my defintely favorite Dan Fogelberg and Tim Weisberg albums ever.
4,Good Overall Game Examples For Any Language,"This book goes through the details of many types of games, from card games to rpgs. These examples are good no matter what language you wish to program in. So if you are looking for game ideas, then this might be a good place to look. It comes with code for each game/example, and visual basic is easy to follow along with. They go into detail and explain all the code that they show you, which gives you good insight into some of the framework and details you need to think about before programming any game. I did not give this 5 stars because, if you are a knowledgable vb (or any language) programmer, then you could probably put these games together on your own without this book. Visual Basic is not a great language for programming games, but the simplicity of the language makes it simple to learn the basics of design and framework"
3,Good for beginners but very little DirectX,"If you have never programmed simple games before and you are interested in learning how to do so, then this book does a fairly good job of giving an introduction into the field. However, anyone with even a small amount of game programming experience will get little from this book. The samples are easy to understand but few of the games would even be worthy of ""Shareware"" status. Most disappointing was the lack of DirectX coverage (only a few pages worth). DirectX is a great way to expand the capablities of Visual Basic, and any intermediate (or above) game programmer will want to utilize DirectX 8.0 in their lattest projects."
1,Buy If You Want To Make Solitaire,"I hoped that this book would have tips on creating mainstream type games in Visual Basic. Instead, this is a whole book dedicated to programming card games. It's nice to know how to program your own solitaire, but the authors almost totally disregarded the fact that DirectX 7 and 8 are both fully supported in Visual Basic. Of course, there is a very short appendix for DirectX, but even that can't satify the desires of VB game programmers who want to make games like Metroid, or Quake. There are many books that deal with C++ game programming in DirectX, but there are NO Visual Basic books that deal with it. So people who want to learn how to create games in DirectX will be wasting their money on this. If you want to learn how to program games in Visual Basic in DirectX, use Internet tutorials, as that's all there still is."
2,Not great for good games,"This book shows you the basics for producing very cheesy freeware games. The only real thing I got out of it, is that I should have purchased a more in depth book. If you are just starting out in VB then perhaps this is for you, like I said it covers a few of the basics."
3,A good book to get the juices flowing,"This book is aimed purely at beginners. It doesn't really teach game programming thru 20+ chapters of indepth topics, but instead it teaches via actual games created in MSVB. The writting style is very simple to understand and most of the code works straight off of the pages (not common). If you are new to the scene of game programming or want to get some creative juices flowing to get started on your first game, this book is definately for you."
3,Good Beginner's Book and that is it.,"If it is your first time programming anything in VB, this book is for you. The code is too easy follow. The farthest it goes is the VB standard toolbar. It dabs in directsound and API & DX are in the appendix. The author doesn't think too highly of VB's potential from gaming. Although, I do think this book would strengthen a beginner's understanding of VB6."
4,I made Pong with what i learned in this book!!,"This is a great book, an easy read, and an excellent start for the VB programmer interested in the basics of video game design. It doesn't touch DirectX, or anything 3d for that matter, but it will give you an idea of what a game is about where the coding is concerned.If you are interested in making the next Quake, this book is not for you. If you are interested in making the next EverQuest, this book is not for you. If you are interested in seeing how basic windows games are made, how video games were written before DirectX, or if you just want to see some alternate styles of Visual Basic programming, this is one cool book."
4,good basic sand set,I bought this sand set for my daughter because I liked that it was PVC-free. It is also very well made and the colors make it very cute for a little girl.
5,Sweet Pink Sand Play Set - Perfect for the little lady,Purchased this for my 3yr old niece who absolutely loved it. She went for the watering can right away and is now a big help to her mom in the garden.
1,18 months,Worked fine as our desktop monitor then at 18 months colors went haywire. Olevia customer support suspects it's a bad main board which costs almost as much as a new monitor. Will pay a little more for reliability next time. Cannot recommend.
4,Great TV For Price..Low Volume Buzzing has a Fix,Great tv for the money. Low volume buzz some complain about can be cured by changing the backlight (I emailed a company tech complaining about the problem). Remote keeps me from rating 5 starts as its very basic & has no sleep timer option which stinks if this going to be a bedroom tv.
4,Great TV for the price...,"Considering it's price, it's worth it. It's so much easier to move this TV around versus getting a big regular TV. The quality of DVD's are great. However, the TV isn't the best if you don't have HD convertor box. I don't know if that's the reason but the picture is good but lets say a quality between VCR and DVD, a little closer to VCR than DVD. However, a great price, I can hook my laptop up to it. It has dual input. It does not have PIP where you can surf channels on the same input, only works with 2 different inputs. Which is good if I'm watching DVD because I can see whose at the door but not so good if I'm watching tv, I need to change to the right channel to see whose there. I would recommend purchasing a surround sound system, get the Logitech 1000w (500w RMS) system, its about $250 on here, you will need an adapter, but it is a great surround sound system, equilavent to my fathers 2k bose system."
2,I wanted to like this TV,"it was a great price at the time and it works perfectly in the master bedroom...where it gets about 45 mintues of use a day in the morning...and occassionally when I am in bed sick or playing insomnia boy. I have not had too many issues, but there are two major problems...the hum from the speakers is unreal, especially when the volume is turned down. The second issue is that the remote stopped working. It just stopped. I have changed the batteries twice and still nothing. The bad part is, I cannot find ANY universal remotes that will work with it. If anyone knows one that will...post it please! For the price of LCD TV's today, look to one of the major brands...it is not worth the hassle unless you need a cheap TV."
4,"Great movie/HT screen, comes with many features. not a great TV for analog cable programing","Splended for HT,DVD,VHS experience ..... Cheap but comprehensive remote with flimsy buttons .... great native resolution but no built-in HD tuner... might have to do a little adjustments to get a better reception for the regular Cable TV previewing...Overall, greatest bang for the buck in its class. Highly recommended .... If you can't afford the Sharp Aqous models."
3,Syntax Olevia LT 27 INCH FLAT PANEL LCD TV,"FOR THE MONEY ITS NOT A BAD TV ITS JUST NOT AS GOOD AS THE NAME BRANDS, LIKE SONY , PHILIPS, SANYO OR TOSHIBA . THE SOUND SYSTEM IS POOR & THE PICTURE IS FUZZY AT BEST ON CABLE .WHEN DVDS ARE PLAYED THE PICTURE IS CLEAR. FORGET GETTING THE $100 DOLLAR MAIL in REBATE!! I MAILED IN THE SALES SLIP AND THE UPC CODE ON THE SHIPPING BOX 3 TIMES I FOLLOWED THE DIRECTIONS TO THE LETTER & AFTER 2 MONTS I GAVE UP ON IT !! DO YOURSELF A FAVOR IF YOU BUY THIS TV MAKE SURE YOU TAKE OUT A SERVICE CONTRACT, MY SOUND CIRCUIT BOARD HAD TO BE REPLACED TWICE IN 9 MONTHS THIS TV IS OK FOR A SECOND SET."
1,Screen busted within 18 months - TV is now totally useless,"I bought the Olevia 30"" through Amazon back in March 2005 (at a cost of $1150 plus delivery at the time) ... a few days ago - Saturday July 29 2006, the screen suddenly went black and the TV died - the sound still worked but no vision. I had a TV expert friend look at it yesterday - and he said that it has gone for good ...Lasted less than 18 months --- so much for the 12 month warranty.My recommendation - stay away from Ovelia ... majorly disappointed - and have to falk out $800 for a replacement ...."
1,Poor tv Poor Service,All right it was cheap. But before you buy try getting through to their customer service line (1-888-syntax8). It is virtually impossible. Then try to listen to the tv in a low noise enviroment. There is a terrible hum when the volume is turned down (Syntax says this is typical). Then take a good look at the remote control. It is basic as one can get. No program functions no other device control. Then look at the universal remotes in the stores and see if you can find one to control it. This tv and organization is more trouble than it is worth even at a cheap price.(...)I wrote the atty general about that.
4,It Works For Me,"Let me start out by saying, I'm a middle-aged woman who has given birth to two children. I'm in decent shape physically, do 2-3 miles per day, eat a low-calorie/low fat diet, and do extended sessions on this machine (almost) every day.It's a low stress (no back pain), tolerable workout and I can watch stuff on TiVO while I do it. I've got nothing close to a six-pack, but this machine enables me to keep the flab from folding over the top of my jeans and feel good about my gut.It folds up nicely and doesn't take up too much room. And of all the ""ab"" gizmos I've tried over the years, it's the one I like the best."
2,Disapointment,I bought this piece of equipment hoping it would mimic the similiartype at my local health club. I don't know how to explain it butit just doesn't quite work the way it should. There is a reason it now goes for $50or less on ebay. The machine is not a total waste but I would not purchase again.Maybe I am just too spoiled with the professional quality abs machines at the gym.
4,The best ab machine i've used so far,Just to start out i don't actually own the machine but a friend lets me use it when we work out together and he uses it as well. I usually work out at the gym 3-4 times a week really working hard on my abs because i've had back problems...herniated discs 2 of them in lower back. this machine i believe works your abs better than the thousand dollar machine at the fitness center plus it helps your lower abs as well. so i don't really know how long it will hold up but it seems alright. plus you can turn your feet sideways and work on your lateral abs.
1,ab scissor,"do not waste your money. when item was used beyond stated return days to assure it was given a fair chance to actually work, company refused to take the item back. let the buyer beware."
3,-2 stars for finish,Never mounted so see other reviews for quality and reliability. Please note that the rings are junk. I also didn't like the FINISH on the scope! The black version looked good but the silver version looked like cheap sprayed on paint. The scope made my rifle look cheap instead of complementing it as it should. I know looks isn't everything but come on now....
2,a skeptical look,"This book has a lot of truth in it. Unfortunately, either I'm kind of dumb or it stoops to what I call ""emporors new clothes syndrome"". - it has such ""advanced"" formulas that most people are just not in a position to evaluate even though they think they can. I happen to offer an open prize for proof of free energy and constantly get people trying to get me to look at their theory. At this point, I feel that thick tomes of theory are a dime a dozen - I try to find people who have a real device before I'm willing to take a closer look at theory."
5,Go Blake go!,"This is the first album of Blake's that I have bought and it was WELL worth the money!! Since I heard the first single off of the album ""Some Beach"" I knew I was going to end up getting this. This cd is filled with up beat songs and of course ballads. There is not one song on this cd that is bad and I highly recommend this to anyone."
5,Blake does it again,"I just picked up a copy, and I love it! ""Some Beach"" is a great song, and all the other songs on the CD are just as amazing! I'm so glad I bought a copy! I don't think it will be leaving my CD player any time soon :)"
4,Almost great and damn good,"The song ""Some Beach"" caught my ear a year or so ago and I bought the CD with no other knowledge. Now, after a year, almost all of the songs remain favorites...even some of the embarassingly cute ones. There are a few formula tunes here but if you own this CD, it will get played a lot."
1,"""SOME BEACH IS THE ONLY GOOD SONG","I am quite surprised at all of the 5 star reviews. I like Blake Shelton. However the music here is just sub-par. Truly all is forgettable except ""Some Beach."" I would recommend Blake's Barn And Grill DVD with ""Some Beach"" on it. ""Austin"" and ""The Baby"" are on it as well.Don't waste your money on this one!!!"
4,Great Citizen Watch,"It made her eyes pop, and put a big smile on her face. Beautiful craftmanship, and technology."
5,Bought for my Fiancée,I was scared of purchasing a watch I couldn't see in my hands and get a feel for but the deal was to good to pass up plus I waited until the last second to buy my Fiancée her anniversary present. But when it came it was beautiful. I would like to note that this watch is little. It would look best on women with slim wrists. It looks fantastic on her. You cannot beat Eco-Drive for $120.00
5,Elegant and Casual at the same time,"I got this for my mom for Christmas since she adored my Citizen Eco-Drive watch, and she loves it. The face is beautiful and keeps time perfectly. Also due to it's design she can wear it dressed up for work or casually on the weekend. She gave me and the watch 5 stars :)"
2,Not as radiant as the pic,The pic gives an indication that the dial is radiant and shimmering... Instead it is plain white
4,Beautiful Watch,"I love the fact that this is an eco-drive watch. I can put it in the sun for a little while and let the battery charge. And you don't even need sunlight to charge the battery. It's very practical. The diamonds aren't overkill at all. I do wish that I bought the titanium model instead though. But I still love this watch.The only problem I had with it, is that the date wouldn't set properly. It would'nt catch so I had to manually turn the hour and minute hand to set the date. That would be the only draw back to this watch."
5,Christmas gift for the wife,"I searched all over town for a citizen watch for my wife for Christmas. As usual, there weren't any that I liked, or thought she'd like so I ordered this one. I was worried without handling it physically because it looked somewhat larger then some of the ones I looked at in town. I figured I'd return it if it was too big but to my surprise, it was perfect and better yet, she loves it. Plus I got a great deal on it:)"
1,Different from Online,"This watch is VERY different than the picture. It looks cheap and simple and very white. The description says the dial is white- but it just looks like a $20 watch from Walmart. This is my first disappointment with amazon. Get a good picture, for heavens sake."
2,ceramic soap dish easily pops off,"I bought these wall mounted soap containers for my big shower. They were attached to the wall about shoulder height. The soap dish part easily popped off the base with just a slight bump against it. Needless to say, they broke when landing on the tile floor, both of them, with the first shower use. Really cheap ceramic, it shattered into multiple pieces, some even sliver size. I tried to buy replacement parts, but had to go directly to the manufacturer who charged about the same price as Amazon did for the whole unit. Too bad they didn't make the soap dish out of plastic, otherwise it's an attractive idea. If you do buy this, I recommend that you superglue the dish to the base."
1,Buy something else,"I didn't use this light very much. I did follow the manufacturer's guidelines to charge the spotlight at least every 3 months. At the end of one year the light would go on brightly for about 15 seconds and then remain on very dimly for about 1 minute before completely dying. I now use a small Techlite. It is so much brighter, more compact and much more versatile. This I can take on walks when it is getting dark."
1,WiFi? Not Really!,"The wifi has never worked for this printer. Contacted HP, LinkSys, Dell, Apple. Its better to buy a regular printer and a wireless adapter than to buy this printer. Wish I had more luck with it."
4,want it to shine,I have tryed a few types of compound and this stuff works the best if you are looking for a glossy wet look this is the stuff you need
5,The most interesting story about Ingrid Bergman!,"It is a collection of conversation with people who are interesting. It teaches the appreciation for history, good fortune, knowledge and also good luck. Many parts show the history of the latest years, including World War II. The chapter based on Ingrid Bergman's letters to her cousin brought me a feeling of great admiration for a beautiful person and talented actress,"
4,Play for us Tim!,"I saw this movie on t.v. in the middle of the day while home sick from school about 20 years ago. It's the ultimate b-movie/cult film--I can't even believe it's on DVD! My dad watched it with me those years ago, and since then, whenever the subject of brainwashing, or cults, or any similar subject comes up in our conversation, we always repeat a line from this movie, during a scene when the brainwashees excitedly ask the mandollin playing guy: ""Play for us Tim!"" The line/scene is classic, disturbing and humorous--all at the same time! I didn't even remember the title of this movie until I decided to do some research on the internet. The only clue I had going for me was that I remembered that ""She"" was played by the same actress who played Barry Allen's mom on ""The Flash"" t.v. show from the early 90's. If you enjoy obscure, b-movie sci-fi, the ""Mysterious Two"" is for you!"
5,Weeeeird and one of a kind - it made my top ten list immediately!!!,"Wow!! This movie was ultra bizarre and out there (way way out there as it happens in this story!) Basically this is the real life story of Bo and Peep, leaders of the Heaven's Gate UFO cult and the mysterious circumstances surrounding the ""disappearance/alien abduction"" of about 30 people after a gathering in Waldport, Oregon. The acting by the leads (John Forsythe and Priscilla Pointer) is very disturbing, the dialog is very cryptic, and the images are very effective (ie. the lighting of the military base, the sequence with the laser-like optical illusion).. And check out the field full of suicide victims (you'll understand when you see it). ALL THIS PLUS IT IS A MADE FOR TELEVISION MOVIE! Best viewed in the dark accompanied by your teddy bear and favorite party favors.."
2,bleh,"I bought this book thinking that it would be somewhere along the lines of Go Ask Alice, but it turned out to be a real disspointment. The diary entries were so unrealistic, I found myself laughing at the parts that were entended to be emotionally upsetting, they were so clearly written by a pysciatrist. The world does not need another bs diary book, dont waste your money."
3,bearly there,"Despite the fact that I'm VERY disapointed Beatrice Sparks wrote this and not an ""anonomous teenager"" I still found it pretty good. It shows how you can get sucked into that kind of thing, it also makes you aware of that [frustuated] teacher( there's at least one). I say it would have been better if it REALLY written by a teenager!"
3,Real...or not?,I would honestly like to know why Beatrice Sparks does this. She is a respected Ph.D. Clearly it is her who writes the novels she has 'edited'. I think she feels teenagers can related to books by real people... but it is obvious that she is the one who writes these novels so how can we have respect her as a novelist? But the book was ok...I feel it doesnt seem real (because its not) when 'Jennie' is completly oblivous to what JJ is doing... that is really unrealistic ... so Dr.Sparks next time you write a novel... dont lie about it we will respect you alot more!
3,Confusing,"Though this is an amazing story, I found _Treacherous Love_ to be confusing and, believe it or not, at times dull. The exciting part of the story starts very late in the book. On the other hand, a lot can be learned from this novel, especially if it is a real diary, like it is said to be. As a 14-year-old girl, I could relate to the character and some of her experiences. If you are a teenager, particularly a teen-age girl, you might want to try this book. In retrospect, I am glad I read it, even if I did not really enjoy it during the reading."
1,Treacherous Love,"Treacherous Love edited by Beatrice Sparks is the journal of a 14 year old girl named Jennie. Her life turns upside down when her parents split up and her best friend gets a boyfriend. She feels so alone so she turns to her journal, until she meets her new math teacher Mr. Johnstone. Their relationship becomes more than just teacher and student. I think that this book, much like the rest of B. Sparks' book, there may be parts that are true but I don't think the whole thing is. If you had a choice between this book and something else , get the other book. I wanted to stop reading this so many times but I made my self push through it."
3,Just ok...,"My students thought this one was ok. Sparks is great, but this one was very slow to get to the action."
2,don't waste your time,"I didn't really enjoy this book. I couldn't relate to any of it and it was boring. Instead, read Go Ask Alice."
1,Not how a teenager really thinks or feels,"I read this book because it looked good and I saw a lot of good reviews on amazon, but it was a huge disappointment. It's not realistic at all. She is constantly saying she is a negative thinker and going off to the park and crying with her friends or mother and just making all of these connections that a real teenager never would. There are too many CAPITALS and exclamation marks!!! With everything she said its almost mocking, that teenagers are total idiots. Its distracting from the story, that in reality isn't that good. It's hard to explain, but I was not surprised a psychiatrist wrote this. This person obviously was just trying to tell teenagers not to have relationships with teachers, and not writing a good book. It's a disappointment. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. This person needs to stop writing books, they are horrible."
3,Victimization and preaching,"There are two things Beatrice Sparks is good at (sorry to disappoint you, kids, there's no ""anonymous teenager"" handing their diaries over to her for editing) - creating victims and preaching. Even while dealing with issue of teenage pregnancy, she chose to have the character be raped so that she was absolved from responsibility. This book is no exception. As for the preaching - the character constantly berates herself for not being positive enough, and reminding herself what she's grateful for, usually accompanied by capital letters and excessive exclamation marks. The narrator is too-good-to-be-true and her style too juvenile for her age, but if you enjoyed other works by Dr Sparks, pick it up - it's almost identical to everything else she's written."
2,Eh....,"This book was ok... After reading a few pages I had to assume that this was not a realy diary. It is tto preachy (like how she is always scolding herself for being sad or mad at someone, just not something a real teenage girl would do). Also after a while I started to hope either something interesting and realistic would happen or the book would just be over. The ending is too perfect and abrupt for an ""actual"" girl's account of her affair with her teacher. I have read quite a few diary books and this one is not one of the better and more believable ones. It made me kind of depressed for this girl who is being used and I am not sure whether or not it was a waste of time to read it. Either way, teenage girls might want to read it so they can see the signs of a teacher who wants more that just good grades from you."
2,Unrealistic,"This book carries an important message but honestly, I can't stand the way it has been edited. It's marketed as a real diary but thats impossible to believe. It's not a 14 year old's diary at all which is pretty distracting. That alone ruined the book, if its not a true story it shouldn't claim to be one."
4,Treacherous Love,"This book it is in diary form and the main character is Jennie. Jennie's life is very complex and when she finds someone to make it go all away it turns out to not be what she expects. Jennie falls in love with her math teacher and loves everything that he does and it just so happens he does everything to make her fall in love with him. He traps girls to trust him and then fall in love with him. When Jennie finds out who he really is she does nothing but stay in bed.I thought this book was very good to relate with a true-life teenager. It shows some of the problems they have and how one problem can wreck their lives forever. This book was very emotional and easy to relate to. Also, it has characters you can understand and know so much about them you think you've known them forever."
4,"Interesting Story, Terrible Narration","I know this book is written as a diary, but I do believe that it could have been written much better. It doesn't seem like a fourteen year old girl, maybe an eleven year old, but not fourteen. The main character seems really fake and plastic in the beginning especially.The story itself, however, makes up for it. It's a story of how obsession can go too far, and the long winding road of love and betrayal and heartbreak. I like it, but wish it was written better."
2,Leaves a weird taste and smell!,These do a great job for non stick but they leave a weird taste and smell on the baked goods. I rarely use them anymore.
2,Dull,"I ended up listening to this once and then trading it in. I found the melodies and chants to be very repetitious and I thought the whole thing was a bit ""gimmicky."" The final CD sums everything up nicely to the point that I think one CD would have been enough. I simply couldn't bring myself to listen to it a second time. I think it is too wordy. I didn't quite get what I was looking for, but I wish everyone else the best in their spiritual search."
4,moving....,"highlights of the lp include the haunting""little lambs"" and the original""rhythm of my heart"",written by Jordan,covered by Rod Stewart. anyone who enjoys this lp,MUST get Jordan's lp""talking through pictures"".a decade later,""..pictures""remains a golden little secret of mine.""reckless valentine"" continues mr.jordans quiet genius.keep 'em coming,Mark."
5,The two Paris albums are a steal! You won't be disappointed!!,"The Paris Concerts are two of my favorite Bill Evans albums. In my opinion, he is at the very top of his game on these recordings and I especially like the way that Marc Johnson and Bill Evans play together. It is reminiscent of the early Scott LaFaro recordings, but even better. There is a depth and sensitivity here that represents a very mature Bill Evans at the height of his ability. In short, these are both pure magic."
5,Turbo Tax '99,Package arrived on time. It was exactly what I needed! It was definetly worth the money.
5,Classic Set,"Bobby Caldwell is a Multi-Talented Instrumentalist,Sognwriter&Vocalist. this Album is nice from start to finish,but it's the title cut that alone is worth a 5 all unto itself. Bobby Caldwell not only has a timeless Groove but the words&vocals are On Point. this song alone is one of the Greatest songs that I have heard over the past almost 30 years.smooth&On time."
3,And the best was yet to come...,"Much to his despair, Bobby Caldwell is mainly known for ""What you won't do for love"". Although it is a gem, he has many more five star songs and albums. On this cd, listen to the Kalimba tunes (made popular by EWF) on the romantic ""My flame"", the Lou Rawls like ""Love won't wait"", or the rythmic ""Down for the third time"", where Bobby plays the guitar like so many artists play it today, 20 years later..."
5,Wonderful inspiration,"This book gave me so many thought provoking tools to work with, truly inspiring a must read."
2,Look past the hype please,"People always like to feel that they've had their eyes opened about something.Though I applaud the effort, and the research and historical facts are phenomenal in this book, it is NOT well written.It is a hard read, not very interesting, and Mr. Perryman is a historian, NOT a writer. I had a hard time staying focused while reading this.Not to mention there are numerous typographical errors and grammatical mistakes in this book. That alone made me put it down."
3,Knowledge is Truth - Propaganda is Manipulation,"I was impressed by the depth of Mr. Perryman's honesty in examining the historic and political truths of the democrats real relationship toward Blacks. Why democrats are credited with so many things to free and equalize the opportunities and freedoms of black people that were actually put forward by republicans, I will never fully understand.Any democrat in general, or person of color in particular, who falsely believes the democrats are more for them than the republicans needs to read this book. The truth is out there, and it is not what any of us popularly believed.""The democrats didn't fall in love with the black folk, they fell in love with the black vote."" ~ Wayne Perryman"
4,Easy to use - smooth application,"I recently purchased some Laura Mercier cream eye shadow and thought I had a brush. Did not, so was using my finger and while it worked it altered the shade or application and so I got this brush. I have other Laura brush's and tend to like them and this one does not disapoint. Good buy"
3,Not so good.,"I love snapcase but this cd is extremely boring. I bought it the first day it was released. I listened to it twice and thought that maybe it would just take some getting used to. Three months later, it hardly ever makes it into my cd player.I saw them in Chicago a few weeks after this CD was released. They were good except for the songs off of End Transmission. People were just standing around waiting for them to play some of their older stuff.I'm only giving three stars because I respect snapcase. Otherwise I would have given TWO.PIANOS????? C'mon!!"
1,Very disappointing,"I too have listened to snapcase since the early days. I believe that they peaked with ""Progression"" and went downhill ever since. Yes, they are everchanging and evolving, but they have lost that something that made you wanna change things in this world for the better. While lyrically the album is very cool, the music and energy is weak. I can still remember when I first got ""Progression"". Just the opening to that album with the drums was enough to get you amped for the start of the day! But after spending my money on this CD, I was so bummed. ""Designs"" was borderline. There were moments of weakness and cheese, but enough of that snapcase energy and passion to make it good. Do yourself a favor, pick up ""Progression"" and ""Steps"" and forget the rest. They will never be the same as a band. Are you tuned in?"
2,Is Snapcase Selling Out????,"Well....i'll sart by saying i've only listened to the samples of the songs here at Amazon.com, but usally i can tell if a snapcase album is going to be good just by little snipits...Im praying to God the website just picked Not-So-Good parts of each song(Not a good way to sell a cd guys)It's hard to think that snapcase could put out a bad album....I have been listening to them since the Steps album and with each release it gets better and better, but im not so sure with this one.....and remember snapcase has always been about hardcore and hard music and by what iv'e heard im not sure there sticking to there roots..........so the best thing i can say is....Hardcore kids(Sick Of It All,Earth Crisis,Strife,Hatebreed,Blood For Blood) you might be let down....Raido kids(Limp Bizkit,Disturbed,Godsmack)You guys will probly like it."
4,Another solid disc from a solid band,"Snapcase deliver on one of the most anticipated hardcore albums of the year. The familiar Snapcase power and package is present throughout the entire CD, but Snapcase is definitely looking to make a statement. It sounds as if there have been heavy influences from bands such as the Deftones and At The Drive-In throughout the disc as Snapcase have raised the bar in hardcore by involving ambient breaks and making the music much more complex than your average hardcore album. Even with the experimentation there is still the trademark sound and the songs on this disc are no less heavy than anything on one of their prior releases.While this release treads new ground there are a few bumps along the road but it only leaves more room for growth. Look for this to be a pivotal recording in the band's history, I can't wait to hear what their next release will sound like."
5,There is no comparison.,Snapcase are undoubtedly set in stone as to where their musical feet are. Ever since the early 90's they've been innovative and a step ahead of the program. I'm sure I don't need to tell you any of this considering you're taking the time to read this. This band is one of the greatest bands ever in my world and is just as good as ANY huge rock act: I overuse Tool. This whole cd is an all around perfect album. If I don't have to skip a track it's good. Like so many of the other Snapcase albums this is through and through groundbreaking. Unlike other Snapcase albums it is VERY much more experimental and has elements of even early 80's new-wave in it. People say after Rage died so did political rock: what about Snapcase and Boysetsfire? From start to finish this cd burns into your skull. This cd definately will put them AT LEAST on a map to where most people will know who they are. Love'em to death.
3,Verizon phones from Amazon must be activated by authorized dealer,"I live in the mountains where only Verizon wireless gets a signal, so when I needed another line, there wasn't a question of carrier. However, when you purchase a cell phone and Verizon plan through Amazon, it will come without a phone number and neither Amazon nor Verizon customer service will activate it. You will have to take the phone to a authorized Verizon dealer to set up your phone. It may be a small thing, but for someone like me who's 40 minutes from a dealer, it may be worth the extra money to purchase the phone from Verizon."
5,SONIC ROCKS!!!!!!,"The game was fantastic but the soundtrack is the best ever.I havent stopped listening to it since I got it(2 days ago).But people I think that you should watch out for song 22 because its a bit [wierd]. Never the less, SSOONNIICC RROOCCKKSS!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Makes a good compilation,"If you are a Sonic fan you do need this disc set, but you shouldn't over expect. The main problem is there are so many songs that really have no direction or melody, and quite a few that DO. So, you are going to spend a lot of time on the fast forwarding button. I have made a list of all the songs I like and the list is about 20+ songs, which sounds impressive except when you remember the set has 50+ songs on it!You can't fault them for the packaging. The artwork/posters is beautiful and there is so much to it it's hard to keep the case CLOSED! And to me that's a good thing. Sadly, as many here seem to suggest Jun has phoned in this performance. Maybe he was tapped out from SA1 which is far better? At any rate, there is a lot of goodness here, just not as much as there could have been. If you don't have the Sonic Heroes soundtrack yet, that is far more consistant this set. Live & Learn... is right."
3,Might need to play the game first,"I have mixed feelings about this album. I was disappointed when I ordered it, and found the songs to be very mediocre in comparison to the music from the first Sonic Adventure. They don't seem as well orchestrated as the first; they sound much more juvenile and straightforward. However, I later got around to playing the game, and I was able to appreciate the music some more after that. While there are some good songs on here, this album still leaves a lot to be desired. I hope the Sonic Team stays on their toes a little more next time."
2,Its a phrasebook much more than a dictionary,We mustn't have selected carefully enough but this was not appropriate for what we were after. Fabulous for someone wanting a better level of Hungarian than just the essential tourist phrases but we wanted a way more comprehensive dictionary for a Hungarian speaker.
2,Missing the Pronunciation of Hungarian words,"Because the Hungariqan alphabet and especially the pronunciation is different from English, it it a must to have next to each Hungarian word or phrase, its pronunciation - and this book it missing it!Yes, they have pronunciation of letters in separate page, but you have to look back each time you want to learn how to prononuce a word.If you're a beginner, stay away from this book."
2,Not Very Detailed,I bought this book to help me translate messages and Hungarian ancestral documents for my genealogical research. This book is has very limited vocabulary. I am currently searching for a better more comprehensive Hungarian/English dictionary. Spend more money and buy a better book.
1,Look out -- only a summary!,Just like the above review -- I'm very disappointed that there was no warning I wasn't getting the entire book. I'm not going to hassle with a refund for $4 -- but I AM going to warn others.
1,Yuck!,"Having recently finished this book, I wonder if the other reviewers were reading the same book as I. Paralysis has an interesting premise- stealthy biotech industry development of a deadly virus while various ""good guys"" begin following clues to unmasking the scheme- but the plots never gel. Budding love stories are clumsily injected, with mind-numbing repetition of the protagonists' various phobias and quirks. The purpose of the plot is never fully developed, and the would-be heroes neither decypher it nor foil it, but in the end are rescued by external agents whose provenance is never really explained.The author does set a scene well, and individual scenarios are well described. It is the overarching lack of a narrative which hangs together and ties up the loose ends which disappoints. On the whole, an unsatisfying read, and with so many good page-turners out there to choose from, I strongly recommend you avoid wasting your time on this one."
2,Adolescent romance,"I found the business and biological mystery interesting. These kept me skimming to the end. However, the romantic issues and dialogue were painfully adolescent. He would have been wiser to have left them out altogether. It also was obvious and evident who would be killed and who would live, although I was surprised at the savagery with which he terminated James and the reporter."
1,Paralysis,"Poorly written and cheaply bound, it feel apart in the middle of reading it.Not captivating or interesting, poorly developed characters and not a well thought out conclusion. Very trite."
3,"Okay, worth a read","Similar to James Rollins, Lincoln Childs, Douglas Preston genera of writing. Childs-Preston is far superior; this book is most like Rollins. Book was an okay-to-decent read, but I had a really hard time giving it a fair chance since my first impression was so negative. My first impression? It was based upon the cover, when I first looked at it in the store.......from the get-go I had a really hard time ignoring the fact that although the synopsis states the book is set in South America........the picture on the cover is Multnomah Falls, Oregon. Couldn't he, with a tiny bit of effort (google photos, perhaps?) have picked out an actual South American waterfall?"
1,The Worst Sports Has To Offer,The name of this book should be re-titled 'A Shark Never Sleeps: Wheeling and Dealing with the NFL's Most CLASSLESS Agent.' This guy is so disgusting I won't bother to give my litany of negative aspects of this book. The only interesting part of this book is that it exposes the ugly side of professional sports.
3,Enjoyable enough for a quick read,"Rosenhaus isn't a great writer and he talks about how amazing he is through the entire book. However his story is interesting, impressive, and the narcissistic narration sort of authenticated it for me. Easily read in a day or two and sort of a documentary on the Sports Agency business of the 90s."
4,Enjoyable,"This book was a good read. The writing was not great, but I got the point. A must read for aspiring sports agents and true NFL fans. Rosenhaus is quite a character and his story is truly unique. Gives a inside account of the inner workings of the NFL and the contract negoitiation process from recruitment to finalization. Rosenhaus is truly passionate about his profession and the NFL. GO SHARK GO!"
1,Absolutely Pathetic,"I got this book hoping to read about life on the business side of the NFL. Instead, I got a couple of hundred pages about how great Drew Rosenhaus is. This book is the most repulsive I have ever read. The biggest themes in the book are Drew's good looks, incredible intelligence, unbelieveable drive, and his insatiable greed. The guy put a MODELING PICTURE of his girlfriend in the pictures section! Give us a break Drew! We're not impressed!Otherwise, a great story about a shallow man chasing empty ideals. Do not waste a second on this book!"
1,"Wow! He's Some Kinda Symptom . . . Er, Guy!","October 6, 2002Hoping for a peek into the arena of sports agency, Ipicked this up one lazy afternoon. Wow! I suppose ifyou're the right sort of person with the right sense ofhumor, you could have a lot of fun wallowing inside thisfellow Drew Rosenhaus's own fascinated vision of himselfand his life--replete with numerous descriptions of howcrafty and tough he is, as well as an insert bikini photoof his model girlfriend (with whom he's formed a deep,lasting pair-bond, I'm sure).However, it's more likely you might be left gaping at aprinted ego that approaches the sociopathic, ponderingabout what publisher and editor were possibly thinking,and wondering how many Drew Rosenhauses are outthere, tolerated, even rewarded, in this, the tackiest,but best dressed, of all possible worlds.Tolerated and rewarded not just in professional sports,which would be bad enough, but in civil law, corporatefinance, government . . ."
2,This guy loves himself and only himself...,"I could not belive how someone could be this self involved... I am a negotiator and was hoping for good negotiating advice but got something much different. I am sure that half of this book was untrue, however I have to give credit were credit is due, he did make it to the top. I just hope that after the realease of this book he is able to stay there, ""now that would be impressive""..."
1,"If you want to know why sports is what it is, read this book","I am involved professionally with the NFL and I know Drew Rosenhaus, who claims to be the model for the bad agent in ""Jerry Maguire.'' He's not. The model works for an outfit very much like IMG, known in the business as ""I Am Greedy.'' Yes, Rosenhaus is a shark, who cares little for his clients. But what does it say for the publishing industry that it would publsih this kind of self-serving drivel? And what does it say to people who buy it? (I got my copy for free)."
5,Wow: I have much greater respect for Drew Rosenhaus now,"Say what you want about Drew Rosenhaus, but his story about he became the NFL's most elite agent is nothing less than inspiring. He outworked and outhustled the rest of the agents out there, and that is the main reason the agents all despise him.Sure he's contrived, arrogant, and greedy: but that's EXACTLY the characteristics I would want in my agent. The stories he shares from his college days to the present day of representing NFL superstars are both entertaining and hilarious. Not many personal stories inspire me, but this is the exception."
1,A total scam,"This lamp stopped working right after I took it out of the shippment box. I also saw that alot of review were complaining about the same problem. How disappointing it is to see your child happy with it then all of sudden it doesn't work!!!!!!!!Amazon should remove it completely, enough how many people wasted their money, plus the disappointment of a child should be a major issue here."
1,If it worked.....,It would be great if the lights actually worked but it doesn't...the green light flashes that's itI'll try opening the light n replacing the bulbs but it requires such a tiny screwdriver I may have to go buy one for it. Whole lot of hassle for a simple light
2,RED LIGHT DON'T TURN ON,"I got the lamp for my new Grandson's room, I was very happy because is a nice touch for the Disney Cars decorated bedroom, on Wednesday when I finished the room & turn on the lamp it look great, then when my Grandson came for Thanksgiving and I went to turn on the lamp, the RED light didn't turn on, I'm really very disappointed because I already threw the packaging away. I don't know if I can purchase another lamp & return the defective one that I have in the same packaging for a refund. I really want to have a lamp that works, seller please respond."
1,Good for 3 hours only.,"Bought this for my son for Christmas. The lights flash randomly and there is no way to control them. After 3 hours, only the green light works."
2,Tiny and Cheap.,"This item is very small, it is clearly stated in the dimensions description, (keep in mind the height includes the stand) but if you fail to notice, and you are thinking this thing is kinda large, you will think it is a joke when you see it. This item is everything that used to be associated with things from China, cheap, poorly assembled, parts loose. There was a big glue smear on one of the lenses and 2 of the bulbs were loose. The yellow and green light cycle off/on randomly, but the red is always on. Unclear if that is the design. This is a functional piece of junk. But if you love tiny, cheaply built stop lights, this is the crown jewel."
2,cute but cheap,I bought this to go with my son's train. It is really cheap. My three year dropped the light on the carpet and two of the lights broke. I bought some more bulbs but the red light connection broke off when I tried to change the bulb. Now it is really just decorative because it does not work. All this happen over a two day period so he never really got to use it.
4,great but be careful,i got this lamp it was great i have one my cousin has on and he droped his and it worked but the light blinked differnly than what they are suppoused to but it good i would recomend it buy it why not but be gentle with
3,Not as bad as I expected,"I read the reviews after I ordered this product- I'm new to Amazon, I'll know better next time. So I was terrified when I opened the packaging, afraid it wouldn't work. So far mine works great. Although, it is VERY cheaply made. Fragile is definitely an appropriate word. I'm going to sit mine on a dresser so hopefully it won't break in half, which it looks like it could do any minute. NOT FOR CHILDREN."
1,cheaply made it didnt work when i received it.,Junk..dont buy your wasting your money. Cheaply made and didnt work when I got it...I thought it was bigger and the quality was better. Requesting a refund. You can have it back.
1,do not buy,This china made product worked for a total of 2 days.What else you would expect from it? Total waste of money........
3,Too Convenient.,"Waldman can write -- no doubt about that. But her plotting with this book in particular left me confused and unsatisfied. And the motivations behind her protagonist's actions are also a bit sketchy.There were too many loose ends here and not enough beef... Characters are introduced and then conveniently manipulated, killed off, or abandoned. The sub-plot about Juliet's husband and his lawsuit also seems a bit too convenient -- merely a chance for Juliet to redeem herself in his eyes.I'd like to see something with more ""oomph"" and a little less carefully-scripted-plot-designed-to-show-how-bad-the-establishment-is."
3,"Is it really the last ""Juliet"" mystery ?","Not the best one from Ayelet Waldman. Starts with a ""Liberal"" whining that goes and goes for awhile then the real story starts. First ""Juliet Applebaum"" story that I was not sad to finish. Disappointed reader."
3,A hidden but sparkling Swedish gem. Uncover it.,"Eversince Soundtrack Of Our Lives released 'Behind The Music', I've been searching for another Swedish export with the same type of power, diversity, and production slickness...I may have found it with Citizen Bird's (formerly Silverbullit) self-titled album. Earlier in the decade, this brief spurt of Swedish bands ranged from spacey ambience and garage-rock to bland indie sounds, but nothing that matched the retro-psychadelia meets 70's rock groove of 'Behind The Music'. Yet if you backtrack a few years earlier, you will find it with Citizen Bird's sophomore effort. Just think a combination of the Soundtrack Of Our Lives' Stones meets Zeppelin guitar-swagger, Spacemen 3 or early Spiritualized, along with flashes of The MC5. Who knows, Citizen Bird could even be considered the Scandanavian cousin of the Black Rebel Motorcycle Club or The Warlocks. Regardless a really nice find, and I tip my hat towards Epitonic for leading me in the right direction."
5,"Read book before you see movie ""For Colored Girls""","This book powerful and believable compared to the movie ""For Colored Girls."" The women are smart and proactive. The dialogue is both beautiful and visual"
4,Very enjoyable,"I bought this album on sale and on a whim several years ago, and it finds itself back in my listening rotation every few months. This is not an album one falls desperately in love with, such love is short-lived anyways; rather, this album is simply pleasant to listen to, and will be pleasant to listen to for years to come."
1,120 pages of abysmally typeset glossary and powerpoint,"I can only suppose that the editorial reviewers never read an actual copy of this book. Several sections of it were so poorly typeset (spaces inserted into the middle of words) as to be quite difficult to read. The content was highly repetititive, containing bulleted lists in the text that were then reproduced as tables with the same material in not one but two columns. Most of the little information there was consisted merely of definitions of the various terms encountered in project management, with no real explanation of how to implement these ""tools"" to make a project happen."
5,The game metaphor makes learning project management easy.,"Project management is a complex subject. However, Dave Nesbit has tried to make understanding it easier by comparing it to a strategy game, with the added dimension of people. This books give excellent insights into how to develop the leadership skills necessary to successfully lead a project. In addition, it provides many key lessons learned, or secrets, to success. I strongly recommend that project managers read this before their next project."
5,"Great album, this one is a keeper!!",This is one of the best albums. The people who are knocking this album and say they know why Deathrow didn't want anything to do with it are out of the loop. Obviously they do not know what the real story is. I believe this is an awesome album and brings back some great memories. Highly recommended.
3,ventures into the darkside of life and the future,"First of all, I bought this cd for like 3 bucks at an amc in cali. There is one really tight song on the cd called ""secret plan"". I would put it in my top 5 songs. Then you have a few better than average tracks like, 4 my doggz, well that's pretty much it. It's worth 3 dollars"
3,NEEDS IMPROVEMENT,"THE D.O.C'S VOICE HAS REALLY BEEN MESSED UP SINCE HIS ACCIDENT IN 1990. DESPITE HIS BAD VOICE, THIS ALBUM ACTUALLY STARTED OUT GREAT. BUT HALFWAY INTO THIS ALBUM, THE D.O.C. STARTS TO BECOME LOST. SONGS SUCH AS ''RETURN OF DA LIVIN DEAD''& ''SECRET PLAN'' KEEP THIS ALBUM FROM REALLY BEING MEDIOCRE. THIS ALBUM IS A FAR CRY FROM ''NO ONE CAN DO IT BETTER'', BUT, IT'S WORTH A LISTEN."
4,Decent replacement and easy to install. Not long enough for double strand lacing.,"These replacement laces are a decent replacement for the original laces and it only took me about 20 minutes to re-lace one recliner. I was a bit disappointed that the replacement laces are only long enough to allow a single strand lacing rather than the double strand of the original.This is the only reason for giving the product 4 stars instead of 5. Had the manufacturer made each of the laces twice as long even at a slightly higher price, I would have given it the full five. If you want double laces you'll need to buy two kits per chair. It would also be great if the manufacturer would UV protect them in some way so that they last longer."
3,didn't fit through the holes,Shipping was fast. The problem with this cording was the end piece that insert into the brackets of the chair was too big. It fit through but when you have to go back through again to make it taught the end piece did not fit though to double it up. It ended up making the chair way too soft to sit in.
2,Didn't last long,"The lacing broke after a couple of months. But I think it was because of the design of the chair. I did find some lacing(very cheap) at ace hardware. It doesn't have the little thingies at the end, but I improvised."
5,Tricky to find thid one/,Have some favorite lounge chairs which took a beating with our Arizona summers. The lacing just crumbled and after some searching found the right replacement to replace the the rotted ones. It was an easy job and my chairs are now like new!!
4,Kwik Sew review,"Though slightly dated this pattern book was a great find and is apparently used by several people who use the leotard designs as a basis for dancewear, skatewear, and ballgowns. I don't think I would go as far as attempting to make swim though!"
1,This Book [is bad] Beyond Belief...Stay Away From It!!...,"This book is proof that, if you had a lobotomy performed on yourself, and then wrote some useless basic information about screenwriting, printed that info in a 30-point font (NO JOKE), then you too could be the author of this piece of garbage. The contents of this book would fill maybe four standard 8.5"" X 11"" pages. In an effort to make this book seem that there is more information in it, a 30-point font was used, wasting lots of paper. There are trees that died an unnecessary death, to have this book printed. The book cover is hyped with one of the more respected authors on screenwriting, I can only gather Lew Hunter was drunk, stoned or is dead (The dead can't sue you). If Lew Hunter is alive and actually thinks that this book is funny, then stay away from his books on screenwriting also.Stay away from this book. ... You have been warned!!..."
2,Shallow,"This book in completely based on the author's own experiences and lacks depth. She gives many examples of her own life and how praying one simple prayer changed everything. For example she prayed for a husband, and poof in a few months she got one, etc. Life doesn't work that way. We can pray for soemthing for years and not get it. She presents prayer as having fast results. She ""promises"" if you pray her prayers for 20 days you will see drastic results. Give me a break. God works out things in our life as a process and he gives us a lifetime to do it in. This type of teaching can be very disappointing for new beleivers."
1,i'm giving this away,"i've been a christian all my life and was looking for something written by a lay christian woman to help me enrich my spirituality. this is why i bought this book. but it was a disastrous purchase. i agree with an earlier review: this book is shallow. almost everything is based on stormie's personal experience, her own interpretations of scripture, and plentiful quotes from the bible--but without context. but she obviously does not have yet a thorough and well-contemplated understanding of the bible and other christian concepts. maybe another reason i didn't like this book is because i'm catholic, and stormie isn't. so i was mentally arguing with her while reading the book. those who are new to christianity and looking towards religion for a ""quick fix"" in their life would probably get more from this book. the lord did answer my prayer and i found a copy of ""full of grace"" by johnette benkovich. that is a richer more in-depth guide for lay women looking for the path to holiness."
4,A Very Cool Soundtrack,"Sonic Battle 2 : Cuts Unlished is great. It has the City Escape song, from level one which is my favorite song. All the songs really do fit the characters, and what there all about. (Especially Tail's theme, Belive in Myself) My only dissapointed is Amy Rose's theme &quot;My Sweet Passion&quot; not being on here. Even though the full version is not on the Sonic Battle 2 game (you can find the full version on Sonic DX), it would have been a great addition to this soundtrack."
5,Sonic Adventure 2 Soundtrack,"This soundtrack is awesome. Rock, techno, rap and other musical styles are gathered here in this tremendous collection of songs.There are all the main themes, including ""Live and Learn"", the official rocking theme of Sonic Adventure 2. And let's not forget ""Escape from the City"", the music played for the beginning of the first stage in the Hero game, which is also way cool.Get this soundtrack if you want good music, but especially if you loved the game. After all, the soundtrack to Sonic Adventure 2 is partly what made it so strong"
3,art kit,"The art supplies are wonderful, but it is awkward to close without everything from the top spilling out. Also there was a crack in the plastic insert, which makes it seem a little cheap."
2,no wonder it's out of print....,"Historically useful but passe, the book is written with a friendly tone of Machiavellian paranoia. The constant emphasis on COMPETITION between superpowers is boyish as well as tedious."
5,A must have for all fans of the Hercules TV show!!!,This disc is superb! It has a consistantly sharp and colorful picture and 2 of the original Hercules movies on the one disc! One of the movies has Lucy Lawless as an amazon warrior from before her Xena days. The other co-stars Renee O'Connor from before her Gabrielle days. This is a fun and great looking disc which is a must have for all fans of the Hercules and Xena TV shows!
1,WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,"This game is about the wost game I have ever played. I have played bad games before but this is definently the worst. the graphics are bad , The game is confusing , and is very BORING. some suggestions buy Tony Hawks Pro Skater , Nascar 98 ,99, 00 , and Rumble are some very cool games."
1,THE WORST GAME EVER INVENTED!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought this game when i was but a young lad. I thought it would be fun because it sort of related to kids. I was sooooooo wrong. The game is too confusing and unrealistic. I mean, seriously, a bubble gun? What good is a bubble gun to a kid flying through time and space? That's the least of my worries when i get sucked into a time vortex. I tried playing this game last night because since now I'm a more experienced gamer, I might have a little fun with it. Still nothing good about this game. Too confusing, and there are a lot of time limits, which I hate. Hope this has saved you some $$ in this bad economy."
1,Your Worst Nightmare!,This game is horrible! I would give it -5 stars if I could! The graphics are so bad that they make you die while you are playing it! DO NOT BUY THIS TERRIBLE AND STUPID GAME!
2,Voices of Summer,Not a book that you sit down and read on a lazy afternoon. The structure and the data given make it more reference material. In that regard it scores well. It did not indicate that in the write-up. Disappointing.
3,Not really a timer...,"When the word timer is included in a products title, it seems like it should be able to keep track of at least a set of amount of time (although an adjustable timer is always better). If you flip this product over and time it to see how long it takes for the liquid to drip down, it varies from time to time. So yes, nice to look at, but practically speaking abit of a disappointment."
3,Disappointed,"This toy was wrapped in an oil soaked plastic, I washed it numerous times but I couldn't get rid of the horrible smell... I got this for my son with severe autism when I found it in a search....since he tends to put things in his mouth I couldn't allow him to have this toy. It was MUCH smaller than I thought as well. Also doesn't seem very durable. Cheaply made."
1,not what I expected,"This item is not what I expected. The item itself is fine, but I did not know it was only about 4"" tall and 2"" wide."
4,Excellent Beginner's How-To Guide,"Do you follow instructions easily? Then this Do-It-All manual is for you. I was looking for some insight on fixing small things around the house, like replacing my ceiling fans and installing new cabinents. This book covers all that, plus more. Plus, there are in-depth reviews of the basic mechanics of nearly all parts of your home; plumbing, electricity, masonry...it teaches you step by step the basic carpentry skills you need to be sucessful in any project around the house. I highly recommend it. I'm a woman who has always been great with her hands...and just needed a guide. With this book, I'll be the Mr. Fix-It in our house. :)"
5,this is the edion to get,I have this edition to buy. It is wonderful and filled with many more than the current edition (2011). It is close to 2x the information. So I recommend the +900 page edition.It has most information you need for doing projects around the house. This is the most complete home how to book I have seen.
4,Great for the Novice,This book is a very thick tome with very colorful and detailed pictures that add to the detailed written description on numerous around-the-home projects and fix-it jobs. Great for the novice.
3,Good but missing something,"I have looked through the book in a general fashion, and I thought it was average at best. I can imagine it is hard to write these types of books... but anyway, one of the things I did not like is that for someone like me who does not yet know which tool is what, some pictures of tools would have been great. They state which tool is necessary for the project, but I have no idea how the tool looks like and it takes me a looooong time to find that particular tool at the hardware store, especially since there are tools that are so specific for jobs nowadays.The pictures, or drawgins, I thought were pretty good, but not great.Anyway, for the price it is a good book, but I'm not excited about the book. There is just something that didn't click when I opened it."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This book was awful, if your considering purchasing this I suggest you find it in the library and take a quick look first."
5,HB-36 Lens Hood,"The quality & quick mailing, was greatly appreciated.Thanks again, for your vast amount of products to choose from.Doc G"
4,On my second one,"This hood is great, but i had to replace it as my first one broke during a tragic tripod accident, it originally came with my nikkor 70-300mm i did notice though i would often switch it backwards (like the way it was on the lense when i purchased it) to store it, and it was starting to warp a little bit, that i didn't expect, i thought the plastics/material would be a litte harder, otherwise this is a great product."
3,Replacement,"I dropped my camera and snapped the small retaining ring off. The replaced one is ok except, it would be much better if it were not made of plastic. Not very sturdy with the amount of use my camera gets."
5,One of the best I've read,"It is wonderful to have Amazon and be able to find such wonderful out if print books. Thank you Amazon!This is one of the best of it's type I have read. I strongly recommend it to anyone who seeks to know more about Jesus and His way. It is a wake-up for anyone who is housed in a home church.""And I heard another voice from heaven saying, 'Come out of her, my people, lest you share in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues. For her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities'"" (Revelation 18:4,5)."
3,It's Hot!,"I use this pack quite often and I do like it. I did not realize just how small it is, it does not cover the entire area of the small of I back like I thought it would. I have since bought a larger one and use this one over my shoulder instead. It takes a couple of minutes to get it really hot, but it does hold the heat for about 20 minutes."
2,Beware of the Reverb,"I bought this CD in Hawaii unheard. It is, incidentally Kana King and his Hawaiians playing here. Fantastic musicians, arrangements etc. but I think after the sessions the producers - years after for all I know - took the steel guitar tracks and added untold quantities of reverb. Hard to believe the band recorded it thus. Painful to listen to."
4,A Romance Junkie,"Catherine's sister was married to Rico's brother and on her wedding day Catherine and Rico met. They were so attracted to each other that they couldn't take their hands off each other. Catherine's sister was a gold digger and Rico heard a conversation between the two, and he was horrified. So even though he fell in love with Catherine, he walked out on her because he thought she was just like her sister. After the accident that left her six month old nice an orphan Rico walks back into her life and married her, so they could get custody of the baby. This gets the sparks flying between the two. He's a hard headed, good looking rich guy who's as stubborn as a mule. The ending is not that romantic, but it was ok."
3,"Fun, but not Sandra Hill's best.......","""The Love Potion"" was definitely a fun book...it had some great moments..and some REALLY sexy love scenes...the book was a bit silly...but sweet...my main reason for not loving this book? Well, while I found the characters to be endearing...they just werent really ""my type""...maybe thats sounds odd, but I dont know how else to explain it.....all in all.... an entertaining read...but not my favorite."
5,The chemistry between the Chemist and the Lawyer is great!,"I loved this book! This is the first book of Ms. Hill's series about the LeDeux siblings. I strongly suggest reading them all. The cajun guy in this book is HOT! I've never been to New Orleans, but after reading about how Ms. Hill described it and passion the LeDeux and their aunt showed regarding it makes me want to go. This is not one of those romance novels were the whole novel is the just about sex. There is more to it, like the love potion in jelly beans. I will be re-reading this book."
3,What am I missing?,"I started reading, then put this book down for a month. And only browsed thru the last 100 pages. It just didn't grab me. And I don't really know why. I'll try is again in a year or so. It seems to have all the elements I usually love (humor, sensuality). But... Go figure."
3,Pedantic & Repetitive,"This book was informative, although much of the information I already knew. It did not add much to what has been written before. I think I was expecting more.Since many of the premises were repeated continually, it seemed like this book was an effort to take an interesting article or thesis and make it into a book. It could have been much shorter."
3,Very interesting film but not a masterpeice,"Heater is indeed a very interesting Canadian film, but it isn't all that great.Overall, the film isn't all that much and seemed to take two years to film (you can tell at one point, because we see Sat Dec 13). Also not to mention that the film is very provactive (containing like 40 F-words). What the film is about, are these two poor guys (one a homeless guy (Ouimette), another on the verge of becoming homeless (Gary Farmer)). Ouimette finds a heater one day and tries selling it out on the streets. When trying to sell it at the shelter he's kicked out with his new partner (Farmer) for like a day.When Farmer finally suggests they return it (after discovering a receipt was tucked in the inner package), a barage of clumbsy acts occur. And then in the end the story ends rather sadly.If you like documentry films, this movie is for you. If you like mystery films, you might want to pass or at least rent it first."
2,"Acceptable content, poor quality print.","I purchased the ""Bach Remedies Workbook"" to learn more about the Bach remedies for self diagnosis and treatment of others. This book covers a great deal of material pertaining to symptom recognition and learning which remedies apply to each. The book is comprehensive and set up like a true workbook.The problem is that the quality of the paper and print is the worst I have ever seen. The paper is almost like newsprint paper. There are blocks of information / notes with a dark gray background. The print is not dark enough and is barely readable.The illustrations are cheesy too.I don't recommend this book because it is difficult to read (physically) in many places, which is too bad, because the content is better than average."
2,Bumptious,"I have been trying to find a CD set that would do justice to the Haydn London symphonies. I had the highest hopes for Bruggen, having heard snatches on the radio and admiring his amiable, casual, free approach in these bits. Now with the set, I'm angry at the purchase. Yes, Bruggen is amiable, casual and free, but totally unrefined. It is as if he assembled his gifted players, started them off, and left the room. There is no exploration from phrase to repeat, no delicacy of shading, no interpretation. This music is great but it cannot speak for itself. I also find Davis cheerful but interpretively weak. My hopes now rest with Dorati or Kuijken."
5,Classic Bill Evans,"Evans at his introspective best. The 15"" ""Never Let Me Go"" is among his more remarkable recordings. There three different issues of this session, hard to decide which is best ."
2,Review,I found this book to be a bit of a slow read. I had hoped for a lot more exciting personal battle accounts gleaned from the battalion's veterans.
4,a quality black metal album,"First off, these songs stay with you. I regretted trading my copy to a friend until I recently got it back. Amazingly enough, I still knew most of the rhythms and notes after not hearing it for half a year. Also, it's very refreshing to hear something besides ""satan is great"" or ""go out and kill people"" executed very well in times when few can. That type of music(Dark Funeral, goatwhore,gorgoroth) does have its place in the scene, but it gets old after a while. Highly recommended."
3,"Good, but.........","The opening track to this album, 'Genuine Pulse' is one of the most majestic, powerful black metal anthems ever (perhaps next to Emperor's 'With Strength I Burn'). After such a wonderful opening the rest of the album is somewhat of a letdown. It sounds so atmospheric (the production really is amazing) but Borknagar just lack a knockout punch. The album also becomes quite same-ish. 'Matter and Motion' is a twisted carnival-esque metal piece built around a keyboard solo. It makes me think of Arcturus' 'Star Crossed' but Arcturus do it much better. Vintersorg's clean vocals are excellent but his harsh vocals tend to lack expression and variation. I haven't heard any other Borknagar albums but this album I would describe as a near miss, so I would still be keen to hear some more."
5,Impressive,"An well done impressie album by borknagar. This guys can realy play and i assure you that you wouln'd be disapointed if you purchase this album. The best track ? mmm i have to say "" genuine pulse"" such an classic song. Buy it !"
1,OVERRATED,"This CD I thought would be pretty decent, but is not a worthy CD in Black Metal. This band isn't bad at all but I personally didn't care for the sound this release had. The only song that caught my attention is the first track(The Genunine Pulse)which is a decent song but sounds a bit to radio friendly for my tastes. I GIVE IT ONE STAR FOR THE FIRST SONG AND FOR THE FACT AMAZON WON'T ALLOW A ZERO STAR RATING."
2,Too bad delivery,Hey men !what's up too long delay. wait from february and now in May still waiting until july !!Hope that you give me a discount for items due to the lack of buisness.
4,stunning first book,"While not as good as her second or third book (she really grew as a poet), Rhina Espaillat's first book is a great debut. She has mastered meter and rhyme and does it so seemlessly and beautifully you don't even notice it happening. You also find a few poems in her native Spanish (untranslated). And some simple drawings, also by the poet. Espaillat is one of my favorite poets and this is a worthy collection by her."
3,Christmas with Flicka,"Frederica's voice is beautiful as always. She journeys to the Alpine village of St. Wolfgang to rediscover a childhood Christmas memory. The story line is a bit weak, nevertheless, her devotion and charm are quite evident."
4,"Loved the movie, ok quality!","Perhaps not the fault of the company, but the quality wasn't great. The movie came out a long time ago-but enjoyed the movie and story."
1,5 stars for movie minus 10 for editing,"I loved this movie ever since I first saw it. So, when I finally found the DVD, I was excited to see it again. But as I watched it, I was so dissappointed at the scenes either cut short or removed. Scenes deleted include Mattie finding Ms Eva dead, Basil complaining about the prision conditions, the kids going to see the play, Theresa helping the little girl who fell, and the ""meatloaf incident"". Other scenes are cut short. This DVD definitely disappointed."
1,A total RIP-OFF!!,"I was a kid when this movie came out on t.v. I can't count the # of times I've watched it and I can remember it like the back of my hand... I'm heartbroken at the way this movie was put together! Where are all of the important scenes in this movie!!? The DVD isn't even worth buying because of all the deleted scenes!! This movie is a classic and now has been completely butchered!! The editing in the film is crappy to say the least...black screens show up where the original scene should have been...this DVD version is not good at all!! Whoever was in charge of editing and releasing this film did this film a major injustice...I waited so long for this film to FINALLY be released on DVD and sadly, I am really disappointed...for those who are familiar w/ the film, don't waist your hard earned $$ on this movie..."
1,Read Reviews Before Purchasing!,"I am highly disappointed with Amazon; they usually sell such quality products, but this was a disaster. I grew up watching the original 2 VHS set; the movie was that long. So once I saw it was put on DVD, I was ecstatic and didn't even bother reading the reviews. If I had taken the extra 2 seconds to, I wouldn't have spent my money on it. There were critical scenes deleted, when I swore that movies put into DVD format were supposed to offer MORE, not TAKE AWAY. If you have never seen the movie, then I guess it's no problem, but if you are like me who used to curl on the couch with my mother and laugh cry get angry along with the characters, then DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CRAPPY DVD."
2,I am very disappointed with the deleted scenes!!,"I remember my mother having the 2 tape VHS movie in her collection. I've watched this movie so many times that I know the scenes verbatim. I was excited to see that it was finally on DVD, but once I got it home and watched it, I was disappointed at how many scenes had been deleted. When Mattie finds Miss Eva had passed on...Basil in jail...the play at the community center, and my favorite ""the meatloaf scene"". I would have much rather bought the VHS set. Please read the reviews of other buyers who feel the same way I do before you make your choice."
1,how can I exchange it?,"The middle of the movie stops and I couldn't fast forward it, how can I exchange it for another one?"
1,Cut so many parts of this version!,I have this version and I was so disappointed when I got it! They cut so many parts of the movie it's a shame! Don't buy this version go and purchase the uncut version that will be released Feb. 2011! That's what I did!Women of Brewster Place: Original Uncut Version
4,This movie was a Christmas gift,I bought this movie as a Christmas gift for a friend who loves this film. My friend was delighted to receive it and I hope she will also enjoy seeing it again.
2,Buyer beware!,"This is one of my favorite movies, but this version has cut out so many scenes that it jumps like a bad bootleg it's not worth the price you pay. I'm now on a hunt to find the full version of this movie if anyone has come across it please let me know."
1,smokymtnbooks sucks!!!!!,"i never recieved my product from smokymtnbooks, they shipped it on 12-23-09 and i still have not recieved it. so, don't order from these people, they are bad,bad, bad business people. also, unless you have money to burn don't order from them. shame on you smokymtnbooks for taking advantage of a paying customer. shame,shame,shame. and,they didn't give me a refund basically told me i was on my own. shame."
3,Women Of Brewster Place,"I read all the reviews before purchasing the DVD so as the old saying goes you cant be mad at what you already know. It was refreshing to view this Old Favorite of mine inspite of the scenes that were cut. Nevertheless, I still enjoyed watching this film as I heard the sounds of Vesta Williams during the introduction so what's not to like about that right!"
1,Thanks for the warning,Like most of you out there I have been searching for this movie on DVD for years now. Thank God I have the movie on VHS which was purchased by my grandmother who brought the movie when it first came out. I fell in love with this movie when I first watched it and I wanted to add it to my collection of DVD's. When I read the reviews about it been cut up and major scenes being deleted I was so disappointed. So I guess I have to hang on to my VCR a little longer than I wanted. Thanks!
1,DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!!!,"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU BUY!! GO BACK AND SEARCH FOR THE UNCUT VERSION AS THIS VERSION CUTS OUT SOME OF THE MOST IMPORTANT SCENES!! I AM SO MAD BECAUSE I ORDERED THIS IN OCTOBER & AM JUST NOW OPENING AND WATCHING TO FIND THAT THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT VERSION... UGH SO UPSET.. SO I AM GOING TO ORDER THE UNCUT VERSION NOW AND JUST PASS THIS ONE ALONG TO MY MOTHER!!! LOVE THE MOVIE, BUT THIS IS NOT THE VERSION YOU ARE LOOKING FOR AND DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY IT IS BEING OFFERED!!"
2,kristen's super cool review,"This movie doesn't live up to the book. The characters emotions are downplayed and the details are barely there. The movie left out a lot of information the book provides. The movie left out some very important scenes, such as the one that shows how spoiled Basil is by his mom. I think the movie depicted the characters the same way as the book, but did a poor job presenting the movies different scenes."
3,The movie in comparison to the book,"In the book ""Women of Brewster Place"" the auther gives the image of a young man named Butch Fuller. The auther explains this character in a way that shows why Mattie is attracted to him. You see that it is merely a physical attraction to Butch and the way he presents himself because her family thinks of Butch as a ""Low-down ditch dog."" In the movie it is very hard to undertand Matties attraction because Butch does not present himself in a manner at all resembling the character in the book. He seems to present himself more like a ""Low-down ditch dog."""
4,A must see,This is a depressing movie but it's also beautiful at the same time. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
2,brewsters place,The movie the women of brewsters place was a bad movie because there needed to be better acting and casting. It seemed to jump from one scene to the next without having any conection. I thught that it might not have made as much sence if you hadn't read the book which is bad because it should be its own story and not read another one to be able to understand it.
5,This movie was good,"I liked The Women of Brewster Place. It was a nice movie. I never read the book, but the movie is touching, especially if you are a mother."
2,The Brewster joke,The Women of Brewster Place is a good book but then when you go to see the movie they made on the book you see the movie is a joke. In the book Mattie the main character has a rough time dealing with the baby until she met this one special person named MIss Eva who takes them under her wing. In the book Miss Eva is viewed as a loving caring friend that wants to help Mattie and the baby but in the jokeful movie Miss Eva doesn't give any real likingness to Mattie which destroys everything the book had said. Each character in the movie did a poor job in bringing the book's characters to life. the Depth of the book did not come out in the movie which to me made it a complete and total joke.
3,A little disappointed,"I really love the story line. I have admired this movie for years. I have it in VCR, copied from the television version. However, i was disappointed in that the voice was not in sync with the actors. As I continued to watch the movie, it became rather irritating. I was anxiously awaiting its arrival and was a little disappointed to discover the out of sync ""version"" of the movie."
3,A movie for my collection,good movie. Oprah is one of my favorite actresses. So I collect her movies. I think this was a used dvd. it came in good condition.
1,No offense to Oprah.,"Oprah, performance excellant, The movie from this store was Thumbs downcause of quality and the blurry and fuzziness of the movie.The store whom sent this needs to review their movies for quality."
5,Go Oprah,"Loved this movie, don't know why I waited so long to get it. Will be watching this over and over. Would recommentd this movie to everyone. It's worth every pennie."
3,SHAME ON THE DISTRIBUTOR OF THIS FILM,"This is one of the best films about black women. I was very happy to see that it was finally a DVD. The DVD version is chopped up something terrible. Many of the scenes have been deleted. When movies are made into DVD, as a rule, there are many extras added. Often times the deleted scenes are part of the DVD. Don't buy the DVD unless you've never seen this movie before. Otherwise, you'll be disappointed."
2,"SHAME ON YOU, AMAZON!","Certainly, this film is excellent. However, the version sold here is incomplete. Several key scenes are missing including Cora and her children at _Midsummer Night's Dream_ and the infamous meatloaf scene. One of the only drawbacks of our new virtual world is that you must buy something and open it before you find out it's not what you wanted. There are two versions sold here; I bought the more expensive one, thinking it would be more comprehensive. Buy the cheaper one! You can't miss more than I've missed."
1,Now you done made me mad,"I remember watching this made for TV movie a few years ago. However I was disappointed with the DVD. You can actually see where it was sliced and diced.Some parts in particular: Oprah finds Ms. Eva to be ""asleep"" after Ms. Eva did not pick up the kids after school. Oprah returns to the house with the kids. She calls out Ms. Eva name several times. Once Oprah touches her, she realizes that Ms. Eva has passed.Then there were obvious cuts where there was nothing but a blank screen. Another cut scene: Basil was in jail and Oprah came to visit. ""Basil don't you want to sit and talk for a spell? No mama, unless you came to bail me out I have nothing to say"", or something to that effect.This was a hard to find DVD and I was thoroughly disappointed by it. It would have been nice to view the movie in its entirety but I didn't get that."
1,I got Shafted!!!!,"When this movie came on T.V. many years ago, I recorded it, edited out the commercials and everything. So when it finally was released on D.V.D. I jumped at the chance to have a better quality version.I even gave my V.H.S. copy to my mother. Man, was I ever disappointed, the movie is missing critical scenes. Too many to even describe in this review!! I thought because [...] that that was the problem, but after reading so many other reviews that basically are saying the same thing, I can see I wasn't the only one who got shafted.And to make things worse, my mother won't give me the V.H.S. version back!!!"
3,Not The Women Of Brewster Place I remember,"I saw this movie when it originally was broadcast during a two day period. I had waited for years for the video version. I missed the chance to see it a few years ago. When the DVD version came out I leaped at the chance to own one of my all time favorite movies. Unbeknownst to me, the movie was COMPLETELY butchered. In fact some of the BEST scenes were deleted from the DVD version. The movie works best for those who are unfamiliar with the original version.I am so disappointed that I bought this DVD. Too many key scenes are missing. It's still a well acted and enjoyable film. Excellent performances:Most noticably, Robin Givens, Jackee, Paula Kelly(strong, feisty and hot tempered Teresa) and Olivia Cole(as the nosey, gossiping Miss Sophie."
3,Not want I wanted,"Why do they put the movie on dvd and cut some of the good parts out of the movie? I thought I found this movie, but I was a sucker."
1,Wow!!! What A Disaster,"Thanks to the other reviewers who warned of this horrible dvd. Such a fine movie deserves A+ treatment. Hopefully the movie will be re-released with widescreen, total digital restoration, and bonus features. Even though it was made for t.v. it still should be done right."
1,Thank you all,"Thank you all for your reviews. I was searching for this movie and almost purchased this copy until I read the reviews you all posted. This is a wonderful movie and worthy of anyones collection. But the fact that key scenes have been edited out is a shame. I loved the passion of the women in this movie, and the acting is top notch. But all the scenes need to be there to fully experience the wonders of this epic tale."
1,This movie is horrible in comparison to the book,Mattie Michael the main character was not presented well. She seemed fakr; not what a real person would be like. Esspecailly in the scene where Mattie meets Butch. In the book the events in the scene flow together nicely. It had a lot of details and great descriptions. But in the movie the scene wasn't presented well. The events in the scene didn't flow together well. The two characters also don't look very real. The conversation they have looks rehearsed. Plus the reactions and facail expressions don't seem as real during the scene as they do in the book. The way Mattie was acting looked pretty fake and rehearsed. All in all the acters did a poor job presenting the characters they way they were from the book
1,This is a LIE! This NOT the complete uncut version!,"I just bought this DVD, and they are lying! I just watched the first 30 minutes, and I already noticed TWO scenes missing! The scene where Matty finds Miss Eva on the couch is NOT in this DVD. The scene where Matty talks to Basil in prison is not on this DVD either! I want my money back! I trusted this version to be complete. Why are you cheating people and lying to them. Un-wrapped or not, I am returning this DVD. I am very disappointed too, because I was waiting for this classic to be released in its full complete version for a long time. I have seen the full version twice before )plus read the book). I hate it when customers are cheated. If you are looking for the full version, THIS IS NOT IT."
3,A great movie...despite the cuts!!!!,"I was one those fortunate enough to remember the entire series and I was throughly excited to get this on DVD, however as I began to watch it and remembering it as I went along, I noticed that there were a couple of scenes deleted from the DVD. Most notably, the scene where Cora Lee takes her children to see ""A Midsummer's Night Dream"". I was also disappointed that there were no extras. I would still suggest that you purchase it for the sheer brillance of the story and performances, but If you remember the original, those deleted scenes might be an issue for you."
3,HEY...QUESTION....????,Has anyone ever bought this movie on VHS through amazon? and if so is that version chopped up too?
1,Oprah Can't Act,"I think that the acting in this movie was not very good. Oprah could not capture the essence of Matty. Her facial features did not look realistic. She couldn't give a clear picture the way the book did. The movie, I think, left out alot of important detail. For example the movie does not show Baisil being spoiled. It did not show how he got away with everything. In the book Baisil comes down stairs, after washing, and Mattie was going to send him back and wash again, but Baisil kissed her on the cheek and said ""I love you mom"" and she let him stay. I think Baisil not being punnished is the reason why he becomes a rotten kid."
2,I Loved The Movie Not The Dvd,well i brough the movie 2wice the 1st time after the 1st time i seen the movie during mothers day 1 year i brough the tape 2 notice like every1 else some parts of the movie was missing then i brough the dvd yesterday and i was so upset i figure since it was the dvd that all da movie would b there and on top of that the dvd barely works its keep skipping i've cleanin it so many times only 1hr of the movie dosent skipp the movie iz good i read both the book and watched the movie i think oparah did a great job despite what ppl think i loved the movie i rather tape it off of tv then buy the movie i wonder what oparah thinks about it or does she even kno about how the dvd is i think she should all gives us working dvds with all the extra stuff once again great movie bad editing and dvd so i hope this help u outVictoria GGreensboro Nc
3,Power recepticle placement could be better,"I agree with the previous reviewer, but since a lot of smaller laptops have an inadequate power supply, it is what you have to live with. I just with they put the recepticle for the male plug in a better location. A smaller subminature plug is called for in the center of those 4 ports !"
4,Worked out great as a replacement for my busted USB laptop ports,"This worked great for me. If I had to have one complaint it would be nice if the power supply could come from existing USB port (vs an AC adapter), but since I'm just using it for a USB mouse I don't need the external usb power supply anyway."
4,Proof reading,Although the story was really good if found a lot of spelling mistakes and sometimes that made the story hard to follow.
3,Winter Woman,"Not a very well written book, I have not read any other books by this author and more than likely will not. Did not have much to do with a Winter Woman. I have a hard time reading a book about women in the wilderness but this one was really hard to read."
1,Disappointed in HP product,"The product did not work constantly in my HP Laserjet 2420. When powering up the printer sometimes jobs will print and sometimes nothing. The Error code 49XXXX would show up periodically when printing was not working. Web Jetadmin was not able to fix or trouble shoot the problem. The USB port acts similar to the Jetdirect card, they both work intermittently. The problem is either with the printer or the Jetdirect card. The Jetdirect card is the first HP product that has not worked well. I will definitely look at other manufacturers products when purchasing a new printer. The Jetdirect card is still in the printer and when time permits again, another attempt to fix the product will be attempted. Until the problem is fixed, the printer works fine when the parallel port is used."
1,It's a Lemon!,"Says it's new, but it doesn't work. Someone from another department had another one, popped it in, worked like a charm. Tried this one again, nothing. Hopefully they will just give me my money back."
1,Ugh,"Got this book as a gift. Great cover, interesting topic...dud of a book. Oh well, it was a thoughtful gift nonetheless.Unfortunately, this book is less the story of the X-1 and more a case study in government and engineering beaurocracy at work. I made it halfway through the first chapter, until the author pointed out that the specs brought to the March 15-17, 1945 meetings didn't meet the required ""flight capability as stipulated at the December 20-21 meeting between Bell and ATSC,"" because ""the proposed design would carry a total fuel load of 6,740 pounds of propellant""...well, that's when I realized that this book is a regurgitation of meeting minutes, contracts, and technical data. There may be a story somewhere in 318 pages--but I can't find it. Ugh.I'm sure the Smithsonian had good reason for publishing this book. I just can't figure out a good reason for reading it."
5,A Well-Kept Secret Discovered,"I bought this solely on the strength of ""Please Don't Tell Her"" and after never really delving into the remainder, put it aside. A recent road trip required a recycling of my main car CD fare and I threw this into the mix. It caught my ear, my attention, and still remains. I had not sampled any of their other efforts, but after continous play of this, I have looked and discovered the quality of their work here extends to other offerings.... Great sound, excellent instrumental sides and a package that works...and works very well. I still get a raised eyebrow or curious look from others when they hear something I'm playing from here, ask who the artist is, and I reply ""Big Head Todd and the Monsters""....Not sure if they go out later and discover what I did, or assume I'm pulling their leg..Their loss if they don't. This is extremely good stuff..."
5,Every cut is a hit!,No single album can match this unique artist's abilty to make you feel a part of each and every song. Zappacosta is a superb showman. A chance to see him in person should not be missed.
5,Music To Inspire,"This is a great compilation CD that is great for the car to sing to, inspire by, and be joyous in!!!"
4,All that's missing is Sinatra,What a fun listen. I play it at casual dinner parties for bavkground music and it makes people smile. For some reason one of the Sinatra songs in the movie is not included...too bad.
4,Soaring feel good soundtrack with poor recording quality,"Top performers in all musical genres lined up to give us a great, feel-good soundtrack that's more memorable than the movie. Don Henley opens up with inspiring ""Through your Hands."" Another Texan, Willie Nelson, offers his own take on Louis Armstrong's, ""What a Wonderful World."" Overall, the music will get you on your feet and lift your spirits--and what could be more angelic than that???"
2,Not complete - so sad,"I really loved this film, had to have my own copy, and have watched it many times with just as much enjoyment. It's a true feel good movie. So, I wanted to have the soundtrack. But, this isn't a true soundtrack. It has only some of the music in the film. It doesn't even have Andie MacDowell singing ""Pie,"" which is what I really wanted. I won't be buying this one."
1,Where is Sinatra?,"Why use Frank Sinatra's ""I Thought About You"" in the movie and then not release it on the soundtrack??"
4,Michael the music,"I found the CD mildly disappointing in that the music played in the background by Chet Atkins was not included on the soundtrack. However, the music that is included is very good!"
1,Sent my blood sugar through the roof!,"These cookies taste OK. You're not going to mistake them for regular cookies, but they're good enough. They're about the size of a quarter. My type 2 diabetes is well controlled and I rarely have numbers over 130 anymore even after a meal. I ate just six of these cookies and my count shot up to 200! I could have eaten a couple of much larger and tastier ""normal"" cookies and not had a reading that high. So, if you want to try these, don't buy a large supply until you are sure they won't do the same thing to you."
1,"Lemon Cookies are OK, but no so for Pecan Shortbread","I tried to email my complaint to the address printed on the package, but that email is no longer active, then I called the number listed, asking for the new address and a call back .... NONE CAME !I opened a bag of Pecan Shortbread (no date code listed on the package), it smelled rancid ... and stale ... and out of one of the cookies, a long hair pertruded. Had to take the microscope to find any resemblence of crushed pecans or even the slightest nutty taste. Suffice it to say, this product is just plain aweful.Can't mess up on Lemon ... but because of my experience, I've asked World Market to stop selling the Pecan Shortbread. I sure won't buy any more."
4,Nice Cookies,"I thought these were good for a sugar free cookie. There is no sugar free after taste, but they do seem a little bland. I think these will be better with a nice cup of coffee. They are very crispy and light and you don't need alot to be satisfied.....you actually will pay for it if you over indulge ;)"
1,Dangerous and Defective,These tongs are defective and dangerous! The handles are metal and the edges where they meet when you compress the tongs are sharp. This acts basically like a pair of scissors. If you are using this utensil to cook (as it is marketed) you risk cutting off your finger tips if you aren't very careful. My husband and I both cut our hands several times before we threw them away. I have a friend who has a pair who had the same problem. Very dangerous!!! Do not buy this product!!!!!
2,Great for short term use,"I've had this product for about a year. I still use it, but the silicone is tearing apart and the locking mechanism doesn't work anymore. If you don't care about durability or longevity, you might like these tongs."
2,agreed - silicone doesn't last,"However, neither did the silicone on my Oxo silicone tongs, I think they make the inside metal too sharp so after awhile any pressure on it causes the metal to cut through the silicone cover. It's a shame, because I really liked these tongs and didn't have the problem of catching my fingers in between the tongs and finding them sharp, they lasted about 3 years for me. At $20 that's not a very good life span."
4,Adequate till I get an HDTV,"This converter is adequate if it's for a temporary fix or great if you're looking to play your console games on your computer monitor. I'm actually getting an HDTV soon, but couldn't resist the temptation of getting a PS3 for the new Madden 11, so this converter would do. The resolution is, however, somewhat of a let down. It's blurry and not sharp. So, if you're looking to test your next-gen console's graphics ability DO NOT GET this converter. But, if you're on a budget, DO get this converter rather than spending another 6-8 grand on a decent next-gen HDTV.The good thing is I definitely will hook up my older consoles to it and play them on my good ol' monitor."
4,Does what is says it does.,"This product's design does exactly what it advertises and that's what I needed. Ive had no problems with product flaws from the factory. My scenario is xbox1, computer and VCR using the Multi-input box inputs for video input to an LCD VGA computer monitor. This device has only one audio TRS 3.5mm output jack. The TRS jack is tight up against the VGA input plug when both are being used. There is some tweaking necessary for each components output due to the limitations of RCA video to VGA. So degradation is seen but for my situation I am not needing top of the line video. Depending on what type of monitor you use that itself can greatly enhance the image from the VGA box. I am completely satisfied with this product."
4,Works just fine,"I've had no problems with the device so far. Aspect ratio distortion is non-existent on my wide-screen monitor.Only real con I found is that there is no on/off switch and hence it continually pumps signal (blank signal) even when everything else is turned off. The simple solution I have is just unplugging it when I'm done. Not a big hassle for me, could be inconvenient for others."
5,Love this little box!,"I needed this device because I have a monitor that only had a VGA input. After hooking up my,PC, XBOX 360, PSP2,and a VCR to use as a tuner, I can now use this monitor for all. I did find that sometimes the picture was not great but there's a button located on the front to change the resolution between 640 x 480 @ 60Hzor 75Hz, 800 x 600 @ 60Hz or 75Hz, and 1024 x 768 @ 60Hz. After pressing this button you can pick which screen looks best. For someone who wants to use their monitor for more than just the PC this is a Great thing to have!"
2,Poor Graphic but it will do!,Ok so i purchased this VGA Box. It works and it has the nifty channels so you dont have to go through the whole uynplugging and replugging. However the graphics are ok..nothing that makes me say yeahhh! it may be my monitor its a Samsung..i dont really know i wish i could have tried it first without buying it. But it does work and i will get over the fgraphics issue
4,Better than I expected...but not as good as it could be...,"I got this to hook my Gamecube to my computer monitor as I had given away my TV and it does exactly that. It displays an image on my computer monitor from my Gamecube. I am very happy with my purchase and will be enjoying my Gamecube once again.edit: after playing with it for a while I realized the minimum OUTPUT I was able to make it produce is 800x600. And surprisingly it will output up to my monitors native resolution of 1920x1200. However, I cannot get it to output the same resolution that my GameCube does, which is 640x480, so I will just have to live with a slightly blurry image. If it would output the same resolution as I'm putting into it, it would be a much better product as I could then play with a crystal clear image.I am glad I can play without needing a TV in my very small room. But it could be better."
3,"Does a decent job, but doesn't work with everything.","This does a decent job of displaying Wii or PS2 on a VGA monitor.However, it's not compatible at all with the Super Nintendo (Which, to be fair, it doesn't say that it supports it.).If you plug in an SNES, it causes the unit to freeze solid. Displaying a still image of whatever is onscreen.Which is odd, because video-is-video right?Somehow the video output of the SNES causes the system to lockup hard core... bummer..."
4,"Good, but doesn't work with Sega Genesis","Works well, nice that it has multiple input channels. However, it doesn't work with some of the older consoles like sega genesis."
3,Sorta Works,This product does what it claims. But using the audio connections at the back caused a buzzing noise in the speakers. Just using it for video connections is fine.
3,Not great but it will do,"If your looking for a way to play a console on your PC monitor then get this but don't expect HD. This thing look very blurry on my monitor [with every system i use, its all the same] and text is nearly illegible."
3,Somewhat misleading features,"The box works as designed. That said, it was designed rather poorly. It doesn't have resolution support for widescreen monitors. This is an annoyance, but a clear oversight on the people who designed the thing. There doesn't seem to be a place for inputting PC sound either. So while I can toggle between my wii and my computer, if I want my computer to have sound, I have to get down on my knees and re-configure the thing. It defeats the purpose of having a box that takes in my PC as input if I have to configure the thing anyway everytime I switch, no?Anyway, aside from these, the thing works as designed. Everything is in standard 4:9 proportions, but it works with no static and with seemingly no loss."
4,"Probably just a personal problem, but still","Getting a VGA adapter that can handle about 4 game systems for less than $50 is clearly a deal. The fact that one can save the money on a having to buy an LCD TV by using their monitor instead only adds to the savings. However, I have a problem when it comes to my monitor (a 19"" LG Flatron LCD). When I switch to PC mode, the image is fuzzy and soft, and in general not nearly as crisp or clear as when the AV adapter is not the one rerouting the signal from the computer to the monitor. Plus, when playing a game systemo on such a monitor, the image doesn't take up the whole screen, resulting in black borders on the left and right sides. If these problems could just be fixed though, it would be an exceptional product. Until then, it only gets a 4 from me."
5,These work GREAT!,"At first glance, i was a little dubious because these kinds of devices are, usually, a bit flaky...especially the ones coming out of China. However, in this case, i was WELL pleased. I hooked my Nintendo Wii, my Xbox 360, my PlayStation 2 & 3 all into my VGA Viewsonic monitor and they look great.It was an all-around great buy."
3,Not Much!,"with my monitor LCD lg L17527x-sf, the vga box it was not what hoped ,the image is blurred it is worse than the TV,I do not recommend it to use it with playstation 2,I am disappointed"
2,"Functional, but barely...","Overall quality of this thing is pretty poor. It doesn't even have a power switch, so you just have to unplug it to turn it off. The video quality from my playstation 2 is terrible on my 19 inch lcd, blurred and somewhat distorted. The picture actually looks much better on my old cheap tv set. I've toyed around with monitor settings and even tried a different vga cable, but couldn't get any significant improvements. Unless you just dont care about picture quality, you should continue your search. This device wont give you what your looking for."
2,If you can see in the dark....,This box should definitely not be used for PS3/Xbox 360. If you have a LCD Widescreen monitor it is much better to get cables that have a VGA/DVI output. That will get you your crisp image. I tested this box on my Gamecube. It works. But for some reason the gameplay is dark...REALLY DARK. I tried adjusting my monitor brightness but that doesn't have any effect at all (MGS: Twin Snakes). Of course you aren't going to get the best graphics out of this but playing games that are near pitch black isn't what I wanted. Hoping to return this.
3,its ok,this is ok product does what it suppose to but i have used only 1 time so not sure about details
5,I love this box,"I had an old monitor from '04 laying around collecting dust, and I decided to put it to good use. I decided to see if there existed a product to connect a video game system to a computer monitor. I discovered this VGA box. Its just what I needed.. You can hook up 4 systems (I myself have 3 I want to use with this) and just a button to switch between them. It displays picture fine, I can't really tell if any quality is lost or anything, but to me it looks great. Set-up was easy, I just needed an audio cable, which I had laying around. I notice no lag or interference in audio or video, I'm completely satisfied with this. The only negative thing I can find is that the picture isn't perfectly centered when I switch inputs (probably half an inch of black space on one of the sides), but my monitor can auto-adjust it to center with a button press so it's really not a problem for me. I'm now back to playing some classic video games, I couldn't be happier with this product."
2,Update: The Holy Grail,"After months of searching, I used this to hook my N64 up to my computer and it worked wonderfully! That was, for the first four months. Last week I went to use it, and it didn't allow me to switch channels - it was completely broken. I e-mailed the manufacturer about it, and they told me that there is no solution to the problem, and that they no longer make the product. It sounds like this is a common defect! Amazon kindly issued me a refund, but what I really wanted was for this thing to work! It was my bridge back to my childhood. Back to square one."
1,Just a useless piece of garbage that does not work,This is just a useless piece of garbage that does not work.The drivers do not install and there is nothing to see in the menu.The unit is not functional and cannot recognize any media streams.
1,Sound problems,"The biggest problem I had with this device is that after an hour of recording, the sound and video do not sync. I didn't have the problem on shorter videos, but when you're trying to get dozens of 2 hour home videos on to the computer, it's a big problem. I had to capture sound as a separate file, take the sound file into another software package, stretch it out to match the video, then recombine it with the video.Rather than return the product, I worked around the problem because I tried multiple other products, including Dazzle's video capture devices, and one by Roxio, and they all had worse problems. I used this thing for a few weeks, let it sit for a couple of months, then it didn't work after that. Waste of money. But like I said, I've tried a bunch of different devices and none of them seem to work well."
1,Can I send back for credit?,Video Express purchased. Is not compatible with my computer. Can I return and get a refund? How do I return?
1,Terrible device,"This device does not work. I spent ages trying different software and running troubleshooting tests, and the bottom line is that this device is manufactured in such a way that it does not draw enough power from the USB port to keep the video and audio in sync.And no, it's not a problem with my processor being slow, and yes, I use USB 2.0, and yes, I have repeatedly tweaked my software capture settings. But this device cannot keep video and audio in sync. The only way to do it is to set software to drop video frames in order to sync up the audio. And take a wild guess what happens then. Yup, super-choppy video.I will probably try to use this to record my audio cassettes onto my computer to convert to mp3s, but this is all the device MAY BE good for, and that remains to be seen."
1,I had the same problem...,"Just like ""Dean"" below...I bought my unit a couple years back, and now...it doesn't work at all. USB ports don't recognize it, and if you try and fire it up....XP crashes (blue screen.)I guess to sum it up...this was a 'planned obsolescence' unit. Like Dean, I won't be giving any more money to these folks. Nice try...but we figured you out."
1,The Company,"I would advise strongly against purchasing anything from the Company which produces this device. I purchased the older version of this capture device about 2 years ago. The device worked really well, it was easy to use and the quality was good. I don't use it very often but it comes in handy. The problem is, these People have pulled a trick which causes any older version to simply not function, causing you, in theory to purchase their latest version. Seeing as how I don't use this very much and I would like something that would still function a couple of years from now, when I do buy another it won't be from them. Sorry ADS."
1,Not Vista Compatible,"The capture software that comes with it causes vista to crash. Got it to capture through Nero but nothing that was viewable. This is my second effort at capturing, after Dazzle didn't work even with XP. Luckily i got this with my credit card reward points and didn't pay out of pocket. Hopefully they'll come out with a Vista patch, since they advertised that it worked with Vista."
1,does not work,"I thought this device was going to work with my Ulead Video Studio 10, the driver did not work with my Video Editing software...needless to stay this was a total wast of money. get a 1394EE cable instead of this piece of crap."
2,Works Sometimes,"I had another ADS Tech unit which worked great. But it has a firewire connection, and when I had to change to a computer w/o Firewire, I wanted another unit with USB out. So I bought this one.I finally got it to work, but it's very finicky. It only works with their own capture software (Media TV Monitor) and even then only when all the stars are aligned. I was hoping my previous experience with ADS Tech would carry over, but not this time.(I'm using MS Vista. So yes it works with Vista--sometimes.)"
2,USB Video Express,This device is not for digitizing VHS collections onto DVD. The software that comes with it uses digital image and video files that are already on your computer or your digital video camera and makes Windows media files for burning onto video CDs. These are animated slide shows with background music. However it does bring a poor quality video image from an analog device such as a VCR on to your desktop but I haven't found a way to store this information on the computer. The software that comes with it doesn't do this. Probably will need to get third party software but the image quality will be poor.
1,I can't give it zero stars,"This steaming pile of worthlessness cost us half a day. Will not install, root drivers don't work, locks up computer, interface is amateurish and incomprehensible, and to top it all off: it's not Vista compatible (even though the package says it is).Avoid like the plague."
1,This Does Not Work!,"This product does not work. I tried installing it on three different computers, and it either gave an error that it could not connect to the USB device, or simply crashed the computer. Don't buy this!"
2,Misleading . Not Vista Compatable!!!,"Packaging said vista supported. NOT!! Worked fine with Windows XP and Roxio Easy Media Creator, but I couldnt get the MUVEE software that came with it to work.The main reason I bought it was to use on my Vista O.S. Laptop because it has a faster setup, what a nightmare. The product caused my system to have a major crash everytime I tried to capture video. After countless hours trying to troubleshoot driver issues and searching the web for help, I got email from ADS tech telling me their are actually no Vista drivers yet for their product. What a joke.I have noticed that the website for the product has removed any mention of Vista compatability, and know I cant return the crap!"
4,Neuronal Physiology (1940-1968),"Physiology of Nerve Cells is based on Lecture Notes delivered at Johns Hopkins Medical School by Eccles himself. He decided to turn the notes into a concise paperback book. This is a paperback book by Sir John Eccles describing the early neuronal physiology of both sensory & motor neurons, with a mention and discussion of interneurons. There is a discussion of motoneuron loops involving muscle spindles. The writing is largely predicated on Eccles own work and innovations on motor control and physiology. This is the strongest aspect of the book. He discusses the Hodgkin-Huxley Models, the action potential, EPSPs, IPSPs, and other aspects of cellular neurobiology. His writing is dry in this book so the reader must sit down and read sections or blocks of the book at different times to obtain the full benefit. The discussion of ionic fluxes and neural homeostasis is outstanding. This is a very good book for students of neurobiology to own."
5,did great job,i bought this product site-unseen on amazon. i had terrible fungus on my ornamental trees because i live in a high humidity climate. it worked great! all the fungus is gone and my trees are thriving.
4,Great CD!,"This is an excellent CD for any country music fan. This CD is well worth the buy. The best songs are ""Amen Kind of Love"", and ""All Because of You."""
4,Children love it,"Our 11 and 6 year old grandchildren love this Haggadah. They are able to follow the order of the Seder and the Passover story. A note for the reviewer who stated ""Well it does not mention Moses at all."" In fact, Moses is not mentioned in any traditional Haggadah. This is deliberate because the Jewish people are discouraged from treating Moses as a diety."
5,Versatile Terry.........,"In addition to Larry Carlton, Terry has performed with Garth Brooks, Amy Grant, Ray Charles, Eric Clapton, Chet Akins & Michael W. Smith.My favorite on this CD is ""Ain't No Grave Gonna Hold My Body Down"". Such energy & anointing. I've seen him perform with no backup music or singers. Just his voice & harmonicas. Kept the crowd begging for more. You can catch him from time to time on Trinity Broadcasting Network programs. He has a great Christian testimony."
3,"OK, but...","I really recommend that if you like this CD you check out Todd Snider's ""Songs for the Daily Planet."" That album features tthe original, and superior, vewrsion of Somebody's Coming, and unlike this album manages to be spiritual without alienating non-christians. Both inspired, but Todd Snider's is inspiring."
5,Colorful and Engaging,"The mirrors in the book are a big hit, but my favorite part is the action your child is supposed to perform while watching his reflection in the mirror. It was fun, educational, and interactive for us. We were able to use this at several stages for my son, as he was learning to turn the pages, look at pictures, learning to read, learning to follow directions, and to find that reading is fun! I recommend this book!"
4,good buy,"cute--my daughter has liked this one since she was a few months old. Now she's 17 months, and still comes back to it. She now likes to copy the faces the characters are making"
3,Its okay,"The mirrors are okay, not the greatest but they work and serve their purpose. When reading the book to my child I do have to hold the book at an angle where he can see himself instead of the angle I would normally use to read a book.Also, in the book the cow is male. Since the traditional definition of a cow is a female bovine, I think it would be SMARTER to have the cow refered to as a she.But, my child loves the book."
2,"great concept, poor execution","My son, as most babies, loves mirrors so I thought this book would be great. However, the mirrors in this book are like fun house mirrors--the baby can't really see another baby face in it. He has received this book twice, and both have this problem. ALthough he likes the book, his favorite is another book with a ""clear"" mirror in it.Also, I'm not sure why some of the animals have names, and some are called by what they are. Odd.There are some Baby Einstein products that I love, but this is not one of them."
1,Mirror me a horrible mirror,"I am normally a big fan of the Baby Einstein products. My daughter loves the friendly animal graphics that accompany the series. When checking out the book, it seemed to have a great concept, especially since my daughter loves to mimic things. When we received the book today, I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the quality of the ""mirror"". There is a ""mirror"" on the cover and on each page of the book. The ""mirror"" severely distorts any image due to the way it is made and laid out on the page. It in no way presents an image like a true mirror. I do not know how a child would be able to decipher her own image making the suggested faces in the so-called ""mirror"". It might frighten her more than anything else. Thumbs down on ""Mirror Me"" for us. It's going back."
4,"Vibrant Pictures, Good for Babies","As with all Baby Einstein books, this one has incredibly colorful and vibrant pictures. A few other reviewers commented on the quality of the mirrors, they are thin reflective film with a 'fun house' effect, but the 0-9 month age group really isn't going to care. Each page features simple text for younger ones with a mirror. The back of the book has 3 tips and ideas for parents.The best way to encourage your child to read is to have books in the home."
4,Works great,"We use this cooker often and have no complaints. It looks good, too. Nice usable size and great for keeping things like chili hot at parties. Low temp is a little hot but usable. I was a little nervous because I had never heard of the brand ""Elite"". Recommended."
4,Sound meditation,"I ordered this book from a book club, and I'm glad I did. The title was interesting enough, and then I read it and couldn't wait to start my Spirit Singing practice! I've always been very inhibited, but this book shows you how to break through the barriers and open up and you learn how to express yourself and let your true voice come through. I'm interested in singing, and even though this isn't a voice training program, it shows you how to let go and not be afraid to sing. I also am interested in writing, and she does have a chapter on using this practice to write your own music. If you ever read ""The Artist's Way"" this is like Morning pages with sound! I just wish it came with a CD."
4,EXCELLENT CD,"After hearing Mr. Gogo on a movie soundtrack I looked him up on the internet and found a couple you tube videos of him. That caused me to buy this CD.I really like ""Vibe"" a lot. I don't give it five stars only because i was expecting a litle more uptempo rock sound and this is mostly a blues vehicle, but the songs are tight and the sound is really nice. The song ""Why don't you show me?"" is fantastic. It is one of those songs that you wish wouldn't end. I like this enough to buy more. Give it a try."
2,Lassitudes,"I had always wanted to read this book when I first heard about it. And it took me a while to get it. Because I have always liked the actor Will Patton from way back. But there is only one word to describe my experience with this booklet, and that is ""weird""."
1,Quandry,"The tablets arrived in a timely manner, but my cat refuses to eat them. I've tried giving them whole as treats, and disguising them ground in his favorite food. No luck! I would not purchase them again."
4,Pleasant Surprise,"I got this for one song (The Poontango) that I heard in a hilariously bad Troma film called Buttcrack, which he also had an acting role in. I really had no idea what kind of music Mojo Nixon made, so I was going in blind. What I got was something reminiscent of what Elvis would have made during a 3 day bender. I could sit around and listen to it on repeat for hours. Granted, it's not for everyone, but for people who want to let out their inner hillbilly, they should pick this up."
4,Mojo Nixon: America's Hick Hero,"Mojo Nixon, who has been ignored by the general public for a very very very long time, returns with a damn fine album that thumbs it's nose at everything corporate and embraces the hillbilly side of us all. Mojo, Elvis would be proud."
5,Mojo-rific should sum it all up... And it does!,"This is without a doubt a worthy addition to ANY mojoholics collection to the great one. This is a rocking collection of song that most mojoholics haven't heard... and it's about time. This is a SMASHING album, giving us hits like 'Bring me the head of David Geffen', to 'Tulane' (My favorite.) Although I like 'Root Hog or Die' better, this is my second, near first, favorite. GO GET IT!!"
2,Lukewarm at best...,"I won't bother with a synopsis of the book since one exists already so I'll cut to the chase. In a nutshell I thought the plot was confusing, character development weak, and the dialog was poor. And, as for the narrator, I've definitely heard better. The voice characterizations seemed amateur with the worst being the Director who sounded like Sam Eagle from the Muppets. Just awful. Yeah the book had some hi-tech gadgets but they were not enough to distract you from the failings of the book. And the timeline just doesn't work. If Charlie Dean is an ex-Marine sniper from Vietnam then he'd be pushing 60 years old. If I had to guess I'd say Stephen Coonts was maybe involved in the early development phase but likely did little of the ""heavy lifting"" (i.e. writing) and it shows. Not really a book I'd recommend but if you were stuck in an airport and had it handy it would do in a pinch."
1,My first and last Coonts novel,"I couldn't finish this book although I really tried. This was not well put together and I didn't care about any of the protagonists. I got this book on Audio and I'd like to know who came up with the voice of Reubens: who talks like that? He sounded like a pompous actor practicing A Shakespearian play, very unconvicing for the head of a spy operation. Lia was annoying, I like women that can take care of themselves but not her. Too many details where fewer were needed and too few details where more were needed. I could drift in and out of this book without feeling that I was missing anything."
1,My first and last Coonts,This is the first Stephen Coonts book I read and it will probably be the last. A big disappointment. It took me forever to finish this book. A few chapters held me captive but overall it was a pretty boring book. The high-tech gadgetry was very unbelievable.
2,poor,"The only reason I even finished this piece of trash is because I paid money for it. The basis of the story is good, but the execution was absolutely horrible. I kept waiting for some real action, but the real action never happened. This book belongs in the trash, but I may keep it on my bedside table to help me fall asleep on those sleepless nights, as it was one of the most pointless, boring books I have ever read. Because of this book, I may never read Coonts again."
1,Poor Quality,"I bought this step bar for my F-150. When I bought it, there was a 5 year warranty on it. It lasted 5 years and 10 months and rusted thru to the point that when I stepped on it to get in my truck, it broke off and fell to the ground. I called Westin customer service and they would not do anything for me on it. I understand that the warranty was up, but I would expect something to last more than 10 months past warranty. I'll never buy Westin again. Poor quality."
2,Good for wrist strength,They look cool and you can't beat the price; but they don't cut all that well. Good to have for lending to coworkers who lose tools.
1,Poorly made,The coating began peeling and flaking off of these cutters the very first time I used them to cut through light-gauge wire. I had to twist and struggle to get them to cut at all. Avoid this product and buy a real tool elsewhere.
5,Gospel Music?,"I had been searching for Goin' Up Yonder and He Keeps Doing Great Things for Me for years; the computer genius that I work with found it for me one night a few months ago on the internet. Couldn't find the singles so purchasing the CD was my means of obtaining the music I desired. The rating of this item, Inside Out, reflects my satisfaction with acquiring these 2 songs only. These 2 songs are among my favorite gosel songs."
3,Just okay,"I was glad to get my hands on a copy of this book. Unlike Cold Comfort Farm, however (which I read over and over again), I probably won't re-read this one. I didn't warm up to any of the characters. Still, Gibbons' wit and humor shines through in places, and there are garden parties, a memorable dress, moonlit drives, and holidays at seaside resorts - so if you like the 1930s, the language, settings and atmosphere of the novel will be of interest, anyway!"
5,Their songs soar even higher when experienced live.,"A beautiful collection celebrating 20 years of great music.Air Supply brings even more power and emotion to their music live in concert. Russell Hitchcock's amazing voice is in full force. It's wonderful to have their more recent songs on here as well, such as Someone, Goodbye and Always. Plus their remake of Unchained Melodody is the best I've heard that song performed. Anyone who loves good music,love songs,soaring vocals and unforgettable melodies will enjoy this album thoroughly."
4,"Very well done, worth the money.",This was a very well done CD with the best of Air Supply. Just be sure you prefer the live version compared to the studio. I prefer the studio tapings.
3,"Uhhh, Could've been better","It was alright. The mixing is a little off.The sound quality isn't what it could've been,. I wish they would've miked the audience better. I missed songs like ""Here I Am"" and ""Even the Nights Are Better"". It just seems kind of ""low budget"". But Russell Hitchcock is still my hero. He can do no wrong.Keep stirring the heart guys. God Bless Y'all"
1,Highly critical review,"This is a terrible CD. I like their music, but this particular CD is absolutely awful...Fro some reason, these guys are out of tune, their voices are shot (another review describes them as being ""mature""), they cannot hit the hight notes, and sound like they both have a bad cold or the flu when they recorded this. I think this was a final effort to squeeze money out of a credulous public that did not expect these ""artists"" or their music to simply be so bad in person. I am embarrassed to own this album, and I advise you to save your money and spend it on something else."
1,Ick!,"Icky, gooey, sticky, sweet junk. I never thought anybody could make the Carpenters sound cutting edge!"
1,Music to induce narcolepsy,Why buy this CD when you can go to K-Mart and hear the songs over the intercom speakers for free?
1,Wished I Could Have Liked It,"I'm sorry to say I didn't want to finish this one and I'm a huge JB fan! It started out okay, but boy, the characters faded into nothing! It wasn't at all interesting after the first few chapters. Con was a fine man but he didn't shine here as he should have. His character fizzled. Susan wasn't THAT bad, but she always had to stop and think if she should lie or tell the truth. Never did she just say what was on her mind in a truthful manner.Nicholas from AN ARRANGED MARRIAGE is still the best rogue."
3,I would give this 3 1/2 stars,I have just discovered Jo Beverley and started with the Arranged Marriage and have read them all so far in order (except Miles Story). And I have read them all in a week - so the stories are all fresh in my mind. I found this book book really boring. I agree with some of the other reviewers this just lacked something. But I do love her writing and am psyched to get started on the next book.
1,Ugh...,Sheesh?!?!...I couldn't do it you guys. I didn't even get through the first half...(You know it's bad when you paid for something and then put it in the donate pile without even reading it!)
4,Very formal look,"The watch is beautiful. Nice solid design. The watch color is coal black. The look and feel is very sober, it's a dress watch. The watch size is small considering the latest trend of watches than men wear. It is obviously very light because of titanium band and bezel. It comes with a 5 years warranty from citizen. Overall a nice watch but consider it's size and band color (grey) before buying."
3,Good but misleading nutritional info,"I thought this was good, but I have to agree with the people who said that the sodium content could be lowered. The label is misleading, as it tells you to put a cap full of seasoning on your popcorn. The nutritional info is for a 1/4 teaspoon of seasoning, which has a rather high amount of sodium. A cap full is at least 2 tablespoons of seasoning."
3,Tastey,"My first taste of popcorn seasoning was at the movies I like the taste of it .I decided to buy my own. I brought my first bottle of kernel at the supermarket.So I than decided to order some so I could share it with my family.We all said it did not taste like the popcorn seasoning in the movies, the seasoning in the movie taste better.The kernel season's has a powder taste and the movie season's has a nice garlic grain taste.I will use the rest of the kernel season's but I don't think I will buy any more.Sistradee"
5,The Best Popcorn Seasoning Ever!,"First tried this product in a local Harkins Theatre and just had to have some for home. The seasoning is available in a dizzying variety of flavors, but the garlic parm is just the ticket!"
5,Make your corn pop!,"I discovered Kernel Seasons at Wal-Mart of all places...and like most decent items find at that mass retailer, they no longer carry it. This is an awesome way to make low-fat microwave popcorn taste decadent without adding calories...highly recommend this as well as White Cheddar and Ranch. Yum!"
5,Great for smooth-top stoves!,"I have been searching for a grill pan that I can use on my smooth-top stove for quite some time and was elated when I finally found this one. Most grill pans do not have a flat, smooth bottom and can't be used on smooth-top stoves. This one has a large round, flat disk on the bottom that ensures full contact with smooth-top burners and even heat distribution. It's a heavy-duty, quality pan."
4,A great place to start,"I just started blowing on a harp I picked up and wanted something to learn some simple blues by. Although the premise of the book is a story of some cave men who learned the harmonica, there is a great deal of information here. I even found it a bit inspirational. I would recommend to those of you with a sense of humor who want to start learning for fun. If you are looking for strictly technical don't buy it."
2,5 pages of information hidden in an entire book,Jon Gindick trys to teach playing the blues in way that is entertaining and non-intimidating. But in the end the message is lost in a sea of meaningless chatter and storytelling. There are some good pieces of information in the book but they are difficult to root out.
3,too many people writting this book,"If you can get past the inconsistancies in the book(such as the dark Elf's Grandfather suddenly being refered to as his Father)or the writting which at one point is very shallow as if the author is rushing to finish, then at another point more detailed like most of Misty's writting, the story line is very delightful. It almost seems as if there were several writters on this book and none of them bothered to read each others work."
4,handles too short for good leverage,"These pliers would be fine for copper wire or very fine jewelry wire. But for 18 gauge galvanized wire, the handles are so short that cutting requires a lot of effort."
2,"Weak Cutters, Would Not Buy Again","The build quality of these cutters is nice and the grip is comfortable. The cutters however are very very weak compared to lots of other cutters I have tried. I have been using them to cut 1 or 2 pieces of 0.38"" safety wire and it takes entirely too much effort. They are good to cut off zip-ties but that's about it. Spend a couple more bucks and get some big boy cutters."
1,not made in Japan!is Taiwan..maby they sand me wrong knife?,is NOT made in Japan! is Taiwan..maby they sand me wrong knife?and knife Blade Engraving Asymmetric''Not the same color different from the photo holder'i areldy send back too seller
1,Run Don't walk,This is the worst product I have ever purchased. I bought the printer for light use and in less than 100 pages printing it died. Konica told me to buy random parts from them that didn't work. Then they told me to take it to one of their technicians. Wasted more money than the printer was worth. There's a reason no one has a Konica printer. They are horrible. Don't waste your money like I did. Horrible.
3,A book on color printed in black & white???,"I'm not sure about all editions of this book but the one that I own (paperback...) has NO color inside at all! Who ever heard of a book on the subject of color that didn't include any? What were they thinking? I'm sure it's a fascinating read but if someone is interested enough in color to read this hefty tome, you've got to think they might also enjoy looking at it too. This is an oversized thick book which is at least 95% text. There are very few black & white diagrams either."
3,Chevreul today,"Is not easy to review a book that is published since XIXth century, too much water have flown in the color theory field, knowing that, I bought it as a reference book, I recommend it only under this consideration"
5,Beautiful work by Ms. Roberts,"Beautiful work by Ms. Roberts. A treasure for all women to read and enjoy. The essays are poignant and well documented. This is a book that should live on through history and handed from one woman to another.recommending also: Founding Mothers,Secret Life Of Bees,Three Junes,Lonely Hunter,Nightmares Echo"
5,Must Read!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Quite stupendous!!!!!!!!!,"This book is what life is all about for the vast majority of women. It tells it like it is and how good it can be to be a woman, wife, mother, daughter, professional woman. It looks realistically at women and how our personalities change depending on what role we are in at any given time. Cokie puts herself on the line right at the very beginning, leaving herself in quite a vulnerable position talking about how her sister died and how she and the rest of her family dealt with it. She left me in awe and wonder at how she does it, yet I know the answer--we all do it because either we love it (our families and our careers) or it must be done. Cokie, you left me feeling proud to be a woman. Bravo!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,The Other Side of Cokie,"As a long-time fan of Cokie Roberts, I was excited to read more about her interesting family history. I found myself wishing the book was penned as more of a memior and that Cokie would have peppered the text with some political commentary rather than exploring the relationships between women. I was bored and annoyed at times reading about the almost sacred bonds that she shares with so many women. I was similary annoyed at the entire book ""Ya-Ya Sisterhood"" and was unable to relate to the relationships Cokie described. I had a love/hate relationship with this book, but am still a fan of Roberts. And I'm still holding out for the memior."
2,Insubstantial,"I found this book to be superficial.Given the title, I was expecting some truly thoughtful observations which might help me understand others, and perhaps also experience some personal truths about my own mother-child relationships in a new way. Given the author's talent and intellect, I expected a provocative book. But the book, while pleasant enough, was mostly just a memoir and did not live up to its title. While I respect the author, I'm not sure I would have spent money for her biographical efforts.I suspect this was quite meaningful for her --- but I was disappointed.Mary Romeyn, author, Nutrition and HIV: A New Model for Treatment"
1,I thought the book was a little shallow and arrogant.,"I wanted to know more about Cokie Roberts. She is well connected and has a wonderful family. I never felt she let us into her life. So, the book is as satisfying as the morning paper. The depth of all her stories are like a 2 page newpaper column that leave you wanting to read the book. Where's the beef?"
3,Surprisingly lightweight,"I bought this book because it was written by Cokie Roberts, whose TV and radio political commentary I admire and enjoy. But I was surprised at this book's light weight. I enjoyed reading about her family and herself, but ended up knowing very little in depth about any of them (including her mother's name), although her stories about her aunts are hilarious. They reminded me of the Ya Ya Sisterhood. I found the other women Roberts wrote about a little dull. I'm sure they are not dull, but Roberts' writing is. Come on, Cokie, you can do better than this. Readers should get in-depth thinking in books, not sound bites or a two-minute feature TV story. Happily, the book is an easy reader and can be zoomed through in no time, allowing women to get on with their busy lives. No new insights here."
4,A must read for every daughter!,"I thought I came of age at the start of the women's lib movement but after reading Cokie's book I had to step back and thank my lucky stars that the movement was fomenting long before it became a cause celebre. If it were not for the pioneers of my Mom and Grandmother's generations, women today would not have the opportunities they have. Of course, we always lament that the pace to working equality is slow, but when you realize how far you have come you can have great hope for the future. I have always known that women were special in every way, and that sometimes gets lost today where everyone is judged by what ""they do"". Way to go, Cokie!"
4,A great gift for the beginning gardner!,"I purchased this on a whim, looking for a birthday gift for a friend. She recently bought a house that has a small area for her to garden and I thought that this would be a perfect starter set.Having bought Strathwood items from Amazon before I knew to expect a reasonably good quality set. I took a thorough look at all of the items when I received them, even opening and sitting on the chair. I was very pleased with everything, but I think it would be nice if it came in a more presentable box. The mailing box is the only box you receive. Once it is open, the items are bagged up. I choose to use my own box to repackage and wrap it.My friend was very happy with the gift as she didn't have anything purchased yet and said she was looking forward to getting outside once the weather is more reasonable."
4,Nice item for the gardener,"This is an excellent value. Tools are very good quality and worth nearly the price of the whole set (currently 22). But a couple minor problems that might be major problems for you:1) The interior of the bag is dark. I don't know about you, but just like purses, I have difficulty finding things in pouches and bags when the lining is dark.2) The stool may hold 230 pounds, but I am not sure if it would be comfortable. I'm a 140# woman. The seat's OK but can be a bit uncomfortable on my backside if I don't sit in it just right. If I was 20 pounds heavier, I doubt that I would use it at all.In retrospective, I think I might have been better off with one of the rolling seats with storage made out of plastic. It would be easier to clean, more mobile, & more comfortable on the backside. Nevertheless, it still was a good purchase."
3,to kill a mockingbird cliff notes,"The condition of the book was OK and was as promised. The delivery time was longer than I had expected, even though is was within the alloted time. The vendor did not respond to my email inquiring about the delivery date."
2,Read the Real Book,"Only read Cliff's Notes if your desperate, because the book is absolutly fabulous. You're robbing yourself of a great book if you decide to skip the book and read the Cliff's Notes."
3,10th grade son,"My son had a very hard time getting into the actual book. The vocabulary was so different he spent a lot of time on one page. I purchased the cliff notes for him to read. Once he understood what everything meant and the story itself, he really actually enjoyed reading the book. I would never substitute Cliff Notes for the actual book, but in this case it made a huge difference. Finished his report on time and I have no doubt he will do well on the test (using the Cliff notes as a study guide). My reluctance to use Cliff notes is slowly changing -- using them more of a study guide in conjunction with the book. He will always be required to read the actual book."
5,great!,This book made my life in English class so much easier! I bought a new version of the book and the detailed summaries and character analysis helped me very much. The booklet is concise but full of information. Thank God for Cliffsnotes!
4,"Cliff""s Notes ""To Kill A Mockingbird.""",Great help if you are in the stage production. I've used Cliff.s Notes many times to research a play I'm directing and I've been doing it 50 years (70 productions.) Great Service.
3,Nothing to get excited about,I had to read this book for a grad class. There's nothing exciting about it. He could have make this more enjoyable to read.
2,totally unacceptable,"I have purchased Hammond World Atlas, and it does not seemed to be prepared by renowned professional atlas publisher, I was disappointed when receiving it and would not recommend anybody to buy it if they intend to based on positive past experience with Hammond products, I found the following facts omitted and does not reflect the bright name Hammond holds:1- Macau still Portogese even in 1999 or 2000 !!!2- Central Asia was illustrated with Russia and in Europe section !!!3- flag colors are extremely poor!! carmen replaced all the tones of red!!!4- no flag for Hong Kong SAR!!!5- Walvis Bay in Nanmibia still under the administration of South Africa!!!Can anyone imagine buying a book that teaches wrong things!!!, I wish that Amazon or Hammond can accept the above and bear shipping it back charges with full refund of order's total."
3,Linguistic Evidence,This book was purchased for a class I am currently taking. The book is ok it is very complex in many sections.
5,You'll never feel sorry for yourself again,"This was an inspiring true life tale of how one man rose above his dire circumstances. You can almost feel the coldness of the ore mines in the middle of a Russian winter, where the author was forced into slave labor. This book reminds me of Night (by Elie Wiesel). Read it--you won't be sorry!"
5,Donbas,I had to read this book in my English class back in 1973. I thought it was quite a story. The author even came to our class and spoke to us about the experience. You can imagine the impact that had on me. I am thrilled to have found the book here and am so looking foward to reading it again as an adult and for my children to read it also.
4,good cookie,Great tasting sugar free cookie..crispy and no after taste.....but the shipping is outragoues for the size and weight of the product.
5,Great place for all your figures!,"After having all the Justice League ""guys"" all over the house, I decided to hunt up a place for them all to live and finally found this case. It's really nice too. Nothing at all like my old Barbie doll cases. This case has places to actually slide the figures into the slots and they actually stay in place without flopping around whenever carried. It's really nice how they stay so very neat and don't get scratched up at all. If you can find one, I bought mine on an online auction site, be sure to grab it. It's well worth the money! Highly recommend!"
1,"3rd Edition, Same old stuff","Reimer wants his readers to think he's done something important by putting his tired, old ideas into new words (here and there) and using a new cover. Only his rabid followers will agree. This is the same old stuff that Reimer has always tried to sell and it fails for the same basic reasons: Reimer does not have -- Reimer never had -- a plausible explanation of the nature and value of music. Reimer is obvioulsy desperate -- he's running very hard -- to save his legacy in this ""third"" book (the same book x 3!). But he cannot. He fails, again, because a new generation of music education philosophers -- Bowman, Jorgensen, Elliott, Regelski -- has already exposed Reimer's poor thinking, weak scholarship, and faulty logic in the past. This ""third"" edition is full of the same old problems."
1,1 star is a gift.,"I concur with many of the 1 star reviewers. I do not care for this book or Mr. Reimer's writing style. While there are some decent points, the book is not an easy or interesting read."
2,"Words, words, and more words...","The man has interesting viewpoints, but these are all overshadowed by the overwhelming verbage. He can explain these principles in fewer paragraphs without missing out on anything. Instead, he opts to confuse readers by using too many words and by beating around the bush. I'd rather read something else if this weren't a required text."
3,OK but...,Somewhat larger and heavier than anticipated. Date dial extremely small and very difficult to read. Would be perfect if size reduced by 25% and date dial doubled in size.
5,Great watch,"Looks fantastic, keeps time perfectly, but you really do have to keep wearing it, 36 hours is perhaps optimistic. Nothing else to add, it's the nicest watch i've owned."
4,A fun and dressy watch to own,"Fossil came out with an enjoyable self winding watch. At least for now it is fun to watch the rotor piece turn as the watch winds itself to your natural wrist movements. While the watch feels heavy as you put in on for the first time, you will forget you are wearing it after a brief time.The clasp is easy to open and close. The face is large and easy to read. There are only two drawbacks. First, there is no illumination, so if you need to know the time when it is dark, this is not a watch you should buy.Second, the date is small. This seems to be true on all the new self winding fossil models, but the numbers on this watch are larger than other models.It comes with an 11 year warranty, which is a great value for a watch in this price range. The literature says the watch can go 40 hours without movement, but I suspect it will be along time before this watch sits idle long enough to verify this claim."
2,Not Thrilled.......,"I bought this for my husband for christmas and I had high hopes for it. It is a very smart looking watch and goes with both his business dress and casual weekend clothes. The only problem with the watch, (which is a big one!) is the fact that it keeps losing time. It is always speeding up or slowing down and he has to adjust the time quite frequently."
5,Fantastic!!! Fabulous!!! Outrageously Beautiful!!!,"I discovered Kent very recently but have managed to acquire all of their albums in a short time. This is by far the best album Kent has released - and I love them all, whether they are being sung in Swedish or English (as in the case of Isola and Hagnesta Hill)! The sound is mellow, Jocke's voice is penetratingly beautiful and the lyrics, for us who know Swedish, are so poetic it almost hurts. I will most definately buy this album when it is released in English."
3,Questionable,"I seem to be the only person who doesn't enjoy this CD very much. The first song is solid, but after that I lose interest. The alblum art is very cool :) ."
4,Worth checking out,"This new album was a bit overproduced sounding for me. I preferred ""Isola"" (my fave)with it's stripped down, almost haunting melodies and melancholy emotion. This album is more upbeat and the vocals are again beautiful, warm and nostalgic. I'm looking forward to the English version to come out so I know what they are saying, however, Swedish is a pleasant sounding language (not severe, prominent like German or Russian)The foriegn language factor is not annoying at all here.A couple tracks are on the cheesy side, yet there are about 3-4 tracks that make the album worth buying. (It's almost impossible to find an album nowadays where you absolutely dig every one of the songs)Kent is becoming one of my favorite bands of the moment."
4,I enjoyed this series...,"I was interested in these books after watching a BBC miniseries on the novel on my Netflix account. It was a very good story and I was interested in knowing what happens to Tilly after the first book so I began looking for the trilogy. I greatly enjoy all of Cookson's novels. I think they are well written with powerful female protagonists. They have the drama and romance. These are like grittier versions of Jane Austen. I love Jane Austen too, but sometimes her world is so pristine and the in Cookson's novels the work is depicted as exactly what it was, sometimes life is harsh and you have to go out and make a path for yourself and sometimes love is not easy. Hope you enjoy these books as much as I have..."
4,Tilly Trotter,"With 1100 pages in the Omnibus version of Tilly Trotter it seems daunting at first, but after already viewing the movie on the Romance Channel I was ready for the whole, unabridged story. It does a great job of telling Tilly's life but is short on romance and long on hardship."
2,Started off well but then a big disapointment,"I thought I had bought myself a really good book . Then the ending spoiled it. This book is excellent right up until the very end, which is a shame because I really loved it. Buy it if you want, but don't be too disapointed"
4,Great Support for Cake Decorators,"Purchased to support multi-tiered cakes. A much easier and quicker option than the regular plastic pillars that are available. Maybe a few more of the straws need to be used, but given the ease of use, these receive my vote."
3,"Good seller, not so good product",The item arrived in a timely manner and was as described. Unfortunately I tend to cook my tapioca pearls a little longer so they are easy to chew. This makes some of them too big for even these straws. I might just stick with a long teaspoon.
2,Bland little cookies,These cookies are not as good as the almond ones. I would expect chocolate to be more flavorful.
4,Put down the rock and take My hand!,"I have been a Christian over thirty years; but in recent months, I have really struggled with my Christianity. Occasionally, I catch myself stacking rocks as the third brother in ""The Parable of the River;"" and I need a reminder of God's unfathomable love. In the Grip of Grace is that type of reminder. Emotionally gripping, Lucado's easy-flowing style guides the reader through the best and thankfully, most entertaining commentary on the book of Romans I have ever read. The introduction to the endearing Billie Jack was worth the price of the book! In the Grip of Grace is the literary equivalent of hot tea on a cold day; and I would definitely recommend it to both Christians and non-Christians."
5,Why it is so hard for people to believe they are saved,"Using the book of Romans, Lucado illustrates that in spite of our sinful nature, God has always loved us and always will. It is our unwillingness to believe the free gift of salvation and grace that is truly incredible.No matter how badly we beat ourselves up or however unforgiving we are of ourselves, God will recieve us with loving, open arms.A must read for the saved and un-saved"
2,Grace is great -- Max is mediocre.,"Unfortunately, Mr. Lucado's writing style doesn't lend itself to the lucid treatment of grace. I found his analogies weak and his allegories uninteresting. More to the point, the issue of grace is pivotal to a growing relationship in Christ. I would hate to cause dismay in a new believer who thought Mr. Lucado's take on the subject was the bottom line. May I suggest the Ragamuffin Gospel by Brennan Manning. Now there's a 10!"
5,Learn About Amazing Grace,"Two years ago I began a study of the grace of God, and this volume greatly encouraged me.This analogies are great; his use of Scripture is carefully handled. I highly recommend this volume if somone is attempting to discover what is grace."
5,Good book,I like a more of a teaching book than one that is filled with stories. This one is filled with stories along with the teaching for illustration. He does an excellent job. It is just me personally...not my cup of tea. But there are many people who love this kind of book and I am sure it would be a real blessing. :-) He did an excellent job.
4,Fault finding bridge builder,"My review is not meant to be a beautiful write up for Max, I am sure he is a great guy, but hey, even his insurance company has problems with him. (I must be a the judgemental type) This book helped me realize that no matter how hard I try or how hard I think I am trying its not good enough. I cant jump to the moon, I cant make it up the river alone, and I cant place a value of a sin and try to ""repay it with good"". I am helpless. The book made me feel uncompfortable and small, but compared to God I think thats exactly how we have to feel to even accept his grace let alone understand it.I reccomend this book to anyone who is desperate enough to listen. Dont read this for entertainment, Max is funny, but not that funny. Read it if you want to change. I know I did.Thanks Max, for allowing God to use you as His megaphone."
3,"Feel good stuff, but not a lot of substance","Lucado has a way of communicating in such a way that you feel the love of God, and the forgiveness God offers. If you need to spend some time trying to get in touch with God's mercy and love, and you want a simple read, then this is the book for you. However, if you're looking for something that has a little more substance, then I would suggest a couple of titles by Jerry Bridges - Transforming Grace or the Discipline of Grace. Both of these cover the same topics that Lucado covers but with a more thorough exposition of the biblical text, and a more lasting and thorough coverage of what can be a somewhat controversial, or easily misunderstood subject. Don't get me wrong, Lucado is a great storyteller - he has a talent for communicating the emotion of God - but his books don't do much more than that."
5,Enlightening,This book is absolutely amazing. Mr. Lucado offers insight into the grace of God that I never once considered. It's awesome and thought provoking.
2,Where's the saffron?,"The author writes about saffron the way I cook with saffron - sparingly. The book was probably 70% autobiography and 30% saffron. There were times where I would finish a chapter thinking, ""Where was the saffron in that?""I'll probably only ever read one book about saffron, and it was a mistake to have it be this one."
4,Monster exhaust,"I just received my order of my monster exhaust,took four days from ordering, Thank you. it took less than two hours for the install and it sounds great. i was hoping it was full stainless but turns out it wasn't. I am happy with it anyway. Thank you for the fast service and great product, I would recomend this to my friends, thanks again. Tony Clearfield UT."
4,Unique character,"Carlene Carter first appeared in the end of the 70's,and most of her best songs can be heard here.Most are of the joys and failures of relationships.She has traveled a long way to find the same rainbow we all long for,and she plays it,crystal clear.All are very tuneful and catchy with pretty clever lyrics to these stories.After 5 marriages though,one has to wonder what she wants,really,short of Mr. Perfect-it's hard to believe all the bad luck was totally hers.I do wish her well now that drugs are a thing of the past.Maybe the future will be more enjoyable."
4,underrated gems,"Totally luv Carlene, and enjoying re-visiting all these great tunes. Forget that she wrote so many gems. One thing, which is no fault of the vendor at all....be sure and know this product is a cassette, as I was so excited to find the collection I ordered impulsively (the 4 beers while surfing online may have contributed to the impulse shopping). Product arrived quickly and as advertised."
3,Wasted opportunity,"I love CC and I think her I Fell in Love album is one of the greatest albums of all time. But this is a complete wasted opportunity -- what is here from I Fell in Love, Little Love Letters and Little Acts of Treason is an ok selection (but could have been much better) but the selections from her first 4 albums are horrific!! Never Together is her WORST song of all time. Who picked this stuff? And definitely needs to be in chronological order -- her early stuff sounds really weak next to her later, much better stuff. Recommend Platinium Collection (import) instead."
3,good but not great,"This album was good, not great. If you want to hear great then get Tony Rice the bluegrass album or another one called ""ultimate Pickin'"" , for bluegrass with singing try ricky skaggs at charleston hall. Those are great albums, this was okay."
2,Bluegrass Breakdown: 14 Instrumentals,I liked only the tracks 1 and 6. The songs have good banjo picking but are not beautiful enough to keep me listening more than one time.
1,Bluegrass Breakdown: 14 Instrumentals,"This product was delivered on Monday, April 16th to the wrong address. The postal service is very uncooperative.They supposedly have put a trace on it.So as of today I have still not received my CD which was for a wedding in April. I finally figured out how to email Amazon last week and I still haven't heard anything from them either. I do a lot of shopping on line, but this has been a real bad experience, especially with the P.O.Vicky"
2,"Has a bit more ambition than most, but it's still not good","This really isn't that good, but I do admire the attempt to distinguish this book from others of its genre. Here the hero is conflicted by years of abuse from his father and has basically fallen apart after the death of his only real friend, and the demon who has returned is using the ""healing of the sick"" scam to gain power . Too bad the quality of the writing doesn't match the creative plot. Clumsy dialogue and less than memorable descriptions keep the reader from becoming enmeshed in the story, and after a short while the hero becomes a whiner instead of someone you'll actually care about. I don't expect much from this type of book, but it should at least be enjoyable. This didn't meet that criterion."
4,Does a fair job of keeping the Diablo series fresh.,"With an all new cast of characters and villains, The Black Road is another trip into the world of Diablo. The beginning of the book starts of pretty slow, but then picks up gradually, filled with suspense and action. The reason I didn't give this book a perfect score was because some scenes seem rushed, others tend to not much very much sense, and the time passing in the book is often confusing. The ending:sort of a let down/cliffhanger, leaves me wishing for more. But all in all, a good few days of reading in store."
3,Not at as good as the first one of the series,"I love books that start with some injection of rush. This book lacks one. Although it is related to the game, it offers very little conection with the original (game) story, maybe 2 pages at most. The plot is slow and (rarely) a little contradictory. From my point of view, the end is not as good. The three stars because of the game series and because the story usually follows unexpected paths.Not a book for non-Diablo fans."
5,One of the greatest books I've read.,"Diablo # 2 the black road is simply put one of the best books I've ever read. I'm a huge fan of the Diablo games and it got me to try out the books. I read Legacy of Blood and was hooked from the first page. Then I found out the Black Road was coming out and I bought it as soon as I could. I immediately dove into this book and loved it. It starts out with action and stays action packed the whole way through. I read mostly adventure and sci-fi so this book was right up my alley. I would reccomend this book to anyone who loves a great adventure or is a fan of Diablo. Not many books keep me gripped and turning pages like this one, but I was up late at night not wanting to go to bed because I was busy reading."
3,pretty good,"im really over 13 but im just using this,ok first of all the three diablo books in the series hace NOTHING to do with each other, second of all ive read 1 and 2 i liked 1 much better and 2 was ok.it was good cause it had a lot of action but it wasnt the best books in the world.I love diablo and play it everyday and so i know a lot about it, this book didnt have a lot to do with diablo a couple names but thats all, plus in diablo you never fight pirates or anything like that so it was good but not my favorite i suggest the first one in this series."
5,Excellent and spell-binding movie.,This video is an excellent addition to anyone's library. It follows the journeys of four runaway slaves to the promised land in Canada. The filming is beautiful and the story heartrending and powerful. Shows the difference that human beings can make by helping one another against the odds. I would definitely recommend this movie.
4,Good pick for history classes,"I used this movie in my U.S. History class as we were discussing Slavery, the Underground Railroad and the events leading up to the Civil War. It gives a great depiction of what slaves would go through to get away from the everyday struggle of being a slave. Very interesting and engaging for students to easily follow along."
5,Strat pickguard,"Not much to add,really, it is what it is. Amazon had the best deal by far on a genuine Fender tortoise shell pickguard. The guard is perfect, and the holes matched up well on a cream-colored Vintage Modified Squier strat. Since the cost is about the same, I recommend a genuine Fender guard over any of the aftermarket versions. Fender's tortoise pattern looks better than the others,IMO,and they always come with the grounding foil tape on the back.You can't go wrong here."
4,Good For The Price,"For the price the watch is very good:Pros- eye pleasing- gold tone looks very elegant- eco drive makes battery replacement a non-issueCons- I would have to say is its low or non-existent water resistanceUnless you plan to go to the beach or pool with the watch on this is a great dress watch for any woman who wants to match with her earrings, necklaces, and bracelets."
5,Womens Citizen watch,It was exactly what was ordered. It arrived in a timely fashion. The watch was a gift and she was very pleased. Good Job!
4,Great phone,"I got this phone when it first became available, mid-contract (so it cost the full $250 it was priced for when it first came out) and it was the hot thing to get at Nokia (for awhile) due to its incredibly small size. It's a really good phone--too bad the cell phone company I got it from, Edge Wireless, isn't! It's as said before amazingly small and compact, colorful and elegant but still cool. It's compact design is, of course, the major selling factor, but it's reception is awesome, polyphonic tones, text messaging and other uses make it a worthwhile phone as well. Highly recommended from someone who doesn't know much about cell phones--it's hot, but so easy to use."
2,Poor customer service of Dealswarehouse,"I placed an order in Aug, but I didnt receive the phone until now, we've contacted Dealswarehouse several times, but they didnt provide us any solution... Amd after I saw the reviews from others, we are not the only one who didnt receive the item, think carefully before you buy from them. Thank you Amazon provided us assistance."
2,nokia 3120 unlocked,"Tho phone came from Indonesia and the headings are not named the same as Nmerican names. The phone will not update raoming codes, so it is often without service. We have been unable to resolve the issue through our service provider."
3,"cute, works okay","I have to preface by saying this is the first phone I've owned. That said, the layout is pretty straightforward, and there are lots of little functions tucked away to make life easier; dated reminders with alarms, countdown timer, email, etc.On the negative side, the display is impossible to read in strong light. Time displays in a nice big font but only when the screen is dark -- good luck seeing it under most lighting conditions. And a case is mandatory -- too easy to lean against the buttons when it is in a pocket."
1,where is it???,"I wish I could write something about this phone but I have been waiting close to 3 months for this thing, where is it."
5,SO HILARIOUS!,This book is so laugh out loud funny! I read it on a trip and people kept looking at me because I couldn't stop laughing. The whole series is awesome read them all!
2,Battery Pack,The controller worked great. But the battery pack didn't last even a week!!!! I had to go out and buy a new one! And the worst thing was that this was a gift for someone else!!!
5,Great Gift,"I bought this item for a gift, It was delivered to me fast and it was exactly what it said in the description. Thank you for great service."
2,Bad,"When I got the controller and charger it looked ok, but the charger didn't work. The controller worked with the other chargers I have at my house so I know it wasn't the battery pack or the controller so it had to be the charger... very disappointing."
2,In concurrance above...,"At this point in time, the accessories separately are 63. If you spring for this bundle, it's $70. Buy them separately please?!?!?!?!?!!"
3,Xbox play and charge,Doesn't want to work with my older head set. Other than that the kit works fine.
4,Great controller combo. Should have been priced less,"Got it on a Amazon one day only sale. White controllers smooth plastic finish makes your hands sweat a lot. Black is similar to original xbox controller finish. It is feels much better as your hands wont sweat on long play sessions. Keep a open eye, grab it when it is on sale.Normally combos are cheaper than individual items. It is hard to understand why MS is charging more for the combo kit. This should be priced at 50$ or less."
5,great thing to have,"we bought this to go with our xbox system, this has been very useful and has no problems at all."
4,Nice overall,"This controller is fine for gaming. However, the d-pad is way too sensitive. It chooses items then moves to the next item when you let go. The plug in part is great and the rechargable battery is even better. I like that instead of swapping batteries in a middle of a game when the battery runs out that I could just plug it in and continue on. I think this was a good purchase."
5,Great Controller!,What can I say its a basic XBOX 360 controller with a battery pack. I did have a little trouble at first getting the controller to turn on. I initially had to hold down the button for like 30 seconds but after that one time its been working like normal.
4,Xbox 360 Play & Charge Kit with Black Controller Review,"Xbox 360 Play & Charge Kit with Black ControllerIt's great to be able to play while connected to the charge cable and shows no interruption to the connection when I play my games. However, it seems that the energy consumption of the rechargeable battery is rapid and usually after around 15-20 hours of use the battery needs to be recharged again. The design of the charge cord is somewhat faulty because the connection to the top of the controller is very tight and the way to remove it is to yank the cord from the controller. It makes me somewhat frightened that I would damage the controller itself because of all the force needed to remove it. Overall, I enjoy the color and it helps me distinguish my ""personal"" Halo controller from my other white ones and there is no noticeable difference in quality between the black and white wireless controllers."
4,My controller,"My controller didnt charge when connected with the cord available and the pins were partially bent when i took a closer look. Will have to buy another charger (probably the docking one). The controller was scratched but other than that, i got what i wanted, which was another controller and it works."
1,"wass not new, and not a black controller. joystick loose and couldent sprint on call of duty games","wass not new, and not a black controller. joystick loose and couldent sprint on call of duty games was not a BLACK CONTTROLLER"
5,Beyond Yummy!!,These cookies are WONDERFUL. They have a great crunch and wonderful peacan taste. I am happy that my low sugar lifestyle does not have to suffer any longer. Because of these cookies I can have cookies again!
4,I like these!,"I'm not much of a cookie eater, but this snack was recommended in the book BELLY FAT CURE by Jorge Cruise as part of a healthy eating plan. I purchased several flavors. Although at first I felt they tasted a bit ""low-sugar-y,"" I soon got to like them a lot. Possibly this happened because the eating plan in the book restricts sugary foods, and I soon became accustomed to less sugar.My husband is a diabetic and he loves these too. They certainly can fit into a low-sugar diet as a satisfying snack. I would recommend you give these a try."
2,Way too small,I was very disapointed to see how cheap this looks. It doesn't fit my husbands truck seat as it should have.
5,Beefy Delicious!,"I cannot stress enough how good this feels in your hand. The balance is spot on and the quality is what you expect from Ka Bar. Exceedingly sharp coming out of the box - beautiful lines on the knife - a true survival knife. Beefy blade/full tang. Purchase with confidence. As others reviewers have mention, you probably wouldn't want to pry with it all that much, but in a pinch I'm sure she'll do the trick. Notice: There's an extra inch of blade on this model which may seem like a bit much indoors. Rest assured that when in its element, the size is perfect - regardless of your mission."
4,Epic knife,"I will start by justifying my 4 star choice, the Knife itself is EASILY and w/o a doubt a 5 Star knife but the sheath it comes with is a TOTAL piece compared to other sheaths Ka-Bar has out... but other than that the knife came in a matter of days after the order was placed, and it is Sharper than anything i have ever owned, it shaved my arm cleaner than the razor i use to shave my face :O in all i HIGHLY recomend this knife, its not clunky, it is a lean mean killin machine and you shall not be dissapointed!"
4,"Great Knife, Sheath is Garbage","Very impressed by the quality of the knife itself. Razor sharp blade, beautiful design. My issues are with the sheath. Here we have a fantastic tactical knife with a below standard sheath. It is made from nylon and leather. The leather is very poor quality, in fact some of the black dye was worn off right out of the box. Very cheesy. Secondly it has two redundant straps that go over the grip. Why couldn't one of the straps go diagonal over the guard so one would be able to mount the knife inverted? To top it all off, Ka-bar does not make a kydex sheath to fit this knife. The blade is to wide. Seriously people throw me a fricken bone here. Rated four stars because the knife is awesome."
5,The BEST fighting knife Ka-Bar currently makes.,"This knife is a serious beast! The photos do not do it justice, and with all the other Ka-Bar knives on the market I feel this one gets lost in the shuffle.SIMPLY AMAZING. After a final touch-up on my Spyderco Sharpmaker, which is a must have if you own any Ka-Bar, this knife is ""Scary"" sharp.I would hate to be forced to use it to defend myself, but rest assured it WILL get the job done!"
5,Awsome knife,"caution, owning/holding this knife will make you FEEL LIKE (key words are FEEL LIKE) a ninja gutting, zombie slashing, dino killing, knife fighting, special forces god!!! But we all know dinosaurs are dead as the do-do, and knife fighting takes years to master and is bloody, messy and utterly painful (read: forget the movies). But if you wish to awaken you inner chuck norris then this be the knife. the sheath sucks but my gods what a knife...."
5,Ka-Bar black fighter,"All the quality you expect from a standard Ka-Bar but bigger! The rubberized handle is tacky, with a secure grip. The blade is quality steel and sharp, did I mention that it's bigger. If you are a fan of large knives you will love this blade, though not as massive or heavy as a Rambo knife it's and inch longer than standard, and wider, yet still quite useable. I give two thumbs up!"
4,Great knife Bad sheath,The knife is great very sharp hand is great the only thing i hated was the sheath the top botton to keep knife in place was to small and didnt work but overall good buy
2,Disappointing,"I have to say I am pretty disappointed in this slip cover, the fit is horrible (even though the packaging said it should fit my couch). I guess I also didn't realize at the time when I bought it how thin the material was, quite frankly (and to my dismay) it looks like a bed sheet (and feels like it) covering my couch. Live and learn."
5,Awesome!!!!,I received my Next Generation knife today. This knife is everything I was hoping it would be. It feels really good in my hand. It seems really durable and the blade is sharp right out of the box. I will be purchasing KaBar again in the very near future.
3,Feeding Spoon Defect,The set is nice but the feeding spoon came with a rough edge. I used Amazon Marketplace to notify the vendor. They contacted Oneida and said they will send a replacement set free of charge in a week. We shall see.
5,A gift that lasts for years,"The kids won't outgrow this set as fast as their clothes. A spoon for baby, spoon and fork for toddlers, plus all three utensils for preschool age. Dishwasher safe. Our family used three or four sets of these. Will save for ""someday"" when the grandkids visit. Easy gift idea for showers."
3,Can't seem to find the right settings or is the stereo just poor quality?,"I purchased the Panasonic SC-AK630 in December of 2005. So far, I have been quite unimpressed by the sound quality that so many other reviewers gave high marks. I'm not sure if I just haven't found the right settings or the stereo is just not as good as everyone made it out to be?"
3,"Great price, poor quality.","If you want a stereo that sounds clean and crisp, do not purchase this item. It has heavy, mushy, bass that is hard to compensate for. That being said, some (only some) audio sounds decent to the point that I can stop being bugged by the unbalanced sound. The preset remote equalizer helps some, but I just wish I could adjust it myself.The cd changer is loud and very slow and I cannot listen to a CD while it clunks around looking for CDs.I plugged my mp3 into the analog RCA inputs and found the sound extremely disappointing.For 450 watts, this unit does not crank, even with the bass and subwoofer turned up. At low volume, I have to have the bass down and the subwoofer off or the thumping overwhelms the music.I have not used the tape deck or tried to hook up to my video equipment for home theater.To sum up my overall experience, I would say this stereo is disappointing."
2,Overbearing Bass,"This system provides all the tools I was looking for...AUX in, MP3 play, AM/FM, etc. The only problem is that there is WAY too much bass output, even after unplugging the subwoofer and trying all the equalizer settings. The low frequency problem seems more enhanced when listening to the radio, something that I now avoid. One thing this unit does better than the old JVC unit it replaced is that it somehow manages to separate the stereo channels far more cleanly. The separation is easily noticeable not only on my familiar MP3 songs, but also with FM broadcasts. If you like wildly enhanced bass output this unit is for you. If you would love making Barbara Streisand sound a lot like Johhny Cash, this unit is for you. For me - I'll be returning the unit."
4,An excellent third volume,"This volume of Dual! gives an up-close and personal look at Miss Ra. All three episodes are pretty devoted to plot development and an exploration of the parallel world and the artifact. We learn a lot more about the Rara army and family. And, once again, there's a cliff-hanger ending. Overall, an excellent volume. Highly recommended."
4,"Rapturous rock, reggae and soul!","This often overlooked album in the Stones' catalogue shimmers with some good to great songs. It kicks off with the funky Hot Stuff, followed by the passionate Hand Of Fate which is vintage Stones.Cherry O Baby is a lovely slice of reggae with intriguing organ lines and brilliant vocalizing, while the road epic Memory Motel is a moving story song. Hey Negrita is a wailing bluesy number and Melody soulfully ambles along with lovely guitar, sax, piano and Mick's falsetto voice.Fool To Cry starts as a gentle ballad but gets pretty raucous eventually, while Crazy Mama is the Stones at their rocking best, a powerful conclusion to this great album.It may not be amongst the Rolling Stones' top ten albums, but Black And Blue contains some strong songs with great melodies and enthusiastic playing throughout with no dud tracks. Rediscovering it was a great pleasure."
4,Reba all year round!,"I'll admit it -- Anything Reba gets my vote. I guess I just have a thing for redheads, but I'm always eagerly awaiting the latest Reba CD or video, and I swoon for weeks whenever she comes to my city to perform. So a CALENDAR? I'm THERE! Month after month, Reba looks back at me from my wall. Need to know if I have an appointment? Reba will tell me. *snicker* The truth is, I get Reba calendars every chance I get. Some are better than others. I wish the photos in this one were slightly more focused (they were taken from her Singer's Diary tour, an EXCELLENT show), but each shot brings back that magical night when I was allowed along for Reba's trip down memory lane. From the Star Spangled Banner to her band's unfortunate end, it was all in the show, and it's all in this wonderful calendar! If you're a Reba fan, this calendar is a must-have!"
5,p-nut luvs nokia,I've owned a 6101 for 2 years and never had a problem even dropped it once or twice and still worked great the only reason i'll purchase another is because they will not withstand a 250lbs person acciendetally falling on it other than that i enjoyed the phone
2,Eh not the greatest,"I've had my 6101 for 2 months and it's not working already. It was dropped once and since then it quit working right. It would only work on speaker phone, and then all of a sudden the screen stopped working all together. You can't hardly hear the person you're talking to, I used to have to push the phone so hard against my ear to just barealy hear them. This phone is NOT worth the money, my advice, spend it on something else!"
2,Don't bother,"Definite durability issue, the antennae on mine is about ready to fall off. The menus are confusing (as are most Nokia's) unless you are familiar with them. I'll be looking to go back to an LG for the easy to use menus.."
3,Not Bad,"This wasn't a bad book, but it was a little too 'romantic' for my literary tastes .... just a little too much syrup."
5,Royal Crown Revue = Best in the Biz,"After listening to this album for almost a year, I still can't get enough of it. While most live albums can't compare to the recorded ones, this is not the case for Caught in the Act.I've always loved Sinatra's version of ""Something's Gotta Give"", and Royal Crown Revue knows how to do it justice. ""Who Dat?"" is a great tune (as they all are), and the solos in ""Hey, Pachuco!"" make you wish the song could go on forever.Buy this CD!"
5,The single best swing I have heard,"This album is the kind of album I'd use to intro anyone to swing. It has an amazing amount of energy, and starts hard and fast and never lets you down untill the last note of the last song.Highlights are 'Barflies at the Beach', 'Hey Pachuco'(with some incredible highlight work from several band members), and 'Poppity Pop Goes The Motorcycle'(The many false endings that just keep getting better and better). This is an album worth buying two of just so as to have a copy after your friends borrow it( and they will want to desperately)"
5,Swing with an Attitude!,"After hearing the Royal Crown Revue live as an opening act for the B-52's, I had to go buy an album. This album captures the intensity of their live shows. If you like swing, rock, or music in general, you must experience the non-stop energy of this album."
3,Not the original,This is not the original All I Ever Need Is You album which contained other excellent cuts not included on this cheap compilation. The entire album should be released on compact disc without these added live tracks.
3,ROCK AND ROLL AND SONNY AND CHER,"It has the deliciously campy album version of ""Mama Was A Rock and Roll Singer and Papa Used To Write All Her Songs"", and the tacky pseudo-psyche ""A Cowboy's Work Is Never Done"", the lovely ""All I Ever Need Is You"", the stupid ""When You Say Love"" ( once the musical jingle for a Coca Cola ad campaign ), and Sonny on vocals in ""You Better Sit Down Kids"", a hit record where divorce is put to melody. The live tracks are comedic nightclub versions of their biggest hit records, ( ""I Got You Babe"", ""The Beat Goes On"" ), and a dumbed-down version of ( as if it could get any dumber ) ""Bang, Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)"". I love the original if not classic hit records here but the live tracks are like a bad lounge act on a cheap cruise line. But if you like Sonny and Cher, then you like Sonny, and you'll like this."
2,Cher is better off without her Partner!,Beutiful songs that take you places are songs that say sonny SHUT UP AND LET CHER SING. The song Bang Bang and You'd better sit down kids are on this album Sonny Solos. Enough said right? Chers parts on the album are great but Sonny Spare Me. Just another breif note: Stay clear from Momma was a Rock'n'Roll Singer...!
5,Another great artist not given a fair chance!!!!!!!,"This is growing very tiresome. Country radio has deep-sixed several stars by not playing their songs on the radio. This is one of them. The strong ballad ""Fall Reaching"" did not get nearly as much radio airplay as it should have. ""When You Get To Be You"" is another good song that got ignored by radio. I am sick to death of potential stars creating unique music and getting completely ignored by radio. This music act was easily the best one to not make it in 1997! Radio jockies need to get their heads out of their butts and play more of the great unique material from people like Chris Ward!"
5,Great Product,"Along with good sound and many features that all work great, this one telephone takes the place of three things I had to tolerate on my small desk; telephone, caller ID machine and an answering machine. I love it!"
1,I literally bashed it with my fist,"This telephone is terrible. The buttons - usually the '2'- would often stick, even though they're just electronic contacts, resulting in a contant squeal of the tone while it dialed one digit 10 times. The message retrieval would also often become hung - one could not listen to or delete the messages. After two years of putting up with it, the last time it did this to me I just put my fist through it and threw it away.AT&T; should be embarassed to have their name on this telephone."
3,pros and cons of this model,"pros: a non-pricy at&t; speaker phone+answering machine.cons: the announcement of each voice message starts with a ""Power Failure"" greeting."
2,display dial doesn't work right,"Well, this is a weird one. The display dial feature doesn't work right. On my phone, if you hit the display dial of the number on caller ID, I get someone totally different then the number shown. For example, I hit display dial for a florida number, and got someone here in Pennsylvania. Would not recommend this phone."
2,Did NOT like this phone,"The sound was fine but the red light (signaling that the answering machine was on) was too large and too bright; the neighbors could see that light. There was ONE ring choice, with 4 pitches, but the same annoying ring. I'd try to turn the ringer volume down and accidentally mute it altogether. And the LED was unreadable from a seated position. Really, just an awful phone. I tried AT&T models 1856 and 1855 and they were virtually identical in their pros (sound quality) and cons (features, annoying light, bad ringer, very bad LED)."
3,AT&T Speaker Phone,This is a great telephone but I would like for the caller ID to light up. It is a good price for the quality of the phone.
3,Good speakerphone,"I chose the 1855 because it was an inexpensive speakerphone and it lives up to my expectations in that regard. I was disappointed that it didn't have more one-touch keys for dialing and has only nine two-touch memory dialing entries. Otherwise, it was easy to setup and is easy to use."
4,Pretty darn good basic answering machine/telephone,"The machine seems reliable and efficient, with good sound quality and attractive, pleasant design. There are second-level annoyances, however: The ringer choices are all irritating sounds, the message light is too big, too red, and too much like an emergency vehicle toplight. I like the language choices on the day/time readout and the ease of programming. It replaces an earlier model of the same brand I had for over ten years which was equally reliable. Bravo AT&T."
1,Skip this product.,"We had high hopes for this phone because it had the wanted features. The caller ID, the answering machine & the auto dial did not work at all. The speaker phone, after a call of several minutes, would fade out & sometimes return. You can apologize to a friend, but this was not amusing when on a business call.We appreciate Amazon for taking care of the problem."
1,AT & T 1855,"When I received this item the first time, the call ID would not work. I returned it for a replacement. When the replacement came, I had the same problem. I returned it this time for a refund."
4,Desk phone,"Does the job well. Had I thought about it a little more, I would have purchased a phone with Caller ID exhibited."
3,answer phone,Bought this for a small professional office. The voice quality on playback from remote is poor. It is relatively okay but not nearly up to old AT&T standards. It is also difficult to get the machine to respond remotely to the touch tone signal code both on land line and cell phones. Disappointing.
3,phone better as a wall-mounted than desk phone.,"If you plan to mount this phone, then you'll not have a problem with the fact that the phone cord out-weighs the phone unit. The original cord is too short, so you'll want to get a longer one, but the phone is so light that as the cord slips to the ground, the phone goes with it. I've had no complaints from callers when using the speaker portion and have walked about 4-6ft from phone at times, which says a lot for the sensitivity of the mic. Besides the light-weight aspect, I'd also would like the caller ID illuminated - when it's night and I just have the computer monitor for lighting, the reading on the phone is difficult to see."
4,Only one problem,"Overall, this is a very good phone with many solid features. My only complaint is that there is no way to adjust the volume for the message alert. Because of the poor location of the phone jack in my kitchen, I have to put this phone in the master bedroom upstairs. Unlike my last AT&T; phone, which allowed me to adjust the volume of the message alert, this one has a very quiet beep, and the volume can't be adjusted.If you plan to put this phone in an out-of-the-way location, you may want to consider a different phone. Otherwise, you will have to visually check the phone to see if you have messages."
4,Pretty good phone,"Overall, this phone is pretty good except they could have picked better ringtone choices and make the ringer louder."
5,Bought to replace a GE 29897GE2,"This one works like you would expect, and makes me sorry that I didn't look at the reviews before purchasing the terrible GE 29897GE2. I have had the 1855 about a year now, absolutely no problems with it ignoring callers."
4,AT&T 1855 Corded Telephone with Answering System and other nice features,"Great phone. Has easy to use digital answering system, speakerphone, Phone memory storage, easy to customize features. Includes handling of advanced phone company features like Caller ID, Wall waiting, etc.Large, easy to read keypad. The only thing I don't like about it is the too short power pack cord that must always remain attached to the phone, almost relegating it to desk only usage."
4,Works good.,I just got this and so far it has been working great. There is no battery backup and no place for a head set but other than that is does the job.
4,all-in-one telephone,"This phone is quite nice and reliable. The only thing I miss from my previous phone is the multiple, individual voice mail-boxes.Other than this one item, I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a voice-mail, answering machine, speaker-phone built into one unit."
4,A Solid Phone,"I'm not a power user of phones in general, but this phone does what it's suppose to do, and I've never had any issues. Good value for the price."
5,"Speaker is fabulous, not like other models","Everything works fine, including the speaker. I can stand 5 feet away and still hear and speak clearly. So far, so good."
3,Difficult to figure out,"This phone has alot of features, but most of them are so difficult to figure out that I don't use them. The manual is hard to follow if you are not mechanically minded. You cannot use any of the features without reading the manual; nothing is obvious or easy to figure out on your own.This was the only corded phone I could find with an answering machine in the phone, so it does have its' value as they are very difficult to find."
1,Bad Buttons,"I've owned two of these phones. On the first one, the speaker phone mic stopped working, and I returned it. I also noticed the buttons were kinda sticky. I exchanged it for a new one, and the speaker phone worked fine. The buttons on the second one were sticky too, and I thought they would work better over time. I was wrong. The buttons got so sticky the phone became useless. I could no longer dial a number, as the buttons would stick in the pressed position, and enter the number several times. I lost the receipt, so this second phone went in the trash."
4,A good corded phone,"I am quite pleased with the phone. Love the big buttons, and a good easy to use manual to read.Love the volume adjust on all modes of ringing to listening.Just wish it had a lot more minutes of record time,and more favorite dial numbers."
4,An additional phone for Mom,"Mom, 90 years old, already has one of these. This was purchased to provide continuity in the bedroom. The only problem is that they require electric power and don't operate when the power is off. Battery operation would be a plus."
1,Didn't make two years,"The phone quit working properly about 1 year and 6 months after purchased. Since I bought it with my amex card I may get them to extend the warranty. The microphone in the phone must be the lowest quality mic that can be bought as everyone on the other end complained of not being able to hear me, so I ended up having to pick up the reciever way to often. Finally the thing could no longer even record the messages at a consistent volume. That was the last straw since I need to record the incoming messages to another device it became a worthless desk ornament. I hope my extended warranty saves me the cost as I now have to go and buy another phone. A desk speaker phone is not rocket science and AT&T used to be a trustworthy name, no longer all their work apparently goes to the lowest bidder. I feel cheated of both time and money. Their will be no other AT&T products gracing my desk in the near future. Stay away if you are looking for quality that will last, I wish I had."
4,A very good Phone/ Answering Machine - with wires.,"I have 14 rooms and at least 14 phones. Many are wireless, hence battery powered, and hence always going dead for lack of charging. This phone has a wired handset, and a small ""Brick"" power supply that plugs into the wall. It never goes dead (unless the power goes out). It records very clear messages, has caller ID, a speaker phone, and 8 (I think) volume levels. It may not be 2.4 gigahertz, but it is a great phone, of the type that is disappearing. I bought 2 more, as spares. I would give it 5 stars except for the manual. This phone has so many options it needs a book with an index, not a few sheets of paper."
4,WORTH THE PRICE,i found like others that the lcd display is hard to read for the caller ID. the phone works great and well worth the money.
3,Caller ID is hard to see,"This phone works fine and is easy to program for ""memory"" and ""quick dial"" numbers. Unfortunately, even though there are several contrast settings for displaying the caller ID, all of them are difficult to see."
4,Works well enough,"We've had this phone for a month and it works well, except that some characters in the caller id come up funny. Other than that, no complaints. The ringer is maybe a little on the loud side, even on the lowest setting. We turned the ringer off, since we have several cordless phones in the house and we only use this one as an answering machine."
2,Canon Sure Shot 35/80mm Camera - Not So Sure,"I bought this 3 years ago just before a vacation. At the time it was misrepresented as a zoom camera. It is NOT! What it is, is a dual lens camera. This means you have only 2 positions (35mm and 80mm) no other choice. It's not so bad but rather dissapointing when you expected zoom. Now to the type of pictures it takes.This is not my first automatic camera - it is my fourth but the first COMPACT camera I've bought. I must warn you that it has some bugs. Some pics will be crystal clear, others blurred (for not apparent reason), some will be dark even if taken in sufficient light. All I can say is that I was not happy at all with my vacation photos and wished I had taken my heavy clunker automatic Pentax which has never failed me. The only thing I liked about this camera is the size - it weighs almost nothing and fit nicely in my shoulder bag."
2,My First & LAST Canon,"My sons and I purchased A Canon Sure Shot80 for Mom for Mother's Day. It's less than a year old and the time delay between the shutter opening and the time you actually push the button has slowly becoming a joke, but we're not laughing. The moment your trying to capture is lost while it tests the light, zooms and a 2-3 second delay for the flash. Where is a good ole' Yashica FX-2 when you need one? If there is a brand out there that lasts, is quality through and through and you would reccomend it after owning one yourself for a while, please pass me a note at dfjjj@att.net. Thanks"
1,Great for 1 Year,"I bought this camera and was very pleased for about a year until I went on vacation and could not take pictures. The digital display has an H. Instructions do not tell me what that means. I have tried batteries and film, but it will not take pictures any more. I thought the Canon name meant something."
5,My mom loved it.,My mom is a recent breast cancer survivor and I wanted to put together a display case for her and this bear was one of the items I put in it. She absolutely loves the bear and it became the center piece for the display. It arrived on time and was as promised. thank you!
4,Pretty good,"I saw this traditional skinhead soul band in '97 or '98. Their live show was energetic and outstanding. This disc is good, but as is always the case, doesn't quite capture that same energy as a live show. As an Inciters fan, I'd recommend this disc. I can't imagine too many Top 40 music listeners liking this album."
4,plain bar stools,"I needed some stools quickly for staging my home for sale- these were inexpensive and did the job, but aren't terribly comfortable. They were delivered even quicker than the estimate however, so made it here in plenty of time. Overall, they did what I wanted- to suggest the eat-in capabilities of the raised bar in the kitchen."
5,Great Deal,Love this Stool!I seen similiar in Walmart for similiar price - but the quality of these stool are much better than whaty Walmart is selling!Great stool at a great Price!
5,Windsom Wood 30 Inch Barstool,"I needed a barstool to cut my husband's hair. This one is the perfect height, it's very sturdy, and you get two for a great price. I ended up using the second one as a kitchen stool for those long days in the kitchen when you get tired on your feet.n its very simple in design and does not conflict with my kitchen design."
5,Winsome wood barstools,"We love them for their sturdiness. Originally we had metal stools and a leg folded on one of them with me, so I immediate went to Amazon for a better product."
4,Best Live cd,"For my money this is the best live cd for sound, performances and song selection that MSG has ever done."
5,Very Informative.,The book arrived on time and in good condition. It met all my expectations. I'm teaching a Community College course on Big History. The information in this book was very helpful.
3,Burt Reynolds drives his fast car again. All-Star Cast.,"Another Burt Reynolds car-racing movie. Definatly for theSmokey and the Bandit: Pursuit Pack(1977),Hooper(1978) andCannonball Run(1981) crowd. Another all-star cast: Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty, Jim Nabors, Parker Stevenson, Loni Anderson, John Byner, Cassandra Peterson (Elvira, Mistress of the Dark), and many others. There is nothing wrong with your television set. The first four minutes of the movie was filmed off-tint. Out-takes during end credits. Shown in Full-Screen. No extras. No bonuses."
3,Triple Feature: Stroker Ace/Hooper/Sharky's Machine,"Sharky's Machine has been edited; some is missing or my memory is failing.All three are in full screen, but it is all that is available.These will do only until better versions become available, if they ever do.Transfers are adaquate for pan and scan.Don't expect much and you will be okay."
3,racing movie,Burt is himself in this Movie as he is in all his movies. This tends to date it along with the cars. But it is still fun.
3,Intimidator,This movie includes a cameo appearance by Dale Earnhardt.Isn't that enough to recommend it?
2,great topic poorly executed,"I was anxious to get this book and disappointed with it once I opened it. Not very usable. My ""favorite"" photo: a sudsy foot next to a dangerous pile of rocks/shells in a shower stall. Ouch! Imagination is one thing, silliness another. Unfortunately, ideas executed in a ridiculous way give the book an unreal, phony quality. Love the topic but not the book."
1,Not what I was expecting ...,"And unfortunately, I found it very disappointing. I will admit that I was more in the market for a design guide, but this is more of a thought guide -- ways to THINK about your home that will make it a more enjoyable place to live. Yet, the end of each section goes into extremely specific detail (down to measurements!) about the author's ""ideal"" room of that type (kitchen, bedroom, gathering room). The change was both jarring and off-putting for me."
4,A fresh wind through the cells of your soul,"This book is beautifully illustrated and great value for money. The author explains how he has arrived at this work after a serendipitous path in his youth. After creating his own 'special place' in which the burgeoning youth felt secure enough to externalise the process of growth, the adult has now presented the formula for creating our own 'special place', merely by making us conscious of what makes us feel comfortable. A recent and equally wonderful book by Richard Patton entitled ""The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years"" also takes us down the inner path of youth to establish a comfort zone in which the the adult can sally forth into the outer world. Although at face value these books appear poles apart, they are in fact kissing cousins. At their core, both attempt (and succeed) at creating a satisfying meal for the Soul. Depending on how substantial a meal you want - you takes yer choice! Definitely recommended."
2,"One of Buk's worst, I am sorry to say!","Always loved and respected Buk as a unique character in American contemporary Lit. A hand-picked and convinced anarchist who played many games one of his favorites being to present himself as a lumprenproletarian alcos and womanizer (how about a very sensitive and sophisticated writer with fine, fine taste in Literatur & Music?)and yet all good things come to an end. Dear Linda, please stop publishing the leftovers. This book is not worthy of Buk's legacy. Only sporadically a thought a line reminds us of the grand old curmudgeon...and yet forgive me for telling you this. Perhaps the Bukowski book should never end?"
1,Don't Waste Your Money,Had this pump not even two years and it has been nothing but trouble. This unit can not handle 2 inch material. Forget about using even single ply toilet paper. Constant clogging almost everyday. This pump doesn't have enough suction. Alot of the solid waste will hang around in the pit for days. This pump finally died last night. My plumber claims he's never had an issue with this brand. maybe it was defective. I'm buying a wayne pump
3,husky liner,I thought it was going to be a harder liner. It fits good except sometimes I have to push the back part down because with pulling my vacuum out it bends it. Its keeping my carpet clean.
2,Does not fit 2007 Toyota Highlander Hybrid,"It's not a bad product but doesn't fit my Highlander as promised. I expected something closer to the picture used in the description; a tight and custom-like fit., First, it's not big enough so it doesn't cover the gap between the rear seats and cargo area. The lip did not keep it's shape during shipping so the edges are warped and curl. On a routine drive with my dogs in the back, it shifts and slide around quite a bit. If my cargo space was slightly smaller, it would probably work."
5,Outstanding Product,Great quality at an attractive price. Even came with a small felt pouch to store it when not in use.
3,Not bad...,"...but not real good either. Definitely not worth the full price. Short, light on details, and definitely euro-centric. It's not a bad little read, but don't expect a deep examination of aquarium history. Also, the physical construction of the book is curious...it's tall, thin and tightly bound, making it difficult to hold comfortably. The print isn't the darkest or the most legible, and most of the illustrations (which are the best part of the book) are small, although clearly reproduced. This would have made a perfect library book."
1,What do I do with this now,I ordered this and for some reason it will not work with my Toshiba Satellite Laptop. I had to call the manufacture to no avail. Then I had to call Toshiba they also said it should work. Then I took it to a computer store and they said my PC needs a different card?? Amazon dosen't accept returns if the package is opened! Amazon also offers no information on returns. Now I've spent hard earned money for something I have NO use for as well as the firewire I can't use.
2,Future Search,"This book has not been incredibly useful. The authors have some apparently good techniques, however the book is written more like an infomercial. It is as if the book is trying to sell the ""Future Search"" meeting format. I only have the book because I was required to read it for class."
3,A Quick Overview,"This is a quick read, and for under $10 it's a good book to share with your committee when you're planning a Future Search. It describes the process, the roles that will be played by various actors in the process, what to expect and what not to expect. To dissuade me of telling the committee that this was an Organizational Development technique, for example, the authors described the differences between O.D. and the Future Search. I would go ahead and buy ""Future Search: An Action Guide to Finding Common Ground,"" by the same authors, to get the complete picture with the details."
1,Blues and Lamentations,"Kate sings ""Pan Of Biscuts"" almost as well as Hedy West cept of corse her guitars no match for Hedy""s great banjo playing. The rest of kates album is even more disapointing.joel"
5,excellent,"I have purchased this item a month ago and all I can say- I love it!!!! Beautiful, tender color, nice scent... Just what i needed!!! I had the sam eitem few years ago and it is still my favourite lipgloss!! The shipment was very fast as well!!!"
2,where is the first album,The first album has a version of Orange Blossom Special that is cosmic. My vinyl is long gone and no cd or digital to be found. Loved this album.
3,an OK mystery....authors hang-ups show,"I've read a number of Conant's books and initially found them to be entertaining. However, I've gotten more and more irritated with her obsessive negativity about anyone weighing more than 150 lbs and her cartoonish characters. One line in this book about how awful shorts look on anyone weighing more than 150 lbs was particularly grating. Harumpf! It's interesting to read her summarization of Malamutes as well and how she excuses their worst behaviors (dog-dog aggression etc). It's even more amusing to those of us who have chosen a 'better' breed (hey, it's all relative!). Whatever....after this book, I'm not bothering to read any more of her books as Conant's style becomes very annoying with time. Harumpf again...."
1,Unbelievably disappointing,"This book was dreadful; I give it one star only because I respect the fact the woman actually made the effort and published a book. I have my full review of the book on my web site, Collie's Bestiary, but frankly, the Publishers Weekly editorial is absolutely correct."
2,A little dissappointing,"I've read many of the Susan Conant books, but this one I could barely finish, it was sort of boring actually. It seems to me that Holly Winter seems sort of like a lazy like character. Whenever someone insults her, she does nothing.She doesn't seem to show any affection or teddy bear love for her two malamutes. She feeds them and makes sure they don't fight, but other than that she does nothing. I don't think that I've ever read a Susan Conant book where Holly sits down, praises her dogs, and tells them that she loves them. She does a lot with the dogs, but shows little or no ""loving care"" for her dogs.A dog is not an object that can be dissmissed as Holly does.This book is very slow going."
2,She's no Agatha Christie,"After seeking out and buying the entire Holly Winter series, this one -- my first hardcover purchase -- was the one that put me off the series for several years. Agatha Christie originally became famous by breaking one of the cardinal rules of the whodunnit (whoever is the murderer, it's NOT the narrator). In this book Conant breaks a different but even more important rule of the genre, which makes the entire novel pointless. I have not been so unhappy with a novel in this genre since Robert Goldsborough's faux 'Nero Wolfe' novel where the killer commits suicide halfway through the book, and the book continues on anyway. Later volumes in the Holly series recover some of the old magic, but this one is almost a total loss."
2,Let's NOT get to the point,"It's kinda funny how I was introduced to Holly. My girlfriend, Kimmie, really enjoys reading and she would read to me on our one and a half hour trip to work each day. We stared with Susans first Malamute book and proceeded in order. I finished ""Black Ribbon"" this week and was extrememly dissapointed. All Holly did was complain about camp Waggin' Tail. Basically all of the characters were made out to be a thorn in her side. None of the ""regular"" characters had any significant roles. It took me a long time to finish the book, because it just did not keep my attention. I just ordered ""Evil Breeding"". If it is as boring as ""Black Ribbon"", I won't be buying anymore ""Holly"" books."
3,One of her best,"This was one of the best of the dog mystery series that Conant has written. Of course, the reader simply must love dogs more than anything in order to enjoy these books because they are filled with lectures on dog-training, raising, showing - just about anything to do with dogs.This book was better than others simply because it included more information about other people and pets rather than dwelling on Malamutes (which is a marvelous breed, don't get me wrong).It also contained more mystery than dog information, which doesn't happen often in Conant's books. This little detail has never stopped me from reading everything she writes.She is great if you love dogs and just want a book to occupy your time - but not take over your life until you finish."
1,Shaggy Dog Story,"I have liked some of Susan Conant's dog mysteries very much. They have interesting, well-developed plots, believable characters, and well-imagined settings. But some of her dog mysteries, like this one, have little or no plot and flat characters. Some of them are no more than soapboxes for the author to expound her beliefs. This one doesn't preach, for which I was thankful. However, the plot is thin, the narator blithers, the murder happens more than halfway through the story, it's obvious whodunnit, and the story (such as it is) just fizzles out without a satisfying conclusion. It's a shaggy dog story!Ms. Conant is capable of writing a darn good mystery. I wish her editors had asked her to take this one back and re-work it into the good book it could have been."
5,"Mystery, Fantasy or Dream?","No, it seems to be true love, if their website can be believed. In spite of the distance and cultural differences, these two have written an engrossing screenplay, as well as a spirited account of their partnership (professional and romantic). They've offhandedly revealed some insights about the creative process, too."
1,"Boring email, disappointing book","As I said in my review for CREATIVE SCREENWRITING, this book is a one-sided, unfocused conversation that does not live up to its purpose. This is print-on-demand at its worst, a book screaming for the chain saw and vision of an editor. The screenplay itself is not bad for a draft but in no way does this book reveal or clarify the collaborative process in screenwriting. Two thumbs very down."
2,Beware: You Get What You Pay For!,"The $... price tag should have been a red flag. All of Ricky's best songs are here - but they are NOT the original studio versions. It sounds like Mr. Nelson went into the studio during his lunch break and whipped out 22 covers of his own songs. If you've never heard any of Ricky Nelson's songs, you will still enjoy the compilation, but for those who are like me and want to hear the original cuts that made him famous, your money would be better spent buying multiple CD's that contain all of his many great songs in their original flawless versions."
5,Great reference,"You do, of course, need some extensive background on assembly language and basic knowledge computer architecture. If you have that, you'll be treated to quite a wide scope of material. This text is very clear, and the welth of information is staggering. From all Intel chips (alomst all, rather) to chipsets, to support chips to storage hardware. I have just this one book (in addition to some manuals from Intel) and I never needed any more sources.Also, if you need even more info, you can supplement the book with free manuals from Intel."
4,Deserves to be the standard text on PC Hardware,"I'm at a loss as to why Messmer's text hasn't become the standard text on PC Hardware. It's amazingly well-written. The bookshelves in Sydney, Australia don't seem to give this text its due credit ... there're PC textbooks of equivalent content, but not as clear and concise. For anyone considering a PC Hardware book, make sure you include this one in your comparisons."
5,A must,You have to have this book because it contains everything you want to know about your pc's hardware and how to use it.
2,A poor addition to the MegaBloks I'm so accustomed to.,"Two words for you: NO VERSATILTY!!! The limbs on these tiny dragons don't even move! What fun is that?? The dragons are no fun to play with outside of the set, and even that lacks luster. After a while you're kind of like, ""um, so what now?"" The only highlights of this toy is the ""battle magic"" and that the warrior can move its arms, legs, and head and be placed in another set. That's it, plain and simple. Only consider buying if you're a true collector. Seriously, MegaBloks has shown it can be better. (I'm sure you see that I gave the educational value a 4. Well, it does sort of teach a science lesson between magnetic attraction.)"
2,A sincere disappointment,"This set is about as un-Mega Bloks as you can get. There is nothing to build or assemble, the rock pillar cannot be attached to any other set, and the detachable dragon is designed with such a connector piece that he cannot attach to anything other than the rock pillar he comes with.The general idea behind this set is interesting. Magnetic force keeps the dragon's flame levitating above the ice shield, but this gets old pretty quickly. This set has no versatility or room for creativity nor interaction with other sets. It simply stands on its own.Perhaps the only positive aspect of this set is that I like the wizard that is included, and (yes) he can detach and mix with other sets like any Mega Bloks figure."
5,"Though It's Not Really Obscene, It's VERY funny","This wild comic rant about sports is also startlingly original. For hard core sports fans, the book is packed with the kind of fresh insightful analysis of football strategy that is so completely missing from the work of the paid media pundits. (College coaches are already taking this book very seriously, because it shows why they should go for it on 4th down way more than they do.) But for non sports fans, this is also a great book, because Craig Ross really talks more about life than he does about sports -- and he's a fabulously witty writer."
1,Illinois Consumer,"I agree!! This clock/phone is awful! You cannot tell what time it is unless you hit a button to have it light up! What kind of clock is not lit up? The LCD display is awful on the caller ID. Even trying to move the phone around to look at a different angle does not work. I am definitely returning this item. Good idea, but very bad design."
1,"Bad phone, bad clock","This phone is awful! You can't see the display unless you are standing above it, so you can't see the time from bed. The phone sounds so bad that I will walk to the kitchen to answer instead of picking up in the bedroom. Sound is terrible and crackely on both the phone and the radio. Really a poorly made product."
1,Don't buy the Memorex MC2485 Dual Alarm!,"The readout on the alarm is useless as it is not backlit. You must push a button to get the time in the middle of the night. Once you do that, chances are good that you won't be able to see the time anyway unless you lift your head to EXACTLY the right angle.Once I got used to the time problem (I put a small clock with a lit readout next to the phone), the phone itself stopped working (doesn't ring and you can't make a call)! The readout on the phone is bad and also does not light up, which makes it impossible to use at night in an unlit room.I have only owned the phone for 6 months, it is most disappointing to say the least!"
3,Night time problem,"This product has one inconvenient and annoying flaw -- it is not designed to be readable at night. Unfortunately, it has no competition, since I coudn't find an alternative. It is an almost extinct land-line telephone-radio-clock."
4,All-purpose bedside gadget,"A landline phone joined with an AM/FM radio with alarm thrown in makes for a convenient bedside helpmate. I could wish for a backlighted display to make it easier to set the product up and/or make changes, however those are infrequent, primarily for DST. Volume is good as is phone sound. This is a replacement for the same model of several years use, so it has its fans."
3,It's okay,"Can't read the time well, you need to be standing right over top. Can't see time at all if laying in bed. Otherwise the unit works fine."
3,"Useful and Functional just not ""sexy""","That this combination of items, phone, alarm, radio, still exist was a happy find. But baby boomer night vision is not what it used to be and the contrast of the digital read out is difficult to read at night. The angle may be perfect for those who prefer not to be bothered by the light on the clock, but if you are trying to read the clock without sitting up in bed you are out of luck. Everything else works as you would expect. The sound of the alarm is piercing, but if it weren't I would keep dreaming, the radio works like a radio and the phone works like phone. All in all not bad...just not perfect."
3,Clock,Gave it to my husband as a gift to replace a broken clock with a phone. My husband does not like that he can not read the clock at night.Not bright at all.
1,Bad design for a bedside alarm clock,"LCD display can only be read from a standing position; when located on a nightstand beside a bed, the display shows 88:88 when viewed from the bed that is at the same or slightly higher level than the nightstand on which the clock is located. What use is an alarm clock if you cannot see the time from bed?If this telephone is used to take a call while a cordless phone is also being used on that call, a horrible feedback occurs, making the phone line unusable. This interference does not occur with any other phone in our home."
1,Did not like this phone,"I love the features that phone has to offer, but the display for the time is very difficult to see either at night or during the day."
4,Best Seller fiction at its best level,"One of the pleasures of reading this type of commercial novels a long time after they have been published, is that you do not feel like a useful idiot who follows recommendations, made in the Sunday newspapers. If you read it, is usually just because it fell on your hands during a raining afternoon, in which you do not want to watch T.V but you do not want to think about any complex issue either.Here the KGB have discovered a system, whereby the mind of the president of the U.S.A can be pushed towards emotional reactions that will obliterate its rational capabilities. On the other side, the U.S.A. governmental agencies do not have a clue of what is going on. So as usually happens in these books the job to figure out what is going on follows upon the shoulders of a disappointed CIA employee recently divorced, with a big belly, highly critical of its employer but with a great drive towards individualism and imaginative thinking."
4,Jamaican Me Hungry,"I haven't bought the album yet; but reviewing the discography, it is the first discography that actually made me hungry."
5,Great book if you are adding Italian after knowing another romance language,"Between a basic Italian grammar book, some podcasts, and this book, you can really ramp up your understanding of Italian quickly if you have a baseline of other romance languages. Not necessarily a good book for a true beginner without a teacher. Good collection of readings/tasks to keep it interesting.Had it been readily available, I would have preferred ordering the version with the CD (referenced inside the book with a toll free number to call at McGraw Hill...thinking of calling). Book with CD was $19 direct."
2,Easy Italian Reader: A Three-Part Text for Beginning Students (Easy Reader Series),Not what I thought it would be. Thought this was a primer for teaching you italian. Not an entire book written in italian that I cannot read!
4,Worth It,"The format is a little longwinded and you do have to write some of the responses on a separate notebook due to space restraints but it is an excellent starting reader for an Italian 102 0r 103 student. Introduces italian poetry, writing, songs and history. I highly recommend it. Good practice in reading and critically responding to text. There are also some breaks with crosswords and fill in the blanks."
3,Not so easy.,"There is a part of the book which deserves 5 stars for me. It is about the history of Italy. Another large part, maybe half or a quarter, is about ""boy meets girl"" type of thing. I guess a teenager may give that five stars, butfor me two is appropriate. Finally, it should be considered an intermediate reader, not an easy one. Someone starting out in Italian would be upset, and maybe even an intermediate one would be frustrated."
4,NOT that easy,"I agree with the other reviewer, that this book is not easy at all, and the title is misleading. I am an advanced student, having taking 3 years of classes that teach in Italian only. I still get baffled with some of the lessons, even with the first few, which are the easiest. Reading material that is too advanced leads to frustration.Most helpful in reading Italian for beginners, was the series of books by cideb, which include an audio CD with the book. Very helpful, and written for all levels depending on the book.Scoprire I'Italia is great. ISBN: 88-530-0241-7. Check out the others they have for all levels."
5,Fun and practical way to learn Italian,"This is a great book if you want to move from basic grammar and vocabulary to something more engaging. The stories are easy to read, and each chapter has some questions, exercises, and a 'discussion' topic. It's geared toward class settings, but it works quite well for self-study, too. Of course it helps if you have someone fluent in Italian to correct your stories!"
4,An Excellent Overview of the South Asian Society,This book exemplifies the plight of the South Asian Society in the 21st century. It is an excellent overview and depicts something which can be related to anyone living in South Asia. Very Well Done Khushwant Singh!
5,A page turner - and I'm not even Armenian!,"Talk about a page turner! I have no Armenian background, and I read this book in a day. Not only did I learn a lot about another culture, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching Zabelle as she made the most of the cards that were dealt to her. Kricorian's narrative is so descriptive and realistic, it was easy to feel it was all true. (Was it??) It also made me pause as I thought of today's Eastern European refugees..."
2,sleeping pill,to me this book was so boring it literally put me to sleep many times and at the end i stopped reading it.
4,WHY CAN'T THE TRUTH BE WHAT I TELL YOU ?,"I admit I had to laugh during Deray's stand-up routine, but I didn't find his humor over powering. He starts his routine out with discussing rappers in jail. He switches to homeless people then Tiger Woods. From Woods it is an easy jump to discuss relationships and the differences between the sexes.The audience has howling at his jokes.Parental Guide: F-bombs, N-word, calling women the ""B"" word and worse. 3 1/2 stars"
3,Okay,"I liked it, and it was very much funny...it just wasn't so funny to the point till I would cry of laughter though. I actually like Deray Davis though!!"
1,Woefull,"The movie is cleverly placed alongside Nora Roberts movies and I thought I was purchasing a movie based on her book titled Sanctuary. Sadly the acting is so bad in this film (which is not based on Nora Roberts' work), I could not watch more than the first five minutes. I'll be a lot more careful making future purchasing decisions."
4,Good movie considering who made it,"This movie was made by a bunch of high School students. They did a great job, and althogh the movie is a little short, I thouroghly enjoyed it. Great story, and good solid directing by Leonard Carillo. I would recommend this to anyone. Had it been longer, I would have given it 5 stars..."
1,Sanctuary,I just didn't get it. It just went for al little while and stopped. I don't understand. I have purchased many dvd's from Amazon and have never had anything like this. Very unhappy with this. I thought it was based on Nora Roberts' book.
3,Wedding blues,"While Carole Seddon is thrilled that her son, Stephen, is to be married to his girlfriend, Gaby, she is puzzled by the way in which Gaby's parents, Marie and Howard Martin seem to want to keep the event as low key as possible. Marie is a pale, wan creature with a habit of fainting if the slightest thing disturbs her. Following the couple's engagement party, Howard is picked up in a strange car which is found the next day, burned out and with his body inside. The Martin family is found to have connections to another murder which was carried out in just the same way, 30 years before, with the accused man having just been released after serving his full sentence. Carole delves into the secrets of this strange family with the help of her friend and neighbour, Jude, and uncovers murky pasts for several members of the family. It was an ok read, but not a book to keep me up into the small hours."
4,A great afternoon read,"I really enjoyed this book. The plot was interesting and the characters are different. Simon Brett has created two women neighbors/friends/sleuths who completely different from one another, and I enjoy reading about them."
5,readable and informative,"A well-written study of the rise of the modern Hindu nationalist movement in relation to Rajiv Gandhi; including ways he distanced himself and ways he tried to pander to them to retain power.The book is actually broader than the title suggests, beginning with Indira Gandhi and the events leading up to her assassination, and looks at how Hindu nationalism revived after the assassination of Rajiv.Written from a journalist's perspective, the narrative moves smoothly and coherently at all times.If you are interested in modern Indian history, politics or religion, this book gives you a nice picture of this period of time (around 1984-1994), to help you understand how things in India got the way they are now."
3,Interesting study,"The author makes a point to talk of her struggle with her voice in the introduction, and one only hopes that other dissertations have more of a voice. The scholarship is sound, the subject interesting, but the style is dry. Sorry if you think I'm being cruel, but the writer has to consider the reader. And keep him awake."
4,A Liz Not Like Any Other,"This movie absolutely made my jaw drop to the floor. This is a Liz Taylor that really freaked me out. It's one of those artistic movies that makes you want to stop the DVD because of not knowing what the heck is going on, and yet, you just can't stop looking. You get deeper and deeper into it and it takes you to total exhaustion as you study the world of a mentally challenged woman. The ending is brutal and shocking and is not for the squeamish. When the movie was over, I applauded Ms. Taylor for challenging herself in this very morbid and unconventional movie."
2,Liz was gorgeous but movie was not so good,"When Liz passed this year, I bought many that I had never heard of before. This one was ok - she was so pretty - but not so keen on the story line."
1,horrible beyond belief,"Liz Taylor went through a period of her career when she made atrocious movies, and this one of them. It is about a crazy woman who is apparently going to a sanitorium-spa after yet-another nervous breakdown. She is traveling through Italy, but there is terrorism everywhere. We get a lot of flashbacks, which confuse more than elucidate. Andy Warhol makes some appearances, and he is just too creepy. Liz screams in that nasal fishwife way of hers. She thinks every man wants to have sex with her. The ending was supposed to be some kind of shocking explanation, but I was hoping it might come 45 minutes earlier than it did. If you are exploring the complete canon of La Liz's opus, save this one for last because you will hate it...and her. The DVD version I got had horribly bleached-out colors and was often unwatchable. Do not waste your time and money on this one."
2,No firmware for Toshiba 1415-S173,"Installed it but Toshiba 1415-S173 did not recognize it (IDE #1 Error). Through web site, Toshiba laptop required either firmware or 45 & 47 pin connection for changing master/slave cable. I requested the firmware to seller but I did not get any response yet..."
3,FIRMWARE,Please bear in mind that the firmware for this device is not easy to find and vendor takes time to email back. Still on the fight...
1,Not for small keys,I needed something to use on keys slightly smaller than a door key. These would not hold my keys at all.
3,key attachments,these items are not the sturdiest. the plastic twists and in the hands of a person with arthritis they can be too slippery. Maybe a hard rubber may be better i do not know.the vender delivered the product as promised quickly and it can as described. I just found it impractical for my situation.thank youmarshall
5,An excellent method book,"I am a longtime quilter and have a VAST library of quilting books, some I bought just to look at the pictures. (You other quilters know what I mean.) But this book is one I come back to time after time. It is well thought out, logical in presentation, gives the quilt maker a variety of sizes of blocks to choose from and a variety of sizes to make. It is a must have for any beginner. I bet I've made at least 10 single and double irish chain quilts just using this book. I have taught classes using this book and recommended it to my students to purchase. It is the one book in my library I'll never be sorry I bought."
1,It should be illegal to sell such a poor quality DVD,"An excellant A+++ performance by Ms. Tyson which was ruined by the worst quality DVD I have every seen. 50% of the scenes were so black as to been unable to distinguish the characters ( it was like trying to watch radio) and the other 50% were washed out, full of glare, and unfocused. This was truly a diaster. My advice DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS DVD... WAIT FOR A BETTER TRANSFER"
3,Poor transfer-wonderful drama,This is an important drama with a great performance by Ms. Tyson. Unfortunately the film? videotape? from which the DVD was made was in very poor condition I must assume. The colors are bleached out and the picture is very fuzzy throughout. If the DVD was made from the only materials in existence I can understand. Otherwise let's make a new DVD!
4,Great Educational Tool,"Okay, maybe the picture is a little dark. But it's an incredibly complete picture of Harriet Tubman's life! My 5th garders learned so much from it."
3,Excellent Movie / Poor Quality,"This is an excellent movie, very poor quality. The other viewers are right, this movie needs to be retouched or something. Anything that will make the picture quality better. The movie is really great for the whole entire family to watch.Lynn, OKC"
1,The DVD is so dark you can barely see many of the scenes,"The DVD is so dark you can barely see many of the scenes. It's like a 1940's movie copied from a television show onto a DVD. Bad, bad, bad! The producers ought to be embarrassed!"
4,Harriet Tubman,"The quality of the CD was okay, but it is an old movie. I had not seen this in a very long time and enjoyed watching it again."
3,A MUST SEE,"They never showed how many of the slaves were killed by various means. However this film certainly portrayed Harriett Tubman played by Cicely Tyson, as a strong spiritual military black woman who was very much connected to the Most High in prayer. As such she was told when to make her moves to help her people escape from their captors. This is a memorable film of the bondmen and bondwomen mentioned in Deuteronomy 28v67-68. DEFINITELY worth seeing by all."
2,BAD PICTURE!!!!!!!!,"THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT SHOW WELL...QUALITY OF THE PICTURE IS NOT GOOD...IT'S BLURRED AND NOT CLEAR, HOWEVER, THE PRICE WAS GOOD. PLEASE BE AWARE CONSUMERS."
1,DVD didnt even work,"Dvd didnt even play on several different dvd players and the item was supposedly new, still in the package. Highly disappointed!"
5,Great Book!!,This is a great childrens book! It has amazing pictures of an extremely talented dog with a cute storyline to go along with it. Highly Recommended!!
5,Best sea kayak reference book for my students,"I've taught Coastal Kayak for 11 years as an ACA certified instructor. I used to recommend Johnson's ""Sea Kayaking: A Woman's Guide"" to all new paddlers, because she addresses fears head on, while male authors may ignore or gloss over them. When she published the first edition of ""The Complete Sea Kayakers Handbook,"" I felt no hesitation to recommend it to men as well as women. With this 2011 update, I feel it is the best and most current reference for all beginner to intermediate sea kayakers. It is the only general book on the subject that has my whole-hearted endorsement."
4,Relatively comprehensive.,"This book provides a solid introduction to the requirements of open water kayaking. It will at least get you to the point of asking the right questions, always a plus when one begins shopping.Also gives some insight into kayak manners, a big plus."
4,"It's PEARL JAM, it's GOOD","this is a great book that tells the story of the band as well as has some great, kicking pictures! i definately suggest this book for any member of the PEARL JAMily. Keep on rockin' in the free world!"
3,Alexander before becoming the Great,"This a wonderful account of Alexander's childhood and adolescence. It was a wonderful account of his father (King Philip)struggling to build the Macedon kingdom which sets up Alexander for greatness.We all know that Alexander became the Great, but there's no need to keep on reminding us throughout the novel of his brilliant mind, handsome face etc. Is there no flaw at all to his character?"
2,not very good,"I picked this up hoping for something in the vein of I, Claudius. I suppose I was setting this up for a fall, but I didn't expect it to be so bad. It soon became clear that the author just isn't very good at dialogue. Some of the problem is undoubtably due to the translation, which is almost childish in places. Beyond that, I found it a bit unnecesary to have details about Olympia's cleavage included while important plot points were glossed over.I quickly started reading with only the thought of getting a light historical background to Alexander, and skimmed over the most embarassing parts of the prose."
4,A perfect choice,"This book is perfect in light of my price range. The description was correct, and I recieved the book much sooner than expected. I am very pleased with my choice."
5,an insightful and brilliant novel,"The book retells Alexander's childhood and adolescence, growing up in the Macedonian city of Pella and moving to the town of Mieza, where he commences his studies with Aristotle as a tutor. Manfredi utilizes a great amount of detail and creates fantastic images. The novel includes suspense, allowing the reader to lustfully engage him/herself. The adventures of Alexander are told in way, evoking sympathy and coompassion and bringing the protagonist of the novel close to heart. I recommend this great book to all people interested in an exciting story of a powerful boy with infite power and a great future ahead, aswell as readers interest in historical information of this era."
2,Not nearly as good as Renault.,"Perhaps much was lost in translation, so I shouldn't bash Manfredi too much. However, I simply could not get passed the rabid womanizing of Alexander. I accept that from Philip, after all he did have seven wives, countless romances with women and men, and was killed by an ex-""favorite."" I just didn't feel Alexander in this book. In Renault's novels you get a sense of a genius trapped in the body of a child. In Manfredi's book, all I got was petulance, vulgarity, and womanizing. Again, it could all have been lost in the translations. I'd read it, but in the end, stick with Renault."
3,An ancient soap opera,"While this book is very informative and teaches you a lot about Alexander and the ancient world, I couldn't help thinking that it was a little more than an ancient version of Melrose Place.What I found very interesting was how the author goes into detail describing Alexander's sexual encounters with women but glosses over his male lovers. Okay, if he was bisexual that is fine, but why treat the homosexual love and affairs differently from the hetero love? It's almost as if the author felt that the reader couldn't handle knowing too much about that area of his life.As stated in another review, it is stupid that this book was broken up into 3 volumes. It would be much better as a long, thick novel. I will read the other two but because my local library has teased me with only having the first volume in their collection, I now have to wait for the other two."
4,Hmmm...,"The first part in the trilogy, Alexander: Child of a Dream is possibly the best of the three, at least better than the second part.You start with the circumstances surrounding the great Alexander`s birth, and carry on from there. Be forewarned however, that this book only covers Alexanders early life and childhood. It makes a very interesting read, but is NOT historically exact. The writer has greatly expanded upon current knowledge of Alexander in order to make the book interesting and transform it from a historical tome to a very nice novel. It provides a good basic knowledge of Alexander, in a fictional form.If you`re going to be too critical, avoid it; it will make you groan. If you hunger for whatever you can get about Alexander, or have some idea of him and want a good book which will teach you more, read it. If you`re just a bit bored and want a good book to read, read it. You`ll like it."
4,Pretty Good! Great for a first buy!,"I had already heard several songs from the Japanese release CAPTAIN'S BEST, which are on this album. The ones I hadn't heard weren't quite as good. If you already own the CD mentioned above, it's not as notable. It does, however, stand well on its own. Songs that definitely make this CD worth purchasing are: IKO IKO, U LIKE IT, 1-2-3, TE QUIERO and an interesting cover of YELLOW SUBMARINE. These tracks (out the total 15) alone make this CD a good purchase. If you're new to Captain Jack or have heard his music from Konami's many ""Dance"" series, this is a great place to start. There is also a 2000 Japanese release of the same name, with a slightly different track listing. In any case, give it a try! Once again Captain Jack uses many different styles to accomplish one very important thing: GREAT DANCING!!"
3,"From one who professes not to be classical, it is!","The artists perform Mozart in pure form intermingling an interesting rythm and soundfest. Pleasent, though not profound, the CD is quite enjoyable."
3,Pleasant Mexican Revolution action-comedy,"Julio Aleman, appealing as always, plays the titular character, a genial screw-up who finds himself in the midst of intrigue, romance and comic action during the Mexican Revolution. Ably supported by sidekick Luis Aguilar and lovely Norma Lazareno, this is pleasing, lightweight wartime romp in the vein of the Quirt & Flagg movies. Enjoy!"
4,Not a step-by-step tutorial,"A great concise treatment of techniques from the master. But be warned that this is not a step-by-step tutorial. Unfortunately, the 'Look inside' feature does not show a single excerpt.The chapters start of with a little introduction, there is a figure accompanying every technique and a short description of the technique. Think of it like having anecdotes for each figure.This is a book for an 'advanced beginner', who wants to reflect upon his skills so-far by comparison and try out some of the ideas that this book offers."
4,Bruce Maccabee is a legitimate UFOlogist,"When trying to choose a book about UFOs, you may not know how to avoid the flaky ones. This is a thoroughly researched and well written book, and a must-read for anyone beyond the initial stages of reading on UFOs. Bruce Maccabee is a solid, methodical investigator with years of background in UFO studies.This book is not about abductions; it does not engage in any far out speculation. It is about evidence of government agencies' involvement of UFO matters over several decades--evidence gathered straight out of government files, mostly from FBI and Air Force Intelligence files, but also from the files of other agencies."
3,They know more than they are telling us,"The facts are all there - the point made - the authorities have known for a long time. Yet more compounding evidence that we should all be aware of - UFO's are real, they are here and Bruce takes us through the evidence rather convincingly. Read it"
2,Disappointed Again,"I suppose that I expected more interesting data in this book by Mr. MacCabee and although we read about good sightings by credible people and letters by F.B.I. and the Air Force, they are not that ""one"" we are looking for. In a nutshell, Bruce relates many of the events that happened during the 50's and 60's, tells of the ""Blue Book"" organization , the ""Sign"" and ""Grudge"" groups set up to investigate the UFO reports but after reading the book one thing stands out: The men in charge knew that the UFOs were not from any place on Earth and could only be from Outer Space but the Air Force whose job it was and is to protect us from all aerial forces...would NOT accept this solution.It seems that a ""think tank"" advised the United States Government several years ago to never admit that the UFOs were from another world, so that seems to be the way it will be... untill an Alien spacecraft lands on the White House."
5,It's Star Time with JB at The Apollo! The best Funk Record!,Wow. What a marvelous surprise. The nicest series ever (Universal's Deluxe Edition series) continues with James Brown's most important chapter. Live At The Apollo is know as the greatest funk album ever and this edition reinforces that ever-more. In the true order (props to Harry Weinger and Alan Leeds) and with bonus material. 2-CDs finally done the right way. And this one has enough material to justify it. Beautifully designed!
5,I Wake Up... In a Cold Sweat!,James Brown breaks the funk down at the Apollo! Baby he will stir you like a cube of sugar in some strong black tea. I Got You Baby- and if you've got the funk- Get this CD!
3,Should have left well-enough alone,"Get the original version of this album, rather than the remastered version. The first is tight and powerful; the second adds a bloated, interminable version of ""It's a Man's Man's World"" and some tepid instrumentals for his back-up dancers. If you buy the remastered version, you'll be hitting the skip button more often than you should on a live James Brown album."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"While James is terrific as usual,I have to agree with other reviewers that the sound quality on much of this release is so disappointing that I am going to put my copy on ebay just to get it out of here without tossing it in the garbage."
4,Dirk's vibes bring life to smooth jazz tracks,"With help from Jeff Lorber's production and keyboards, Dirk Richter's 1997 debut demonstrates the vibes are a viable lead instrument in the smooth jazz genre, capable of invoking a sultry tropical groove or slick urban jungle funk. Contributing to a steady, solid groove throughout are session aces such as bassists Jimmy Johnson and Jimmy Haslip, drummer Carlos Vega, and percussionist Luis Conte. Co-producer Randall Crissman's electric guitar also provides a notable foil with several burning solos. ""Smooth Move"", the lead-off track, is reprised with a radio-edit version, and features the most compelling and memorable melody of the ten compositions."
4,Looks great.,"Looks solid. The pegs are a lot longer than it appears in photos, but otherwise, I like this clothes peg."
3,Nice looking but a bit snug,"I purchased this bustier in 34A (way to hard to find in stores). It looked great but the cups were a bit unflattering and did not have enough structure to hold up my wedding dress (which is why i bought the bustier). Also, the waist of the busiter was a bit snug (more so than other 34's which I had tried on) so I had to return it and exchanged for another style. But overall it looks good."
4,15 Minutes Alone with God,"Many devotionals are too brief, being only a few paragraphs long. These daily readings are a few pages each, so they have more meat to them. Each devotion begins with a scripture reference followed by Emilie's application of the scripture, some suggested action steps, and a brief prayer. In the scripture applications, Emilie focuses on her personal experiences and experiences in the daily lives of most women. She encourages readers to apply God's principles in their roles as wives, mothers, friends, and professionals. I have recommended this book to many women, and I passed my copy along to a friend. I wish more devotionals followed this format."
4,Scary story,"I picked this up at a used book store and it was well worth it. As a mom, I found this book very scary. I couldn't wait to see how it would come out in the end. I highly recommend it!"
3,a rollercoaster of good and bad writing,"This book is like riding a roller coaster - not because of its thrills, but because sometimes it is very poorly written and sometimes it is really quite good.The author does a pretty good job of making you wonder why this boy is singled out by the kidnapper - but when I found out why I didn't really buy it. His attempts at escape are interesting but the FBI agents are pretty lame (the female agent is hyper-concerned at being treated as an equal but is always having heart palpatations when her cute boss stands near her).So, it is a choppy read."
2,¡No son los Humildes!,Este CD dice que es de los Humildes pero no lo son. En realidad no se quien interpreta estas canciones de Juan Gabriel. Si no fuera porque costó barato lo habria mandado para atrás para que me regresaran el dinero. Que mala onda que dice que son los auténticos Humildes y en realidad es una farsa. Totalmente desatisfecho.
5,Knaak you are the best!,"Thanks Knaak for this wonderfull masterpiece, it's full of action and adventure.Please, followers or not of Diablo, read this book! And be sure to read Diablo 1 and Diablo 2 books first."
4,Good,"Compared to the black road and legacy of blood, its not as good, but still a great read and worth it. I'd give it 3 stars but humbart was alone worth 1 star. I freaking love that skull. He makes the funniest comments. Cant wait for moon of the spider!"
4,Contemporary Folk Songs - A Truly Unique Voice,"Malcolm Holcombe's low, gritty voice is the centerpiece of this album. Production is restrained, allowing Holcombe's acoustic finger-picking, light percussion and layered guitar to set a relaxed foundation. These are really well-written songs that will fit well in your Contemporary Folk collection. I have lost track of Holcombe's more recent releases but plan to track these down. Stay tuned for updates. GENRES: Contemporary Folk.BUY IF YOU LIKE: Steve Forbert, Greg Brown.MUST HEAR TRACKS: ""Justice in a Cradle,"" ""Teaching Michael Anthony,"" ""Spinnin' Roll On."""
3,A good start,"Exercises were OK, but a little sparce. It would have helped to have more verbal support and suggest what was to be gained by each."
5,I have been SEARCHING for this game!,"A little over a year ago my roommate had this game, we had a great time playing it (kids and adults) Ever since he moved out I have searched for it. Great fun 4 all. Easy enuff for the younger children and entertaining enuff for adults too...plus each level you complete gets you fine masterpiece painting, my 7 year old saw a picture @ doctors office and said, ""Hey! That's by Van Gogh."" So it's even slightly educational..lol."
1,yuck,"what the heck, what kind of game is this. this game was so boring i fell asleep playing it. do not waster your money on this game."
3,"Vocals are all there, but songs fall short","It's always great to hear Russell Hitchcock wail away as he does on earlier songs like ""Making Love Out Of Nothing At All,"" and ""The Power Of Love."" His voice is in top form, as is Graham Russel's more mellow voice--the vocals are beautiful (that's why I give this 3 stars instead of 2). The songs just aren't there, on this one, though. They are kind of weird, new-age sounding...just didn't do anything for me. This is one for die-hard Air Supply fans only."
2,Lighter Than The Air,"Air Supply is an Australian duo which dominated charts during early 80s with powerful emotional vocal and harmony. Their 1997 comeback effort in contrast become much more milder and lighter and lack the impact and intensity they used to deliver during 80s. Some tracks are plain soft smooth light soothing pop and the a few memorable tracks include WE THE PEOPLE and SO MUCH LOVE. You can enjoy this album if you like Bee Gees or Brian Wilson.Verdict: Well I still cannot fully get used to their changes just as it happened to Bryan Adams, Asia, Richard Marx and so...Rating: 53 out of 100. Some are nice in its own right some lack vigor.Recommended for: Die hard fans and smooth pop fans."
3,Great piece of work.,"I remember buying this album on the day of it's release. I was able to get a few days early as I worked at a record store and was very excited at the thought of a new album from Air Supply. I was not dissaponted. ""So Much Love"" is a beautiful song that is destined to be a classic Air Supply song as well as many other gems from this disc. The debate of Russell's voice will continue. He has lost his trademark powerful vocals but is still the Russell Hitchcock that we know and love. The man is getting older and so is his voice. Accept it or be destined to listening to only 80's Air Supply records and being closed minded. This album is very good other than the final track ""All That You Want"" which is OBVIOUSLY a filler song to extend thr album a little. Could have deleted that last track."
2,It's alright,"I'm a fan of Russell and his up tempo, emotion sparking ballads. This is a great album if you're a fan of Graham. I couldn't get interested in it, except for, ""So much Love"", but I can only listen to that one so much. Still a pretty good LP though"
5,The Gremlins,I remember that my Grandmother gave me this book shortly after WW2 when I was about 11 or 12. I fell in love with it and was sorry that it got lost somewhere. To find it again and see the original drawings (just as remembered) and the story was wonderful. Thank you for this treasure.
4,The Gremlins Book,"While this is a good book, I can see why it was never made into a movie. Bugs Bunny had a much funnier cartoon with his Gremlin.This is an interesting book and teaches a lesson on cooperation and friendship. It's not a laugh-out-loud book; it's more thoughtful and insightful, going into how we need each other to accomplish a common goal.I recommend it but not for very young readers."
1,Lacks Dahl Magic,"I'm a Roald Dahl fan but this book doesn't come close to being as good as his other stories. It reads like a rough draft of an idea he had that was never fully developed into a finished story. I'm amazed Disney decided to have it published.The characters are flat. You never really like or dislike the gremlins, even though they are supposedly an enemy of the airforce, but later become friends. And Gus, and airforce pilot, is stupid and dull. Dahl has other stupid and dull characters in other stories but they are usually the villans and are presented with delicious, twisty Dahl humor. In The Gremlins, Gus is supposed to be a hero. The biggest disappointment was the lack of Dahl's signature humor. The story lacks so much of what you normally expect in a Dahl tale I kept asking myself with disbelief, ""this is a Roald Dahl story?"""
2,Not Seuss's best.,"This book is mostly an excuse for Dr. Seuss to list off a variety of wild and fanciful sorts of birds. That aspect is cute, as per Seuss's usual, but there's not much else to the book. Meanwhile, the driving theme--taking eggs from the nests of very rare birds in order to make scrambled eggs with them--seems so blindingly unethical to the modern eye that it becomes difficult to enjoy the inventive imagery. There's a reason this book is not one of Seuss's better-known works."
1,Jumps to completely irrational conclusions,"Seriously, breaking down John Lennon's song ""Imagine"" and comparing each verse to ""Marx's teachings"" is no concrete proof of a new world order conspiracy. All through the book the author takes metaphorical quotes from historical individuals literally to illuminate his claim that every event from the last 300 years (as of 1985) was a conspiracy. If you're looking for a real revisionist historical perspective (U.S.-centric, I mean) read Howard Zinn's ""People's History of the United States,"" instead of this rubbish."
5,"I was very skeptical 15 yrs ago, but not now!!","Dear Fellow Americans, I first read this amazing book over 15 yrs ago and thought it sounded logical, but I just could never belive it to be true. Now 15 yrs later, I believe everyword in it. It is one of the most reseached with citations referenced books I have ever read. It will open your eyes to what is explain and to understand what is happening around us now."
4,Scary but good read,I am only half way through the book but it is already giving me sleepless nights thinking of what might have been prior to WW 1 and 2 and the lives that might not have been lost. Need to check accuracy on Scopes.
4,What is the Illuminatii,Un-nerving but well documented expose of the hidden government.Puts a lot of things together.
5,Great History Source,"This book will answer many questions raised by the official history we have all learned. Many historical events fit a pattern and if you are looking for some facts to complete the puzzle of history, this is the book to read."
4,The final reality,"This is a good book to learn about what is really going on in this world. Ralph scratches the surface and reveales the hidden agenda that the builders have committed themselves to. I have only one problem, he amasses such a freightful image to the reader, and gives a weak solution to the problem. I believe there is no solution. All of this was foretold in scripture. I have a solution, live you're life according to the laws of god then act like today is you're last day on the earth!"
4,Historically sound overview of hidden history,"RE walks the reader through human history from the perspectiveof a Christian conspiracy theorist. Though his conclusions maybe radical, skeptics will be hard-pressed to deny that his factsare solid. He has collected an expansive amateur study ofwestern history which suggests the influence of ""unseen"" forcesin mankind's path to globalism. If only as a method to relearnhistorical events from a different perspective, I recommendthis book to anyone who has suspected that those in power, despitethe rhetoric, have always had self-serving and sinister intentions.In many ways a precursor to Jack Flannel's multi volume historicalrecord, RE's Unseen Hand remians a fine review of western history ina useful and engaging format. Check it out!"
1,Terrible,"I had such high hopes for this book. I was overjoyed when it arrived. Unfortunately, it is poorly written and based on misconceptions about the beliefs and intentions of the founding fathers. This book has STRONG Christian overtones, and the author takes his beliefs about god to a shocking level. It almost feels intrusive. As a person who considers herself a humanist, I was deeply disturbed by the content of this book. The Unseen Hand is completely and absolutely insipid. If you are a rational human being seeking answers, I strongly advise you to look elsewhere.I am so disappointed."
4,"A charming Regency tale, worth reading more than once.","For those who love the Regency period, it isalways a pleasure to find a new author who doesjustice to the genre. Ms. Miller's first book has anadmirable heroine, a blunt bluestocking a little onthe plump side, and a duke whose lofty proprietyoccasionally gives way, no doubt due to anunknown thatchgallows hidden somewhere in hisancestry. The strongest secondary charactersinclude the hero's secretary, and the chinless heir,who comes through with sufficient chin andbackbone when he is most needed"
4,The Duke's Dilemma,"The romance entitled The Duke's Dilemma was a very enjoyable read. The story was well written. If you enjoy a Cinderella story with a happy ending, this book is for you."
4,From the Front Lines: Student Cases in Social Work Ethics (2nd Edition),This item was described perfectly it arrived in a timely manner and i am pleased with the senders quality.
2,BORE-ING,"I have enjoyed other Kobialka albums, but this one is drawn out and tedious. He even makes me dislike the Gymnopedies."
1,Order Cancelled?,"Ordered 5 of these, the number indicated in stock at the time of order, only to have the order cancelled by 're-stock-it'. No reason given - another item ordered (from a different vendor) on this same Amazon order shipped as promised. The vendor could have emailed me if he only had 3 or 4 of these left in stock. I'd been happy to get even 1 them shipped against the PO."
5,Plug breaker replacement for plug fuse,It fits ... it's working ... hopefully it will do it's job when and if there is an overload. So far ... so good!
2,Good Product BUT Wrong Product,"I don't like to give a low rating - however - the product is good...well made and is easy to install with the 3M double back tape that comes installed on the protectors themselves.My problem: I ordered by 'It fits your vehicle' and, well, I doesn't. It is for a Super Crew '08 and I have a Super Cab '12 - I should have cross checked with Auto Ventshade website and I didn't...the good thing is that the front longer sill protector fits the front door area of my '12 and that is the area I was more concerned about protecting. Just beware and cross check auto part numbers with the manufacture's websites & Amazon."
1,Item received had a broken spool holder,"I received this item but one of the spool holders was broken off. I didn't return it because it's too much trouble to re-package and re-mail, etc."
1,Not worth the $$$$,I didn't find this useful as the 'statistics' presented werte more subjective and less useful than the usual baseball numbers. This book may be useful for some but it was not useful to me.
2,Disappointing read,"Others like this book, but my view is in opposition. The unanswered question, to me, is ""What's the difference?"" You may find yourself a more knowledgable fan after reading this book; I did not.Statistical significance at the .30 level seems to me to be not significant."
4,Makes you wonder,This book bescribes Moses being protected by a u.f.o when the Red sea is seperated and the burning bush might have been extaterrestrial influenced. This book is filled with close encounters in the Bible that might have been aliens. This book is worth a read.
1,Pass on this one...,This is the only book in my collection that I did not bother to finish. I have been reading on the subject since my early youth but this book could not retain my attention. It seemed repetitious at times and simply put...boring. I will end up using it as filler material for the bottom of my book shelf.
4,This game is cool,"Breath of Fire 3 is a game where you play the role of Ryu and on your adventure you learn to transform into a dragon and you meet strong allies and strong enimies during the quest, the plot makes it pretty cool and you get to build your own city sound cool try it"
3,Basic RPG,"I have never played any of the games from the Breath of Fire series before, but I would never buy another one if they were anything like this one. It is and okay game over all but is missing some key elements of a good RPG. It's story line wasn't that great. I found it a little hard to follow in the beginning and the characters were not that great. The main character doesn't even talk. But I did like how the battle mode was controlled. It was easy to learn and fun to fight enemies. I would recommend a few games before it but if you are looking for a fun and easy RPG to pass some time, I recommend it."
1,one of playstaions best,"this is an excellent game that really has some substance! the graphics are not the best and it is oversahdowed by the bigger game final fantasy VII. if FF7 was too long for you, get breath of fire 3. the story is good and the battle system is great!"
3,Not as fun as I thought,"This was my first playstation game and let me say I have been a big fan of the BOF series but this game lacked what I wanted in a video game I mean it had good graphics,but it kinda was missing something in the plot it just seemed I was doing the same thing for hours and hours. This game cut out some of the things that made BoF so intresting such as in this game you can't fly with Nina, which when you can't fly around u just walk around the same land just getting bored, believe me if your one of those people that want to finish the game to see what happens you'll be very upset. But this is my opinion but if your still compelled to but this game let me give you some word of advice ""Buy the Walkthrough guide or you'll be one angry gamer"""
4,Buy me!,"Good video but in all honesty, poor instructional value. Vic goes in depth into only two of his techniques (thumb up/down & tapping) and when he shows you the basic technique he flies away doing something much more complex than anything you'll ever do. The interviews are all the same interviews you've read in every bass magazine or seen in another video so you won't learn anything new or profound during those either. But you get to see him lay down the law on his bass which is ALWAYS exciting. However, sometimes you see his plucking hand while his fret hand is doing all the work and vice versa, and when his brothers solo you never get to see what they're doing, you see Vic playing. Oh well, at least it's not as bad as that ridiculous Making Music video where you don't see any of the soloists until they're done soloing! Overall though, a killer video if you can stifle your laughter at Victor's jerry curl and lame pants. Almost as good as Bass Day '98."
5,the best decision i ever made,"If you know what a bass is, u know that victor wooten is the best out there. all other reviews of this video, bashed it. but i still bought the video because victor is my idol. To me, the video was extremly informational. it enters you into the world of wooten. and gives extordinary insight on how to perform like him. dont listen to the other reviews, if you are serious about the bass, this video will definatly advance your playing. i havent seem bass day 98 yet, so i know i will love that even more."
2,Another generic video,"This video is a good video, except it is bland and generic. I was expecting more along the lines of something original, but I have to say it is everything but. I recently picked up the new Alan Kropf bass technique video, and it blew me away. I expected another hit from Victor Wooten, considering his status, and I was let down. If you never have seen a Victor Wooten video it is ok. I recommend Alan's new video more though."
4,funky,In this video you can see how funky Victor is. He really has his bass on the pocket. Also he shows a lot of dazzling melodies with his tapping technique. You can pick up some ideas for a bass solo.
2,Big Disappointment.,"I really thought that it would be a good reference book but it wasn't set up that way. The book is divided into 4 sections: Time, Man, Space and Allegories covering 71 topics. In each section, two pages are devoted to one topic such as ""garden"". Every topic is listed in the back of the book, but not alphabetically so you cannot look up the symbolism for a topic such as ""doves"" (which is not in the book) without going through the whole book. Also, there are many topics not covered in the book.The book is only 5 "" wide x 8"" tall, so the text and reproductions of the artwork are quite small. It is almost impossible to see the detail in some larger works of art such as Michelangelo's The Last Judgment. But on a positive note, they were very broad in their selection artworks from different periods."
4,"Great hooks, fun music","I saw this band live, and I can say they were just as good live as they are on the CD .... there's no major dubbing on this album .... good Veruca Salt-like fun ...."
5,LUV IT!!!!,"As soon as I heard ""Letters to Cleo I was hooked! I had trouble finding any references to the band BUT I wasn't put out coz some ultra-talented people out there have made varius cleo sites! Check them out! Also ""10 things I hate about you"" has loads of cleo songs!! I luv it!!!!By KAT.H"
4,"Upbeat, bouncy","If you like Letters to Cleo then this is a winner. Very upbeat 90's alternative sound, nice to listen to if you're in a good mood on a sunshiny day."
4,Go Ahead And Give It A Buy,"Letters to Cleo were a chick fronted alt band from the early nineties that combined elements of shogazing bands like My Bloody Valentine with the crunch of harder alt bands like sheer and the pop sensibility of Jesus Jones. Success proved as elusive For Letters To Cleo as it did for like-minded artists Certain Distant Suns and Eve's Plum. They were pretty good at what they did; the musical mainstream just didn't bite. They definitely sound of their times today, but the album will be a sure hit for fans of the genre or those who are nostalgic for the times."
5,"God, I miss them....","I started following Letters To Cleo in 1994 after they played the first WBCN River Rave here in Boston (which now includes bands such as Metallica). I had gone to see Better then Ezra, and LTC stole the show. I own all of the albums minus Ten Things. Kay's solo work is good, and there are similarities (with Michael helping with the writing and all) but sadly it's not the same. The last time I saw them was at the CD release party for this album where they shut down a block in downtown Boston and rocked out at lunchtime....oh, wait, I'd never skip school to see a great concert from a great band....lol:-). Anyways...buy this album and Aurora Gory Alice and you'll be pleased but if you really want to rock out, check out Wholesale!!!! It's a much edgier album. And Kay, if you should happen to read this.....please at least think of getting the band back together!!!!!"
3,an extra- not a priority,"I initially bought this CD because I loved the lead vocalist after hearing her on the ""Josie and the Pussycats"" soundtrack. I was disapointed with ""Go"", however. I feel it lacks any sort of varying emotion and doesn't move me at all. While the songs are upbeat and cheerful, after the first few tracks they begin to blend together and sound repetitive. I would suggest making this CD an extra, not a priority. If you enjoy the vocals, try the ""Josie and the Pussycats"" soundtrack for more variation."
4,When did Rock Retire?,"It wasn't till I heard this album that I realized that *real* rock music had been missing from my life. This particular release is filled with amazingly complex pop hook's that convert the vocals and music into tight little presents each holding it's own surprise. Yes, it's the same rock feeling with a new rock sound. The band takes a cue from it's title with an unrelenting pace and true musicianship. Showing so much growth and change (since ""AGA"") I would almost tout them as being the best new band of 97'. I believe *real* rock music took a backseat till Foo Fighters and LTC dug it out of its grave, gave it a new face, an amazing texture, & a brilliance only youth could demonstrate. GO! GO! GO!"
5,Exceptionally helpful,"This book arrived the day before I set foot in a local glassblower's studio to take my first class in blowing glass. Right after the first lesson I went home and read the first 40 pages of Beginning Glassblowing. EVERYTHING Schmid said was useful, to the point ,and made the stuff I learned in the studio have a stronger impact. It is an incredibly clear and user friendly book. I learned from the illustrations, and I was able to remember things from the book the next time I stepped into a real studio. This book has been an excellent companion, an inspiration and handy reference. Get a copy if you want to get into hot glass."
2,Underwhelmed,"For the price, I expected more than a half a mile per gallon increase.It will take about five years for this thing to pay for itsself, and I probably wont have my car that long. Maybe it is more effective with other vehicles, or maybe I set the bar too high. (After all, the Tornado is essentially a small piece of twisted metal.) In either case, I dont discourage you from giving this product a shot, I just dont endorse the decision."
2,good only for playing with friends,yeah the cpu is like completley retarded gulie does not counter with his flip kicks ryu doesnt ever do his shukoken uppercuts to counter but some of the characters can be pretty hard like T. Hawk but i just dont get the street fighter arcade - like feeling
1,No Analog Stick Support.,"Since this is a PS1 game there is no code to support the analog stick on a PS2/3 controller. Having to use a D-pad just kills the experience. If you're wanting a collectors piece, buy this, other wise buy Capcom Arcade Classics 1 and 2 to get your hands on the same SFII games, but with analog stick support."
5,A classic of military history,"Not much that can be added to the previous reviews submitted to Amazon.com. This is a classical piece of military history, well written and presented. This would be the best book that you'll find covering the terrible slaughter that is known as 'Verdun' during WWI. The author is one of the best English authors who covers French history and he writes his stories well. Take the time to read this book you wont be disappointed!"
4,Good...,"Fairly quick read, great insight on both the leaders and the soldiers who fought. Brush up on your french though, Some quotes and a few short passages are in french, Without translation. That was my only complaint. If you've gotten as far as to read these reviews then I encourage you to buy the book...you will enjoy it."
5,Respect for French Tenacity,"The story that this book tells is amazing. The writing is wonderful. While the point of view is a bit slanted towards the French, no critiques of French behavior during the battle are softened. Horne manages to do three things very well with this book. He ably describes the battle(s) of Verdun, causes and aftermath, with a goodly number of maps & illustrations. He captures the thoughts & feelings of those taking part in the battle from the lowest poilu in the trenches to the generals. Last, and most important, he paints a picture of the battle in words that allows you to, at least a tiny bit, experience the horrors of fighting over land so fought over that shelling buries the bodies of Germans & French side by side and re-exposes them later. It's worth reading."
5,Very enjoyable and stimulating book.,"This book has it all: well researched facts, highly readable style of writing, and thought provoking comments on the immense waste of life known as Verdun. The reader is able to see first hand the enormous waste of lives caused by the often aloof and childish actions of those few in charge. In reading this book I hope that all will learn the consequences that closemindedness, ignorance, and a failure to adapt can cause. It is sick to see how trivial the human life can be in the hands of those who do not respect it above their own image."
4,A Description of War,"This is a searing account of the battle of Verdun. The relentlessness and remorselessness of battle are illustrated in this book. The battle - meaning the killings, became self-perpetuating. It was only Petain on the French side who was able to ""slow"" this murderous momentum. The Germans introduced phosgene gas to increase the attrition.As the author suggests Verdun may be a reason for the French collapse in 1940. The soldiers were not fighting each other, but were fighting artillery - and were maimed and blown to pieces by it. The Verdun battlefield was small and concentrated and the duration was long. The entire area was constantly being shredded by artillery.The only objection I have is that the author analyzes characters too much by facial features, like Falkenhayn. Also sometimes we are waded down with military positional descriptions - this division on the left flank, that division posted...Nevertheless this is well worth reading."
5,The Price of Glory,"This book was very well written and it is a classic. Sir Alistair has done justice to both sides of the conflict. He has interviewed many of the participants and his research is masterful. My one problem with the book is with all the French idioms. At times I thought he could have provided translations which would have made it easier for the reader especially those who are not fluent in French. He claims this is the costly battle in military history but I think that is open question which others no doubt would disagree. But there is no doubt Verdun 1916 took its toll on men, morale, leaders, and the many years that followed. It always amazes how poor decisions by leaders are forever so costly."
5,Excellent Review of Verdun,"This is the second book I've read by Horne, and I am consistently impressed by his level detail. Horne de-romanticizes this battle, and the war itself by concisely relating the generally miserable day-to-day conditions of the front line soldiers and lower echelon officers. The book is a relatively short read, but nothing is sacrificed. An excellent work!"
4,poetic,"i can not at all agree with the author of the first review! ingrid rubio is perfoming extremely well, just as ricardo darin! the story is poetic, full of emotions and if you don#t get the plot, it might be because you are not sensitive enough! two sisters who lost both of their parents and their brother in a car accident leave home in surch of new luck, new possibilities and trying to forget and overcome their grief. it is a long and not always easy odissey, lots of friendship, love, growing together and growing apart involved. I would not at all see it as a tear jerker, though i have shed tears now and then! it is a much too intelligent, subtile movie with depth, maybe not understandable by everybody. I recommend it! and i love it!"
5,"Biological, Chemical, and Nuclear Warfare - S. Yurkovsky, MD","A nice surprise! This book delivers more than the title promises. Yes, it does contain detailed, concise, and complete instructions that a layperson (or even a physician) could follow to augment his chance of survival in the event of a biological, chemical, or nuclear attack. The instructions list all methods of treatment, conventional and alternative, but lean heavily towards effective homeopathic treatments, both prophyllactic and post exposure.The bonus is a history of homeopathy, the scientific evidence for its validity, and interesting clinical vignettes concerning its use, all referenced. Sage lifestyle, health, and environmental advice is also presented, all thoroughly researched and referenced.The information in this book is a worthwhile addition to anyone's knowledge base. Even experts in the field will likely learn a few new things. Highly recommended!"
2,Not scary. Not erotic. Disappointing.,"This book was the sequel to Pam Keesey's other lesbian vampire anthology, ""Daughters of Darkness"", which was actually a better collection. Both books, however, suffer from too much lesbian politics and not enough raw eroticism. Maybe that's because Pam solicits her stories from the serious ""women's issues"" oriented writers who are fine in their way but can't write erotica worth a damn! VAMPIRES DON'T LOOK FOR CONSENTING PARTNERS TO SHARE THEIR FEELINGS WITH! They're rapacious and evil and prey on the young & beautiful. These stories could easily be creative & imaginative and incredibly hot... but they're NOT, at least not the majority of them. But if you're looking for an ideological study of feminist lesbian thought, then I heartily recommend you purchase this book!"
2,I'm still not sure what this film is about.,"Oh boy. I put this film in the ""Can-I-have-another-hit-off- that-doobie?"" category at Joe's Haus of Weird Film. It aspires to art. It is full of surreal images and inexplicable conversations. It's a Zen movie. You have simply to be, the film has simply to be. All will be revealed if your make of your mind a blank slate. Not.Japanese businessman goes in search of his ancestor and gets caught in the middle of a revolution in Africa. Huh? No, really. That's what it's about. I think. I'm still not certain. Bottom line here is that if you try to take this puppy too seriously, you're doomed. I suggest that you put your critical faculties on hold and watch it as a nice bite of mind candy."
1,Not Worth the Price!,the movie was very slow. not much action and little info was given on the lost ancestor.
5,WOW! is just not enough.,"There are other reviews here that give details about how good this book is. I can only tell you that this book was printed and released at a time when I needed it most. As I read each chapter, I found the information was accurate with my experiences. In a culture that fears death and dying so very much, we are looking for comforting words in books, religious texts and personal lectures ... arenas that can be easily abused or imporperly handled. This book is a keeper. Even if you are not 'into' Shamanism, this book will help you better understand the processes of death and dying."
5,Fantastic,"Ms. Madden is a wonderful writer, combining scientific and shamanic viewpoints and explaining them in terms that are easy to understand. She doesn't write like a superior expert talking down to us, but as another person on the path that wants to share her extraordinary experience to help others.This book showed me that I am not alone in my fears and doubts. It also showed me that much of what I thought was communication from the ""other side"" probably was. I loved reading the stories of Ms. Madden and the other deathwalkers she knows. These were extremely comforting to me.I have used a number of her exercises and found them to be really powerful,especially the ones on connecting with spirit guides and moving through a fear of death. I have struggled with a fear of death for years. With this book, I feel like I am making some very real progress through that."
5,Life Changing,"When the US was attacked and so many lives were lost, I needed to examine my beliefs about death. I refused to think about death at all before this. Then, I found this book and it changed my life.It is intelligently written, using examples and descriptions from several spiritual traditions and quantum physics in addition to first-hand experiences. It answered many of the questions I have carried around for years while offering a great deal more for me to consider. More than that, I feel comforted in my beliefs about an Afterlife now and am more confident in my abilities to help the grieving."
4,Reformat exorsices woes,"With both a Olympus 64MB card and now a SanDisk 128MB card there's no fear of ever running out of media space even when traveling. The 64MB will handle 128 HQ shots (high def.), 665 SQ shots (standard def.) on my Olympus D-490 Zoom (2.1 Megapixel). The SanDisk 128MB Smart Media card twice as many. SHQ (Super-high quality) slows things down a bit.The Olympus card started acting up a week ago: It would only hold 23 standard shots. Two calls to Tech support did not reveal a high degree of service and I learned they do not warrant the card. Fortunately reformating fixed the problem."
2,VERY disappointing...,"First, let me say that I LOVE my Olympus Digital camera (460 D Zoom) and I love my Viking IntelliFlash USB Flash Memory Reader, both of which I bought... They are fantastic products, and for a beginner in the digital photography world, they are simple, yet offer speed and quality you will want to have as you get more and more involved in your hobby. I have bought a 32mb SanDisk Smart Media card, and I love that too. I decided to invest in the 64mb card because I started taking pictures at the higher quality selection on my camera. What I can't figure out is why my camera cannot select the higher quality mode when this memory card is in it. I am REALLY disappointed. Sure, I can take almost 1000 low quality photos with this card; I know that's amazing. But, I specifically bought this card for high quality (actually medium quality since it's only a 1.3 megapixel camera). I just don't understand why this wasn't stipulated in the product description."
1,64mb Smart Media Card,"I have not received my camera as yet, therefore I cannot type a review or opinion regardng same. I will be happy to do so when I receive my camera."
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately on this DVD, Benson seems to have been an addition to the BBC Big band /Orchestra rather than the other way round. The male drummer and 2nd guitarist are the only backing singers and are absolutely useless at it, completely unable to reach the highs most notably in ""Give me the night"" which just sound ridiculous. Bizarrely it looks like someone thought it would be a good idea to have middle aged women dancing in the front, one of whom cringemakingly gets up on stage bumping and grinding while Benson struggles to carry on not knowing what she is going to do next. Benson looks like a fish out of water throughout the whole thing and just plays completely unenthusiastically, looking like he can't wait to finish it. AVOID this, get the Montreux DVD and hope for a new tour and accompanying DVD a LOT better than this one!!"
5,Absolutely FANTASTIC,"George Benson begins his proformance stating ""Ireland remind me of Heaven"". Well, this DVD is Heaven bound! The selection of songs, the Big Band, and his proformance is unbelievable. The video is clear and the sound is great. George performs his great hits with the help of Joe Sample. This DVD is a most have for all George Benson supporters."
3,Not so bad,"Well, I prefer Benson playing the guitar than singing. If we start from this statement I can tell you that for me, the concert was good, just good. The band BEHIND Benson is cold and the don't really play with joy and soul. There are few good moments of playing (the piano section with Joe sample and when Benson makes a bagpipe sound with the guitar) but all is ruined when a group of middle-age women start to do some dirty dancing... come on!!! one of them climbed up to dance with an uncomfortable George (just look at his face when she tries to do a sexual dance with him). She even tries to catch the mic from George's hand. This can't happen in a professional performance. No way.Concert includes: All of me, I only have eyes for you, Beyond the sea, Deeper than you think, Hipping the hop, Lately, The ghetto, In your eyes, Moody's mood, Danny boy, The masquerade, Breezin', Love x love, Turn your love around, Never give up on a good thing, Give me that night, On Broadway."
5,Marvelous,"This is wonderful way to stay home and being entertained. Everything is so clear. And the music is awesome indeed!Sincerely yours,Frances Priester"
4,"Some cheese, but he's still great..","The big band stuff could've been left out, although the BBC big band is pretty decent and the arrangements are great. The songs with only his band and Joe Sample are what most fans are probably going to like. The DVD includes a bit on how the film was made, some interview segments, a bio and photo gallery. The interview segments are really corny. But for any real fan this is a must own, especially with the lack of video material available for Benson fans."
1,Tres pauvre,"pas d'ambiance et aucun intéret pour un DVD (avec des images...), autant acheter un bon CD !"
4,Hydor THEO Submersible Aquarium Heater 50W UL (,"It is a good heater. I think the temp might be a little off. i have it at the highest setting and the thermometer says 77 degrees, but it is in a very cool room"
5,"Nice compact size, accurate, stable","I ordered this heater because the one I already had was a little too bulky for my 5gal tank. It has been running for several weeks now and the only problem I've had is it runs about 3 degrees F above the setting but it is very consistent with the temp. I like how small this heater is without sacrificing wattage, I like the dial on top that has actual degree settings, I also like that there is an on/off light. I would recommend this heater."
3,Okay,"I bought two heaters one 50 watt the other is 25 watt, the 25 watt is going strong but the 50 has had a peculiar issue. I had put this heater in the tank and crank it to 85*F due to a previous Ich infestation. Well a few days ago I turned it down to 79 and guess what? It is still maintaining a constant 84-85*F range. I have two thermometers in the tank (1 digital & 1 physical) so I know this isn't an error. I am currently waiting for a response of Hydor and will update my comment eventually, other then this it isn't a bad heater."
1,"Heat, what heat?",It is 75 degrees in my house. I have this thing cranked and it is keeping my ten gallon tank at 78 degrees. I'm not impressed at all.
5,Great!,"Recently rescued a Red Eared Slider and needed to set up an environment from scratch. In an effort to make this venture as affordable as possible, I did a lot of research before purchasing any products. This heater is an awesome price on Amazon and compared to other models at $30 and up, it performs just as well. I was starting to really worry about my turtle because for two weeks she was without a heater. Since the arrival of this item, she has been comfortable and healthy. My set up is complete!"
3,I expected more.,"I thought Theo was suppose to be a good aquarium heater. The reason I disagree with the reviews I read in the past is that the heater is unable to keep my aquarium at the temperature I'd like. No matter how low I set the dial, it still keeps my tank at 90 degrees.The overall form factor of it is quite nice. Easy to operate and set up. Because of those things, its not a total loss. I just wish it would turn off when the desired temperature has been reached.And for those out there who are wanting to ask: I have a 10 gallon tank (even though that doesn't matter. I should be able to get a 200 watt heater and have it work since it should just shut itself off when it gets to temperature). I have tried unplugging it and plugging it in, but that doesn't work. And it hasn't been taken out of the tank without first being turned off (even though it is able to cope with this)."
4,An Ink Spots Collector's Dream,"The 25 tracks presented are unquestionably an exciting find- radio transcriptions and movie soundtrack recordings, primarily by the famed quartet. While the sound quality on several cuts is less than stellar, the rarity and quality of the performances more than make up for it. The last 16 songs, taken from the Armed Forces Victory Parade of Spotlight Bands broadcasts, are notably entertaining, with Bernie Mackey replacing Charlie Fuqua on guitar. A number of dubs from the Pardon My Sarong film round out the disc. The most intriguing recording is a version of ""The Lamplighter's Serenade"", which was apparently taped at a private residence from a radio broadcast in 1943. The liner notes tell the listeners exactly what they're getting and in great detail. While ""Rare Air"" isn't a substitute for an Ink Spots ""hits"" package, group harmony collectors will certainly be entertained and pleased."
4,Comfortable,"A friend recommended these Volatile flipflops. I bought two pairs, and they are the most comfortable sandals I own. They are great for walking at the zoo, at the mall, and any other place where you are not walking at a steady pace. My feet were not tired at all after walking four hours at the zoo. I strongly recommend."
5,very comfortable,Ordered these shoes without trying them on in a store. I just went off of a few friends talking highly about them. I must say I am very pleased with them. They are very comfortable and seem to be good quality. I ordered them for vacation and did a lot of walking in them. I am very pleased with the way they wear!! I will order them again when these wear out!
5,Comfort,"I love my shoes, they are so comfortable! awesome product,recommended by my best friend. Thanks! and what a great price."
3,Brown Sandals,These are okay nothing really special about them. Comfortable foot bed but kinda pain jane. The straps kinda rub my feet wrong so if I walk too long (several hours) I sometimes get blisters.
3,Not A Wheel of time Clone But worth a read,The one and only reason I bought this book was because it was written by Robert Jorden.I have been a long time fan of the Wheel of time series and was hoping for something similar when i bought Conan But was quite plesantly surprised by someThing quite markedly Different.Firstly the book is far more pacier and more action packed than the WOT series.What really this book lacks is that it siply does not make you long to read the next book.It is hard not to compare this book to Jordans previous works as wellas the movie that was released of the same nam .All considered its a good book for the price you pay but don't expect a WOT clone
3,Beats plastic,This flatware was nice. At the price this flatware is being sold I did expect them to be a little more solid like the Oneida flatware we have purchased for our home. All in all decent purchase a little over priced.
5,Montessori at Home,I just love this set. I feel each piece is the perfect size!I love the metal feeding spoon. It is just right for baby's mouth and can be used effectively to scoop up mush from the chin.If you are providing a Montessori environment at home the toddler fork and spoon are perfect for little hands.The larger 'junior' set will be about right for a 3-4 year old.
4,Glad I bought this set,"Happy with this utensil set for my 20 mo old. Arrived packaged nicely, my child can use the set easily, washes well- no complaints."
2,a lack of cohesion makes for a sloppy compilation.,"As someone thoroughly interested in Gregory of Nyssa and his promotion of Paul's idea of apokatastasis, I was disappointed to read that Danielou seems to be the only Nyssa scholar (living or not) that believes that Nyssa was not a proponent of universal salvation (read: restoration.) His exclusion of Nyssa's sections from The Life of Moses that support apokatastasis was especially disappointing.Altogether, though, I felt that the compilation was simply not a coherent stream of thought. Jumping from Imago Dei to the Song of Solomon was too much for me...I like my compilations to make a little more sense as I'm reading them--or at least have transitions from topic to topic that make the entirety of the reading a little more cohesive."
5,Item arrived broken but quick refund,"Unfortunately these arrived broken, but I mailed back and received my refund within a week. The set itself looks great!"
4,best marvel capcom made,i've played all the capcom maevel games and this is the best the hulk is actually green .not pink or grey but green like he is suposed to be.the rounds go fast
3,Very nice feature for your money,I bought this camera to compliment my 46 in. Samsung Full HD LCD TV. The picture was very nice although the 30 mins. limitation of the DVD writeable media and the need to finalize the disk was a setback. I donot have the Blue Ray player yet so I connected my LCD TV using DVI to HDMI cable to my HTPC Windows Vista running on Dual core AMD 64 and an HD video card to view the HD picture taken from this camera and I am really pleased.
3,Be Sure You Know What You are Getting Nto,"I purchase the HDC-DX1 about a month ago and have been very happy with the picture quality, the picture enhancement features, etc. I was disappointed to find out after my purchase that I needed special software to download the content to, and edit it on, my computer and probably need a Blue Ray DVD burner to be able to create edited disks. I haven't worked with the software yet, so be sure you understand the implications of buying a camera with a format that is not the standard format used by most digital cameras."
4,Wish it had a hard drive,"Love the camera, but with only 17 mins of high definition available on a dvdram disk, I wish it came with a hard drive, but excellent camera for the price."
4,nero 7 reloaded or nero 8,"convert avchd to mpeg-2 using nero 7 reloaded or nero8if u want to edit with original format AVCHD ,then use Ulead 11 Plus with AVCHD patch download"
1,Stay away!!!,I got one a couple of years ago for pro use. 3 times the mini dvd was unformatable and I could not properly transfer my footage. I now need to get something more reliable and regret wasting my money on this. I used verbatim dvds (good quality) and about 10% could not even be recognized.
1,cheap metal,"i bought 6 can openers 3 have already wore out. i have 1 i got from my father who is in the military, it's lasted for years."
3,Its just Okay,"Blade seems a little too dull, and it never opened correctly but now i have lost it so i can't exchange it"
1,Not great,"Upon the first use, the metal was sheared off where it grabs the can lip. No longer useful at all. Be very carful that you don't turn the opener and shear this part."
1,GI-P_38 Can opener,"No opinion.......I never got it. I paid for it, but it never came in the mail with the other items I ordered."
3,"Not too bad, not great.","This was a decent effort to put the Nibelungenlied to film. The FX was good, the sets and costumes were above average and most of the actors were ok. However, it really didn't do much for me, and had too much of a TV-movie feel to it. I'd rather listen to Wagner."
1,Junk,"I watched the original version of this movie in Germany, It is based on the Ancient German legen of Siegfried.. This is inaccurate to actual story is sooo americanized... Dont buy it and read the original story Nibelungen or the legend of Siegfried.."
3,Awesome TV series but...,"I watched this on Sci-fi everytime it was on. I could probably recite the entire movie to you, but I am ver dissapointed in the DVD because it is missing a lot that was shown in the series on tv. I would not recommend purchasing this DVD,b but if you get the chance, tape it if it ever comes back to Sci-fi"
2,Sigurd the Volsong It's Not,"This made for television video, loosely based on the Norse legend ""Sigurd the Volsong,"" is not strong on acting or on following the legend, but it provides about one hundred minutes of sword fights and magic that can be found in the legend. The dragon Fafnir isn't fully explained, but at least he/it is in the movie. I don't understand why the writers changed the protagonist's name or his family background, and having Brunhild as the queen of Iceland was really a stretch, but if you don't know the Norse myth, it is a pretty good watch."
1,what a waste,"as a german, I apologize for this terrible adaption of the siegfried legend. ;-)i am glad many of you liked it - maybe in english it is just not so hard to endure. but in the german version, i can just stand up and applaud when siegfried finally gets killed. he is so ridiculous!!! ""hey! nich wein'n - hey! don't cry!""there would have been so many better actors to impersonate siegfried. as long as its not till schweiger, everybody is better than benno fürmann. sorry! ;-)"
3,Just Not Much There,"I was really looking forward to this movie, it has Kristina Loken and Alicia Witt who are 2 actresses I like. Unfortunately this was typical Sci-Fi Channel product, week story and not much to keep my interest up. I did make it to the end of the movie but from about 45 minutes into it I was saying ""just kill everybody and get it over with""...... It may be worth renting but definately one watching was more than enough. If you're looking for a dragon movie, there is one scene with the dragon, he's kool, but only for about 5 minutes"
2,Eh,"This movie was adequate.What I would have to say about this movie overall is that some parts of it had potential.The movie had great scenery and attention to costume design. Some of the acting was superb (brunhild), while others I hated (Sigfried! What kind of accent was that? I just hated his character as well).Also, I think the character brunhild was superb. I loved her character design and personality very much, and it's a shame that she was paired with such a weak character like sigfried. They should have had the movie based on her instead.Sigfried was not how you would picture a hero at all. He wasn't even an anti-hero. All he cared about was himself and the only quality that in my mind made him a hero was his ""courage"" and ""strength.""This movie starts out very badly and kinda unrealistically, but it gets more interesting towards the latter half (aka: when brunhild comes in) and ends on an unexpected and sorta unsatisfactory ending."
1,A complete waste of time,"I finally watched this borefest that I'd recorded from the Scifi channel last spring. Too bad that I didn't accidentally erase it. After four hours watching the ""full version,"" I gained nothing and cared less about the characters and who did what to whom. The only pluses to it were the attention to detail in costumes, props, etc. and the acting which was credible. The story was preposterous even for a myth.I cannot believe that anyone over the age of 12 enjoyed this or even consider it worthy of purchase on DVD."
2,If you think this is different from what you saw on the Science Fiction Channel,"...You're right. Many scenes were cut out completely and others were shortened. What remains is a poor tribute to the efforts of a strong cast. Many of the humerous, short scenes which helped humanize the main character were cut as was much of Max Von Sydow's screen time.The heavy handedness of the re-editing is as bad or worse than what one sees when a broadcast network puts on an R rated feature film, but less predictable. Believe me, save your money and wait for a chace to record a rerun of the original from TV."
2,Boo! Why did they cut it?,"What was the point in cutting 50 minutes from what was otherwise a powerful and enchanting film? We ordered the DVD because we saw the full version on the Sci Fi Channel and loved it. The edited version is still a decent film, but we found it impossible to enjoy as much as we enjoyed the original because of the numerous gaping holes in the story.If, like us, you wanted to buy this film because you saw it on Sci Fi, WAIT! Until they release the complete, original version."
3,Disappointed,"I purchased this version of Dark Kingdom: The Dragon King believing that it was the original version which was recently shown on the Sci-Fi channel. Nothing on the DVD box indicated that this was anything but the original version. I was bitterly disappointed to find that numerous scenes were cut from the original version. While all of the major scenes in the film are included, the deleted scenes gave the film much of its heart and soul by providing more of an emotional background for each of the characters. If you are a fantasy film fan you will still enjoy the DVD version but for those who saw the original you are left wondering why the film was cut apart. The original gets 5 stars, the DVD gets 3."
1,I hope there's a Director's Cut or Extended Version,"I was so disappointed with this DVD. I saw the full movie on the SciFi Channel, and when I found out it was coming on DVD, I couldn't wait to buy it. After I played it, I felt cheated. So many scenes are cut, some of which were important to the story. Also, the captions for the foreign languages was missing on the DVD. Like I said, I hope they come up with a Director's Cut or Extended Version. Until then, I'll just watch the full version I recorded on my VCR."
4,"Siegfried, Fafnir and Brynhild!","I teach Ancient Literature to college prep 10th graders. The class is taught on a four year undergrad level. We read GILGAMESH, THE RAMAYANA, Hamilton's MYTHOLOGY, THE ILIAD, THE ODYSSEY and units on Egyptian and Germanic myths. Hamilton covers the Siegfried story in her book, but she does a terrible job of it. I've found some other sources, but as wonderful as the tale is, it can be confusing. This film is an excellent aid when teaching the Siegfried story. It is true to the tale to a great degree (it outclasses TROY and BEOWULF in this sense big time) and my students thoroughly enjoy it. It's fun and despite being a ""TV Movie"" it doesn't look cheesy. I only gave it four stars because it's set in the 5th century but Gunter lives in a stone castle. Also, Siegfried and Kreimhild are wedded by a Catholic priest. What is that about? The Niebelungenlied is about as far from Christianity as you can get. Let the Old Gods have their due! But, all in all I say BUY IT!"
1,"Great movie - But buy Sword of Xanten UK version, not this one!","This is a great movie but it is cut. The full version at 177 min is not available for NTSC format players yet. Go over to Amazon.co.uk and pick up ""Sword of Xanten"" for $10. You'll get all 177 min of footage plus some bonus material on 2 DVDs. Yes PAL format won't work on American DVD players but if you know what to do this won't be a problem."
2,Dark Kingdom:The Dragon King,"Amazon misrepresented this item in its advertisement. On their web page they presented this item as being 184 minutes long. This would have been the original mini series which i wanted. When I received the item, it is only 132 minutes long. I already had this dvd. I wanted the 184 minutes version. There is no place on their web page to complain about it."
4,Good,I bought the movie for my son. He's always been into movies like this and I know that he has been wanting to have this one cause he has all the other ones. So I got it for his birthday and he just loves it. Thank you so much for making it possible to get.
4,Brazilian rock and new wave collection,"A best-of set from Brazilian rock singer Baby Consuelo (aka Baby Brazil), formerly from the psychedelic tropicalia band, Novos Baianos. These are later songs of hers, from the 1980s, including tracks that dip into the then-popular ""new wave"" and ""BRock"" styles of the '80s. (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue Brazilian Music Guide)"
4,Feels Nice,"Bought the powerpack and I was very impressed after installation. it was the only system besides Win2k to recognize my CD-RW correctly an both of my Ethernet adapters. It feels very stable and rocksolid, doesnt have that patched together feel that some *nix Operating Environments have. The installation was the same as in 4.0 but seemed a litte quicker the way it done things. Setting it up was very easy to do and getting it running was a no-brainer. I am impressed with the package management features it has in the /stand/sysinstall program. Another great aspect of not just FreeBSD but other BSD's is the ports collection. it contains all kinds of different software to make your system that much better Overall I gave it 4 stars because there is room for improvement. But keep up the great work!"
4,excellent,"First in a two volume set, Barry 7s Connectors is library, or, program music: public domain material used on films and television in the 1960s and 1970s.As a genre, a lot of this is lounge, or outright elevator. But Barry 7 concentrates on more electronic and funky material. This is great material, and if you're a DJ, this would be essential for sources,You can never have enough program music, and there are infinite amounts on CD. Start with Barry's two. For more orchestrated lounge fun, start withThe Sound Gallery, Vol. 1, then move onto two."
4,"Mellow, Eclectic","Barry 7's Connectors is a selection of eclectic soundtrack music from the 1960's & 70s. Plenty of drippy strings, echoey synths, moody horns, wah guitar and funky bass n' drums. You never know what you're going to hear next.For adventurous listeners only.Download at roughtradedigital.[DW]"
4,Memories,I remember when this was first released. I rented it but didn't understand it. Now I completely know what it's all about. great memories
4,Capcom makes a Mega Man that works!,"Mega Man Legends is a great game. Its long, it has good audio,and it's fun. Witch to me is the most important part of a game. It's only bad points are the graphics(it's 3d inviorments,but 2d figures.)Another bad thing is the controls witch take a while to get used to. Except for that,the game is a keeper and I highly recomend it."
2,Games not that great,i dont think this game is great its okay for a regular game but it doesnt meet the expectations you would think mega man deserved. The graphics arent amazing but okay as far as the 3d goes but the textures are terible. The game play isnt that bad its just not worth the money. This game is almost as good as the regular megaman series but its not as good as the mega man x series. this game is good for ages 7 - 12 but if your a teenager or adult get one of the mega man x games.
2,A kid from virginia says,"The game is okay at the beginning, but as it progressess it gets more and more boring and you get lost in the ruins. The bosses are kind of cheesy themselves. Plus the graffics aren't that great. But then again its just my opinion."
4,Mega Man Legends,"I never liked mega man games. This one changed my mind. It is incredibly interactive provides lots of stuff to do and awesome power ups. I get kick out of just walking around in the city areas in the game. In a few words kick *** story, game, powerups etc. The game is worth every last penny. It's great for newbies and experts."
4,Quick and to the point,"I got it on the specified ship date, while the game was severely scratched, more so than I would've assumed was implied in the description, it does in fact work as promised, great, honest seller, would recommend."
4,Legends is loads of fun,Mega Man Legends is a great new series for mega man. The story takes him to an island searching for energy crystals on his dig adventures. Game play is fun and easy to learn. The game has plenty of secret goodies for you too discovery adding hours of replay value. easy and fun to play but not easy enough that you'll only spend oh...one week or so one it. Loads of fun a most have for hardcore mega man and new mega man fans of all ages!!!
3,It's okay but its not all that,"This is an okay game. You play as a boy named Mega Man who was found by an old man(forgot his real name, just call him gramps). But their ship starts falling onto an island named Katalox!That's when Gramps runs into the engine and try to fix the ship. But it is no use. On the island named Katalox Mega Man runs down a trail, but before he does a police car comes. Run back to the ship wreck and talk to the sheriff. He says later, One of you will have to come with us. Gramps answers, he will. Follow the trail which leads you to Apple Market. Sneak up in somebodys conversation and you will get a pass to a door you couldn't get to before. Inside that door is a city. A cut scene will appear. The city is divided into 5 pieces. Apple Market, Downtown, Uptown, City Hall, and Old City. In the Old City watch out for dogs... as they will attack you. Now I'm not going to tell anymore.You'll have to find the rest out by BUYING the game. That should have encouraged you."
5,Top flight Sunshine Pop,This is one of the finest examples of late 60's sunshine pop. The vocals are excellent. Two questions. Why wasn't this a hit and why did these guys quit recording? This group easily could've been top 40 stars. Every cut on this CD works. I was surprised by the quality and the vibrancy of this CD. A shame they didn't go on.
3,The title doesn't match the contents,"This book concerns online trading of splits, not stocks online trading in general, as you might expect from the title. If you look for a book about split trading, this one is all right. If you start stocks online trading, consider searching for another title."
5,Trade Stocks Online,Mark Larson's book provides real insights into how to make REAL money when the stock market goes up OR down. You often wonder whether the author following the principles outlined would make money. This author is living proof that the principles outlined in the book do make money. It is a complement to the author's other educational endeavors. This book is highly recommended. Thanks Mark.
4,Thanks for your help,"I can finally see the ""picture"" on the charts and I am doing much better with my trading."
1,Another waste of time from a complete idiot,"See my review of his other waste of time for more detail. I have met his guy and know that he is just a terrible trader. Everyone made (and lost) in the late nineties into 2000. The key to successful trading is having a set of methods that can work in any market, or at least keep your losses limited during tough times. This book niether provides any insight into profitable strategies that work today or lessons on how to keep losses to a minimum (in fact I KNOW that his guys averages his losing trades...losers average losers, mark). Avoid this waste of your time. Spend toime reading the educational resources on your own brokers website instead. Its free."
3,Passable product,"The coconut pocky simply didn't hold up to the potential of the true deliciousness of the combination of chocolate and coconut on an edible stick, especially when you consider the price you pay for this product. These Asian sweets are, regrettably, forgettable, except for the price tag. The sticks themselves were too small and the coating of chocolate and coconut was far too thin. The sticks should have been somewhat more substantial and flavorful (perhaps with vanilla or with coconut baked into the stick) and dipped multiple times, alternating between layers of chocolate and coconut.These are not actually bad, but could be much, much better and are disappointing for the price."
3,"Not bad, probably wont get much play....","As one of the other reviewers noted, this is pleasant enough but their are NO standout tracks.Guess we're just spoiled from this artists fantastic,God-like 60's thru mid-70's magical output! Seriously, during that time Ben could do no wrong, each release a timeless classic. This release reminded me of what David Byrnes stuff usually sounds like, his take on ""world music"" (though I admit im no Byrne expert!). Kinda boring, actually...My advice is search out one of Ben's masterpieces from the aforementioned time period, if you're new to his work. You wont be sorry!!!"
4,It's ok,Pretty much the usual fare for this type of product. Beginners would like to see the diagrammed chord over each and every change because they are still trying to remember the configurations. I am o.k. with this product.
1,Total Crap,The just got this book for my 11 year old son. I was excited to recieve the book because all the previous reviews were so great. Don't be fooled this book is a piece of junk. After 15 minutes of playing the songs in the book it was appearant that none of the songs sound anything like the originals. I took the book to his guitar instructor and she tried playing the songs and completely agreed that the book stinks. My only guess would be that the previous reviews had to be written by the composers friends. Save your money.
2,DISSAPPOINTING,I ordered this product thinking that it was going to be a quality item. The pages appear to be a copy of a copy that was copied on a home copy machine and then stapled together by hand.This product does not correspond with the cost. I could have checked this book out a book from the library and made a better product!
2,Are the songs in the same key as the original music?,"No one has mentioned yet if this book's music can be played along with the song.that would be the primary reason for me to buy this, to play along with the Eagles. Anyone know if its playable with the original music?"
3,Too small for Kindle on computer,"I was excited to get this, but when I openned it up on my PC Kindle app I was disappointed by how difficult it was to see. I was able to strum some and read the words but I think that for music I'd prefer to use hard copy so I can photocopy it and have all the pages more available. It was a bit of a pain to be strumming along and have to stop to use the mouse to click to the next page. It also lacks any advice for a strumming pattern, those of us who are beginners would appreciate a little more guidance. Not unusable, but I'd prefer to have the book itself and will probably end up just spending the money on the book."
1,Misleading description of the product!,"I received the product today and while it's the right product, the color is wrong. It's supposed to be bone white, which anyone knows is a browninsh/yellow white. This register is grey. I even took it into my master bath that uses dove grey and it was perfect in there. You need to change the color of to grey instead of bone white."
4,They do the job,"These are nice, but I am having a couple of problems with the sliding piece coming off and falling into the floor vent however. Also, be aware that the top profile of the vent is curved, so if you are placing this in a spot where people walk they are likely to trip over it. As for the sliding pieces falling off of them, well, I finally just decided to take them off and let the air blow full force from the vents. So they do the job, and they don't rust like the metal ones. And they are very sturdy. I've stepped on them numerous times and not so much as a hint that they will crack or break. Overall, I'm happy with them. They do the job."
4,Interesting read,"To say that Canned Heat is a band that has had their ups and downs would be putting it mildly. Fito de la Parra, long time drummer for the group, has been there during the band's high points and low points and everything in between. His chronicle of Canned Heat's history proves the old adage that truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. Some readers may find parts of this book repugnant ( like Fito's ex-wife ) but it's never boring."
3,An entertaining sci-fi thriller.,"Rob Estes plays a cop who is unknowingly the real Nostradamus, and ends up having to save the world from Armageddon. The plotline of Nostradamus is slim but believable for the most part and the movie is both funny and thought-provoking. The swift movement of the action to the climax and conclusion also helps to make this a drama worth watching, providing an interesting twist to the Nostradamus legend. For all fans of Rob Estes from his ""Silk"" days, he is still as good as ever!"
1,Why is it called Nostradamus?,"I've seen this movie on the Sci-Fi channel, I stopped to see it because I was interested in Nostradamus. However, it has apparently nothing to do with him, except on some scenes. This movie is confusing a terribly compiled. It doesn't give any type of information whatsoever about this great prophet. It's not worth buying...not at all."
5,Awesome movie,"I saw this movie on tv and later purchased it. I watch it over and over. I recommend it if you like time travel, mysteries and fast moving plots."
1,This movie SUCKS!,"This is the worst movie ever made. It has the worst script, actors, and every other bad movie element. It is total CRAP!"
2,Throughly dissapointed!,"Planet Asia has been highly touted as one of the best up and coming MCs with the work he did with Rasco on the Cali Agents LP, his solo shots on the ABB Records complilation, and his EP, The Last Stand. When word got out the he was signed to Interscope Records,(home of west coast comrads Jurassic 5), the buzz grew even bigger. On this LP, he must have lost plenty of motivation as well as patience because his work on the album is sub par. The tracks are unimaginative, the beats generic and repetitive, and overall the album seems more like a demo tape than something you would want people to hear. Planet Asia has too much talent to release a CD this unlistenable. Buyers beware, don't get this album!"
5,A funny and touching autobiography,"It's amazing how nasty, insightful and funny are Callahan's cartoons. In this book he relates the incidents that turned him into an alcoholic quadriplegic -and into one of the least PC humorists alive.The book is very honest. Callahan don't put the blame of his miseries on external factors (unless when it comes to burocracy, and how the system penalize those who try make a living by working). He takes full responsibility of his mistakes and actions.The book is extremely well written and easy to read. Callahan presents us his childhood, his drinking days and his insecurities in love as a teenager, the stupid accident, how he had to learn to live as quadriplegic, even more drinking years, his decision to take control of his life, the experience at AA, the search for his real mother, the ideas behind his cartoons and the reactions received, the frustration with welfare, and -of course- several of his cartoons.Highly recommended."
4,a date to remember,"back in 84 i had the pleasure of seeing the smiths perform live. the perfomance featured many of the songs off this their debut album. and although they later produced the superior the queen is dead. this record remains firmly lodged in my memory. this was the first time that i had really ever been touched by music, the album invoked a kind of passion in me that only a handfull of records over thirty years have managed to do. so i would like to thank morrisey and marr for this, one of the most important albums of the last twenty years."
3,Second-weakest Smiths record,"It's clear that the band was not yet musically mature. Morrissey's vocals are weaker than on classics like the Queen is Dead and Louder than Bombs. The songs are musically more spare and not as strong.This one is for big Smiths fans. The rest of us should stick with Queen is Dead, Strangeways, and Louder than Bombs."
2,Disappointing,"Aside from a few good numbers (""This Charming Man,"" ""Hand in Glove,"" ""Reel Around the Fountain""), this is a fairly disappointing album. There are too many moments where nothing is happening musically and other moments where the lyrics are too heavy-handed.. The pretentious ""Suffer Little Children"" is an example of the group's attempt at covering a serious subject, but the song goes on far too long, wearing the listener down."
4,Solid if disappointing debut album,"This debut album from The Smiths, while excellent, is nowhere near the quality of their later albums. This has nothing to do with the songwriting and everything to do with the production. The album had already been recorded once using producer Troy Tate (and if you can find a copy of the bootleg Troy Tate Album, you'll be surprised at how much better it is than this). The arrangements and production on this album were altered to the point of sanitizing the music a bit too much. That being said, the songs are top-notch, especially Pretty Girls Make Graves, Suffer Little Children, Still Ill, What Difference Does it Make, Hand in Glove, etc. While I wouldn't recommend this as your first Smiths CD to buy, it's definitely a great album and essential to your Smiths collection."
3,Bre's,"Don't get me wrong, I am fond of a Lori Wick novel. I am also fond of a good romance. As a romance, this book was good, but as a piece of Christian literature, it fails to hit the vital spot. I don't know how other readers feel, but I believe that a Christian novel needs to more than good, pure, upstanding, non-offensive literature, but also deeply challenging, focusing on the issues that effect so many lives. The book itself is good. It is well written, but I found Stacy to be almost boringly similar to many of Lori's other female characters. Ditto for the husband and wife relationship. I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy this book. I did, very much. I'm sure a lot of people will think I'm too critical, but I can't change my opinion, I'm afraid. However, if you enjoy Lori Wick, I'm sure you'll enjoy this one too."
5,I love the history it showed,This video is so real & shows how evil men & women can to his brothers & sisters on the earth.
4,Great old school game,Bought this for my husband and he loves it. Its an old school game but its timeless. He says its one of the best one ever made. A classic
2,Good songwriter,"but an over-rated average guitarist. I just saw him be completely overshadowed, blown away, on the same stage with the Great Mato Nanji of Indigenous on the BB King Tour. It really brought it home how Kenny's playing is pre-thought out, he doesnt take chances, never ""takes off"" while Nanji is a rocket-powered roller coaster ride. I like his songs, but they should down-play the ""guitar great"" angle - and it's too bad he can't sing - the singer in his band has an annoying stage presence. Kenny prances around too much too. Makes me like this record less (before concert I would have given it three stars)"
2,This is Blues? SRV is rolling over in his grave,"What a disappointment. After your first album, I thought I had discovered another in the many up and coming young white blues guitarists. I don't know whose idea it was, Kenny's or the record company's, to turn him into a rock star instead, but it was a bad idea. What we really don't need is another loud screaming rocker. Let's hope he sees what a mistake this album was"
2,"Shepherd is a good guitarist, but too derivative","Shepherd knows his instrument well, but he's not the best blues guitarist out there. The Stevie Ray Vaughan influence is so strong sometimes it feels as if I'm hearing SRV himself, albeit a more tepid version. Heck, if I want to hear Vaughan, I'll go out buy his CDs why should I care for any wannabes? That said, this can copy Vaughan to a scary degree. Still if you want to a real modern blues virtuoso, I'd suggest you check out this Chicago virtuoso called Melvin Taylor. That guy is something else altogether. Trust me, I couldn't believe anyone could play like that when I first heard him."
4,good cd,THIS WAS THE DEBUT OF NEW SINGER NOAH HUNT WITH THE BAND.THIS IS A VERY GOOD CD.GREAT GUITAR WORK BY KENNY AND NOW THEY HAVE A GOOD SINGER TO.GREAT SONG BLUE ON BLACK GOT ALL THE RAdIO PLAY BUT THE WHOLE CD IS GOOD.LOVE THE INSTRUMENTAL TROUBLE IS.GOOD PLACE TO START FOR NEW KENNY WAYNE FANS.
3,Didn't live up to Led Better,Lead singer Noah Hunt is no match for Cory Sterling. When you have something great why change to something good.
4,A true talent! Unbelievable!!,It is so great to hear a talent like this is rising through the scene. He is so young and so talented! Love the sound. If you get a chance to see him live don't walk....RUN!!! I saw SRV twice and this guy's fingers burn on that guitar. Keep up the great work Kenny Wayne. We need your music!!
5,An instant favorite,"I still haven't heard ""Live On"" but KWS band is quickly becoming one of my favorites. I bought this album only about a week ago and I love it. Just like ""Ledbetter Heights"" there isn't one bad track on the album. My overall favorite track is ""Blue On Black"", its perfect, its catchy, has great lyrics and an amazing guitar solo. Some of my other favs are ""Slow Ride"" and the cover of ""I Don't Live Today"". I really like every song, no skipping over songs with this album. Kennys guitar playing is amazing, but besides that I can't exactly say what makes this album so good, just everything about it works. The new singer, Noah Hunt has a great voice that works really well w/ this music (Cory Sterling was really good too, but Noah Hunt's better for this album). If you like good music, any kind of music, I suggest this album."
3,"For now, get in line with the rest of the heap.","Just like Jonny Lang, I would like to see ""KWS"" move out of the heap and get into something interesting. How white guys with Strats ARE there? I wonder if that's all it takes to get a record deal these days. No, just kidding. Seriously, ""Blue On Black"" had a good video and the song's good. I have the same complaint with KWSB that I do with Jonny Lang-too much brand-spanking new studio sheen and not enough textural or stylistic variety. Again, like Lang, the technical know-how is solid, they just need to utilize it in a more daring way and use that fretboard wizardry to REALLY KICK SOME ASS!"
4,"very good cd , evolving into a blues master","I first heard of Kenny Wayne Shepard when his debut album came out. I was very impressed with his guitar work. His guitar expressions could almost pass for Stevie Ray Vaughn. However, I don't think he can touch SRV. You could see his potential. I immediately bought his second cd. I was even more impressed! He sounds much more polished and has found his own mark in the blues scene. He will certainly become a blues great. Songs like ""Blue on Black"" ""Slow Ride""""Nothing to do with Love"" in fact, most of the songs he is willing to come out and establish a style he can call his own. Sure, you can still hear some SRV riffs but the KWSB is coming into their own. I can't wait for his third cd. He's definately a gifted person. Hope he comes to Hawaii!!!"
4,A great blues-rock album,"I love this album. I didn't give it 5 stars only because I know once the band grows, it'll be even better. And, besides, I only reserve 5 stars to the greatest bands (Dave Matthews Band, Radiohead). But undoubtably KWSB will get there someday! The songs aren't just catchy, but well done. Noah's voice is great, and Kenny's guitar rocks, as does the rest of the band. Yes, BAND. It's not just Kenny!:-) If you like blues-rock, go for it. If you don't ... go for it! It's a great album for anyone to have. I promise."
3,It really isnt that good...,"I mean come on. Yeah, so he's 20 or however old he is. So what? He's alright. Just stop comparing him to Stevie, or Jimi, or anybody really good. It's really beginning to peeve me. He's just not there yet. I figure him maybe Jonny Lang caliber. Maybe in another 15 years both Kenny & Jonny will be listenable. Blue on black is the only song I can listen to. And it's on the radio, so you know that's not a good sign...anyhow buy the CD if you like the stuff. I'd just as soon skip it and buy Stevie's Texas Flood or B.B.'s Lucille Talks back. Happy listening!"
4,"Hey, who's that...Stevie? Hendrix? Nope, THIS DUDE'S ALIVE",Extremely good electric blues in the vein of STV and Hendrix. This whole CD is excellent -- I'll be buying more from Kenny Wayne Shepherd.
5,Kenny Wayne Shepherd,"This man was definately sitting in the front of the music class. I plan on obtaining more of his cd's. For all that appreciate ""Blues Rock Style"" this is a must have."
4,Trouble Is,"I bought this when it was first released, It's still kept in my rotation. No, it ain't his best album, but it has its moments. If you're a fan, you'll like it. He was still very young when this was recorded, but talent is ageless. It's a solid performance that's sure to please."
4,Old Blues with a new twist,"I knew what I was getting when I bought this cd, but man, it still blew me away. I loved the fact that I could actually tell the influences of BB King, Muddy Waters, and more as I listened to Kenny Wayne Shepherd belt out the blues. An excellent product."
4,AMAZING!!!!,"This cd is awsome! It's hard to believe that this dude, who can't legally drink yet, can play the way he does! I went to an Aerosmith concert 3 months ago and Shepherd was the opening band I liked him almost better than Aerosmith! One of the songs he performed was Jimi Hendrix's ""VOODOO CHILD ""and did an AWSOME job! No wonder they call him the next Jimi/SRV!!!"
5,Loved it!,"This is one of the best recordings I have heard in a while. It's incredibly satisfying, both for the repertoire and for Grabois' and Nauman's playing of it (especially if you like romantic music as much as I do). Expressive and passionate playing of beautiful music doesn't get better than this!"
5,classical musician,"This CD is fabulous start to finish. The players have a stunning sense of style and pacing for all three pieces. They play with color, flow, and a nice feeling of time and space in the music. The playing is alternately crisp and beautifully lyrical and singing. Both players have total command technically and beautiful sounds. I highly recommend the CD."
5,Wonderful relaxing Instrumental,"This recording by a group of music therapists is an innovative, refreshing visiting of some of the best-loved carols of the Christmas season. Highly recommended."
4,Fun times,"I bought this CD because I remembered a couple of the cuts from when they used to be aired on KJET (if Otto Pilot was working). If you're a collector of fun, obscure music, the ""studio"" disk is worth the price. The band is tight, original, irreverent, and fun (but then, that's how I remember everything being back then) and with maybe a bit better technical assistance in the studio and some marketing, they might have made it to the ""big leagues."" However, maybe the ""live"" disk shows what held them back. I found myself skipping to the next track - a lot - on that disk. Buy it for the studio disk and enjoy."
5,Brilliant!,"Brilliant! Fantastic! Complex, yet energetic and fun music, often hilarious and literary lyrics, combined with great musicianship."
4,Another Winning Crime Novel From Higgins,"I've read most of Higgins's novels. My favorites were the WWII thrillers. But, his crime books are top notch. This one is no exception. Even though it was written back in the '60's and recently reprinted it keeps your complete attention as you quickly turn the pages. This was about a sculptor turned serial killer. Plenty of excitement."
4,Great for the beginner or casual celestial observer!,"This is not the best telescope on the market, but for the price, you definitely can't go wrong. I was amazed at the quality and clarity. With the 9mm lens, you can easily see the rings of Saturn as well as the clouds of Jupiter. With the purchase of a stronger lens and even a magnifier, you are able to get even more definition of celestial objects including but not limited to planets, nebula, and lunar craters. If you are a beginner, or just enjoy the night sky as I do, this is a great way to enhance the experience and maybe learn something along the way.Note: As for delivery, the item arrived in the scheduled delivery timeframe in perfect condition. The only problem was the software was missing but has been sent as I write this review."
3,Interesting but not fully Informative,"The Blue Rebels by S.C. Douglas opens the issue of Northern Born Confederates to many who never believed that existed during the war between the states, but lacks enough exlanation and detail to support some of the statements made in the book. Surely there were and are Confederates in the Northern states to this day, and this book is a great place and asset to any American History historian who wants a starting point for his own research on this topic."
3,"It's hard, besides a few minor problems","This game is hard cause Akuma and Wolverine is on there. They are my best two characters to choose from next to Ken and Ryu. It's cool, but the graphics [are bad]on here. Like, when you do a hyper combo, the graphics go on a blur for a few seconds or however long the combos lasts. But still, get this game cause it's so tight. If you pick Akuma or Wolverine as your first character, start off with some air combos then you'll have the advantage."
5,the king of all the fighting games!,"this game will blow your mind.....it has all your favourite xmen and streetfighter characters..with their best attack,combos you name it!!"
4,It's a great game,"it's a great game, it has some of the classic street fighters and you favorite x-men. it's a lot better in the arcade. but if you're a fighting game freak, it's a must have! .i give XMvsSF four stars out of five! if you do like this game i recommend you to get ""marvel super heroes vs street fighter"" it has different fighters and good colors. it's kinda an update on XMvsSF so if you dont have any of these games you should just go ahead and get MSHvsSF unless you have to get every street fighter related game like me!"
4,Great for many of the reasons other reviewers are calling it bad,"I personally like many types of fighting games and FUN is the thing that keeps me coming back for more. A game can have pretty graphics sound great, and have all the bells and whistles in the world and still play like [...]. This game might not be as pretty as the Saturn version, but who wants a Saturn? One of the biggest flops since the future flop of Sony's [...]PS3. A few frames missing and slowdown which I have not experienced personally are by no means reasons to dismiss a game that combines X-men with Streetfighter very well. One more thing to mention about the price. Not to insult anyones intelligence but simply supply and demand. It is discontinued, there are fewer and fewer copies available thus causing those on the open market to raise in value."
1,Nonsense,"This is a Very bad conversion! at the beginning you choose 2 characters, great i thought and whilst you are playing, you CANNOT switch CHARACTERS at will like the arcade version! Isn't that the whole focus of the game? if you cant switch between characters, then why call this a tag team game?you only get to see 1 life bar, there is 2 in the arcade version of this game (and on the saturn)!The loading times takes ages (to be honest, you would have to wait longer than actually completing the game)!to sum it all up this is a very, very, very disappointing game!"
2,Butchered arcade to home conversion,"To say that the PS1 version of Capcom's X-Men VS Street Fighter is butchered is saying it lightly. What made the game so great in arcades was the tag-team feature in which you picked two fighters and could switch at any time during the fight. This feature made for great fighting fun, but because of the PS1's RAM inabilities, that feature had to be omitted. It's obvious Capcom released this game to make a quick buck on the X-Men and Street Fighter licenses, and while on it's own it can be a solid fighter without the tag-team feature, the graphics are painfully watered down, the game is loaded with sloppy frame rates, and there is loads of slowdown. If you can get past all that, this may be worth checking out if your a Street Fighter fan, but the Marvel VS Capcom games that would be released later on next-gen systems are more worth your time."
1,A completly Washed out version,"i won't get this game, it's a complete disgrace to the arcade version. no tag team feature. major slowdowns, the graphics are completly washed out as if a ravine's water ran over it. and i don't understand why these sellers are selling their copy for [so much money]. this game should be selling for [far less]. only more reason not to get it. do not buy any Vs game for the Ps one all of them the tag team feature has been taken out."
4,200th review X Men vs Street Fighter for SEGA SATURN,X Men vs Street Fighter was a big hit in the arcades everybody said that game was the s**t. The Saturn was the only home port that gave us tight controls great graphics good animation & still had tag team mode unfortunately thanks to Bernie Stolar we in the US didn't get X Men vs Street Fighter nor the 4 MB RAM cart so those of couldn't get the Saturn version got this s**t on the Playstation which is bad on 2D it didn't have tight controls it didn't have beautiful graphics animations were bad sluggish speed oh NO TAG TEAM MODE! I remember renting this version & thinking it was terrible it's just this game wasn't made for The Playstation. Now the Action Replay that bypasses region coading & uses a 1MB & 4MB RAM function I would also require a Ascii Saturn arcade stick for this game too so any owner of The Sega Saturn should get that version it's a great fighting game that plays like the arcade.
3,MIXED FEELINGS,"First off, I've never been much of a fan of John Ritter, (he played Jack Tripper on that inspidid sit-com show THREE'S COMPANY) but this movie isn't soley about him. But anyhow, I thought that the first story in this antholgy was pretty good and the third one. No of course the acting wasn't exactly top notch, but for this type of movie, it'll have to do.Now if you've read the previous reviews, there is no point in my waisting time in describing the strange but funny stories on this video."
3,It's OK but not excellent,"The book is comprehensive and contains almost all what you want in cytopathology. The pictures are nice. However, I couldn't give the book more than 3 stars because of the text. The text is not easy to read and you feel yourself lost when you go through the text (this is in contrast to Cibas book which I believe that it is the best book in cytopathology I have ever read). If Bibo's book has better editing, it should become one of the best books. I recommend you combine this book with other resources."
1,comprehensive cytopathology: expert consult: online and print,"I bought this book from Manhattan Media Mart about $250 and cannot access the online version. Since this book from the Saint Vincent's Hospital Manhattan, which was bankrupcy in 2010. So I only have a book and do not have online access to this book. I was not very happy about this. Next I will buy a new book so that I can access online and it only cause $30 more."
4,Substance w/o the hype!,"Dr. Bibbo's book provides the most scientific approach to cytopathology that I've encountered as a practicing cytopathologist and during my fellowship years. Chapter six is a well organized comprehensive gathering of the science behind the art of cytopathology. A most read, several times, for anyone seriously considering this career as a life-long adventure.Although the pictures in this book are not of the quality of Dr. DeMay's book, its scientific content is impecable."
2,A waste of money!!!!!!!,I purchased this book and seriously regret it. Compared to Demay's text this book is worthless except for its stats info. All of the people I know who have Bibbo use it either as a microscope stand or book end. Please don't buy this book.
3,An OK tribute to a great band,"Tribute CDs are often a mixed bag, and this one's no exception. ""World of the Zombies"" is a powerpop tribute to one of the most talented but, until recently, most overlooked bands of the '60s. The idea, then, of popularizing their songs through 90s powerpop reinterpretations is a promising one.Unfortunately, the product is merely ""OK."" The Posies are excellent as usual, and several other tracks are pleasant standouts, but others--including limp re-readings of ""Girl Help Me"" (one of my favorite Zombies songs!) and ""She's Not There""--don't really go anywhere.All in all, an OK purchase, but somewhat pointless now that the Zombies have been so...critically rehabilitated, perhaps? Whatever the case, make sure you listen before you buy."
1,Not good for saddles,"I purchased this product because of Lexol's claim that it wouldn't darken leather. It did darken the leather a bit, but that is not why I gave it one star. I put it on a high quality vintage saddle that I have owned since it was new. I had cleaned the saddle w Lexol cleaner. I tried a test spot of this stuff on the saddle and it just sat ontop of the leather. I knew the saddle needed oiling since I am the sole owner. Just to make absolutely sure the saddle simply didn't need oiling...I put ""leather new"" oil on another area and it soaked right in. After leather is cleaned and dried...it should accept oil. This stuff reminds me more of a lacquer. I have had good luck w other Lexol products...this one is a dud."
4,Timely updates,"The Adirondack Book is an excellent guide to what to do, where to eat, etc., in the Adirondacks. The format is easy to follow, and the comments/recommendations are pretty much dead on. Not all of my personal favorites have found their way into these pages, but I've definitely been introduced to some new faves. Even if you own previous editions, I recommend buying the newest available--things change, and yesterday's hot spot may well have fizzled."
2,Many weaknesses and out of date,"I bought this book in 2003 when it first appeared and when my family and I first started coming to the ""Dacks"". I strongly agree with the criticism of the book's organization made by other reviewers: that it is arranged by topic rather than region. Perhaps the author thought of this as a ""fresh idea,"" but in fact all it demonstrates is why the traditional approach is best. With this book you do a lot of page flipping, and the indices aren't that helpful. The fifth edition is also now out of date with respect to, e.g.,, restaurant listings in the areas we know."
2,Book is just OK,Not much info on hiking or camping that I found useful. Book is better for history type info.
2,"terrible organization, weak on information","If this is the best guide for the region there is a wide opening for competition. The organization by topic rather than area makes this book virtually useless for planning a trip. Even if one focuses on a single topic (fishing, hiking, ..) there is little guidance for someone choosing where to go -- often there are lists of places with no descriptions or completely useless paragraphs that say, essentially, ""there are many many places you can do X in the Adirondacks."" So I agree that this hardly serves as a guide at all. There is some interesting history in the book that could make this worth buying as background reading."
4,Perfect background music for relaxation/guided meditation,"When I first heard this music years ago, it seemed too slowand not energetic enough for me. However, eventually I began to wind down and discovered the ideal use for the extended Pachelbel: I recorded my own guided meditation and had Kobialkas music in the background. It is perfect for this purpose, creating a very safe space to let go of layers after layers of tensions."
4,CD Timeless Motion,"Love this CD. One of my favorites for years. This one I bought for my Mom for Christmas. I know she'll love it, too!"
3,Not mean. Or odd.,"Vowell travels the country, visiting places presidents have been assassinated. Along the way we see America's obsession with violence and hype, but, strangely, it doesn't feel mean or odd."
4,A fun read-- though skews mostly to Lincoln's assassination,"I really liked this book, but I think it gives relatively less time to Garfield and McKinley."
3,Fun-ish American history lesson.,"I really enjoyed the first half of this book. It focused on Abraham Lincoln and took the author to some interesting places. I found it educational and entertaining, even though it isn't something that I would normally read about.I am not that into recent American history, and that may be why I didn't enjoy the second half of the book as much. Presidents Garfield and McKinley aren't that interesting to me. I didn't think that it was any fault of the author, for she seems to really get into geeking out at historical sites, and likes things that make my eyes melt from the boredom.I think the book is worth reading, just for the first half, and if you are interested in the other two men, you will enjoy it even more."
4,"Vowell a consonant joy to read, err constant","Another great book by the always witty and insightful Sarah Vowell. It's great to see someone named Sarah who actually knows something about American politics. Funny, heartfelt and educational, she's the girl you want to take home to mother (If mother happens to be an American history teacher). Her enthusiasm is infectious and her obvious love for the details of our country's past brings life to great (and nefarious) American characters long since dead."
5,A Fantastic Read,"Vowell, with her laugh-out-loud wit and wry anecdotes, sweeps you up into her passion for ""historical tourism"" and the twisted history of our nation's most reviled historical figures. This a terrific read. Don't let the subject matter put you off... this the rare novel that will have you smiling ear-to-ear - while also prompting some thoughtful reflection on how much has really changed in our nation over its history."
2,Not what it seems,"If you think you are going to get some new insight into presidential history, you will be in for a rude awakening . What you will get is typical whiny Liberal Bush-bashing coupled with some self-important young woman goofing off with her sister, friends etc . Her ""historical research"" consists of something anyone can get spending a couple of hours on the internet . Unless you care about the daily activities of the voice of Violet on the Incredibles and want to learn things like she gets winded hiking up a mountain to see some minor connection to a presidential assasination, don't waste your time.This book is way too chatty and way too preachy. So unless you are a disciple of Michael Moore and Al Franken, in which case you will probably stand up and shout ""You go sister!"" while reading it on the train, take a pass on this one."
3,Political Commentary Turned me Off,"After seeing Sarah Vowell on a recent David Letterman show I was amused by the author's take on political assassinations throughout American history. Quirky historical facts from American history have always interested me, and I was excited to learn more about this book. I thought the audio version would be a great purchase for my iPod, so I listened to a clip of Assassination Vacation on iTunes and was prepared to make the purchase. But when I listened to another audio clip on Audible.com's website, I was disappointed to hear that it was just another political book with more Bush bashing. The book was soon deleted from my shopping cart on iTunes. I will be glad when our country gets over the spiteful political mood we are currently in and we get back to where we were before the recent Presidential elections. I think Sarah Vowell's book would have been be a funny read [listen], but the political commentary ruined it for me."
1,Wishing and hoping...,"Let's see...someone with such a case of BDS (Bush Derangement Syndrome) that she has trouble actually writing his name...""the current president, titter, titter"", who takes a vaction to revisit the assassinations of 3 Republican presidents. Hmmm...I know there's a connection here somewhere.This is what passes for a commentator on NPR these days? The opening bit, where she's sitting in a B&B; and nattering on and on as her fellow guests edge toward the door (more or less) sort of wraps it up quite nicely."
2,Huge disappointment,"Sadly, Ms. Vowell is unable to write about this very fascinating subject in American history without indulging in her own, biased, liberal obsessions. In doing so, she loses serious credibility. An avid reader and history buff, I tried desperately to continue reading this book. Unfortunately, the book became more of an ""I hate Bush sooooo much"" rant rather then a smart read. Rarely do I have to stop reading a book, but with this one, I do so gladly."
2,not a book club book,read this book for book club. it was a big dud. probably wouldnt have enjoyed it otherwise as well.
1,Annoying and inane,"I don't see what all the fuss is about. This book is just a bunch of presidential assassination trivia, strung together by the contrived narrative device of traveling to assassination sites, museums and collections, and peppered with Sarah Vowell's compulsive and not-very-funny wisecracks. It told me nothing about any of the assassinations that seemed to matter, so I gave up on page 171. Save your money, time, and gray matter."
2,Too much political opinion,I bought this title because I was interested in the history it promises to explore. Unfortunately Sarah Vowell uses every opportunity to bash the current administration and draw strange parallels between the McKinley and Bush administrations. If you don't mind listening to Vowell whine about how she hates G. W. Bush then it may be worth the purchase. I personally found her frequent infusion of political opinion annoying and I would not recommend the title to any history buff.
2,"Context 5, narration 0...","Her audio publisher should have advised her to have someone else narrate. She sounds like a thick-tongued, high-pitched school girl. What she has to say is great, I love the writing, but I could hardly endure the voice reading to me. It just wasn't worth it....and it didn't have to be done that way. I will still look for her books--but only the paper paged versions."
4,Assassination,The book was pretty good. I must say it was better than I expected it to be. I like the style of writing and it as more in depth than what you would have read in a newspaper.
2,Tedious,This book could have been condensed into a modest magazine article. Author devoted too much space to rambling minutiae and her unrelated political perspectives.
4,Entertaining and thought provoking,Not only is this book good history but the author makes us stop and look at how history repeats itself. It makes me wonder if more people read history would we stop making the same mistakes? I am pretty familiar with the Lincoln bits bit Garfield and McKinley were new to me for study. I will look for more of her books.
4,"Entertaining & Informative, Except for the Political Screed","Ms. Vowell has written a charming, quasi-travel book based on her pilgrimage to the sites where three presidents where assassinated: Lincoln, Garfield and McKinley. The book is both engaging and enlightening, full of historical trivia that will both amuse and fascinate. Its only shortcoming is the author's undisguised disgust for all things Republican. (Her political biases are revealed early on when she fantasizes about knocking off George W.) Her political judgments are, at times, simplistic, one-sided and boorish. Mercifully, they rear their head infrequently in what is otherwise a delightful book, which I heartily recommend."
5,Highly recommend the audio version...,"I took an interest in this book due to my interest in Lincoln, however I found the entire book highly entertaining (audio version) and couldn't wait to put in the next disc. Luckily we were on a road trip and my spouse, who usually plays the roll of sleeping co-pilot, stayed awake to enjoy this book.If you're choosing between the book or an audio version, I personally found the audio version very worthwhile. Initially I wasn't aware of the author's work with NPR, given that Ms. Vowell is by profession an orator, I feel there is much to gain hearing her deliver her own material.Would you rather listen to your favorite recording artist or read the lyrics?Would you rather hear your favorite comedian deliver their material or read the book?That's my $.02."
4,Very Enjoyable Read,"I'll be brief in light of the dozens of other review of this book. Assassination Vacation is essentially a fun, summer read. The topic is fascinating and I thought the historical trivia was well researched and presented in a way that helped make connections between times, characters and events more tangible. Yes, Sarah Vowell is a bit chatty but the book brought more than a few smiles to my face and I even experienced a couple of ""ah ha"" moments piecing together the time line of American history. Not too shabby for a beach book."
1,Great Idea Horribly Executed,"This is one of the most annoying books ever read. The author totally ruins what could have been a cool premise to learn about American history. Instead her ridiculous ""personality"" takes over and rambles on and on about nothing. I couldn't finish this excuse for a book."
4,Audiobook Review,"Sarah Vowell and all the guest readers do an excellent job of bringing history to life (sounds cliche). Though I'm sure some listeners will think Sarah's voice may be annoying after a couple discs, it didn't bother me. Being abridged, I'm not sure how much was left out from the original text but I'm sure 2-3 more discs would have worth it to get the full book. Though I borrowed this from my local library, this is also a good price for a book on CD, less than $30 SRP...definetly worth the price. One comment about the content: there was little mention of Kennedy?! A book on Presidental assassinations without a huge chapter on JFK just seems odd."
2,A little goes a long way,"The book made me laugh out loud, but the NPR-approved author is glib, always nervously searching for her next punchline, or attempting to insert a proud, treacly story about her nephew Owen.I love me some liberals and consider myself one, but Vowell is the type who is off the charts nuerotic and nerdy; every bit as grating as her pinched voice suggests. While learning many interesting details about assassination history, an image is assembed of the neurotic author as a nut who doesn't drive (a phobia), has allergies, and is some sort of assassination coompletist. Though the book is at no loss for wit, a reader is always aware how insufferable it must be to be in the presence of Sarah Vowell."
2,Didn't care for it...,"This may be an interesting book on witchcraft spells in history, but I was disapointed when I read it. It was a collection of old, mostly non-workable by today's standards spells and hexes. Save your money and time and skip this one!"
1,My first disappointment in this subject matter.,"I own over 70 books on the Craft. This is the first one I have been wholeheartedly disappointed in. I felt this book was nothing more than a bunch of nonesense and babble in a one-page-per-purpose format that left me wanting somthing that made sense. I didn't buy a book, I made a donation, because I got nothing useful for my money."
3,Not the best SF game i've played...,"When I first rented it, I thought it would kick butt like Alpha 3. Boy was i wrong. Not only do the graphics stink, But they've introduced a NEW Ryu clone, Allen. Allen sounds like Elmer Fudd, and has no personality. Buy or rent? Rent first, then IF you like it, buy."
3,"A quick read, somewhat unsatisfying","I had fun reading this book as it moved along a decent pace( nothing I hate worse than authors that pour in more detail than story). However, this ""story"" lacked a lead character that the reader felt strongly about. The concepts, like the single origin for both the Terrans and Raehanivs was a neat subplot that was sort of glossed over. I wished the author would've explored that angle more. The Korvassha were as nasty an enemy as any Niven or Pournelle had come up with. I kept expecting a counterattack but the book just ended. This book had enough going for it to have gone another 100 pages. Maybe there is a sequel?"
4,Sparks Fly Upward,"Stewart Granger is a very entertaining writer. There were lots of surprises in the material. One was the dangerous conditions he faced in making several movies; another the description of what a sick, powerful person Howard Hughes was. It's also enlightening to know which people in the movie industry were nice, and who were not."
5,Glowingly Upbeat Testament to Life and Love,"""The final work of the Obie Award-winning playwright of Zero Positive is a glowingly upbeat testament to life and love, gay and straight, now and forever. Susan and Bill are a New York couple who promise to care for their HIV-positive friend, Hector. But suddenly their marriage is breaking up--and Hector has placed himself smack in the middle.""-- zebraz"
5,Love The Rocky Horror Picture Show....,The picture is amazing and I love the movie.. This is one of my all time favorite movies.. Totally worth the price..
1,The worst,Cam I go less that 1 star? Maybe the worst thing I've ever witnessed. This is truly not worth watching.
3,"Good, but not great",I subscribe to Entertainment Weekly and Stephen King recommended this movie as one of the best this year. The movie was just ok. It was so slow for the first 3/4. It felt dated and I kept waiting for it to get scary. While this is a decent movie it is not in my list of favorites.
3,Entrance - Confused,"I am reading the review above and not sure I know how the viewer found out the killer is someone from Suziey's past. I didn't know if he was a random stalker; the boyfriend of her room-mate...I didn't understand WHO he was?!?!?!? Did I miss something? I thought the movie was ok...very slow burn until the final 20 minutes but it managed to make me feel uneasy through the first hour. Something was just uncomfortable for me and the characters in this movie. The friendship between Suziey and her roomie seemed forced/cold but I thought the actress who played Suziey was wonderful. I understand the goal of the film-makers is to show monotony in Suziey's life and the fact she is so bored and unhappy, which they do well. This, to me, made the end of the movie much more effective (dramatic contrast). The shaky camera made me sick though...I just can't handle this style of filming (yes, I am a whimp)."
5,Texas Places of the Heart,"This book is a visual stunner, published by a graphics company that took pains to get the colors right. Whether he's pointing his lens at wildlife or city life, buildings or byways, Parent turns an artists eye on the places in Texans' hearts."
5,These guys rawk hardcore!,"If you've never heard of Super Deluxe before, you have been missing something wonderful. My personal favorite song on this disc has to be Years Ago, which is something so out of the blue for Super Deluxe to do. Love Liquid Wraparound and Lost in Your Failures are also top-notch songs. A much tighter follow up to Famous, this cd is well worth the price."
4,Clean cut fun,Super Deluxe is a fun group with a good sound. All they need are some good lyrics and they're set.
5,important voice for lesbians or anyone who loves language,"In this collection of poems, writer/editor/teacher Julia Penelope uses words in unexpected ways. She often creates long lists of verbs or verb phrases that reflect a struggle to claim language and identity for all people--not just white, male heterosexuals. In doing so, she asserts her own identity as woman and lesbian and her own power over language in a world that often leaves both female and homosexual voices silent.The language she creates seems almost alien at times, though she mostly relies on common words. I certainly wouldn't call this ""casual"" or ""light"" reading, but I also wouldn't call it intentionally difficult. I would call it defiantly original. Penelope's writing draws power from its uniqueness and unpredictability.(Review reposted, so it would appear with my ""main"" Amazon profile, and more people would learn about this great book!)"
3,Too Sensitive,This thermometer is much too sensitive. When the sun shines on it the temperature increases 20 degrees. If you keep it out of the sun it would probably work fine.
5,Outside temp before you dress!,Did you ever want to know the outside temp before you got dressed in the morning? This is your answer. Mine was so admired by my next door neighbor that I bought one for her as a birthday present.
1,Did not adhere to window,Did not stick to window as advertisedFell off after a short time Would not restick to windowDo not understand this arbitrary word minimum
3,The indicated reading was off by 2-8 degrees,I have used this item for years. They usually work very good and are fairly accurate. The one I bought was off by 2-8 degrees and I returned it. I am going to get one of those remote electronic ones.
4,"A classic, but the WRONG version of one single.","I have been searching for the version of ""Hard Habit to Break"" that I remember from 1984. It has a vocal breakdown at the very end where the vocals go: ""I can't go on/I can't go on..."" like an arpeggio, several times. I cannot find this version for love or money (I just bought two versions on itunes and neither is right). Can anyone tell me the scoop? I can't believe how many people say they ""love"" this song and yet haven't noticed that the version is different from back in the day! Any help would be appreciated."
4,One of their best!,"This is definitely one of my favorite albums of Chicago. From the time I first discovered music at like age 3, this is another classic that I remember well. There isn't a bad song on it. The only bad thing is that this was Peter Cetera's last album with the band. He's an awesome vocalist as well as an inspiring bassist. I would get chills listening to his basslines when I started playing bass 11 years ago. The songs on here all have their catchiness to them as well so it's guaranteed that you'll remember them. Don't sleep on this one."
4,Peter Ceteras final Chicago album - worth it just for his voice,"Hard habit to break and Youre the inspiration were the big hits from this CD, but there is more to it than just those two songs. Stay the night is a good rocker (for these guys) as is Along comes a woman and Prima Donna. Remember the feeling, Please hold on and Once in a lifetime all make the grade. Worthwhile addition to any CD collection."
5,In love with this tea,"For several years I have been drinking a cup of chamomile and/or spearmint tea every night before bed because it relaxes me. I also keep a box of Traditional Medicinals regular chamomile tea at work in case I need something to ease my stomach. I came across the chamomile with lavender in an ordinary supermarket the other day and as soon as I brewed a cup & took a sip, I was in love. I want to know, where has this tea been all my life?!Lavender is known to promote restfulness and is perfect paired with chamomile for a cup of caffeine-free tea at bedtime. Just brewing this tea will ease your stress as it's lavender scent will fill the room. This is aromatherapy in a beverage that tastes delicious."
4,Gem from the past.,"Soundtrack from the movie ""Hatari"". Some excellent Henry Mancini music, with a little twist due to the African motif. Fun if you're a Mancini fan, or a fan of John Wayne movies."
2,Double WeddingRing (as seen on Quilting from the Heartland),"This Booklet has an option to order the mylar templates and does not state that on the package. I bought this for a friend and was very disappointed, as I paid less for the one I bought years ago that included the templates. I feel it misleads the consumer as the packaging is the very same. ISBN 105-5387282-9754654 my copy had no ISBN #. The seller at Angel's Attic had no idea there was any difference when selling."
3,Exotic and Eye Appealing Yet Sketchy on Specifics,"The Art of Preserving is filled with exotic jams,jellies,chutneys, and relishes which are artfully packaged and beautifully photographed. The book is a treat for the eyes! Unfortunately, the author does not provide sufficient detail in her recipes to accurately and safely produce these items. Although an overview of the canning process is provided at the beginning of the book, specific information on how long to process jars is not included with each recipe. If you are a novice canner, I would recommend the Ball Blue Book as good start to your preserving library. Once you are familiar with canning and the necessary steps, you can use the The Art of Preserving for inspiration to jazz up your recipes."
4,Love the gourmet touch to the recipies,"The pictures and the recipies are just wonderful, but I have a problem with ""Blueberry Jam"", page 42. She says to use 1/2 the blueberries initially, but never says when to add the other half to the jam. Anyone out there have any input. My thought would be to do so when adding the sugar, but I'm not so sure...Feedback please...Thanks"
1,Returning,"There is very little in this book that I don't already make. The recipes are very basic. I mean, yellow cake mix? I was enticed by the idea of the mustard recipe, but it is just like one I already have. This is geared for those who buy lots of prepackaged food."
5,It works,"It works for me cheap and accurate compared to a test from USDA. Test with pure distilled water first to use as the basis then begin testing, always use the same location and light source to view tester. Collect samples and bring them to a location where you can work comfortably especially if its cold the little capsules can be a pain to open and use especially if your hands are frozen."
5,Easy and it works!,"Needed to test the pH of some soil where I plan on growing some fruit bushes that need acidic soil. The reviews on the digital/needle pH meters weren't that good so I decided to go with the trusty chemical reaction method. It worked great and it was easy to do. Unfortunately my soil is too alkaline so I need to do some work to get it into the acidic range. Fortunately the soil tester comes with quite a bit of instructions for how to do this. Only downside to this product is that it only comes with 10 capsules to test the soil, but you can order more. Overall I would recommend this over any of the digital/needle soil testers, plus it's a lot cheaper."
4,testing is easy,"Taking a sample of dirt is the hardest part of doing the test. The results are fact finding,, need to retest , to make sure the first test was positive.. come next spring."
4,good tester,this is a good tester for the average home gardener..i also tested my neihbors trees and had goos results..good product for the price
3,Its just as awesomely bad as I remembered it being,"I remember when this tv movie came out while I was in high school. I tried to find it for some time before stumbling on it here. The movie and acting are both terrible, but the nostalgia factor is still fun."
4,It works,"I got an older car and was trying to reduce the rattle in my trunk from the subs. So I covered all the problem areas and my trunk lid with the dynamat and now its 10 x's better. This stuff is heavy like lead, but it cuts easy. I would also reccomend the getting that roller tool, because I didnt use one and its starting to lose grip with my trunk lid in places where I couldnt get it pressed on there even and smooth. This stuff is pretty expensive, but worth it if you need it."
5,Pink for my little princess!,My little princess says that this seat is very comfortable and she gets to use a big girl seat belt! We are very happy!
2,Cute But Not Comfortable,"This seat is good for short trips. My daughter loves the colors on this seat, but complains about a sore rear end after about half an hour due to a lack of seat padding. She also has a hard time sleeping on trips due to the upright positioning of the seat- her head bobs forward and she gets a stiff neck. Since the seat needs to be flush against the back of the actual car seat, it's not adjustable for comfort. It's kind of a pain to move between cars too- the seat back releases very easily from the base and we keep dropping the base. It just feels flimsy. The stationary armrests make it difficult to buckle the seat belt and adjust it. It'd be great if they flipped up out of the way."
2,a little on the cheap side,"Recieved product as discribed. Thought quality wold be better than this. I have purchased many items from Opteka and all were higher quality than this unit.I have tried several times to get negatives in focus with this product and discovered that you have to play with the different macro lenses to get a proper focus on every negative.Also where the assy screws to the camera it just keeps spinning and never tightens. Threads look clean and undamaged on the unit and all my lenses screw properly and very easily to my camera adapter. The leveling part of the unit is ""turn in one direction only"", this part is very very tight and you have to use to much force to turn it making it very hard to get negative in a level position.If money wasnt so tight right now I would pay shipping to return it, but I cannot afford it so I will live with it."
5,Wonderful soft pastels and goofy counting to 10.,"From the exuberant zebra dancing across the inside binding (and boy does he dance!) to the delightfully goofy illustrations, this book is charming.The words are just the sort of snuggly stuff your baby will love.Counting to ten with the sweet things in a babies life (one sweet smile, two adorable eyes, three big bananas etc etc what do you get? One beautiful baby) And one charming book.Wonderful soft pastels and goofy counting to 10.Kotori 2004"
2,Great illustrator BUT...,"This book is very sweet and has beautiful pictures, but there's a few problems. I agree with the reviewer who mentioned that young babies should not eat strawberries, so the book reinforces an inappropriate idea. Also, I do not think the book works as a counting book, because in several of the illustrations, the items to be counted are in the middle fold of the book and you cannot see them clearly (at least in the edition I checked out from the library). A better book by this illustrator is ""What Shall We Do With the Boo-Hoo Baby?""."
1,"Looks nice, but it is poorly made.","I bought it because it looked nice, had the covered spout and was reasonably priced. But once I opened it, the little straw-like thing inside the spout was oxidated. So when I contacted Klinq customer service, they refused to refund but wanted to send me a replacement. After a month of waiting, I finally got the replacement set and it had the exact same problem. The material that is made of is corrosive. What is worse is that Klinq did not bothered checking the product before selling it even after I brought it up to their attention."
2,Item quantity decieving,"I should have read the other reviews and noticed that only one came, with no choice of colors. I could have gotten the 7 inch one on amazon for less."
2,Floating Lily Pad,"Unfortunately I thought these LITTLE pads lit up. My mistake, but too much to send back. $6.00 on a $16.00 purchase. Not worth it. Stuck with them."
3,Not too Bad,"I ordered three and they're okay. They sent two purple and one pink which is fine, but they didn't include the nylon line and weight that the ad says it comes with. All and all, they seem okay if you want something low priced to spruce up your pond."
4,Clean burn no mess good candle!,Good candle for when you need a little light! Almost no drips! Works well on its own or in the UCO lantern. Worth the $$$ when the lights go out!
3,It's candles... what more is there to say?,Short fat candles... it is what it is. They were cheap and nice to have as a 'just in case' candle for your car in the winter or a 72 hour pack.
5,Perfect for an emergency kit,"Great little candles. They will come in handy. You must provide your own fire, it's not included."
5,Work Fine,"What can you say about a candle? They fit my lantern and work as advertised. As for 9 hours, can't say didn't time them."
3,Average,"Bought these to use with the UCO lantern. After trimming the wick to approx 3/16"", these only burn for about half the claimed time. Definitely not a 9-hour candle, but certainly not a deal breaker. I'll try the beeswax and citronella to see if they're any better. Note: if you use the UCO lantern be prepared to dig melted wax out of the innards."
2,ummm..,More like 4 hour candles. These things didn't last an evening while I was burning them with some friends. I'd pass on them. They also dripped wax everywhere and went out easily.
4,I hope I never have to see how these work,I also purchased the little lantern made to accept these candles for my emergency supplies. The design of these candles and laterns seemed interesting. Bottomline I hope that I never have to use these...
4,Before the War on Terror,"This book is a chilling expose of its title - unspeakable acts by ordinary people. The book documents how torture in the ""civilized"" west -- Northern Ireland, Israel, and the US -- did not begin with the current war on terror. These brutal practies have deep roots in the routine activities of law enforcement and the demonization of the ""enemy,"" whether they be Catholics, Palestinians, or black people. Followng the well known argument of Hannah Arendt, the book demonstrates the depth of the problem of human rights abuses by Western police officers carrying out what they believe to be their duty."
1,Dont waste your money,"Not only is this dvd from like 1981, its get you dizzy the camera bounces up and down. It reminds me of the old films in grade school. This film should not to be used for a travel guide, more like a history class guide. The box says 2005 and with all of mexico beaches and tourist destniation, forget it's all a lie. It about places you will never visit and nothing on vocation just history."
1,Blank CD,"The CD arrived wrapped in plastic. However, there was nothing at all on the CD. It was blank. We tried it on 3 different CD players which work. There was no sound.We decided not to send it back, just to forget it. But it's good to have a chance to let you know.PS If you'd like to send me another with music on it, I'd be happy."
1,Fax,"I did not like this product. It was too complicated to hook up. I have a auto repair business with multiple phone lines. I hired a phone technician hired in to hook it up. He tried and ended up telling me to send it back. The vendor told me that I had this product too long , so I couldn't return it. I ended up throwing it away."
3,alexander grown up,not as good as the first book in this seriesi was a little disappointed in the second one here but would still read the third one just to finsih the series
3,Reasonably interesting,"A popular rendition of the Alexander's history. A bit kitsch a times, but still good if you cannot digest standard history text."
2,Mary Renault you have nothing to fear...,"Just because you might have an archeological degree does not necessarily mean you're a very good Alexander historian or Makedon expert. The first book in this series was boring-something even Alexander's worst enemies never claimed he was. This book is only slightly better because Alexander led a life of action. From the laugh out loud sexual encounters, to the cries of the Macedonians ""Alexandre! Alexandre!"" (excuse me Mr. Translator, but that would be ""Alexandros, Alexandros"" - in Greek please) to the incredibly stupid-appearing generals of Alexander, this book will make you wonder how Alexander ever figured out how to get out of Makedon."
1,"Save your money, please.","Just search for ""Fire from Heaven"" by Mary Renault. Don't waste your time and money on this schlock like I did. I wound up selling the whole 3 book series for $5 on a popular auction site. It is insipid.Anyone who writes a positive review on this trite nonsense is either a liar interested in its financial success or a fool."
2,simple tub toy,The toy is simple to use but the water doesn't stay in the tubes! Its fine for young ones who don't mind the toy really not working...
3,Unlucky horn,"When I checked before buying the reviews were split and I knew it would possibly disappoint. Sure enough, the sound quality isn't that great and two of them sound flat or off or something, but it just isn't as clear as the others. I think I was unlucky and got one of the bad ones because others really loved this and we are just so so."
2,Leaked from the stary,The product we received did not hold water in the first chamber so we were disappointed from the start. My 2.5 yr old wanted a trumpet for Christmas and she hasn't touched this since the first time she used it in the tub.
2,I was expecting a good movie,"for the likes of it I was expecting a nice sci-fi, fighting movie with a lot of good stuff but then it turned into a mushy tale.This one is about Rutger Hauer and he is killed by his friend played by Mark Dacoscos and then he is brought back to life by scientists so he can kill his nemesis. sort of like The Crow as Hauer is killed and then he is brought back to life to avenge his death. theres nudity in this one"
2,Ultra-futurism at its best?,"The title character is an American weapons smuggler in Russian territory in the far flung future. In the middle of a transaction, he is betrayed by a close friend to the authorities, resulting in his death. He is brought back to life by Russian scientists and let loose to trackand destroy his betrayer who is part of a famous crime ring. Not for anyone against nudity or technology."
3,"Rapology V2 #21, anyone selling the others?","There's a few tracks on this collection that should have been left off. I wish the remixed tracks were clearly printed on the artwork, but it's a pleasant suprise to hear them. Slick Rick's track here is a Dread Remix (by Jazzie B of Soul II Soul,) and ""Be A Father To Your Child,"" is also the remixed version used for the video (very rare and may not be on any other CD, but correct me if I'm wrong...) I remember a lot of these songs from this compilation, but they are forgettable. It's worth the purchase for the two remixes alone."
5,Safe Within My CD Collection,"An odd, intriguing, and beautifully executed mish-mash of styles. I've occasionally heard ""My Love Is Real"" sung by some woman over the muzak at my local supermarket. This album ought to be cherished by most Alt-country fans for both its pop and traditional sensiblities. ""Safe Within Your Arms"" is my favorite song on here. I hope he follows it up with another one soon. It was produced, engineered, and mixed by David Kahne (the man who fired Wilco from Reprise) and I wonder how the sound of this album compares to Garing's live arrangements. I'd love find out."
2,I'm fed up with these books,"I bought these two book for one reason: to get help implementing algorithms. Since there is lot of code in these books, I thought this would be a good pick. I was wrong. The author is consistently leaving out details vital to understanding the code. He also makes a big deal about abstract data types. This is gloriously of the case. If the readers are supposed to understand the code, transperency would be a more intelligent goal for the author. There are no comments in the code what so ever (yes, this is actually true, not even in the on-line code). The on-line code to this book is a total mess. You would be able to implement all the algorithms from scratch in less time than it would take you to try an piece together the code the author has left for you.The pity is that there are very few other algorithm books that have real code. Demand a new edition from the author and don't by this one unless you can avoid it."
5,Great Groove,"I don't have too much to add that the other positive reviews didn't say already. Just wanted to add my rating to bring up the overall. It's definitely 5 star worthy. Perfect when you want to chill, groove, swing, rhyme, or get funky. Great vibe all around! I love this album and listen to it often!"
4,"Philadelphia Daily News - February 25, 2003","NEW FACES: San Francisco singer-songwriter Essence makes her nationaldebut with ""Mariposa"" (Or Music), an ear-grabber from first note tolast. Her pliant, intimate vocals are applied to edgy, impressionisticlyrics about liaisons both dangerous and exultant.

2,Not very good,"It's just not very good songwriting--catchy melody doesn't mean good. My verdict is still out on her voice, too. She certainly has great control but I'm not sure that the tone of her voice is all that wonderful. It grates on my nerves after a bit of listening. Sorry."
1,Not so great.,"This guitar did not feel like it would last very long. I did not like the strings, felt cheap. There is a horrible paint/vinyl smell I really did not want around my child. Sound quality was not that great. I returned it and recommend:Lauren LA30 30"" Student Guitar"
2,Toy Only. Not even close to playable.,"I should have read the reviews more closely. My daughter had asked for a real guitar and not the toy models she had. I bought this thinking that it would be a better quality than those available at retail stores. Not even close. Its poorly constructed to say the least. There is no way a child can actually use this guitar to learn a thing. It's out of tune with one strum. The neck that the headstock were constructed with stone tools. It's hard to gain an appreciation for playing when you have to pick splinters out of your hand. But I digress. If your young child has a real desire to learn the instrument look elsewhere. If you want an overpriced toy, this is it."
3,Average,"I wanted a guitar for my daughter but I didn't want anything too expensive. I also didn't want anything too cheap. This guitar is just ""ok."" The strings are fairly loose but will strum a tune. The tuning isn't right on either. The material is ""ok"" there are a few scratches and dents. Definetly looks like it was made in china. If you want the guitar just as a play toy it will do, but if you want one to introduce hoping your child may get interested in playing guitar I reccomend getting a real acoustic one made with real wood and real strings."
2,"Decent toy, but not a real instrument","I'm satisfied with the purchase in the sense that I was looking for something guitar-like (to begin teaching my 2-year old girls how to care for delicate instruments), toddler-sized, toddler-durable, and made noise. It passes those simple tests.The package comes with a tuning guide a song book. Throw them away. The guitar is barely able to be tuned (and doesn't stay in tune) and the fretting isn't close to being intoned properly even when playing simple chords. I didn't EXPECT that it would be playable for a $30 toy, but for anyone looking for a guitar with the intent teaching a child to PLAY GUITAR on, this is not the guitar you're looking for."
4,What I was looking for,"I got this for my 2 year old son since he likes his daddy's guitar. It is just the right size and looks like the real thing. It sounds pretty good too. My husband quickly broke a string as he was tuning it, but other than that it seems pretty well made."
4,A great toy - but not a real guitar,"""Santa"" brought this for my 2 and a half year old - he loves it. Since he was 1 he had a small plastic guitar that he loved to play - so this is a great upgrade. It is made of wood and sounds closer to the real thing than the plastic one did... however - it is clearly a toy. I think anyone over 4 won't like it as much; you might want to spend the extra money for the ""real"" thing... but this guitar is the right price for what what my son Dylan uses it for."
1,Thumbs Down!,"I was hoping to see Mardi Gras street scences, and even some biGG titted views. Nope! Just a bunch of aneorexic, white broads with a lesbo bent. It seems that most of the action took place on the company bus, that got old, quick! I got betterresults"" from the cheaper competitors."
2,"A flawed, if ambitious, anthology","This work is unique in that it seeks to present both Spanish and Latin American literary movements in one volume. This is a wonderful idea, and transatlantic studies of this sort make a lot more sense than teaching literature in a vacuum. Of course, every anthology can be criticized based on the texts it includes or leaves out. This work does a generally good job of being balanced, but nonetheless commits one criminal error, which prompts my low score: it omits the 18th century entirely. That's right, this work jumps from the Baroque to the Romantic eras without skipping a beat, omitting great authors like Moratin, Feijoo, Cadalso and others. This is both surprising and also downright illogical for an anthology seeking to be a comprehensive overview."
4,Great Collection,"This book has a wide variety of spanish authors and works, featuring the typical representatives of each movement as well as some lesser known authors in some of the movements. Been studying spanish for a while now, and this is one of the most comprehensive literature books i've been able to get my hands on."
5,Brilliant!,This is an incredible collection of music old and new. The title serves it well. All the music is extaordinary.
5,saw part of it on public TV,"I saw the last half of this on TV last summer, I thought it was really interesting how they used baseball to relate the culture of America to Japan. Really, it was just a story about high school baseball in Japan, but in their dedication and hard work you can see the values that define the Japanese culture. It was dramatic and emotionally moving in parts, and that was one thing I really liked about it. It sends a heartfelt message to the viewer and that is what made me want to buy it to see the whole film."
4,"Nice knife, could be sharper","A great all around knife. Nice subdued color scheme. Comfortable grip, nice full guard and buttcap.Light enough for all day carry, yet heavy enough chopping work. I believe the D2 tool steel willtake punishment.That said, it could be alot sharper, and is difficult to sharpen. Considering I won it on ebayfor $68.00 delivered, i decided to invest a bit more and sent mine to [...] to give itthe edge it deserves."
3,D2 Steel,"D2 steel is hard, very hard when it compared to other knife metals.D2 is hard to sharpen but once you get a good edge it will hold very well.However D2 will chip and break on you a lot easier than other metals, The end cap on mine broke the second day I used it, it snapped right off at the tang.As far as for survival knives go I would go with the regular Ka-Bar next gen knife in 1095 steel, much better."
1,This Is Only My Opinion,"The very first time I used this knife on a large solid piece of wood, the blade bent from the handle over a degree to the left, and the very tip of the blade (approx. 1/8"") snapped off. I am not in the military, nor am I an expert in the proper use of knives, but it seems that perhaps a real KA-BAR knife with such a great reputation should not bend and break the first time it is used.My opinion is that I may have been sold a cheap knock-off KA-BAR knife. Not sure how prevelant an issue that may be in the knife industry. Just a warning if you are considering buying a KA-BAR that is made of ""D2"" steel from any seller on Amazon."
1,Kbar Extreme POS,"I am very familiar with knives and the steel that they are constructed from and if this is a D2 steel knife then my German Shepherd is a duck. This is the absolute worst knife I have ever had. I watched the destruction test on You Tube and thought great, I will try it out. The very first time I tried to split some kindling wood with it, the blade broke in half down the middle near the serrated edges. I would have to say to the manufacturers of this knife, quit lying in your product review or say what it is the most extreme piece of @#$% ever.........."
1,no knife,just recived the package that had the knife in it and i open the knife bot and all that is in the box is the sheath no actual knife WTF i am extremely pissed off.
4,Color problem,"The knife appears to be gray-ish in the photo, but when I received it, I found it to be black. I'm not terribly disappointed that it's black, I just wish the photo was accurate."
3,Tip broke,"I was super excited to get this knife as it is highly reviewed and most people are really happy with it. The first three weeks i had the Kabar D2 it far exceeded my expectations. Super sharp, felt good in my hands and was easy to use. Then about two days ago, i was using the knife to try and pop open my problematic patio door. (wood door w/wood jam) and before i had even put five pounds of pressure on the knife to pop the door open, the very tip of the knife broke off. Only about 1 or 2 mm actually broke off...but seriously? This is supposed to be D2 steel made by a great knife company and before i had even begun to apply any kind of pressure...the tip breaks off. Very disappointed in this highly regarded knife."
4,Great blade,"Great blade and well balanced. Sharp out of box, I can shave hair on my arm with it.Only negative point is the craftmanship (maybe I am a liitle perfectionist, and it's not a presentation knife that was carefully decrated), not sure if this happens on most of the kar-ba knives: the rivet joining the handle and the tang is exposed and the Kraton G at the spot looks a bit ugly. This doesn't affect the functionality though."
3,Great travel writing,"Zaire isn't easy to get through, but the author certainly gave it her all making the trek. As a travel piece, I'd give it five stars. However, I'm deducting a couple of points for the politics. I disagree strongly with the author's conclusions/assessments. She and her partner shouldn't have been so surprised by their ""arrest"" just before leaving; while others were left to rot in jail, tortured, etc. they were able to feast at the embassador's residence under a sort of ""house arrest"" until Mobutu finally got sick of toying with them and gave their passports back."
5,Take them myself...,"My kids (6 and 2) take these daily, as do I. If we lapse, we get sniffles or whatever germs are going around. As long as we're consistent, we stay healthy, and you can't beat that! They taste like the old Bayer children's aspirin (tart but tolerable). Great product!"
3,A fun read with lots of history,"This is my first VW history book and it was very interesting. I enjoyed the detailed history of the company especially during and right after the war, however it's one failing, in my opinion, was mentioning something and then moving onto another subject. I wanted more details about some pictures and not so many pictures of the same things. For instance there was a picture of a wood burning beetle, but no description of how it worked, yet there were at least 3 pictures of the Super beetle suspension which showed the same thing. All in all though, I enjoyed reading this book and all the VWs in production are covered."
5,love pink,this pink set is great you have every size you will ever need and more. very durable and made well.if you love PINK you must have this set
4,ENCHANTING!,"CLEVER AND ENTERTAINING! PALINDOR BY D.R. EVANS FOLLOWS IN A FINE FANTASY TRADITION, AND BREAKS A FEW RULES ALONG THE WAY! I LOVED THIS BOOK; IT WAS THE PERFECT READ AT A TIME WHEN I SERIOUSLY NEEDED AN ESCAPE FROM THE REALISM OF EVERYDAY LIFE. D.R. EVANS BRINGS HIS CHARACTERS VIVIDLY ALIVE; THEY ARE BOTH FANTASTIC FANTASY FIGURES AND FAMILIAR FRIENDLY FACES. THE SETTING WAS EXQUISITE, AND THE STORY LINE PROVES THAT ULTIMATELY, GOOD DOES TRIUMPH OVER EVIL! HIP, HIP HURRAH!"
4,Excellent,"Hi, for those who don't live in Canada, this special was on the Muchmoremusic channel, which was awesome so I taped it.And hey, she can sing, she isn't lip-synching. The songs are fun......my favourite is the first one. It sounds different from the CD bodyLanguage version. It's cool because I have all the tracks from the DVD on mp3 format to burn onto CD. You can get most of her mixes on the DC++ program (which is like a file sharing service) the address for the Kylie Hub is kyliehub.mine.nu:4012Enjoy!"
4,Kylie Minogue - Body language Live,I really enjoyed this.Kylie put on a great show.The highlight for me was Secret (take you home). Brilliant song.A great buy for any Kylie fan.
5,Super Cool / Sleek / Sturdy,Really nice glass set. Has a good heavyish weight and a nice clear shiny look. How could you not like that mug shot - soo adorable!
5,A Ferry Gem,"There is music that seems perfect for late at night...lights off...glass of wine...a pleasant companion. Two albums that make the list as ""Best late night music"" are Bryan Ferry's Avalon, and this album ""Boys and Girls"". Although today, MP3 players have put the focus on individual songs, ""Boys and Girls"" is like a Mozart symphony...it is a single piece of music, meant to be listened to in a single session...or put your CD player on repeat and just let it play throughout the evening. Late night magic."
3,Phoenix Rising?,"After the Roxy Music hiatus (post-'Siren') and subsequent reformation ('Manifesto'), Bryan went into a hiatus of sorts in his own solo career (1978-85). Unfortunately this time, time was not so kind. While this is certainly a pleasant-enough collection, with several strong tracks, it lacks the striking originality of much of his previous work. Rather, it feels like a reclaiming of the 1980s 'new romantic' mantle that he had (unwittingly?) given rise to in the 1970s. Justified, yes, but not so impressive, since it seems like he is showing the young upstarts how it is REALLY done rather than coming up with something completely new. Still good stuff though..."
1,End of the line,"This is the album that soured me on Bryan Ferry, as he had finally--after years of decline--distilled his once-inspired artistry into beautifully crafted but meaningless ""romantic"" muzak. Never have so many musicians been assembled to create such static, boring readings of minimalist lyrical/musical sketches (I'd stop short of calling them songs). Roxy's ""Avalon"" was as good as he was ever going to get with this style, and to do such a pallid imitation of that LP on ""Boys and Girls"" (and every subsequent album) reduced him from an interesting artist to a lazy, complacent hack. It's a shame, because Bryan Ferry was once one of the greats."
5,Oldie but Goodie,I heard the song Don't Stop the Dance years ago and bought the cassette {CD's weren't out yet}. I had to have it again. I love it and recommend it.'
2,"great knife if you only use it in one way, otherwise it's painful","Being a fan of the Ka-bar fixed blades (#1250, #1249, #1225, #1217), I tried this one. Works fine if you hold in your hand, and use the thumb knob to open. If you open in any other way (such as holding upside down, and use centrifugal force to open the knife), it bounces out of the locked position. This is how I normally open my knifes when pulled from the sheath and this resulted in a cut in less than a minute of owning this knife. First thing I've had to return to Amazon."
4,Beast of a Knife,"The mule is a beast of knife, the knife was built to be abused. I keep this knife in my truck and it gets abused quite often on camping trips and what not. The mule is a a little heavy, but I like a little heft to my knives so I dont mind the weight at all. I know there are some questions about the lockback system on this knife, Since there are some videos on you tube showing it failing. Kabar has since fixed there lockback problem on this knife I have beat on the spine and it has never failed me, it locks up very solid and it is a very reliable knife. If you are looking at purchasing a hard use knife I would give this knife a very hard look you will not be disappointed."
1,Counterfeit.,"If you're concerned with purchasing OFFICIAL Banpresto plush, then this isn't for you. The ANBU Kakashi plush was never made at a 14"" size, like the Itachi plush, it was only made at an 8"" size. The plush pictured in the image is a Hong Kong counterfeit."
2,A good set.,This set is a small one but a good one. There are more bloks than the winter battle set.The figures are detailed and resemble the characters in the movie. Overall a good set.Includes Peter and a Minotaur
2,A poor effort at reproduction,I didn't mind so much that it wasn't in color (like the original). I didn't even mind that it didn't have the same picture on the cover. What I did mind is the the printer should have turned their reproduction 90 degrees and then it would have fit properly on the pages. The original print and pictures are often cut off the edge of the page. This had nothing to do with the quality of the original book as stated in their description of the reproduction.
4,Best English language biography,"An excellent biography on one of the most elusive leaders of Europe. The book can get bogged down in minute details of WWII policy, but nonetheless provides a well-rounded view of who de Gaulle was--family man, soldier, general, president. He clearly had his own vision for France and did not want to be beholden to Anglo-American interests. While one may not agree with some of his positions, one has to respect the man for desiring a France that could stand on her own feet.His story is also a sad one. The man who fought so hard for his country and was given a heroes welcome in 1945 is forced from office by the late 1960s."
4,old fashioned drawings but a good techniques reference,"The drawings showed are a bit old-fashioned but there are plenty of tips and techniques. There are not many books on markers nowadays, so this one is a kind of excential if you're learning how to use it."
4,Real Good Sax For the Price,"I recently purchased this Sax and was very surprise of the quality and tone of this instrument. Being a student Saxophone, you can't beat the price for its workmanship. My Saxophone teacher was also surprice of the tone of this instrument. There was one problem I had. The joint connecting the neck to the body of the instrument was loose. It had a lot of movement even when I tightened the tension screw. I called the seller, he told me what to do to rectify the situation. All is well. Overall Iam very happy with my instrument at this price. Tony M Congers New York."
3,Carhartt active jacket,"This jacket is about what I expected from Carhartt--well-constructed and warm. The reason it doesn't get a four-star rating is that the zipper is warped and sticks. I sent the first one back to Altrec explaining the problem and asked them to check the replacement before sending it. The replacement had exactly the same problem. I sprayed some silicon on a paper towel and wiped it on the zipper. Then I rapidly zipped and unzipped it many times to the point that the zipper is still a bit catchy, if you will, but acceptable. However, it is not smooth as the zipper on my Carharrt sweatshirt, which never had this problem."
5,great deal,38 dollars so cheap. they sell them in town for 80. brand new nothing different than theirs but the price. fast deliver . be wearing it for yrs to come
5,5 stars,"I bought this for my dad as a Christmas gift. I haven't given it to him yet, but I know he is going to love it. This is an awesome price for a brand as nice as Carhartt and the jacket really looks great. I would definitely recommend this as a gift for any male you know."
5,Happy with purchase,"Son was very pleased with fit, price & quality. Wears it all the time! Washes well and seems to hold up to lots of wear! Keeps him warm and made him happy so I am happy."
5,Very Pleased,"Given the price of this set, I was skeptical ordering it, but I must say that it has exceeded my expectations. Nicely made, all needed cutters and pliers in miniature form, but not too small. Perfect for computer work, cutting wire, etc. Highly Recommended."
5,Great mini plier set for electronics and jewelry,"When we needed a needle nose plier for some electronic and jewelry projects, it was easier and cheaper to buy off of amazon than at stores around town. I can't speak for these on heavy duty projects, but they worked great for the light duty projects. They seemed just as well made (if not better) as pliers that cost twice as much."
4,good flats wade shoe,"Mine have held up well on FL flats, and feet stay warm during Winter wading. I bought up-size, then use 3/4 rigid arch support along with low-cut lycra or similar socks. Comfortable all day. Height and strap a big pluse over standard design water shoes"
5,Great visual aid,"I have a 6 yr old daughter with Down Syndrome and a 3 yr old with Autism. This DVD kept their attention and wasn't too much over their heads. It wasn't overstimulating or too silly cartoonish either. The have a boy and girl at a playground help teach, the creator, Wendy teaches with a blue screen behind her a clock and they also have cuckoo bird cartoon character. They had some good ways to help the kids learn and remember the concepts with clapping and sing-song phrases. I think this is a great resource and explains telling time very well and in a clear yet fun manner."
3,Telling Time?,"Munchkin Math has certainly helped my nephew get familiar with telling time. Although he still has some difficulty grasping the concept, I can see that he's not so hesitant to answer me when I ask him to tell me what time it is."
5,I wish I watched this when I was a kid,I had so much trouble learning how to tell time. My teachers didnt even try to help me so when I had my first baby I searched for a DVD to help my kids. It holds my 3 and 1 1/2 yr olds attention it's simple. I thank them for a great product.
1,DVD not working!,"My four year old twins liked this video, well what they could see of it. It arrived damaged, almost looked like sun damage on the back. Lame."
1,Poor Quality,"Causes extreme ghosting on monitor. I expect this is due to the fact that the cable has very thin shielding -- much less than a standard 6ft monitor cable. I bought this because I wanted to get my computer off my desk and out of the way, but was completely useless to me. Threw it away."
2,"Not recommended, thin cable, bad picture!","This very light-weight and cheap feeling 25' cable produced hazing and ghosts in the VGA signal, worse with the higher resolutions. Further reading indicates that it is due to improper impedence rating of the cable, which means it is just cheap materials. If you need a VGA cable to go 25', get it heavy shielded and pay.. or you will end up paying twice.Very disappointed."
1,Bad cable! BAD!,"Just incredibly awful quality. It causes ghosting and image problems that weren't there before. Considering it has gold connectors, I've no idea why it just so awful. And yet, I bought two, and had exactly the same performance from both, so it's not just a case of one faulty cable.Avoid! Run away! Don't buy!"
4,Works fine.,"This is a monitor extension cord that I put in place a year or two ago. It has worked well every day or two since then. Very good, reliable, etc."
4,Running a long VGA cable....,"isn't ever the best idea, but this definitely got the job done. I can't say that I ever had any issues with the quality of signal produced by this cable."
3,Left (Male) Connector NOT 15-pins,"Advertised as 15-pin male connector. Photo shows 15-pin male connector. Product is actually 14-pin male connector.I imagine this works fine if all you need is 14-pins. But if you need 15, it's useless."
1,Puzzling Shapes,"My daughter plays with this book everyweek in the church's family room, so I thought she'd enjoy one of her very own. I purchased a used copy and was disappointed. The book was intact, however all the pieces were missing. That was the fun part! Requested a return or exchange, never got a response for either. VERY disappointed in seller."
2,Nice idea - poor execution,"Like all of the series - generally good subject matter and a dash of learning. The idea is scenes with the shapes (circle, oval, triangle etc.) outlined in the picture (wheel on a train, door in a house etc.) - great idea. But the shapes are not attached, just little cutouts. The problem is that all the shapes in this book come out so of course any child will lose half of them by week two. Secondly when you try and put the shapes back into the book (you tak eit out to see the shape) it is tough for an adult to do it, worse enough a kid. The fit is too tight. So they go in loose and have a tendency to fall out.All in all a novel idea, but does not make any sense for kids. Skip it."
2,poor,"well, my 13 mo. liked it at first,but she tried to lift the shapes and got so frustrated (impossible, hard even for me) and then terribly dissapointed- there was NOTHING behind the shape but text ( name of a shape) which of course she can't understand. Also she tries to lift parts of the drawings which have no cut outs! I am making a sad face and say- there is nothing there, sweetie..... I got it for a bargain, but it's not worth 7 $...and certainly not for a baby Einstein."
5,A favorite for my 21 month old,"We have had this book for over a year, and at first I kept it put away because my daughter didn't have a desire to match up any shapes, just chew them. At around 18 months we brought it out again and now she loves it. She can say many names of the shapes and loves to match them back to their spot. The shapes were difficult to remove at first but are broken in now. It is the 'toy' that holds her attention the longest right now."
3,"Pretty, but not very engaging","Super-mellow, downtempo electronic soul ballads, sort of in a languid, Sade-ish mode. Not my cup of tea, really, and not as engaging or as stylistically adventurous as other releases on the Trama label. Still, if you just want some relaxing makeout music, sung in another language, this might fit the bill."
4,Excellent,"John M. Ford's latest is another in a string of excellent novels by an author who doesn't receive the praise and recognition he deserves. Ford's novels are all fabulously inventive. 'The Last Hot Time' is no different.This novel is about a young man in an alternate world where Faerie exists. Danny Holman is 'called' to Faery where he becomes Doc Hallownight, the personal physician to a mysterious gangster-type figure.What I love most about this book are Ford's fascinating characters. He's created a relatively large ensemble cast, all of whom receive roughly equal time sharing the spotlight with Doc. The forlorn newspaper reporter. The babbling beauty with a voice to die for. The Elf assassin. Ford's menagerie is endlessly inventive and interesting. I was sorry to see this novel end after only 200 pages.I highly recommend this novel. One of my favorites from 2000."
5,"In this genre, definitely a five-star book!","R. L. Crossland's novel is a thriller about a daring rescue attempt in the Siberia of the Stalinist gulag - a kind of Saving Private Ryan for the Cold War era, while ranging in space and time from Viet Nam to Algeria to the Sea of Japan. Most of these kinds of books are written by writers who do tremendous research, but admit that all their knowledge is book-learning. Crossland is a retired Navy SEAL officer, diver, parachutist, etc., so the story has an immediacy that comes from experience. It is also singularly intelligent. Even if you don't catch the classical references, the book will still captivate you."
5,Extensive Coverage,"I really like Finley-Holiday's National Park series, but I was expecting this to be a bit of a rehash. I was pleasantly surprised to find that there seemed to be very little reused footage from the individual park videos. More importantly, this video covers much, much more than just the major national parks in the Grand Circle. Quite a few state parks, especially in southern Utah, were included. If you're planning a trip to the Southwest, this would be a very good planning tool.As with all the F-H videos I've watched, the footage and video quality were great. My only complaint was that the narration seemed a bit rushed at times - probably because they were trying to fit so much in.I ordered directly from the Finley-Holiday website and had no difficulty receiving my order."
5,Excellent value,"Very easy to erect. I had to help my husband hold the curved overhead pieces for a few minutes, otherwise he did it all alone. Overhead pipes, he reinforced with screws to make it extra sturdy. This will serve our purposes well to insulate, heat if needed, to winter our growing orchid collection. Heavy plants will hang just fine from the strong thick galvanized steel. The shipment came in 3 boxes in about 6 days, but one box was ripped and three connectors were lost. The company sent new in a timely fashion."
1,You are in my prayers,"To all supporters of this book and it's authors, I ask you to remember that CHRIST commanded us to LOVE one another! If we say that we are Christ 's disciples , then we are called to live and speak with gospel charity. I am saddened by your apparent hatred for all of us who love Christ and His church. ..but Jesus told us that we would be hated because of His name. All of you will be in my prayers that our Lord grants you the peace that you are looking for.Love in Christ"
1,With Christ or against him,"""If you are not with me, you are against me"". Christ already said it. You can be with the Catholic Church or against it; with the Pope or against him. And Berry and Renner are clearly against the Church and the Pope.This book will divide like the Gospel does. One star or five.If you have no faith and wish the Church would permit birth control, homosexual relationships, etc., then you will like the book. If you care for truth and love true Catholic doctrine, this book will be an offense to you and to your faith.The part about the Legion is written with furious hatred. There is no objectivity. You can spare yourself the pain of reading such calumnies."
1,Time will tell,I have read the book and I have the feeling that it is a well orquestrated plan to destroy a very positive force in the Church. Just like when the Jesuits came out many centuries ago. Something tells me that in a couple of decades many of these people will be eating their words and we will see the Catholic Church name this priest Maciel as a true saint. Maybe I'm wrong but there are many similiar cases in the history of the Church. Time will tell.
4,Guess who are the ones who gave it one star?,"It's a darned good book. By way of transparency, I think that the reviewers who gave it one star should self-identify: they are not disinterested, but instead are 'in the circle' of the Legion. You can spot 'em a million miles away."
2,Kindle price almost 2x physical copy price,The price of this book is out of line with Amazon's Kindle ebook pricing policy with the Kindle version almost twice the price of a physical book. Shame on this publisher.
1,"Book, reviews full of distortion","I have scoured Vows of Silence and if you read it carefully you find that its attempt to rewrite history fails with regard to the Legion of Christ and Father Marcial Maciel. The authors use hearsay and inuendo to cast doubt on the entire life and life project of Father Maciel without any hard evidence of anything. In fact, the historical evidence all points to his innocence, as documented at legionaryfacts.org. And the there's the problem with the false reviews posted here. Reviews falsely attributed to faithful members of the Legion of Christ -- Luis Garza and Malen Oriol -- are posted and protected here. Hmm."
1,Disappointing blend of fact and fiction,"There is little new in this book, except a strained attempt to link unrelated events and suggest the Pope is tolerant of child abuse. That attempt is so strained as to deny logic. The authors quote from their own newspaper articles and a group of men who claim they were abused some 50 years ago -- charges dismissed long ago.If you don't like the Holy Father and think the Church should change its views on morality, especially sexual conduct, you will like this book. If you support the Holy Father and the teachings of the Church, this book will be puzzling at best, disgusting at worst.Read the Gospel, go see The Passion of the Christ but don't waste you time on this."
1,"Shoddy Research, Bad Fiction","Berry sounds as if he is writing about a medieval secret society. He is quick to place the blame for the sex scandal on the Church herself, rather than where it belongs, on our amoral society, and widespread acceptance of homosexuality. If the priests who committed these horrible deeds were faithful to the teaching of the Church on chastity, this never would have happened. His research is like that of Cornwall in ""Hitler's Pope"" where he claims to have done much work, though it does not square with the truth. This book is only of interest to those who have already decided the Catholic Church as a whole is at fault here, and I'm afraid this will only increase the efforts of those who make accusations decades later in order to gain financially."
5,"Superb, balanced treatment of Papal and clergy filth","The work speaks for itself. Urbane writing makes the evidence more devestating-- evidence of massive clerical pedophilia, Vatican cover-up, lies and secretiveness as common policy of Karol Woytyla. He is clearly a gross failure as Pontiff of a Church which is simply paying the horrific price of his ""all religions have value"", ""no religion possesses the full truth"" nonsense. I expect more books like ""Vows of Silence"" in the future, if not for a number of decades, until the once lustrous and holy Church is brought to its knees in abject denigration and is lifted up once more-- but only after it has paid the price it must for its lies, filth, slime, and excrescence.I recommend Vows of Silence with a 5 star ranking. It is a must read."
4,Niven Magic,The Warlock stories are some of the most entertaining stories that Larry Niven ever wrote. This is a good collection of good stories. Recommended.
3,The DVD could have been better,"This DVD is a great bargain and convenience in terms of having all three episodes on one DVD. The three-story arc is fabulous, and the acting by Kevin Sorbo and Lucy Lawless and Michael Hurst is excellent. However, the quality of the DVD left me disappointed. I felt it is not quite as sharp as other DVDs I own (though it is still far superior to the VHS version), there are no memorable special features, but most damning is the lack of chapter stops! This means you cannot view any particular scene directly. You can only start at the beginning of each episode, and then you are forced to fast-forward to a particular scene (much like VHS). That ignores one of DVD's best features: instant access. Still, I'm happy I own it, I just wish they had done a better job by including chapter stops (as, for instance, the excellent Avengers DVDs have)."
4,"Great Introduction (Great, However, Followed Elsewhere)","The Xena Trilogy that introduced television viewers everywhere to the warrior princess was a very good three episode arc: it began with Xena, the Manipulative Shrew, in ""The Warrior Princess"" ... it then traveled to Xena, The Divided Conqueror, in ""The Gauntlet,"" as goodness started to find a place in the heroine's heart ... and then introduced us to a true warrior interested in righting her wrongs in ""Unchained Heart.""However, true greatness was to be found when Xena spun off into her own series.Still, these humble beginnings -- part of HERCULES, THE LEGENDARY JOURNEYS -- are well worth the high camp fun that typified both shows storytelling. Lucy Lawless only gets more beautiful with each subsequent viewing."
3,"good episodes, overpriced","These 3 episodes of Hercules the Legendary journeys are available here for one price, but are also available as part of Hercules Season One for a lower price, (plus you get the rest of the season) and you can see the episodes in context. Also Herc season 1 contains 5 tv movies, 3 of which are really quite good. (the 1st is a bit weak and the 5th is a re-hash of the other four) Movie 1 has Lucy Lawless in a non-xena bit part, and Movie 2 has Renee O'Connor in a featured role. So if you get that set you'll get everything you get here, plus a lot more stuff, and it is A LOT CHEAPER."
5,Can't wait to watch,"Had never seen these episodes till recently, and although I'm not as much a fan of Hercules, my whole family loves Xena's show and it's great getting to see her origins."
4,A useful an effective strategy for authentic writing,"Although this book is about two 1st grade teachers' use of family message journals, I am a 3rd grade teacher and still found it very useful. Before reading this book, I sensed that message journals were an effective way to get students to communicate about their learning with their families, but I didn't have any guidelines or research to back to it up. Now I do and am very confident about my decision to use family message journals on a daily basis. If you are looking for a way to integrate content area learning, writing and family communication then I highly recommend this book."
4,Submarine Diary: The Silent Stalking of Japan,Very exciting story. The author was extremely adventerous-more so than I personally would have cared to experience. The book is a great read.
1,This product is the worst!!!!,"This thing does not work at all. If you press hard against the wall, the LED lights up even when there is no stud. Save your $$$$$."
1,No sensitivity,"This stud finder only has one LED. Moving it along the wall will often light up the LED when there is no stud. It is very frustrating. I bought a Stanley Intellisensor 77-110 for ten bucks, which has three red LEDs. When you pass a stud all three LEDs light up, and it makes a noise. The Stanley (and probably many others) work much better than this product."
1,Battleship Sunk! or not...,I purchased this zircon because I was cheap and just wanted something to help me find a stud instead of knocking on the wall and listening to the subtle noises of finding a stud. I met my match trying to listen to find the studs in the ceiling trying to install a hyloft. I would it against the ceiling and hold the button and slide it across. Then the light would illuminate and I assumed I struck gold. A couple of strokes with the hammer and my nail was falling out. I tried it many times and it just wouldnt find a stud. Maybe it found imaginary studs but my ceiling definately has random holes along the top now
4,Great book,This book is my favorite one on Nixon. Ambrose did a great job on explaining Nixon's early years as a child and a young man. I believe that Ambrose gave Nixon a decent and fair treatment in this book. I would highly recommend the book.
5,it's a let down,"It's hard to control the characters, the plots all messed up, it usually too dark too even see where you're going. although the graphics are excellent, I didn't approve of this game at all."
3,IT'S NOT THAT BAD,"What do you mean ""A BIG GLITCH""? Batman & Robin is a mere better than poor! I've looked in a quiz, and two Italian plumbers (Mario and Luigi) both relate to this game. Besides, Mediocre is 10% better than poor."
1,Poor packaging,"Just wanted to agree with some of the other reviewers on this item...first order attempt was returned to amazon by UPS before I even received it due to damage. After they resent a new set, via 2-day express, it arrived in pieces. I was forced to refuse the delivery and now am stuck with getting another gift in very little time as they cannot send again in time for me to receive for my party. Very disappointing...amazon needs to review the packaging of this item...allow plenty of time if you are ordering as a gift."
2,Libbey Cancun Margarita 7-Piece Set,"I'm dissatified, because the way the package glass, one ends up broken every time. But the glasses are nice glasses, and I would buy them in any store. It's a wonderful glass set, glasses are thick and shouldn't be hard to break."
4,great for the price,"This isn't the nicest set you'll find by far. You can see the seem on the pitcher from when it was manufactured. However, if you want a set of margarita glasses and a glass pitcher, this is the best buy you'll find."
