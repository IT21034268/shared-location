5,Fantastic!!!!,"I have enjoyed this lens very much. It is the first new lens for my canon rebel. It is easy to use. The photos are very sharp. The lens is an improvement over the lens that came with the camera--clearer photos, bright colors, not just macro, but regular photos too."
5,very nice lens,"Hiit is very very nice lens. I did some shots for wrist watch adverts. very clear and sharp image. moreover, people thought it is computer rendering."
4,Macro Happy,I am still learning about my new Canon EF-S Macro lens. This is the first Macro lens that I have owned but I took some quick shots to get familiar with it and was very pleased. I would recommend this lens to others.
3,"Not Great but not awful, This CAN come in handy.","I love macro photography and this is the only lens I can actually use up close without it blurring so right there that is essential. The quality on the other hand, isn't the best in my opinion.. I don't know what it is but I have alot of trouble getting a good crisp image compared to my 2 other lenses. You can view my skull image submissions to see what I'm dealing with. Again, this COULD be me.. Sometimes I do have regrets spending so much money, I don't think it's worth the price.. There are some amazing lenses for 400.00 these days and this is not one of them.Decent lens, not awful, not great."
4,Great lens but broke after 5 months,"This is a great lens which produces sharp and colorful images,although it broke after 5 months (~6000 pics) after I shot at f/32.It gives the Err 01 (communication between camera and lens is faulty),which is caused by the aperture malfunction.The lens is still on warranty but not international,which forces me to pay 1/2 of its price for reparation.If I would have to buy another lens I'll choose the same one."
3,Extra $$$ for IS is worth it,"This is a nice, sharp lens. But without IS, it's really pretty hard to take a decent macro shot hand held in anything but the brightest light. The bottom line is that even though the Canon 100mm USM IS is 2.5 times more, it is so much sharper (even though the EF-S 60mm isn't too bad) and, more importantly, you can take a macro photo in the field hand held. So, even though it is not an apples-to-apples comparison, the question comes down to whether your intend to shoot with a macro lens hand held or on a tripod. If you don't mind using a tripod all of the time, then this lens if just fine (and very affordable). But if you plan on taking hand held macro shots, this lens will disappoint and you will spend the extra money to get an IS macro....."
4,Great utility lens for all compositions,"I purchased this lens after waiting for what seemed forever for it's sister lens the 100mm macroCanon EF 100mm f/2.8 Macro USM Lens for Canon SLR Camerasto go on sale and ship through Amazon. I have been wanting a macro lens to add to my collection and had my eyes on the 100mm for some time. Luckily, this 60mm lens went on sale through Amazon and I convinced myself I really didn't need that extra focal length, definitely glad I did.It is great for any type of shot. I love it for portrait shots especially outdoors. The depth of field from the f/2.8 does amazing things for the composition. It definitely has great macro abilities and the less focal length doesn't make a difference if you are not too afraid to get closer to your subject matter.Only draw back I have found with this lens is shooting indoor portrait photography in small spaces. Starting out at 60mm cuts down the amount subject matter you can have in the frame."
5,It's great,Great macro lens. It can take a couple inches away from lens to landscape photography. It works best if you have good lighting like a ring flash / lamp.
5,A great Canon macro lens!,This is a light weight lens that is a pleasure to use whether you're taking photographs of little critters or jewelry!
5,Great Lense,"I have of late gotten back into photography. This lense has opened a new door on possibilities. My grandson and have been exploring the backyard in ""Detail"".I have an assortment of zoom lenses in the bag. This lense forces me back to photographic roots and the old axiom of ""If your Photographs are consistently bad, get closer"". That is now true in more ways than one.Lense is very well built, focuses fast, although I admit I have gone to manual focus for most of the work with it. I did have to break down and get a remote release for the camera and read the book to find the new configuration for Mirror Up on the new 7D which I adore!Good Quality at a Good price.Dave"
5,Leather Duster Value,"This item is fantastic, especially considering the price. I was shocked to feel the weight and see the quality of the garment. For the price I expected a patchwork and flimsy leather garment and recieved instead a high quality duster, definately one of my best buying experiences online.One slight drawback is that if you are buying this for motorcycle riding, be warned that it does not have leg straps. Other than that minor drawback, go for it!"
4,Neurological Differential Diagnosis,"A fast read (for a neurology text, i.e.). Clear and concise writing and explanations. Nice illustrations. Doesn't bog you down with minutia. A great starter book for budding neurologists."
3,It wasn't what I thought.,"I was looking for the song ""How Far Is Heaven"", and the one on this album wasn't what I was looking for.The Jackson Southernaires sing well and with their hearts, but this isn't really the type of musicI enjoy.Thanks for your help and promptness.S"
1,Tiffen 3 filter kit,Product not as represented--filters had been used and some of the black finish on the metal ring was scratched off. Should have been described as used.
2,Returned,Out of the box one of filters had a defect of coating. like a underpainted blob.Thanks Amazon for no hassle return.
1,What a dissapointment!,"I purchased these filter for a simple Nikon 50mm lens. Advertised is that the kit includes UV protector, Neutral density 0.6 and FL-D filter, which is true, but the box says it includes circular polarized filter which is not.The case is horrible and arrived in bad conditions, filter were full of dust and the FL-D filter came with a very big fungus that can't be removed, because it's inside the glass.I think that this is my last purchase of Tiffen filters. Have many others for my 6 lenses, and I have something to tell about each one. Very bad quality. I'll try B&W; and Hoya next time. Save your money and buy something else."
3,I was disappointed with video but pleased with music.,The pace of this video is slow and somewhat plodding. I was sorry I had spent the money on it. Lucky it quickly sold for almost what I paid. It was almost a Baby Einstein in terms of the video quality. I agree that the audio was excellent with good music throughout but it did not keep my 2.5 year old entertained and she enjoys trains and planes very much.
5,I am glad to her shine forth,"Vanessa,Is truly an anointed woman of God. She is so sweet and humble and I praise God for her new project. I have enjoyed her ministering locally in the Washington DC area. I've also had the joy of singing backup with her in a few groups in the area. I know that this album will be a sheer blessing. To God be the glory for the things he has done. Be ready to experience Vanessa and the Holy Spirit as she sings with an anointing like none other."
5,excellant,my friend has this cd and i think that it is just excellant it has really blessed me when i listened to it and there is one song that i really like the most and i just listen to it over and over.thats why i ordered this cd i just had to have it god bless
5,BRING IT BACK!!!,"Just when I find the perfect eyeliner, Palladio, #272 Taupe, they go and discontinue it! PLEASE BRING IT BACK!! This product went on smoothly, wore well, and came off easily. It was a great product!!"
5,Another wonderful project involving Gackt-sama,"Okay, excusing that fact that I am totally biased because Gackt-sama is one of my all-time favorite singers ... I shall review Moonchild. As for what someone else stated, this movie made me cry so much my eyes were bloodred and my family proceeded to tease me about it for the next two days. If you don't cry, you probably dislike Japan/Gackt/HYDE, or are pretty heartless. I thought the relationship between the girl (I can't remember her name) and Shou seemed awfully lame and/or not believeable. Shou and Kei seemed to have the deepest relationship in the whole movie. The movie is definatly one of my all time favorites, and I can't wait to watch it again! Personally I don't think people should review or watch this movie if they aren't a fan of Japan, Gackt or Hyde."
5,O.O,"Gackt and Hyde, what more could you want?! XD two prefect beauties = one great film! Especially if you know Japanese, as I do ^.-"
3,"AN UNBIASED REVIEW..because really, the fangirlie reviews are getting a bit ridiculous","I watched this movie without any idea of who Gackt or Hyde were. [i later came to find out they are some type of japanese rock stars, but that's beside the point]Yes, they are both very pretty, but good looking stars doth not a good film make.In all fairness, i did enjoy the fight scenes, even if they were a bit over the top. But overall, the movie kind of dragged. The story made weird timeline jumps, which left me feeling like i was missing something. Most of the characters are pretty cold also. The only one i actually sort of sympathized with was the vampire, Kei. [which is ironic, because he's not even human] The ending, however, was very well done.But overall i found it hard to follow, and emotionally muddled.So, in my humble opinion,It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't Great"
4,An Interesting Piece,"Moon Child caught my interest simply because it was Gackt and Hyde together. I, being a rather large Gackt fan and a long-time follower of LaRuKu, felt this pairing was a dream come true. What I asked for was a sexy sci-fi vampire romp with plenty of great poses and J-Rocker action, yet what I received was a strong movie of friendship and the search for happiness.The movie starts strong and keeps on going, yet slows down near the middle when their lives start to fall apart. Piece by piece things crumble until the characters manage to sort true happiness from despair and find some order in their lives.I found the movie ot be a little lacking in some parts, and some of the angst seems very Malice Mizer in nature. There's a distinct break in the movie where the plot take a major twist, and it leaves watchers wondering exactly what will happen next. Keep your mind open for this one, folks; it won't go where you expect it to, but at least the ride is fun."
5,"good movie, good subs","This is one of my favorite movies because it's starring gackt AND hyde. And the subbing is pretty good too. Hyde is more of a natural actor than gackt, but they both did a beautiful job if you ask me XD"
4,Liked it,"I changed my dislike to, love it, after I watched the whole movie. It is another 80's style film, which is kinda cool. I've watched it twice now."
4,Great with Book and for Teachers,"This book goes nicely with the video. Together, the two materials are great for the beginner violinist to get started. The video is excellent for visualization of violin introductory concepts/technique. I teach beginner violin, and I use the video and book together for student self-study home assignments, and my student has had great success with these material supplements to reinforce or review material learned during lessons. If teaching yourself violin, I recommend that additional beginner violin books also be purchased to gain a more well-rounded study of violin, however. Mel Bay's First Lessons Violin book makes a very nice addition to the ABC's collection."
5,Excellent DVD for Beginning Violin!,"This DVD along with the ABC's of Violin book 1 was a great way for me to start violin. I learned to read music, tune the violin and play Ode to Joy, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and Mary had a Little Lamb all in a week!It has everything you need if you are a stark beginner like me. I never played another instrument before but learned the music staff on screen, how to hold the violin and bow, pizzicato the strings, play with the bow. The actress who is the author of the book makes things clear and you can play along with her. It is a lot of fun!"
4,"Good info & instruction, but a little disappointed...","This DVD covers some great information for the beginner, and is a MUST HAVE if you're teaching yourself the violin rather than having a personal instructor. However, if you're working with a personal instructor, you probably don't need this DVD unless the recommend it.A word of caution, however: This DVD does NOT cover the Vol. I book. I was under the impression it did... I was hoping it would give us a visual step-through of the Vol. 1 exercises and play the songs (especially the duets in the back of Vol. I. She does play the more popular songs in Book 1 (4 or 5 of them) in the ""Performances"" section, but it doesn't show the music, nor does she have you ""play along with"" her. I guess you have to now buy the Vol. 1 CD in order to get that kind of instruction (ugh, more $$)?"
1,Not worth the money,"The reviews posted are hype, not for real. This is a piece of trash, not worth the packaging it came it. The instructor is straight out of the 30's if you ask, talks soooooooo slow, assumes everyone who's watching here is a complete idiot, and the best part, teaches you ABSOLUTELY nothing about proper violin technique and how to play. I've easily found better lessons free on the web and YouTube than anything found in this DVD. I'm sorry I wasted my money on it. But the marketing hype is really great, sure suckered me into buying it."
3,Her Eyes !,"Nice basic beginning video for those who know nothing about the violin, but I was put off from her never looking at the camera. Kinda creepy as it appears that she is looking over your shoulder and not at you. Get it at your library first before you buy...."
3,Kind of a waste of money,The book is really all that is needed. Unless you are an audio/visual learner - which I usually am but felt I wasted my money buying this. Plus there are youtube videos that are useful...and free...
1,Not much to it,"The DVD program is not a training program. It's a very basic introuction toe the vioin---identify the parts, name the notes, hold the bow. I didn't learn anything that couldn't be found in the first few pages of any introductory book. Very disappointing."
3,Basic Basic Basic BUT good foundation for CHILDREN,"I bought this DVD for my daughter who is six. Violin teachers cost $50 per hour in our area. So this is the best I can get her for right now. Janis Tucker Rhoda is so dull. BUT she does teach you a proper bow hold, how to use the bow, and some BASIC BASIC BASIC notes. I was annoyed because just when you feel like okay we can get somewhere, the DVD ends and she tells you to buy her books. BUT that being said, compared to a youtube video or something you find on the net, Janis is a professional, and she shows you the correct posture etc... So it was great for my six year old.... not so great for grown ups."
3,It's Ok - The Instructor is a Little To Quick,Product is ok but the DVD moves a little too quickly. The instructor is obviously very talented and seems to be a super nice person however sometimes her voice is a little bit too calm and easy which leads to bordem and even putting me slightly to sleep!
2,Short and not that informative,"I would recommend the ABCs books for those wanting a grounding in classical violin but this DVD is a little short on content. Infact, this review may be longer...."
1,A wast of time and money,"It seemed like a good price, but then you have to buy the music book separately, which upped the cost in the end. Take some advice from someone who has tried almost everything, get the AMP- Beginner violin lessons on DVD, it is the only way to really learn how to play the violin!"
2,Poor Quality,"I just bought this CD and ripped it to my PC. When playing back the sound was not up to par. At first I thought it was my PC or sound card, but when I played the CD on another player I got the same results. The instrumental and chorus was too loud and overshadowed the lead singers. I tried an MP3 version from a friends PC and it played perfectly fine. It is pretty sad when an MP3 version sounds far better then a CD version. I have ordered the second volume and hope it doesn't sould like the first volume, if so it will be the last one I order from here."
2,teenage crush,Not too good.quality of sound is fair.song selection is all over the map.I would not buy again
4,it is one of the best cds i have ever listened to,well i like to jam out listening to slow pain but i lost the cd. so i hope yuo guys will restock this item.
3,Not as good as his first album,"If you loved his first album, you may find this sophomore effort a bit of a ho hum. Doesn't have the edge of the first one."
5,"August 7, 2006","I saw James Hunter with Van Morrison last night and am ordering two CDs today -- this guy is fabulous! I can't understand why we're just now hearing about him, given that his first UK release was 10 years ago. He's touring this summer with Van, Susan Tedeschi, Los Lonely Boys and Solomon Burke -- if you get a chance to see him, do yourself a favor and GO! Meanwhile, I can vouch for the CDs, having heard most of the material live."
4,Follow up record,"Not to say this guy isn't good, he is and very smooth too. If you have ""People Gonna Talk"" though, this new offering is like the cuts that missed the first recording."
4,more Dark Shadows fun,"Although the original fascination of seeing my childhood memories spring to life on the screen has somewhat faded, the interesting storyline still has me hooked. What will happen with David? Why is Sam's painting taking such a strange turn? Poor Victoria is uncertain about her past. It's still fun to watch.H. Dougherty"
4,DARK SHADOWS THE BEGINNING VOL 4,"I HAVE THROUGHLY ENJOYED WATCHING ALL THE EARLY DARK SHADOWS VOL'S 1 TO 6 [PRE -BARBABAS] AND THE ONLY COMPLIANT I HAVE IN VOL 4 WAS THAT THEY KILLED OFF DOCTER PETER GUTHRIE TO SOON,I THOUGHT HE WAS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PARTS OF EXPOSING LAURA COLLINS [THE PHONIEX]OTHER THEN THAT VOL 4 WAS EXCELLENT!!!!!"
3,The Pheonix is rising!,"THe Pheonix episodes are some of my favorites of the pre-Barnabus DS. I am not sure if this set will include the final episode of the Pheonix storyline, but that whole plot benefitted greatly by the enormous acting talents of one ten year old actor named David Hennesy. That finale where he runs from the burning cottage and into Victoria's arms, sobbing and screaming---and you realize it was videotaped LIVE and only ONCE! The actors did not have a chance at retakes. And there were several times througout the run of the show when one of the adults messed up (or he messed up) and his quickness on his feet saved the day. Incredible little actor!I would like it if the box sets had more than 4 discs. I think they should double the discs and episodes and add maybe $10 to the price. Or maybe use both sides of the discs. After all there were more than 1,100 episodes of this series. I wonder how many discs it will take to do the whole thing?"
1,For Battlestar completists only,"This book has hardly anything new to offer the hardcore Battlestar Galactica fan containing as it does information that is well known to fandom in general.The sections on the show's ratings and X-Men producer Tom DeSanto's aborted attempt to bring back the show are good but these are let down by the book's poor layout, typos and poor editing (at one point the text starts going into a completetely different sentence fragment on Knight Rider!).Also, it is poorly researched, for instance - more than once producer and creator Glen A. Larson is credited with the show Tales of the Gold Monkey, when in fact co-producer Don Bellisario created it!This book is overpriced and not the definitive book on the original Battlestar Galactica, that is still to be written."
3,Amazon Quality Control Problem,The filters are fine but Amazon sent me a defective filter 58mm and two 55mm filters. They then promised me a postage page envelope to send the defective part back but I have not received either of the two that they said they sent. Now they are threatening to charge me for the defective item because I haven't sent it back yet. I will now pay for the defective shipment back to them and not order from them again.
1,"Received as gift, 1 filter was USED when purchased new!","One of the filters in this was used even though it was supposed to be used. The threads are nearly stripped somehow and if you shake the filter you can hear it rattle. Other two filters were in fantastic shape, it was obvious they were brand new. Extremely disappointed."
2,Not what I Expected!,"Would not buy this item, It`s not what I expected! Did not work well with my camera.."
3,Disappointed with Amazon,The product condition was ok in general ... but arrived without a box (already open and used ) though it said in the initial advertisement that it is NEW!
4,nice starter kit,"it's definitely a great starter kit... but you can take pictures and adjust it on photo programs, so filters are kinda obsolete these days... but not all the time..."
4,UV filter a problem,"Overall I like these filters. I use many Tiffen filters without any issues, but there is one problem with the UV filter. I use these on a Sigma 10-20 mm wide angle zoom lens. Because of the wide angle, the glass protrudes outward from the lens in a bubble. The UV filter, when screwed on actually touches the glass of the lens. The other two filters are recessed enough that they don't touch.Just a warning for folks with wide angle zooms, otherwise a great product. The CP filter is excellent! It really punches up the color and reduces glare on water and glass."
2,Confused picture after using Filter,"With very much excited, I have opened the filter bag and try to put the filter on some of Nikon 18-105 lens. The image of light source never coming correctly. Even the quality of filter appears to be great."
3,Watch out for vignetting,"The filters are great, but the 'circular polarizer' filter causes vignetting in wide angle shooting. The small guide that comes with the lens kit mentions this vignetting -- basically to get you to upgrade to the thinner version of that filter. I just wish Amazon's product description mentioned this downside as well; it's a bit dishonest.Anyways, the two other filters are thinner, and do not cause vignetting. Sweet little filter case too."
3,wrong size sent,"The quality is average, but I was never able to use because like other people who have bought product, they sent wrong size. I purchased a 55mm kit and a 62mm kit was sent"
1,Poor Quality Filters,"The filters that I got are poorly finished. The 812 filter has a smudge on it, while all 3 filters don't screw on properly on my lens. All filters come off EASILY. They are totally useless. I suggest that you buy filters in a real store so you can try them on your lens."
4,Great set of Filters,"This is a great set of filters. I only gave it 4 stars because the filters do not have protection in the container they come in. I would have thought they would each be in a plastic bag inside the container, but they were not. Other than that, the filters are great. Tiffen makes great filters."
2,Tiffen 58mm Photo Filter Kit,"Polorising filter is really not upto the job basically its coloured glass, i have since purchased a new Hoya filter works great..!They are designed for something its just not av worked it out as yet, still working on it..!"
2,Filthy and greasy,"I received these filters covered with fingerprints and greasy smudges that to this day I was unable to clean completely. As other reviewers seem to have had the same issues I suspect this is a Tiffen problem (my package didn't seem used) with poor manufacturing/packaging practices.The filters themselves seem OK, although the UV one creates all sorts of internal reflections with the front element of the lens. The polarizer is of good mechanical quality. Have not used the neutral density much. However, because of the smudges I doubt I'll ever buy a Tiffen filter again."
2,Causes a reflection off of the actual lenses,The polarizer works well but the UV filter causes a reflection of lighted objects to appear. Most of my photos are taken at twilight or at night and this reflection has ruined many a shot.
4,nice filters,"These are good quality filters that work as advertised. I like the warming filter a lot more than I initally thought I would. The price for the kit at the time I bought it was the same as the price as purchasing individually the polarizer (which I really wanted) and the warming filter. In other words, the clear UV filter was a bonus.I did not see any production problem or have any issue with the threads. The only complaint I have was that there was a little styrofoam or dust on each one straight out of the box. This is probably an issue more with my patience than it is with the product. Just clean the filters before you take them out to use them, or bring a reasonable lens cleaner along.The case is more or less useless unless you have a wide camera bag."
4,Great set for the money,"Set arrived BEFORE Amazon said it would! And it is peak Xmas shopping time now. Amazon is great.Only complaint is that two of the filters had finger prints on them . . . but at least that meant someone had done QC at Tiffen before shipping them out. Easy to clean.The case they come in is worth half the price. I store the retaining ring from my Canon S3 in the case when I have the extension tube on with the filter. The 812 warming filter is also great for overcast rainy days. For the price, you can't really do better.Oh, and the polarizer filter did work fine when I checked it against my computer monitor. Thanks to the person that suggested how to check it! Pictures of my Koi are now possible."
2,Two filters don't fit the Canon 24-105 L Series,"The UV and Color filters touch the glass of the lens when screwed onto the lens. Beware that these filters DO NOT fit the Canon 24-105 Lens. I have yet to buy new filters, but I suspect the only ones that will fit are the Canon brand filters."
3,"Just OK, I'd get something else if I had to buy over again",I purchased this as part of a special offer with a new Nikkor 18-200 VR. I set out to just get a UV filter to protect my new lens but found this package deal and decided to take it. I have to honestly say the filters are not of the best quality. The optical characteristics of the UV filter are substandard. It has very bad glare. The polarizer and the color warming filter also glare but its not as noticeable because they actually alter the appearance of the image.I wound up getting another UV filter (B+W) which is awesome. I give this three stars because you do get a lot for your money and most beginners may not notice or care about the optics. If Tiffen could improve the glare on these filters this would be a great deal. Until then if you have the money I'd get something better (Hoya or B+W)
5,Outstanding value,These filters were bought for a Nikon D7000 with 18 to 200 lens. They appear to be optically perfect and well built and a high quality soft case to carry them. The warming filter is just enough to bring out skin tones and take away the blue of cloudy days and the polarizing filter does the usual job of deepening skies and removing glare. I am not sure what to with the third filter other and use it as a lens protector when in salt water or dust circumstances.
2,looks cheap,"There are some scratches around the rings, and dust on the filter surface. I bought brand-new but they looked USED to me.Still, tried them on, didn't see any difference between pic taken with filter and the one without.I returned them the next day."
5,It's an excellant product I've used on other lens sizes.,The UV protector is good indoors with harsh lighting and outdoors as well. I took pictures of my grandson in both settings.The color warming filter enhanced all the photos.
5,Tiffen 58 mm photo essentials kit with UV Protector,This kit is exactly what I was looking for as an accessory to my digital camera. The filters offer a wide range of options for getting that perfect picture. They came well wrapped.
5,Tiffen 67mm lens essential kit,I shopped around for this and finally decided that I would stay with Tiffen. I have 2 other cameras and a wide selection of filters and filter sizes but none went to 67mm on my newest camera purchase.This is a very good set and would recomend it to anyone for a good name brand filter set at a reasonable price.
5,Essential indeed,"I am very pleased with the quality and usefulness of these filters. Not they're great lens protectors, both the circular polarizer and warmth filter works flawlessly, and for such econo-friendly price. Totally worth the money you're contemplating (if you still are at this point) on spending.Polarizer is a permanent lens company for me."
2,Be mindful of your shots,"I have a lens filter tha tis a direct 49mm for my Minolta, & I can only take pix, after extending the lens some. Otherwise, I have the ends of the filter lens in the picture. VERY SAD for a 49 to 49 lens. It ruined some great shots too. Well, not ruined, as in I can't use, but not the full shot either.Just a note about filters, that I have come across. Extend out, & everything is fine. But, can you rember to do that with every shot? Me either.Hope you find this useful, & get some great shots."
1,Stay Away,"I bought these filters for my new efs 17-85mm lens. At best, these filters only protect the lens. Unfortunately, most of the time, the filter degrades the picture; especially on auto-focus. You get what you pay for, and I for one wish I went with a better filter.UPDATE:So far, Hoya Filters I've found to be good, but if you want a really nice filter, then go with B&W;."
1,ASTOUNDINGLY CHEAP! BUY SOMETHING BETTER!!!,"Wow, I was very very very unimpressed with these filters. Not just mediocore, but there was dust on the lenses and you can tell by just holding them they are cheap as sin. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. IF YOU HAVE ANY HOPES OF TAKING AMAZING PICTURES, UPGRADE!!!"
3,Useful for beginners,"You essentially get what you pay for with these filters. The construction is not fantastic but they do the job well. I was dissapointed to find dust particles on 2/3 filters...wheres the Q.C Tiffen?I will use these on my Panasonic FZ-50 until I need a replacement, which won't be this particular set"
1,VERY DISAPOINTED!,"As some of the reviews I read online had said, the package/kit of 3 filters was an overall disappointment. The polarizer was the worst. I have a six dollar pair of polaroid sunglasses I bought at Wallgreen's that remove more reflection off of objects, deepen the skys blue better than this junk. Of course the filter did not even come any where close to a Nikon filter that I've had and used for 25 years. Also as reported from others here the quality of the metal finnish and threads was bad! I sent it all back within a hour of recieving the delivery of the delivery."
5,Tiifen Does good again,I have always love tiffen and they did good again and did it with out breaking the bank and the quality is of a level that you would pay $100+ for each.
5,Works great with all my lenses,"I have used these for the last 4 years and I have no complaints. I have used them with different lenses from Nikon to Tokina. The polarizing filter is definitely my favorite as it gives a nice a balanced photo every time. I use the UV filter on my spare lens. I have to admit I have never really used the color warming filter though, maybe I am a conservative photographer, but that's just me."
4,Tiffen Filter Pak,"The pak was excellent. It was very reasonable in cost, and, although not the fanciest filters you can buy, are good quality and very reasonable."
4,decent for the money,these lenses were decent for the money that you pay. I'm a beginner so i don't have anything profound to say about the filters. The polarizer definitely helps remove glare off of water and reflective objects. Haven't really used the red. I haven't had any problems with scratches or threading problems with any of the filters as some other reviews suggested.
3,I don't know how to rate this item ....,I was supposed to get this with two day shipping from DHL... Five days later and still have not received...Don't be in a hurry to get this or any item shipped by DHL
2,62mm Tiffen filter kit is so-so...,"Very affordable, but that comes with a quality trade-off. The threads are not the greatest and the ""laminated"" filters can have slight manufacturing defects. One of my filters came with a small air trap bubble in it. Its small and near the outer edge. Perhaps tiffen would replace, but since it doesn't affect image quality, I am not to worried about it. If you want a set of filters that you can just throw in your pocket for a walk around then the price is right. If you are very serious about photography, then I'd look elsewhere."
2,"Polarizer - good, U.V.- A bust","Now, I know that the only reason for buying a U.V. filter is to protect your lens, and I was interested in buying a polarizing filter, but I saw this deal here and decided to buy all three. While the polarizing filter works great and the nd is O.K. the U.V. filter creates vignetting. so instead of using it as a U.V. filter - I can only use it as a special effects filter for vignetting.Had I known this proior to my purchase, I would have only bought a U.V. filter and saved myself the aggrevation..."
3,Tiffen 46mm Photo Essentials Filter Kit,"When I used the uv filter with zoom, a circle of black appeared on the borders of the picture. I have not yet tried it for close up or macro shots. Not good."
1,not as advertised,It was advertised as a used circular polarized filter and a uv filter what I got was a used polarized filter and a uv filter I guess you get what you pay for be careful if you order something that is used it may not be the same as the new item
1,Appears to be used not new,The UV filter was scored and all the filters had fingerprints on them. The item was advertised as new.
3,Blue dye coming off Circular Polarizer,Some blue stuff came off the glass when I try to clean it. What does this say about the quality?
5,This is top quality workmanship!,This is top quality workmanship! The carry bag is OK but the filters are excellent. The bag does the job but isn't spectacular. The filters on the other hand are quality. I would only buy Tiffen or the camera manufacturer's filters. Those are much more expensive though. I think the Tiffen's do the job.
4,Functional and good build - not pro level lens but you get what you pay for,"I use these on my Nikkor 18-200mm, and they are well constructed with no defect. The filters achieve the desired results, but these aren't high quality multicoated or extra thin lens for better light emission.Overall I'm happy with the purchase. They were fairly economical for what I needed."
5,Beautiful pics made easy.,"This is a basic pack that everyone should own. The u/v keeps your expensive lenses free of dust and scratches. The polarizer cuts the glare and cuts the washing out of colors caused by bright light. Colors come out deeper and in landscape shots the clouds jump off of my prints. The 812, when used indoors, gives things a softer, more natural look under artificial lighting. And you don't need to be an expert to know when to change filters."
2,Not Great,Bought these for my Nikon D200 about 3 months ago. Never having used Tiffen before I took a chance on a recommendation. Vignetting can be an issue for polarizing filters and the vignetting on this one is the worse I've seen. Build quality of all the filters is really not very good. Going to go back to Hoya's which are much better.
3,Caution: Be careful removing your lens filters.,"I really like the Tiffen 58mm lens filter kit, however, after two days, I cracked one of UV protector lens because I could not get it off the adapter for my Canon SX40. The threads are extremely short. Also, on one other occasion, the polarizing lens fell off while I was trying to take a picture. I guess I didn't have it threaded on enough. Like I say the threads are very sensitive to the touch and the alignment has to be just right."
3,You get what you pay for.,"This is a three filter set that is quite cheap. Unfortunately, it performs that way as well. UV filter is OK, although I am pretty sure it is uncoated. It is quite prone to flare. I guess it protects your front element, if you are concerned about that, but I would take it off if you are shooting into any strong light sources.The polarizing filter is pretty weak. It is also quite prone to flare. Of course, you would hope that with a polarizing filter you aren't shooting directly into the sun, but if you would, you would get some pretty strong flare.I haven't used the warming filter -- don't really see the point when shooting digital, easy enough to do that type of effect in post processing.All in all, if you are compulsive about protecting your front element and want a (albeit weak) polarizing filter, this is probably the deal for you. On the other hand, if you want nice filters, expect to pay for them."
5,Great for the price,"I've been using these filters for about a month and they seem pretty solid and well built. By the way, i'm o hobbyist photographer, so i'm in no way using these for professional results.The UV filter is on permanently and i haven't experienced much discomfort from using it. One thing is it contributes to vignetting when i use a lens hood, but i guess ANY filter would. Simple fix is to put them on in different order (just i don't like to have the lens hood on permanently, and switching them on and off is not my idea of fun).The polarizing filter works well, and the warm filter i haven't used much as of yet. They come in a nice pouch, which i feel could be a tad smaller. But overall it was a good purchase."
5,These are great filters,"I did not know what I had been missing on my photos until I installed these filters on my Nikon D-90 and started using them. They make a great difference in the looks and quality of my photos, especially those made outside. The quality if very good and the carrying case was a plus. I plan on ordering additional Tiffen filters."
3,Very complex but a great romance story.,"This book is very complex and slightly hard to follow simply because it is told by someone and not written in the present. It is also quite violent. It is twisted and morbid but makes a very good story to last a while. Compared to Jane Eyre written by Ms. Bronte's sister, Charlotte, this is a bit dull. In Jane Eyre, the love of the story was more visible while in Wuthering Heights, Cathy falls in love because of money and doesn't show the true feelings she has for Heathclif. All in all, this was an enjoyable book though it could have been much better."
4,A Vietnam story for Everyone!,"Intrigued after hearing the author share some anecdotes recently, I read From Classrooms to Claymores. As a female reader, I never would have imagined picking up (let alone enjoying) a Vietnam-related story. I am not even a big fan of pop-culture war movies! However, being a teacher myself, it was interesting to get a glimpse into the persona of this fantastic storyteller and teacher. His sense of humor and realism hit home and make Vietnam not so much a glorified box office hit, but a story more young people should read. Thank you for your stories Mr. Schneider!"
5,From the classroom to the bush,"Since I went from 23 years in the Army and two combat tours to the middle school classroom, I enjoyed the book. The author did a good job. Good read. Buy it!"
3,Author has got a poor memory,Mr Schneider should have check with member of his old unit before writting this book
5,From Classrooms to Claymores,"This was a most enjoyable account of the author's experiences told in a most unique way. Not often am I able to delve into a book that has such an appeal and attraction that I simply had to read it without stopping. While reading I experienced a wide range of emotions, from anxious or attentitivly cautious one minute and sitting at the edge of the chair to laughing at picturing the involvment of the characters and situations. This is the first war story that I have ever read, and was at first reluctant but since it was recommended to me by a friend, did, and must admit that the way it was written did indeed facinate. I would highly recommend it as a good read, and hope the author in the future continues to write."
2,Syrupy.,"I just bought this book and am VERY disappointed. If you are looking for a more 'meaty' book on astrology, then don't get this one. I found the style to be cutesy and conformist, and when I read that both the authors write for Teen Vogue, it all made perfect sense to me. I'm not exactly sure for which 'women' they were writing this book for, but I'm guessing it's for the reading audience of Cosmopolitan..."
5,Amazing collection of early Joe Simon,"This 24 track CD produced by Ace in 1997 includes all of the tracks record prior to Simon signing with Monument's Sound Stage 7 label. the material was recorded between 1960 and 1965 and were issued on small labels like Hush, Gee Bee, and Irral, as well as being picked up for National distribution on Dot and Vee Jay. Amazingly, 13 of the tracks are in stereo(!), including ""My Adorable One"" which sounded crummy and weird on the Vee Jay boxset.You can divide Simon's career into three sections; the Hush/Duane era (presented here), the Sound Stage 7 period and the Spring period.This is the best sounding and most complete collection of that early period. Worth buying!"
5,Locman Watch,Love my Locman! Ordered the woman's version since these watches tend to be so large. Very happy with it.
5,great product,"This product is great. Easy to install and very stable. My property is on a slope and this is a ""life saver""."
5,ladder stabilizers,The installation was simple and only took about 25 minutes. They adjust to different lengths easily and remain sturdy even when fully extended. I wish that I had purchased these years ago instead of using boards under one leg to plumb the ladder.
5,Great Product!,The Universal Level-Ett is a quality product and I will never own another ladder without them. Rock solid and aint skeared of hilly ground no more! Combine this product with the Werner AC78Qickclick Stabilizer and its unbelievable. I'm not afraid to use a ladder now.
3,"Well made, but not for Fiberglass","This product is well made and looks great. However it will not work with a Werner fiberglass ladder without additional parts or more modification. The ladder has aluminum caps at he bottom of the legs, providing additional strength to the foot mounting. These do not match up with the extension brackets, and would cause the units to be crooked in both horizontal and vertical planes without some additional brackets, plates and machine work. If you're up for it, these will be great. Too bad. I still need adjustable feet to finish painting along the side of my (underwater) house. FWIW, the company did not return phone calls for some support.... Who knows; they may have had some ideas!"
5,I am very pleased,"I was a little concerned that the ladder stabilizer did not look larger (I associate size with strength). But after reading other reviews I decide to buy them. I was very pleased at how strong they are. It took me about 50 minutes to do the install. They attach very firmly, and adjust very easily."
4,Good product,"The levelers are great; just difficult to adjust. That is my only complaint, even after application of lubricant. Your mileage may vary."
1,BAD DVD,"Okinawan Karate Kobudo World Event - dI am turely disappointed with this dvd.First thing that i noticed when i started watching this dvd was that it was taken by a home camcordor. picture and sound quality were not good at all. I was there in Okinawa in 1997 and I competed in this very tournament. I have better footage taken from my own video camcorder. Maybe i should put it on amazon and charge $30.00.I was hoping to see more competition and not so much talking.Well enough said, total waist of money."
1,Nobody Can Be This Stupid,"First of all, the concept of ""gun violence"" is ridiculous. This is the 21st century. What do you expect, tomahawks? Would that perhaps be a more ""moral"" way to kill? The convoluted suppositions presented here on the flimsiest of statistics is mind-boggling. A reasonably intelligent person doing casual research would find much to debunk what is here. Is it any wonder gun-owners are paranoid? I mean, what is the agenda here? It certainly isn't public safety or crime control. If you find yourself sharing the author's concerns, do yourself a favor and find a constructive activity. You'll be happier for it."
4,An excellent statement of the scale of gun violence effects,"As a non-academic, I was initially concerned that I would be lost in the rhetoric of social scientists. However, I found professors Cook & Ludwig's argument clear and concise. I believe that this book provides an excellent introduction into the true scope of the gun violence problem. Furthermore, it patently demonstrates the need for serious discussion, free of political biases, concerning access to these uniquely dangerous devices."
5,YES!,"Just as good as Monsters and Robots! That other reviewer is right- some of this gets repetitive fast, but thats only on 2 tracks! This CD is just too cool. I guarentee that you'll love it from the second (or minute, depenting on if you savor the moment of BucketHead like me) you pop it in your stereo. Personally, I think BucketHead's voice is cool. It sounds, so... uh...well, there's good music! Actually, BucketHead sounds like a sober Kurt Cobain. And you can tell that several tracks were taken from this. Like Danyel is Hills of Eternity on Colma. Sorry for my spelling, I'm listening to it right now. Guess I'll wear this one out soon..."
4,"Weird, but still groovy","OK!! Title of this review isn't the best one. But Species is one of my favorites of Buckethead. There's something really cool about this album. It's not the best Buckethead (Mr. B) record but still I listen it every now and then. Maybe it's Brain. There's lot of really cool rhythmical things in this record. It makes me dance (well actually not, but almost!!). ""Carl Junghole"" is awsome and ""Slapatron"" is just a killer."
3,"Great book, but not for beginners","I bought this book expecting a guide starting at the basics and gradually working up to some advanced stuff. Instead, you are immediately thrown into a pretty complex song and there's hardly anything explaining the simple basics of gypsy jazz to get you acclimated with the genre. It's a great book for advanced guitar players, but certainly not for the beginner/intermediate player."
3,Gypsy gyped,"I found this book to be very thorough for the advanced player. There's enough information to keep you practicing for years. However, the book comes with a CD ( very necessary, in order to hear the proper accents ). The distributer failed to send this with the book. When I contacted Amazon, they blew me off, suggesting I should deal with the distributer instead. The reason we all use Amazon, is to avoid these long winded confrontations. The book is very good, but would have been better if the dist. had not removed the CD."
2,Almost a great deal.,"When I demoed this tool I was impressed by the power but not by the weight, it is a very heavy tool. But what stood out most in my mind was the flimsy cart. Very cheap feeling and can you believe it has pnuematic tires! This to me is complete disrespect for the customer, I would have been happy to pay extra to have solid tires on the cart. Its not just the tires, the wheels have no bearings and are very wobbly and the light guage steel and poor quality welds are a joke, K_MART quality at best.Dont expect the cart to last more than a few months tops.The tool is to heavy to haul without the cart so for me its worthless."
4,WOW - really great,"Just watched it for the first time and WOW! What can I say, except, I reallylearned a lot from this DVD. It showed me how to perform every kata exactlyhow it should be done."
4,A moving read,"This book should be on the reading list of anyone interested in the state of modern medicine, as well as the pathology of the medical mind. It is written from the perspective of a fresh, callow medical student who experiences immediate dissonance with the rigid 'traditions' and growing materialistic attitudes within the medical profession.As a young physician myself who is dismayed at the seeming callousness all around, I cannot help but identify strongly with Dr. Greger's anguish. What it lacks in the mockery of ""The House of God"", it more than makes up in raw pain and misery. I have no qualms in recommending this book to all physicians and nurses, who have at any point in their lives, felt doubts about the morality of their noble profession."
1,Wrong Cable,"They shipped the wrong cable. It wouldn't fit, not even close to fitting. Then blamed the mistake on Amazon. After arguing with the customer support guy about if it's the correct cable for my camera they said they would send another. Who knows what I will receive this time.Canon IFC 300PCU - Camera synchro cable - USB - 4 pin USB Type A (M) - digital camera connector (M) - 5 ft - black"
1,disappointed,"this was supposed to be compatible to my digital camcorder and when i received it i was very very disappointed. this was totally huge, i didn't even have to try to plug it in."
1,Not the right cabel,Was sent a usb to mini usb cable. I ordered a canon cord not a mini usb that I have ten of at home the canon xa 10 uses a special cord if you need a canon cord call canon trust me on this onetook me 30 min on the phone to have canon track down this cord for me
4,An Unbalanced but fun race.,Most people think of the Spiders as working for the Weaver. The truth is they work as all parts of the Triat to correct it. The only confusing thing about them is that their aren't enough rules about how to kill a Spider swarm. This makes them nearly unstoppable and VERY hard to notice when they sneak up behind you. To make things even more unbalanced they can eat a persons brain and take over their body! That really isn't to pretty. All in all this book was well written stressing RPing over Rules.
5,Nikon vs Canon,"These Nikon binoculars are my second pair of IS binoculars. They perform as well, if not better than the Canon IS binoculars they are replacing. The quality is up to the usual high Nikon quality. The reason I choose Nikon over Canon is that my previous Canon binoculars went out of alignment and when I sent them to the official Canon Repair Center for repair, they immediately sent them back with a note that said only ""we are returning these to you unrepaired"". That was it, no explanation or advise, no apology, no help at all. After I finally located an independent, nationally known binocular repair person, he said he has attempted to realign these in the past and Canon does not build in any mechanism by which they can be repaired. Live with a split image or throw them away. Considering the rude treatment I received from Canon, and the unrepairability of the binoculars, I chose to replace them with Nikon."
1,Now I know why this book wasn't reviewed by Booklist,"How sad that someone would go to all this effort to puttogether something that is basically useless. The print on the mapsis too small to read. All but 20 of the 278 pages of maps are in black and white. I thought I'd be getting something that my grandchildren could use as they were coming up through the years. There is always something about having a map that intrigues all of us, and adds a little bit more to our imaginations. When I was a junior high school librarian, I had several books of literary maps. Unfortunately, I don't remember their names. The students just loved them. Save your money on this one."
5,What a time saver,The time this little gems saves me is great. I can square up four corners faster then I can do one with a hand chisel.
3,A small modifacation makes it a 5 star,"Out of the box it's a 3, better than nothing but not that good. The problem is the spring is too long,thus too much tension, when you hit it the body tries to raise because of the spring pressure and you just can get the feel of what the tools doing. The fix is to take the screw & washer off and cut the spring until the cutter is just slightly above the body,(if you buy the tool it will make sense) it is like night & day, I thought it was a piece of junk before but after this minor fix it works like a 5 star tool."
2,Get the made-in-USA version,"It appears to be difficult to find a reasonably sharp corner chisel. The Porter Cable corner chisel is the same generic, Chinese-made corner chisel that everyone sells. Sometimes they're sharp, sometimes they're dull. More than likely, you'll get one somewhere in between.Rather than gamble on getting a sharp Chinese-made corner chisel, why not buy a corner chisel that you can count on to be sharp: the Whiteside 9600 Corner Chisel (WHITESIDE MACHINE 9600 SQUARE CORNER CHISEL W/ 3/8 SQUARE HARDENED STEEL CUTTING BLADE).I went through several Chinese-made corner chisels and butchered many test pieces before I discovered the Whiteside 9600. Although it looks just like the Chinese version, the 9600 is made in the USA by Whiteside Machine Company. It's extremely sharp, costs the same as the Chinese version, and is available on Amazon. Seems like a no-brainer."
5,Why didn't I buy this ten years ago?,"I saw this advertised in a tool catalog ten years ago. I kept thinking I should buy that, it is a good idea, I hang a lot of doors, and that would save time and make my radius jig cuts clean right up. I remember the torment I felt when I would cut a corner off square, too vain to fill it, I made painters come behind me and make me look good. Not any more... I am now perfect with my perfect corner maker. Buy it now don't wait the ten tormentuous years I did."
1,Chiseled by the Chisel,I purchased the Porter Cable Spring Loaded Corner model 42234 and after I attempted to mortise a hinge prep I found that the blade was so dull that it would not be able to cut Balsa Wood. I did find another maker of this type corner chisel on the web made by Templaco Tool Co. in California at a cheaper discount than the Porter Cable. It is very sharp and works great.
2,not too sharp,"This corner chisel is designed well, but unfortunately it is not very well sharpened. It mashes wood fibers instead of cutting them. In the end, I went back to my flat chisel to square out the corners."
5,Strap in and hold on!,"This CD offers a truly stunning recording of a wonderful performance of my favorite work by this composer. Unlike his more showy compositions, the emotions conveyed by this work flow quite smoothly. The Four Symphonic Impressions contain passages of amazing power which build upon a tranquil foundation. The fourth piece, in particular, rises from a calm opening into an unforgettable final climax. Reference Recordings has managed to capture the wide dynamic range of these impressions and package them on a silvery disk that will test the limits of any stereo system."
4,quite good,"I like the performance overall. The only thing I didn't like is the trumpet solo in the second movement of Church Windows. It is supposed to be off stage and this doesn't sound like that, as it does with the Chanos disk."
5,It inspired me to begin chakra meditation.,Simple and inspiring. It has taken me one step forward in my meditation. The title does not reflect the overall content of the book though.
1,Pretty sure this is NOT the 510,Ace Hardware Outlet's site shows no 510s. They will probably send you a 530.
1,"Bad Math, Bad Studies","As a fan of the paranormal and all things spooky, I was hoping for something that showed some sort of objective proof of even the most basic of links to ESP and its derrivitives. Instead, I was merely treated to a psychopathic rambling from a person who seems to set off with an overinvested personal interest in proving the disproven in an ill-concieved quest for fame, recognition or possibly some sort of psychosis. His arguments are poorly stated and the video is basically a long winded rant punctuated by a basement grade production budget.In summary, you are buying the rants of a raving lunatic that he stamps out in his basement using cheap CDR's while presumably wearing a tinfoil hat."
1,Oddly - it didn't fit my Canon Camcorder!,"Unfortunately, this cable was totally useless. Despite the fact that it is labeled for ""all Canon Camcorders"" it did not fit mine!"
1,Caveat Emptor.,"This camera was discontinued by Canon in 2008 and Amazon seems to be the only place in the nation where ""new"" EOS Rebel K2 SLR's with the 28-90 mm lens in stock and listed as new. Canon does not support that view of the situation so you are on your own if problems develop. Happened to me with a used one rated a 9 that had half a dozen or more serious defects. I will get a credit for the camera but am stuck with extra lenses and filters, etc. with no way to get a new camera without defects.Canon no longer plans to ever again produce SLR cameras and seems to be aiming its business away from retail consumers to folks such as sports photographers who can afford those $20,000 lenses. Nikon seems to be the one taking over we the little people. So do be careful."
1,Cheaply Made. Huge Disappointment.,"This camera is cheap. It even feels cheap. The first time we loaded film, it jammed and has never worked since. I have for years bought only Canon products which is why I purchased this replacement for an older Canon Rebel (which I loved) that had dropped and broke. Now I'm so turned off by this poorly manufactured Canon product that I'm looking to replace all of my lenses so that I can find a system that's better made."
5,Great Value!,"My wife and I were concerned about losing memories on a digital camera (how many have you taken, but never printed out?) and wanted a solid 35MM and we definately found it in the Rebel!Takes great pics and easy to use!"
5,good,"works well, takes great pictures, i should have paid attention to the fact that it was a film camera and not a digital. other than that it works great."
4,If You Have met a Nasty Person read this book.,"If you need to learn how to deal with nasty people, destructive personalities,cult figures, and yes sociopaths read this book. This book outlines and goes into great details about the tactic nasty people use called invalidation. Everyone at young age is confronted with invalidation.Personally, I have met and worked with some heavy duty invalidation in the work place and the funeral arrangement conference. Pages 63-65 diagrams on the cycle of invalidation make the book worth the purchase. ""The chapter (4) what do we do about it?"" is most helpful. There are detailed lists about how to handle invalidation. I give the book four stars because the book needs more details and explanations in Chapter 4."
1,Superficial and Pedestrian,"This books lacks depth. The material is written in a pedestrian and superficial manner, and it will not add to your depth of understanding. Save your money."
5,"Okay, you're not crazy after all...you've just been robbed by an ""invalidator""!","An insightful, intelligent, and authoritative read! I feel vindicated reading this page turner and it has opened my eyes on this subject of ""invalidation"". I'm studying psychology and highly recommend this book. It teaches about those cunning, ""nasty people"" who either try to wiggle their way into our lives or may already be in it. It also shows us how we can avoid being just as toxic. It's a vicious cycle, if we allow it to be. I recommend this book for anyone who questions ""why do I feel so frustrated and yucky after talking with this person?"" It may be coming from a friend, co-worker, or someone you've been living with for many years. Invalidation can break our spirits by chipping away at our self-esteem over time. For those of us who feel invalidated, this book will empower....for those of us who invalidate...we will understand why more people give their backside to us by simply walking away!"
4,Great book!,This is a very educational easy to understand book and very well written. I highly recommend this book for those who would like to understand the difficult relationships in their lives.
2,Not well prepared as a book,"As a book, I don't think it is well prepared. A lot of equations can be put into appendix and more descriptions can be done on the underlying physics, modeling approach and the meaning of the algorithms. Others like computation/speed trade off of each approach/algorithm are worthy to be addressed too.Also, I have seen duplicated (almost) paragraphs for expanding a one-dimension solution to n-dimensions that is not necessary to be put into the main body of the book"
2,Equations Galore,"This book contains an abundance of equations, which put me to sleep. I think it would gain a wider audience if it included some real-world applications coupled with matlab example programs. The 259-page book only contains 17-pages of matlab code."
2,Not worthy of use,"They were really cheap so I didn't expect too much to begin with, but with them selling them as ""replacement filters"" I thought there might be a chance in hell they'd be legit...Wrong. They are ancient and none of them look the same. Might make a good prop for a home-made film or something. Definitely a no-go for intended use."
3,Food product for price,Recently bought a Israeli gas mask and it came with a 40 mm filter but in a sealed container to keep new. I was expecting the same one but my 40mm filter came with a top on the filter but in no container.
5,Takes me back,"This Album (CD) is truly one of the hidden gems in the gospel music world. I was in a record store in 1994 and saw this in the $1 bin. I was unfamillair with it but decided to pick it up due to the price. I listened to it in my car and was blown away! I lost this CD in 1996 and I was truly sad. I did get another copy later in 2002 when I was going thru something and without fail, when I put it in the CD player...It took me back. what an annoited piece of work. A must have for any person that needs ""the special one"" to pick you up and minister to you from time to time."
4,A good book,I bought this book and passed the test too. I found this book is very detailed. It helped me in exam and will help also in real world too. It has everythin you need to know for Exchange.
1,Horrible!!!!,"This is book is by far, the worst book that MSPress has ever produced. Generally the MSPress books are pretty good. I have only run into two titles that were poorly written/edited/proof-read. This is one of them, and interestingly enough, the other was also co-authored by Ian McLean. This book is so bad that I will never buy a book with his name on it again."
3,An Unfocused Exchange Reference Book,"This books seems to be written with more focus on the title of each chapter then the actual content of the pages. Exchange newbies will be in awe of the titles, expecting to get a lot of meat.Here's my problem, as a fine example page 11-9 has obvious errors, and a lazy walk-through of setting up an Outlook profile to use RPC over HTTP! They give the opposite answers that MSFT does in their own white papers. How is a test taker supposed to trust this book or even pass a test? RPC over HTTP is one of the MAJOR features that came out with Exchange 2003 (you better believe it will be on the test), and they can't even get that right? It makes me leary of a lot of the other areas in the book.Despite that, there is still a lot of good content to read, which is the case for any 700+ page book. I would say, if you are a Microsoft Systems Admin this is a required book to have for reference. But buyer beware if you are looking for a test guide!"
1,Dreadful Book - Avoid,"I haven't taken the exam yet, so I can't comment on the appropriatness of the book to the exam, but my biggest gripe is the ridiculous number of errors in this book. Even with the official list of errata at http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;830785, I've lost count of the number of additional errors. If you do the exercises and think ""why isn't this working?"", you've hit yet another error. My advice: demand a refund immediately."
1,The Worst Self-Paced Training Kit so far,The only reason to buy this book is to get a evaluation copy of Exchange Server 2003 software. I had Chapter 14 lessons 4 & 5 missing from the book.
1,Very poor!!,"I wouldn't waste your money. I am only on chapter 2 and the mistakes in here are stacking up. Spelling mistakes, incorrect information and questions that say to pick an answer from a to g with the correct answer being h make it far from the ideal book to build your confidence or knowledge."
3,Not so bad,"I got this book with a little over 1.5 years of exchange experience and I know quite a bit but thought i could learn alot more and certify in it. Well this book did help me the 2nd time through reading it. The biggest help really was the practice exams. I took the study exams and learned more that way then with reading. I would recommend this book only to those that actually understand Windows 2003, 2000 and NT both directory structure and network structure. There is alot of networking involved such as firewalls and opening ports. Overall it is a good book."
1,Waste of time,Does everybody think they can write a book nowadays? These two writers didn't even bother to coordinate bethween each other on what they were writing. The whole book is a nonsence. Going after the page count not the quality.
1,Caused me a lot of trouble and headaches,"I used this book to teach a course on Exchange based on someone else's recommendation. I really should have read the reviews here first. That was a terrible idea. There are technical errors, the activities don't work, and there are lots of surprise requirements. The hardware and software requirements listed at the beginning of the book are not all you will need to complete the labs. What a major pain this course was for me to use. I am very sorry that I purchased 15 copies of this book. Don't be fooled by high sales numbers, this product is not worth it."
2,Not exactly a great resource for learning Exchange 2003,"This book doesn't help to learn fast and efficient.Everything in this book is explained in text, which makes learning very, very time-consuming. So many times a little diagram could have been be very helpful in explaining how the various components of such a complex system work together. It's not there. The authors leave it to the reader to reconstruct the diagram from the textual description. Takes time.The book also doesn't have a single table. Up to the reader to reconstruct the tables from the text.Also missing in this book are normal page numbers. Page numbering restarts from 1 at every chapter. Not very handy if you're working with the register.This book is not the best resource for what is was intended: studying Exchange 2003. You might want to complement this book with technical articles that you download and print from the MS website, that will give some diagrams to complement the text."
1,The negative reviews are spot on,"This is without doubt the worst MCSE book I've read. There were no reviews here when I bought it (worse luck!) but I wish there had been - I wouldn't have wasted a month of my life studying it.It is error strewn (major errors, not just typos, only some of which are mentioned in the errata web site), badly written, disorganised, unclear, full of redundant information and it will - as other reviewers have noted - force you to reinstall AD/Exchange every second chapter if you want to do the exercises.I postponed the 70-284 exam twice as I felt I didn't understand the material even after going through the book TWICE.In the end, believe me, the exam wasn't too difficult. Administering Exchange 2K3 isn't difficult either. This book won't convince you of that."
1,In a hurray?,"This text impressed me as the worst technical text I've ever read (I went through 4 years of texts for an BSEE). It's as if the authors were given 3 days to write it, the structure and planning of the presentation is so awful."
3,Don't waste your money on this book,"I am an MCSE MCDBA and MCT. One of the training companies I work for chose to use the self paced study guides from Microsoft Press for their curriculum. (We are transitioning to the new MOAC courses.) While this book doesn't seem to be riddled with as many innacuracies as some of the other books in this series are, the author does a poor job of presenting and explaining the material. In addition the author explains how individual features in Windows Server 2003 work but makes either no attempt or poor attempts to explain the higher level concepts that tie all the features together. Reading this book will not enable you to pass the 70-291 exam, worse yet it will not train you to be an effective systems engeneer.While I have not read the Sybex counterpart for 70-291, I used the Sybex books for studying for my NT4.0 and Windows 2000 certifications and would highly recommend them."
5,A little better than I expected.,I knew this wouldn't be super high quality equipment for the price but I was pleasantly surprised. The large tripod carried the Samsonite name and the bag is nice quality.
5,Outstanding for hikes and overlooks,"If you are driving the coast, this is essential if you want to get out of the car and explore the coast. It tells you every turnoff and hiking trail, with useful facts included. Nicely organized. Also separate ""sidebar"" pages inform you about history, wildlife, etc. This is the perfect companion."
1,Utter waste of money,I am not entirely sure why I ordered this - perhaps some curiosity for a US 10th dan Goju Maestro (?). What a complete and utter waste of money. Urban appears to be on drugs as he 'demonstrates' and explains some Goju kata. If you are looking for something useful buy Higaonna's set of tapes. This is total garbage.
5,fopotball,"I first purchased this book in 1959, when I joined the marine corpsmy mother cleaned out my room. I have looked for it a long timeamazon was the only place I have been able to find it."
2,Something to check before buying,"I bought this adapter so as to be able to connect USB devices to a micro-USB cable which I have. However, the adapter will not work if connected to a micro-USB cable -- it must be connected to a cable which also has regular (""A"") USB at the other end."
1,What happened to my negative feedback I posted about this item and seller?,What happened to my negative feedback I posted about this item and seller? I better see it back up on amazon or get a good explanation as to why it isn't there or I'm screaming to Amazon and or the Press or the World if I have to! You are NOT selling what you are advertising and I've got pictures and video to prove it!
2,very disappointing,"This is boring, there is no theme, there are no highs and lows and the cd just aimlessly meanders.I have seen Calexico on Austin City Limits and one of the late night talk shows (Leno? Letterman? Conan?). They were fascinating both visually and sonically. I have several live downloads and they put on a cool show. I made my own compilation and the disc is awesome.This cd just does not do it for me. There are no bad songs on it but...there is hardly anything exciting, nothing really knocks my socks off.This may be one of those bands that need to be experienced live rather than through the studio.This hardly resembles the totally cool band I saw perform on Austin City Limits"
3,"good music, but empty","In the beginning I found it brilliant, it was like a Quentin Tarantino's movie soundtrack, but after some more listenings, it revealed to have too 'easy' sounds and not a real good track. The instrumental bits are still ok, but the songs are not very significant. A bit boring, because you feel it is 'empty', with no soul. Anyway I don't feel to say it's a bad CD."
5,"IMO, the best album of the '90s!","From the moment I heard the first notes of Calexico's ""The Black Light"", I was hooked. It replaced Swell's ""41"" as my favorite album of the 1990s. Desert film-noir soundtrack music at its best (and way better than FODM!). Dark, brooding, and introspective, yet thematic, inspirational, and haunting. A must listen for fans of Cormac McCarthy's epic book ""Blood Meridian"". Imagine being lost in a dusty town of ill repute, asking an old drifter for directions, and he says ""follow her hands, to the dark end of the street..."" Also, one question for the Calexico faithful, does anyone know if their new album ""Tete a tete"" really coming out Jan. 25th? CMJ says April. Quarterstick Records will release ""Descamino"" on Jan. 18th, which includes remixes of ""The Black Light""."
5,The best album I've heard for a long time,"Alternative country in its best!Calexico made a damn good album. The music includes western, Mexican and gipsy themes, and combines them well with humor and grace.A ""must have"" for every music lover."
4,white boys go south,"this CD is totally cool and evocative of many things. It makes me nostalgic for things I've never experienced. There are a lot of good melodies on this disc, most of which are minor keyed and thus, all the more beautiful. If you like surf guitar and lo-fi type stuff, this might be something you can dig. Hell, who knew I'd ever like a CD with elements of mariachi in it? It all makes me wanna smoke, which I don't do anymore."
4,The sun slowly sank down on a hot summer night...,"The sun slowly sank down on a hot summer night, and two strangers pushed open the door to the saloon. In they walked, brushing the dust from their clothes. They'd been riding a long time.Their names were Ennio Morricone and Herb Alpert.They barked at the barman for beer and drank it thirstily when it arrived, staring into each other's eyes. The beer was followed by another, then another, then another. When the beer was gone, they started on tequila. They sat and drank until the bottle was dry and dawn was arriving.""Gonna have to ask you boys to leave,"" said the bartender, and the two men made their way unsteadily to their feet.""Before you go, though...have a look at this.""He pitched them a battered CD case from behind the bar.CALEXICO: THE BLACK LIGHTHerb slapped his friend on the shoulder as they made their way out into the purple dawn.""Ennio, my old compadre, this looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship...."""
5,Tom Waits meets Sergio Leone,"I keep listening to this CD over and over. It's a little weird, but really, really good. The songs are just little atmospheric stories, all with a tex-mex style that's really interesting. It really sets a mood and takes you into a really cool frame of mind. I also put it on just in the background at work sometimes when I want to chill out.The style is sort of like a less angular Tom Waits, but with a strong Mexican influence. I hear that the band is from Arizona somewhere, which makes sense, because lots of the songs have this 60's western movie feel. It's sort of hard to describe, but it's really good."
5,Let The Truth About The Ninja Be Known!,"This is one of the best Ninja books I've read! Kirtland Peterson describes in depth why the public still views ninjas as violent, deadly, assassins. He describes other various ninja stereotypes. There is a lot of ninja history in this book. Kirtland refers to Masaaki Hatsumi, Stephen K. Hayes, Jack E. Hoban, Bud Malmstrom, Glenn J. Morris, and Christopher Hunter/Ashida Kim. Stephen Hayes does a excellent foreword in this book. I won't spoil the rest of book for you. If you like this book, I suggest reading anything by Masaaki Hatsumi, Stephen K. Hayes, Jack E. Hoban, Doron Navon, Glenn J. Morris, Charles Daniels, Bud Malmstrom and Richard Van Donk"
3,Another prespective,"This book is another prespective on that multi-faceted art ninjutsu. It gives the reader more insight into the art, especially the perception of ninjutsu by the masses. I did however find the book in the later chapters to be slightly long winded and containing too much psycho-babble. The book was published in 1986, I wonder if the author is still training. If anyone knows please email me.Overall I found the book to be the authors psychological interpretation of the art of the ninja and its place in society. As such I consider it one man's personal view of the art."
1,YET ANOTHER ODE TO GOD HAYES,"It is obvious the author of this book is yet another worshipper of the great GOD Stephen Hayes, after all if he said it, it is gospel. Why do you think these types of books are written against other Masters and types of Ninjutsu? Because they are scared of losing their business, after all, if there is competition, they lose funds. I have read some of the books they take shots at in this book, and not in any of those books do they take shots at Stephen K. Hayes or any other ""Ninja Masters."" Face it, folks, Ninjutsu was created for one purpose, ""survival."" It is not a ""poetic"" art or a religion, why do people regard it as such?"
4,"It's about the process, not the product","While this book references a specific defect tracking solution, namely FogBugz, you should read more about the process rather than the specific product. You can apply the same process principles to other defect tracking solutions.Speaking of FogBugz (I was responsible for selecting it for our software development company), it's NOT the only good defect tracking software out there. It's good, otherwise I wouldn't have chosen it, but it's far from mature. All you have to witness is the bug reports and feature requests on its own support forum:http://support.fogcreek.com/?fogbugzIn some areas FogBugz does it better than other software. In some other areas it does worse. You will have to do you own research and pick the software that works the best for your own needs."
3,nice but impractical,"The book is very nice and contain interesting information. However, it is very hard to find what you want. The organization of the book is bad. I expected something like a reference book for writing errors, however it is more like a novel you're supposed to read from the beginning to end."
2,"Not good for reference, or for non-cat people","As a technical writer, I am on the lookout for books I can recommend to engineers and others with whom I work who want to improve their writing. This book's explicit orientation toward ""computer people"" and the concept of ""debugging"" prose make it seem like a good candidate. However, the author's self-indulgence in cuteness in this book renders it inappropriate for me to recommend in a professional context.If you don't mind all the cat pictures and personal references, it is a good book to browse for tips on improving your writing. Dupre states that her goal is to help the reader develop an ""ear"" for good writing. As you develop an ear, you will gain a sense of which of her rules to take to heart, and which to take with a grain of salt. It is *not* organized or indexed such that you can easily find a topic again. Do not expect to use it as a reference book when you have finished browsing."
4,Still waiting for Rice to write something I can't use.,"I'm happy to say that I've never been disappointed with anything I've read by Wayne Rice, and he's keeping his record with me intact here. Lots of good ideas. Of course, not everything works for every group, the large group games I'm sure are good, but I'll have to wait till camp this summer to try them out. Overall, another great resource for youth leaders."
4,Still waiting for Rice to write something I can't use.,"I'm happy to say that I've never been disappointed with anything I've read by Wayne Rice, and he's keeping his record with me intact here. Lots of good ideas. Of course, not everything works for every group, not every idea applies to every group. Overall, another great resource for youth leaders."
4,A nice movie for an evening at home,"This movie won't change your life, but it will help you spend a nice time... I really enjoyed AB's acting here and the topics is treated in a light and teneder way...It has not much of singing and dancing and to me this is not a bad thing, anyway I really liked the theme song."
1,Flimsey piece of crap,"Worst tool i ever bought, almost falls apart as you plane the door, racks so far out of square that the sharp corners dug into door. Whole thing is made out of cheap aluminum angle stock and rivets. does not stay in the open postion as it cant hold it's own weight. I threw whole thing in the trash and spent the couple extra dollars for the Denpo door holder."
5,Great product for hold door.,I was amazed to how well the holder held the door while I worked on it.
4,"A little too explicit for my taste, but good nonetheless...","All three stories were fantastic, but I mean damn! The events described, which seemed at times rapid fire one after another, were extremely graphic. I know for sure I would throw up if I saw what she wrote in person. I am looking forward to reading some more of Nancy Collins' work. Midnight Blue definitely got me hooked!"
1,Very disappointing,"I can see I'm probably in the minority here among reviewers, but I could not get into this book. The characters seemed very unappealing to me, the plotting weak, and whoever did the editting on this volume should probably be fired for all the mistakes I spotted with paragraphs that should have been in italics but weren't, or that changed back and forth in the middle of a word. Overall, reading this book left me feeling bored."
3,Unexpected writing--gory details,"Not all vampire fanatics will sink their teeth into Sonja Blue. There isn't any romanticism attached to her lifestyle, there is no secret Brad Pitt with fangs fantasy world. Instead, Sonja Blue is the predator of vampires. She hunts people down, she rips them apart with her super-human strength, and then leaves them eviscerated on the floor. The tale is graphic enough to make my stomach turn.The writing is well-done and unexpected. The author isn't afraid to kill off your favorite characters at inopertune times, because Sonja knows little loyalty or humanity. This book fleshes out her origins and offers insight into the minds of the older vampires.Overall, it wasn't what I wanted. I was looking for romance, I was looking for scenes of beauty instead of constant scenes of painful death. I wanted a story of a human who became a vampire, not a human who became a monster."
5,Sonja rocks!!!,"Sonja Blue is a tough, no-nonsense chick. She is a incredibly strong half-vampire--who slays other vampires. Her human side is Denise Thorne, and her demon side is the Other. Her one goal--one burning revenge--is to kill her maker, the powerful Lord Morgan, who had raped young Denise and left her naked and dying on a crummy London street in 1969. Along the path of her extraordinary story, readers meet unique characters, such as Chaz, her cocky London ex-boyfriend and druggie; Catherine Wheele, a religious fanatic; Pangloss, Morgan's creator and Sonja's ""grandfather""; Palmer, a detective-turned felonist-turned Sonja's boyfriend; and Lethe, the beautiful, mysterious vampire hybrid who calls her ""Auntie Blue."" I just wish that Ms. Collins could continue writing about the escapades of Sonja Blue."
5,Couldn't Put it Down!,"I bought the book a while back and have read the book so many times I think the book's falling apart on me! When I pick it up, Sonja Blue reaches out from the pages, grabs your throat, and doesn't let go! To me, it was one of the most facinating books I've read in a long time. Looking forward to getting the rest of them."
3,Read it if you're bored and have nothing else in mind.,"Maybee I'm not the most fair critic in the world when it comes to vampire literature, but this could have used some work. The high dose of action was good, along with some bits and pieces of clever originality. Unfortunately, the majority of The Sonja Blue collection seemed to be a big fat cliche of mixed up movies and comics. Actually, this probably would have been better if it was a comic. Vertigo could probably give Sonja some justice."
4,Enjoyed it qute a bit...,"It's funny. I received the hardcover because a friend was reading it and found it to be too violent. She went on to write a cycle of short stories that were even more violent in some ways.It's well written stuff, Ms. Collins writes powerfully, and yet it's easy to spend a night reading it. Some absolutely gorgeous turns of phrase or ideas here and there, and some really dorky passages as well.If you like intrigue mixed with fairly graphic horror (note the order I listed them in) then you will love this collection.Personally, I enjoyed it."
5,Sonja Blue kicks ass,"I'm no fan of fantastic tales of blood sucking vampires, but Nancy Collins has done such a fantastic job of weaving the Sonja Blue mystique that I was compelled to read each installment of the quartet. With each subsequent novel Sonja delves into her past and determines not only who she is, but what she is and has become. It's a great read on a rainy day, or even a not so rainy day."
5,Easily the best,Sonja Blue. The name sends shivers up my spine. This is THE BEST book I have ever read. Forget all about Anne Rice. This books got all that vampires truly are. This book made the punk vampire genre what it is today. I have read this book well over twelve times. I am on my thirteenth time and I am not yet tired of it. I have read it so many times the book has all but disentigrated. I highly suggest it to anyone who reads.
5,I could not put it down.,"I have read many collections before,but this one is great!. I Had a hard time putting it down. I felt while reading this book,Sonja was a friend. And the realationship between her and Palmer was wonderful. I am looking forward to reading more of Nancy A. Collins work."
5,One of the most fasinating novels of all time!!!!!,"I love this book. I bought it a month ago and have read it 3 times it never loses its charm I've also read ""A Dozen Black Roses"" and I can't wait for another book to come out!!!!!"
2,Be careful,This is NOT one of Lola Beltran's finest performances. She only comes out 1 time in a cameo appearance and sings one song. I am a huge fan of Lola Beltran and this is totally marketed wrong. It was a deceptive cover (using a beautiful picture of Lola) and the movie only showed her 1 time. I was very bummed out. Happy I got to see her at least sing one song. But the movie is very boring.
5,"canciones de mi padre, a romantic evening in old mexico","it has to be one of the finest productions of hispanic music Ive ever seen, Iam very grateful for it and its availability to the public. a thousand times, thank you.... dahlia from renton wa."
1,The CD did not work,I gave this cd a 1 star out of 5 because the cd did not work. It would not play. Hopefully the replacement is better!
2,LInda RondstadtL Canciones de Mi Padre,thought I ordered a CD....wanted it for the car...was I wrong? Unlikely I'll be playing it on tv...
3,A bit of a disappointment,"For one who fondly remembers Linda Ronstadt's `Blue Bayou' on the Muppet Show (not to mention her wonderful Pirates of the Penzance), this performance-though colorfully energetic-is a bit of a disappointment. It seemed to me something of the aspiring restaurant's Spanish platter-where the enchilada and chili relleno (though individually tasty and attractively presented) are so flavored by the ubiquitous red sauce that they soon become indistinguishable. But admittedly, I don't have a discriminating ear for Mexican folk music."
5,A Fabulous Concert Comes to DVD!!,Linda Ronstadt's amazing tribute to the music of her father finally comes to DVD. Not only is the show visually dazzling; but her voice couldn't be more beautiful. And the dancing and the sets and Danny Valdez!!! I saw the tour live years ago and am very impressed how well the show has been captured on film. You have never seen a show like this before!In reading reviews about Linda Ronstadt's work I am always surprised when people try to lock her into one era or style. Nowadays when its said a recording artist has reinvented themself.. it usually means they have colored their hair or changed their clothing.With Linda Ronstadt you hear not only her talent but her attention to style and detail. Her phrasing and delivery are so authentic you would think she was from another time or place. What an intelligent and fascinating musical career this woman has had (and has)!!! Her talent and continuous commitment to craft inspires and humbles the rest.
3,PRINTING QUALITY SHOUD be reviewed,"I bought this book along with Coltman's. Unfortunately, this book layout is boring, lots of printing mistakes. I am not happy at all with this book."
3,Interesting but not what I expected,If you like simple list of what was going on at Jefferson's estates then you'll like this one. It is interesting to wonder how detailed Jefferson was.
2,really???,"If you want to read page after page (too many to count) of how many blankets this slave got and how much food that slave got, it's a great read and you can buy my copy. If you're looking for something a little more informational on the how the gardens were grown at Monticello try another book like Jefferson's Garden by Loewer which is actually readable."
3,Dion's Gospel Music 1980-1986,"These gospel songs were recorded by Dion from about 1980 through 1986. These songs do not have the doo-wop flavor typical of his early sixties hits. I do have a CD of Dion's early sixties hits that contain a couple of gospel songs with this doo-wop sound, and I really liked these. I ""thought"" this was what I was getting with this CD, so I was a little disappointed. However, if you like normal gospel music and you like Dion, you probably won't be disappointed.Note: The sound quality is typical for a CD with one unusual exception. Track 14 starts out being recorded off a vinyl record. Incredulously, you hear the needle land on the record, then a couple of seconds of scratchy vinyl before the track starts playing. However, a few seconds later it no longer sounds like it is being recorded off an LP but now sounds like a typical CD quality recording. Careful listening at the end of the track also proves it is no longer from an LP. Go Figure."
5,Excellent tool,"I had 15 interior doors to custom finish and install. Never done it before. Besides the usual learning curve, these bits made the hinging process nice...the coup de grace! Make sure you are mindful of the size of screw you are using...and get the correct size Vix-bit."
5,i have the original,"Mine is from the tv show and the Entertainment Weekly photo shoot. It's super comfortable, it hangs well on the shoulders, and it doesn't lose its look or shape when washed."
1,DO NOT BUY! WARNING!,"I bought this for my 2 dogs, gave as directed 1 dog worked fine, other dog is deathly ill. My vet and I are doing everything possible to save his life. 2 hours after giving to 2nd dog noticed he was lethargic, next I noticed he was having loud gurgling noises from his intestines, then muscle spams, shaking, vomiting, no appetite, refuses to drink. Its been 2 days now and have him on IV fluids and has been a HUGE costly mistake buying this product. If you love your pet don't risk it. Buying this product has been a costly mistake and may cost me the life one of my little guys. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!"
5,Better than grease,"This product works great for my daughters hair it holds their ponytails in place, gives hair shine and doesn't make hair greasy."
2,Typical conditioner,"There is nothing special with this as opposed to other moisturizing conditioners. It leaves the same results as a store-bought bottle, softness, etc., but is not much more than that. Will not repair damaged hair, just acts like any other conditioner. Don't waste your money if you have dry, damaged, frizzy hair. Doesn't work."
5,AMAZING!,"omg it really works! I felt difference right when i was putting it on and washing it off! my hair felt so very smooth! I tried a lot of hair products and they all were just the same, didnt do much to my hair, but this one really does what it promises.I have thin but curly hair and i dye it blond, so it is kinda dry and frizzy. It doesnt make wonders and i need to put some other products on my hair after shower, like stay-on conditioner and hairsilk, because my hair is very lightweight and i look like blowball if i dont use those."
2,Okay ...,"I have rough, wavy long hair. I bought this expecting ""soft and silky"" hair after reading many reviews. In that aspect, I'm disappointed. Plus, it is e.x.p.e.n.s.i.v.e.But overall, it is a good conditioner. My hair feels better than before but I still can't get rid of frizz. My hair is still a little dry after washing but more manageable. I guess it's not meant to do magic on my rough and voluminous hair."
1,Runny....not thick..no good.,This is supposed to be really thick and it is very runny. Not happy and will not purchase this again on line.
1,Pantene at 10x the price,"I heard good things about this product so was excited to try it out. For a conditioner that cost 10x as much as the store bought brand, I really expected better results. My hair is abit wavy and thick and usually gets abit frizzy on rainy days and the first day of shampooing. Well, after shampooing and even blow drying it so it's just abit damp, my hair looks the same after it's completely dry. This product is no better than the Pantene conditioner I use on a regular basis.I'm really disappointed and will continue to use it because it does smell good and it was so expensive (won't want to waste it)! But after this jar is used up I will not buy again."
1,possibly the worse judo film available,"This is with out doubt the worse judo film it has ever been my misfortune to own. It claims Kano is shown performing kata, this is correct but the entire time Kano is seen on this footage is no more than 30 to 40 seconds. The rest of the video is taken up with still shots of recycled photographs and lousy video. Take my advice and give this one a wide berth."
5,"Perfect, Great Price",Worked perfect in dowloading video from Canon camcorder to computer which had 4pin firewire input. This was $30.00 at office store.
2,iincorrect fit,This was sold as a cable to fit the cannon camcorder however it has the wrong end for the camera--- WONT FIT--- my camera is an fs 200 as the cost is low its not worth returning with shipping and all w Toepper.
2,looks nice,"Nice and compact, but it did not work. It would not go above 11 lbs which is useless when recovering refrigerant. Product claims it will read between 0 and 110lbs but it didn't, returning the item to Amazon for a refund."
1,Unit was not inspected,Bought unit brand new half to move battery wiring around for unit to work every time threw out boxes or i send it back. and buy LOCAL.
4,Can't wait,I can't wait till i get to break this puppy out and start using it. It seems to be good quality and fairly cheap.
5,Good unit,I was skeptical because of the price. It was indeed a new unit and it works very well. I am pleased with the purchase and the performance of the product. Shipping was reasonable.
4,Good ladder ...,I like the fact that it doesn't take much room to store. Make sure the latchs are in place before stepping on it.
4,Great Ladder but Watch your fingers when you bring it down,We use this ladder every day in our warehouse but watch those fingers when you bring it down. It can come down very fast...ouch. It is nice and small and when I have it extended all the way up I feel safe going up it all the way to the top. I of course have a person folding it just to be safe but would think it is just as safe without a spotter.
5,"Old School, but a superior picture!","As stated in the other reviews, it's VERY HEAVY and takes up a LOT of space! I put mine in a wide (6 foot opening) closet. The kind with 2 sets of bi-fold doors. It took up just over half of the opening (width) and all of the depth on one side of the closet. I wasn't using the closet for much anyway. All that being said, it was worth it! The HD picture (mine is via Dish Network) is the BEST. I had the tv for a very long time before I took advantage of HD, but after getting it, the picture is ASTOUNDING! CRT rules as far as picture quality is concerned. If you can find one (even used) and you have a strong back and the room for it, BUY IT!"
5,Get one while you still can!,"This excellent TV can still be found at a great discount if you look for floor display models at the smaller independent electronics shops.The picture quality is first-rate, and it does not vary as you view it from different angles. If you have a smaller room, and can find space for it, the wide viewing angle lets you sit anywhere and still see the full color and brightness of the screen."
1,DEATH of a TV,"Length:: 1:30 MinsMy Sony also died today, on NFL playoff Sunday... this really sucks this is the second death... It also died in 2008 and the warranty was no good because Good Guys went out of business. It cost over 300 bucks to repair. The repair man said Sony are the best product on the market, but when you get a bad one it's just bad. Since it's worth only 500 bucks now I'll guess I'll be at Best Buy checking out the latest TV's.The picture is awesome when it works..."
4,Rick Try's It Decca's Way,"I had both of these alblblums on vinyl when they came out in 1963. I remember as a young teenager how different these recordings were from Rick's Imperial releases. Rick's very small output in 1962 (he recorded only 5 songs the entire year) was a question mark for me. Was it because of the lack of material or the bad relationship that his Dad had with the owner of Imperial Records? In any event I think these 2 LP's that make up the CD show an experimentation stage of his career.""For Your Sweet Love is probably the best alblum Rick made during the 1963-1969 Decca era. ""For You"" feels like a definite swing towards a more ""country feel"" mixed with those old standards. In any event, Decca was calling the shots here with that 20 year contract they had signed Rick to."
2,Low On Laughs,"For completists only-- but we are legion. Aside from the short about the zoo, the laffs were few and far between. They don't all have to be ROFLers but c'mon guys, people are paying money to watch these... Maybe scale back the number of releases and work a little more magic on what you are putting out."
2,Made in China with Nikon's name on it.,"I have the 20-60X80mm. The optics are OK but the hardware sucks. My eye piece has come loose and the front lens cap broke.I bought a bushnell for less money that came with a tripod, hard case and soft case for less money and I think the quality is better."
5,Excellent map,This was a great map. It showed all the information that one needs to travel about the city. The subways and museums are well marked. The only information that it did not contain was the bus routes. One can get almost anyplace in the city by bus and it is incredibly inexpensive (30 cents) but it is difficult to find bus route maps.
1,Horrible Quality!,"The first 8 I tried to use broke! Horrible Quality - thin, brittle and made in china. They are being returned to Amazon"
4,"A great practical, useable text for argumentation","After teaching a college-level argumentation course for eight years from a traditional text, student comments and my own motivations led me to search for a text that focused on the variety of forms of argument we hear daily. In ""everything's an argument"" I found this text. Teaching the argumentation around the question ""Is everything and argument?"" is a fresh idea that promotes our constant critical thinking as we look for arguments around us. This book provides a variety of excellent examples to illustrate how argument does appear in virtually every aspect of our lives. Exercises at the back of the chapters lead students to analyze arguments they find. I am adopting this text, with some supplementary readings on debate and dialogue, for my Fall 2000 argumentation course. Thank you for a practical, easy-to-read text."
3,Inexpensive rhetoric needs more readings,"Everything's An Argument is based on Aristotelian methods of examining the writer's assumptions. It focuses a lot on the needs of the audience and sticks to the traditional modes of composition. The text itself is very ""readable,"" but the frequent use of quotes excerpted without much context can be frustrating. Very skimpy on readings (thus its affordability). Would work well as a rhetoric with your own course pack, but, on its own, is easily outdone by the many rhetoric/reader combinations available."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!,"Bought this housing new in November 2005.In April I used it for the first time and it flooded on the first dive! Neither Amazon (since it is ouside the 30 day return policy) nor Canon will stand behind this product! Period! I got so much run around from Canon it was ridiculous. They wanted to ""evaluate"" the housing to determine if it was defective...DAH? They WOULD NOT tell me if I sent it back for the ""evaluation"" what the final resolution would be (refund, rework etc).Coincidentally, another person on the same trip had the same housing...it flooded on their first dive too!!!!Coincidence? No. Just terrible quality control and NO product support from Canon. DO NOT BUY CANON PRODUCTS!!!"
4,Nice underwater case,The case held up good untill I took it to 90 foot it then allowed a little leakage of moisture but if your not going deepier than that I highly recommend this product..
3,Okay...,"Here is my review for TH VOL.2:1.B- The original version is better2.A+ Awesome Outkast song!3.A Awesome Twista song!4.B+ Nice song5.D- Horrible6.D- Yuck7.D+ More junk8.C+ Better lyrics would get this song a B+9.A Good rap song10.A+ AWESOME!11.A getting better...12.F- The rest are the same.Lets see the results: A+=2 A=3 B+=1 B-=1 C+=1 D+=1 D-=2 F-=96 songs are awesome, but NOW 17 is better.Good Artists:Outkast, Brandy, Kayne West, Twista, Kevin Lyttle, T.I., Alicia Keys, and CassidyBad Artists:The Rest"
1,Here They Go AGAIN,"Various Arists have to be one of the most overrated bands around. I mean make up your mind guys, what are you, rap, pop, rock? All good bands stick to one thing, Various Artists are a real schizo band.And why do they keep naming the albums Now, and Totally Hits. What about Led Zep style: Various Artists II, III, IV, V etcI am no longer a fan of Various Artists, big letdown."
2,"Awful, but better than TH 2005","TH, you could've done better. Only good artists are Mis-Teeq, Ryan Cabrera, The Darkness, Alanis Morisette, and Jet. I guess I'll give it 2-stars. I guess I'm generous.And since people are complaining about Ciara and Willa Ford, I'll add to it. Willa Ford Sucks, and Ciara is so-so.So, there you go. Run to the CD store and get a copy of the new Natasha Bedingfield album."
3,The Sorry CD Of Summer 2004!!!!!,"Im not a big fan of the totally hits cd series, because all the songs that they put on every totally hits cd are over play'd.This cd was alright, but it some songs that should of been in totally hits 2004 vo.1.This is my prediction for Totally Hits 2005 vol.11.TI:Bring Em Out2.Trick Daddy feat.Twista and Lil Jon:Let's Go3.Alicia keys:karma4.Mario:Let Me Love You5.Fabolous:Breathe6.Lil Jon and The Eastside Boyz feat. Lil Scrappy:What u Gon Do7.Maroon 5:She Will Be Loved8.Avril Lavinge:My Happy Ending9.Davin Degraw:I Dont Want to BEThat's all i got since im not a big fan of Totally Hits series.P.S. Totally Hits cd really SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I think The ""NOW THAT'S WHAT I CALL MUSIC"" SERIES IS BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,"Real Tracklist, from the Totally Hits website at least","1. Turn Me On -- Kevin Lyttle and Spragga Benz2. Roses -- Outkast3. Overnight Celebrity -- Twista4. If I Aint Got You -- Alicia Keys5. On the Way Down -- Ryan Cabrera6. This Love -- Maroon 57. Don't Tell Me -- Avril Lavigne8. Scandalous -- Mis-Teeq9. Let's Get Away -- T.I.10. Talk About Our Love -- Brandy and Kanye West11.

It's 5 O'Clock Somewhere -- Alan Jackson and Jimmy BuffetThis is the tracklist I got off of their website, if the actual tracklist is different than this, I can fix it later today when I pick up the CD."
3,Just a few things before this argument ends,"1) The Willa Has No Talent thing is my opinion, as I can say what I'd like about how I dislike Willa. Just to let you know, it's my opinion.2) The Hot 100 charts do combine all charts on what is big, so Willa may have hit the top 50 part of the Hot 100, but that, to me, is still minor.3) Talent/#1 Willa Fan (whoever the heck you call her/him) is writing more than just one 1-star review for artists that have so called ""no talent"" (which they do), and making multiple accounts to do that. Which, I think is 100% unfair to those artists. I've never done such a thing.So, ok, we've stated both of our opinions. Agree with one, and shut up."
3,2005 is good....the cd guys who flops!,"and I thought 2004 part 2 was bad...totally hits 2005 is horrible! I can see letting tyler hilton be on since he is a new artist...but ""1, 2 step?"" that was like some annoying disney radio song. I looked her up just to find out she is the 1-hit-wonder who sang 1 good song ""goodies.""I am happy T.I. is on here.totally hits seems to be addicted to flops!"
3,This Fight is Still goin on and it's retarded,"Let's end this fight with saying both Ciara, Willa Ford, and whoever else you guys dissed are all talented because in my personal opinion I like both of there music.Ohh ya Totally Hits 2005 seems hot in my opinion."
2,wha on totally hits 2005,"I agree with you straight up! Talent made their point and is right...that kid/hater just needs to stop and grow up! Their facts are totally wrong and they speak were unknowingly/immature! This is not a chatroom!!Anyway, like what the person below { a smart one :-) } If anyone does discover a tracklisting, please inform us. Hopefully it will be as great as Totally Hits 2001 was (the best one so far) and not another flop like this one! :-)"
2,Totally Hits...More Like Totally Outdated,"The second volume of Totally Hits 2004 emphasizes hit singles from the middle months of the year, while tracing back a little even to late 2003 in order to fill out the disc. It's just as stylistically broad, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's as diverse. A handful of artists who were included on the first volume make return appearances; if someone were to pick up the two volumes several years down the road, they'd be falsely led to believe that the charts of 2004 were dominated by the likes of retrorockers Jet and young RB veteran Monica. Out of the 20 songs here, only a handful are remotely memorable, which goes to show that the year continued to be a lackluster year for pop music. Much of the disc is filled out by middleoftheroad rock bands and safe, inoffensive poprap hits. At least Kevin Lyttle's dancehall crossover hit ""Turn Me On"" and Big Rich's rowdy ""Save a Horse"" are here to shake things up a little.Recommended: No"
2,A Mess,"There was huge potential in this project, but it's really not been realised.They dogmatically attempt to reproduce notes and harmonies from the songs 'as is' rather than rework creatively to achieve an overall flow. Songs are also over-complicated rather than seeking a purity of sound and harmony. This really jars, as this is where Massive Attack excel. It also feels over-produced (trying to make up for poor composition?).I was hoping for something intelligently re-worked to fit the instruments used, such as Christopher O'Riley did superbly with Radiohead. Instead, this seems to be cashing in on the name rather than getting to the heart of the music."
3,"Nice, although it's not Massive's way...","The intention is good, but it is clear that Massive Attack has not been involved in this project. They are all good covers of Massive Attack, but I miss their style in the songs..."
1,Cabelas outdoor adventure game,This game was hard to load and hard to understand. The instructions were almost useless. I could not get past the first level and still do not know much about options and what to expect. Also the game is boring and level one is so difficult (if I was even doing it right) that I wondered if there was something wrong with the game. I tried for a couple months on and off to play this game and never did have even a small success. I would give this game to an enemy if I had one! This game is awful!!
5,cabela outdoor adventure 2006,This game is fun for teens and adults. We spent 2 days after Christmas playing it as a family! So much to do in this game! We love it!
3,Nice compromise,"This review is mostly for parents of teenage kids, worried about the level of violence in computer and other video games.In this software, players are offered 11 ""exotic locations"" and 32 game animals to hunt.Sportsmen can also fish for 11 species of game fish, and play with a thousand varieties of camping clothing and other gear.As I said recently about another Cabela offering, I'm not thrilled with the shooting. On the other hand, the game offers a fine compromise for parents trying to avoid the truly excessive blood, gore and guts contained in most current war and space age games for teens. This game tests marksmanship, and has no gore or guts whatsoever.This game requires real strategy and planning, and players can enjoy a large variety of scenic nature settings.The game is a decent compromise."
3,A good look at John Wayne without the scholarly commitment,"This biography succeeds in its evenhanded portrayal of John Wayne. No doubt some will criticize it because Davis doesn't spend his time eschewing Wayne's politically incorrect opinions, but neither does the author lionize Wayne the man. What you have left is a concise and readable 400 page biography that covers all the movies and all the wives. Davis gives his opinions as to why the Wayne legend still survives, and what his fellow actors thought of him way back when.Interesting is the story behind the making of the ALAMO, a film he produced, directed and starred in, the subsequent Oscar campaign, and the aftermath. Also interesting is Wayne's relationship with director John Ford, whom he loved, and their disagreements."
1,Creative Writing Class Gone Bad,"This book, I hate to say, is painfully bad. Too many overwrought metaphors, convoluted descriptions, and basically convoluted story line. I couldn't even finish it-I would much rather read my seventh grade son's creative writing assignments."
3,Racy Tale,"Anne Newton Walther debuts as a novelist in the most difficult genre of romantic-historic fiction, which typically pleases neither the romantic nor the historian. Ms. Walther's contribution to the genre is accomplished and balanced. Her colourful and compelling fictional characters hold their own with historical figures. Her tale races across the background of the American Revolution with riveting progress. It's a most enjoyable read and would make a terrific film."
1,Amazon misleading,"This is a 36 page piece of fictitious nonsense. The ""Look inside product"" information from Amazon is completely misleading. It shows a color-illustrated 72 page guide with the isbn 0890514380. My daughter used her birthday Amazon gift card from her uncle to buy this item. What you are actually sent is a flimsy guide of little substance, full with erroneous information(isbn 10-1-60092-007-1). The shipping price costs more than the original price to send it back. So, we will throw it in the trash instead. The Amazon tags are also incorrect - it has nothing to do with ""minerals"" or ""history."""
1,Not Scientific,"The Bible cannot be used as proof of anything since there is no evidence to support that anything in the bible is accurate. If you want to believe in creation that is your business but there is absolutely nothing scientific about it, it is a belief based on faith. Unless creationism can be explained through scientific means and not through biblical references it is not science and should not be classified as such."
1,"Yeah, right","This is a typical rejection of science in favor of distortion. No objective analysis here. It is, instead, a twisted application of non-logic in order to explain objective truth (that fossils exist) in the context of a simple-minded dogmatic view of Earth history. Believe it only if you reject rational thought.Needless to say, this is not a science book and should not ever be classified as such."
4,Great product for the price,"Very Good product. No problems or regrets. Took them to Costa Rica and they did everything I needed. Once or twice I found myself wishing that I'd sprung for the ""zoom"" model. I have had the Nikon Travelite II for 20+ years and they still work fine."
5,Great Product!,"I had a pair of Nikon Travelites since 1989. I was heartbroken when they were lost/stolen on my last trip. Fortunately Nikon still makes them, a slight change in model, but the optics seem even a little better than my old pair. Great product for your money."
5,Bang for your buck,"Don't hesitate to pucrchase these binoculars. Image clarity and overall lightness make them a ""go-to"" product for indoor sports viewing, play productions, hiking, camping, birding, etc. Yes, it would be nice if the lens caps were attached somehow but you just can't beat them for the price."
1,Do not buy these binoculers.,These binoculers are hard to use and near imposible to focus. They could not be made to stay in alignment and the warranty does not cover repairs. Repair costs to keep them usable is more than the original price. The only thing good about them is they are light and small.
3,CD Content Is Different From The Original Album,"The original Edizione D'Oro album (released in 1969 on the Philips label) contained versions of the 4 Season's hits that have never appeared anywhere else. This Ace CD does not include all of those alternate versions, such as ""Big Man In Town"". I am grateful for the Edizione D'Oro versions that were included on this CD, but Ace should have given it a different title. Now, with the ""Edizione D'Oro"" title held by a CD in circulation, it is unlikely any company will ever consider reissuing the original album in its entirety."
1,Money for old rope!,"Yet another unbelievably bad job of editing together some really poor footage and claiming it to be a historically significant program. A professional editor would not be able to produce work this bad even if he really tried, and he would certainly never put his name on it if he did.As a professional video/DVD reviewer I am amazed that anyone would have the audacity to offer material of this abysmal quality for sale, and embarrassed for the people who are gullible enough to buy it."
2,"Overwritten, but great pics","This wasn't the book I remembered from my childhood. It's the same book, it's just a lot less enthralling than I remember. The story is painfully slow and overwrought; kind of like Green Eggs & Ham but a lot less clever. OTOH the pics are terrific."
3,hdcd sampler,Sounds excellent on the stereo. Only concern is that it could be a little bit longer for the price.
5,always good,Never disappointed with Harry Bosch Novels and the twist and turns of the story that Connelly creates. This one is no exception even though it was read out of order.
4,Stubborn,"Harry Bosch never gives up on a case, his years of experience really makes for an interesting character! The book is fast paced and keeps you guessing about what the outcome will be!!"
1,The worst CD by a great artist,"As some listeners have noted, this CD is a glimpse into the brilliant virtuosity of African percussionist and xylophonist Bernard Woma. The man is in a class by himself.Unfortunately, this CD is poorly recorded and mastered even worse. The sound quality obscures what's going on with the music. Any of Bernard's other CD's are much, much better -- and if you want a great live performance, buy ""Bernard Woma in Concert"" (I don't know if it's on Amazon yet, but search in Google and you can easily buy it).Someone here wrote that the problem with this ""Pito Bar"" CD is that it was a bootleg, which would explain it. And give another big reason to pick up a better CD by this great artist!!"
3,Not as good as the Canadian DVD,"I bought this because I watched the DVD in Canada. This is not the same DVD as sold in Canada. The Canadian version was more in depth and lasted much longer. Instead of a minute for each skit, their version took about 10 minutes for each skit. This seemed more like a TV show than the Gags DVD they sell in Canada. It was funny, but I was disappointed that it was not the one I thought I would receive. The Canadian DVD was 10 times better."
3,Vampire manga...,"The idea is simple - a vampire girl, named Hazuki, is trapped in a castle in Europe and wishes to escape so she can search for her mother, in Japan. A cameraman, named Kouhei Midou, helps her escape (to save his own skin) and they both end up in Japan.This manga is less horror and more fantasy. Even with vampires, magic and psychic mediums the story line feels weak as if the artist didn't really know where to go with the plot or what to do with the characters. While slightly interested by the events within the book I don't feel the need to rush out and buy the next volume."
2,Poorly made,"I had ordered a 16"" disco ball several years ago, unfortunately it was stolen and after several failed attempts to purchase from the same vendor I ordered this one through Amazon and as it was being hung new from the box, several mirror tiles fell off I had it replaced. The new ball arrived very quickly and although the mirror tiles are not falling off it looks like a 3rd grader placed the mirror tiles on the ball. I am keeping it since its my replacement ball and hopefully no one will notice the poor craftsmanship way up at the ceiling, but am not happy at all with the quality."
1,Lesson learned,"This book seemed like a collection of curses the author heard over the years and you could almost hear her laughing at the stupidity. Granted, some superstitions are humorous but if people truely believe they have been ""tagged"" then they are not stupid to them. Why publish a book about something you find foolish? As far as the curses she doesn't dismiss, the removal methods are done with ingredients a fraction of the peopulation could ever hope to find. I felt like I had purchased someones high school report - one that probably got much less than an A!"
1,"this book should be titled 'superstitions, curses & omens'","99.9% of this book is a bunch of superstitions. One of the (very few) ways she suggests for removing bad luck involves rubbing a brown egg on your body for 9 days. another one is scattereing salt around you while facing east.from what i can see.....there is but 12 lines of chants (pretty good ones, i think) for changing your luck....i would have atleast expected a page or 2 of such chants for a book with this title."
2,Not on par with his other books -save your money,"Nasty People by the same author is good and helpful. I married a woman with narcissistic personality disorder and thought this might give me some additional insights. Unfortunately the author doesn't seem to consider that women can be Narcissists and focuses more on emotional types of drama and behaviors. If you are looking for insight into the peculiarities of female Narcissists, you won't find those answers here."
5,Guys you have to read this,"Lets put it this way, After reading this book you will become not only understanding but compasionate to the feelings of women but also know how to take back your ""control"" with out them knowing it."
5,A must for understanding how the world works,"Ok, for those not up on their biology or the Gaia hypothesis, it might be difficult to get through, but Hypersea is well written and fascinating for those interested in knowing how life has and will continue to evolve in more complex ways. An extremely important addition to the Gaia hypothesis. You will never see the world in the same way again.The Hypersea and Gaia hypotheses are the only two clearly defined scientific theories that have been put forth to give us some answers to questions not asked by most of biology."
1,eh......,Knock In Boots is okay..... I guess. I heard that on a commercial. Don't buy the cd; it's not worth your dough!
1,Misleading Advertisement,"The advertising page lists Windows XP as one of the platforms that this can run on. However, when I got the product it listed Windows 95, 98, 2000 or ME. NT is not supported. A user on XP Home Edition in group Limited cannot run this game."
5,BUY IT!!!,"As the battle scene opens, the 3-D landscape, the hills and the mountains, present a majestic setting. The enemy armies marching towards you in organized military formation makes you feel like you're a general in an actual battle; in that very moment you feel like you're out to conquer the world. Undoubtedly this game is the best war game on the planet. If you want guerilla warfare, get Starcraft or Warcraft. If you want real battles, get Shogun: Total War Warlord Edition. You won't be disappointed, believe me."
2,Telesteps 106X Canvas Carry Bag with Strap,For the weight of the ladder this bag needs to better constructed. One seam has already split and I've only taken out of the bag 3 times! The fit itself is good.
1,kyo ku shin kai's mas oyama- d,"quality very bad , not what I expected, next time I'll think twice before ordering again."
2,Not so good.,Not very entertaining and the sound quality is just awful. Don't waste your time or money on this one. A real stinker in more ways than one.
5,Nikon Travelite V 12x25 Binocular,"I bought these primarily for field work where I have to backpack in for the day. They are a tad to large for what I wanted, but I continue to use them as they bring in clear images and are light. An excellent choice for day trips and in thickly wooded areas. Nikon quality can't be beat."
4,binoculars,"These were perfect for concert viewing and lightweight for extended holding times, best bang for the buck"
4,Intermediate Student Kumite Fundamentals,"Sensei Dalke explains 3 and 1 step kumite. He explains not just the moves but also the timing, distance, and angles. It is valuable for all of us, but especially so for intermediate students who want to go beyond the usual explanations. A bonus for black belts is the ""filler"" material: Sensei Dalke performs Gojugiho sho."
1,Burns,"This hair spray caused a terrible red rash to appear all over my neck and back. The burning was unbearable! We had to purchase poison ivy medicine to calm the ""fire."" The rash included nickel-sized bumps. It is a dangerous chemical combination."
3,Ella Johnson Has Serious Pitch Problems!,"Buddy Johnson made some great music. ""Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball"" is truly a classic, and one I find myself frequently singing. However, none of the reviewers seem to notice that his sister, Ella Johnson, has serious pitch problems and is clearly and pitifully unable to lock onto the ""sweet spot"" of the melody on almost every song that she sings! It is painful to hear. This is a shame, because the music is so great and it is not yet possible to find a Buddy Johnson cd that does not feature his sister. If you are not bothered by singing that never seems to find proper pitch, then by all means buy all the Buddy Johnson music available. If, however, out-of-tune singing ruins a song for you, I suggest another artist until a Buddy-only cd is released."
4,"Where is ""Let's Beat Out Some Love' ?","Where is the first hit that Buddy Johnson had on Decca in February of 1943 titled 'Let's Beat Out Some Love"" ? How could they omit this essential recording. It was their 2nd all-time biggest R&B charter behind ""When My Man Comes Home"". It(Let's Beat)went to #2 on the R&B charts and stayed their for 2 weeks in the early part of 1943. Again- this essential recording should've been the lead track on this compilation- still-it's a great buy and a great collection."
5,Baby LOVES this blanket,"I bought this blanket for my daughter (even tho she did NOT need another blanket, LOL). It is SOOOOOOOOOOO soft and she just adores it. She loves the fuzzy blankets. It is not stiff at all, it is a super-soft fuzzy-pile material. It has held up well in the wash. She alternates this one with a similar-material one in the wash cycle. She won't sleep with anything else.Ferrekingdom"
2,what a bummer.....,"I was on my way out of town and pick this book up on a whim as I breezed through a book store...I love western romance, but I had a hard time finishing this one!I did'nt realize it was a reissue, and after checking other reveiws after I returned home..I can see now why this rancher was such a demanding man (I am glad times have changed!).Anyway...this paperback was a waste of paper...I didn't care for the way Jason treated Kate and I felt it was borderline abusive and Kate just put up with it! Half of the book was spent describing what everyone was wearing, do you really need to know what someone has on everytime they enter the room? or when they light a cigarette? The romance was hard to find in this novel..at least the heart pounding kind I was looking for! I will be more careful when I grab a Diana Palmer book in the future.."
4,Not what I expected,"After reading the reviews on this book I was extremely hesitant to buying this novel. However, I bought it on a wim and absolutely loved it. I can not disagree more with the other reviews. Diana Palmer takes Kate and Jason through a whirl wind of emotional stir. Kate having always been looked at as his ""little sister"" caused Jason some serious life questions. An unexpected twist put them through more emotion then I have seen in most books. Granted he does smoke a lot, which is a huge turn off, however his flaws make up who he is. This book does a lot of repeat actions and arguments, however, I throughly enjoyed the emotional twister!"
3,Diamond Spur,"The back cover reads:""Kate Whittman never wanted anyone but Texas rancher Jason Donovan. Even as a teen, she had fantasized about his touch, masking her emotions in teasing banter and easy friendship. Now at twenty, Kate was a sensual, beautiful woman with a woman's need for a man's embrace. Yet Kate was also a woman of exceptional talent. And when her fashion designs brought her a fabulously tempting offer, she rushed to share the news with Jason. But the proud owner of the Diamond Spur Ranch had only scorn for her success--and definite plans of his own. Without warning, he covered her mouth with a blazing kiss, sparking her smoldering feelings into flames of red-hot desire. This was what she had yearned for...though surrender could turn her other dreams to ashes. For becoming Jason's woman might mean having to choose between the man she loved and everything else the world offered."""
4,Not just a love story.,I enjoyed this book very much. Not only a love story but a life lesson. Jason and Kate helped each other realize that life is full of surprizes only if you open your heart. I couldn't put it down and as all her books I've read I was not disappointed
1,Observe a Writer's Growth,"I was amazed at how sophomoric and amateurish was this great writer's first novel. Stout was obviously a competent wordsmith, even at the beginning, but appeared hopelessly far from ever becoming an author of merit. ""Her Forbidden Knight"" reads like a college Creative Writing major's attempt to create a Harlequin Romance. It's worth reading, however, to illustrate the way a writer can grow. Placed alongside one of the later Nero Wolfe novels, it may serve as inspiration for an aspiring author who has not yet gotten the hang of it and fears that s/he never will."
1,A disappointment,"Some first novels should be allowed to rest in peace. You can't blame the publisher for wanting to exploit the well-deserved reputation that Rex Stout later earned for the Nero Wolfe series, but this book did not deserve to be re-issued."
5,fabulous shade of orange,"This is perfect for what I wanted! The perfect shade of orange, very padded and fit my computer like a glove. Much better than black or white, it really stands out! Love it!"
1,Don't Believe The Hype About Derek Bailey.....He's Not Worthy Of A Penny Of My Money,"Derek Bailey is a British guitarist who was on the forefront of the free jazz music scene. Although, he's been around since the 40s, his ""music"" is completely oblivious to melody and harmony, which in turn makes his playing intolerable. This whole mentality of askewing melody, rhythm, and harmony, the very foundation of music, is ignorant. The important thing to learn from this review is that you shouldn't waste your money on someone who's ignorance is painted on everything he's ever done. He may be a respected avant-garde jazz guitarist, but he isn't respected by me. My jazz guitar heroes will always be Bill Frisell, Pat Metheny, John Scofield, Mike Stern, Wes Montgomery, Kenny Burrell, Jim Hall, and John Abercrombie. All of whom, can play and comprehend what music is all about."
5,Time Traveler Inc. - When We Do Meet Again,"This is book 4 and probably my most favorite of this series. I would definitely recommend Hollie Van Horne time travel books, I still have 6,7 & 8 to read, but I am looking forward to them. If you love time travel - you will enjoy this book!"
3,unhappy,"This was a semi interesting book. I was very disapointed that the price of the book was so high. The printing was so big that I thought I was back in grade school.The subject was interesting, but all to short of a story. I was very unhappy."
4,A Great Time Travel!!!!,"This was a first time read for me and I found Ms. Van Horne a very entertaining author. This book had a great romance, wonderful location, and a great mystery.A doctor falls in love with his resident ghost and finds that he wants to help her onto the next place. He is reluctant to tell anyone about his feelings and thinks that he may just be going insane when he finds an ad for Time Travelers. He contacts Sam and the next thing he knows he is planning a trip to visit his love in person. He plans on saving her from being killed perhaps by her husband. Problem is he is a dead ringer for the bad guy but he will do what he has to give peace to Isabelle.This was a very touching story and I found myself laughing and crying. If you enjoy reading a story that touches on all of your emotions as being creative this is the story for you."
2,When We Do Meet Again,"The premise and logistics of time travel made sense, but it was a little shallow, not much depth to me. The proofreader was a little careless, as I found a lot of typographical errors in the book. I did enjoy the descriptions of the house."
2,Juvenile writing,"The premise of this story is good and interesting - buy an old house, see a ghost, travel back in a time loop, interact with the ghost and return to the future with the knowledge that you can enter the time loop and visit the ghost again. Good idea! Writing - atrocious! Any teacher would give this an F for writing ability. For instance - at one point the main character exits the tub - normal - and instead of making it sexy or routine we get a Peterman's catalog account - ""a french blue, egyptian pile, 100 percent cotton towel"" --- PLEASE - who talks, writes or thinks like that except the seller of the towel? That's only one example of the silly writing lack-ability. Two stars for story - no stars for keeping my interest with vocabulary above that of a toddler."
3,"Excellent story, short on editing/formatting","I ordered this book based on its enthusiastic reviews. The plot is very well-thought out, with no holes and good continuity. Smooth segues and management of detail maintain the integrity of the story. I believe it is well-researched on aspects of the time period--culture, dress, attitudes, mores, etc. From a story-telling perspective, I believe it should have been awarded 4 stars. Unfortunately, and somewhat unfairly for the author, words that are misused (gate, rather than gait; overdo, rather than overdue; etc.), improper punctuation, and formatting that is not typical to industry standard bias the overall perception of the book. While I very much enjoyed the general scenario, I'm undecided as to committing to more of the series."
2,Fails after 2 years,"I installed the first Watts 70A in 2007 behind my tankless water heater (steam boiler with integral domestic hot water heater). Well it failed after 2 years of use. The spring inside corroded and broke. I bought a repair kit, which didn't fix it. So I un-soldered it, soldered in a new one, and alas it failed after two years of use. Anyway, I pulled the guts out and turned off the cold supply to it, effectively bypassing it. I'm going to try a Honeywell mixing valve."
1,Will never order from this company again,"I have not received this book. It was due on Feb 10th last date, it is still not here. The book was ordered back in December !Very disappointed.Artists Gardens"
2,Problematic recipes,"I have found problems with the recipes. When adding half and half to the Tomato Bisque, the mixture curdled. It tasted OK, but looked unattractive. Because the recipe for Apricot Oatmeal Muffins had no butter or oil, they stuck to the silicone baking cups and had to be dug out. The Cranberry Blondies seemed extremely sweet. On the other hand, the salads are light and tasty and a good choice for people wanting to eat a lighter meal."
5,"Wonderful, versatile cook book.","Dot Vartan's latest cookbook, ""Delicious Salad Meals,"" is a must for any cook who needs ideas for light, delicous meals that are not complicated to prepare. What I like most about the book is the organization, which divides the salad/meal recipes by type, e.g., poultry, meat, seafood, etc., and then once you choose a recipe, side dishes are given that complement to complete a meal. The recipes are delicious, easy to follow, well written, and include ingredients that are not hard to find at the grocery store. A fine resource for weekday meals for those who want to put together a healthy meal for the family after a day at work. The book provides great ideas for party salads, too! And I've given many copies away as hostess gifts. A versatile, affordable cook book that I recommend highly."
5,Lovely book,"I havent tried the recipes yet. I will, but anyway, II bought the book because of the nice edition, the drawings and of course the meals!"
2,Cinemascope versus Pan & Scan,"I believe this Fox Archive release is in pan and scan. If this is so, forget it and buy theofficial Fox release from Spain which is in its original 2.35 Cinemascope ratio, excellentpicture and sound. It is available on Amazon.If Fox can release a 2.35 version in Spain, why can't they do the same in the U.S?"
3,recrudescence,Twoud be higher if they would release a widescreen version with all scenes intact rather thanthis chopped up mess.Near excellence should be rewardedby the accolades of the massesto repudiate the lack lusterfortunes of todays mediocrity andto add to the plethora of applausereuired to extend a glad hand.
1,"For Pan & DScan, not for the movie",This is a terrific movie. It should be seen in the original widescreen version. It loses a lot in the pan & scan format. I will NOT buy this DVD because of that. It is ruined in this version.
5,Night People -- just like old times,"I wasn't in Berlin, but this could just as easily been Frankfort am Main. I rode the paternosters (elevators) in the IG Farben building a thousand times. The on-location scenes are outstanding, even the inside the buildings was right. The story, the cast, the settings were all really great. I've watched it many time but have never tired of it. I plan to watch it many more times. Old memories relived are a real treasure."
3,overly energetic,"The Vienna Piano Trio attack this music with real gusto - in fact, too much gusto for me. The tempos are not unreasonable, but there are too many places where you feel that drama has become melodrama. The first movement of the D Minor trio is representative: the underlying sense of turmoil, which is already embedded in the music, is pushed to a point that just doesn't feel comfortable or ""right."" Admittedly there's alot of excitement here, but I think too much so. A better alternative for the Mendelssohn trios would be the Florestan Trio's disc on Hyperion:Mendelssohn: The Piano Trios."
1,No justice,This dvd was awful and I don't advise buying it. The video quality was poor and in the last part when master otsuka was runnin kata it was so dark you couldn't see.If Master Otsuka was alive he would flip.
1,No even 1 star,The introduction is terrible. The content that you can actually see is mediocre at best and the end is so poor you can barley see anything. You can see well enough to tell that the Kata are not complete. Probable due to the fact that the cut out portions were even worse...Do not buy this product! Based on this video alone I would never purchase anything from masterline video or risingsunproductions again! Otsuka would not approve!
1,"""There's a sucker born every minute.""","Another piece of unadulterated garbage from Masterline Productions, poorly produced from multi-generational copies of sub-standard 8mm film created by hand-held cameras. The fact that it is even advertised for sale confirms the saying, wrongly attributed to P. T. Barnum as it happens that, ""There's a Sucker Born Every Minute""J. Edwards, Video Reviewer,Classical Fighting Arts magazine"
5,Great Idea Book,"If you loke to make cards and tags or are just starting out. I recommend this book. It has 55 pages with many ideas per page. At the end of the book there is 5 pages of templates for envelopes, tags, boxes and more. In the center is 2 pages of vellum quotes to rip out and use.Table of Contents include:FriendshipKeeping In TouchMemorable MomentsTerms of EndearmentInvitesWedding/AnniversaryCards of GratitudeNew Arrival9 different Holiday GreetingsBirthdayHealth/HappinessPhoto Greeting CardsTagsThere is many ideas, tecniques, quotes, tips and more in this wonderful book. I get scrappers block and this book really helps out. I totally recommend this book."
3,Just Okay,"This book was just okay for me. I thought it would have actual step-by-step instructions, but it seems it only contains pictures, and list of items used. It's okay for reference if you want to ""copy"" the card as best you can."
3,Not What I Expected,"The Subtitle of the book is; ""The hottest trends and techniques for creating cards and tags for all occasions.""I assumed from this that the book would have how-to's on making some of the projects. But it really doesn't. Each page does have a tip: ""Create mini cards and tags from your scraps. They are fun to give and receive.""Another tip: ""Stamp a pattern on to a diecut."" The tips are just to general to be helpful.The photos are great, lots of ideas here and a supply list...but no coaching, or how-to's. I have to admit the book is visually very attractive and the mistake here may be mine as I was looking for a book with projects and instructions.If you are an experienced crafter and card-maker this book does have a lot of examples and ideas. But for me, a beginner, it just did not have the information I had hoped for."
4,"Works well, light weight, but could be improved",The Corner Buddy has worked well for me. It allows me to replace corner trim easily. Despite what others have said it does reach over gutter downspouts that are attached to corner trim.I appreciate the unit's light weight due to its aluminum construction I just wish the paint didn't peel so easily off the metal. This is just a cosmetic issue though.I also wish it would attach and remove from the ladder easier. The four wing nut fastened u-bolts are a bit primitive. A spring loaded clamping mechanism like the Werner ladder stabilizer would be slick.
5,Qualcraft 2470 Corner Buddy Ladder Stabilizer,"If there is a need for something someone will make it, and indeed this is true in this case. I needed a way to work on the corners of my house to replace some rotted trim; a way of placing the ladder on the corners would solve the problem. I stumbled across the Corner Buddy on the Qualcraft web site and then surfed the web and found the best price on the stabilizer on Amazon. I had hired a contractor to do the work and he had not seen the Corner Buddy before. After using it in a couple locations at my home he was impressed and said he would have to get his own. It worked great on both corners and flat surfaces and you can't beat the price especially with free super saver shipping."
1,What a headache!,"I bought this unit for a new build and was thoroughly disappointed. Upon attempting to load my OS for the first time, the disc was not recognized. I loaded my OS through another drive and had no problems. After getting the system up and running, this drive was very selective about the discs it read. It would not even read the software CD that came bundled with the unit. My biggest complaint is really about Pioneer's customer service. After countless calls troubleshooting with them, they tried to tell me the rest of my hardware was defective. This is simply not the case seeing as the system works fine without this drive. After a great amount of debate with Pioneer and their insistance that I incorrectly installed the firmware update, they have been generous enough to offer to look at it if I pay shipping! I expect to come across a defective unit now and then, but I'm appalled at the quality of the customer service."
1,Problem with installation.,"Couldn't get my system to recognize the drive via plug n play. Pioneer does not have phone tech support. Have had the drive in computer for weeks and haven't been able to use it, I'm probably going to have to pay someone to set it up. I've owned PC computers since 1986. I've installed cd drives a half dozen times over the years and this is first time I've run into a problem."
4,Oldy but Goody,"This book was written 50 years ago by an esteemed group of psychoanalysts in the inner circle of Karen Horney as an attempt to explain the process of Psychoanalysis to the public, helping to elucidate what goes on, what to expect, and what are the respective roles of the analyst and patient. In our world of quick-fix, medication-oriented therapies, this book is sadly rather dated. It is a fine work, but relies on techniques that are no longer practiced in their pure form, and I look forward to a new book that talks to the public about the ways to look at contemporary treatments (hopefully NOT written by a drug company!) so as to approach the therapeutic alliance intelligently. There is, however, much to be learned here from the quick reviews of some basic schools of therapy, a nice overview of Horney's Culturalist orientation, and a demystification of what might be popularly thought of as a scary or intolerably deep investment of effort."
3,A rare misfire for Douglas,"Though there are some very interesting parts of this recording, there are too many dead spots where nothing substantial seems to be happening. Douglas, always looking for new configuation for his expressions, can't be faulted for trying to recapture the spirit of Coltrane's Ascension in a 90's mode."
1,Copy / poor quality,"Quality of the DVD is too poor,It is a copy of a VHSand a copy of a DVD.It is not original.Also, the sound has a very bad quality.This makes the content nos attractive either."
3,"Good writing, sparse production, stays within the lines","Faulkner is a good song writer and has plenty of chops on his guitar. No one really cuts loose on these tunes, but that's not what the project seems to be about. The songs could use more harmony vocals, and at times the choice of solo instrument (Sign of Love) is questionable. Overall, the fidelity is excellent and the tunes hold up well. Faulkner's writing style is similar to that of John Hiatt (a sincere compliment). If you want simple tunes that are well crafted and well performed, this is a good choice. I'd recommend it."
4,"Worth 100 Listens by John Birbari, Lander, WY","Most CD's you're lucky if you find one or two good songs. Every single song on this CD is a keeper. The only question is which ones you like better. Although the word unique is over used today, this album is a unique blend of Texan, Cajun and R&B with a little rock and roll and ballad thrown in for good measure. You're gonna' love it, and Tom's new CD, ""Raise the Roof"" is even better. It features Dr. John and James Govan on a hard driving tribute, ""Blues Across America."" Pick up both of these, you won't regret it."
2,Great Wilderness but this book is very bad,"I have done about six trips to the Gila Wilderness over the last five years, as well as many other backpacking trips. While I generally like Falcon guides, this is one of the worst backpacking books I have used. It duplicates passages by including the same portion of a hike several times in different hikes. The author is more interested in flowery descriptions than in safety and accurate trail descriptions. Hiking in the Southwest, accurate descriptions of water locations are key, but the author is very vague on the location of springs. Very unlike the other Falcon books, such as the one on the Superstitions Wilderness Area. It may be you are stuck buying this book until Falcon finds a better author but beware as not all the trail descriptions are correct, especially Turkeyfeather mountain."
5,Everything you want in a trail guide,"What I like about this series and this particular guide is the wealth of useful information provided. Each hike is described comprehensively and the descriptions are supplemented with maps, elevation profiles, and mileages to key points. Plus all the usual info is provided about water, seasons, maps, etc. This gives all the information required to make informed decisions when planning a trip. A minor but nice point: the maps all are oriented with north up. Too many guidebooks provide maps with multiple orientations which can be confusing for the unwary."
1,"this is a low-end classical guitar, not a real steel string acoustic.","This is NOT a true steel string acoustic guitar. This is a low-end classical/folk guitar made for nylon strings, but strung with steel strings instead. This guitar (as all classical guitars) lacks the metal truss rod in the neck and the internal bracing needed to withstand the tension of steel strings. The result is a neck that curves forward under the strain, resulting in unplayable string height, and TERRIBLE intonation.It is not ethical to market this as a child's or a beginner's guitar just because of the smaller size and low cost. A beginner would go nowhere trying to learn on this. Do not buy."
3,i personally love the guitar cause...,i personally love the guitar cause ive fixed it up and i like to have alot but dont expect alot its not great it is only 30 dollars thats not a price if the guitar is good the cheapest good guitar goes from 100 and higher
1,Hoyle Puzzle Games 2003 Suck,"very dissappointed. The product label included games I was paying for and the actual dvd did not include them. Slide tiles, Majohn were not, contacted the seller with no response. Booo"
2,Hoyle Puzzle Games 2003 - a disappointment,"I have purchased all the Hoyle Collections (Board Games, Card Games, Word Games, Casino); and have found all of them to be superb...Have always said that Hoyle makes the best games. However, Puzzle Games falls far short of their usual efforts. Most games are boring, or a repetition of other packages (Anagrams, Crosswords, Hangman, Mahjonng). Not their best effort; and not what I was expecting from Hoyle."
2,Product worked well if it worked at all,I bought this product and it arrived DOA (Dead on Arrival). I called customer service and they sent me another one right away free of charge within 1 week. The replacement lasted me 12 months and it died. I recommnend not to buy it.
5,Excellent product,i bought this product for my mom who likes to drink tea very often. Both of my parents love its convenience.
5,Appreciated Gift,"So, my son is stationed overseas in a war zone and he really likes woodworking. My friend told me that there's this guy who was his most favorite woodworker, James Krenov. I sent my son two of Krenov's books, this one, The Impractical Cabinetmaker, and A Cabinetmaker's Notebook. Because many of our sons and daughters in the military are serving our country in places which have limited access to reading material, I suggest that care packages sent to them contain books and magazines that will inspire them and encourage them. These two books have done that for my son and he is most thankful for something to dream about until he returns. The speed at which Amazon facilitated delivery is very much appreciated by this dad."
2,Didn't match the hype.,"I just didn't like this book. Way too much new age ""fluffy"" stuff, not enough meat. I didn't even like the furniture the guy built - just didn't fit my style. I expected to like this book a lot more given its reviews - should have paid attention to some of the more negative reviews I guess. I certainly was not ""inspired"".Of course, I do not consider myself an artist either - I hack stuff together, trying to follow good plans where I can. My stuff turns out OK, but I have no asperations of making a work of art. Those with different goals may find more value in this. I don't have much interest in creating something new from scratch, an 'original' composition."
3,"Good quality, not for use with extended life battery","The quality of this item is good. However, do not use it with the bigger extended life battery and door. The phone then becomes too thick and the buttons are continuously being pushed while in the case. My husband makes multple calls without even realizing it. I would definitely recommend it for the standard battery."
2,phone pouch,"Nice pouch but not so accessable, hard to pull phone out also not so secure on your belt easily falls off but a good price!"
2,Cheap and Cheap,Though bearing the Nikon name these are just another one of the thousands of cheap Chinese-made binoculars that have flooded the market in the past 10 years. Optically these are not bad binoculars (for the price). Mechanically they are poorly made: flimsy plastic bodies which do not stand up to normal use.If you are looking for good binoculars look elsewhere.
5,wow,"I bought this after reading all the reviews. I dropped my old thermo in the parking lot and it started leaking soon after. After using the new Nissan thermo for the past few months, I am more than happy to say this purchase was definitely worth it. I filled the thermo yesterday at around 7am in the morning with hot tea and forgot to bring it to work. This morning I brought the thermo to work thinking, ""why waste good tea? if its cold, Ill just heat it up in a different cup"". I couldnt believe it when I poured it out - the tea was STILL HOT!! Of course its not boiling hot but plenty hot enough for me. I am just amazed and this is why I'm writing this review. Great purchase, easy to use, can't go wrong."
5,chocloate thermos,"This little thermos is really great. It keeps your drinks very hot for hours. Not 2 big, just right. I am real happy with it."
5,Just as expected and more.,I don't usually do reviews but this seller deserved a good one. Order a gameboy sp and everything arrived exactly like the description on the product and somewhere better. Thank you.
2,"NEW VERSION ALERT, NEXT COUNSLE IS COMING OUT, (...)","Nintendo relesed info about a new counsle ""NINTENDO DS"" coming out end of Q4. it will be backward compatable with gba games but it will be much better. it has two screens one touch sensetive with better graphics than N64 not to mention built in wireless capabilitys. So if you can wait! It wont be the best much longer. if you get this it will go down in popularaty and value not to menton be out of date real soon. (...)"
2,Getting It This Week,"Im Getting This Later In The Week. I Was Thinking Of Getting The Ds But What Is The Point At Having Kinda The Same Thing For The Same Price As Playstation 2. Who CAres If It Has 2 Screens. Sp Is Older And Has Better Games Like Star Wars. Im Looking To Get The Orange/Green,Flame Or Blue. Also Looking To Get Apprentice Of The Force.Overall What I Saw From My Friends Its A Handy Little Console On The Go. Will Write My Regular Review Fri Nite, SAT,or Sun My Ratings Are Like That Cause I Never Played It"
5,Great things do come in small packages,"I just purchased the GBASP, and while I have not played at great length, I must say that initially, I am blown away! I was attracted to it not only by the compact size and small screen, but the exceptional low price as well. It will be great to take my gaming habit wherever I want to go. In addition, it is not loaded with bells and whistles like it's newer brother, the DS, and is simple to use. I know of a few people whose only system is the Gameboy, so if you want something simple and portable, this is for you!the SP is very easy and fun to operate. In addition, the endless list of games will keep you busy for a long, long time.While everyone seems to be raving over the DS, I'm having a great time with the SP.Tip. Be sure to get a carrying case, as if you put it in your pockets, lint, dust, etc. will get into the system."
4,BEST OF ALL,GBA IS THE BEST SYSTEM.YOU CAN TAKE IT ENYWHERE IN THE WORLD.ALSO THE CO0L ONYX COLOR. THAT IS THE BEST COLOR.YOU CAN PLAY IN THE DARK TOO.THE LIGHT IS COOL.IT'S EVEN FITS YOU IN YOUR POCKET.ONYX COLOR DOSN'T SHOW ANY MARKS.
1,TERRIBLE!!!,"I understand this was going to be a used item, but nowhere did it say that it was going to be dirty, beat up beyond repair, or anything else that my item is.It looks as if the previous owner took a pen and carved into it everywhere. Even around the buttons it is carved, so even a face plate for the device wouldnt cover it up.I'll be returning this item and buying one from a different seller in hopes for a better item.Extremely disappointed.Oh and it says for the description it comes with 6 games and a charger??? I didnt receive anything but the gameboy itself. False advertisting."
4,Great little toy!,I really like ths gameboy. I like that it folds up so when you are playing it is big enough to grip without getting handcraps but it is small enough to fit in my purse. Fun!
4,cool,"This is a great game boy because of the color. when you get it dirty it doesnt matter ,you can't tell. Its a bummer that it's not stocked right now but if it is in stock i advise hardcore gamers to buy it and a case to keep it nice and shiny, it looks really cool that way. But always remember if you drop it youll be sorry."
5,Very Good!,"I've had this system for more than 2 years now and I haven't had any problems period. You can take this anywhere you go and you won't need batteries (a huge relief). There is a battery inside the Gameboy, so you can just load it up. While playing at night you'll need a light. Well, there's a light inside the screen that you can turn off or on (without will save you battery life). So far I own 7 games and I still have fun playing them.The Gameboy Advance SP is mainly for kids, seeing that there are alot of kiddie games for the system and it's definitely not breakable (unlike the PSP). It's also easy to get used to.Overall, this is a system for kids and it's definitely worth it. It's even cheap nowadays, so buy it and you won't regret it!"
4,"Stellar system, with a few drawbacks.","This system is, just like its counterpart, awesome, and handy to keep oneself entertained while traveling. But, mine broke after being dropped from a height of 5 feet. The LCD screen cracked. This broke my heart. This system is not as durable as Nintendo and others would have you believe. But, be that as it may, a great improvement on an already great system."
2,only worked for 6 months,"Nice looking unit. Easy to use. Quit running after 6 months. No longer cooled. If I would send it back to them, they would repair it. I don't have any way to get it back to them. I,also, do not want to invest any more money in it. I now have a very expensive filing cabinet. Because, it has a lock and key, it might become a safe."
4,"Works well, eventually","The first few days it heated up terribly on the top and wouldn't freeze anything, even when turned up to level ""5,"" but eventually it started working fine and we haven't had any trouble since."
5,Exta Freezer space,It gave me just the extra freezer space I needed at the time of purchase.One thing it needed to be defrosted
3,OK Book; Not Great,"I must say I am little disappointed. I would not tell someone not to buy this book but I would not tell someone to buy it. The book does deliver what it says on the cover. I am not so sure how powerful it is. It is about writing style and how to make it better, easier and faster. I am still trying to decide if I learned anything from this book that is of great value. I am sure I will reference this book in the future and for $10.00; hay what the hell. I have bought computer books for ten times that amount that I hated. If you have difficulty writing and getting your ideas on to paper maybe this book is for you. It is short and it is very readable. I would classify this as an average book. And sorry Sue since my name is not on this I just pounded it out on the keyboard and let the letters fall where they may."
5,Power Sales Writting is as essential a tool as a dictionary!,"Share this book with everyone in your organization that has any sales contact and increase their their effectiveness. Sue cuts to the heart of good writting skills. Her book is easy to read and offers countless tips on letter writting, e-mails and better communication."
5,Whether you consider yourself a sales person or not,"Whatever you're selling - a product, service or an idea - this bookgives practical tips to feel more confident about how you word yourmessage whether it is an email or a formal business letter. It's fun andeasy to read. I recommend Power Sales Writing whether you consider yourselfa sales person or not!Cheryl Goar, Executive Director, Arizona Nursery Association"
3,Not a $20 book.,"For $10 I could rate this as a good book. It just doesn't have $20 of usefull info. Its coverage of lathes to buy is very limited for a beginner. The section on making chucks, while usefull, is not anything you can't find on the web. The technique section is the big weak point. The author obviously has a great deal of skill, but does a terrible job of getting it across. This is especially true in his description of how to use the skew chisel. This is an OK first book, but should not be your only book on how to use a wood lathe."
1,bad experience,"ordering from these people was a joke I never got the product but they kept my money anyway. Had several e-mails to and from but for some reason they just would not take care of the problem. I would not recomend buying anything from these people I am just thankfull that it was not a lot of money. Long story short, don't buy anything from MOTOR CITY BOOKS!"
5,The most moving book I have read in years,I read this book for a change of pace from my usual genre and it was Christmas at the time. I read it in one sitting...thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it. It should be a Christmas Classic. I know I will reread it every year to remember that there is more to Christmas than money. A very uplifting feel good book.
5,BEST BOOK OF THE SEASON,"If you're tired of all the murder, the violence, the anti-heros, ""The Christmas Wish"" is just the book for you. It starts out as a very simple story, but soon begins to blossom into an uplifting message, without being preachy. I cried so much reading the last two pages I could barely focus on the words. Richard Siddoway makes his characters seem very human and real. This book is a must-read for the Christmas season or any other time. Truly a ""feel good"" book!"
5,To Root to Toot to Parachute: What Is a Verb (Words Are Cate,My five year old daughter loves this book! Prosmitsky's colorful illustrations make it so much more fun learning the parts of speech. My daughter adores the illustrator's goofy pillow-like cats!
5,John McCromack in Song,"I just received this CD from Amazon and I am absolutely amazed that recordings made over 90 years ago sound so wonderful! If anyone ever doubted why John McCormack was lauded as the greatest tenor of the first half of the 20th Century, just listen to this CD. For clarity of tone, for phrasing, for vocal range, and for pure emotion, no one could possibly surpass him. It is a real joy to hear that incredible tenor voice all these many years later. Thank God he lived after audio recording was possible. This is a real collector's item."
3,Opera Goes Pop,"John McCormack was one of the most popular singers of his day. He was primarily known for his operatic tenor, but he also had great success with his recordings of popular songs. This disc collects a number of his more popular recordings. I would have preferred a larger sampling of his work from the 1910s, but it does have several classics, including ""Somewhere a Voice Is Calling"" (which NARAS has inducted into their Recording Hall of Fame) and ""The Lost Chord"" (one of the most popular songs of the turn of the twentieth century)."
2,The cover is deceiving..,"Apparently, the editors of those old PBS specials made in the 70's are still around, because they definetly pulled them out of the works for this. The quality of the disk is revolting. It could very easily have been made on a home computer. The sound quality is sloppy, the narrator is practically useless, and his pronunciation of Japanese words and names is bad. The information could easily have been read from any easily found website. The techinical value of this DVD is not worth thirty dollars. The value of the footage of Ueshiba, on the other hand, is priceless. If you haven't seen him in motion, you will find yourself deeply moved. I would recommend watching this one with the volume muted."
3,"Good singing, forgettable tunes","Rick Nelson has, I feel, one of the best singing voices I've ever heard, whether he's tackling rock, country, ballads or big-band standards. In THIS case, Ray Noble's ""The Very Thought Of You"" gets the same classy treatment as ""For You"" and ""Fools Rush In"" had earlier. However, on these 2 1964 albums, THE VERY THOUGHT OF YOU and SPOTLIGHT ON RICK, most of the songs are forgettable-- even as you're listening! Exceptions being ""Love Is The Sweetest Thing"", Chuck Berry's ""I'm Talking About You"" (a more laid-back version than the one Rick did on the 1972 GARDEN PARTY album), ""Don't Breathe A Word"" and ""Stop Look And Listen"" (though I prefer the version of this one done by Mike Sheridan And The Nightriders-- but that's me!). Once again, for Rick completists (like me!); for anyone else, I'd recommend Decca/MCA's THE BEST OF RICK NELSON: 1963-75."
2,"Convenient folded size, but unstable and poor quality parts",Pros: Small (when folded) and relatively light weightCons: Wobbly when fully extended. Poor quality (but expensive at $20) rubber feet disintegrated within 1-1/2 years of light use.I do not recommend
3,"Excellent design, no factory warranty-on your own","I like the idea of this product a lot. It is easily transported and I can easily carry it in the house for access to attic through closet ceiling access. The two round rubber feet crumbled in my hands after about 3 uses over a 15 month period. I had trouble contacting the manufacturer, but when I finally did they basically said too bad. They said that there was no warranty from Amazon and it was over one year. Either way I was on my own. They did however give me the part number for the angled rubber feet. I bought the new feet online from what appeared to be an authorized dealer for about $30 including shipping. The ladder is now safer and better than it ever was. Telesteps is still a loser company with terrible customer service. I reported them to the federal consumer product safety commission."
1,engineer,"The design was great; but the manufacturing was lousy. We bought one <4 months ago and have used it no more than 10 times in light duty conditions; one of the latches is already not locking, it appears that the black plastic ""gasket"" has slipped for about 1/8-inch, it can not be coaxed back in place. If you buy this product, make sure you register it with the manufacturer, you may need to make use of the 1-yr warranty."
1,"Nice Idea, Piece of Junk, Poor Service","These ladders are quite ingenious. A very simple plastic fitting and steel pin locks the sections together as they are extended, and they progressively collapse coming down. I've had 2. Each lasted about a month of very light use. Soon one of the locking pins won't engage and its useless. The first one I sent back and they sent me a re-conditioned one. Another month, the same thing. I've called. They won't give you a drawing of the mechanism to try and fix it or explain how it works, and all the pieces are press-fit so it's non-repairable outside the factory. They basically said ""too bad"". After taking it apart I can see what I might have tried for a fix, but too late. They really are unrepairable and the company was no help. Save your money. Too bad there is no ""0"" star rating."
1,#1205 telesteps telescoping ladder,This is not the original telesteps made in Sweden. It's a knockoff made in China. The marketing co. will tell you the patent was bought by an American co. This is a lie. There is no warranty and the real teleateps parts may or may not fit. The co. may have gone underground as they will not respond.
2,Poor Engineering,"I bought this ladder about 8 to 10 years ago to use in my business. Thank goodness I haven't needed it that often as after only a few uses, the plastic sleeves that align the sections started unseating causing the ladder not to be able to fully ""nest"". You can take off the feet at the bottom and pull the sleeves out until you get to the one that has unseated and gotten misaligned, reseat it, which is not always easy, replace all the others above, making sure that each one of them is properly seated, and it will then become useable again for a few more times, if you're lucky.The idea here is wonderful and when it works, it is a godsend. When it doesn't, and it didn't with increasing frequency, it is quite the opposite. I did buy this ladder quite some time ago and I would hope that this engineering flaw has been corrected."
2,Misleading Title,"For fans of Cleveland Amory's writings, this book is well worth reading. However, if the reader is expecting stories about Polar Bear, (for the most part) they are not to be found. The title would suggest that this book is the third in the series of the adventures of Amory and Polar Bear. Since I was expecting a continuation of the first two books, I was personally disappointed to find that the majority of this book was about Amory - with a great deal of his life long before he met Polar Bear."
2,"Too Much Amory, Too Little Cat","Amory's habit of name dropping and reminiscing, amusing in his earlier titles about Polar Bear, eliminates much of the charm of this book. The tale of his failed attempt to write a biography of the Duchess of Windsor was interesting, but it had no relevance whatsoever to Polar Bear the cat. His wandering thoughts on his relationship with Harvard was more petty than amusing. The condolence note from Ingrid Newkirk after Polar Bear's death is just plain creepy in light of some of the PETA scandals involving animal shelters. I'm really glad I picked the book up used at a fundraiser for my local library; at least my money went to a worthwhile cause."
4,Touching,"I discovered one of the Polar Bear stories in a very old Reader's Digest a couple of years ago and have since read the other two books in the series, this one (The Best Cat Ever) being the last. As others have said, I was disappointed that Amory wrote about more than the titles of his books promised, but I think that's because his stories about Polar Bear were so touching, so well written, I wanted more.But, I think because I had read the previous two books and got to know Polar Bear, the last couple of chapters of this book made me feel terrible, not terrible about the book but terrible for Amory, terrible because I've been in his place. I say, if a book can make me feel this way, it must be very well written.I debated between four and five stars. I settled on four because some of his stories that had nothing to do with Polar Bear bored me so much I just skimmed them."
1,Not so good...,"Okay, how one guy can write three books about his ordinary cat is beyond me (this book is the third in the series) but all I know is that he's a little too attached to this feline. Not that I don't love cats, I do. But I have to tell you that this book was one of the most dull I've ever read in my entire exsistence. Mostly it's not about the cat at all (which betrays the title). It's about the author. This old guy from New York who insists on telling us, as readers, every insignifigant thing that has ever happened to him in his entire life. No offense of course to this man (who I'm sure is very nice) but geez, this book definitly isn't for everyone."
4,Enjoyable,"Well written and keeps you interested. Sometimes the books, as with the others, just seem a bit short. Maybe needs a bit more details before"
1,Terrible!,"This video has an extremely bad quality. They say it is old footage remastered but even the words at the beginning that state that, are blurry and fuzzy. I doubt their disclaimer was remastered too. I was able to return it with no problem. I do love Amazon! Also, the package had to be signed for which UPS and I had a hard time connecting. However the original delivery date was timely. I also ordered a book from this company which I will rate a 5 star."
3,Another average reference book.,A very handy little reference book which gives the stories behind the big brand names in US business. It also give a short biography of the key players in business. Nothing spectacular but good to have on your reference shelf together with your dictionary if you want an anecdote or two in presentations! The references at the end are a useful bibliography.
1,WRONG PICTURE!!!!!!!!!!!!!,The image shown is of a 90degree bracket. The actual item is a 45degree bracket. I ordered four of these by mistake thinking they were 90degrees!!!!!!!! Now I'm out 7 days+ with my brackets!!!! GET IT RIGHT!!!!!!
3,"trance-inducing, but not for everyone","I really like this cd; my wife hates it. At first listen, it might sound like a tape loop that Hart lazily repeats for an hour or so. On closer listening, you hear the slight differences between one measure and another. The basic beat is a recording of Hart's son while he was still in the womb, so it's regular, but not mechanical."
4,Mellow Music for Labor,"When I went into labor with our son, my mom made the 6 hour drive to be there. She brought along an old old tape from my parents' collection-Music To Be Born By. Fortunately, my midwife's stereo had a tape deck! We played it for hours and hours as I labored. I have to say that it's very subtle, and most of the time, I wasn't aware of it playing. It just blended into everything that was going on for me. I really liked it because it was relaxing but did not distract. Afterward, my midwife commented on how much she liked it, so I ordered the CD as a thank-you gift for her."
1,Pure Krap,Such a waste of money. I would reccomend you buy just about any other CD than this one. It's the same 10 notes over and over and over and over and over again for over an hour. Why bother? I like Planet Drum and Supralingua but I'm trading this one in for store credit as a used CD though I hate to inflict it on anyone else. Blech!
5,Perfectly Enjoyable,The quality is good and the music is excellent. If you like international music this is one to add to your collection.
4,Not for the faint-hearted.,"I've been sewing off-and-on all my adult life, but I'm going to have to get my husband the engineer to help me draw up these patterns. Her method, copied from the original ones, is a multi-step project that appears to require some drafting skill in addition to sewing skill. Nevertheless, the original patterns of the era are scarce and painfully expensive and not user-friendly, so this is surely worth trying. Do not expect to whip these little numbers up quickly, however. On the other hand, who would ever want to make or wear most of the shapeless dreck in today's pattern books?"
5,FABULOUS,"I love this book. So beautiful, so detailed. I haven't tried drafting any of the patterns included yet, but the layout is great. My only complaint is how poorly it was shipped. Because it is a paperback my copy arrived with MANY bent corners and scratches and the only protection in the box was a couple of air pillows stacked on top of the items in the box. There was not a thing protecting the actual book. So I was pretty disappointed in that (I've had it happen to me several times with Amazon and am just surprised that more care isn't taken to ensure that the books arrive perfectly, the shipping boxes sure are nice) The book itself is really well put together and I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone who loves Edwardian fashion, even if they didn't sew."
4,"A Very Detailed, Dense Dissertation","This book is a very complete review of the use of astronomy in the early middle ages, tracing the links of classical theories to the re-birth of astronomy as a science in the twelfth century. The book is quite technical, and certainly is not for the faint of heart or those new to the concepts and origins of astronomical practice. It could use more illustrations demonstrating the concepts presented. The work is, however, second to none in its detail and cogent interpretation of primary sources."
5,great book for kids of all ages,"My grandchildren, ages 10 and 8, ask for this book at bedtime often and never tire of the story.When it was ""share"" time in the second grade class, I came in to read and brought this book. The class was delighted."
5,Yeah!,"My favorite western.check the great writers, blacklisted writers and actors in the early shows. this show was way before it's time. i dvr it everyday from the western channel.most old shows dissapoint...this is even better!"
3,"Have Gun Will Travel Season 5, vol 1","Love the series, thankful to have it available. That said, no additional material like in the first couple of seasons. Upset that seasons are broken into two parts, preferred singular package for season."
1,Over priced and poor quality,I had seasons 1-3 ant thought this would be a nice addition. Seasons 1-3 are good quality dvd and fairly priced. Season 4-5 are poor quality ripoffs. They split the season so they could charge double for the last two seasons. The volume goes from barely audiable to blast you out of the room. The dvd stop playing at intermittent points. A complete and total waste of money.
5,Paladin series from the 50's,"I never really watched this show when I was a kid, but my husband and I had a lot of fun watching these episodes on DVD. Good quality B&W."
1,Another two volume release for season 5,"The first 3 seasons were one volume, then season 4 had 2 volumes, and now once again season 5 will have 2 volumes. Corporate greed once again. 5 stars for the actual series, 1 star for the price gouging."
2,"nothing to compare with book 1, Whippoorwill",I didn't like it. I loved book 1. I do have a friend who said she liked it. Just not my cup of tea.
4,English Singer-Songwriter,"Tom McRae is an English singer-songwriter in the Damien Rice, David Gray, Nick Drake tradition. (He predates Rice, whom most resembles him, by a few years.) All Maps Welcome is his third release, and it continues a tradition of imaginative ruminations on lost love and the horrors of the modern world. He has an expressive, slightly high voice, used to great effect on ambient ballads (My Vampire Heart) and lowing midtempo numbers (How the West Was Won). His last CD, Just Like Blood, was a harrowing dead end -- impressive, yes, but limited in its depressive intensity. All Maps Welcome is more far-seeing, hopeful, with lovely new colors in the instrumentation."
4,Transition from Folk to Glam not always a smooth ride ...,"I see this particular album as a transitional one for David Bowie. Witness that it has several different versions of cover art and you'll see what I mean. ""Space Oddity"" sees Bowie moving from a coffeehouse Folkie type into the first steps toward his Ziggy Stardust persona. My two favorite cuts, aside from the title track, are ""Jeannine"" and ""Letter to Hermione."" The latter is a lovely ballad concerning Bowie's breakup with dancer girlfriend Hermione Farthingale; the former is a pop paeon to an obviously untouchable girl ""on the scene."" This is a good album in many ways, but the varying styles (thus my feeling that it's transitional) can be a trifle disconcerting at times."
3,A good album,"Older Bowie fans probably first heard this album after ""Hunky Dory"" and ""Ziggy Stardust"" when it RCA re-released it side by side with a reissue of ""The Man Who Sold the World"" to take advantage of his rising popularity. Aside from the timeless ""Space Oddity,"" this album probably came as a bit of a shock to those of us expecting something flashier (or, perhaps, spacier). Mostly acoustic, this album shows the influence of Bob Dylan on the former David Jones, especially in the epic ""Cygnet Committee,"" but that pretentious, though interesting track aside, there is much to recommend here. ""An Occasional Dream"" is a lovely ballad, ""Janine"" is a memorable pop song, and ""The Wild Eyed Boy from Free Cloud"" has an unusual western flavor very much at odds with most of Bowie's output. Though it doesn't compare to later, more ambitious works, this is a good album."
3,from humble beginnings...,"Contrary to popular conception, Space Oddity was not Bowie's first album. That honor (or indignity, depending on how you look at it) goes to an album called David Bowie.Nevertheless, Space Oddity is Bowie's first serious excursion into rock (barring the few tracks recorded for Deram that pinch rock cliches).The album is typically hippy, although Bowie has his tongue planted firmly in his cheek on some of the tracks, and he blatantly criticizes the hippy community on Cygnet Committee.Nevertheless, the album sounds like the soundtrack to a love fest circa 1969. If you like that sort of thing, you'll like this album. If not, at least you can revel in the irony of Bowie doing a psychedelic rock ablum."
5,Poignant,"Bowie presents here excellent songs about loneliness, melancholia, sadness. ""Wild-Eyed Boy from Freecloud"" is a pungent song, and Bowie in the flesh loves it. Major Tom is the best persona invented by him, and Space Oddity is a landmark, not only for Bowie, but for the whole history of music."
3,"A handful of possible Bowies at best, but likable...","'Space Oddity' is a rather frustrating, inconsistent affair, but a must-have if for no other reason than the elegant title track. Bowie was clearly still searching for his musical voice- mediocre tracks such as 'An Ocasional Dream' sit alongside Dylan-by-numbers like 'Unwashed....' and 'God Knows I'm Good'. But its surely not without its merits-the bad trip of 'The Cygnet Committee' packs a potent punch, and 'Wild-Eyed Boy From Freecloud', for all its Disney-esque orchestration, is passable. Buy it to complete your collection, and you'll find it grows on you."
3,Not Bowie's Finest Hour: Shades Of Things To Come,"Space Oddity is mostly a reissue of Bowie's debut album and the standout here is the song Space Oddity. Now and then we get the glimpses of Bowie's future brilliance, but not much. Most of the songs here are easily forgotten and better left for dead. Move ahead to The Man Who Sold The World for redemption. Still one of my favorite songs of all time, Space Oddity is a gem in an otherwise sea of semi-retarded sci-fi mumbo jumbo bullsh*t.Deal with it!"
3,I dearly miss the 1972 album jacket!,"Yo Bowie! If you bother to read what your fans think about your cds, I wish you would have kept the 1972 album jacket of ""Space oddity"". This cd jacket is bloody awful, a real turn-off. Now that the harm is done, you could make more money by putting the same product but with the 1972 jacket so that completists purchase both cds and people with more discriminating taste like me, throw away this ugly duckling and get their hands on the better looking 1972 ""Space oddity"" cd jacket.P.s.: The sound engineers made miracles on this cd. This use to be a cd you kept as a curiosity if your a Bowie fan, to be listen once and then store in your cd collection, never to see the light of day again. Now with the major improvements they brought to this lame duck, this product has gone beyon the ""good"" category, this is more like, dare a say into the ""sexy"" league."
3,A Good Album.,"Perhaps no masterpiece but Space Oddity Bowie's second release was a pretty good album. Good combination of Folk,Psychadelic and Rock. Although called Space Oddity after the first track on the album also Bowie's first hit single the album itself is far from being Spacey or strange. David obviously was very influenced by Dylan and others and he probably showed more his influence then himself on the album ( sort of like Lenny Kravitz) and perhaps that's the reason why so many music critics have overlooked Space Oddity ( originally titled Man of Sound or music or whatever). This album is by no means a masterpiece but it is good nevertheless."
5,Work as described,"With this only being a few dollars more than the ones that do not have the signal indicator light, might as well go with these. That way you know your system has received the IR transmission and it is easier to troubleshoot when needed."
3,Great tent - bad zippers,"Spent the first night in the tent in the backyard as a trial run before our camping trip. The tent went up fairly easy (needs two people, but with a 9-person tent it is easy to find one other person). Tent appears to be well made, like the other two Eureka tents we have. The problem is with the zippers on the doors. You have to be very careful or you will zip into the tent material. This happened in the middle of the night and when I tried to release the zipper, the zipped part above the zipper came undone. I had to go out another door. I fixed the zipper in the morning, but am disappointed that the zippers are not the same quality as my two other tents. I bought a Eureka, because of the quality I have previous enjoyed. I gave the tent a three because of the difficulty of zipping the doors. Otherwise I would have given it a 5."
4,Roomy and Easy to Set Up,"After the floor seam split during the initial set up of a Trailhead family tent, I purchased the Eureka Blue Mesa. Set up and take down was easy for just myself and my 7 year old Cub Scout.To date, we have only slept one night in the backyard, with no adverse weather. It's roomy enough for a family of five with gear. It seems to be well constructed and it's profile seems well suited to withstanding wind and rain. It will be tested by many Florida storms.I've sealed the seams, and will update on it's performance after it's first storm."
5,Great Cantle Bag,"This cantle bag it's simply: GREAT. I used it two times already and put 3 windbreakers in the main compartment. The sadle cover, located in the lower compartment it's a super practical feature that protects it during the rain. It also can be converted to backpack. The two bottles are a nice addition. Excellent product!!!!"
3,"""I'm Going To See A Man About A Chimney""","Thank goodness, there's finally something I can watch Jenny McCarthy in without having to justify to my wife why I'm watching. `Santa Baby' released in '06 is a predictable but enjoyable Christmas tale that the whole family can enjoy. Jenny plays the role of Mary Class, rising, no nonsense business executive who gets an expected phone call from her Mother on Thanksgiving Day. Her Father has suffered a mild heart attack and her presence was needed at home immediately.Well little did anyone know that home was in the far north in a little town named Polaris (i.e.: North Pole) and her real name wasn't Class, it was Claus, yep.. Mary Claus, Santa's daughter. Imagine if you will for a moment, Jenny McCarthy...I mean Mary Claus, coming to your house on Christmas Eve to fill your stocking. I guess Christmas isn't just for kids anymore!My Rating: Not a classic, but lots of fun and good Christmas spirit. The elfs are actually pretty funny: -3 Stars-."
4,Santa Baby,"I really enjoyed this movie. Jenny McCarthy played wonderfully in this movie. I'm a huge Christmas movie fan. I watch any Christmas movie i can. I really liked how she was all wrapped up in her own life,that she was to busy to worry about anything else. But this Christmas her mother calls her to come home. Her father is Santa and he's not been feeling well. So as Santa's Daughter she has to take over. In all of the mess she really see's all she's been looking for was at home the whole time. It really is an awesome movie. I would recommend to add to your collection."
1,Santa Baby,"I received this DVD and although I enjoyed the story line. The DVD came with Spanish Subtitles which I could not change. It was rather distracting to watch a movie with subtitles, since I am not Spanish... If I could have removed the subtitles I would have kept the DVD. When I called customer service they told me they all had Spanish Subtitles...So,I returned the DVD. To bad they did not let me know this info regarding spanish subtitles before I ordered the DVD.Santa Baby"
2,Beautiful picture color!,"I am really surprised to see so many good reviews. I like Christmas movies and I even like Jenny McCarthy, but this movie was absolutely boring. I am glad I got it from the library. It felt like a waste of time watching it. The colors in the movie are quite beautiful for which I give a 2, but the plot stunk. I don't even think the acting was, it was just not a good plot."
2,COULD BE BETTER!!!!,"Canibus has really good lyrics, BUT extremely WEAK WEAK WEAK beats. He has to get out of Wyclef's unit and go with someone who has crazy beats, for example: Daz Dillinger, Kurupt, RZA and dare I say Puff Daddy. He would be so much better there than with Wyclef. If you heard the song ""Fantastic 4"" by DJ Clue, featuring Canibus, Big Pun, Cam'Ron, and Noreaga, Canibus has crazy lyrics, as usual, and then he has the beats to go with it and he sounds so much better. My advice wait until the next album comes out."
2,Brace too short,"The brace holds the scaffold 30 inches away from the side of the building. I needed it to be at least 36 inches away from the building because the scaffold did not clear the width of my soffit. The brace should be longer, or at least adjustable."
3,"Does the trick, but could be better","I agree somewhat with the other reviewer - this brace should be longer to provide more space between the platform and the building. However, the brace works as it is supposed to, and if your trim doesn't extend too from from the outside of your building then the platform will clear. Also, attaching the brace to the house is a two-person job generally - one to hold the brace, the other to drive screws. This means you need two ladders at least as tall as your Pump Jack pole to set this brace."
4,Jack Brace,"The item showed up in excellent condition, if it would have arrived with some operator instructions it would have been rated a 5 star."
4,Very funny guy,"If you like baseball, and you enjoy a good laugh, you'll love this book. Bob Uecker is a very funny guy and has a world of stories to tell. Enjoy."
5,Funniest Book I've Ever Read,"I recently heard Bob Uecker speak with Vin Scully in the booth during a ball game. He told his signing bonus story and I determined then and there to find out if he'd written a book and if so, to read it. I'm very glad I did. I don't think I've ever had so much fun just reading a book. Uecker talks about his life in baseball and broadcasting. Pictures are included. You don't want to read this book when you are alone. You are going to need another person close by to whom you can read passages aloud. A book for sharing."
5,Mr baseball,Bought this book on a tip from some friends who said it was funny and boy were they right. Classic ucker
3,Bored to tears.,"I know he is well regarded in his time, and in Economic circles..However, the author of this book didn't do a good job convincing me of this fact as I was totally bored and unimpressed with Nash's accomplishments...This I'm sure is the fault of the author and not of John Nash..MJL"
4,"consumer warning, for fans of the movie","This book is a collection of Nash's most important papers in math and game theory. If you are just curious about Nash's life, there is little of interest to you here, except some photographs. If you are a scientist who wants Nash's most important work in one relatively cheap volume, this is the book for you. (Unfortunately, the book does not contain his hard-to-find article ""The Arc Structure of Singularities""--I suppose that one was considered ""incidental"" John Nash, or perhaps there were copyright problems)."
3,This is good but technical,"That is basically what I have to say. Look I'm no dummy and I'm a math major, but most of this is way beyond someone without a graduate degree in math. I managed to work out that the Nash equilibrium occurs in two space (I think) and that Nash embedding requires instruction in topology. I'm not saying it's not a good book, but it's a piece of work. Which is why I gave it three stars. The findings are important, the writing good, the commentary interesting, but this is over my head."
4,Essential... Academically speaking...,Valuable collection of Nash's articles and academic publications. Those who are just curious about Nash's life could be disappointed to find out that just a few pages are intended to fulfill non mathematical curiosity. The initial chapters on his biography introduces some of the most elegant mathematical demonstrations in game theory and pure math.
3,"horse is sweet, but colors are AWFUL","this is very inexpensive and FUN. but the colors are gross and don't even begin to match what is depicted. if you are willing to experiment with color mixing, you will LOVE this cute kitschy horsey."
1,Super Dissapointed,I was excited to find these photo corners because they looked very elegant from the pictures. When they arrived I was so dissapointed. They looked like I stuck black electrical tape on the edges of my photo.
3,"Good, but has problems","I like that these come in a box that is also the dispenser. The corners come out on a roll and you peel them off and then tear off the paper roll. Convenient. The bad part is the corners themselves are not all created equal. Only about one third of the corners in the box would fit flush on the corner of a photo. The rest wouldn't slide all the way because their edges were not crimped properly. So, your pictures ending up looking a little crooked. Plus, they look like cheap plastic. They don't have that classic, embossed look of the traditional corners. But, they are self sticking so you don't have to lick them like the old ones. So, they are somewhat of an improvement on the traditional photo corners, but they are also worse in some ways. So much for progress. In any event, if you are not too particular, these should suite you fine. But if are anal, then these may disappoint."
1,"Hard to use, corners are different sizes","Bought these photo mounts for a wedding guest book last minute. If I had time, I would have ordered different ones. The corners come in different sizes because they aren't cut properly. Because they are sticky, it is hard to put photos in them."
2,yuck,"If you are looking for good old fashioned type photo corners in an easy-to-apply format, this sure ain't it, man.One reviewer described the appearance ""like electrical tape."" Here in Maine: duct tape. Not pretty, f'sure.Others may like the slick, clean look. We don't."
1,Not as expected,Don't buy these unless you don't want to make a trip to Michale's crafts store or elsewhere. Poor quality and definitely not 250 corners in package. I've used 5 packs and got only around 1080 corners instead of 1250. One pack had bigger corners on one side and much smaller on the other. Many are sticking together and its a challenge to rip them apart. Bought more from Michale's they were cheaper and much better quality.
2,Merchandise was not all the same quality,"2 out of 4 opened boxes would not peel out properly, miss cut. I was really disapointed because I was hoping to finish up with an early Xmas gift."
1,I couldn't figure them out...,"I bought these to mount my photos and it was difficult to figure out how to get them onto the corner of the photo...by the time I got three of the corners on, my photo was covered with my fingerprints and the edges were curled up. Maybe I was too rough, or impatient, but,they don't seem very user friendly. I think I will toss them out! I was disappointed...I will use a tape runner from now on."
5,The best!,These are the best tabs on the market. They stick perfectly and don't draw your eye away from your photos and memories.
4,Perfect lens hood,"Just like you'd expect from a Canon product: excellent performance, but the price leaves a bit of a bad taste in your mouth"
5,just a novice amateur,"I don't know a whole lot about lens accessories but this lens hood seems to be everything I'd want out of a hood for the ef-s 60mm lens. It's solid, easy to use, and gets the job done!"
3,Works well but is too expensive for what it is.,"I'm not sure that I should have spent over $25 on this simple plastic lens hood. For macro work, flare is seldom an issue for me. I guess that its function as ""air bag"" lens protection may make the investment less painful some day if I manage to drop the camera or lens. ""Canon"" is an expensive word when it comes to accessories."
2,Not a cheap lens hood,"You gotta be kidding me. $28 for an OEM plastic lens hood? Canon must be making a killing with this.When I bought my EFS 60mm, it didn't come with a hood. So I gave this hood a try knowing that I was getting a ripoff from Canon. If you take macro pictures, the hood is kinda getting into your way. So I don't use it that often. It does, however, offer some protection to the front barrel of your lens. For $28, I suggest saving your money for something else. Perhaps a cheap Chinese alternative would do."
5,Lens hod received,Reecieved the lens hood iand is what it is i s as advertised by Canon and the Dealer..good deal..ok ok ok ok...
5,Best hood for this lens,After trying a cheaper hood I went to the OEM and should have done it in the first place. Don't waste your time with anything other than OEM.
4,Interesting on Several Fronts,"Annette Soylst's book on Morocco consisting of two parts (Story and images) is more than just a coffee table book.The book starts with a quote by the novelist Paul Bowles: ""I had been certain that sometime in my life I should come into a magic place which in disclosing its secrets would give me wisdom and ecstasy.""This picture book captures some of Morocco's magic in its lively text providing well-researched historical facts, interesting anecdotes and poetic descriptions of the country's cities and rural areas. The images portray the diverse facets of the country.The text and photographs have a timeless quality.This book is a must for fans of Paul Bowles and those who share his vision of Morocco as well as for those who plan to visit or have visited Morocco and need a souvenir of their visit."
4,Alternatative,"I considered purchasing this unit as well as the other comparable units listed on Amazon.com until I came across another unit while surfing ebay. I took a chance and purchased a complete tower unit consisting of 2 complete 6' scaffolds, outriggers and safety cage for $469.00 plus $150.00 in freight. The unit is well made and I'd put it up against Bil-Jax anyday at a fraction of the price. Contact kelly@scaffoldsales.com for more info."
3,Manu defect,"Would have given it a higher review if I didn't have to fix it first. Flex a lite put the motor fan assembly in upside down, reversing the blower. Works great....now."
5,REAL HOT Flex-a-Lite,Item produces sufficient heat as promised by company. 3 speed fan is NOT quiet on Med/High settings. The Install was more difficult than expected from company descriptions and user comments. Fitting for heater hoses required larger and smaller brass couplers than sizes stated on product. Am I satisfied with this purchase? Yes. I would say the install requires more work and know-how than Mfr suggested - directly or indirectly - through customer comments. This will vary with age/size/model of your vehicle.
4,Nice little unit,"Although it has not been installed, the overall quality seems to be good. Mounting directions/suggestions were not included, only the wiring directions."
5,Fascinating background information,I found this book fascinating. It filled in a lot of gaps in my understanding of Sri Aurobindo's background and the development of his Integral Yoga. I highly recommend it for the serious sadhak.
5,"A very good book, and highly recommended","I have read I've Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway several times since receiving it, and I have to say that it is one of the most powerful, moving tomes I have EVER read. Compiled from a series of articles written for his column, A Penny For My Thoughts, Paul Wein's book shows the thoughts and emotions of one who was there when the Twin Towers fell on 9/11, and I have to say that he does it very well. Without reservation or prejudice, I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to see a personal account of the tragedy that happened on 9/11."
1,Is this a photo Popup Book?,"Seriously people, is Paul a ventriloquist? Here a friend shows me this book. I say to myself ""oh wow someone actually wrote a heartfelt book for the victims, the families and others hurt by this horrible ordeal"".What I find is that this guy Paul Wein takes a bunch of pictures that have nothing to do with September 11th, puts some comments to each photo and next thing you know, he gets all his friends to write about how wonderful the book is.After doing a little checking I find it's vanity publishing? Paul, good writing is good writing. This is not. First you pay to have your work published, next you get your friends to write positive reviews and last but certainly not least, you dedicate a book to a friend lost, but the book is about who you met while giving them tours.Such a friend, glad I don't know you."
4,I've seen the man himself!,"After 9/11, there were a lot of books on the shelves of people who died on that day by their wives who were at home during all this. This book gives a first-hand account of what happened the moment it all went down, and what the chaos was really like in the streets, as well as the days following the event that changed the way most of us live. Paul puts his heart and soul into the book and really makes the reader feel that they were right there beside him, seeing and hearing everything. From the shock and numbness of witnessing the events, to dealing with the loss of a friend on that day, and how he has carried on despite it all, this book had me from the moment I picked it up. After meeting Paul this past year, this book helped me to understand his conviction for preserving his friend's memory and how he has dealt with all the tragedy he has witnessed since that morning."
5,Historical Perspective,"""I've Seen The Lights Go Out On Broadway"", Makes the reader feel like they were there on that fateful day and the days and weeks that followed. Even though Paul doesn't feel like the hero type, he is, in all respects. This book can and should be viewed as a historical account, with the exception that this book is a damn good read. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to know what it was like to actually be there when the towers fell. I enjoyed this book and hope his next work will be about happier times. Buy it, show it to your Grandkids so they will know about it and not forget."
1,Writing? Where?,"Well I see this is another person trying to use the towers to make a name for himself. I did a little research and found that Paul was a moderator for a few forums. So he certainly may have a following (hence all the positive reviews).But let's think here for a moment. Is his writing really that good? Is it Steven King quality (except of course, non-fiction)? Can he keep up with any other literary professional?I don't see writing, I see ramble.Sorry Paul I don't see the appeal."
3,Not their best version,"The Pioneer albums are wonderfully easy to use because they feature drop-in photo safe sheet protectors which allow you to use the many varieties of already decorated paper. However, on this version the spine is flimsy and once you add pages looks very cheap.Their Family Treasures album is a step up from this album and the expanding spine that allows you to add pages is a better quality than this version."
5,Journey Into Darkness,"""Journey Into Darkness"" is a remarkable first work. During the height of the Bosnia-Herzegovina conflict, the US found itself in the awkward position of trying to retrieve a computer disk that could influence the outcome of this ""situation."" They send in Bill Craig, a computer expert with minimal combat training. When he is trapped by an unexpected combat patrol, he is rescued by a young, pint-sized guerrilla. Through a series of adventures and missteps across the Bosnian contryside, Craig realizes the extent of his own involvement and the dynamics of this war.This book is a chronicle of one man's journey into darkness and another's struggle to overcome the crimes against humanity. It will tug at your conscience and your heartstrings; it will have you eagerly anticipating the next page, the next chapter. It will have you on the edge of your chair.So, settle down for a weekend of intrigue and adventure! You won't regret it! nfp"
5,This stuff rocks!!!!!!!!!!!,"Hey everyone,,,, this stuff is great. I have naturally curly hair that tends to get frizzy but when using this product I always have beautifully shaped curls, no frizz. The days I use this product I always get compliments on my hair :-)I am a customer for life,,, I also use the Matrix shampoo and conditioners!!!"
1,This cream is horrible.,"I have naturally curly hair so I thought I would try this cream. It did not curl my hair at all. When I was done drying my hair it was very dry. It may work for others, but not on my head."
1,not happy,"I found the product grainy and not the consistancy of the type I got through the hair salon. There were white balls in it and not in the salon product, maybe it was old."
1,Yucky goop,"I am a huge fan off the sleek look line, so I thought this might work well for my very curly hair. It did little for my hair except weigh it down with goop which made it look dirty, and I did not use very much.It just did not work for me."
5,Put's the DO in Do It Yourself,"I have been woodworking for many years and I have many books on various types of woodworking. I would count this book among one of the best. This book is not written by someone who is trying to impress himself by making the subject matter more difficult than it is. Instead, it is written by someone with great knowledge of the subject putting real effort into presenting his knowlege in a way that is easy for the reader to understand. Layout, design and techniques are all addressed with big, well planned, step by step color photos (not like some books that scrimp on the artwork and end up with horrible drawings or black and white photos). When you read this book, you will feel yourself saying, ""I understand what he is saying and I can do this!"" instead of, ""What the hell is he talking about! (I have plenty of books that will have you saying this)"". I wish all books about woodworking (or any subject really) were this comprehensive and beautifully illustrated."
3,"Pretty Pics, Spotty Advice","If you're interested in ideas for interior woodwork, this book offers some nice photos that may inspire a project ... and sometimes inspiration is just what's needed to get us out of the chair and actively working. However, if you're interested in executing the work that's shown, an inexperienced carpenter will be hard pressed to succeed based on the information here. No book can substitute for experience, and this book is great for dreamers, but there are better carpentry guides out there if you actually want to do the work."
3,"Yes, it is really a decorating book","Well, I should have known. The title ""Decorating with..."" tells it all. It is first and foremost a decorating book that the wife would love. This book has the best and sharpest color pictures of any decorating book and is very tastefully presented. But it is skimpy or just plain bad at helping you to DIY. There is little that is useful in technique and little that is useful for tackling the complexities of say installing crown moulding. But, I can't fault the author. After all, the title is ""Decorating with...""."
2,"good theory, limited facts","Mr. Silber hits the mark with his observation that today's trim is inadequate for big rooms and tall ceilings. However, while he addresses several styles of trim, he concentrates only on wall frames for technique. I'm a big fan of the prairie style and after spotting a reference to Frank Lloyd Wright in the Table of Contents, bought the book. I was most disappointed to find only 1 paragraph about prairie and nothing whatsoever on the size or shape of that style of trim (such as S4S). There were no suggestions at all for its installation - just one photo of one room in the entire book. I returned it. If you like the styles that use wall frames, this may be the book for you. Don't waste your money if you like prairie or Arts & Crafts."
3,Limited usefulness,"Somewhat disappointing, this book is not very cohesive. While some of what you need to know will be touched on eventually, the book uses a shotgun approach, hitting some parts of a subject and missing others. The book ends up more a showcse of some different types of trim, without really giving much good advice on how to actually select, cut, stain/paint, and install trim accurately. Check it out at a home store before purchasing."
1,Worthless,I bought this book for crown moulding. There was really no useful information in it....save your money.
3,Only one half of this collaberation was actually working here,"I've always found Dick to be a very uneven writer, The Man in The High Castle, A Maze of Death, and the short story Second Variety are brilliant, Galactic Pothealer was OK. As for the rest, I think his autobiographical work ""Confessions of a crap artist"" gives an honest accurate summation, a living proof of Sturgeon's Law (90% of everything is crap).Dick's contribution to Deus Irae was three already written short stories, and I think it is a measure of Zelazny's class that he can assemble something readable. I brought it mostly because I am a Zelazny collector, and class it more as an interesting curiousity. Buy 2nd hand rather than new."
4,Glyconutrients in a supplement form now..,"If you go to [...], you can check out a new line of products that goes in line with what is talked about in this book. I have bought every book out on the subject and found it hard to find something that could SUPPLEMENT... our diet... you never want to reply on a PILL to do that.. but, to help out.. this product by a company named COUNTRY LIFE, did a good job at mixing REAL FOOD, adding probiotics and then fermenting the product.. the company says then they add GLYCONUTRIENTS TO IT... I think it goes right in line with what this book is about and I was excited when I found the line...I wish this was information that we would see everywhere, how important it is.. but, we are just not there YET!!! :)"
1,Terrible light,Lens had scratches on it from packaging. Didn't like the way the LED's laid out in the light. Did not light up well. Mounting that goes into receiver is two pieces and made of plastic. Sent it back.
3,ONLY JUST OKAY,I agree with all the previous reviewers about this light. It is two piece plastic and the lights could have been arranged better and also could be brighter but it is adequate for its intended purpose.I have mine installed on a Corolla and it hits the ground when I go into dips or inclined driveways and now needs to be replaced as the last driveway destroyed it. It does break quite easily in these situations but it is cheap enough to get replaced so I intend to buy another.
4,Nice Light,It works and looks really nice. Good buy for the money. Would give it 5 stars but it seems to be very flimsy. Let's see how long it holds up. For what it costs no one should complain if it lasts a year. Donnie
3,hitch light,Light does as advertized. Fit receiver without altercation. Easy installation. Amazon's service was outstanding as usual but wish the light was brighter and could be seen better from acute angles.J. Jarvis
5,You can't beat the quality!,I have bought these for both of my SUVs. Quality is excellent and they do exactly what they are designed to do. 2 thumbs up!
5,"Powerfully intense, and involving music.","Although it may be tedious to some people, this CD is profound if you can give it a chance. Its particularly useful to relax to, and could be helpful for meditation."
5,Happy customer,"I really like this item a lot, play it often, feel connected to the monks, wanting them to flourish. The service to my mailbox was fast also. I'm a happy customer."
4,Freedom Chant,"Someone lent me Freedom Chants From the Roof Of the World on Cassette Tape. I do enjoy the Monks deep chanting however it was unusual to listen to at 1st as it is not something I've heard in our culture. #2 for Gaia is not a chant by Monks and is very beautiful to listen to, there is only instruments playing."
3,Okay for the price,"The belt, bracelets, and head wreath (all of the accessories) are very poor in quality. I'm satisfied with the tunic and cape, but overall I wouldn't buy again."
1,looks like Adorama might be doing the bait and switch,"If you are reading this review for the ""Deluxe Enhancing Filter Kit"" and the price is $29.95 this is not correct. If it is $60+ then ignore this review. Adorama tells me it was a technical error, but they have yet to correct it. This leads me to believe it is the old Bait and Switch technique. They sent me a different filter kit(cheaper). I now have to refuse or ship back this totally different filter kit to get my money back. We will see how that works out."
5,AMAZING,"I have only been using ceramic peelers since the 80's, but when i tried this MEGA peeler i was amazed at how much better the wider blad makes peeling.i have bought these for anyone i care about.this is a MUST HAVE for any kitchen"
3,May be OK,"To be fair, my problem with this peeler may result from my actions. I bought the peeler to use with the many butternut squash we grew this summer. The first time I used it, the results were terrific!! Skins flew off with almost no effort. It is advertised as dishwasher safe, so I put it in after I finished with it-and It hasn't worked since. It now cuts so deeply that I fear I will break the handle if I use it. Beware the dishwasher!!"
5,ROMANTICA,"I thought this CD was banging. I love when XTREME comes up with romantic music to sit back and chill with your man/girl. I always listen to XTREME, they have such wonderful voices together.Thanks,BoriquaCarpentersville, IL"
4,A good music group,"I purchased ""Haciendo Historia,"" since it has love songs which focus on real life scenarios -relationship wise. I would recommend this cd to girls and guys who enjoy music from a different sphere. The beat on all the songs is pretty much the same, doesn't change- though there are good selection of songs."
5,A fascinating wealth of information and lore,"Adobe Houses For Today: Flexible Plans For Your Adobe Home by Laura and Alex Sanchez showcases twelve plans for constructing compact, aesthetic adobe homes in modern and traditional styles. Chapters cover the history, advantages and drawbacks, and finances of owning an adobe home, as well as how to build one from the ground up. Black-and-white photographs, computer models, and diagrams clearly illustrate a variety of points. A highly recommended addition to academic and professional architectural studies collections, Adobe Houses For Today is more than a modern guide to an ancient architectural art; it is also a fascinating wealth of information and lore."
1,"These are her songs, but NOT the original recordings","These are Petula's songs, but NOT the orignal recordings. These are re-recordings done by Petula in the 80's to very different arrangements. For the seasoned fan, these are interesting diversions, but NOT nearly as great as the originals. I would NOT have purchased this CD if there would have been a track listing, which would have verified that these were the re-makes from the 80's.Suffice it to say that anything Petula sings is great. However, if you are looking for the original hit versions of HER songs, this is NOT the CD to purchase. I also understand that these are songs she does NOT receive royalties to, so you are not supporting Petula by purchasing this CD.Buy the BMG set ""The Ultimate Petula Clark"", ""Then and Now, The Very Best of Petula Clark"", or ""Supersounds from the Superstar"" if you are looking for the real thing. If you have the 'real thing' already, try ""Open Your Heart, A Love Song Collection"", featuring some of her 70's gems!"
5,This is a definitive teaching tool for parents and teachers.,"This is a simple, step-by-step program that can help parents and teachers teach any child with developmental disabilities to read. It is especially effective for children with Down syndrome. She uses concrete examples and pictures. I can't wait until ""Teaching Math..."" comes out."
5,Excellent resource,"I have used this book quite a bit with my 9 year old daughter with DS, since she was about 5. It is very well written and encouraging, full of information. I have given it to all my daughter's teachers as there are activities that can be done in a classroom."
3,Another Great book by Pat Oelwein!,Another great book I have used in my SDC classroom with low cognitive functioning special needs children. I would recommend it highly.
4,Helpful book,"I recently discovered this book in our local library and just had to order a copy for myself. As a teacher of several students with Down Syndrome, this book gave me great insight into how to help my students let me know that they could already read some words. I would recommend this book to teachers AND parents. The author reminds everyone who works with and loves these special children that they can learn and can do many things for themselves! I can't wait to finish reading it so that I can begin using the techniques and suggestions in my classroom."
5,A must-have for parents,"This book clearly explains the way children learn to read, from pre-reading to fluency. The side issue of learning how to write is also addressed. Note to parents: your child's teacher has probably never seen this book. Do the teacher and your child a favor by passing one on to them."
4,Audio A id,"I had been teaching a series to my congregation about the humanity of Jesus and how the earth and all creation recognized Him as He came walking onto the scene.I was searching for a particular song titled ""Thats Him"".Amazon had A cd listed with a song by that title,so I ordered it.This particular song was not the one I was seeking,but was perfect for something else I was working on at the time.Love Amazon--its the easiest site I know of!!"
5,A Hidden Corner of History,"Blewett has quite a story to tell, beginning with her childhood when she was briefly introduced to Hitler, to the pleasures of vacationing in Bavaria, to scavenging for survival in war's aftermath. More than a history lesson, the book chronicles the emotions within a particular family who began as members of the privileged class. Blewett gives us an unflinching view of people who disapproved of, but did not act against Hitler. Far from apologizing for German sins, Blewett shows the danger which made her mother look away from a train of Jewish prisoners, the regimentation which shaped the lives of her family, and the forces which cost them dearly."
5,"Haunting story - NOT ""just another"" Nazi narrative","I first read this book in manuscript form several years ago, and couldn't put it down. Margot Blewett's storytelling style is vivid, moving, and unforgettable. She tells a poignant and very personal story that leaves certain images and passages burned into your memory. This should be required reading in every high school."
5,A hidden corner of history,"I knew Margot personally in her later years of life through church, yet didn't know this much about her until I read her book. I was so moved by her story....and stunned by the hidden corners of what we commonly know about Hitler's reign.Her story is so compelling. I didn't put the book down until I'd finished it.I'm very honored to have known her, she died this week. RIP, lovely lady."
4,Great bargain compilation.,"You can never have too many compilation albums, especially when they are put together as well as this one is. 20 cuts of some blues classics by the giants of the blues and some great lesser known artists too. All at a fantastic bargain price. This is a nice introduction to the blues or a good addition to any blues fans collection. BB King, Howlin Wolf, Elmore James,Lightning Hopkins, and John Lee Hoooker will be familiar to almost everyone, but some of the other artists might not be, and that's what makes this collection worth picking up. With a running time of almost an hour you get far more music than many of the 10 song, 30 minute compilations that are out there. Get ready to tap your foot!"
4,The King!,"This album proves Wray only gets better with time. He stylizes the songs so well with pure heart. He is the king of rock, surf, metal, and all musicians playing similar music owe him a debt of gratitude and respect."
1,An honest assessment,"In far too many plans the rear of the design would not maximise the waterfront location. Many of these plans were just general ""holiday"" homes. The book is mis-named and I am just grateful that I did not pay full price for this unsatisfactory compendium."
3,"product is ok, cheap quality","I ordered this product for my album. This product has a cheap quality and once it stucked on something, it is really hard to take it off.(I ruined several of my photos because of this). But the good thing about this product is that it is easy to take, like a tape. would recommend."
4,Perfect!,"It is exactly as described. A little more than I wanted to pay, but it is exactly what I was looking for."
3,"Good ladder, but relatively cheap finger pinching hinges","Used mine for the first time today. Very happy w/ the solid feel, and the rubber feet are impressive. Kind of like construction or hiking boot soles.However those finger pinching metal hinges that are sure to get bent.Definitely not upset w/ my purchase, but would spend more money for solid, smooth operational hinges that lock."
4,VERY NICE,"T SHIRT BRA. I LIKE THIS FOR CLINGY TOPS, OR T SHIRTS THAT RUN TIGHT, A BIT SMALL IN THE CUPS, BUT, THAT IS HOW IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE. SLIGHTLY MOLDED CUPS........GIVES YOU A ROUNDED LOOK, AND ACTUALLY MAKES YOU LOOK SMALLER IF THAT IS THE LOOK YOUR GOING FOR....I LIKE THIS BRA, WEAR IT ONLY SOMETIMES, I ONLY OWN ONE.....AGAIN I AM HOOKED ON THAT BALI PASSION FOR COMFORTTHANKS"
1,False Legacy,"I have to warn Phantom fans away from this one. Raab's writing is tedious and wearing. In order to mimic old English writing, he simply went for awkward syntax that made reading this poorly conceived tale a true chore. Raab also re-writes the true origin of the Phantom so that the Phantom does not create any of his signature icons himself, but simply flounders into a ready made situation. This is a truly forgettable effort...hopefully."
3,Don't order two at once,"One of the dogs in the dogpark had a Ruffian octopus -- all the other dogs loved playing with it. It was very squeaky and so fun to fetch! They are great durable dog toys.Just be warned-- I ordered two: one for my neighbor's dog and one for mine. When you order two, you don't get two of the green squeaky ones you see on the ad. You get one green and one red. The problem with the red is that it has fewer squeakers and so is harder to ""squeak."" Bottom line, the dogs don't like playing with it as much. But, you don't know you're going to be getting two different kinds of ""octopi"" -- you think you're ordering two of the same thing."
1,Chewed it in 10 minutes,If you have a power chewer do not bother with this toy. He loved it but chewed its head off in ten minutes.
5,OEM phone battery - the way to go,"Why spend $30 at a Radio Shack if you can get it here for cheap? :) It's a battery after all, and there is fewer things in life that make you happier than a phone that doesn't die after a day.So, don't get a new phone and don't get a new subscription. Just get a new battery. And be amazed discovering all the features in your old phone that you didn;t even know about..."
4,Good system for the price,"Ive actually owned this system for 2 years. My parents have a cordless phone that needs to be replaced so I was going to buy them this system because I like the one that I own. Pros: good clarity, range, and battery life. Cons: When using the speakerphone on the handsets the volume level is not steady and tends to rise and fall. After about a year of use the labels under the bottom buttons have worn off(not that big a deal because I know what all the buttons do).Overall I would recommend this phone to anyone."
1,dct648,after owning these units for 2 years 2 of the handset will only let you hear the other person and not talk to them and of course they hang up. units are out of warranty and suspect 3rd unit will fail same way. would not buy again.
5,Absolutely wonderful..............,"After reading/studying this book you will understand the Bible more fully than before. Colors, numbers, names, events, etc. take on a meaning and understanding that highten, enlighten, and underscore the meaning and interpretation of the people, events, miracles, parables, metaphors, similies, and allegories contained in the Bible."
5,"Excellent, Insightful, Thought Provoking","This is one of the best LDS books on symbolism available. I love this book and have recommended it to friends and family.I won't repeat what the other reviewers have said, but I find that symbolism is very often overlooked in our ""quick fix"" society. This book helped me to get a different perspective on the scriptures. I had a new perspective on reading more interpretively. I agreed with most of the author's interpretations, but more importantly learned a new perpective which to interpret scriptures.Awesome!"
4,Almost perfect,"Fast shipping, good instrutions but the first time we used it the nut holding the crank handles fell off."
4,Pop Art.... The first album,"Pop Art was the first Official Transvision Vamp album. With 2 top 10 singles in australia and around the world. It was the album that put vamp on the map. As a result of this albums sucess, Velveteen was destined to be a sucess. Transvision Vamp were ahead of thier time and therefore didnot last as long as they may have. If this album were released today one would expect a much bigger audience, given the development of the alternative scene in the last decade.This is a great album, one tat can be played many times without wearing thin."
5,Schiller--Sonic Sculptors of masterpieces,"This is one of my favourite albums! And it is only going to get better! Their next full-length release is called ""Leben"" which will include vox from Peter Heppner of Wolfsheim (Again!Yay for Wolfsheim!), Sarah Brightman (who covers ""a beautiful day"" on her new release ""Harem""),The one and only Alexander Veljanov of Deine lakaien Fame,as well as Kim Sanders again and Mila Mar on the first single ""Liebe"". Pick up Voyage first, then the new one (out in October in Deutschland), and then Zeitgeist. Amazing music!"
2,A mediocre approximation of Enigma. At best.,"Perhaps if all the talking, and the word ""Schiller"" wasn't used so many times throughout the album I might have been more...generous... with my rating, but this self-aggrandizing stuff is usually relegated to hip-hop bling addicts, not electronica gurus.Not that I have any huge love of Enigma, but the first 2 tracks here might as well have been copies of songs from Enigma's first album....and not very good ones at that.Too much repetition, too canned-sounding, not enough inventiveness, and waaay too schmaltzy to ever be considered a contender.Great electronica creates effect without being obvious about it. This doesn't.(Sorry for the bad review, but I know mediocre music when I hear it.)"
1,A book with lots of sales pitches,"The Preface of the book talks about the offering that the author's firm is providing. I believe the book is just another sales tool for the author's consulting firm. It's filled with a lot of information that are irrelevent of (Wi-Fi) security. It poses a lot of questions without giving you the specific answers or solutions. Just take a look at the paragraphs under title ""Building a Private Wireless Infrastructure"" (bottom of page 88) and see if you can get what you expect from the title. I think this book is only good for either junior high school kids who like to know more about IT buzz words or those high-level executives who love to pay big money for thousand of words (not works) from the so-called consultants (It's not a coincident that the author's firm is called Executive Information Service)."
2,"Dated, not enough meat","This book served as the text for a graduate-level Wireless Network Security class. As such it was too elementary, and far too dated - one paragraph on 802.11i, none on WPA or WPA2. I got through the course thanks to Google, IEEE's website, and the Planet3 CWNA and CWSP books."
2,Waste of paper.,"The dated nature of the book is unavoidable without a reprint. However even in 2003 people knew better than to allow the errors this book contains. I found 23 different pages with serious errors. These errors could cause a novice to mis-configure their system or purchase inadequate hardware.More disappointing than the author's performance is the editors' poor performance. McGraw-Hill should be embarrassed by their involvement in this piece of work. The author is quite fond of ""due to the fact that"" and other flagrant poor usage. Additionally a good technical review would have caught the poor organization and inconsistencies of the book."
5,Clear and Complete,"I am really impressed with this book! WiFi has always been a difficult subject to master, especially with respect to security. Most of the books on this subject are very cryptic, however this book was very clearly understood by both myself and my colleagues. I highly recommend this book to ANYONE who is dealing with WiFi Security at any level."
4,Not as soft...,"...as everyone described, in my opinion. I paid about $4 for it and I feel it is worth that price, but not anything higher. It is soft, but it isn't soft like cashmere type, it's soft like... sponge. Worth the price for me, but the black one I got I really don't LOVE, just like. Maybe if I got one in another color, such as pink or red it would have been better."
3,cg190ce review,"A very nice guitar for the money. Give it a day or two to familiarize yourself with the wider neck and stretching of the fingers that comes with playing a classical guitar. The tone is sweet and warm. The body is beautiful and well crafted. The string action is a bit high on the upper registers but that is the only downside to this instrument. If you play the guitar through an amp that has high,mid and low settings turn them down to zero and use the the levels on the guitar's preamp to shape your tone.If you are staring at this guitar on amazon and wondering if it is worth the investment, I say place your order! You'll be glad you did. Robert Archibald"
5,adds nice color to photos,This filter adds a nice warmth to pictures taken outside and does pretty well inside as well would recommend this item
5,Grey Race,"""Give It Love"" is a stunning debut from a band that takes musical cues from the Beatles, Elliot Smith, and Radiohead, without mimicking any of them. Almost like a ""deeper"" Coldplay. Fans of melodic pop that leans towards the melancholy and dark with very rich but subtle orchestrations will be overjoyed. Strongly recommend this underground gem to any potential buyers. I have seen them live twice and they are the real deal."
3,Not bad for being recorded in a bedroom,"The singer-writer is Jon Darling, an ex NZ fellow who grew up with Cure, though it doesn't show. Darling, the bass player and drummer are all journeymen, and together with Darling's sister (and others) helping out, they have a pretty solid set of music here. It's all pleasant ballad rock, with quality hooks, though nothing really spectacular, and Darling's smooth mid-range voice. Studio fills include keyboards and strings. Unfortunately some of it borders on lounge at times (""Cracks""), and there isn't a real hit song, it's best as a background wash. With others doing similar things, but with much more thrilling melodies (CVS, Steven Lindsay and Ryan Ferguson for example), that makes this CD pleasant, but not essential. Oh well, at least they all have other jobs."
1,Big Disappointment,"I purchased this product because i have a bunch of 8.5x11 photo prints and this album was the only one that I could find to display them. The only drawback was that the album came initially with only 10 inserts (20 pages) counting front and back)and so limited the number of photos I could display.No problem I thought so when I purchased the album, I also purchased a set of additional pages and the post extensions you need to fit them in. Imagine my disappointment when I tried to unscrew the caps from the initial posts and found that they turned and turned but would not unscrew. Not easily discouraged, I tried for hours and hours but still no luck.And when I complained to the sellers of the album, my complaint was ignored. So sorry but this purchase was a bust!Pioneer 11 3/8-Inch by 11 3/4-Inch Postbound Deluxe Boxed Leatherette Magnetic Album, Black"
2,Pioneer Scrapbook,"Just a little disappointed with this scrapbook. It was just what I had wanted, but it was warpped and bowed in the middle when I got it. I liked the way it looked like leather."
4,Pioneer Phot Album,Excellent service & quick delivery. Was just what I was looking for to store and organize our family photos that have been sitting in a box for years.
2,Pioneer 11 3/8 inch by 11 3/4 inch photo album,"Well, this photo album is great for newspaper articles, but if you change your mind, it will let a mark on the background as soon as you take away the newspaper article. If you use it with photos only, it is great because you can change them without damaging the background and you can compose freely your display with good spacing. For photos, I would have given 4 stars.The downside is also the price. Too expensive!"
5,""" This Disk Will Blow You Away In 56 Seconds! ""","Jim Brock's Tropic Affair is one of the best jazz/fusion CD's I have come across in the last year. Great from beginning to end and one of the best Latin influenced recordings I know of. When I first played this first rate, quality recording I was very impressed with an almost Eumir Deodato like sound that it has. I suggest you turn your stereo down to a safe level before you start rockin out! It's very dynamic. You won't be disapointed. I have heard Jim Brock has made recordings earlier than this one. I sure wish I had them! I can't get enough of the incredible arrangment and quality musicianship on this disk. Keep them coming Jim!"
4,Jim Brock,"i like it a lot, the recording is very clear. However there are only a few selections that I like."
2,"Some humor, mixed in with ethics and preaching","Not the best book if you are looking for cheap laughs (if so, try Jenny McCarthy's books). Interesting combination for humorous anecdotes with moral stories. It is a feel-good book - It tells you that you are doing just fine, even if you are imperfect."
5,a great cd and wonderful service,Thank you for the wonderful service in getting me this cd you are why dealing with amazon is such a pleasure the cd is a wonderful addition to my collectionthank youdarylee michlink
4,A solid introductory work,"I have grown to appreciate this book over the past five years. Although I do not use it myself much anymore, I do assign it to my Archaeology 1 tutorial students. It's an easier read than 'The European Iron Age' (John Collis), and I prefer the layout and illlustrations of 'The Ancient Celts' to 'Exploring the World of the Celts' (Simon James).I would very much recommend this as a first text for those who are interested in the archaeology of the Celts. It's very well-written, and the illustrations are highly evocative.However, as with any single-author account covering such a wide geographic area over such a span of time, there are disagreements over some aspects of Cunliffe's interpretations. Because of this, I would suggest that 'The Ancient Celts' is probably best read in conjuntion with either of the two books mentioned above."
2,Mostly an archeological textbook,"Although this book has a lot of interesting information and photos, it it so tediously written and so focused on specific archeological finds that it was very disappointing overall. There was very little ""overview information"" about the Celtic lifestyle. If you want a lot of archeological detail this book is for you. But if you are looking for a more general book with information about the Celtic lifestle you will never make it through this textbook-like work."
5,"Wonderful, and ground-breaking","Wonderful book, Cunliffe is a well-known scholar who's an expert on celtic archeology, and has been in numerous television shows and documentaries. Wonderful author, well written, and indepth. He shows you the archeology, and what it could've meant, but leaving enough room for you to draw your own conclusions. I loved the chapter ""Religious Systems"" as it's very informative, and solid in the archeological record. Love it, love it, love it. I fully intend to re-read it next year to see if I re-learn what I've learned. There's just so much information in this book, that it warrants another read!"
3,Good photos bur disappointing contents,"The pictures are beautiful, showing many unusual pieces, but the content is often only school-book level, with little in-depth analysis or contextualizing. I found myself wishing for more information, and a deeper, more serious treatment of the cullture, the beliefs, and the everyday life of the people."
2,Old-fashioned and uninteresting,"Cunlife's work, though a good introduction to the Celts, is elementary and old-fashioned. He doesn't address the real issues in Celtic archaeology. I would recommend 'The Celtic World,' with its variety of authors and subjects, as a much better synthesis of modern archaeology for the serious student."
2,Fluff piece,"If Eros in Hell has whetted the appetite for another cursory glance at Far East films, then Lee Server's book is for you. A well-written and dazzlingly laid-out book, Asian Pop Cinema is chock full of information for someone with little or no knowledge of Asian film. For those who've seen a smattering of Woo, Yimou, or Kurosawa, this book offers little information that isn't common knowledge among Eastern cinema fans. Like the films of Tsui Hark, Asian Pop Cinema looks nice but doesn't offer much entertainment. (ISBN: 0811821196) -"
1,Sad about this,I was very excited to get this but it arrived broken. The cup on top is broken and seems to be made with different paint than the vase part. It's not glossy at all like the rest of it. I can't position this in a way that hides the broken side and definitely cannot use it with the broken piece.
1,broken,Sent for it twice came back broken both times. Decided not to try a third time. Was very disappointed since this is the first place I found this item.
3,"Disappointing, but demonstrates writer's growth (having read this AFTER his more recent efforts).","I read this novel after I'd enjoyed the author's latest efforts. This particular novel suffers from being overwritten and lacking in compelling insights into the characters. Also, the ending was disappointing."
1,"TOO bad, should have spent more on the script.","Wow, glad I rented this. I decided the movie wasn't worth my time to finish. Love the first movie. TOO bad."
1,you were hoodwinked if you watched it.,"I saw the trailer and I would not pay my last quarter to see hog-wash like this. The trailer to this movie is a compilation of childhood short stories like Pinocchio and Little Red Riding Hood and so on. I thought that the comedy gags in this trailer just about gagged me. This movie is junk (to use a single syllable non-swear word). Don't watch it, don't buy it, don't rent it."
2,Dissapointment,"Wracked with stereotypical personalities and a boring storyline, I couldn't even make it through the whole movie (about 3/4 of it before I quit). The humor from the first one is gone. The writing was flat and dull. I wanted to like this one, even a little, but the magic that made the first one work just wasn't there."
3,The kids liked it....,"I'm writing this as an adult that is not a huge fan of kid movie sequals, but i got this movie for my kids because they liked the first one so much. I, too, enjoyed the first Hoodwinked, but Hoodwinked Too was not the same quality as the original. I can't say its ""awful,"" but I'm glad I waited to see it on video. I would have been disappointed had a paid theater prices for this movie. I have to say though the kids enjooyed it and laughed where they were supposed to do. I'm sure I will see it on my TV again here soon. :)"
2,Too Bad........,"The plot in this movie was short....but hey its a kids movie.What I didn't like about this movie is how the Characters lookdifferent from the original movie...They're to bolgey, and thecolor of there eyes are different, and for some reason the charactersseem less funny to me, I dont know about anyone else. But if youwatch the first movie you'll understand."
4,Quick shipping...,Blu-ray arrived in a timely manner. Haven't viewed yet though. Waiting for some friends to join me. Then the party will begin.
3,Item never arrived,"because I ordered this through the Vine program, Amazon would not send a replacement. :*(Sounded like a fun movie, but I'll never know. Good luck to you."
5,Unexpectedly Funny & Entertaining,"We watch a LOT of movies. If you can reasonably pass it off as a kids movie, we go to it as a family. We have three kids that range from 4 to 11 years old. They have already watched this move 3 times. What else do I need to say?We normally only watch movies like Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, etc that many times. But this is a very entertaining movie for all of my kids and even me.I'm actually surprised that I don't remember this being in the theaters because it is easily as good as movies like Gnomio & Juliet. Perhaps it went directly to DVD..."
4,"Kids love it, the adults not so much","I understand this movie is geared towards the kid and as such seems like a good movie. My kids, 3 and 4 years old, both really like it. It seems that many of the kids movies today have found away to keep the adults entertained with some more subtle humour, while also making sure the kids are loving it. This movie didn't quite do that for me, which I don't think should count against it. It isn't about to replace Tangle as my daughters favorite but has certainly jumped Gnomeo and Juliet for her on the DVD pile."
4,This was cute,"I watched the first movie (Hoodwinked) before this one and I thought they were both really cute. These are kiddy movies with enough funny moments to keep Mom and Dad watching too.I love the way that the same occurrences are shown from several perspectives to explain how things happened. The voices were done by actors who were clearly having a really good time.All in all, these will be keepers that I will watch when I want a bit of fluff to laugh at!"
1,I was hoodwinked,Terrible sequel. All of the humor and wit of the original is gone. Parents save the money and put it in your kid’s piggy bank.
2,subpar,after the quality of the first one this one was subpar. it was a major let down. The characters were taken away from what made them special in the first one.
1,Huge Disappointment. Nothing like the first movie.,"Huge Disappointment. Nothing like the first movie. Animation was awful--wooden--cheap! I liked Anne Hathaway's voice better as red, the new girl doesn't fit the character. The writing was terrible. Ugh. Martin Short as Kirk was a waste of valuable finances that should have been put towards animation and hiring Anne Hathaway.... Oh, and why is Joan Cusack still around? She is barely tolerable with her brother carrying her, but by herself...just go away. Glenn Close barely sounded like Granny--lazy! Red's poorly animated face annoyed me even more so then her new voice. I had high expectations of this movie, being a huge fan of the first, but they just destroyed the whole franchise."
1,NO SDH on 3D version!!!,Subtitles for the Deaf and Hearing Impaired (SDH) do not exist on 3D version... Seriously! The producers of this product believe that Deaf people should not be allowed to enjoy 3D visual effects? Why? Because they can't HEAR? Major mess up on the part of the producers ability to reason who should be allowed to enjoy visual effects!!!
1,Hoodwinked... This should be called Bamboozled!!,"In short, this movie was absolutely horrible!!! The plot was thrown together, the effects were awful, and I payed extra to see this in 3D. At certain points in the film, the characters words were not going along the their mouth movements. This is 2011, if James Cameron could create a movie like Avatar, these people could have done a better job with the animation of this movie. Don't waste your money or your time."
1,Unbearable,"Our family liked the original movie and had high hopes for this one as well. Unfortunately, this movie was nearly unbearable for the adults in the room to sit through. The kids even observed that it wasn't as good as the first version. I never cease to be amazed at how much money can be wasted on worthless garbage in the movie industry...yuck. You would have to try to make a movie this bad."
2,disappointed...,"This sequel is not nearly as witty as the first movie. Kids 8-12 might enjoy it, but it doesn't have the sense of humor needed to maintain an adult's interest."
2,Potential to be a hit but missed by a wide margin,"I never saw the original Hoodwinked so perhaps that might skew my review slightly as I'm looking at Hoodwinked Too as it's own film and on it's own merits.There is a great cast of voice actors in this movie, and like a lot of animated comedies there are fleeting references to other movies woven into the plot all along (like the bunny's take on Hannibal).With the absolute wealth of possibilities here, taking the childrens classic fairy tale characters and spinning it, along with the talent on offer, this should have been a good, funny animated movie, unfortunately it misses on so many levels.The characters aren't really that engaging, the story isn't engrossing and the comedy is barely there at all. I found it hard to get into this movie and to be honest found it hard to watch all the way through to the end.As such I can't recommend this movie to anyone. A shameful miss."
2,Grandmother Productions?,"The heroine of this animated feature is a little girl in quest of purloined bakery recipe with magical powers. The film is extremely repetitive as though one is constantly watching slightly revised loops of the same scenes. I watched this with another adult, and Hoodwinked Too! barely held our attention. In fact, I almost nodded off to sleep because I found the film uninteresting. The grande dame of the film is a wry and wise grandmother. Perhaps youngsters would find the film more captivating than two adults did. There were a few violent episodes, which may deter some parents.Hoodwinked Too! is a far cry from recent classics of animation, such as Up ( [...]"
1,"Please, take time to read, just facts, not just ""my"" words/view.","Umm, glad someone enjoyed it with kids, about the only way to do it, but its rank. I hate to bash, I am only here because I want to warn others, it is bad! I am not comparing it to the first, or other movies, it stands on its own as thin and not worth any amount of money. If you watched the first I bet this movie had some appeal to see the characters again, but that would be about it. I have never seen so many cliché sayings in a movie (even those doing it to poke fun of those) but this one was stale with so many used over and over from the past. Fast paced so you don't get bored or realize there is no content, or story line or good character content. And last, first time the wife agreed with me; the movie was poor. Don't often do this (ever?), but this disc is being returned!"
1,Big disappointment,"The original Hoodwinked was a masterpiece. It used the tail of red riding hood to present the concept that a person might look one way on the surface but the truth can change on deeper inspection. I thought it was a GREAT movie to teach the concept of not judging until you have all the information. And it was done in a fresh and entertaining way.Hoodwinked Too didn't have any point. It didn't go anywhere. It had no real underlying story to tell. It was just a pointless mish mash of plagiarized scenes from Spiderman 2, Star Wars (pod race), The Incredibles and others. About 5 minutes into the show I started thinking 'This is boring. I hope it picks up.' It did not.Like other reviewers I had liked the original so well I was looking forward to the sequel. They must have fired the original writers. This is a looser."
2,Digital Copy Problem,"Be careful, the digital copy will only work with a US iTunes account. I tried it with a Canadian one and the company says it will not work outside of the US.This movie is not nearly as good as the first one. Still an OK and family friendly movie but a bit disappointing."
3,Well it's not for Me..but,"I agree with some of the other viewers. This movie was not as good as Hoodwinked. and sometimes there are problems with sequels, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. My nephews seem to think it was pretty funny. It kept their attention. (so glad it wasn't longer..because maybe they would get antsy)It's not for ""family"" but it is a great little dvd to pop in on the road, or to busy them for a while why you do housework. I am pretty much convinced though that after they have watched it a few times, you may as well throw it out."
3,OKAY,"This movie was okay at best. I watched the first one and I thoroughly enjoyed it. However, I suppose my expectations were a bit high for the second one but the movie didn't live up to my expectations!!!"
3,Hoodwinked Too!,"It's a sequel & of coarse it was no where near as good as the origional. The story was alright, but not as creative as the 1st."
3,Took what worked from the first movie and went a little too far with it,"Hoodwinked Too! was just a little too over the top for me. It was fun, worth watching and the kids enjoyed it, but I think they just tried to cram too many jokes and references in. It became a disjointed mess that just was barely held together. Since I'm not expecting Citizen Kane when I sit down to an animated movie with my kids, I can forgive the insanity and chalk it up to a fun evening, but I would not say this was a ""good"" movie. Stick with the original Hoodwinked (MUCH cuter and reasonably packed with plot)."
2,3D blinks in and out,"I bought this Blu Ray 3D to add to my small collection and thought somethig was wrong with my glasses as it kept blinkig in and out of 3D..I had the secod pair of glasses that came with my setup that had never been used,put in he battery and started using that pair and uggg same thing..This movie is not a good 3D blu ray as it seems to have been recoded in 3D and images would half the time be 3D and others not =( very annoying IMHO!! Would only recommend if you want to buy a really cheap 3D blu ray or wanted it for little kids since it comes with 4 copies for less then $15"
3,Middle of the Road,"My husband and I enjoyed the first Hoodwinked movie when it was first released several years ago, so we were interested in this one. I was also interested in the fairy tale usage since that is what I do. All the same, we sat down with the primary purpose of being entertained. I somewhat was, but not enough to put down my laptop and get really involved in the film, so I probably missed some visual puns. While this had some cute moments, it didn't have the same heart or cleverness of the first movie. I don't expect much from movies like this and I have some kids in my life who will have fun with it, so it gets a middle of the road three stars. Yes, there is lots of cheese whiz and silliness but most of it was obvious, expected, once the humor was established. Still, I was amused at times and it was fun to see some lesser known tales make an appearance, too. Now I want to go back sometime and watch the original to see if it is as good as I remember it."
2,Not for me.,I really didnt like the first hoodwinked movie but I thought I would go ahead and try out the second one though. I wouldnt waste your time on this. It has alot of adult humour and situations that I really didnt want my kids to watch. I know that I find my family watching more family oriented movies but this one really didnt work for me. the animation was great and it did have some funny parts but the whole thing didnt work. I guess that was why this is rated PG and for good reason. Overall I would stick with other cartoon movies for your kids. Some humour and stuff is fine but too much is not a good thing.
2,"Ho-Hum, the humor is kind of mean","I watched this once and wasn't too impressed. I did not see the original so didn't know the back stories, but I still felt like I knew what was going on. Nothing jumped out as being good, however, as a mom, I don't think I want my son watching this.Hood goes into training with a group of women known as ""Sisters of the Hood."" There's women there of all ages but there is one old lady who seems to be the comic relief. As in, a rolling pin hits her and that's supposed to be funny. I'm not sure why, but it's supposed to be. Then later on she falls (not sure why, maybe something else hits her) but then the head lady steps on her. Hard. In fact she walks all over her. It's like she did it purposely! Why is being mean to an old lady funny? Is there a back story in which this old lady did something that I am unaware of? I didn't like my son seeing this kind of behavior. Which actually worked out well because even though we saw it once, he never asked to see it again."
5,Hoodwinked Too,"I have been waiting for this to come out since I saw the original it has been well worth the wait, very funny"
4,A wonderful guide at a difficult time.,The book is a gift for those who have suffered a loss. A great reference book with checklists that helps a widow go through a trying time. From finding agencies that can help financially and emotionally. The book aides in adjusting to and recovering from the loss of a loved one. It helps you become independent or independant again. It is an inspiration to continue on with your life.
5,YOU CAN'T STOP OFFICER ROSELAND,"OFFICER ROSELAND HAS THE CAPABILITIES TO BE WEENS' BABY BROTHER. THE SELF TITLED ALBUM IS PERFECTION, NOISE, BALLADS, APPLE ZIPZAPS, EVERYTHING. I'M NOT AS THRILLED ABOUT ""SUNGLASSES"" BUT THE MORE I LISTEN TO IT THE BETTER IT BECOMES. IF YOUR A WEEN FAN YOU OUTTA APPRECIATE O.R. CHECK OUT GRAND BUFFET AS WELL. WHO SAID PA. ISN'T TALENT FILLED."
5,"Fine old carols from the English tradition, well recorded","This album has many of the best traits of high English culture -- understatement, reverence, a sense of history -- and yet little of the stuffiness. It's wonderful, warm holiday music, neither sentimental nor solemn. It works very well as background to holiday gatherings, yet rewards close listening, too. I'm no musician but I agree with my friends who are: the Royal College of Music sings these fine old carols as well as anyone. The recording quality is excellent, too. This music is not vibrant, toe-tapping, or modern, but I can't think of anything I'd rather listen to after a big holiday dinner, appreciating the peace of the season. I especially recommend you go outside on a December night with this on headphones and crunch around in the snow. You might believe you're in a Dylan Thomas story. You might want to move to 18th-century England. You certainly won't be sorry you bought the CD."
5,"Well written, well researched, great fun","Sherill Tippins has written masterfully of the lives of many of the mid-20th century artistic luminaries from both sides of the Atlantic who gathered in a newly formed group house in Brooklyn Heights and found inspiration and encouragement in launching their various careers. Each character is well developed, and Tippins leaves no loose ends in informing readers of what happens to each. It is no surprise that so many of the subjects were gay. However, to a 2013 reader, it is interesting to see how many of these persons nonetheless felt social compulsion to have opposite sexed marriages for business or social purposes. A really great read. House founder George Davis was a gifted talent scout and impressario in bringing together this group."
5,Fascinating Time Capsule,"A wonderful book! Reading it is like taking a time capsule to a pivotal and fascinating time (1940s prewar Brooklyn) in history: political, social and artistic. Each character is so rich, and their interactions with each other so convoluted artistically, sexually and as friends and housemates. Sherrill Tippins has done a great job of bringing the house at 7 Middagh Street in Brooklyn to life. The pacing, the tone, the details, everything is just right. Having lived in a somewhat similar group house in Brooklyn much later on myself, I found so much that resonated. I read it slowly and savored every page, closing it at the end with a nostalgic sigh. I'm sure this is one book I'll reread--perhaps several times!"
5,a fascinating read,"I heartily enjoyed February House by Sherill Tippins. The exploits of the disparate cast of characters make for a fascinating read. The details about Gypsy Rose Lee are particularly intriguing. Who knew she wrote a book called ""The G-String Murders""? As for the Bowles' bedroom games, well; you'll have to read the book to find out."
4,I've had the stainless steel distiller for years,"I have no idea how long I have had my distiller. I know I got it prior to 2003 to rid my water of chlorine and fluoride (I have hypothyroidism) so it would be at least six years if not more. In all that time, it has never given me a moment's trouble. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because of the plastic container. It hasn't leaked but I've wondered if it is really safe. I would buy the glass one to replace it (even if the spout didn't exactly match) but the fact that it's flimsy, fragile and somewhat open turns me off that. In the meantime, I fill the distiller with a separate pitcher so as not to contaminate the container and run it several times a week. After it has cooled, I put the water through a Brita filter to remove any ""off"" taste that might remain. I have been very happy with this distiller. Its ease of use and affordable price can't be beat."
1,Skip this distiller,The water this unit produced tasted and smelled like plastic. I rinsed the holding container like suggested with baking soda and it didn't help. The unit is noisy and takes 4-5 to complete distilling a gallon of water.
4,ROBS MINERALS,Distillers rob essential minerals from water. But this can be remedied by adding a pinch of quality sea salt and a squeeze of lemon (per gallon) to the water after it has been distilled.
2,"After 2 years of service, bottom of distiller rusted and leaked into electrical base.","We enjoyed our distiller for 2 years. We used it about twice a week. Recently, the machine stopped after distilling water in the middle of a cycle. It did this several times before I took the top off, removed the screws, and cleaned it (but it wasn't very dusty at all). It still shut off shortly after starting the cycle. I then took a closer look at the base unit. When I lifted it, I was surprised to find that it was so heavy. When I tipped the base, water poured out of the outlet for the plug--not a good sign. I looked at the bottom of the stainless steel (?), and found dimples at the welds. There was evidence of rust around one of the welds, and a pinhole crack. I'm disappointed that we didn't get more use out of this machine."
4,Very useful,"I am very happy with this unit!!!! The unit has given me clean water!!!! I have no problems with the glass collector!!!! It is worth the money!!!! Only disadvantage is it only makes one gallon. One needs more containers for more water. This amount gets used up quickly when I make coffee in my percolator, which is also stainless steel.One other problem is the PLASTIC lid for the collector jug. I do not use it, I use a ceramic plate instead. I dislike using any plastic. Other than this it is very good."
5,It was operator error,"I had a problem and sent a note to Amazon, the company called and was very helpful....it was ""operator error"". I love the distiller and once I figured out how to really work it, it is just fantastic!!! I love it!!!"
5,The title of this album is fitting!,"This is a must have CD for those who love inspirational Gospel music with the power of soul. The Reverend James Cleveland was a one of a kind minister who had the abilities to rock the organ, piano, and church! The songs on this CD are explosively good. I missed a lot of them, and sure am glad to have them all on CD and on my MP3 player. I play them EVERYDAY! It sure is needed in these days of turmoil and trouble."
5,Not about meetings only,"Scott Snair wrapped an almost complete management guideline into the book which you can use even if you're not a manager. He blames meetings as many of us does, but he points out their weaknesses, so if you really have to hold a meeting or participate, you have the armory to minimize the time-wasting. In addition, he provides an approach how to live without meetings, including more personal communication, taking explicitly responsibility for things and mentoring.I tried out some of the methods and they work. Granted, they require more work on the manager end, but provides more efficiency for everyone.If you spend more than 5 hours per week with meetings, you must read this book. Otherwise you should :)"
4,"Less talk, more action: A guide to better communication, heightened productivity, and fewer meetings.","VERY EASY TO READ !! GOOD MANAGEMENT ADVICE !!Methods outlined in this book:Improve a manager's ability to gather inputStreamline the communication processMake influencing key members of an organization much easierIncrease productivity, without stifling openness and job satisfactionMake managers more ""hands-on"" by using responsibility as areward.Contents:Stop Surrendering to MeetingsRecognize What Doesn't Work and WhyDiscover the Lost Art of One-on-One ManagementEmbrace the Role of Team LeaderGet Comfortable with DelegatingGet a Mentor, Be a MentorAvoid the Meetings of OthersKnow the Ways to Cheat"
4,Satisfied,"Daughter purchased for me. I have a Victorian home with 11.5 foot ceilings. Needed the work buddy to work on ceiling moulding, add a ceiling medallion, and then wallpaper. I weigh about 250 lbs and leaning on a step ladder is tiring. Refering to previous review I always got on the top plank setting by using a step ladder. Never had any trouble standing at either end. Found very stable. Helped me very productive. Would recommend for this type work. Wish there was an accessory to rest tools on. Had to make my own and attach it to end ladder. Dave Barton"
4,Another look to tango,"Easy to understand, hard to do...You have to change the look to the tango rules:Posture,balance,leader,follower,steps,etc.Actually,there are so many rules which make us forget about the truth:Maybe it is better not to challange our nature.We are trying too much to adapt what we have been told and loosing how to enjoy the music and the dance.Being relaxed is coming after reading this book...So,I mean,nice work."
1,Borderline unintelligible,"I do not recommend this book. It purports to deepen one's ""awareness"" or theoretical appreciation of tango but, instead, it mires you down in almost unintelligible concepts and distinctions. It was not enlightening at all, largely because it speaks in gibberish and sophomorish ideas. So, look elsewhere for some intellectual stimulation regarding tango."
2,An entire chapter missing?,This book is very good until just before the end. There are too many things left unanswered at the end.For example - (1)What was the exact relation between Williams and one of the cousins? (2)When was the microphone placed in the office and by whom? (3)What was the role of the personal secretary in the conspiracy?...And many more!
3,bad ending,"The idea is very good, but not so good in the end. Mr. Sheldon didn't make it quite clear. The ending just hanging over there. It's just unlike him."
4,Great book!,"This book was a great book. The ending could have had a little more pizzazz to it and could have extended Elizabeth and Rhys's relationship, but overall it was good. The twists were fun and I'm glad I got read this book :)"
4,very good book,"I love Sidney Sheldon novels, the characters are so interesting. Any of his novels are good choices or gift ideas."
5,Good book!,"I have read bloodline a few times in Spanish and now in english, I like Sidney Sheldon. It keep you looking for more, it is entertaining and the suspense is growing stronger.Poor Elisabeth, she can't trust on her own family.."
5,"Bloodline - Suspense, keeps you glued to the book!","The history behind the book , the character descriptions, the whole book was a wonderful suspense filled page-turner. One of Sidney Sheldon's best books. You fall in love with the main characters."
4,Page Turner,I couldn't put this book down and was reading it every chance I got. Great suspense and lots of plot twists.
4,Sheldon in the 1970's,This is one of Sheldon's earlier books and while it's good I prefer later novels Master of the Game & Doomsday Conspiracy. Apparently this was made into a movie which flopped starring the lovely Audrey Hepburn. I'd still like to see it.This whodunnit story revolves around Elizabeth who is in control of a hugely powerful international family owned company where someone high up is sabotaging the company & trying to kill Elizabeth (they have already killed her father) to force the company to release shares to the public. Just about everyone is a suspect & has a motive.Just for the record I was unable to correctly guess whodunnit. Will you be able to guess correctly?
2,Pick a different one,"this is my 4th Sheldon novel and probably the worst after the other side of midnight. It doesn't compare to his other works like ""rage of agels"" and ""master of the game"""
3,creative lyrics,"This is a good album, but on the whole the music doesn't really grab me and hold my interest. The highlights for me are the lyrics, which are unique and very strong. Not just any group can effectively sing about strands of DNA! The vocals are great, too, but I've enjoyed LaBrie's singing more on other albums. The weakest track is 6 (Your Eyes), a rather bland ballad, something you might expect to hear from an 80's hair metal band. Fortunately the album gets much more interesting after this. Personal favorites are tracks 7 (La Mer) and the catchy 11 (Off the Ground). I loved the use of banjo in 13 (Cultural Genetics). Henning Pauly, the force behind this album, is a skilled multi-instrumentalist and composer. The album is enjoyable but not essential. Definitely worth checking out for fans of LaBrie's work in Dream Theater."
3,Disappointed,"After reading many of the reviews on this album, it sounded like it would be good. I purchased it and listened to it, and it was not what I expected. While the music may be interesting, it should be noted that this is not the same genre as Dream Theater. I would classify this as Jazz, with a definite ""Yes"" feel to it. This was not hard and tight like Dream Theater. It was very mellow, which is fine, if that's what you were expecting. So, if you are looking for something soothing and mellow, this is very nice. If you are looking for something similar to Dream Theater, I recommend Symphony X or Kamelot."
1,No on switch,"You would think there would be a way to turn on all six stations. I just moved into a 3 year old house. One sprinkler head in my back yard was missing. After replacing it. I could not get it to come on. Two weeks later. I found out it was miss labeled as a side sprinkler. No I am not stupid. I can program a vcr and a dvd.I work in a high tech job. I work with to many computer systems to count. After reading the instructions on the pannel, going on line looking at the manuel, watching videos. I have yet to find a on switch. If you look at this, Do not be fooled by the system on label on the dial. You are directed to the six stations and you can only turn on one at a time. This system is poorly designed. If I had to choose a system with only one feature I would want a on switch. How are why would you desigen a control system with no on switch. DO NOT BUY THIS.............."
5,#1 favorite disc,"I've been listening to this for nearly 20 years... and NEVER tire of it. It is moody, fun and awe inspiring. This IS the only disc I have stockpiled, and gift to friends who love as much as I do."
4,It was a gift that was well received,"... well received by my 28 year old son, an aspiring drummer-percussionist. How could you NOT like the percussionists in the sound track? they have a wealth of experience and talent and, younger son's opinion to the contrary, are still in their prime as musicians and also were at the time of the recording.altogether a very nice piece of work."
5,"Bah Humburg, Lorna Balian","I have been searching for this book! My children and I used to check this out of the library every Christmas for over 5 years! My daughter, Nicole, would laugh about the big brother--and her big brother, Rob, would act just like him. Nicole and Rob were excited about me trying to find this book, even though they are going to be 21 and 25 respectively. These books are for everyone, children and adults alike. Buy it for all your favorite people!"
3,Nice Wall Jack,"This is a nice wall jack set up, It works great for lifting a wall, I did a 55 foot 9 foot high wall by myself with this, in windy and wet conditions, the only thing I would watch out for is that once you are going up be ready to go up, coming back down with the wall in near impossible, and could be quite dangerous."
1,Bad customer service,I orderd THE book for my Masters course that I am doing . These people have not honored their end of the bargin and refuse to respond to my email. I think I might be robbed.
5,Beautiful Precursor To Planet Drum....,"This CD goes well with the following CD Planet Drum.This is Mickey's CD companion to the superb book ""Drumming At the Edge...""I just love how the CD starts off with the quietness of the ""Forest"" noises, going from track to track adding a little more percussive instruments building up to track 5 where Mickey & Co start to really cook. It is almost like you are starting at the beginning of time up to the present.Great stuff to set your mind to!"
3,Half an Album,"The first half of this album was in a word, boring. Miscellaneous animal noises, a few beep and booms very forgettable. By about track four or five it started to get some interest, more like what I have come to enjoy about Mickey Hart. Over all I found it to be disappointing, not one of his better efforts."
4,A yardstick for other disasters,"This book was written about two years after the collapse of a containment pond that changed the landscape for a small town in rural Appalachia by a sociologist whose main job was to collect testimony of eye witnesses and survivors of the flood that scraped the valley bare for use in a law suit made on behalf of the victims against the mining company whose job it was to maintain the containment pond.the way it went about carefully reviewing the history of the area since settlement helped to understand the disaster in the context of the community, its cultural norms, its strengths and weaknesses.The story is often one of people finding it difficult to pick up the pieces. So much of their social fabric had been picked up and washed away. One question left unanswered is what has happened in the intervening decades.This man-made disaster has become a yardstick for comparison to judge other disasters."
4,An excellent description of the disaster and its' effects,One of the better books I've read detailing the issues involved in natural disasters and their aftermath. Erikson describes in detail what the survivors went through and how they dealt with the destruction of their community.
5,A very special daily feeding,This is no ordinary daily journal! This book was a gift and it was a while before I read it. I never knew what I was missing. These connections with God have touched the very points where I was needing His touch. I have shed tears all through the days as God seemed to know what I needed most. This one is a keeper! And a giver!
2,little snow socks,Still too large for our 5# yorkie. He didn't like them on his feet. The pads are rather stiff and don't really bend with the paw.
1,punctuation is a problem,This book could possibly be very good if it was not for the lack of commas and full stops it makes it near impossible to make sense of the narrative and it becomes tedious having to reread every page especially when the subject matter is so dull if you enjoyed reading this review which contained no punctuation than you may just enjoy this tedious book
3,Short annotation of Melton Wright's biography on Billy Sunday,"A non-critical biography of Sunday`s life, focusing on his evangelistic career, particularly his characteristics and character. One chapter details song leader Homer Rodeheaver. Includes a forward by Billy Graham`s song leader Cliff Barrows, and a collection of Sunday quotes."
5,powerful novel; not as dated as you might think,"This novel was written at the height of WWII and concerns the plight of millions of people seeking to escape from war-torn Europe and the Nazi threat. It humanized in it's day, the faces of good people caught up in a brutal period of history, and at the mercy of governmental quotas, that mean more than dangers and needs, and rules and regulations that mean more than threatened lives. If you are only interested in it as fiction, it gives you a real sense of what that time period must have been like. For others, it shouldn't be too hard to draw parallels to the crisis laden periods we have experienced more recently or, unfortunately will again in the future. It also offers a realistic picture of a career woman of that era, a woman who is good at her job, enjoys it, and is capable of taking control of her own life as well as trying to help others. ""The Trespassers"" is out of print now but worth the seeking out."
2,"Raunchy, whacked-out, not for the faint of heart","The novel opens with explicit sexual description that is also funny and continues in this way throughout. It's hardly a conventional mystery, though there is a murder that involves a mysterious,reclusive author. Of the plot, the less said, the better. The main characters are two female English teachers in a community college in the Washington, D.C. area; the clientele is mostly minority. These students are being offered a Milton course. The novel has something of the flavor of Fay Weldon but is a little cruder and rather more vulgar. Fun if the reader doesn't mind the raunch and isn't expecting a standard mystery."
1,Disappointing Video,"Pete Anderson is one of the best honky tonk guitarist of the last 20 years. His work with Dwight Yoakam is classic hillbilly picking. The DVD only shows a few of his ""secrets"" and fails by not showing a split screen (showing both hands at once). Interesting, but doesn't deliver on ""teaching"" at all."
1,This price is WAY to high!,"My son has this book for his 6th grade science class, and I was trying to find a study guide for it. I never found a study guide, but as I was looking for one I came across this Amazon listing for the actual text book for $129. I found a listing for the exact same book at [...]for ONLY $1! They had more than 10 copies at that price, and others for around $2.50... So my advice is, look around before you spend $129."
3,Again Not too Crazy about this film,Again I bought this DVD due to having Gerard Depardieu in it and especially his son Guillaume. Still the story line seemed crazy. It is just different I guess. But I was not crazy about this story.
4,Son seeks closure,This movie offers a hard hitting and very important lesson for men dealing with their fathers.
5,Warm words and pretty pictures,"Working more on sound identification than letter recognition, this is a good alphabet book for the slightly older crowd. With each page or spread featuring a letter sound, the book outlines the fun activities that a boy and girl have when visiting grandparents, from a bubbly bath to a perfect friend for playing pretend and ending with zithers and guitars under zillions of stars. Simple colorful illustrations are a plus with lots of geometric shapes - round smiling faces, triangular bodies, and rain falling in straight lines. A good read-aloud for preschool-1st grade."
1,Never buy it,They cancel the order after a week without any reason. It is really embarassing experience that I never have gotten.
3,My review,"I grew up with this classic story of a boy who lives in a town where everything has a point but himself. After being banished to the pointless forest, where he might fit in better, learns that he has a point after all. I also loved the story behind it about a boy who is at a generational difference of opinion with his father who believes stories are best read to children, and The boy would rather watch a program on the television. The boy relizes that they have more in common than the father might suspect. Funny and classically poinient. I am, However, disappointed in the narration of the story. I can't find the copy with Alan Thicke Narrating it. I just believe that Alan had a more fatherly voice than Ringo, and would really love to see the version with Alan Thicke as the narrator again."
1,WTF??? STOP RIDING TUPACS JOCK,This is horrible...people are squeezing anything they can outta tupac it really sucks...Tupac would be sueing every last one of clowns if he was alive...
3,Running for Our Lives,I want to thank Ms. Inness for giving us the opportunity to share our voices with others. I have been writing for a long time and have seen so many letters of rejection that I began to think my voice was unimportant. But our voices are important; every girl has a story. My contribution to this book was important but its only a fraction of what is really going on today with girls in our society. This book stands as a vital part of the whole being -- girls everywhere are running; listen when they speak. *peaCe*
3,Dated but has some Merit,"Ah back in the days were men were men and women were not. This book is a glorification of Stirling Moss, but he was one of the greatest race drivers ever. It is very dated in its style but has some good points. The author should have gotten a room with Mr Moss though. It shows a side of Formula racing that has not been seen so much."
4,a look through the eyes of a driver of the old school,"A really good read, taking the reader into the front seat of all types of cars as raced and rallied by one of the ""gentlemen of the track"". Plus a peep into the offtrack life of the stars of the past racing generation"
3,Very basic book,"Time for a new edition. I have been tracking this franchise since edition #4...Bottom line is that the ""gold standard"" has become more and more streamlined.In all fairness, the book is amazingly current, incorporating the latest research, e.g. decision making, neurocinematics, etc.Sometimes, this comes at the cost of substance.Biggest pet-peeve: The CD is somewhat useless. Where are the figures from the book?"
3,review of this purchase,"it takes 15 days to get the book surprised me a little, and the book also has a little broken part ont he hard cover."
1,LIAR!!!,"i WISH I HAD A VIDEO CAMERA SO I COULD SHOW THE WORLD WHAT A LIAR THIS PERSON IS WHO SOLD ME THIS "" LIKE NEW "" CONDITON OF THIS BOOKTHE BINDER IS TORE THE COVER IS HANGING!!!! THERE IS NO WAY i COULD RESELL THIS BOOK WHEN I AM FINISHED WITH IT....I AM UTTERLY DISGUSTED WITH THIS SELLER THEY ARE LIARS AND HAVE NO INTEGRITY"
3,Single hook,"In looking at one of the reviews for the ladder hook, it said these were sold as a pair. It is not, so you will need to order two. I really do not know why these are NOT sold as a pair, since it clearly says in the instructions to use two hooks."
1,changed listing same price,"A freind of mine bought a set same price I liked them so I ordered thinking it was two did,t know they changed it to just one. He paid about same price for two.Why can't we leave seller feed back for Amazon when they sell a item or contact Amazon????????????????????????"
3,Only one hook per order but you can use only one.,"The hook is solid enough to handle your weight with only one hook, just tried it. If you plan to use it often, get two. It works well on my fairly steep metal roof but think a shallow roof might feel less safe but if you have a shallow roof, won't need a ladder hook in the first place. Need something to protect your roof surface, especially a painted metal roof."
3,Does not work on steeply sloping metal roof!,This was a waste of money for me. I bought two and fastened them to my metal ladder only to find that it was very easily dislodged that no one would go up the ladder on my metal roof. Probably would work okay on a shigled roof.
4,Great help,"This product does the job well. Its a bit over priced because you will need two in my opinion. It was easy to install and easy to use the ladder on the roof once in place. It took my husbands weight which is 210lbs and he felt, once in place, safe and secure. Would recommend these for those steep roofs like ours."
3,Buyers still being deceived on this item,"I read the reviews of several people here complaining that two hooks should be included, and recommending folks to buy two.As I looked the page over, the photo of the item clearly states ""2 Pack"". I wondered if it could be possible that Amazon had listened to people's complaints, and was now shipping 2 hooks per order.I was doubtful, but placed one order, and got one hook. Why they have ""2 Pack"" in the photo is beyond me. (not to mention inaccurate and deceptive)The hook itself does look very good. Heavy, good quality."
1,Too little too late,"I ordered this product expecting that there was a pair of ladder hooks, since the ladder needs two for saftey. I ordered the product on 052109. I called on 060209 because the item had not arrived by the time promised. the item was not shiped until 060909, when I was away for two weeks. Three attempted deliveries failed while I was away. The item was shipped back to sender. I called the company and they sent it back at my expence. I received the shipment on 061809 with only one ladder hook. Suffice it to say I was not satisfied with this transaction. However, I must say this is only the first negative experience I have had with Amazon.com. I hope it will be the last."
2,Not the best on the market,"Bought two thinking would use on two ladders on 10:12 new roof. As with the other reviewers found that a pair is needed for each ladder.Good point: the wheel swivels.Otherwise: the radius of the hook is too tight and cannot think that this will handle ridge vents; the bearing material on the end of the hook (angle iron) is too sharp and will cut felt; the adjustment of the bearing material is impractical - thought that if I loosened the bolt (the nut is of the locking type so presumed this is the designer's intention)the angle iron would adjust to the roof, instead one end swiveled into the vertical position and gouged the roof surface (am using the ZIP system so surface damage has to be repaired).What to do? Looked beyond Amazon and bought the ACRO 11081 Roof Hook. One per ladder. None of the problems with the above. Only possible con is that the wheel does not swivel: so far not a big deal."
4,Price is for 1 not 2,"The listed price is for 1 ladder hook, not 2 as listed in one of the previous reviews. I just learned this the hard way. You cannot use only 1 of these ladder hooks to secure a ladder on a roof."
4,Eating soup is fun,I love these spoons and it makes eating soup even more delicious. I bought 50 because the price was right and I don't have to worry about replacements.
3,"Ok, the other review was right...","These spoons ARE small. I have extensive experience with Chinese soup spoons, and these are indeed miniature versions of such products. They are very nice, and if you have little kids, they'd be more useful, but they are Hobbit sized as far as Chinese soup spoons are concerned. I measured the volume; they hold exactly one tablespoon."
3,"Good book, poor editor","This book like many written by present day Indian writers goes on far too long. The writing is good and in some parts very good, the observations keen and Mona Lisa enticing (Mehta must have a very forgiving wife) but what could have been something sharp, poignant and polished collapses under verbosity. Pity."
2,Well written but woefully inaccurate,Amazed though I am about how author tried to fit all stuff about Mumbai in this book the cost is that- without even reasoning and just mentioning facts it shows a level of inability to understand the actual ground facts and false of authority which is immature though not wrong. Being a Mumbai native does not give any one right to mention or come to indigenous conclusions with stated sense of accuracy. One needs high level of maturity and thorough knowledge to mention facts briefly but with sense of comprehensive authority.Mr.Mehta is seriously lacking these abilities and writing a book does not make one a master of subject as is understandable from this experience.Mr.Mehta needs to update his woefully inadequate sociopolitical knowledge and rewrite this book for everyone's sake and for accuracy.
2,Disappointing,"So much potential. So little delivered. The first chapter of the book is brilliantly written and very readable. Unfortunately the author is not able to sustain this after that. He has to resort to cheap tricks just to keep the book alive. Even with that, the book drags on after the first chapter with the author using way too many words to convey way too little information. Besides being poorly written, the book is riddled with factual inaccuracies and downright lies. Don't read this book if you'd like to learn about Bombay or India because you'll be left with a biased and incorrect perspective.It's a real pity because the subject matter is rich with potential but the authors bigotry and lack of writing ability get in the way of what could have been a brilliant novel."
2,Average,"Bombay is my hometown and it is also one of the world's great cities inspiring writers from Salman Rushdie to Vikram Chandra and Suketu Mehta. Maximum City is an average work that deserves some attention but not much - it covers the usual suspects - gangsters, movies and the night life - but it doesn't touch on countless other subjects - which is understandable, Bombay has tens of millions of people and each of them has their own unique story. This is not a bad book, but it is not great either"
4,lucky not to live there,A detailed and intimate look at a completely dysfunctional city. At how people can exist in an uncivilized brutal environment. Where poverty and illiteracy are endemic and primitive minded warlords govern through naked violence. Read this book and you will know how lucky we in the western first world are.Hopefully it is a true picture. It is a personal report - supposedly not a fantasy but not certifiably so. A world is described that you would not want to enter. The book is terribly depressing. I did not finish it. It is not a book I enjoyed reading. It is a book that was remarkably informative. Important to read but not pleasant to read. Like bad news.
4,A Good Read,"A very good read. Please remember that if you are looking for a Bombay tour book, THIS IS NOT IT... On the other hand, if you have been to bombay, or have lived in bombay for an extended period of time, a year or more (like me), then you will really appreciate the author's depiction of the city, its culture, its people and what keeps it together. The only drawback of the book is the depth of explanation of certain incidents, I feel is in too much detail. Overall a fantastic book..!!"
3,Good but too long,"This is a good book about the city of Mumbai. The first half is excellent. Unfortunately, it drags on after that. Even though the book is 500 pages long, it doesn't cover Mumbai adequately. Suketu takes great pains to write about the travails of the inhabitants of the city (bar dancer, cross dresser, Jain, beggar, etc) that he interviews. However, some of these are personal stories that could've just as well have taken place in other cities as well. He does try to justify in the book how there is something uniquely Bombay about these stories, but it doesn't work (for me anyway). Many of these situations could be faced in other cities in the country, not to mention other cities outside it.For 500 pages, the book should've covered the city in much greater detail, but it digresses from the subject matter too often for too long."
4,Expansive snapshot of an interesting place,"Worth all the praise that has been lavished on it even if a bit overlong, Suketu Metha's Maximum City realistically presents the swirling, pollution-choke tableau that is present-day Bombay. In the long run, perhaps the book's greatest value will be its presenting at first-hand an account of the nefarious and destructive effect that the xenophobic Shiv Sena political party had on the tapestry of various ethnic, religious and linguistic groups that make Bombay such an interesting urban setting, a story that has been largely ignored outside of India itself (and indeed, in India only glancingly addressed). Full of humor and pathos, the book makes a good introduction for anyone visiting the region."
4,Intriguing,"Am still midway through the book which is very heavy reading. The mix of nostalgia, memory, fact and interpretation makes it fascinating. Am not too sure about the accuracy of some information which needs verifying. The uncensored usage of terms like 'ghati' can make one cringe....There are sections of the book that captivate and one is also conscious of the Mehta's deliberate attempt to discover a different side of Bombay. It cannot be the Bombay of his youth and he seeks out the world of gangsters, underworld, bar girls, bollywood and these become his experiences. This does not mean that Bombay has changed but the way he experiences it has! It is a long read and is quite heavy at times to pursue reading. The Bombay he describes does resonate and the description of the futility of the youth points to very real problems in megacities like Bombay."
4,A revealing look at Bombay,"I loved this book. It opened up areas of my city that I knew existed and have passed by , but never lingered for long. Suketu's vivid potrayal of the city and its characters leaps out of the page and I could almost smell the city and its streets. Only 4 stars rather than 5 since he has some problems recognizing that the ghatis are incharge and thinks that he is somehow superior, but that is a minor quibble. While not a travel book, it captures life in the city very vividly. If you have never been to Bombay, this book will take you there, or atleast lets you experience some of the underbelly of the city. For this Bombayite it bought back back memories of bhel puris at Chaar Rasta, crowded trains, pav bhajis at VT among others."
3,Way too long,"Interesting, but far too focused on the mafia (there *are* a lot of normal people living in Bombay too) and way too long. I tell my friends it's a good book, but to only read half of it. That's plenty. I made it to page 330 out of 540. I think I have a good idea of the rest of the book.Get the book, but only read half. And realize that a normal life can be led in Bombay as well."
5,Terrific read,"By depicting Mumbai so clearly through his words, the author paints a vivid picture of his subjects. However, the more journalistic style of this book allows readers to form their own opinions and indulge their emotions. Excellent, enjoyable, engrossing read."
3,okay book,"got a little boring. what would have made it more interesting was bombay-specific, or even india-specific facts and stories. felt like a lot of the material had little to do with the setting."
1,This book sucks,"The author is a charalatan, insensitive and (I am sure) ""casteist"" (worse than being a racist, in my opinion). He claims to have information about ""murderers"" that he has willfully withheld from the police and now wants to sue the Indian government for their mistreatment of children! How bogus can this guy be? If he wants to make a difference to Mumbai or to the world - he should start with himself."
5,Captivating - like a train wreck!,"This is a GOOD read. It bogs down a little in the underworld, but it really does pay off in full. Mehta is talented, he can really pull you in. But the subject matter can be so sad! What another world India can be. I couldn't put it down. Thank you, Mr. Mehta, for a glimpse into a world I'd otherwise never get to see. Great stuff!"
3,"Interesting, but too repetitivel","It takes some knowledge of India to get this book. Lots of political terms, names, customs, etc., probably not known to most people. A better read for those interested in this subject would be Shantaram-although it is much longer, it is more interesting. The out of Print Freedom at Midnight is a great read on partition of India."
5,Maximum City delivers in a Maximum Way,"Author of How to Mediate Like a Pro: 42 Rules for Mediating Disputes and How to Negotiate Like a Pro: 41 Rules for Resolving DisputesI just got back from a trip to Mumbai, specifically looking at the Art Deco architecture. Even though we saw a lot of Mumbai and learned a lot from our guide, I had a lot of questions and Maximum City answered them for me. I liked the way Mehta broke it down into various topics: the water, the sewers, the mafia, development, police corruption and honesty, Bollywood, garbage, beliefs, education, religions,and prostitutes. No one topic can be looked at in a vacuum. I am still processing my visit in my mind. Mumbai was my favorite city in India and that is partly because I have some understanding after reading Mehta's book. I hope he writes an update soon on the latest developments"
2,Basic Business Stats Case Book,The publication date on this casebook is about a decade ago and originally the data for the cases came in a format not easily used after download. They may have been updated to a more modern format but I was not successful in opening them.
3,Too fast,"My bf and I are pretty new to yoga. It sounded fun to do it together in a way that lets you get deeper into a pose, but this was like speed yoga. Even if we knew all the poses already, I think it went by too fast to be very useful. The dvd is not that long, I think they could have added another 20 minutes and made something really worthwhile.I still like the concept and we're going to try another partner yoga dvd."
4,Brother XL5700-its a good deal,"I bought the machine after picking up a more expensive new Singer which was garbage. I was told by Singer customer service that I should have probably bought a more ""advanced"" machine.They would not take it back and so I said I'll never buy another Singer. Thsi Brother machine is my first. The price was very good at a local big box store. It set up wonderfully and I was sewing in 10 minutes. The machine runs very smoothly and is much quieter than other sewing machines I have owned or used in quilting classes. I quilt around 30 hours per month with my machine, but didn't want to spend $500 or more for a basic sewing machine. I am very happy with the purchase of this XL-5700 for under $200."
2,Not user friendly...,"The instructions on this machine leave A LOT to be desired. Admittedly, I'm a new sewer, but my Mom is quite experienced. We both spent over an hour trying to get it threaded the first time! Once you figure it out (forget about the directions!) it's relatively easy. However, the machine doesn't handle heavier fabric well and the thread and stitches quickly get uneven. I just wanted a basic machine to do simple alterations on my son's clothes - now I'm more frustrated than ever."
4,Wonderful Music,"This is one of my all time favorite latin jazz albums. It features wonderful vocals from Airto and Flora and of course amazing percussion from Airto. The supporting cast is equally strong with Kei Akagi on piano and the great Joe Farrell on saxophone. Kei Akagi is an amazing piano player who went on to play with Miles Davis. I use to see him with Stanley Turrentine and later saw him do a show with a nice quartet including Rick Margitza. Kei reminds me of Bill Evans or Allan Broadbent combined with McCoy Tyner, a very sweet combination. Of historical significance on this album, it was the last recording of Joe Farrell prior to him death. Joe Shines with his obviously Coltrane influenced soloing. He was at the top of his game and is brilliant on this recording. This album is live, well recorded, and historic."
4,This dog can bite!,"This is the only album by the Wesley Willis Fiasco. Wesley Willis made dozens of solo albums, but this is the only album he made with a group. If you are familiar with Wesley's solo albums, this album is a lot different from those. While Wesley's solo albums feature pre-programmed keyboard tracks, the Fiasco songs have a hard rock feel to them. The Fiasco is actually a very good hard rock band. As for Wesley, well... he's Wesley. All his songs follow the same basic structure, but at least with the Fiasco there is some variety in the intrumental arrangements. His solo recordings tend to sound very similar instrumentally. Those of you who like Wesley will love this album. Those of you who don't like Wesley won't like this album. It's that simple. Oh, I almost forgot to mention the hidden bonus track, which is several telephone messages that Wesley left on Dale Meiners' answering machine.Rock over London.Rock on, Chicago.Amazon dot com.And you're done."
1,What is everyone thinking?,"Ok here's the deal. Everyone who has written a review here knows this is crap. Its not that I don't like it or something, just the simple fact is that it is crap. The genre that this ""music"" fits into is called CRAP. There is no other way to explain it. That said, it is mildly entertaining... To hear once... Maybe..."
2,Different from what I expected,"I had the pleasure of reading reviews of this title before buying the product. Unfortunately the reviews I read did not clarify my mind about the product and I ordered it anyway, I was under the wrong impression that this dvd will create interest in various topics of physics among my students. However, to my utter dismay, the video is for those students who want to learn the subject without a teacher and to me it looks like a dry presentation of a very interesting subject. I would be useful only for those who wish to study the subject of physics at home without the help or guidance of a teacher.-drheracoaching"
2,"Pavarotti, where are you?","I have a strong feeling that this was a fine performance of the Verdi Requiem. Just look at the stellar line-up of soloists. But unfortunately, I am unable to tell, because the sound quality is just DREADFUL. It's all cloudy and murky from beginning to end - you can just sense the wonderful voices of Pavarotti and Scotto lurking underneath the mud. Please don't get this recording if you plan on doing anything with it other than enjoying the cover art and the program notes."
3,Skip this and buy the Video,"I have not heard the sound of the performance on this label; I cannot comment on this. However, I have lived for decades with various tapes and CD issues which had excellent stereo (unusual for its day) sound.The VIDEO of the is available for a very reasonbly price throughbershirerecords.com or through Premier Opera. So why bother with this CD only pressing at all. The video is in black and white so please don't expect this to look like something from a major company like DG or EMI.However, it is extremely watchable, clear and the sound is fine in mono.By the way the performance itself is magnificent: it is so exciting to see a handsome young Abaddo leading such fabulous voices in their physical and vocal prime. This is a gem that should not be missed!"
4,vegetarian cookbook,This is a good book for Vegetarian's and people who are starting out as vegetarian's! There are good useful tips and advice along with awesome recipe's!
3,"Good dishes, vague direction","While Kirchner has presented some interesting and tasty dishes, the directions leave something to be desired. Admittedly, by being on one's toes, one can avoid some of the pitfalls found in the recipes, but if you are like I am and slavishly follow directions for an unfamiliar recipe, there are potential disasters afoot. For example, the Yam Masala, a yummy side dish, the recipe calls for blackening chiles then adding garlic. Of course, if you have enough heat to blacken chiles, you have plenty of heat to blacken and eventually ignite minced garlic. So, overall, good recipes, but be wary!"
1,a major disappointment from MHC-can't believe she wrote it!,Almost as bad as her daughter Carol Higgins Clark's books - could CHC have written this drivel
4,Not her best - but still a good read,"Pretend you don't see her has M.H.C. written all over it (not just on the cover). It is fast-paced, attention grabbing from the start, and filled with interesting and questionable characters. However, I usually have a bit more trouble figuring out the ""bad guy."" I thought this book was far more predictable than previous books, with a plot that almost slowed down too soon before ending.I personally think that M.H.C. is putting out her books too fast lately. I think she needs to take more time and think through every little mysterious detail. Then give us classics like 'Loves Music, Loves to Dance'...it would be worth the wait."
5,Another MHC great!,"This is just another in a long line of great suspense novels by MHC. I was on the edge of my seat half the time, flipping pages, getting breathless, as if I was running with her. One thing that is mindboggling to me is how freely information was given out on Lacey by well-meaning people. Makes you wonder if this type of information is given that freely in real life....just call me paranoid, but after I read her books, usually something strikes me like that which makes me wonder if it could happen for real. To me, this makes for a believable fiction author"
4,"Good, But have read better...","Entertaining story but expected more suspense and at times the plot was very predictable. For all those out there that were hanging on to find out who the bad guy was...clue in, it's never the first evil character you meet"
1,A real disappointment.,"Boring!!! I usually finish a good book in a week (I also work for a living), this one took me three! Very dull and predictable reading about a character I couldn't grow to like. Great author, what happened here?"
1,zzzzzzzzzzz,"This book did not scare me, was predicatable, and a lot of it didn't even make sense. When you go to an airline ticket booth and ask if someone is on a specific flight (or any flight) they will tell you outright that they CANNOT divulge that information. This was the turning point in the book when Sandy found out Lacey was headed to Chicago. Please! My sister loves M.H.C. This was my first M.H.C. book. I won't read anymore."
4,Better than her other recent books...,"Pretend You Don't See Her was like returning to earlier Mary Higgins Clark books. She seems to have gotten more substance in this book--similar to The Cradle Will Fall or Where Are the Children. I am an avid Mary Higgins Clark fan and usually buy her books as soon as they hit the stand. This book made me glad I did. It had suspense, romance, unique plot, and some neat twists (although some were predicatable). Thanks for getting back to a ""not-so-lightweight"" mystery"
2,Forced Plot,"Lacey Farrell, a young (30ish) woman is witness to a murder(er). She works for a real estate firm showing high priced condo's, etc. One woman calls to put her dead daughter's condo up for sale but she is having a hard time of it since she really doesn't believe her daughter's death was an accident...Come on Mary! Don't insult us readers! Might be good if you didn't ask your readers to buy into everything making it so forced... And the ending -- how Lacey figured everything out was just as forced.And the romance in the book -- Lacey finds a guy she is interested in while in the witness protection program but decides that after one date she just can't lie (or at least not be open about her past) but yet he decides to still pursue her and pursue her (after only 1 date) --reads more like stalking than romance!"
3,It was ok,"This is my first Mary Higgins- Clark book, and I did not find it that great. I liked how she developed Lacey's character, but the so called romance betwwen her and Tom was nonexistent. Also I thought that there would be a more important reason for the murders of Heather, Isabelle and Max. Personally, I found it a bit dry. Although, I was not fascinated by this book, I will try another Higgins-Clark book!!"
1,Not one her best,This the first Mary Higgens Clark book that I did not enjoy. It lost me early on. I found it hard to believe that Lacy Farrell would not give all the evidence to the Police ASAP. I did not buy the fact that she made a promise to a dying women. The whole thing was to predictable.
3,"Good, but not one of her best","I love Mary Higgins Clark and can't wait until they come out in paperback because you can never get them in the library. I was disappointed in this one though. Not enough suspense and a phone call to ""Tom"" in Minneapolis - come on!! My first thought after finishing the book was - too interested in her new marriage."
5,Outstanding!,"This was a great book, one of my favorites. I never got bored with it, I kept wanting to read more. I was surprised with the murderer, it wasn't who I wanted it to be! I definitely think you should read this book!"
5,IF SOME THINGS WOULD'VE MADE SENSE...,"THIS BOOK WAS REALLY GOOD!!! I REALLY LOVED IT BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE PROBLEM, SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAPPENED JUST DIDN'T MAKE SENSE. LIKE WHEN THE HUNTMAN APPEARED AT THE HOUSE IN LONG ISLAND WHERE LACEY WAS GOING, SHE SHOULD'VE AT LEAST SHOWN JUST HOW SLICK HE WAS. SOMETIMES HE WOULD JUST SEEM TO APPEAR IN CERTAIN PLACES WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION. IT WAS STILL A GREAT STORY AND IT DEFENITELY HAD ME IN HUGE SUSPENSE EVEN THOUGH I'M LAZY WITH READING FICTION BOOKS. THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT MOVIE (IF IT'S DONE BY THE RIGHT PEOPLE):)"
5,"Great book, as expected","I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Mary Higgins Clark has the ability to capture you into the minds of the characters in her novels. You know what the villian is thinking at all times. Her books are not easily read on audiocassette because the smallest details are not to be forgotten, I often need to flip back to earlier portions of the book to find the relationship between characters or events. This book is one of those books. In order to find out the relationship between characters introduced later in the book I needed to flip to the first couple of chapters. For those interested in a book to read on a cold winter night, pick this one!"
3,Suspenseful novel of murder and twisted surprises,"PRETEND YOU DON'T SEE HER is a fascinating story that will thrill the thrill seekers, seduce the romance seekers and guide the adventurous through a life-threatening journey, all within the comfort of their favorite reading place. You will experience this novel through the eys of a young lady named Lacey, who gets mixed up in a murder investigation. Unfortunantely, Lacey is forced to give up her identity for a new one where she ends up meeting a handsome man named Tom Lynch. Take time to cuddle up with this novel by Mary Higgins Clarkand discover what happens to Lacey when she decides to take matters into her own hands and tries to re-claim her identity."
4,Thrilling,I really enjoyed reading this book! From the moment I started reading I could hardly put the book down. English is not my native language but MHC's book are usually very easy to understand!
1,Nothing interesting,"This was my first book of Mary Higgins Clark and will be the last! I bought this book from the new release section in the bookstore and felt not very happy about it. I found that from the beginning 'til the end, there was no exciting and nothing interesting. Plot was so weak and charactor was so predictable and unreasonable. It was very easy for me to put this book down and not bother to pick it up again."
4,A good read....,"This book was hard to put down, as are most of MHC. Definitely a must read if you love a suspenseful mystery."
1,Waste of money,"Spoiler Alert:The author makes her protagonist do stupid things. Worse, however, is that it is clear in the first chapter who the big criminal is. Clark recycles her plots, her characters, and her reasoning, so it's easy to figure out the story without trouble. What a waste of money."
4,Enjoyable,"While I couldn't give this book 5 stars, it was still a good read, and shows off some of Ms. Clark's writing ability. I especially liked this book because of the surprises that kept coming, and racked my brain trying to figure out whodunnit to Heather Landi. The mark of a good book has a hard-to-figure out whodunnit, and this book is also nicely-paced. Classic MHC, a solid read."
3,Good but not great,"This was a well researched book with interesting insight into the witness protection program. Unlike a lot of detective/ thrillers, this novel was easy to follow. However, the characters did not leap off the page and many of the scenarios seemed implausible. If I'd related better to Lacey, the protagonist, I might have gotten more chills on her behalf. Having said all that, this is still a good book to take on a plane or to the doctor's waiting room."
2,Going downhill fast.,"MHC is becoming boring, repetitive, and lacks, well, just about everything in this book. I'm really disappointed. No character development as usual and I wasn't surprised or kept on the edge of my seat with the plot. I'm hoping MHC will get back to her old writing soon. This was written by an amateur definitely."
4,A definite page turner!,"While the beginning started off with a bang, the middle tended to slow down at times. It still does not change how engrossed I became with Lacey's character and those of her co-characters. Even though her romance with Tom was a bit hokey, I could not put down the book until the very end (which was very suspenseful)."
3,Her recent books follow the same formula,"I was disappointed with this book, but not terribly surprised. Over the last few years MHC's books have become very formulaic, the protagonists all seem to blend together. Lacey Farrell was simply someone I could not get interested in. I kept reading, hoping it would get better. I was interested in reading this book because I thought it would give some sort of ""insider's view"" to the workings of the Witness Protection Program. I cannot imagine that they let people in the program call home once a week - for just the same reasons as was shown in the book!!! I have a hard time feeling any empathy for characters that are as stupid as these."
2,Plays out like a juvenile R.L. Stine book,"""Pretend You Don't See Her"" was the first MHC book I've ever read. And I doubt I'll read another one of her books again. The plot was very predictable, the characters hard to like, and the prose was fit for a child. From MHC's reputation, I had been expecting an exciting page-turner, but instead I found a disappointing, under-developed antinovel."
4,Mysterious and enjoyable.(K.F-per#7),"I really enjoyed this book. The author really knows how to keep you in suspense and interested throughout the whole story. Lacey Farrell is a very interesting and inspiring character. Even though she had t pretend to be someone else she never forgot who she really was. Considering that, I believe she is a great inspiration to everybody. This story drew me in until I couln't put it down. Reading this book made me want to read more books by the same author. I love to read and this novel increased that love. Interesting yet loving, mysterious yetv involving. This book honestly made me very happy that I know who I am, and inspired me to never forget that."
4,Excellent,This was a great book. It will keep you wondering what is going to happen next. Lacey is full of strong will and will do anything to keep alive. I admire her strength to carry on. This is one of my favorites by Mary Higgins Clark.
4,"Well, it was a MHC, so it was better than most books, but...","Well, I like Mary Higgins Clark's style of writing, and I will never put down a book of hers, but I found this one to be not quite up to par with her usual quality.For one thing, it seemed quite rushed. When Lacey/Alice was thinking that Tom and she loved eachother, it was only the 2nd time or so the two had been on a one-on-one level.And the culprit (I won't tell you who he/she is!) wasn't the greatest surprise either. I am used to MHC's style of having one of the main characters who you would never expect, be the killer. In this case it was a very small character. The ending also seemed very rushed and a little too conveinently.But I do not regret reading it, there were parts in the book I loved, and of course, MHC was the author so you've gotta love it baby. --Rachel"
2,Not one of her best by far...,"Not much to add to what others have said, but I just want to make the point that no one uses the term ""sore"" any more to say they are mad, ticked off, angry, etc. She uses this term in all her books and it makes the dialogue sound as dated as an old Hollywood movie from the 50's (or before).The books have always had simplistic characters, clunky dialogue, etc., but at least they used to be exciting and well-plotted! I now reserve them from the library rather than plunk down the big bucks for a hardback."
2,She's done better,"'Pretend You Don't See Her' didn't have the wallop of some of Mary Higgins Clark's other books(particularly the older 'Stillwatch' or the more recent 'Daddy's Little Girl' or 'Night Time Is My Time'). This one seems to have just sort of fallen together, as we're quickly told a few things about Lacey, and almost too much about the supporting characters. The journal that's supposed to tie everything together only muddles things even more. The stereotypical 'Italian mobster' bad guys, and the sometimes stilted and outdated dialogue, seem out of place for a mid-90s book. The tension is drawn-out and forced, and can't over come the predictability of what's going to happen(or actually, what's not going to happen; the major flaw of the book is that it makes a point of suspense out of something the reader knows isn't going to happen, anyway).Sure, it has a happy ending...it's the beginning and middle that need help."
4,Ususal formula,"Pretend You Don't See Her is a typical Mary Higgins Clark novel - lots of characters, lots of plot, lots of plot twists but not too much substance. I enjoy a plot-driven book, but need the characterizations to make it a fulfilling experience, and I suspect that MHC sacrifices characterization for plot. At least, the lead player should be deeper and we should get to know her better. With Agatha Christie, we always empathised with at least one person (usually the detective who was seeking to resolve the mystery), but with Mary Higgins Clark, that closeness is sorely missing and, unfortunately it detracts from the pleasure of her novels. That said, Pretend You Don't See Her gives what it says it will give - a fast-paced thriller that will have the reader guessing right up to the final chapter. For plot, I give this book five stars. For depth of character two. Average? Three and a half, so let's say four."
2,Not impressed,"This was my first time reading a book by Mary Higgins CLark and I have to say I was not impressed at all. I though that this book was predictable and unorigional. It carried on and did not have very good caracter development. I think I will keep shopping around for an author that has fresh, exciting ideas."
2,My Least Favorite Mary Higgins Clark Book.,"Usually I enjoy Mary Higgins Clark's stories. They are not great literature but at least they keep you in suspense. This one was so lacking in intelligence and so full of ""amazing coincidences"" that I could hardly finish it. The main character is presented as sophisticated, yet she is about the stupidest woman I can imagine. Everything she does is so foolish! I almost think someone else besides MHC wrote this book!"
3,Pretend This Isn't Predictable,"""Pretend You Don't See Her"" is the first book of Mary Higgins Clark's that I have read, and it confirmed my suspicions about the quality of her work. Ms. Clark is no more than a glorified R.L. Stine, from her italicized character thoughts to her bland characterization. All of the prospective ""foes"" were poorly developed; none invoked true fear or mystique. The fact that the actual killer, Sandy Savarano, was known to the heroine (and there's ALWAYS a heroINE in MHC's books) drew from the suspense. The investigation of Heather Landi's journal allowed us few excerpts, and the lack of written groundwork for the extensive connections between the ""bad guys"" left an ending that signaled the author's boredom with her topic and inability to end with a bang. Stick to reading Agatha Christie or John Grisham. This one is a lightweight."
1,Couldn't have taken long to write.,"I don't read much fiction but thought I would give this book a try based upon the author's reputation. This book cound not have taken more than a few evenings to write . Plot is simple, predictable, and very little happens throughout the book. Mercifully, the book concludes very quickly in about a page and a half. I'll stick to non-fiction."
2,Far from her best effort,"I read this book just last week and I can't remember the name of the culprit that hired Sandy! I thought the ""romance"" was flaky and nauseous. AND!! why would anyone who feared for her life choose to go back to her home city!? Give me a break! A dissappointing book from a usually thrilling author. I hope the next one is better."
3,I'm confused...,"Overall, a readable book, short and to the point, it doesn't drag in any particular one spot. But I'm confused about something.SPOILER ALERT. What was it that Isabella Waring supposedly saw in Heather's journal that was so obvious that it caused her to take such extraordinary measures to see that the journal got to her ex? Lacey Farrell only connects the dots in the journal herself after noting a change in tone in the writing in the journal after the journal mentions a lunch date with Max Hoffman, but only learns that Heather had fallen for the mobbed-up Steve Abbott after talking to Max's widow. There's no way Ms Waring could have known that information from just the journal itself or known the importance of talking to Max Hoffman."
2,overkill,"more than 15 years ago I was able to buy a wireless remote for my EOS Elan that was about the size of a box of matches and didn't need anything attached directly to the camera. When I bought this remote 6 months ago it was because it was the only available choice. Due to the weight it adds to the body it caused my tripod to fall yesterday which made the piece that fits in the hot shoe snap off, now it is worthless. Thankfully there are better (non-Canon) options to be found today so I'll spare Canon my angry note about the price of progress and how ridiculous it is to pay hundreds of dollars for something bigger than an ancient TV remote control. Adorama has a nice alternative with great reviews, save your money and buy one of those instead!Adorama Wireless Radio Remote Release for Canon EOS 5D, 10D, 20D, 30D"
5,Control your DSLR with iPhone or iPad,"With the iPhone and iPad on the market, and even Droid smart phone, you can simply buy the app for your phone or pad. Get the eye-fi SD card for your camera and basically that is it. You can remote control your camera from your phone or iPad. This is great for in-field photography. Just check out YouTube for tutorial videos of what you need and how to set it up. No more Expensive RC equipment. You already carry the remote without even knowing it, your smart phone (iPhone or Droid)"
2,adorama products,"I just received my wirelescontroler that I purchased on 2/8/10.the product came to me from adorama per amazon.comrecomendation. the item came with an international warranty and not a canon usa warranty. this is in efect a gray market item and one I never would have purchased from amazon had I known. The price charged is the same as the usa warranty,but means I must search for repairs if needed. I will never buy from amazon again when they are not the shipper.I also received the canon speedlite 430EX II shipped from 17th st. camera and it too has international warranty.Had I not needed them the day i received them I would hav returned them that day."
2,The $19.00 JYC YongNuo Works Better,"In my opinion The JYC Wire and wireless 16 Channel Dual function remote works better. It works on Fm waves so you do not even have to see the camera to focus and shoot. Over 300 feet up a trail I went, heavy forest , and bush, I could not see or here the camera ,but all 20 pics. turn out perfectly on the 7D. You can use the wire function to focus and shoot also. For $19.00 you can not go wrong. You can find one at DealExtreme, free shipping any where in the world. YongNuo RF Wireless Remote Focus + Shutter Release Trigger for Canon DSLR Digital Cameras.[...]"
3,"Shirley, Shirley, Shirley!",Cd was ok. The backup wasn't all that great but it's good. I give it three stars based on the singer.
4,Great Ladder,"I received the Krause 121543 14' Ladder as a gift over a year ago. It is a great ladder, it quickly changes from a step ladder to an extension ladder. Anyone that needs both a step ladder and an extension ladder will benefit from this product and save valuable garage space by only owning 1 ladder."
2,Some good mixed with the bad,"Over the half of the songs on this CD are sung by a children's choir that is pretty awful, because they don't sing with any emotion. I suspect the boy who sings many of the leads doesn't speak English, as he seems to be singing phonetically. However, there are several songs done by an adult group that sounds similar to the Ray Conniff Singers or the New Christie Minstrals. Those songs are better. There is a version of The Twelve Days of Christmas which is sung by a man who may be Perry Como, or a sound-alike. There are no liner notes to indicate who the performers are.I keep this CD in my Christmas collection because I like two songs on it. Sleep Well Little Children and When Santa Claus Gets Your Letter. Both of these are done by the adult group."
1,This book is boring beyond all hell,The author attempts to write in language that confuses the reader to hide the fact that the point she it trying to make is obvious and not worthy of sooooo many pages.
4,Great Costume!,"The costume was great, and was awesome looking on! It fit well, and was made well unlike alot of other halloween costumes. This one KNOCKED the socks off of my husband. This is a very sexy costume, but comfortable as well. The only downside was that the gloves were not really much like boxing gloves...more like snow gloves, but the good thing is that its hard to wear them all night anyways."
1,didn't like it,should have sent it back... I thought it was shorts not a shirt and the skirt?? well lets just say someone size 1x or 2x... it was way to short... but on the bright side the gloves were cute and the robe is plenty big enough.
4,Pretty awesome for what you pay for,"I was kinda expecting a little more, but it worked very well for a costume party, and I still wear as sexy lingerie"
5,Gets the job done.,Not a whole lot of technology involved here. The paper does what it's suppose to and makes freezing a ton of patties easy. A good press will also go a long way in making life easier. When it's time to thaw them out and fire up the grill there's no more stabbing them with a knife to get the patties apart. A box should last you for quite some time.
3,Hamburger parchment paper,"This parchment paper has worked great, but they are larger than I like, making it difficult to put the burgers into a ziploc bag to freeze for later use. Next time, I will look for smaller parchment papers closer to the size of the burgers I make, which I make with a burger press (so you can't really adjust the size)."
1,Low quality control ...,"Arrived damaged. Packaging was fine, so it was not the shipping. Paper pieces were torn, dirty with dust and greasy fingerprints and some pieces were folded over or wrinkled. I was VERY disappointed when I opened the package. 2/3 of contents were unusable and the rest was questionable. It's a food grade product after all, so I had to return it. I will not be choosing products sold by that company in the future."
1,Horrible! Not sanitary!,"The paper itself seemed OK, though I did not even try it because it was not sealed in any way. It was simply shipped inside of a box that was partially open (see my uploaded product images) and some of the parchment papers were sticking out. This is completely unsanitary! Perhaps it was only from Corydor and not from all of them."
3,A great idea but falls short,"The patties are not large enough in diameter. You can adjust the thickness, but that is not much help.Quality of construction is great, but could be easier to take apart to clean. We do use the parchment paper and this helps greatly in keeping it clean."
3,Disappointed but my fault,I was thinking for some reason that this came with the hamburger press but it does not. Other reviews made it a little misleading.
1,RIP OFF,"I would have given this book zero stars but 1 was the lowest allowed. This is a total cheap rip off chop job reprint. I could take the corn ball dread lock guys pasted on the cover with green crowns on their heads but they don't tell you that they have completely left out Budge's introducti0n. I had to go find it on line and download it (the whole book is online by the way, if you care to read/ print it).The typface is in at least two different fonts.How they got an actual photograph of Makeda, the legendary Queen of Sheba is beyond me.When you look through the index, they have left in all the references to the missing introduction so there are all these entries in roman numerals that do not exist.Give me a break."
5,A real gem,"Like most folks, I suppose, I came to Arthur Alexander via the Beatles. ""Anna"" was on their first British LP. The BBC sessions include ""Soldier of Love"" and ""Shot of Rhythm and Blues."" I bought this CD to listen to those songs, basically. But I was delighted to find there are so many other strong tracks, as well. I can see why the Beatles, and other British groups of that era, admired Alexander's work. It has a haunting quality. I don't know if you'd call Alexander a great singer in the classic sense, but he had a way of expressing feeling that you don't get from more polished singers. I listen to this over and over."
4,The perfect Arthur Alexander CD-Almost,"This is great stuff from the hit area of Muscle Shoals, Alabama. He is truly a special, mostly unrecognized artist. You will not be disappointed with this CD. I just wish it had ""Some Day I have To Cry Some"" included. That would give it the full 5 stars. But, get it anyway, you will love it. And, if you are really a fan, check out the book, ""Shot of Rhythm and Blues"" and read about his crazy life. He barely made a dime and yet he wrote the songs that were covered by the Beatles, Stones, and Bob Dylan. What a talent. He died over 10 years ago.Ray Lindstrom, Laughlin, NV"
3,Stately sung soul,"Arthur Alexander sang like his name. Dignified wide-eyed He knew Anna was cheating and was going to be the bigger man. ""You Better Move On"", sure, he told her! Perhaps that why the Brit Invasion bands i.e. Beatles, Rolling Stones, etc.. gravitated to this somewhat obscure soul singer. Stately, strong, and pissed off without being pussy about it.A TV show, ""Married..With Children"", had a memorable episode concerning the main charactor, Al Bundy, trying to figure out a song on the radio was with the first few notes of ""Anna"". He ended up paying $60.00 at an Oldies store. (Some of us got the song before the end of the show..)You can get these terrific memories cheaper and in great sonic condition with this CD."
1,"Good music, but beware of offensive packaging!","The music on this CD is lovely - it's well played and the recording is of very good quality. I have no problem endorsing the CD itself, however, don't order this for a gift or if you have children in the house unless you're planning on taking the cover apart and replacing all the inserts. Even though the CD's title, ""Classical Erotica II"", might give one pause, I certainly didn't expect to find a 5-panel unfolding insert with soft-porn lesbian-oriented photography. The packaging is extremely offensive and totally unnecessary in getting across the point that the music would be good for romance. The manufacturer/distributor should save this type of photography for books and leave it out of CD covers. It may be catering to a lesbian market, but my lesbian friends are also put off by this packaging - it is totally inappropriate."
4,Different is great,"Kate Ryan's Different is a great album. It's a great mix of trance, dance & pop.Great mix of French & English lyrics (even though I don't know French).My favourite tracks are:Desenchantee, Scream For More/Mon Coeur Resiste Encore, Libertine, UR (My Love), So In Love, Head Down/Ne Baisse Pas La Tete, In Your Eyes/Nos Regards Qui m'Enflamment."
4,Great Book; just a few details missing,"I found this book very helpful, but still had some unanswered questions such as face frame width in certain areas. It could use more detailed graphics in some areas also.Overall though, the ratings are well deserved, I don't feel the need to buy another book on this subject."
4,"Great book, if you have the tools",This book is for persons that will build more than a kitchen alone. You will need quite some precision tools to match the craftmanship illustrated in this book and obviously you have to be handy using these tools. For the rest the book is very detailed and gives plenty of ideas and tips and tricks.
5,Great Book,"Great book, If you wanna learn how to do a kitchen right buy it.....Great information on the use of story poles to."
3,Highly rated but disappointing,The hand written drawings are poorly done and lack significant detail. The photo illustrations are of good quality but are again limited in their application to the building process. Overall descriptions of the building process are scanty at best. Woodworkers interested in learning kitchen cabinet construction would be better served by reading Jere Cary's book; Building Your Own Kitchen Cabinets by the Taunton Press.
4,Don't want to find out *how* good,"So far, seems great, online product manual led me to believe this was a five pack, but that is not the case. You only get one for this price. Overall, seems quite sturdy, but I really don't want to find out exactly how good it is...."
5,This album was the start of something special,"Babatunde Olatunji's album ""Drums of Passion:The beat"" is African songs, mixed with Western Music. You will find to some of the greatests drummers from africa on this CD, and also find to the world famous Carlos Santana playing with them. Olatunji made a great impact on Afro-pop. He was one of the first people to Mix the music of Africa and America. If you are interested in African Music, this is a must by."
5,I'm Dumbfounded,"Why isn't this band here today? I'm trying not to be nostalgic, but the pure pop melodies, the seering guitars and mature, thoughtful lyrics add up to so much more, and deserve to be so much more than a forgotten album from 1980. There is so much good music on this album besides Turning Japanese that it is difficult to understand how this band, and David Fenton particularly, could have just faded away. This is a great album; a seminal new wave record."
3,"""Turning Japanese"" brings to mind other gems from 1980","""Turning Japanese,"" the Vapors' only true hit, always brings to mind ""My Mistake"" by the King Bees, ""Switchin' to Glide"" by the Kings, and ""Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime"" by the Korgis, three more lost gems from 1980."
3,Cool!,"This CD is pretty cool! It is nothing like the Casiopea stuff, or anything like his videos. This CD has akira playing a more laid back style. If you want to here ferocious solos(as if he has anything to prove), don't get this. If you want to here a nice pocket that feels good, I totally reccomend this."
5,Who dosen't like this stuff?,"Akira is THE MAN! This CD is great, it's filled with increable drums, and an equally neat jazz sound. My parents originally bought it, but know they have to put me in a straight jacket to listen to it. The song's improvisional sessions are incredable, filled with lots of wonderful rythem, and lots of solos. Although Akira dosen't solo on this one as much as he has on others, this is definitly one of the best CDs around."
4,One of the best i've heard!!,"I love powerfull Fusion with a great drum sound, and all knows Akira will never let one down. The music is well done. Its a little different from the Casiopea stuff. But this CD will move you man. Akira lays the solid drum foundation with no effort. It ROCKS!! Give it a listen, and let it move you!"
3,Cd order,"order this Cd thinking it had a track on it i required, as i had seen the track displaying this album cover.but not so, but kept it anyway.Not a bad relaxing album."
1,Don't waste your money,"These towels are the worst. the quality is so poor, I purchased them as a gift for Chirstmas for my brother, when I received it, I could literally see through them. There was no way I could give them as a gift and I myself have no use for them since they are so thin.......this purchase was a total waste. Product quality -100.don't waste your money."
4,Weep Not for Me,This little book is thought provoking. It is small in size but big on compaasion. A lovely book to keep on hand.
2,Weep Not For Me,"I believe the customer should be told that this is basically a child's book.....not a reading book. I feel as if I got ripped off. I was expecting a story, etc."
4,mhm,"A great stick if you're trying to get back into using an arcade setup or to start from scratch. It's lasted a good while but the buttons have slowly become less and less responsive. I know, I know...This should be expected but you really have to smash the buttons after about 2 years of moderate playing."
3,Great - but must be stored properly!!!!!!,"I love effer - C - but I learned the hard way that if you live in a humid environment (as I do) you must store these in an airtight storage container. Even though the packets are individually sealed - moisture gets inside and causes a reaction solidifying the contents and creating a chemical reaction which expands the packets. I had to throw away 70% of what I had purchased. I love the ease of use of the product, and the taste is pleasant. Either use them fast or store them properly."
5,awsome pictures,"A very good history of a very good car. I had to have the book right away because my car is pictured in it, but that aside, I was still very pleased with the info and the tons of good pictures..."
3,Great item but one flaw.,Simple item does what it says BUT there is no midi offset. All my devices have a midi offset to compensate for the starting point.For example most products you can have it start at 0 or 1 depending on you pedal board. When I hook this up eveything is off by one number.Other than that great product.
3,Ok but a bit disappointing,"I was very excited to see a book for Plus Size knitwear. I got my copy and the illustrations look clear, lots of variety in the pattern. So what don't I like? There are 50 patterns - only 10 go up to size 3x. I will say that 40 patterns (including some one size ones) do go up to size 2x. However why include patterns that stop at Large or Extra Large? Swirl of Gold (p. 34) is very attractive but only goes up to size Large - I don't think it should have been included. I'm glad to have the 10 patterns that will fit me - I just wish there had been more."
1,No Crochet Patterns,"Although the dust jacket says 50 Styles to Knit and Crochet there is only ONE ugly crochet shawl pattern included in the book. Also, I agree with the previous reviewer, a PLUS SIZE book should only include patterns for 1X and above. Deceptive titling, skip this book at this price."
2,Not good for anyone over XL,"I got pretty excited about the title--however, when I got this book I noticed that a majority of them were for sizes starting with small (modeled on thin girls)and there were a larger amount that topped out at XL. The prettiest sweaters are not for anyone over a large. If it was plus sized, why were small patterns even considered? Save your money if you are looking for plus sized patterns."
3,Should be called 49 knit and 1 token crochet styles,Definitely not one for those who crochet. The only crochet pattern I found was for a skimpy shawl. Most of the knit patterns are very nice (the one on the front is one of the ugly ones in my opinion). This is one of the books you'd want to thumb through before buying.
1,You've gotta be kiddin me?????,I just looked at this book in a local book store.I was interested in buying it due to the cover title that states it had crochet patterns in it too.Usually that means that at least 25% of the patterns are crochet.There is only ONE crochet pattern and it's something no one I know would be caught dead or alive in.PLEASE IF YOU ARE A CROCHETER-DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!I'm SUPER Glad that I got a look at it and Desided NOT to buy it.You would do better on the free pattern sites for plus size crochet.Or just email me-I've got tons of books and patterns for plus sizes and would pass them on.Anne
3,misleading title,"It's a good book with some really great knit patterns, but be warned... the title is quite misleading.I assumed 50 knit and crochet styles meant there would be around 30 knit and 20 crochet. No. There is 1 crochet pattern. That's right. One. And it's a shawl. So not a very useful book for someone who only crochets.And yet, there are a few really nice patterns, so I've taught myself to knit. The obligatory scarf is only 15cm long so I'm still a fair way off trying any of the patterns, but I'll get there.Oh, another not so great thing about it. It tells you the brand of yarn that is used, but doesn't use the yarn weight guide system so you are left trying to figure out the yarn weight from the needle size and the picture, and googling the brand in hopes that you can still find a description of it somewhere that tells you the weight. It does tell you the yardage per ball so when substituting you can easily ensure you buy enough."
1,Cable Vision Sweater Pattern,I started the sweater and went to the chart for the cables. The text and chart are NOT for the pictured sweater. Does anyone have an errata for this book. Family Circle (books?) has been taken over by Leisure Arts and infor on corrections is not available. Can anyone help?
3,Looking for Errata,"I purchased this book in an attempt to find some patterns that a friend would like. She settled on Diamond Duo which looked easy enough from the photo. It looks like I have run into some typos that are fairly crucial to measurements and can't find any source of correction. This is not fatal, but it is annoying. Two thing I agree with other reviewers on: 1) crochet is a joke and 2) the models are, for the most part, not what I would guess to be truly plus sizes."
1,Awful!!!,"I bought this book recently and was extremely disappointed with the awful frumpy patterns made worse by being knitted up in larger sizes, then modelled by skinny models. Of all 50 knitting projects in it, I wouldn't consider knitting one of them!"
5,A Fantastic Read-Aloud,"The Baby Beebee Bird is one of my very favorite books to read aloud to young children. The characters are varied and the baby beebee bird itself has a nice little compulsive personality. The book gives an example of problem solving and, best of all, lends itself to many open-ended questions and what if scenarios for use in the home or in a classroom situation. Most importantly, children love the book, and such love for one book can lead to love of books in general. As a teacher of young children, I believe fostering that love for books is essential to raising a life-long learner. Your children will love this book - have no doubt."
5,My love for Steven Kellog introduced me to a great book!,"I origionally bought this book thinking it was by Steven Kellog.I was a bit diappointed when I found out he just did the illustrations, until I read it to my kids.It truely is worthy of Steven Kellogs great work!!As someone who reads books to my kids full of animations and fun voices this was FUN to read!!!!SO much fun, I read it to my son's preschool for story time!It was a huge hit with all the kids and the teacher as well!"
1,Updated version not up to par!,"I remember this book very fondly from when I was a little girl and wanted to give it as a gift to my dearest friend for her children. I was happy to see it was still in print and ordered 2 copies, one for me as well. Well, I am sad to say I returned it promptly because the book has lost its charm due to the, dare I say, bad illustrations! The bird is not cute at all, but rather frightening, as are the other animals, and the text is not laid out well on the pages, making it difficult to read through. I am happy to say though, that I found a very good used copy for sale, and the children are enjoying the original version with the original illustrations and loving every page! Newer doesn't mean better!"
5,So much fun!!!,This book is so much fun to read with children. Have them act out the different animals and be as loud as possible. Kids love being the animals and working together to keep the other animals awake! Preschoolers love it and early elementary age children will too! (I love reading it to them!)
3,Interesting book but a little pricy,"As with the first book in the series you will get($11.87 seems just a little pricy to me)a nice forward and an informative first chapter followed by a number of pages about seasons 3&4. Each of the episode pages (some run 2 pages)will have a guest cast list, an episode photo, character quotes and a paragraph about the episode. Usually the best part of each page will be several following paragraphs about that particular episode with anectdotes given by various cast & crew.The final chapters of the book contain actor profiles (each actor spoke with the author), character quotes and pictures. There are also sections on costume/set design, location work and a fan bit at the end. It's a lot of fun but not really informative if you want detailed information."
5,Absolutely One of the Most Moving CDs I Have Heard,"I came across this cd while listening to Launchcast Radio. I kept writing the names of these beautiful songs that would come over the New Age genre. They were all from this cd and so, I knew then that I wanted to buy it. I have done nothing but listen to it all afternoon. It is one of the most beautiful collections that I have ever heard. The artist's name on all of these songs is Lee Johnson, yet I have never heard of him before. Sounds like some great music for a movie soundtrack. I am buying more of these to share with my family and friends. ""Lee Johnson, you are one of the best kept secrets around!"""
4,"A Fine,Fine School.","If you want a good book to read I've got one for you. It's A Fine,Fine School.It's about a girl who has to go to school for the whole year! Even her dog has to go to school. She didn't even get to play with her little brother.They even had to brush their teeth at school. They didn't even get a summer vacation.I liked this book because even the dog had to go to school. It's by Sharon Creech.I made a 100 on this book.I hope you zoom right through this book and make a 100 too."
2,Where are they?,"It is constructive to have an open analysis of any controversial topic.If there was no planned extinction of the Armenians by the Ottoman Turks, where are my father's sister, brother and mother. My father saw them butchered when he was 11 years old. His sister was younger than he. He feigned death and managed to escape alive and eventually come to America. I heard about his experiences first-hand. Is it possible that these children and mother were threats to the Ottomans? I think that the claim of the Armenians as a race being a threat to the Turks was a bit far-fetched. How can that justify murdering mothers and their children?"
2,Piece of junk,Should have read the reviews. Bought this for my son for christmas and it fell apart two days later. Can't get the company to respond to my emails or phone calls.
1,Cheap,This product is not worth the money. It is cheap and I'm not sure how to play foosball when the thing is on the floor. I am very disappointed.
2,6 in 1 Table,I ordered this for my kids for Christmas and when it arrived it was mis-packed with the wrong side boards and could not be assembled. In addition it smelled like diesel fuel after opening the package. We initially thought that someone accidentally spilled the fuel on the game but I now see that another customer experienced the same smell. There is also quite a bit of assembly required so be prepared.
2,Very Dissappointed,"The Franklin Sports game was intended as a Christmas gift for my son. He had picked it out and was very excited about it. I had intended it as a surprise, but when it arrived (at my office) the packing had ripped and it was clear what was in the box. Unfortunately, my son saw the box before I had a chance to move it! When we tried to assemble the item we could not put it together. Several of the screws were stripped. It was very heavy, which made the attempted assembly even more difficult. The final frustration was the difficulty in packing it up and returning it because of the size and weight! I would not recommend this product."
1,Not worth it!,"We bought this for our 8 and 4 year old boys. The product was damaged when it arrived (storage drawer broken). My husband attempted to assemble it anyway. The bottom panel for the foosball table was warped making that game unplayable because the handles couldn't spin freely. The ping pong panel was 'dead' so the imitation ball did not have much bounce. The pins to hold the net could not be inserted far enough into the table to stay perpendicular to the table so the net kept sliding off the pins. The air hockey puck kept getting stuck in the goal slot instead of going through it for a goal. The only surface that did not have issues was the chess/backgammon panel. Needless to say, it was promptly returned. We would not recommend this for any amount of money."
2,Worst Christmas Present,"I agree with other reviewers that this toy is very low quality and overpriced. The storage drawer had fallen apart. The wood veneer was peeling off. The air hockey may be the only portion actually used, but it is nearly impossible for the puck to fit through the slot on one side. The foosball game requires more tedious assembly than indicated. This has to be one of the worst gifts that I have given and will probably be in a landfill before the end of the year."
4,Not bad for the Price,"After reading all of the bad reviews, for the low $54 price I took a chance and ordered it. My 7 yr old son loves it. It was a bit of a pain to put together but a lot of fun to play with. There is a lot of air produced with the air hockey table but the puck does tend to get stuck if the bracket that keeps score is pushed down to far. I will agree with the other reviewers that the draw will probably fall apart very soon but again it is very compact, so to expect a larger draw would be too much. What I like about this the most is the size. It is definitely not meant for an adult. But for a 7 and 9 yr old it is perfect. I can place this ontop of my sons desk and easily put it under the bed when not in use. If you want to get the kids away from the tv, computer or video games and have a family night of games, this will be perfect. Cheap price, easy to store."
2,Not very good,This was a disappointment - the ping pong portion of the table is made of material that does not allow the ball to bounce. The only piece that is still working is the foozeball part.Very disappointing.
5,"Sadly underrated, happily enjoyed","I have been a Bowie fan for years, and have had a particularly keening interest in his 1970's recordings since I first heard the man. As a result of Bowie's ever-changing style and interests, this album is a very interesting one-off in his career. The material is to me, completely uplifting; it has great grooves, soulful and heart rending singing, and enough great funky and expansive sounding instrumentation to give the whole affair some spring in the step. This is a very sexy album (if an album can be sexy), and can really put you in a great mood. I can't help but grin stupidly when I hear David's inflections, particularly in the songs that many other reviewers seem to scorn; ""win"", ""right"", ""fascination"", and ""somebody up there likes me"". Amongst Bowie's other mid-seventies releases (Live, Station to Station, Low, Heroes, etc.)this album can seem a bit out of place. But taken on its own this is a very strong and satisfying album."
3,Multi-colored-eyed soul,"A slick soul album from the master of irony.If for nothing else, get this album for the classics, Young Americans and Fame! You won't regret it!"
1,This is not what I wanted,"I ordered this Deluxe edition from Amazon but instead they sent me the normal edition, which I already have. Thanks very much for riping me off Amazon.Although this is probably an amazing Deluxe Edition (I still havent had the chance to hear it)if you want to purchase it don't use Amazon. They will send you the normal version."
2,Bad Bowie.,"I'm a moderate Bowie fan, having about half of his discography. This is not up to par. Besides the fighty rendition of ""across the Universe"" (nobody signs ""nothing's gonna change my world"" like the King :)) and the OK ""Fame"", the rest is commercial, and badly so. I don't know what happened to him. I'm glad Amazon's Dan Epstein put it so well: ""transitional step (...), not a great record"". One feels so much better when ""somebody up there agres with you :)"".There are many other better Bowie albums. This is for fans only. Maybe if you like ""Soul funk"" also."
2,Horribly average,Although its better than most of the stuff today its Bowie's worst effort out of his best period. I own everything from Space Oddity to Scary Monsters except Young Americans. I can't stomach it. It's actually pretty funny that on the timeline of releases its right next to his best: Station to Station
1,Worst Bowie album ever,How does one go from Ziggy to this crap. If I wanted to listen to soul music I would have pulled out my mowtown collection. I actually had the displeasure of seeing this tour live. Cant tell you how disappointed I was as I had no idea he was going to do this garbage. This album never should have been made. Wish I could rate it less than 1 star. I'm afraid it was all down hill for Bowie after he lost the brilliant Mick Ronson.
2,A bit dull.,"I never cared much for this album and I doubt I ever will. Fame and Young americans are standout tracks but the rest of the songs just sound too much alike. When listened to them seperately they're enjoyable enough, but played one after the other they become a bit of a drag. Bowie's voacal delivery on this album is admirable though, it's just a shame most of his songwriting is not."
3,Bowie Heads To Disco Blues Hell - Bummer,"One of my least-favorite Bowie albums. Young Americans starts off okay with the title track and then heads into strange waters from there. His version of Across The Universe (with John Lennon) and Fame are okay. Spectacular? F*ck no! For those who think this is prime Bowie, they're either lightly into Bowie or have no idea how Bowie should be. For those who need a refresher course, The Man Who Sold The World, Ziggy Stardust & Hunky Dory ought to bring you around to realizing what tripe Young Americans is. Bummer.Dig it!"
5,Spell-tastic!,"Spell tastic is the only way to describe this book. I have been reading it and working it since I was a teenager. I am now 31 and I go back to this battered and worn hardback of my mothers time after time. After thirty years it is falling apart, and am about to buy copies for all my friends. Did I mention that Mother and I argue over this book every few months. This book contains a vast collection of spells from multible pantheons, ancient texts, and magical systems. It also contains Historical referance passages that are outstanding. All the old pictures that you see in other books....they were in this book first. This is a must have for the Witchcraft as a lifestyle Witch.As with everything, caution is advised for the inexperienced.Blessed Be )0(Tanya Punke"
1,A collection of scare-stuff,"Don't confuse this collection of myths and scare-monger stories about occultism with what actually happens in modern witchcraft. This book has lots of scary stuff, but shouldn't be confused with reality. Plenty of yucky stuff from the Inquisition witch-hunters and overactive imaginations through the ages"
3,"not a bad album, but . . .","DISCLAIMER:Pep Love is one of my favorite rhymers, period, he's a warrior poet and i have mad respect for him.i give this album 3 stars because he released something else underground that was 4, maybe even 5 stars.ascension is not a bad album.but the best pep love is unfortunately not available in stores.i got it from the man in person.ascension, side c.i'd go directly to hiero in oakland to pick this album up.made order it from the hiero website?i don't know.but that album, unfortunately not reviewable on amazon because according to amazon it doesn't exist, has some of my favorite hiphop cuts period, including the gaspers, warrior poets, and relief. PL explores his inner darkness.really really brilliant.if you liked this album, the main ascension, check it out its underground-released b-sides.oh and if you haven't picked this one up yetdon't get me wrongascension itself is a good solid album.worth getting.peaceclear"
3,"greatly anticipated, but rarely delivers","when many of us hip-hop fans think of hieroglyphics, we think of raw energy, furious beats and extraordinary samples. no one can forget the first time they heard classics like 93 til infinity, you're in shambles, or anything can happen. but unfortunately, it looks like del is the only one on point in the last few years, and both sides of the brain wasn't even all that tight. the problem is that a-plus and domino are just getting a little too digital, which, as we all know, is pretty much death for an underground head. it ruined rza, and itlooks like the same thing might happen to the hiero crew. pep love just doesn't come raw enough, and the ""chillin"" beats are basically mid nineties west coast beats, no innovation here. and the sample of the dead prez song for karma was wack. same your money for the deltron cd, if you don't already have it, or check out 3rd eye vision, although that still is a bit weak."
2,digitally generated beats,"why are alot of the underground pioneers using digitally generated beats, come on yall leave them digitally generated beats for wack mc's like dmx and jay-z and ja rule."
2,Do not buy without listening first!!! WARNING!!,"I love the heiroglyphics crew, so I went ahead and bought this without hearing it first. Big mistake. Pep has not gotten any better, as some have claimed, and he still has no real distinction to his flow. His sound is too plain. Plus, what's up with the weak music on about every track? Is this r&b or hip hop? I was expecting some in your face, get you hyped, all out party stuff, like I would get with Del or Casual. I should have known not to buy this mess when I saw the fruity cover. Dude's wearing a shammaka and a pair of ray-bans, standing on an ocean shore. UGHHHHH! Why won't cd stores refund once the plastic seal is broken? Why? WHY??? auhghhhwhhhughgguwwww. .. (silent weeping)"
5,This is what Hip Hop/Rap is all about!,"I really don't know what the people who rated this bad are talking about. This is the best album I currently own and probably ever will. Its uplifting, it has phat beats, great flo and rhyme and songs that actually mean something. I havn't heard of anyone mentioning TAMI, song number 7, in my opinion it is the best song. All the other songs are great too. There is absolutely NO FILLER SONGS.DO NOT PASS UP THIS ALBUM."
5,Best Album of the year!,"If you want to listen to hip hop on another level with tight production check this album out. Track 7 - T.A.M.I , is one of the illest songs. Don't listen to the dude who gave it 2 stars, his idea of good hip hop is Puff Daddy and Jermaine Dupri. This is real hip hop with the most lyrical flows ever."
5,Really super tool,"This stand off is well made and makes painting, paper hanging and all similar tasks much more friendly and safe. I can't imagine being up on a ladder without one! Also is a super ground level stabilizer."
3,Great illustrations; terrible text!,"Whoever wrote the adaptation of this movie did a terrible job. The text is not only bland but poorly written. It's hard for me to read it aloud exactly as written because it sounds so terrible.The only reason that I still gave this 3 stars is that your little ones probably already love the story of Aladdin & Jasmine, so they will like it even if you want to cry while reading it."
4,This machine is awesome!,"If you're serious about photography and you have a flexible budget, the i9900 will reward you with professional-quality prints in sizes ranging up to 13X19-inch posters. This machine can output borderless, edge-to-edge prints in all sizes. You'll get the best results from the best quality paper, but even on plain paper the i9900 produces impressive results.The Canon i9900 is not for the casual user. It delivers stunning photos with rich detail and vibrant, accurate colors, but springing for the best quality photo paper and replacing the printer's eight ink cartridges can put a serious dent in your budget. (Not to mention its up-front price tag.). That's why I am qualifying this printer as 4, only because of the price!"
5,Canon i9900,"I have always had Canon Printers and, although I have had to change them every 3-4 years, I have been amply satisfied with them. And Amazon.com has made them available for less than other retailers."
1,Great if you only want it for a year,"I bought this printer and it was great for a year. The photo printing quality was excellent. It was fast etc. Then it died, Canon service misdiagnosed the burnt board as a power supply issue first then wanted $300 for the repair. Others have reported the same here and elsewhere. Buyer beware on this one."
2,Loved Printer-when it worked,"Update - August, 2008: For a couple years, after the repair, the printer worked very well. I didn't use it often, but when I did, it was great. Now, it looks like the black print head needs to be replaced because text is fuzzy. I want to love this printer, but am having a hard time...April, 2005: Just this morning I attempted to turn on the Canon i9900 after it spent the last month ""resting"", turned off. It will not turn on. The printer is still under warranty, fortunately, but what a pain to ship it, wait, etc., etc.Otherwise, when it worked, I loved it. It was easy to use, printed beautiful color pages and was pretty quick. I'm really disappointed not to be able to use it now."
2,Cheap electronics,"Out of the box, the i9900 produced beautiful photo prints. I would have given it 5 stars then. After 1 year of extremely light use, the printer just died, a logic board failure. It would not even turn on. . nothing. I treated it very carefully, and I don't have any idea what could have caused it to fail. The warranty expired, and it doesn't make sense to fix it. I only printed about 20 prints on this machine, making my cost per 4X6 print about $25. If Canon would build in some better circuit protections, this would be a great machine. But now it is just an expensive but cheaply built disposable printer."
2,Installation,"As I am writing this I am listening to how much Canon cares (recorded of course).....After spending 1 1/2 hours trying to install the software I called, and actually got a human - helpful but not knowledgeable. After his spending 2 hours his conclusion was that it must be the way my Vaio PCG-GRT100P setup must prevent installation. Canon's is the only installation software that refuses to run on my Sony machine. I am now waitiing on the Scanner folks....yep got sucked into a 9950F. The 2 stars are for a pretty paperweight.....Still listening to how much they care...uh huh"
5,Just Great,"This i9900 is fun it makes you want to keep printing photos they are great looking Dont wait Just buy one, you will have some happy days, Before I got mine Iwent to canon cite and downloaded the software, its great I had every thing ready wen the printer arrived . Iguess thats it , gonna print some more pohtos"
1,Printer is DOA,"This printer cannot be installed. During Step One of ""Easy Install"", upon turning the device on, the printer makes a grotesque noise and then halts with an error light. Canon's telephone help is not available today, so now I get to wait at least one week before I can install the device.More later...."
1,Over priced ink and faulty feeds ruin another Cannon,"What needs to be pointed out is that yet again Cannon has set up an ink system that cost me more money than any other printer out there except the Lexmark's of the world. The number of photo prints you get for your money is ridicliously low. I felt jipped out of my money. Then the gravity style feed started feeding pages wrong by leaving these little white lines up either side of the page, so not only am i paying too much for my prints, but im printing non-useable prints then also. Does any one else smell a conspiracy?"
3,average at best,"photo quality was good. Inks were far too expensive for our use. Non-Canon ink purchases had some issues (too much draw of ink creating streaks, blotches, or a bit of leakage over a long period of use. Also, inks dry up too quickly. While not a function of the printer, it indicates that design is not well constructed to conserve. We took this unit out of service after 18 months."
4,The paper-jam proof printer,"I'm a graphic design student and I have been using this printer for printing comps for the last 3 years. the print quality is very good, although I must confess that my older HP photo printer gave me much better image quality, but the inks were too expensive and the paper feed mechanism was always breaking down. My Canon i-9900 has never clogged or had a paper jam in 3 years, and the inks are way more economic and last longer. I love that it prints up to 13"" wide. My only complaint is that the printer is a little bit messy with the ink and the print quality with non-Canon paper may not be awesome. However, you may expect great results if printing on Canon paper. I can use BCI-6 cartriges and even the new CLI-8 inks, although pricer, you can use them in case you can't your regular cartridges."
5,This is a great printer!,"I bought a Canon i9900 a year ago for $499 after a horrible experience with an HP CP1700. (See my review of the CP1700).I needed a high quality wide printer for photos and artwork, so after returning the CP1700, I bought an Epson 2200. I returned it after one day (too slow, and only worked with Epson paper).So I bought a Canon i9900. Finally! It was exactly what I wanted. High quality photos on any kind of paper, including heavy watercolor papers and cloth canvas.After a year of use and noticing that it's now $400, I wanted to give this 5-star recommendation for a great printer at a great price![...]"
5,Canon will put photo labs out of business...,"This is the most awesome printer! If you have a good high megapixel camera your photos will look just like they came from the photo lab, or maybe even better. The photos come out extrememly vibrant in color. It is incredibly fast, this is just an amazing printer. I printed out at least five 8x10's and a few 4x6 photos right away, and the ink tanks still look full. I was skeptical about spending this much money on a printer and it not meeting my expectations, it exceeded my expectations. I would highly recommend getting this printer if you are into photography. I was also very impressed with the Easy PhotoPrint software this came with. The Easy PhotoPrint software works very well. I can't say enough good about this printer. I'm very impressed."
3,not for scrapbookers,"I wanted a wide format printer for text, occasional photos & scrapbooking 12x12pages using paper & cardstock up to #67. I had called Canon to make sure this printer would work on the heavier paper, I was told it would. I was so disappointed when I opened the box & looked in the manual to find it only worked with paper up to #28. This was the first purchase I made through Amazon, so I was concerned about getting my money returned. It was no problem. I had my refund in a brief time. I gave it 3 stars even though I never used it but Canon needs to give out correct information to potential customers."
1,Will fail you in the end...,"I own this printer. I loved the quality of the prints. That's the only good thing I can say. Replacing the ink is very costly & this printer goes through lot's of ink quickly. This printer gets frequent clogged print heads. After about a yr or 2 of use expect to decide if u want pay lots of $ for a new printhead. Google for the i9900 printhead, & u will see many chats of people who have had printhead issues w/ this printer. Don't buy this thing. It will end up costing u more than it's worth!"
1,Crash and burn,"Very frustrating to trouble shoot print head problems and ink tank issues.Started out as a love affair. Ended up with desire to throw it on a junk pile.Treat this printer like a disposable lighter - get a cheaper one, and throw it away when you are done."
3,things not on website,actual product was shipped quickly and arrived in very good timebut they neglect to tell you in site info that it will be shipped via fedex signature required in person so that you can plan accordinglyfor shipment.customer service on these facts leaves something to be desiredsince i paid shipping and handling i expect to get to choose shipping options which are not allowed on web site.beware of hidden agenda all customers are not honest it seems in the eyes of vendor.not happy to pay freight and then have to go and pick up from fedex since actually work same time as fedex hmmmmmm go figure
5,It doesn't get any better than this!,"I've had my i9900 for about a year and have had nary a hiccup whatsoever. I've printed out hundreds of photos in all sizes on various papers; outstanding results! The only ""complaint"" I have is that it sucks down the photo magenta and photo cyan inks faster than the other inks but hey, with the results it produces, that's trivial.I noticed that a few of the one and two star reviews seemed to be written by those who have no idea how to either follow instructions or take the time to get to know the hardware. Granted, maybe some got hold of a bad production unit; Canon manufactures superb electronics but they're not perfect (but pretty close). One low rating was because it didn't come with a USB or Fire Wire cable. I've never bought a printer that included this so take these low ratings with a grain of salt.I would without hesitation recommend this printer for anyone who wants superb, lab-level results."
2,A Major Headache...Honeymoon is long over,"You'll love this printer initially and give it 5 stars, but just wait a few months. I've always had Epsons but thought I'd try this snazzy new model. I loved it - for a while.Months later....Canon replaced the head under warranty - which fixed the banding. However, the printer is now 14 days out of warranty, and the same problem has now recurred on the replacement head. I plan to chalk this up as one of those things in life and dispose of the printer before it gives me any grey hairs. Unless you really need it, don't buy a printer that has so many - eight - ink tanks. That's an expensive overkill.I won't again buy a higher end printer. Will only buy low end but well reviewed cheap printers and then toss them when they fail. The i9900 has taught me a lot about printers."
5,i9900 Review,"We purchased this item via Amazon on 11/3/05 - the lowest price available at the time (and still lowest as of Black Friday, 11/25) - and for $70 less than we could acquire it at an ""employee discount"" from a major electronics distributor where we work. AMAZING! That said, the item arrived a few days later by UPS Ground. The i9900 is a snap to set up, as are our other Canon printers, and produces fast and superb output. A bit on the noisy side, but then it IS a wide-format printer w/ lots of mechanical stuff to move 13"" paper. It enabled us to produce a high-quality graphics job for $1500-1800 less than if we had taken the files to a commercial printer + the convenience of doing the job totally in-house. Plus the cartridges can be drilled and refilled - another bonus."
2,Canon I-9900 Printer,"I was looking for a printer that could print CD labels and photos. After reading other reviews, I chose the Canon I-9900and I will say that I am very pleased with the printer. I compared it's print quality with that of a film print and can tell no difference in the quality of the print."
4,Color Bands on Prints,"This has been a terrific printer, except, after 4 months, color bands started ruining some of my prints. Canon phone service was helpful and sent me a refurbished printer with a new cartridge carrier. Wth expertimentation I discovered that the carrier was the problem. Now three months later the problem is starting again. Time for a new cartridge carrier? Seems to me they should last longer."
1,"Started out amazing, but not anymore","When I first bought this printer, I was amazed with the quality of the prints. I am an amateur photographer on the side, and was using this printer for my little business. My customers were thrilled, and so was I!Then, 3 months later, the quality of the prints started to deteriorate, and I could see horizontal bands in every picture. Canon had me drive an hour and a half to a repair shop, which I did. A full month later, still no word on what was going on. Turns out, they never figured out what was causing the problem. So Canon sent me a refurbished printer. Well, 3 months later again, same problem.Doesn't matter how much I clean the heads, etc., the bands are still there!Now, I'd just like to send the dang thing back and get a refund!!I have lost so many jobs and customers because of this printer. I wish I'd never bought it."
1,wrong one,"The one I got was not the one in the photo. I think it's the model that's one step below it.Now I have to return and etc. But they were fast about it (the return). And didn't have to pay for the return.I have some kind of trouble with my computer, I can""t change the star rating. Sorry."
5,Rez Band - Innocent Blood - An Eye Opener,"Dear Gospel Blues Lover,I don't believe that there was a review written for the ""Innocent Blood"" album yet. REZ Band (formerly Ressurection Band) really set the gospel blues on fire with this album. A lot of their former music was definitely heavy metal rock, but this album has the feel of Blind Willie Johnson (a great gospel blues musician). This album is not so much the praise and worhip style, but without a doubt, Gospel Blues. The kind that makes you reflect on how you are living your life with respect to God's word. Praise God, I love REZ Band's ""Innocent Blood""."
2,Very primitive...,"This light is functional, but feels cheaply made. Even though it has a 4 flat wiring bracket, only 2 wires are connected. The light turns on with your brake lights or with your right directional. It does not light with your left directional. If all you're looking for is a cap for your hitch and an extra brake light this will work. If you're a stickler for details you may need to look elsewhere."
1,"there is no LED to it, sorry","I have just got it, wanted to make it a nice combo with my LED tail lights but there is a light bulb, have no idea why they put the word LED in it!!! The price is great especially with free shipping with orders over $25, installation is easy, look nice as well, just when you think you get LED and it's NOT. Amazon should take LED off description. Maybe the more expensive version is real LED light, I wish I would try that now. Anyway every once a while this happens to you, this time it's only $12 item... whatever!"
1,El Cheapo Seat Cover,I was not happy with this seat cover. It was not made of very good materials and did not fit my full sized bench seat as advertised. It was a two piece cover and the half that covers the seat back was even worse fitting than the bench half.
2,not impressed,"This item was proffered as a cheaper version of the LED Maglite's. It does work, but it is not on the same level as the factory LED Maglite. Save your money and buy the real thing."
3,OK but Terralux 220 puts out over 2x the light,Buy the Terralux 220 flashlight and get 220 lumens. The most powerful 2AA flashlight on the market.
2,bad choice,"I only like two or three songs on this cd, tried to like it but would not buy it again. I really like jackie Wilson but no this collection"
4,Two weeks late,"I got it 2 weeks late, and got another one 2 days later, so now I need toreturn one of the CD's ."
3,Lost alot,"There's no question that Jackie Wilson was truly one of the pioneers of Rock and Roll, but this album really falls short. Some of his best songs (including the irrepressible ""Danny Boy"") are missing, and substituted are some rare, non-descript, mild hits that miss the marks. When Jackie had a hit, you knew it...when Jackie was trying to fill up an album, then that was what you got. If you are collector of Jackie Wilson records, then this one might be worth having, but if you are looking for the definitive one, you could probably find something more complete."
1,"""The Complete Raw Juice Therapy"" is WAY out of date","I purchased this book recently, thinking it was published in 1989, unfortunately,it was published in 1977 and the information in it is way out of date. There is a lot of new research on raw foods for health and to battle toxicity that is not mentioned in this book. New research has also uncovered toxins in some of the foods mentioned that any raw food eater might want to know about. In addition, in my copy, the author is not even attributed, in other words, there is no specific author mentioned, just the publisher. I do not recommend this book if you're interested in scientifically based and up-to-date information on raw juicing and raw food cleansing."
5,Haven't even seen the movie,"Yep, that's right--haven't even seen the movie yet. I stumbled upon this soundtrack at a used music store while looking for new music to choreograph to. It is an amazing CD, beautifully arranged and orchestrated."
3,pumps you up but doesn't let you down,"I have a heck of a time getting the lowering mechanism to work properly. Half the time, it jams and just spins. Often, I have to step on a ladder and almost have to take it apart to lower it. I'll keep them, but would not recommend anybody to buy them."
2,These things are a real pain to use,"I bought a pair of these pump jack at Menards, a midwestern version of a discounted Home Depot. They were about $20 cheaper a pair. Anyway, although these things do save time instead of climbing up and down a ladder, they are a real pain to use. They keep getting stuck when I try to lower them, and they even get stuck when trying to raise them. I've experimented with them and found out that on one pump jack, I had to make sure the crank used to lower the jack must be pushed into the square hole as per instructions, while the other pump jack didn't work this way. It didn't matter if The crank was in the square hole or not. And then when I wanted to raise the jack again, I had to use a hammer to knock the crank back out of the square hole since it wouldn't budge no matter what I did. I also STRONGLY recommend using braces every 10 feet of pole height to give the setup more horizontal stability."
2,Barely safe for amatuers useless for profesional.,"I bought 4 set of these jacks [8 jack, pole anchors, gaurd rails and braces] for my construction company. I was going to start doing the roofing and siding with my crew instead of subbing it out and these jacks seemed like a good way to get into it versus buying the more expensive aluminum pole set up. Boy was I wrong. It took 4 men 2.5 days to set up the poles adding that to the lumber required to install the jacks, railing, planks, and safety barior and I would have been better off buying the aluminum jacks.As for actually using the jacks, the system does not feel very secure even when installed per manufacturers recomendations. The whole set up sways.I give this product 2 stars becuase when in use you can get the job done but otherwise its a waste of time and money."
2,Qual-craft 2200 pump jack hangs up,"I too have had problems lowering these pump jacks. I used conventional 2x4's that were not douglas fir and I was told by Qual-craft that that was the problem. However, I also had access to a set sold by Lynn Ladder from a different manufacturer that worked fine with the same poles."
2,They barely work,Jacks were painted after assembly - which led to the parts jaming. Very difficult to get to work properly - often jammed and either wouldn't go up or wouldn't go down. Only instructions were on a sticker in micro font on the jack - could have used some pictures.
2,Slow Out of the Starting Gate,"Man, this is one drag of an album. His precociosness is such a boring act after awhile - so he can strum a guitar at 50,000 MPH and play a harmonica at the same time? There's a lot of imitation (""See That My Grave is Kept Clean"", like half the tunes, is a cover, and a pale one at that) but no soul. A couple of slow, pleasant tunes ""Baby Let Me Follow You Down"" and ""Song For Woody"" save this mess from utter destruction. But the quantum leap he takes from this dreadful debut to ""The Freewheelin'"" is one of the most amazing rock'n'roll stories in history. I'd start there instead."
2,could be better,"A little dissapointing.... So many of the songs are too similar and the style offers no break from repetativeness. There are some good songs, for sure, and even the whole album is interesting and maybe even good the first time you listen to it, but it certaintly doesn't beg repeated listening. one of my least favorite Dylan albums (and I have them all) Gems: Song to Woody, Baby Let Me Follow You Down, Freight Train Blues (Man he can hold that note)"
3,Interesting,I believe its Dylan first album and it is very good listening for a young bloke I enjoyed it but its not my favourite Dylan album.
5,My favorite overall Dylan record,I really like the sparseness of just him and an acoustic guitar. Most of the songs are fast and more like country blues than the protest folk songs he would later write. I cant believe the gravely voice on FIXIN' TO DIE and IN MY TIME OF DYING come from the baby faced kid on the front. He sounds like some 60 year old black man from the Mississippi Delta. Great powerfull music!
3,It may surprise you,"I think that anybody who's a Dylan fan or a fan of any traditional (truly ""folk"") music will appreciate this album. The tunes are catchy not in the sense that they may lead you to a fully roused, jumping state of exaultation; but I think that they are catchy in the slow, from deep in the depths of your stomach, ""let me sit down for this so I can feel it"", way which the old country blues and traditional music of Dylan's inspiration has always done. This is not his most political or original work, but from his voice, his melodic adaptations, and the album's song list comes the clear image of a young 20 y/o artist with great talent hidden between layers of insecurity and uncertainty. This album I hope may serve to draw renewed attention and appreciation to this relatively ignored style of music. Young musicians: study these roots and find what truth in them most appeals to your senses!"
4,We want folk singers here.,"This was Bob Dylan's first album, as you can probably tell by how young Dylan looks on the cover. Dylan only wrote two of the 13 songs on the album, with the rest being adaptations of folk and blues songs. Even at this young age, Dylan was a strong performer. He gives particularly powerful performances of ""Baby, Let Me Folow You Down"" and ""House of the Rising Sun"", but all of the performances are good. Of course, Dylan didn't really came into his own until the album after this one; when he blossomed into a great, totally orginal songwriter. But this is still a fine album that shows he was a talented performer even before he became ""The Voice of a Generation""."
3,"Great album, so-so remaster","The reissues of Bob Dylan and The Times They Are A-Changin' are excellent releases on their own merits. Still, I can't help but feel like both of these releases fall short of the phenomenal 2003 remasters of much of the Dylan catalog. Those discs were Hybrid-SACDs, packaged in cardboard cases that replicated the original album jackets and artwork. By contrast, these 2005 remasters are regular old CDs, and packaged in standard, generic jewel cases. Curiously, the 2003 series was issued on the Sony/Legacy label, while the 2005 titles are released by Columbia. This may account for the difference.Of course, the music is as great as it always was, and the remasters are much better than the old CDs. Still, it's troubling to see Sony taking a step back from the care that they had previously given to the Dylan catalog. Here's hoping Sony gives the future remasters of albums like The Basement Tapes and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid the consideration they are due."
2,It's OK...,"This being my second Dylan CD (after Freewheelin') I kinda knew what to expect. Some songs were good, but others weren't."
4,wild,"A strange, obsessively intense album - raw and desperate. Many songs are sung with a kind of violent energy, which seems to be hovering always over the brink of oblivion. This is the most death-obsessed album Dylan produced in his heyday, though that fatalisitic streak has more recently surfaced once again. He seems to want to inhabit the whole tradition of folk and blues pathos - his rasping, often almost screeching, voice often seems to rip these songs apart in its desire to possess them. Oddly the weakest songs are the two by Dylan himself. Both are mildly engaging, but show nothing which would suggest the creativity of the next few years. They also seem strangely out of place in this world of broken love and death."
5,Great family comedy,"The Lucy Show was on of the best tv comedies of all time. Easily in the top 10 if you were to make a list.The 3rd season has high and low spots. A few were only so-so quality. But many, like Lucy The Good Skate, were outstandingly funny.This show is far better than anything you can find in the modern tv wastland. Where else could you see Jack Benny and Bob Hope as plumbers, or Lucy trying to catch an escaped bird wearing a grass skirt and swim flippers and the insane events that set up the action?I look forward to the other seasons coming out. Hopefully the wait will not be long."
5,I Still Love Lucy,"You cannot go wrong with any of Lucille Ball's series, and the 3rd Season of ""The Lucy Show"" doesn't disappoint!"
4,Worth it for the Ann Sothern episodes,"This season of THE LUCY SHOW is not up to par with Season Two, or even Season One, however it was worth buying for me because I love the Ann Sothern - Countess Framboise episodes so much, especially ""My Fair Lucy"" with Sothern's former second banana and LUCY SHOW/HERE'S LUCY alum, the magnificent Reta Shaw. The color is fantastic, production values top notch. I was not disappointed in that, but some eps are just not worth a second viewing. Vivian Vance is a joy to watch in each ep, though."
4,The last season I'll purchase due to Vivian Vance's appearance,"The chemistry between Lucille Ball and Vivian Vance were something we all dream of. All the scheming they went through together in each episode. I have many of the ""I Love Lucy"" and first 2 seasons of "" The Lucy Show"" on dvd which I watch regulary.These two friends were magic. This is another season of watching their magic continue until Viv disappears in and out of the third season. In the ""lucy show"" episodes she tends to re-hash some of the plots from ""i love lucy"" for this show in particular.That's why I love Lucy and Viv forever!!!!!"
3,The Lucy Show,"""Lucy and the Ceramic Cat"" is the only time in the whole ""Lucy Show"" series that she utters the famous spider expression--""Euuuuuh.!"""
5,Can It get Any better ? I don't think so,"I am the proud owner of a Ducane 7100R Stainless Series grill. Just when I thought they had thought of it all, they come out with the ""Chuckwagon"". It's my grill on steroids. Imagine a grill with a fridge, umbrella, and beer tap (soda if you like)that you can keep on the patio, but roll to the car and load up it up in cinch. This is the ULTIMATE GRILL. Grill at home, on the road, at sporting events...you name it, this grill will be the envy of your friends and neighbors. I know that after seeing one, I will have 2 Ducanes now...what will they come up with next...a personal chef ? Way to go guys !!!! You can really get a an idea of this awesome grill at their website..www.ducane.com"
3,Too academic for my liking,"I am a manager of a team of 8 and I am looking to build my coaching skills. To that end given the fact that my company spends very little on management devlopment, I have to read as much as a can. I have bought several books on coaching and have found them either too academic or too life coach orientated with little emphasis on coaching within a business and management context.The Coaching Manager is certainly business orientated and has some useful examples to highlight the points emphasised although I did get the flavour of ""academia"" as opposed to real ""business experience"" coming through. I found it too lengthy in places and some chapters I will have to read again in order to fully grasp the learning from them.Having said that it will remain on my shelf (along with the others) and I will probably use it occasionally. I am busy manager and would prefer something a bit shorter and more practical."
4,Immediately Useful,"I read the last half of this book flying from Boston to Phoenix to coach one of my team members in a presentation. I was able to use the framework in this book immediately.As a result of reading the book, I told my employee that I would be using a new system for coaching and I asked my employee what he wanted to work on and what I should watch for. This gave me a framework for my observations.I also used the system they recommended to separate what I saw from my inferences.The resulting discussion was useful for both of us. I was able to say things like ""I saw that the audience was leaning forward and nodding. I took that to mean they were attentive. There was one woman who was leaning back and sort of looking around. I took that to mean she was bored."" then the employee said that she had seen the presentation before.I asked for his feedback at the end about my new coaching approach and he was very enthusiastic!Excellent system!"
3,CASPER THE PSYCHIC GHOST,"A straight to DVD release that's as predictable as this year's Oscars (except for CRASH of course). Real life hubby and wife Casper van Dien and Catherine Oxenberg star in this tale of a young cop who ""dies"" and is brought back to life---with strange premonitions that all come true. This includes an earthquake, a train wreck and an explosion, and of course, a terrorist attack as well. Van Dien tries to convince his wife and police chief (a sturdy Lorena Gale) that these visions are real, and he even stumbles onto a mysterious man who says he has them too.The special effects are right cheesy, and the whole movie reeks of cheepo, but it's entertaining on a subliminal primitive level."
3,Tries to recycle the formula of his first album and doesn't do such a good job of it,"The former member of Club Nouveau had a great album the first time around with his 1989 offering ""I Promise"" which featured a fresh, exciting mix of new-jack swing and tender ballads along with a hit cover of Stevie Wonder's ""Knocks Me Off My Feet."" A couple of years later he returns with this weak sophomore effort. Curiously, it has 2 songs tacked on from the 1989 album, and the original material doesn't jibe too well with those. He also goes for another Stevie cover (""All I Do""), which pales in comparison to Stevie's own. On the plus side, this album is more ballad-heavy, which gives him more of a chance to show off his decent voice, but it can only work so well without good songwriting, and in that area, this album lacks the freshness of its predecessor."
1,Bucket boss belt 88962,This bucket boss belt is made with cheap material and is not made for durability. I have had the same work belt for 15 years and have used it about every day of that time. And to be honest I still cant throw it away due to the cheap quality and lack of durability the bucket boss belt has. It isnt even a month old and at one end it has managed to some how start to split and will probably break before it has been used 6 months.
5,Good CD,"Great CD, great price, great service. I got a steal when I purchase this CD. I couldn't find this CD anywhere. Thanks for having it, and serving me so well."
5,catchy tunes help kids pronounce all the dino names,"as a pre-k teacher that does a big theme on dinos each yr, this product is an essential part of the curriculum...kids learn dino names, facts, songs without even realizing they are learning..."
3,"Cute, but ...","My four year old son is a dinosaur maven. He can identify more dinosaurs than most adults (including his very smart Mom). He enjoys this book and CD, and will sit and follow along, so it is worth having in that regard.It is pretty bad, though, when a four year old can correct them on pronunciation and facts. They pronounce Maiasaur incorrectly (may a sawr instead of my a sawr), Parasaurolophus according to the common but bad pronunciation (pa ra saw ROL o fus instead of pa ra sawr o LO fus), and they state that we can only guess what sounds Parasaurolophus made with its crest (when there's a convincing computer reconstruction of the sound on the internet for all to hear). They also show two Pachycephalosaurus butting heads even though this is almost ruled out by physics and you won't find any paleontologists who will endorse it.So, a medium ranking for nice idea, bad execution."
1,Wee Sing & Learn Dinosaurs,They sent an old library book and didn't include the tape to sing along. What good is the book without the sing along book in Wee sing and learn series?
5,This is it!,"I've been using these products over 5years.So far this is the best.I used so many different brand but all those products never satisfied me but Annemarie Borland.Good ingredients make a good product.Since I using this products, I don't have to go spa anymore!"
4,"Going Home, by Eve Bunting","As a grandfather, I have been impressed with many of the books which Eve Bunting, working with a variety of illustrators, has created for children. ""Going Home"" is one of these. With good drawings, and a simple, touching story, it is appropriate for almost any age. Recommended."
3,i would not recommend this for beginners,hard to understand her and too fast. she looks great and understands what she is talking about but not for me
3,"Versatile, durable, but very heavy","I've had the Little Giant Ladder for almost five years now. My ladder does not have glide wheels, but I have the work platform and the plank. It is very versatile. I've used it in all variations to do painting, gutter work, climbing on the roof, etc. It works as a step ladder and an extension ladder without wobbling. The downside is that it is heavy and when fully extended to 22 feet as an extension ladder it is difficult to handle by yourself."
3,A lot of ladder?,"This is a great idea for a ladder , however it's really heavy and complicated to adjust. I bought the sliding work plank and it worked great but it took me 30 minutes to set it up and another 30 to take it down. Would not recommend it to anyone who is not physically pretty strong."
5,Safety #1,Awesome ladder! This ladder is so strong and sturdy. I use it to hang outside Christmas lights and to paint my 18.5' tall walls inside. I'm sure future projects will require the use of this sturdy and safe ladder. Buy it now.
3,Great but heavy,"Biggest warning here is its heavy. 2nd warning is if you are using it as an extension ladder be very careful... two people would be adviseable to take it down... putting it up is relatively easy so long as the footing is solid so the ladder can't slide as you walk forward with the rungs. But getting it down is really tricky *(balance/center of gravity). In the end, solid, great wide bottom helps with stability. But heavy, wheels help manuever on solid ground. As long as you know what you are getting as far as weight and ability to get it up and down its a fair price and piece of equipment."
2,Not very SAFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I can't understand the obsession with this ladder. I had my just two days and realized that it's not all that safe. The rung's for your feet are very small thus not giving you a good footing. I have a size 10 shoes which is average and I didn't feel safe on the ladder. The rung's are smaller do to the ladders design about half the size of a normal ladder. I guess if you have small feet or really don't have to spend much time on the ladder then the rung size won't bother you, but in my view the ladder is unsafe, even my wife who is very small said it was unsafe as well. I hope people give this great thought before investing in such an expensive ladder. Thanks for reading my review."
3,Not the most convenient,"I've used the Little Giant on several projects since receiving and have determined it is far from convenient to use. I don't share the benefits given by the other buyers and have started using my standard step ladders again for convenience sake. You will find the Little Giant is ""heavy"" and cumbersome to move around."
5,Watch your contractors closely!,"My painter remembered to bring his shorter ladders, but forgot his longer one. I quickly pulled out this little bundle from the garage, and my painter hasn't yet shown up with his own ladder. I have to check him each day to make sure he hasn't ""accidentally"" taken my ladder with him, because he keeps threatening to.Unlike other folding ladders like this that we've both tried, this one is lighter and extremely easy to operate."
5,Awesome ladder,"I needed a ladder. I had seen the infomerical; but, I was skeptical and the price tag was a deterent. I decided to try it. In the past I was a little afraid of climbing the higher rungs on ladders because the ladders seemed so unsteady. This was not the case with this ladder. For the first time I was able to go higher than the second rung without having someone hold the ladder for me. It is very sturdy and heavier than other ladders. Yet it is not to heavy for me to move around. This is important to me being a woman with a bad back. I wish I had gotten this sooner."
3,MADE IN ....................?,"Little Giant's website has an American Flag at the bottom of the page stating that their ladders are Proudly Designed, Engineered, Assembled in the USA. Got my ladder today and it has Made in China stamped in to it.With the high prices they charge for these ladders, why can't they be stamped ""MADE in the USA"" I put the same comment on the Little Giant home page, but I know it will disappear and not be posted. USA needs jobs HERE!"
5,Excellent Purchase,"I really wish I would have bought the ladder system sooner, than dealing with my typical A-frame for the last 7 years. This ladder is configurable for darn near any job you may have, and will keep you comfortable and safe while doing it. From unlevel ground, to right up against a wall, to dizzying heights for Christmas lights.... this ladder is GREAT!!!"
4,Check the Fair,"Good ladder, be sure to have someone show you the easy way to use it. Check the fairs and trade shows, the guy there offered two extra accesseries for the same price , I bought mine from a store with training on the easy way to use it, nice real nice. My copy cat ladder I had taken back, got xtra play in the middle and I was using it the hard way, what a difference. Twice the price but worth it."
3,Beware. Amazon Has Incorrect Product Description,"As ""Bos ""MM"""" posted, Amazon is shipping the ladder without the ""Tip and Glide Wheels"". Since this is a feature of the latest generation Little Giant Ladder, I don't even know if the ladder also has the new Triple Locking Hinge.What a hassle. The first one I ordered came as described above; I thought it was an honest mistake so I dropped off the ladder and Amazon shipped another immediately. Unfortunately, the second ladder was the same product. I am returning the ladder and buying it instead from the official website.So I think there is a problem here. Amazon needs to either change the product description or ship the right ladder. Regardless, they wasted money for shipping two ladders to my place and back to their warehouse. It's their loss...Edit: 10/06/07 - I now notice that the product is no longer being sold by [...] but instead from ""Polsteins Home & Beyond"". That's just wierd."
4,Cost is still the same,"The product review states the ladder is sold on tv for $89 times 4 payments. The review also states the ladder is ""much less"". Lets see I added 89 x 4 = $356. You folks are selling the ladder for $359. Correct me if I'm wrong but there is no savings there."
1,Almost guilotined!,Be very careful not to lower ladder while holdingfrom the 15 foot position. Slid down so fast when i tried to lower from upright position neaely took off my hand. Lucky it was only black n bkue and sprained. Lower ladder to floor and make smaller from there
1,DECEMBER 2012 - Ladder now made in CHINA,"CONSUMER UPDATE : Dec.3,2012 Little Giant Ladders now making all ladders in CHINA. Disregard any previous made in usa advertising. Thank-you."
3,Don't Believe the Lifetime Warrany Claim,"I have had this ladder for 7 years and used it a lot. Loved it, very versatile. Last month I extended it to the top, climbed up and after about 15 seconds, it collapsed. Had some bruises/scrapes/sprained wrist, but nothing broken. During my fall the ladder where the 2 sections slide, split.The pins that lock the sections did not fully engage when I extended the ladder. They engaged enough for me to climb it and stand there before they gave way.Contacted Wing Enterprises several times over the past month with no luck. Spoke to manager Scott Hendrickson who told me quote, ""this happens a lot"". WHAT??? Are you kidding me? Told me I should have double checked the spring loaded pins and they will not cover it.Check around the internet, warranty is not as advertised. Anytime there is an issue, it's not because of the ladder, their stance is it's because of you. Tough Luck.All that being said, if you don't care about a warranty or falling, it's great."
3,too slow & boring,"I am giving it the lowest rating because it's the only honest unbiased one here. I just dont see how a jazz pianist mixing with a Flamenco accoustic guitarist will produce anything but an experiment in weirdness.This album bored me even more than Spain.Will accoustic Flamenco guitar fans accept Tomatito with a piano?Why not a violin, or a trumpet, or Joe Satriani next time?I like Camilo's lively jazz such as One More Once, Rendezvous, etc. not this. Is Spain & Spain Again w/Tomatito really worth $14 though?"
4,"Classic songs, brilliantly performed.","Marni Nixon, perhaps best-known for dubbing Audrey Hepburn's singing in the film version of ""My Fair Lady,"" turns in a simply magnificent performance here as she sings some of the finest pop songs ever written. The accompaniment by pianist Lincoln Mayorga and a small band is perfect and it is obvious that was a labor of love for both vocalist and ensemble. What keeps this from being a five star CD is the selection--some of the songs are not Kern standards, and considering the amount of classics Kern wrote, it seems that they could have chosen better songs than ""Californ-i-ay"" or ""Go, Little Boat."" However, this CD is a great collection of songs by one of the greatest songwriters of the first half of the twentieth century."
4,American Flyers,"A great movie for those that enjoy bicycle racing and riding and great mountain scenery. Combines a good balance of a well written story, well directed and excellent photography. Captures the thrill of bike racing set in the Colorado Rockies. But, the story is more than a race. Intertwined with the racing is a story of a family divided; two brothers and their mother, torn apart after the death of the father, and how the relationships a striving to mend themselves. If you liked Breaking Away, check this out."
4,Good growing book.,"Although most of the information contained in this book can be searched on the internet I still really enjoyed this book. It provided through information about Cannabis Culture around the world in the more well heard about parts (amsterdam, jamaica, ect.).As well as provided through growing information as well as great details about the plant. A very good book. Would recommend this to anyone who is interested in growing, or just interested in cannabis at that."
5,Spectacular compilation,"Not only are Zelda's poems ""spectacular,"" but Marcia Falk's opening narrative is insightful and well-written. I would like to read more by Ms Falk. This is a terrific compilation."
2,Not the best gift,"I bought this and had it sent to my sister in NY as a birthday gift for her little boy (toddler). She said he didn't play with it much, and she honestly wan't very impressed with it. I even had to ask her which vehicle she received, since the picture shows a bunch of them, but states that they are sold individually. I had no idea which one they even got (which I thought was kind of a bummer)! Also, their dog unfortunately got a hold of it quickly and bit one of the wheels off, so they couldn't play with it at all. I suppose one gets what one pays for."
3,Conch Republic - 3x5' Polyester Flag,"Very very thin material. Although the advantage is that it picks up the slighest breeze. Good product for the price. And yes, I would easily but it again!"
4,Great for Portrait shots,"Handy for portrait shots. It does NOT shorten the recycle time for the build-in flash by much. I used to Canon batteries in the grip. Expensive as in the tradition of Canon's add-ons. Mines' made in China. The shutter and other parts are a notch below what's on my 350D body, but of very usable quality. The tripod mount feels solid. I am surprised that my brand new 580EX flash, which is made in Japan, isn't all that great in fit and finish either - it squeeks and kinda loose when moving the flash head around. My 420EZ flash has the same problem, but that's a 20 year old piece. And my EOS 630 body (20 year old) is also of better fit and finish than the Rebel 350D. Tried a new 30D body at a local circuit city couple of days ago, the build quality is also quite so-so. As it says, ""they don't build things like they used to these days""..."
2,Do you really need it?,"After thinking about purchasing one for couple of month, finally I pulled the trigger due to the price. I am a casual photographer and not a pro by any mean, however, when I go for a shoot whether it is nature, or portraits etc I take a lot of pictures usually between 200-300 pictures. I received my package, unpacked it, installed the battery grip since I already had 2 charged batteries. First it seemed very nice to have especially for portrait shots, however and after 10 minutes or so, your hands start getting sore, this thing is heavy added to your camera. Also, I have small hands so I have to produce and overhand grip which strains my hand a little bit. Another thing is that the sling of the camera always gets in the way, with the battery grip it became more noticeable. In my case, that product did not improve my experience. Thus a 2 star."
5,A geat buy!,The BG-E3 BATTERY GRIP is a great addition to my Canon XTI. The grip adds more space to hold the camera(for people with big hands) and adds some weight to the camera so it feels like your holding something. Plus I got it a low price and on time.
4,Nice but does not help my big hands,"I purchsed primarly to have a better way to hold on to the camera since I have large hands, this does not give you any more grip except when using the camera in the verticle position (then it's a big help due to the 2nd button position on the battery grip). With two batteries this adds a lot of weight to the camera, so don't buy this unless you really need to have two full battries to extend your shoot time. Well made and works great, just not much help with the grip of the camera for me."
1,Manufacture Defect,"Order the first one last week and I found that the corner of the leather on grip was peeling off. Thus, I reported to Amazon. the shipping was ultra fast and I got the replacement the next day. However, the same problem was found on the replacement. I am really disappointed to this product."
1,Canon BGE3,"Love it, but the battery door does not lock down tightly - feels a little loose even when in the locked position."
5,Battery Grip Experience,"I took the plunge and bought the BG-E3 Battery Grip from Canon. After reading the reviews of the off-brand model and deciding that I didn't want any 'button' problems, I got the Canon. I'm VERY happy with it, (not from the standpoint of having the extra battery capacity because I have 2 batteries at all times anyway) but because I like the 'look and feel' of having the additional weight and fit for my large male hands. I felt that without it, I might drop the camera at any time and while it's safely suspended about my neck, I don't like that feeling.I also like being able to spin the camera for portrait or landscape shots very quickly and cleanly and having that extra set of buttons available to change the Tv and Av settings for various effects. I got some exceptionally nice photos of a waterfall and this made it easy to use. If you're thinking about buying it, it's worth every hard-earned penny and should significantly enhance both professional and amateur uses."
5,EXCELLENT CANON GRIPP for XTi,I highly highly recomend this product. feels great product. This is something people should invest it especially for holding the camera right. I have a Canon XTi and it feels so much better with it on. No joke. everyone should get one. Trust me you would love it
5,Xti + big hands == necessity,"* The Xti is a small camera. If you have large hands, then this makes holding it a much more pleasureable affair.* It holds two batteries. Kind of cool to be able to shoot twice as long without switching.* It has copies of the basic camera controls on the side, so that when you're shooting in the vertical format you can still hold the camera naturally. Cool.Price is perhaps a little steep. People say the Opteka is just as good and 2/3 the price. I never checked it out."
5,Canon battery grip,"Compliments the Canon Digital Rebel XT camera very well. The ease of operation and the professional feel of the camera, makes the investment of battery grip worth every penny. I am very pleased with the product and suggest that any body with the Canon Digital Rebel XT camera up-grade to this fantastic grip."
5,Camera Battery Grip,This battery grip is a great addition to the camera bag. It allows the use of 2 batteries which gives more shooting time. It also has a AA battery sleeve for emergencies when both batteries are dead and you just need a few more shots. A friend recommended that I get one and I am glad he did.
5,It's cheaper to buy the kit,"Consider buying the grip kit. It includes two 1500mAh batteries (the OEM Canon are 750mAh). The kit costs less than buying a grip and batteries separately, and you get a couple of other things thrown in the kit as well for ""free"". See this linkCanon BG-E3 Battery Grip Grip for EOS Digital Rebel XT + Accessory Kit"
2,Motorola L2 SLVR,"Thin, lightweight and easy to use. The only problem I've found with this phone is the speaker, which is on the side near the palm of your hand. The speaker works well, and the battery life is pretty good. Overall I've been happy with this phone, and even replaced it when the first one was stolen.UPDATE: 1/19/12This phone ended up being a huge annoyance. Although I love the feel of it, there were a lot of problems with pocket dialing. And to top that off, I'm pretty sure it was an import. The phone came with a European adapter and would never work properly with my carrier. So many problems. I was sad to upgrade, but happy at the same time. Now it serves as a toy for my 2yr old nephew."
2,Poor production standards,"The anchor proved convenient for placing poles without digging anchor holes, but the box welded to hold the poles seems to have been made to accommodate full-dimensional 2 by 4s since they provided such a loose fit for D2S. Additionally, the box was not welded square."
5,Good quality!,I really loved the gas mask. Im looking to buy more soon. Also the mask fits all sizes because you can easily adjust it.
2,Appears used and canister was dented badly.,The mask came in a loose plastic bag and looked used with smudge marks on the lens and scuff marks. The mask seem to fit well. The canister that it came with was dented pretty badly.
1,no date on filter...,i wouldve gave it a four out of 5 but the filter is useless it has no date so it cant be trusted this is supposed to save lives and if you dont kno if the filter is expired or new ur gambling with your life on the brightside the mask fits perfectly sucks to your face when inhaling and pulls away when exhaling also a small nick on the left eye other then that its fine just bad filter good for a prop not good for life and death situation
2,Scratched Lenses,"The mask works and fits good just can't get past the scratches on both lenses, really takes away from the product."
3,No Dates On Filter,"If you purchase this, plan on buying new filters. The filter that came with the mask came with tape on it which had been broken. So no seal and no expiration date means that I don't trust it. I'll purchase new NATO filters from other outlets. Other than that, the mask is fine and provides a good seal."
4,Decent,"I was really excited to get this gas mask, and when I opened it, It seemed really cool! However if you do buy this the filter that it comes with, it is most likely expired. Mine expired in 2003 so it won't do much good in a situation where i would need to use it for real. This gas mask would provide useful protection if you buy the filter NEW and separately, but other than that the mask is really comfortable and easy to use."
3,Good product.However...,"...There is no expiration date you can read (unless you can read hebrew). Good for immediate emergency but i suggest that you buy a separate canister,if you plan to survive some type of nuclear strike. It's easy to put on and adjust and you can clearly see. Good quality-price. If wasn't for the canister,i would've give it 5 stars."
4,get them while you can,"this mask is very well made, fits very good too, an with the batman shooting you might wanna order while you can im sure the goverment is going to go after this ""TACTICAL GEAR"" with all they got now."
5,Effin awesome,I love it. It fits perfectly and is just plain out fun to wear. It looks bad @$$ too. I'm set for the nuclear war and haloween lol
4,Almost got what I ordered,I ordered this product last week and it arrived 7 days later. Not bad. I was impressed as soon as I opened the box. The gas mask was neatly packaged with the filter tucked inside and unopened. I took it out and tried it on and it's a great fit. It seems like a quality product. It also fits very comfortably. I would have given it 5 stars but as the pictures and details/notes show it was supposed to come with a drinking tube. I have contacted the seller thru Amazon and hope I will have one shipped very soon. If the seller does not send a drinking tube I will definitely let all of you know. Very misleading advertisement if they don't send one!
5,Exactly what I ordered.,"I bought this gas mask for my 12 year old son for Halloween - we were not purchasing this mask for any reason other than fun. This product was exactly what we expected. It was comfortable to wear, it was good quality, and is a legitimate mask at a great price. I don't know anything about the expiration of filters. Some users posted that their filters were expired upon receipt of the mask - but I don't have any complaints. In this case, what you see, is exactly what you get."
4,Great,"Used in dark room while doing maintenance, filter smelled odd but worked great. Mask fit well and comfortable for a mask."
5,Good product,"Fit Well,able to aquire targets and fire weapons with no problem with mask on. Only thing missing is a carry bag,but fits in my tac vest"
5,Worked well for Halloween!,Bought this for the Halloween and love it. It is a real gas mask and can be used for emergency.
2,Can't Rely On It,"This mask looks ok, and it might work, but since there is no information included with it and all the writing is in Hebrew, it's impossible to tell how old the filter is and how long ago it might have expired. Therefore, I can't rely on this mask and its one included filter, should I have the need to actually use this. Replacement filters are difficult to find are are expensive ($30+ each)."
3,"Well, it *is* a gas mask, however...","So I bought this kinda specifically for the drinking tube. I didn't care too much about the expired filters that I read about (which mine was also expired, since 2004) but I was kinda angry that there was no drinking tube AT ALL included, despite the product clearly stating there would be such a tube. Also, the lens was marked with what looks to be green-ish paint when I opened it (only on one lens, but it's not *that* big to make an obstruction in the vision, just very annoying, like having a smudge on your glasses that you cannot remove)However, the seal works very well and I imagine this would serve its purpose in an environment around CS gas or Tear Gas or if you were spraying your lawn or whatnot."
1,Expired,Ordered two masks. They both expired in 2008. This is really immoral practice considering the nature of the product. Seller really has an obligation to state that these are for novelty or costume use only.
2,The mask is great... Usually.,"I used to own one of these things (exact same model), but a long series of events led me to giving it away to my friend's girlfriend. Eventually, I missed it, and ordered this one.While the first mask was absolutely perfect in every way, the one I got from Amazon was damaged, and as such I don't trust it for NBC uses. There's something wrong that makes it so when inhaling it vibrates and shudders very violently and makes a loud noise. I also cannot get it to make an airtight seal.I guess some of the masks are great, and others damaged."
2,Expired Filters?,"The mask is a decent mask that will do the job, God forbid, in case it is needed. However, be careful who you buy from. The filter is expired. I'm having a hard time locating a new filter. The way it was packed, the filter was inside the mask. If they would have put the filter in a plastic bag, it would probably not have scratched the lenses. I don't understand why attention to detail is not important anymore."
2,okay,"This mask kind of sucks, i got mine with scratched lenses, its pretty beat up, but fits fairly well. Overal shipping was okay but im pissed about the lenses"
2,Good mask but bad seller and etc.,I bought this gas mask for use against paint tear gas etc and I do like it but beware the seller lies about it having a canteen straw there was none in the box also do not wear for over 30 minutes as it gives headaches and becomes very hot. overall a bad product and bad seller do not buy this as the seller lied to me about the straw
5,No Drinking Tube,Just received my mask. It works really well. I didn't apply the filter but the seal is tight and it only draws air through the connection area where the filter should go. It seals very nicely and it is made of nice material. This is the real deal. The eyes are perfect and you can see out of them nicely. Would buy again. Five stars even though mine did not come with the drinking tube.
5,Just the ticket!,"What do you get a friend who's worried about mosquito spraying? Why a Israeli Gas Mask! that's what! These little beauties with their NATO cartridges not only keep out nerve agents, Nuclear fallout and unseemly fart odors but they also work like a champ to keep from accidentally inhaling bug spray as delivered by truck or airplane...and at 20 bucks a pop? c'mon they're a steal!"
2,works,"cannot be used comfortably with glasses, but in a pinch tis better than no protection, shloud have warning that it's not for people with glases"
1,No good,Arrived with scratches almost would say it was used before. Not satisfied with the quality of this product. I'm not happy with this item and would not recommend this to anyone.
5,Not bad.,"It's a good mask and easy to get a proper seal if you know what you're doing. The mask I received did not come with the hydration attachment, contacted the seller and they shipped me one immediately.Even with filter being expired, I'm quite certain it still serves it's purpose for regular use such as paint or solvent fumes.If medications and MRE's can still be good and effective way past their expiration date then why wouldn't a sealed filter?If you're expecting biological warfare or anything, just get a new filter at a military surplus store, duh.I saw a lot of people complaining about scratched lenses. At first glance the lenses on the mask I received appeared scratched as well, but when I wiped them with a wash cloth, they were pretty clear.Not sure what people are expecting for $20 but I bought it for basic needs and probably a costume accessory at some point.Again, it's a good mask."
4,Israely gas mask,I used the gas mask while stripping the hardwood floor from a glue. It worked fine. Minimum fog on the lenses. I comfortably worked for 6 hours. The rubber is a little raw. You fill it after couple hours. The filter cartridge stops the stripper stink. It can not stop completely aceton smell
5,Fast shipping...awesome product.,"I placed an order for 4 of these masks on July the 2nd. Figuring with the holiday weekend and all I didn't expect the package to arrive until next week sometime. When I got home from Transformers III tonight (July 5th) I was pleased to find it sitting on my door step. The masks are all packaged the same and are in really good shape. I couldn't help but break one out and try it on. The seal fits quick and snug without any discomfort. I'm a firefighter and we use Drager SCBAs, so I'm used to breathing through a mask. I got these for the 'just in case' factor and I'm also planning on using one for physical training. Studies have shown that when you train with a mask on it helps simulate high altitude environments.So if you live in the back woods and are worried that the Man is coming to get you or if you're just a wanna be MMA fighter I would recommend this mask. As for Transformers III.....well, its a lot like the first two. In the end the good guys win."
5,I go this to clean out my moms basement and in case of a fallout scenerio.,I am a firefighter with hazmat certs and I keep one of these in my truck just in case. I might pick up a few more for the lady in my life.
5,very good gas mask,"This is a very good mask.It has a drinking tube,a nato filter,and it has a very good seal.It will work for any gas emergency."
5,Good product!,"Fit just right! Was brand new! Filter was good as well! A must have for all the ""doomsday preppers""! 5 out of 5 stars!"
5,Essential item,Item was delivered as described-Brand New w/Filter. Great Service! Essential item for possible future needs. Better to be safe than sorry!
2,No instructions,Hopefully this product works when the SHTF. There aren't any instructions. What you see in the pic is what you get.
1,Poor fit on my face,Didn't really fit my face very well. Have to hold it with one hand to keep it airtight. Very inconvenient.
4,Awesome and Affordable Mask Gas,"This product is good. I tried out some several gas mask used by other countries and this one was one of the good one. Its affordable, low costing, and the filter doesnt really need changes unless you use it. One thing that I find bad is that the lenses fog up for some reason in the heat or when humidity is high. Get it while its low costing."
3,Hmm.,"I don't mind that the filter is expired, reading the reviews I expected this. However, when I received this item both ""eyes"" are scratched up...on the INSIDE.Glad I didn't spend more than $25. Another lesson in you get what you pay for."
4,Comfortable fit,"Purchased this mask for my 11 year old son who wanted it for his Halloween costume. He states it is comfortable and looks ""cool"". I was happy with the price. It came with a new unopened filter so I guess he will be ok if we get gassed!"
4,Nice,"Great gas mask, no damage good quality etc...but i just purchased it and it is not the kind that fits hydration tubes, nor did it come with one....but on the image for this product it displays a hydration tube...so I kinda got ripped off."
4,Very good budget respirator,"So far I've used mine around all types of solvent and oil based paints as well as water base. I've used it with other harsh chemicals and sanding various materials. When sealing the canister with my hand and inhaling, there is the SLIGHTEST leak that otherwise never seems to effect the performance with the canister functioning as intended.I've smelled fumes maybe 3 or 4 times when putting my face right on top of a freshly painted item or directly over the container of chemicals.The only complaint is, it fogs easily in slightly cool to cold temperatures and with the lenses being modest, you are working in turmoil. If working temperature is not an issue, have no reservations. Aside from which, there are of course cheap anti fog treatments and I've just not gotten a chance to grab one."
5,GREATEST MASK EVER!,I would definitely wear this in a gas attack. I wore it during the may 21 when people thought it was the end of the world. I bought 2 and now I wish I bought more! I recommend this to anyone who sees this review
4,Israeli Civilian Gas Mask w/ Nato Filter,The product was purchased for the use in the chemistry laboratory to protect from the residual toxic gas leaks. It functions well.
4,Good deal,"Comes with a drinking tube, if I would of bought a different one it wou,d have been the military issue one that has larger lenses."
2,Much too Small,"Even with the adjustable straps, the mask itself is too small. I'm not saying that it can't fit my head, the rubber front section with the mouthpiece and eyepieces itself is too small for my face. If I insert my chin in the chin holder, my eyes are too far up to comfortably be in the mask.My head and face are the size of a normal person. The mask I received seems to be one for a 10 year old."
5,Great Mask,"bought this mask, tried it on and it fit perfectly. Its breathable, adjustable and doesnt fog. Its a great mask time to scare people on the streets for holloween :P"
3,Gas mask,"The gas mask appears to be fully functional and effective. However, there were no instructions included with the mask or the filter so only my past experience and training with such devices allowed me to use it correctly. Even instructionsIn Hebrew would have been helpful."
2,"Dirty, old, & used","Lenses are scratches, the inside of the mask smell like chemicals, the mask inside is dirty, the tube where you drink inside the mask is either white paint or bird s***, IT DOESN'T EVEN come with the HYRDRATION TUBE (WTF!) the chin part of the mask is musty dust that i can't even clean off. Overall I'm not satisfied"
3,"Yes, 'you stole it'","Three stars since I didn't read much of it, and my quasi-Buddhist generous mind. Have worked and partied with my share of Indians over many years: some smart, some dumb, some hard working, most mellow, some quite tempermental. As with thousands in the US, we haven't found it funny to personally witness companies replace their IT staff with Indian H-1B or L-1 consultants and flooding the job market. What's 'better' for companies is that most will work for less. There are good Indian programmers but very few outstanding ones. As long-time columnist John Dvorak points out, he's seen no popular apps from Indians; I agree as I work with much world-wide open source software and see very few contributions."
1,Stealing the economy,"This book should be filed in the dumpster. Just like what is happening to the U.S. We are giving away all of what this country was founded on to other low income slave labor countries all because CEO's want to cut costs. Just like blude collar manufacturing was given away so will all white collar jobs. That just leaves low paying service jobs left in this country.The U.S. will lose its Superpower and soon China and India will be the next superpowers and hold the U.S. hostage with huge export charges which will jack up prices on all goods they currently produce. And since the U.S. no longer manufactures anything, we will be a country without industry. Reminds you of Communism, doesnt it ??WAKE UP PEOPLE, THIS IS NOT GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY."
3,Middle school essay,"The book would make a good middle school essay, the language is very primitive. I am an immigrant myself, and if I ever wrote a book, this is how it would look like.The author can not neither develop his thought nor follow it to come to any logical conclusions, his arguments are far-fetched and conclusions are rather strange.In general, he pictures Indian immigrant community as rather shallow people, just look at a few observations he makes:- ""everything we do is to satisfy Mr.Stomach""- ""the guy is in the survival mode""- ""I take safety over freedom any time"".We have our share of cross-cultural misunderstanding between Indian and other immigrants, but the picture he draws is too dark and does not sit well with my experience."
4,Aiming for the American dream with the taste of Bollywood...,"The author has shown the struggle, in Bollywood style, that every Indian Progammer goes through while aiming for the American Dream. Are we really sure that this is what we want, read it and decide for youself. You will be surprised how Sivakumar has amazingly remembered minute details of what you and me have gone through, at some point, since our arrival to the dream land."
4,A serious book with lots of humor,"This is an amazing book delivering the truth with so much humor. What impressed me is the way he discussed the cultural issues and brought out the other side (American) of the tstory with honesty and openness. He addressed the whole crisis of Asian immigrant workers, outsourcing and the American people losing jobs at the macro and micro level, never forgetting the fact that ultimately it is the individual who is at pain on either side. While dealing the issue, through out, he kept the interests of all the groups caught in the crisis and suggested the anti-immigrant groups to take a pause and think it over."
3,"Acceptable,, but not memorable.","Readers of Dorothy Cannell's ""The Trouble with Harriet"" may be disappointed. After such wonderful stories like ""The Thin Woman"" and ""How to Murder the Man of Your Dreams,"" ""The Trouble With Harriet"" drags with little humor and passages more suited to dramatic soliloquies. More time was spent on Ellie's father's bouts of depression and ill-humor than I thought was necessary and the premise of the mystery itself was a bit bland.I'd really like it if one of these books were to take Ellie and Ben away from Chittendon Falls on a holiday and then shove them headlong into a mystery....but please! Let's get these two together without the kiddies and Freddie lurking about. Frankly, I'd love to read more of Ben.Although the book was acceptable, I found myself skimming and skipping, a sure sign of boredom with a story."
5,Seven Blind Mice,This is an excellent book especially for Kindergarten or lst graders. It is great to use for predicting and keep a young readers attention.
3,Seven Blind Mice,"The book Seven Blind Mice is about seven blind mice that notice something unusual by their pond. Each of the mice goes to the pond to investigate the object. After each one comes back from their investigation they have a different result from the others. Until the white mouse goes to investigate and comes back, and tells them that it is all of the things they said it was. The lesson that this book teaches is that you can all have your own opinion, but you'll be smarter if you look at everyone's. This book should be read by children ages four through seven because I think anyone younger wouldn't understand, and anyone older would think it is uninteresting. I thought that the book was good, but a little boring. It lost my attention half way through the book."
5,"Beautiful Book, both words and illustration","This children's book is not only a wonderful tale but it also uses beautiful illustrations that only enhance the story. The book would be an excellent resource for teachers to use when teaching about morals, the importance of taking your time, or even collages (art). This is a wonderful book with a strong moral story line and exciting, eye catching pictures."
5,Find your way,"This is a great story about seven mice who are trying to find their way around the big pond. In the story, the mice learn how to look at the overall picture instead of just what lies in front of them. This book teaches children to do the same in their own lives. This is a great picture book for young children. I would recommend this book to any parent or teacher who is looking for a simple book to read. The illustrations are also very bright and great for getting the attention of small children. I like this book because it is such a easy read for children of all ages and because of all the bright and colorful illustrations."
5,Stunning Illustrations,"The kids were mesmerized by the illustrations. It is a good thing that the retelling of this tale is well done, otherwise the illustrations could easily overpower and diminish the prose.This is a classic, but I keep it in a special place to hand out as a reward for a job well done in the classroom. The kids can't just go up to the bookshelf and take it out during silent reading or choice time because a tug of war over turns or who got it first is inevitable. I don't want a torn book as the result of their loving the it.This is a wonderful story in its own right taken to a whole new level with these illustrations. I think an art teacher could create several inspiring lessons based upon these illustrations. Highly recommend."
5,Great shoes,Kenneth Cole shoes are the most comfortable and casually classy shoes. I'd reccommend to anyone. These are VERY comfortable on the foot. at 6'4 250 its rare to find shoes that both look good and dont kill my feet. Every KC shoe ive ever had has been all aces.
2,Disappointed,"This book was not what I was looking for, too dark, all of the seasons in the book are dark."
2,The Brothers Showed They Use To Be The Real Deal,"The McCampbell Brothers produced, arranged (vocal arranged), and played multi-instruments (bass, guitar, percussions, flute, trumpet, sax, and even layed down raps) on their 91 release The Real Deal and worked with a highly skilled team; Club Nouveau's Mikki Bleu (toured with Con Funk Shun and The Gap Band), very capable musician Chuckki Booker (Barry White's God Son), Cornelius Mims and producers Darrin & Tone Z. The Real Deal hit a high no. 78 on the R&B/Hip-Hop Charts, and the lead single ""Everythang"" hit a astonishingly high no. 73 on the R&B singles chart, but this shouldn't reflect the single's credibility. Its sad to see a group that only four years ago had a number one hit (""Roses Are Red"") and fall out of the publics eye so quickly."
3,low budget but good story,"This movie is a bit frustrating, it's an excellent story but it's treatment is second rate, a B movie that should have been done with an A director and a better budget. Clint Walker is great as usual but he can't do it alone. The futuristic tale suffers from a feeling they didn't want to pay extras to fill out the landscape. A very young kim cattrall is average but shows her potential. The dvd quality is poor. But given that the story itself is very interesting and Walker's portrayal is very good."
1,Overpriced.,"This book is way overpriced. Yes, the general flow is alright, but I wouldn't pay more than $20 for this book."
4,It is OK.,"It is OK, except that it is not hardcopy, which I knew when I bought it. And I have to protect it very carefully."
3,little defect,"A little wrap in the right corner,i didn`t know where is from,maybe in the delivery. That`s what i unsatisfied with!"
1,This book is worthless,I used this text in my graduate-level spectroscopy class and my opinion is that it is completely worthless! It is unreadable and frustratingly lacking in examples and instructive ability. Stay away - you are better off using Harris and Bertolucci.
5,Sublime,"Nothing I can say about this CD will do it justice; it's superb. Simultaneously complex, clean, hypnotic, seductive, and reverant. El Din's voice and singing are impeccable and the instrumental work is brilliant.If you enjoy this CD, then I highly recommend the work of Catherine Braslavsky and Joseph Rowe, particularly the CD ""From Jerusalem to Cordoba"". [...]"
5,Lyric and beautiful,"Rumi, a 13th century Sufi poet, writes of love in the Sufi sense - that is to say, love to the divine, and a recognition of the divine in all things - in a rooftop, a cup, dust. On another level, Rumi also writes of the nature of love - uttery surrendering yourself, giving yourself over completely. The collection of poems here are wonderful, in a beautiful translation. The art included is also beautiful, although they are by one of the translators and not by Rumi himself, as another reviewer thought.The book, in short is a thing of beauty - as love is. Highly recommended."
2,Great tool!,"I have owned this item for four years, and use it regularly in my professional chimney sweep/restoration business. It's easy to set up, light weight, and versatile. I have every confidence in it, and routinely trust it with my life several stories above the ground!"
4,"Bees, wonderful bees","I love tis book! I am trying to learn as much as I can about bees and this is a must read for people like me. Bees are a big responsibility, like another pet, and this book helps you understand what you are going to face and how much enjoyment you will get out of this wonderful hobby. Read it!"
4,True Believer&#65533;,"""The Book of Mermaids' is the quintessential encyclopedia of Mermaidolidgy. Where they swim, how they play, what's hot and what's not in the captivating world of mermaid culture are just a few of the topics skillfully explored in ""The Book of Mermaids."" It's the perfect choice for every true believer and mermaid lover."
2,great seller,"I purchased this book and when I got it, it wasn't what I thought it was. The seller was very nice and offered to refund the money right away. The only problem is that I tried to contact them about returning the book and was unsuccessful- I still have this book even though they refunded me and I want to give them their book back! Very responsible, fair seller."
5,Best Movie EVER,"This is sure to be a cult classic someday!!! Somewhat funny, even tho a horror movie - just like the true classics are!"
2,Not quite what I wanted,"This book only covers human / medical biomaterials. It wasnt' really clear from the information online that that's it. If that's what you want, it's probably very good - but I am much more interested in non-humans (animals and plants and stuff)."
2,Really disappointed.,"Bought two of these, one for my daughter and one for my niece for Christmas. I already gave my niece hers and was ashamed of my gift to her. I would have thought it was like a dance machine and when the flower lights up on screen you are supposed to put your foot on that flower. Oh no. All you do is hit the flower and one of the ballerina dances. That's it. the graphics are horrible so you can't even tell which flower you are supposed to hit. They're not even the same color! The graphics are horrible. And did I tell you that graphics were horrible? I'm embarrassed this present came from me and now I have to realize what to do with the one I was supposed to give my daughter."
1,tricky....and a dissapointment!,"This was very dissapointing!! my daughter was so excited to get it and could barely use it. the mat is supposed to be color coordinated with the screen however the colors seem to be all the same shade. The mat looks like it comes from the dollar store, or they ran out of color at the factory. My daughter asked her sister why mommy got this ugly one....not like the box or commercial!!"
1,Do Not Buy This Toy,I wouldn't even give this toy one star if I wasn't forced to. Mattel should be ashamed of themselves for putting out a product with 1980's graphics and even worse sound. It sounds like my husband's 1985 Casio watch. The only thing they did well with this product is market it. I gave this to my daughter from Santa and I am still going to return it.
3,Don't buy it.,"This item, to be blunt, sucks. The graphics look like garbage, you have to buy batteries for it, my daughter doesn't even play it because it doesn't really work all that well. I couldn't figure out how to play this stupid game either."
1,is that all???,doesn't do much for the price. basically your daughter watches the ballet dancers on the tv screen & tries to follow along. it's not even step by step & frankly it's somewhat difficult to follow. wish i had spent my $$ on something else. :(
1,Complete waste of money!,"I bought this for [...]daughter for Christmas this past year. It's just awful! The graphics are bad, half the time the mat doesn't work right. You have to step just so. And it's boring! My daughters have used it once since Christmas. Not at all what I thought it would be. I believe there are two seperate versions of this particular toy, one that comes with an interactive DVD and this one that plugs directly into the TV. If I had to do it over, I'd definitely go for the DVD one. As it is, I will most likely donate or toss this one."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!,"This DVD will definetely be the best of the entire chapter black saga! I haven't seen it in japanese but i have a rough idea about what is going to happen. A lot of cool stuff happens in this one. You get to see Puu in a whole new way. You even get to see Yusuke in a whole new way. And, the best part (for me at least) is that you finally find out who Yusuke's second parent is. All you see on the tv is his lush of a mother. You have got to get this DVD and I promise you, it will be the bomb!"
5,a shocking story that blows your mind off,"i got this dvd at best buy and it was great. yusuke dies, giving kurama, hiei, and kuwabara greater powers as the chase sensui through the completed tunnel. in spirit world, king yama sends the spirit world special defense force to earth commanding them to take yusuke's dead body so it can never be revived. in this dvd, you'll hear something about yusuke so surprising."
5,Get it right!,"Yusuke's parents are human. 44 generations ago the S-class demon Musica (spelling?) paired with a human. The gene has been past from generation to generation waiting to awakening in a worthy heir, one who is strong enough. Yusuke has become that heir.This is one of the best Yu Yu Hakusho volumes to date!A must see for all Yu Yu Hakusho fans."
2,Is this the same Bard???,"Sometimes it's hard to believe this story was written by Shakespeare. Perhaps it was a warm-up to his better works (Othello, Hamlet, etc.). The Bard didn't take the time to explain the motives of the African villain making him seem more like a cartoon or metaphor for evil than an actual person. As an African-American perhaps I was longing for some deeper explanation of Aaron's emotions, rather than simply placing a dark-skinned man as the villain for the convenience of ""dark=evil"" imagery. The gruesome images of rape and disfigurement also didn't appeal to me, as enamored as I am of happier topics.This play was written purely for entertainment, much like our contemporary horror films. There are nuggets of quotable poetry (mostly the expressive curses and lamentations). Sci-Fi fans will giggle in Act II.I when Demetrius addresses Chiron as ""youngling,"" but as a whole, this is not one of my favorite plays."
2,"Guts, Gore, Gross...","I will admit that I am definitely not a Sakespeare expert but read several plays in order to choose which enactment to see at the Stratford Festival. I didn't choose this one!This tradgedy was horrifying to read because of the sheer evilness of the characters and the outrageous violence throughout the story. There's deception, manipulation, rape, torture, gore and more gore. In my opinion, it isn't Shakespeare's most meaningful or enlightened work but it wasn't boring either. Hardly anyone escapes this story alive and the most redeeming quality, in my eyes, is that everyone in the end gets just what they deserve. This play must have shocked the audiences in the 1500's. If you're into violence and shock value this story won't disappoint."
3,Shakespeare's 1st Tragedy,"This is a good play, but it does not represent Shakespeare's best efforts. The genius that he displayed in the previously written ""Henry VI"" plays takes a back seat to blood and gore. While a certain amount of violence is required for a good drama, it seems graphic horror is here for the mere sake of graphic horror. Neither do the villains represent Shakespeare's best efforts. Aaron, Tamora, Chiron, or Demetrius are not chilling or captivating in their evil the way King Richard III is. Nor do they grab our attention with a crisis of conscience. (Claudius and Macbeth do) On the positive side, the play moves at a good pace. Lavinia is fine as the innocent martyr. Saturnius is memorable as the poor man caught in the middle. Titus, Lucius, and Marcus are fine as the heroes."
4,A good introductory book on painting in miniature.,"The book is an introduction to painting miniatures (portraits, landscapes, animals, still life scenes) in oils, watercolours and gouache. I found it very useful in discovering the techniques used and being able to follow examples given by a number of expert British miniaturists."
3,Traditional miniatures,"Very basic, really doesn't give much information on ""how to"", just very general things. Fine if you are a total beginner, but beyond that... It is fun to have tho if you are a miniature painter. There aren't many books out there and several are beyond most peoples means to own pricewise."
1,????,I would like to know more about this book. Miniatures is too general. Is it about Doll houses or Military /Fantasy lead Figures.?
2,Wrong connection,"I bought this because I misplaced the cable that came with my Startech external drive case. I have some old IDE drives I want to wipe and perhaps recycle for backups. The molex connection is male and I need female, my fault for not noticing. They get two stars for charging $8 shipping on a $3 part. Really, this could have been put in an envelope and sent USPS for 45 cents. I'll pay more attention to shipping in the future."
5,angels are back and back with style and action,its a very good dvd collection for all angellovers if you love the angels your sure to lovethis.So i hope you enjoy the first season the wayi did.
5,"YES! About time, but worth the wait.","OK! Finally!, but come on not enough extras, and why no Easter eggs, and why no interviews.Man this show does not get old, and is still to much fun and by God I enjoyed each and every show. Hope they release the soundtrack for the series.Nawaf"
2,Disapointed,"I must say after waiting a long time for this DVD Box set I was disapointed. Even though all episodes from the first season are here, It is not remastered. I own other DVD's from the same year that Charlie's Angels came out. My other DVDs were much better then this. Notice that the audio does not match the same as the characters talk. There seems to be a delay factor when it comes to the audio and characters talking. You can also tell that their are some scratches in the rpints. The cases that the DVDs come with are very cheap with no inserts.If you have to buy this box set and want to save some money buy it used. If money is not an issue then buy the original box set"
2,Charlie's Angels,the worst transfer of tv to dvd i have seen yet. ... Sony pictures should be ashamed that this box set has the Sony name on it.after you waste your money on this be sure and send Sony a thank you letter for the quality work they put into this series.The show is classic T.V but the dvd quality is the worst on the market. You would be better off with VHS if it were available
2,Not One Of My Favorites,"I gave this show two stars because that's all it had, Kate Jackson and Jacklyn Smith. Farrah only had to be herself, one dumb blond playing another dumb blond. She was never famous for her brains or her talent which she had neither. Lindsay Wagner was a far superior actress winning the Prime Time Emmy for best actress for that year. Even though Farrah later claimed that she won that Emmy. Which made her not only brainless but a liar as well. Farrah never won anything. She was nominated for her role in the Burning Bed but didn't win. Which I thought proved a lack of judgement on the part of the Prime Time Emmy Awards for even considering that she was good enough for a nomination. As you can probably guess from my review, it's safe to say I was never a fan of hers."
5,Great Show,Hadn't watched this show in years...loved it then and still love it now..so glad that I was able to find in on DVD after all these years
5,Charlies Angel restored and on DVD. Classic 70's entertainment from beginning to end,"Charlies Angels on DVD. Season one is the best season. With Farrah Fawcett on board they had the best chemistry of the angel pairing. Every Episode is restored with great picture and sound quality. It is all here every episode of season one including the pilot episode! This is true 70's entertainment. Is it cinematic genius definitely not, Is campy fun and have all the cliches you remember from the 70's definitely yes. IT is a 5 DVD set in nice digipak clamshell design at $15.00 per season is a great bargain. If loved the show in the 70's I would recommend you pick up this bargain priced set."
1,Audiovox CE506SLK,Piece of junk. CD door didn't close properly and after 1 to 2 hours of play the cd would start skipping. Returned the produce 2 weeks ago & still haven't received refund or any acknowledgement that the product was received. Will never by from seller again.
1,Sounds pretty good....until it stops working,I would have given it ZERO stars if that option was available.I didn't use it much. Maybe a dozen times or so.Then one day I tried turning it on and it wouldn't go on unless I used the remote. And the remote only worked to turn the system on...nothing else.The CD player wouldn't play at all. The CD would just spin. And none of the buttons on top worked when I pressed them.I called Audiovox and they wanted $50.00 to repair it. I threw it out!!!
4,"Despite the cheesy title and cliche' cover, it's a keeper","Sure, any compilation like this reeks of cash-in, and in the realm of ""punk rock"" that's a sin, but suspend your prejudices for a time and realize that the songs here are vital.Serving as an admirable time capsule for SoCal early eighties punk rock, this CD ties together a great lineup of important bands of that day and age. And not only are the bands first-rate, the songs chosen are actually the best those bands have to offer. Honestly, once you hear ""I Don't Care About You"" by Fear, that's about all the Fear you'll ever need to hear. Same goes for the Germs' ""Richie Dagger"" and Agent Orange's ""Bloodstains."" Sure, you could delve deeper into each artist, but if you didn't bother, you could still safely go to your grave not missing much.If you need a primer introduction to the roots of what they call American punk today (Offspring, Green Day, Blink182), this will serve that purpose admirably."
5,My girls love these movies,My daughters just started liking Wallace & Gromit. And you also get chicken run on top of that. Great buy at the right price.
1,Very disappointed.,"With a confirmation that my order was received and an estimate as to when I could expect to receive it, I waited and waited. When I waited in vain, I contacted the seller directly by the e-mail address given to me on Amazon.com. I never received a response from the seller. I was very disappointed that the seller, sapwcbtpm, did not let me know they were not going to fill my order, as the book was to be a gift for a special child."
1,Disappointed,"Having tried numerous treatments for keratosis pilaris without success, I was sceptical despite the many glowing positive reviews of this product on the net. It's been touted as some miracle treatment, and seemed too good to be true. But still I was hopeful that it'd be as good as it claims. I've used it for a month now and can hardly notice any difference at all in the texture or colouring of the skin on my arms. Disappointing considering how much it cost. I'll continue using what I've bought. Hopefully eventually it'll show some benefits.I think it'd be good if the product description included the amount of the active ingredients in the products. For example, what is the concentration of glycolic acid?Update: I've used two tubes now, and am sorry to say it hasn't worked for me."
1,Made things worse,"I have had issues more with the redness than actual bumps since puberty. But here recently, the bumps were becoming more prominent. So I thought I would try a product for the first time. For the first 3-4 days, my arms seem to feel and look better, then it all took a turn for the worse. The bumps became way more prominent and then started to spread to my lower arms and chest. The redness became worse as well. I immediately stopped using the product after about 2 weeks of usage and everything seemed to go back to normal. I might have just had a bad reaction but thought I would give some warning to those looking to spend this much money on a product."
2,"Okay, I guess","I've had red bumps on my arms all my life, and I've tried a handful of remedies for it. Mostly I just live with it and try not to be self-conscious about it. But, I decided to give this one a shot after purchasing a strapless wedding gown. Shortly after I started using it, a couple people commented that my arms looked better. But, I honestly can't tell any difference. After using it every day for 4 months, my supply has run out, and I don't think I'll purchase it again. I'll just get some make-up for my arms on my big day."
5,Imagine That movie,I am over 50 years old. I actually watched this movie alone. I look forward to watching it with my grandchildren. It is a very good movie.
4,movie watching,I enjoyed watching this. We watched it back to back. The little girl was cute and it is so often fathers have no clue on how to reach a child.
5,love love love it!!!,"I have a great love for this movie, its a movie that both kids and adults can enjoy. It has become a family favorite. I would suggest this movie to any father and daughter pair. My husband and daughter really bonded while watching it and it arrive so quickly from amazon. I love amazon!"
5,Very cute movie,I saw this movie with my husband and daughter. The movie was great but I only wish that Eddie Murphy showed more singing talent like he used too when he did the Party All the Time song back in 1985. But it was still a great movie
