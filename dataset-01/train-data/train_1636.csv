3,Music for organ and brass is really music mostly for brass.,"The brass playing is elegant in soft sections and has lots of fanfare in the loud sections. The choice and ordering of the pieces will keep the casual listener interested. The combination of dramatic fanfare stuff punctuated by quieter stuff seems about right for maximum listener appeal if you're not too snooty for this kind of program. Practically speaking, this is a brass recording since the organ lacks the muscle to keep up with the brass. In some of the pieces, the Empire Brass are joined by five additional players, and the organ gets completely clobbered. If you get this mainly for the brass and you don't mind the too small organ, and you are not one to turn your nose up at a recording designed to capture the interest of the common listener, then you will probably like this."
4,Michael Murray does it again!,"This is a very good piece of music. I think it is a little rushed when compared to E Power Biggs ""Music for Organ, Brass and Percussion"". I'm not sure if I like all of the style, but overall it is very listenable and rounded organ work."
1,Where's the Organ?,"What a big disappointment! How can so many exciting pieces of music be made to sound so dull? Someone should take a torch to Mr. Murray's organ bench; pehaps then there would be some fire to his performance. The Richard Strauss processional has been a longtime favorite of mine, but this lackluster pressing is beyong decent! Please, Columbia, re-release the E. Power Biggs recording of many of the same selections ruinrd on yhis CD!"
3,Reggie Bannister's Precious Devil,"What if the Scifi channel made one of their weekly monster movies with a hard ""R"" rating and then released it on DVD with extra footage in an unrated edition? You'd have Cemetery Gates. F-bombs, blood, boobs, and plenty of cheesy monster goodness."
5,Blast from the past for monster movie lovers!,"If you love old monster movies, and enjoy the type of films on MST3K, then you'll love this movie! Like a 1970's film, with plenty of blood, hairy monster and gratuitous boobs, it's a riot!"
4,A fine study of what stupidity is and how it spreads.,"Ever find yourself wondering how people can be so stupid, blind and self-destructive? Then this is the book for you. Though the jargon gets a little deep and wide sometimes, Welles takes a comprehensive look at where stupidity comes from and how it is transmitted individually and culturally. You might want to read it with a highlighter in hand."
1,He really knows his subject,"You have to admit - he really knows his subject.Here's the latest on him from the newswires.Sixty-one-year-old James Welles has been arrested ""for allegedly trying to arrange sex with a 15-year-old girl over the Internet. The girl turned out to be an undercover male detective."" Welles is the author of a pair of books, ""The Story of Stupidity"" and ""Understanding Stupidity."""
2,gives wrong impression,"The illustrations are beautiful and I love the idea of Baby Angels as I believe in Angels but I'm afraid this book could give the most definately wrong idea to a child being told that Angels will always keep them from harm which we all know is not true; it gives the idea that you can wonder off from home/family and the angels will keep you safe; totally the wrong idea to give children, they could think that it is alright to go off without anyone."
3,"The BOOK was good, COndition was Ok","My daugther loves this book, since we lost our new born sometime ago and I was looking for a book that shows baby angels. The pages were in very good condition with the exception of the first page where had a writting from the previous owner which it was a killer for me. Shipping time was just ok. I would buy again from this seller."
3,A bed-time treat for toddlers,"This lovely book, with its beautiful pastel drawings of little baby angels watching over a young child, is sure to be a bedtime favorite for little ones. Enchanting ryhmes, paired with sweet, sweet pictures make this a real bed-time treat for toddlers.DeeDee Fox, Author and Illustrator, The Ruby Red Slippers"
3,Very Derivative of Todd Rundgren,"Sounds like these folks took the ""soft"" side of Todd Rundgren from Something Anything and made a whole album of derivative examples of that sound. That's certainly a sonic accomplishment, though if I want to hear so much soft Todd I'd just put on Something Anything and skip the harder rocking tracks."
1,self published....,"This book is self published and it shows. The writing is choppy, the plot is disconnected and Mr. Keane's punctuation and grammar need serious work. Dialogue is not even comic book worthy."
1,Unbelievable ...,"...this is one of the three worst books for sale on Amazon. The other two are also in this series.The book is poorly written. The plot is woeful. The dialogue seems to be written by children...Please, please, please do not waste your money buying this book or your time reading it."
2,"Too Short, Too General","The article is a very light overview without the detail necessary to be useful to a patient. Bottom line: Exercise is good for chronic conditions. You will need other resources, a physical therapist or a trainer to figure out what those exercises should be."
1,Not that great - Wilton Press Set,"Since I'm not so great at spacing lettering, I thought this might be the perfect solution. However, the letters slide freely while in the holder and often just fall out completely. Additionally, the spacing between letters varies depending upon which letter is chosen. And another thing, the size of the letters is only appropriate for a smaller (9-12"") cake; they would look ridiculously small on anything larger. Also note that the letters are only capitals, no lowercase. Lastly, there weren't enough repeat letters for me to complete even one line of text (not enough ""R""s), so I had to press each word separately, causing some spacing/alignment issues.That's my two cents. Hopefully you won't pay more for this Wilton Press Set than that."
2,Was suppose to be new!,"When I got this product I was disappointed. When I ordered it ,the info on it said it was new. However when I received it, the box was ripped and mangled and it wasn't from the shipping. Also, the letters were not in their plastic wrapping and had been taken apart and I'm not sure that all of the letters came with the product."
3,"Decent, but too small","Exactly as the title says, they're alright, but too narrow, and too small, to really be of much use. I don't think I've seen but one or two cakes that have used lettering this small, and if you are looking for an easy guide, you won't find one here. The letter impressions are VERY narrow."
3,"""You Are A Mess""","Some interesting and at times beautiful camera work, a Rachmaninoff soundtrack, an attractive young man (Pierre Chatagny), a lot of skin and steamy sex cannot save this movie by French director Lionel Baier who also has a part in it as an ""older man."" Chatagny plays Loic, a young man who meets other men on the internet, but supposedly is unhappy. He wants to be a great photographer but practices his camera art with a cell phone camera. Okay. At one point in this very long 90 minute production, Loic's friend Marie says that he is a mess-- a perfect description of this self-indulgent first film (?) by Baier.Apparently-- if we are to believe the extra footage included on the DVD version-- ""Garcon Stupide"" was a big hit at a film festival in Montreal. Perhaps what Mr. Baier is trying to say gets lost in translation. There seems to be no end to these lackluster French movies about boy meeting boy with lots of scenes shot in the dark and enough angst to go around."
3,Garcon review,"The production seemed to be very good; however, without any english translation or subtitles, a person not speaking the language cannot follow the action."
4,Loved it!,"I really enjoy most gay-themed independent films, and this is up there with the best. Although I tend to like more fun, sexy, light-hearted romances (Trick, Beverly Kills, All Over the Guy, Dorian Blues, etc...), the dramas from Picture This are always very beautiful and thoughtful. Garcon Stupide is no exception."
1,"Junk, Junk, Junk",This is pure junk! The pontoon broke after 1 use. The screws pulled out of the frame and it was totally useless. It ended up in the trash can where it belonged.
5,Best single source for contemporary composers,"This is an encyclopedia of Contemporary Composers which politically correctly covers a lot of unbias international composers. (For instances, composers from Taiwan.) It also includes young talented composers. Every composers has good (1) biographical information (2) list of compositions and (3) an article about the composer. If this is only one book that I can get in this subject, I will choose this book, but not this first edition. The second edition was published by a different publisher. If you want to buy this book, you should go for the second edition."
2,Good while they last but it has a short life span,"We purchased our first Haier 1700 at Brandsmart for $137.00 three years ago along with an extended warranty. After one year we turned it in for a replacement because the temp. was unstable. The second one lasted two years before the door broke, and the convection fan stopped. I love the price and the size. It accomodates a 1/2 size baking pan. It's great for about a year or two at most."
1,This Oven is TRASH,I bought a Haier convection oven and it broke after only a few months. I called their customer service department and they said they would send me a new one. I have waited 2 months and made 17 phone calls and still nothing. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMPANY. Their products are cheap chinese junk and they DO NOT stand behind their products. Don't believe me? Look around on the web and you will see plenty of other people complaining about their cheap products and ZERO customer support.
2,Need a drip pan to set under entire oven,"I bought this oven recently. It is cheaply made but most of the functions do a fair job. All except the rotisserie; when used, grease runs from the unit onto the countertop even though the unit is level and the drip tray is not full. I was very dissapointed. I contacted them via email today, they say they will get with me in 24 hrs. We'll see."
1,not good for the money,"Haier RTC1700 Extra Large Capacity Convection Oven would be great if the company did a better job puting it together. The first one worked for 1.5 weeks then the power went out on it. Sent for a new one and it came with the door not put together right. Part of the hinge was missing. Not happy with this at all. Will not deal with this company again. I bought this as a gift for my mother and she is the one who has had to deal with this mess. Elizbeth, NV."
3,Not disappointed for the money,"After readng the prevois reviews on this convection oven I was a sceptic. But I did not want to spent $300 for a comeercial grade countertop convection oven. For those prices you can almost get a whole stove if needed. There is some truth to the previous reviews when comes to the accurancy of the temperture. At least 25-35 degree off. However, keep in mind this is an xtra large convection oven being powered by standard 120 volts. If this oven ran on the 220 volts that the standard kitchen oven runs on then there would be better performance. Plug it directly into wall outlet, do not use an extension cord if possible. Extension cords will effect the performance. The convection feature works well. Overall for the reasons stated above I am ok with my purchase."
2,Works well-could be built better,This cooks good but the metal cabinet is too thin.The appliance gets extremely hot to the touch and can cause serios burns to kids or pets.Must stay w/and supervise the whole time!!
4,LOVE THIS OVEN!!,"We just finished our first five-pound chicken using the rotisserie. I have now owned this oven for two days and am very impressed with even my first try using it. I shopped in stores and then finally came to Amazon to do comparisons and saw this Chinese-made oven. My first thoughts were I hate to buy Chinese since everything seems to be made by the Chinese these days, but after reading the Wikipedia writings about this company (Haier), I decided to take a chance in spite of some of the negative reviews. I had decided just before I saw the Haier oven I was prepared to pay $249.00 for the Breville BOV800XL oven. Since this Chinese oven was only $119.00 with free shipping and nearly the same specs, it was a no-brainer. We are hoping our first impression continues into the months or years, knowing nothing lasts forever. So for now we are very happy with this nice-looking, excellent functioning oven."
5,Best Metal Not Forgotten,I bought my first Purple album which was MACHINE HEAD back in 72 at the age of 9. That was my first Purple experience. I instantly fell in love an began searching out other albums.When I came across In Rock I thought how was Machine Head their biggest seller. This was not only their best recording ever but nobody has ever produced vocals on a hard rock album like Ian Gillan did on this one. He is truley one of the best vocalist in all of music. Just listen to Child In Time an I say no more point proven.Now having this disc totally remastered is something to enjoy. Like the writing on the back of the Purple Mark III album Made IN Europe. Savor these tracks at maximum volume for now is the chance to finally come taste the band.
3,"I refer to vinyl format, five star for music itself...but...","As much as I enjoy the fact of having this LP in my collection, it is a very rare situation when a record sounds worse than a CD. I have the anniversary UK edition and it sounds great so I expected the LP to sound even better, but instead the sound is flat, the songs are different in volume and it somehow doesn't rock. I remember how great the original LP was, even though the recording itself was not ahead of it's time. This is also an American version with introduction on Speed King cut off completely, and while I can understand some critics towards the guitar madness, cutting off the brilliant organ intro doesn't make any sense to me. So if you expect the greater sound out of this, pass it for the AE cd or try to get the original press on ebay. If you have both like me, it is still great to have it in your collection."
2,Poor sound quality,"Unfortunately I was disappointed with the sound quality of this vinyl re-issue by Friday Music. The sound has no vinyl clarity, warmth and depth. The same I can tell about Friday Music re-issue of Deep Purple ""Burn"" album on vinyl that was released this year. They both sound no better than the CDs."
5,A+++++IN ROCK IN THE TRUEST SENSE OF THE WORD!,A SHINING HOUR FOR THIS MEGA U.K. BAND. RITCHIE BLACKMORE CONTINUALLY SHINES WITH HIS AMAZING FRETWORK! BRILLIANT TRACKS LIKE SPEED KING MAKE THIS A HOME RUN CLASSIC....ORIGINAL ALBUM COVER....
2,"It's okey, but no masterpiece!","I don't agree with all these people who claim that ""In rock"" is a masterpiece. Of course it's an album that helped developing rock music, but that is more because of the sound, or approach itself, than the actual quality in the songs. ""Speed king"" and ""Bloodsucker"" are good songs and so is parts of (the much too long) ""Child in time"", where Ian Gillan show us all what a beautiful and powerful voice he have. I'd spend my money on ""Machine head"" and ""Fireball"" before even considering buying this one.Maybe 2 stars is a bit too little, and 2.5 stars would be more correct."
3,good album,"This is a good album for those enjoy deep purple. Tracks like speed king, and child in time worth the album."
3,quite good,they weren't led zeppelin but still quite good. they had good lyrics but the melodies were terrible! child in time is a great song!
1,Tie them up atop Mt Rushmore and never let them return!,"The first time I listened to this thang (when I was a tender teen rocker) I though it was a joke.But then, many of my hard rock loving friends were so gung ho about it, I thought ""I must be wrong"".Now that I'm an old fart (and proud of it!), I listened to the thang again and boy, was I right!Ian Gillan's performance in Speed King really deserves a place in Rock History. Specifically under the chapter ""Laughable Yelling Clowns""."
1,Are you Deep Purple fans drunk???,"This album is horrible, I mean absolutely horrible. It realizes the very worst possibilities of 70s rock. Screeching unintelligle vocals without inflection; uninspired amateurish ax-work that seriously makes you wonder if Richie Blackmore isn't drunk in the studio; and songs that somehow manage to be devoid of rhythm and melody at the same time. Richie Blackmon shows no creativity and less talent on guitar- Jimmy Page's roadies were better guitarists."
4,A good album,"This album is much better than Led Zeppelin 1,..monster hard rock!!! Child in time, Black night, speed king, Into the fire are still the best memory song of all time... Blud sucker is cool and Ian Gillan is still the ultimate voice of DP,..long live DP"
5,"The definitive ""Hard Rock"" offering...","To this day there has never been another album that has come close to setting the standard for Hard Rock music...Whats cool about this record is at that time there were no other bands to copy..At least none of the style of music that was laid down on this one...It was, and is, totally original...As a practicing musician of 30 years I can say that this is one to buy...""Speed King"" and ""Child in Time"" alone are worth the price of this CD...Lyrically this was kind of nasty for the time, which made it that much better...The guitar riff on ""Hard Lovin Man"" had naver been played (or recorded,to my knowledge) to that time,so I beleive ""Ritchie"" to be the ""Master"" of what we hear today...""Livin Wreck"" is kind of goofy,but look at bands like ""The Offspring"" or ""Ugly Kid Joe""...Thats pretty goofy...(I like these bands,by the way)...ROCK ON !!!"
5,Excellent,Classic album by the legendary band. Great record with a heavy vinyl and sleeve. Much better than the regular old repressings
5,MILESTONE IN ROCK!,"This is a must have album (CD) for any Deep Purple, rockn'roll, or guitar fan. Even after all these years it hardly sounds dated. The musicianship and composition are second to none. This was one of those albums that made people sit up an notice this band...and of course Machine Head came along..and the rest is history. You can hear the influence this album had on other musicians/bands at the time and those that came after. If you are dissapointed with this CD I suggest you may be a country music fan..not that there's anything wrong with that!"
5,FAST THE VANISHING POINT ON THE HORISON,"FAST, FASTER FASTEST THERE WERE ALL KINDS OF SPEED, BACK THENAND IN ROCK MAYBE EVEN WAY BACK THEN IN 1970 AS FAST AS THEY PLAYED IN A BLUR BACK THEN THEY KNEW THEY WOULD BE THE FOREFATHERS OF SPEED METAL AMEN!"
3,"Great Album, Only ""Fair"" Sound...","""In Rock"" is arguably one of the first true ""heavy metal"" albums. It still stands as one of Deep Purple's best & ""heaviest"" works. The sound on this cd version, however, leaves much to be desired. I will swear my old lp sounds better. So 5 stars for the music, 1 star for the sound. Your best option is to spend a few extra bucks on the Import ""25th Anniversary"" edition. Unlike many ""limited editions"" & ""remasters"" the bonus tracks on the ""In Rock 25th Anniversary"" kick @ss thanks to some remixing by Roger Glover.Again, pass on this one in favor of the better sounding and expanded Import version."
4,One of a Kind ...,"Certainly, one of the best Deep Purple CDs ever. I never get tired of listening to Speed King - plus, this disc contains the original version of Child in Time - what a great ( really great ) song !! Everyone in the band played superb on this recording. Too bad it wasn't a double album. Hard to believe it came out in 1970 - it could have been yesterday. I would have rated it 5 stars if the disc had more minutes of music on it."
2,3 great ideas unexplored,"The author has some great ideas and is a decent writer, but takes several liberties that make the story difficult to follow. The book begins with a scientist finding a zombie dog. Then the two do an abundance of scientific experiments on the dog, only to suddenly assume (with no proof) that special people can raise the dead. They then set out to find them. Then, with little warning we're years later and there's been a tremendous change to our society. We have no idea how it happened; all we know is that it did. Then towards the end, just as suddenly, it changes again. It's almost as if he put three different stories ideas together without doing the work to make them flow together. The book left me unsatisfied and confused (and missing my $15).If I could suggest something to the author, it would be to work another couple of years on this book and make it the great novel it should've been."
4,To Wake the Dead,"Steve Woeste's To Wake the Dead will keep you wanting to know what comes next. Actually just when you think you know what will come next, it doesn't, and a new spool unwinds. It's quite imaginative and suspensfull. Although I am not much into sci fi, this book is different - it will have a much wider audience. It's well written and a quick read. I highly recommend the book."
5,A very good read,"I highly recommend this book. The author writes crisply and eloquently and tells a captivating story. As summer approaches, this is a very enjoyable read for the beach or any other vacation. The chapters move quickly and the action never gets bogged down. In other words, it's a real page turner."
3,58 Championship,"It's hard to review a video on your team loosing the championship but, I enjoyed watching the 58 Championship Game anyways. The positive thing was that the Giants came back to take a lead 17 to 14 lead in the 4rth quarter over comming Frank Giffords 3 Fumbles. The other fact I didn't know was that Baltimore was spying on the Giants practices and learned that the Giants were going to use the same 4-3 Defence that was used to beat Cleveland twice. Unitas to Berry seem to be unstopable during the game. After my 2nd attempt of ordering this tape I still think it was worth waiting for. You will enjoy the commentaries from both teams on this game."
2,Disappointing,"It has been a few years since I was unfortunate enough to find this novel on the shelf of a used bookstore. My recollection is clear on that it was dull and did not have any real ""action"" aside from a few pages, which was itself disappointing. The story involves a former President working on his memoirs of his time in office. It absolutely didn't work for me, I am sorry to say. I see that Barry Malzberg has been up for a Nebula Award as recently as 2009, so I am confident his other works are much better than this."
3,Eggwave,Scrambled eggs will blow up all over the microwave or ooze out of the vent. Hard boiled is still uncooked underneath. Eggs didn't look to tasty. Fed them to my dog !
2,Egg Wave Review,"Cooked hard yolk eggs ok... scrambled eggs with this is a joke. Most of the time the eggs come out runny, and they are always in the shape of their container. Cannot compare to frying and doesnt really save time because you have to clean the pieces after you use it."
5,it works well,"I bought the product five or six years ago from a late-night TV offer. It was inexpensive and did exactly what I hoped it would--cooked eggs in a microwave. I'm not an egg chef and don't care about fancy egg dishes, just wanted to cook the eggs quickly, with little mess and no fat. What could go wrong? Nothing goes wrong. You just adjust the seconds in the microwave according to how you like the eggs; if you don't screw the top on tight it may pop off in the oven, but after that, it's foolproof.Over the years the pieces are all lost--each cooker needs a bottom and a lid--so I now want to replace them, and first choice would be to get another of these things. I am sorry to see that this item is currently marked ""unavailable."""
3,Poached Eggs Too Small,"This product works fine for most style of eggs, but I did not like the poached eggs coming out with small diameters and high thickness. I want a poached egg that better fits the muffin to create my favorite breakfast - a poached egg, bacon and cheese sandwich."
1,Does not hard boil whole eggs,"Disappointed. The description said you could boil whole eggs for deviled eggs, etc. Turns out you have to break the egg into the container and shake it up. It works fine if you want quick scrambled eggs, but that is about it.I do not recommend this if you are looking for a microwave cooker for whole boiled eggs."
3,Prince Jammy Works It.,The reknowned dubmaster Prince Jammy adds synth bass and electronic drums to Black Uhuru's debut work.I Love King Selassie's treatment scored big but it didn't add much to the other tracks already tight with Sly and Robbie on drum and bass.
5,An Excellent Buy!,"This is a strong, sturdy stepping stool such as the type used in a doctor's office. It is perfect for the tall beds in my guest bedroom. Whether my guest is a small child or an arthritic elder, this stepping stool is perfect for the job. It can also be used to reach a ceiling fan lightbulb easily or the highest shelf in the kitchen cabinet or hallway closet. This is a handy household item that stores easily in a closet, pantry, or garage. Recommended."
4,An Overlooked Gem,"McQueen's portrayal of a hotshot B-17 pilot is brilliant. This is a guy who loves the war because in it, he's somebody. Without the war he is a nobody-- a misfit without a purpose. The character development of Rickson is superb; his cruel streak gradually becomes visible to his crew and his drive to ""win"" overrides his loyalty to his co-pilot.The look and feel of this film reeks of authenticity-- how many other war movies show a planes machine guns being test-fired on the way to a bombing mission. At the end, the B-17 is almost impossible to control and you can almost feel the plane bucking and vibrating as it gradually disintegrates. This story could not have ended any other way."
4,Vintage Steve McQueen.,"This movie is a very good WWII movie about the B-17 strategic bombers and the stresses of their missions. Steve McQueen performs as a pilot in a role similar to his infantry role in Hell is for Heroes--the iconoclast maverick who dies in the end. 12 O'Clock High is probably still the high water mark movie of this type, but The War Lover is a welcome addition to my WWII collection. In company with Patton, Guns of Navarone, The Longest Day, Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan, and Downfall, The War Lover gives insight into the utter waste of people and resources that occured during WWII..."
3,Average,"I remember viewing this movie on television, years past. It must have diminished via time. It surely didn't have the ""punch"" that it used to. It was okay, but not fascinating."
3,War Lover,Steve McQween stars as a obsessed bomber pilot in WWII England. A fairly powerful drama with some good aerial drama
3,WW !! movie,If you like WW11 movie's and Steve McQueen this is a good movie.Compares with 12 oClock High. Early McQueen movie and a good startfor him.
5,The War Lover,This movie came to me in very good condition.I watched this movie when it first came out.Steve McQueen has always been one of my favorite actors.He played a great part in this movie.If you like war movies this is a good one .
3,Apron,"With so little choice in Houston Texan gifts this was not quite as showy as I would have liked but then the price was most agreeable. The Dallas Cowboys ties were oh, so smart!"
1,No good,"It changes all the sounds of the songs! They don't sound the same, and the people singing them can't keep the right beat!I don't know what others will think but I don't like it."
5,Every True Crime MUST have this book,Anyone who has ever had an interest in crime this is the book for you. It is written (and written well) by the two foremost respected criminologists in the UK. It covers everything from the early years of crime detection including Jack the Ripper up until modern day times - with ALOT in between. This book should be on every true crime buff's shelf. An amazing reference book and interesting read.
2,"This is NOT a ""Reuseable design - changeable filters and cartridges.""","This respirator is not ""Reuseable design - changeable filters and cartridges."" The filter cartridges are fixed, NOT replaceable as described in the description... Also is only a half face mask and DOES NOT ""Affords eye... protection."""
3,good size but break easily,"these are a nice (small but not too small) size, but they break very easily. have already lost a few."
4,A Live Album that captures a moment in time.,"If you enjoyed their music BITD, you will find much to love here!I like to workout to this music as the tempo is right for high intensity spinning."
1,"Utterly sad,worthless piece of trollop.","Not worth the dignity to be categorised in my 100 worst movies of all time list,I instead just decided to stuff this meaningless trollop back where it came from.Unbelievably terrible."
1,For the casual Phillie fan,Book offers little in terms of new information. Much of research could have been accomplished without an interview. Profiles seem to have been chosen randomly. This is a read for those who have a passing interest in Philadelphia baseball.
1,Died after 18 months,My LaCie 20gig Pocket drive died after 18 months. I used it once per month for backup of my desktop system and laptop. Now it's green light comes on but it doesn't spin up and the USB connection will not be recognized by either system.
5,Taught my two year old the sounds of the letters!,"This is such a fun CD. I borrowed it from my local library to listen to in the car while we drive, and both of my boys love it! My boys are ages 2 and, the other just turned 4. The four year old knew his ABC's but didn't know all of the sounds, and the catchy songs have taught him all of them. My two year old also has learned all of the sounds of the letters of the alphabet as well.The songs are super creative, and fun to listen to, even for me the parent. I highly recommend this CD to those looking for fun music for their toddler's or preschoolers!"
3,Average For St. Germain,"St. Germain usually puts out fairly solid compilations and/or personal albums with his own tracks. Boulevard contains tracks that all produced by St. Germain, but did not live up to my expectations. Three tracks are over ten minutes each. ""Deep In It"" and ""Soul Salsa Soul"" are great, but the remaining tracks are nothing special.3.5/5 stars."
5,Great music!,"Sam Neely's Son of the South is just great music. I like every song on the CD. It is like listening to old and new country at the same time. It is different and yet very familiar. Neely has his own style,,,,,,and I like it."
4,Stress Free Calm Formula,I purchased this product through Amazon.com because I knew it would be available at this web site as it always is.
4,"A great idea, but incomplete","Erich Kunzel plays the Bond themes? What a great idea! In addition, there are a few more selections in the same vein, like the cops-n-robbers TV medley, music from The Untouchables, Lethal Weapon, Beverly Hills Cop, etc.Sometimes, you want to listen to the 007 music in instrumental only, and Kunzel and the Cincinatti Pops do a good job with the arrangements. But where are the rest of the songs? Missing are three of my all-time favorites, You Only Live Twice, Diamonds Are Forever, and Moonraker. I think the album would be better with 'more Bond, less other.' We certainly don't need TWO selections from Dick Tracy. And the theme from Darkman is stylistically quite similar to Dick Tracy; nothing is gained by playing both. Don't get me wrong; I like Danny Elfman (check out his ""Beetlejuice"" theme on Kunzel's 'Great Fantasy Adventure Album'). I just wanted to hear all my fave Bond pieces on the one CD.Still, it's a keeper."
3,Great stuff but not the best Kunzel,"Lots of hit or miss tracks here. Love how he went with the Barry orchestral version of the Bond theme instead of the Bella Fleck guitar solo which is ALWAYS emulated on compilations in some form or another. Can't stand Lethal Weapon because it sounds like nothing that was in the film. I'm not even sure where that theme came from but it wasn't from Kamen's score? Maybe some random song from the album back in the day? ew.Morricone's Untouchables is a masterpiece and he does great justice to it. It's so good I prefer this version to the original recording. Could to without the TV themes because I don't watch TV. Live and Let Die is also a surprise, as it actually sounds like the George Martin score instead of a band version of the McCartney tune (a route that they could have easily taken). For the most part it's a classy presentation."
1,Broke as soon as I plugged in the cable,"Not sure if I just had a dud but the second after I plugged in the source cable, the white insert popped out with a busted solder weld. Serious quality issue. Hopefully the seller will refund what I paid."
5,3 way cable splitter,Great splitter for a low price... It also lowers the DB by about 5 units so it's not drastic and does not lower the cable or Internet quality of my service provider.
4,Works Great,I'm using this to split the signal from one Dish Network receiver to any TV in my upstairs bedrooms. Works just fine with no degradation in signal.
2,earring,Stones are nice but the posts had rough spots that I had to clean off to keep from snagging in my ears. Once removed it appears that the silver is only a coating.
4,You Get what you See,"Its a very nice, white, plastic cake stand that revolves. That's basically what it is, there's no magic to it or no tilting but I knew that when I bought it so its still served its purpose. The only thing is- you can serve things on it but its not the prettiest cake stand for the dining room table. But other than that, I ice my cakes just fine."
4,interesting,Easy to read and good explanations/examples. Well laid out in chapters. Similar topics grouped together. A very satisfying revision aid
5,good equipment,"good equipment does what i need for it to do, very well made and stable for doing dips and anything else."
1,BUYER BEWARE THIS ITEM IS TOTAL JUNK,"THE BIGGEST PILE OF STEAMING DOG CRAP I HAVE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF SMELLING, I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER SINGLE THING WITH THE NAME BODY SOLID ON IT AGAIN. I SHOULD DRIVE TO THE CORPORATE OFFICE AND PERSONALLY SPIT IN THE CEO'S FACE. THE OTHER REVIEWS LISTED HERE MUST HAVE BEEN WRITTEN BY THE SALES TEAM. THIS WOULD BE A GREAT PRESENT FOR SOMEONE YOU HATE.."
1,Do Not Purchase Haier Products,"I purchased 2 units in November. One unit broke within thirty days. Since then, I have been sent 4 units through the Haier Company which have all been defective. Their customer service did not meet my expectations, and I am now shopping for another brand of microwave to purchase."
2,Not worth the money,"Bought it for my son in August 2006. Was used only every other day and it burned itself out in January 2007. Terrible, terrible product. Buyer beware!!"
1,IT SUCKS,The Haier Microwave I got from you is now at the Goodwill Store here in Battle Creek. The only thing that worked was the CLOCK.You people should be ashamed of yourselfs
1,Wothrless,Product arrived DOA. went thru warranty exchange with Haier. Still have not received replacement.Never again.
4,good product,"works good, only thing found so far in over 2 months of owning, is that the popcorn setting is not long enough, have not had any problems with overall of this microwave"
5,NEED MORE STARS TO RATE THIS MOVIE!,"The mystery and suspense of The Thin Man make it interesting, but they are not the best part. The genius of this movie is pairing of William Powell and Myrna Loy. They portray Nick and Nora with great wit (sometimes just plain hilarity), class, and uncommon sophistication (for their era). Also, throw in a little romance and a happy marriage. What does this mean? The perfect movie! I own the entire Thin Man collection, and highly recommend them to anyone who enjoys classics."
2,Encourages alcoholism.,"William Powell and Myrna Loy, the actors playing the husband and wife, are likeable with some playful banter.However, William Powell plays a detective who is an alcoholic, stumbling around, always with a drink in hand, but miraculously sobers up at key moments. I did not like the film's promotion of alcoholism.The respected businessman has a mistress, and his mistress is sleeping around with a couple of other guys. I did not like this theme either.The businessman regularly goes out of town, and does not tell anyone where he is going or for how long. Thus, the script-writer too conveniently sets this guy up for easy murder.The idea of husband and wife detectives is a good one, and the actors were likeable, but I was disappointed in the script, and have thrown this DVD away."
5,These two are pure magic together!,"watching William Powell and Mryna Loy together is such a joy, they seem to be made for each other. they share a joke and let you in on it. You must watch all of the thin man movies, they are pure magic."
4,Old fashioned but fun.,"There's a whole lot of drinking going on (gee, perhaps prohibition earlier in the decade influenced this movie script? :-) but the mystery stands the test of time and the actors are entertaining."
5,Great Classic,"My first introduction with this movie was with my Mom. I was just a young teen and fell under the Nick and Nora spell. I used to look forward to the re-airing and would watch it whenever possible. I was fortunate to find this available on Amazon Prime, rent and watch this with one of my young adult children, who has never seen this. He fell instantly in love and now wants to watch the series of movies that followed. Side note, if you've never seen, be on the look out for Aster ( the dog). Scene stealer."
4,Delightful screwball comedy,"Extremely popular in its day and the beginning of a whole series, this picture is mainly about the married couple Nick and Nora Charles (William Powell and Myrna Loy) who booze and joke their way through life (Nick does some private eye work, too, but seems more content to live off Nora's inheritance). The mystery here is fairly complicated and full of incident, but it doesn't matter really - it's for the antics of the Charleses that we watch. A lot of people in ""conventional"" marriages in the 30's must have been swept off their feet into a near fantasy world of romance and possibility when they first saw Nick and Nora; that's less likely to happen today. Worth a watch."
4,Schism,"This film details the story of a man who is struggling with the effects of Alzheimer's disease. Neil, the main character of this story, is hospitalized after breaking his hip. He heals, but is not allowed to leave the hospital. He makes a number of friends, but begins thinking that there is a conspiracy against him. This is not true as it is a product of his Alzheimer's disease, yet it is disturbing for him nonetheless. He begins to lose his memory and hear voices that are not really there. This film gives us a view of Alzheimer's through the eyes of someone who is actually experiencing it. The construction of the movie is successful in allowing us to feel like we are going through this struggle with Neil. It is a truly eye-opening film that everyone should see in order to understand the workings of the brain. Extremely interesting!"
3,Rainbow Green Live-Food Cuisine,Lots of great information and recipes! Wouldn't want to be without it!
4,A great way to enjoy more raw food,"I barrowed this book from a friend who had brought a fabulous uncooked pepper marinara sauce to a dinner party.I tried a few more recepies and they were all so excellent that I knew I should own this book too.I do try to eat alot of raw food but am not bound to eating soley raw,so I enjoy mixing some of the soups and sauces with steamed food and it works out great.The chefs who developed this recipe book are truely some of the best!It's a great addition to any cooks collection of cook books.I love it!"
5,Amazing information!,I have been researching a raw food diet for the past couple of years and Rainbow Green Live Food Cuisine is by far one of the most amazing and scientific based raw living books I have read yet. So clear and concise...I would highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in achieving optimal health!
3,recipes are not balanced,"I've only tried one of his cracker recipes....it was so gross I threw out the whole thing. If I had read more carefully the ingredients, I would have noticed that 1Tablespoon of salt was an extreme amount for a batch of crackers. Then I went through his other recipes, they seem to be grossly imbalanced also (but to be fair I haven't tried them). To me that says a lot about the philosophy as well (extreme, imbalanced). I still believe your God-given sense of taste is the best way to judge if a food is good for you or not. I for one can actually taste the difference between an organic and non organic apple. I think raw food that tastes bad...is still not good for you. for those who are comtemplating the raw lifestyle, don't be discouraged if you haven't found any recipes you truly like, there are some really REALLY great ones out there, I just don't think you are likely to find them in this book."
4,Great Recipes and Advice on Living Foods,"This book really turned me on to the importance of low-glycemic foods in a raw food lifestyle. Since I bought the book, I have definitely switched to a higher protein diet, and I can see the benefits. The recipes are great, but careful not to overdo the dehydrated stuff...it's not as alive as fresh stuff."
5,You too can eat healthy. Stop eating poison...,"Processed foods and sugars are poison. Eat better and live longer. Read this book and add at least 10 years to your life. It's scary how much better I feel after eating like this for 8 weeks. If you are reading this and care about your health then check it out,... out of your local library. I bought this book b/c it ROCKs. Live, Love, Be.... BeLive."
5,The Way to Ultimate Health,"Awesome! Gabriel Cousens has done it again! Brought to readers the latest updates to the most fantastic health program on the planet. I'm a degreed nutritionist and have personally spent over a week at the Tree of Life Rejuvenation Center--fabulous! The food is the absolute greatest! This book shows you how to heal yourself and maintain optimal health. Bravo, Gabriel!"
3,Digital Sound with a so-so collection,"This is another of the Telarc label's collections put together under the conductor Erich Kunzel and performed by the Cincinnati pops orchestra. Like all Telarc discs, the sound is pure digital and hence can really pack a punch. Moreover, Kunzel often chooses some vey nice gems in his collections -- e.g. the neglected Last Starfighter piece here. However, the problem arises in the fact that many pieces of film score don't play well with a large orchestra -- they loose their focused intensity. The Batman here suffers from such a flaw and is weaker than the original score. The Pops orchestra is best with march-type themes, of which there are not enough on this album to make it outshine the original soundtracks from which it draws."
5,Writers wrock! Or do rockers rite?,"I really, really love this record. I cannot tell you how happy it makes me to listen to Leonard Maltin singing ""Act Naturally"". Or Molly Ivins trilling away on ""It Wasn't God Who Made Honky Tonk Angels"". Amy Tan kicks butt when she snarls out ""These Boots Are Made For Walkin'"". But more than anything else, I love Robert Reich singing ""Chain Gang"". How often do you get to hear a pop song with the line ""My woman, whom I love so well""? I gave a copy to my bookworm parents - you know, the people it's impossible to find presents for - they loved it. Anyone who likes reading and authors will enjoy this record. My only regret is that the producers started too late. If only I could have a record of Ernest Hemingway doing ""The Battle of the Green Berets"". Or maybe Herman Melville singing ""Splish Splash"""
1,"If I had a sense of rhythm, I would be fabulous.","This CD features writers singing classic rock and roll, country, R&B, blues and pop songs; along with a few original songs. The writers are people like Stephen King, Amy Tan, Norman Mailer, Dave Berry and Maya Angelou. Most of them are pretty bad singers, although a few of them can sing a little. At least they managed to get professional musicians to back them up, so it doesn't sound completely awful. Almost, but not completely. But it was done for charity, so I won't pick on them too much."
4,Written with a Heavy Post-Tribulation View,"This book is well-written but presents the Post-Tribulation viewpoint of the end-times. The hope of God is lacking ultimately in Jay Zinn's message. Post-Tribulation thinking is marred by legalism and fear. Otherwise, this is a good book."
3,Good read if you don't expect much.,"For fans of Christian fiction, particularly those who loved books like, This Present Darkness, or Left Behind, you will be drawn to the familiar theme of Christian lives caught in the turmoil of the Tribulation. Consistent with Scripture, you have the dramatic raise of the Anti-Christ and the persecution of Christians struggling to remain true to their faith. Unfortunately, the author fails to develop the characters, or their relationships with one another. As a result, you are left with no more than another interpretation of biblical end-times. The pace is jolting, the characters two-dimensional, and little of the biblical interpretation is unique to the author. In order words, Tribulation Lite."
4,Does this mean Disney's rereleasing the movie?,I love the Black Cauldron. Read Lloyd Alexander's Black Cauldron Books! Gurgi is the best character. I hope that the fact that this was published in 1994 means that Disney is going to rerelease the movie. I thought they'd deny its existance forever.
3,"Eh, It's Okay","For those that purchase soundtrack collages to have a variety of songs and themes, then this is good for you. Unfortunately, these tracks didn't have the signature Erich Kunzel version of the songs as he had on other soundtrack mix CDs. It was more like just that, a mix CD of different soundtracks and scores. However, it was a good buy in the fact that the tracks chosen had excellent sound quality and a sense of harmony."
3,So-so collection.,"Just when you are beginning to enjoy a track, it ends. Longer selections would have made this collection more satisfying. Overall choice of film scores was entertaining."
2,A lesser Dostoevsky.,"When you have traversed the expanse of Dosteovsky's power and intellect, such things as 'the burn' simply roll off your shoulders like shouts from the rabble. Aksyonov speaks from too haughty a perch for my taste, as I've never been able to personally relate any experiences in this novel with those of my own personal life; which, in my own literary assessment, should be the goal of almost any enjoyable literature. But perhaps I'll give The Burn another chance, but for now (after traversing through Gravity's Rainbow, Death on the Installment Plan, etc...) I may have become rather irritated with such a sloppy telling of a story, which, after all, should be the base point of the damn thing. Aksyonov, doing ZERO research, stinks of literary connection. And that kills, absolute and total."
2,Not as Kid-Oriented as I'd Hoped,"The authors suggest banning the use of the words ""Yuk"" and ""Do I Have to Eat This?"" I couldn't agree more, and I would start by banning recipes like Salmon Asparagus Roulade, Shrimp and Fish Mornay, Tuna Souffles, and Asparagus Crepes from a kids cookbook. My kids, at least, DON'T love to eat this way. Not exactly what I was hoping to find."
3,Dictionary is complete but complicated,"As a Yiddish student at Binghamton University (SUNY), I purchased a copy of Mr. Wenreich's dictionary to supplement my textbook and to learn more about the Yiddish language. It is very informative and has every expression imaginable in it in both English and Yiddish! Unfortunately, Mr. Weinreich lists many Yiddish words for each English word, without sufficient commentary on each word or phrase. It is sometimes hard to decide which word to use in the context of my sentence from the large list he gives. All in all, I would recommend this dictionary - it is the most complete English-Yiddish Yiddish-English dictionary I have seen. I do feel, however, that the more advanced Yiddish student or speaker could benefit more from this book than a beginner."
4,english yiddish/yiddish english dictionary,I bought this to help me in my yiddish class. But when I got it I found the the yiddish words were in Hebrew style script. I need it to be romanized script.I gave it as a gift to my yiddish teacher because his copy was wearing out. My mitzvah for the day.
4,"Modern English-Yiddish, Yiddish-English Dictionary","Modern English-Yiddish, Yiddish -English Dictionary was what I was looking for - something I needed to help me improve my Yiddish conversation ability."
3,Untitled,"Great price for a classic reference book. Arrived with part of the front cover a bit bent, but otherwise fine."
1,wrong book,"I can't read this book. It has hebrew characters or something. I was hoping to be able to look up a yiddish word (like 'sheyn') in normal characters, and find the english translation. I can not do that in this book. I hope to find an other one. I have send this one back."
4,A nice compilation of Andrew Lloyd Webber music!,"Our 101 FM station here in SW Florida plays great music; and from time to time, I've caught an arrangement of ""Don't Cry For Me, Argentina,"" done to Ravel's ""Bolero."" Now, who would have thought? Anyhow, that, wanting that particular song/arrangement, caused me to scout up the album from which it had come, and I then ordered from Amazon. Good price. Would have preferred being able to just select songs from Amazon's MP3 listings, but the album isn't available in that format. Anyhow, I'm enjoying this group of fourteen songs from the many different productions created by Andrew Lloyd Webber"
1,Not a favorite,"This book was reviewed by my book club.The only member who enjoyed it wasthe one who recommended it to us. I thought it was boring until the end,which was slightly interesting."
1,Why?,"I have tried to pick up this book twice and tried reading it sincerely but I couldn't go past chapter 2.I couldn't understand Tilo's worlds (more of a fantasy) and I felt very bored very quickly, which is usually a big sign for me to get rid of the book in my hand and find a better replacement.Now I have even viewed the trailer of the film made on this movie, acted by Aishwarya Rai...I couldn't bear to watch it!I'm sorry Ms. Chitra, this one didn't digest too well. Better luck next time, hun!"
5,THE MISTRESS OF SPICES,"Divakaruni's words are as fragrant as her spices. While healing others, the heroine goes on extravagant journeys of mingled myth and reality,at once dreamlike and yet so specific and searing that the reader finds the magic of spices not only possible but entirely plausible. This book stuns with its beauty."
3,"Mediocre, cliched, good use of language, but boring","I am an avid reader of fiction. I liked Arranged Marriage, but I couldn't get into this one. It was boring and all the chapters having spice names--mind you, these spices were never referred to in the chapters themselves--seemed extraneous and self-consciously artsy. For the way that the book exoticized the woman, the author should be ashamed. What is this, Rudyard Kipling? The writing itself was OK, but for the flaws in the story, good writing could do nothing to make this a good book. Lastly, Oakland is not as bad as she's made it out to be. But the author playing into stereotypes does nothing to surprise me."
3,Interesting but fluffy,"The book started well even with the make-believe. I read this during my long international flights. I enjoyed reading the parts about how Tilo gets where she is, and how she helps others. But the part about how ""Raven"" gets his name, and about their ""encounters"" at her shop are frankly very boring. Looks like the author lost track and had to get some fluff to fill up her pages towards the end. I'm looking forward to seeing them movie but I hear it is a heavily edited version of the book. Thank God!"
2,Not my cup of cardamom chaa,"Overwrought and a bit amateurish. I'm not a fan of ""exotic"" writing and mostly expect it from non-Indians writing about India and Indians (with ""blue mangoes"" and such in the titles), but not from someone who is herself Indian. Thus, this book was a disappointment for me. For a far more mature, thoughtful and sublime take on the Indian diaspora read Jhumpa Lahiri's 'Interpreter of Maladies'. If you think these two writings are too divergent in genre to bear comparison, something closer to this book's mystical theme would be Rushdie's 'Midnight's Children' which too has more substance than 'Mistress of Spices'."
3,Definitely writeen in a Spicy way!,"The Mistress of Spices is definitely an interesting read. It's written in a poetic unusual way out of the ordinary from most novels. The author uses past tense, present tense and written also in thought form where you hear the character's thoughts only part of the time. This book involves creating a different approach to reading as it takes twists and turns and you have to follow it carefully. The characters are plain and simple and easy to relate to. A story about dedicating yourself to one thing, one purpose despite all temptations. Gives a good insight of an Indian person's thought process."
2,Very Silly At Times,"This book had hills and valleys. Sometimes it was entertaining and other times very silly. It took me almost a week to get through the last 30 pages- I kept falling asleep. I was also at times embarrassed for the characters because of the dialogue.The best parts of the book were the chapters dealing with how the different spices could help the different customers. I also enjoyed the parts in the begining when the main character was describing her training on ""the island"".Raven or ""my American"" (the love interest) had no appeal and he had alot of ridiculous things to say.I love fantasy and I really was looking forward to reading this book. It started out good and then slide into the land of the sillies"
3,One half of this book is worth it,"I recently re-read this book because I vaguely remembered liking it. I realize know why the feeling was a vague memory. The first half of the book is well-written and fabulistic in the best sense. The writing style fits the way the secondary characters and their experiences are introduced. Tilo's mythical story is also fascinating.But, with the introduction of the rich, handsome, exotic Raven, the story completely flounders. Tilo breaks many of the rules assigned to her. And the Old One and her return to the island are abandoned at the end without a second thought. I agree with a previous reviewer that it resembles a Harlequin novel. It made me want to throw the book across the room.A great first half, undermined by a flaccid 2nd half."
4,Plot versus Substance.. Ane the winner is...,"While reading this colorful, lyrical story, it is easy to be transported by the present-tense, sing-song prose, enigmatic imagery and sensual descriptions. After closing the book and gaining some distance, one begins to see how simple and predictable is the story line. But while steeped in the fragrant brew of the narrative as it progresses... Ahhh! it is so easy to be captivated. Very original style and point of view. Deliciously original premise! Somewhat flat plot and even flatter resolution. In my opinion, the style in this case outweighs the substance. And what a style!"
4,Definitely worth reading,"The book flows very well. The realism of lives revealed to Tilo is chilling. I was specially dumb sturk by the story of Lalita. The cause of battered women, especially Indian is usually lost in honor and societal pressures. It is very difficult for members of an individualistic culture to understand the societal demands placed on a Indian woman. With her really great manner of writting, Ms. Divakaruni is able to present the case in simple terms.Even though the book flows very well, I think the ending of the book did not do justice to the rest of book. It was the sort of anticlimax I was not expecting and was not prepared for. The reason for Raven to come after Tilo was not strong enough. Reason for Tilo's intense desire for Raven still needed work.On the whole, however, the book is worth reading. I will never walk into an Indian grocery store and look at the woman behind the counter the same way agai"
4,An Interesting Book for the Classroom...,"I taught this book as part of a Women's Studies course, and found that my students really enjoyed it because it was so different from anything else they had ever read. C.B. Divakaruni tends to be a favorite author with students anyway, because of her well-painted characters, imaginative details, and interesting plot development. This book is also very mystical in nature, and contains an unusual mix of ordinary daily activity, with prominent elements of folklore and magic. A wonderful book for anyone craving a taste of the unusual."
4,Something to Read and Think about,"Many reviewers disliked this book for its cliched plot. I too was dissatisfied with what seemed to me to be a mismatch between an exquisite writing style and what seemed to be a banal story. I think each reader can take more away from this novel than the triteness of the romance. In fact, I think that this apparent conflict between story and style works well to show the reader that what is on the surface is never all that is there. An old message, of course, but one that bears repeating."
2,Disappointing,"This book started off strong, with lush prose impressively pulled off. But then maybe 1/3 of the way into it, the narrative became increasingly repetitive and tiresome. Oh Tilo, you must resist your desires. Oh Tilo, you're going to get in trouble. Page after page of this finally made me give up on the whole book altogether. I don't think I'm alone on this one, I've seen several used copies adorning the shelves of Half Price Books. Such a disappointment after her wonderful collection of short stories, ""Arranged Marriage."" Some of the same compassionate spirit shines through the writing in ""Mistress of Spices,"" but the narrative device dragged it down until it drowned."
5,a unigue approach to storytelling,"I loved the way the author used the spice shop to weave small stories about the lives of many characters. I also liked that in all cases the mistress let compassion rule, even when it was a danger to herself. The ending was satisfying too...END"
2,disappointing,"It started out quite promising - beautiful prose.. However, as you read further, you discover a rather boring cliche plot. The ending was blah - so hollywood-esque. It was disappointing for it could have been better."
3,A mysterious illusion from reality.,"The book started out for me a little odd becuase of all the make-believe story telling. After reading the book for a while you start to get into it a little more and it builds itself up to where it makes you want to finish to read the end. A suprisingly odd ending is very unexpected to the reader, but still leaves room for imagination.Overall this is a good book, definitly not my own choice, but again nothing that I thought wasted my time with."
1,"not a fairy tale, not a fiction, well.. not a novel!",I read the author's columns in magazines. I really like her simple effective writings. But this book deceived me. not so good.
1,"Disapointing, racist, cliche & predictable",I HATED THIS BOOK. I would NOT recommend this to any one. I was insulted in every predictable chapter. I thought the comparison of this to Like Water for Chocolate is EXTREMELY MISLEADING.
5,A Culinary Delight!,"This book might as well be classified as culinary fiction. I was hungry for more with every flip of the page. Every word, every description, left me aching for more. The book comes alive with its vivid descriptions. I enjoyed reading it, however make sure you keep a snack or two on the side..it will make you hungry.Banerjee is a masterpiece storyteller. Her characters leap from the pages and into your heart. If you read this, I would also recommend ""Arranged Marriage"" along side it."
4,the Mistress of Spices,"Incorporating the magical with the real, this novel follows the life of Tilo, a woman with magical powers who decides to become a Mistress of Spices. Divakaruni uses intense imagery and vivid descriptions to narrate the story. Her style verges on prose, utilizing sentence fragments, distinct punctuation, and strange paragraph formats for an interesting and compelling read.In addition, Divakaruni develops a story that places a mystical character in an ordinary setting: Oakland, California. She combines Tilo's exciting life as an immortal being with the lives of every-day mortals in an effort to contrast the two extremes. With the presence of Tilo, the reader is able to view the commoners in Oakland as special people. Tilo, however, begins to feel jealousy at their lives, rich with human contact and emotion. When a strange American man enters the shop and steals Tilo's heart, she begins to question her decision to be a Mistress- is this the life for her?"
2,very disappointing!,"I found the book to be very well written but inconsistent! Example a modern day handsome, rich, wall-street type hero, called Raven who has a childish grudge against his mother that last a life time. If that isn't a little odd, he falls in love with a wrinkly, aged stooped lady! Characters are weak and not well-developed. At the conclusion, the reader would ask- what was the point? what was the story?"
2,marketing exoticism,"The fact that this book was originally sold along with a packet of 'exotic' spices should alert the reader to the at times ridiculous brand of pseudo-eastern mysticism therein. By the end of the book, we are convinced only that divakaruni has a sound grasp of how south asia should be marketed to salacious readers eager to glimpse an imagined oriental fantasy-land."
3,Not very tasty,"I love sesame flavor but found this brand bland and runny. I would not discourage anyone from buying it, I just expected stronger flavor."
1,Unreliable Reviews,The review below (by Trading Markets) is written by the authors' collaborators and employers (at least in the past - I havent followed them recently). They also probably published the book so the review is not reliable.Previous books by these teams have been a bit lightweight and only suitable for beginners.Try to find an independent review before buying this book.
4,Must read for new traders,"As a self-assessed intermediate-level trader, I can say with all certainty that the ideas in this book are really worth a look. Only after months of losing money despite finding great trading opportunites with stratgies from Jeff Cooper and Larry Connors, I realized how important locking in profits became. Unfortunately, it is more than knowing but the daily practice of discipline that makes for a great trader. I know that I am on that road now and I wish that the ideas from this book were ones that I heeded before I started. For all you would be traders out there, read this book first, read Cooper's books and then re-read The Real Holy Grail again before making your first trade. It could save you thousands of dollars during you early trading days if you listen to what these traders say."
3,Information on Origin is not complete,"The format is clear, but all the information on origins are not included. For example, the book states trapezius originates on the occiput and C7 to T12. That's true enough, but it makes no mention of the EOP, superior medial nuchal line, and ligamentum nuchae. The info is not always complete. The used price is great. The book has a clean format and all the infomation about a particular muscle is on one page...no excessive flipping back and forth, I like the format much better than Biel's Trail Guide to the Body, but incomplete info is a problem. I wouldn't recommend for anyone that needs concise information, for example, if you are testing for a national or state exam."
4,Excellent simple read,"This was a fairly easy book to follow. Nice and concise, just like the title says. A nice concise bible to have around. Could have possibly gone into deeper explanations of the muslces. Very thorough for a small book."
5,How warm and fuzzy can one get?,I stayed warm and fuzzy and laughing hysterically throughout this book......what memories this book brought back! Michael catches all the childhood memories anyone wants to remember and then some....thank you for making me laugh again!
4,Dynamic Teaching on the Holy Spirit,"I am not a Charismatic or Pentecostal so there are a few things I disagree with but overall I find Brother Hinn's books to be very helpful. The Holy Spirit is God: all-knowing, all-powerful. Brother Hinn has taught us how to tap into that power so we can be used of God for His purposes. We have to let go of our inhibitions and let God have His will and way in us. Then the Holy Spirit can truly fill us (on a daily basis) and use us for the furtherence of the Kingdom. We just have to get out of God's way."
1,"unwelcome Benny Hinn, how NOT to know the Holy Spirit",Another Benny Hinn twisted scriptures and just wild imagination.
1,introduction to spiritism,I would recommend this book about spiritist experience to those who want to be lead by satans and his demons or any angel of light. Scary but impressive.
3,"Welcome, Holy Spirit: How You Can Experience The Dynamic Work Of The...",Have not had a chance to read this book because a friend wanted to borrow it. I have since to have it returned but she said that it was really good. I trust her judgment.
4,Another hits compilation,This hit collection consists of the following: Who's Sorry Now/Stupid Cupid/My Happiness/Lipstick On Your Collar/Among My Souvenirs/Mama/Everybody's Somebody's Fool/My Heart Has A Mind of Its Own/Where the Boys Are/Breakin' In A Brand New Broken Heart/Don't Break The Heart That Loves You/Vacation. Original hit recordings.
3,Lackluster,"I agree with most of the other individuals who have written comments. The first piece, ""The Short Tempered Clavier"" is, by far, the best piece on the CD. The other works seem oddly derivative of it. There isn't the usual variety in the pieces which Schickele includes (one or two instrumental, one or two vocal). My personal suspicion is that since, years ago, Schickele announced his intention to stop his P.D.Q. Bach work in order to focus on serious compositions, this CD may have been part of a contractual obligation, or, perhaps, just an effort to get the last of the P.D.Q. Bach pieces recorded.While the ""Short Temepered Clavier"" is a good piece, its probably not worth the price of the CD. If you were looking for a good P.D.Q. Bach album, I'd buy ""Oedipus Tex"" or ""1712 Overture"" or even the lesser-known (but really funny) ""Lieberslieder Polkas and Twelve Quite Heavenly Songs""."
2,Some good tracks,"I enjoyed the Short-Tempered Clavier pieces tremendously. Played masterfully by Christopher O'Reilley, they are witty and delightful. A new suprise is always around the corner, and upon my first listen I found myself grinning and sometimes laughing out loud.Then comes the rest of the album.In the succeeding pieces, Schickele uses the same jokes, the same tunes, and crummy synthesized instruments that become so annoying that I just want to turn the thing off.Do yourself a favor and leave after the first act."
1,THIS ONE NEEDS SALVATION!!,"This Deathlands novel is like night to day from the last one. Where the last title BREAKTHROUGH was fresh and original, this new one can't be anymore different. The storyline is so lame and boring with so many flaws, its the most painfully to read that I wished the company would rescind this novel completely - as if it never was written! This is not a good way to introduce your new ""look"" much less give us hardcore fans this half-baked story. There are too many deathlands fans and ex-fans clamoring to make this series end it seems, but I know there are too many talented writers out there that can keep this series alive and vibrant, and take it to its rightful next level. It even seems that the cover artist Michael Herring also hated the story because this cover was boring and not as well drawn as his others. Its as if the artist ""felt"" what we are feeling in his art. Please Gold Eagle publishers and editors, don't let this wonderful series go in this direction again!"
2,Well the cover looks nice....,That is where all the good things about these book ends. It is just a [replay] of better deathlands books that had the same plot. If I had to think of a witty visual aid it would be like starting a book with a perfectly good horse. At around page 50 someone kills the horse and then drags it along for another 200 pages....
3,More conspiracy than action.,"The elements once again threaten the group, then comes the hman factor. The action in this book happens rather briskly and is occupied by some deep conspiracy. Still a good book overall."
5,A book to jump start a Christian who is feeling down about their relationship with Christ,I really enjoyed this book. It was part of the assigned reading for a Spiritual Formation retreat I took through my college. The collected devotionals in this book are wonderful. I like the different sections included in the book as well. If you want to just read devotionals to stir up your prayer life you can just read that section.Also at the end of each devotional there are reflection questions and spiritual discipline exercises to do. I found this to be very helpful in breaking out of the routine in my devotional time with God.
5,Extremely interesting,"I love the wisdom of the aged, and the ancient espcially when it is truth about Jesus Christ our Lord, and true Christianity."
3,Great intro to spiritual growth,"Due to the fact that I was in an abusive church, I tended to distrust anything that smacked of mysticism or spirituality that bypassed the brain. Nevertheless, I have been more open of late to works that attempt to speak more to the heart and not just the head - to the whole person, if you will. This is a great intro to this end giving good pieces that are worth meditating on.For me, I ignore the questions. I don't need more ""do the following steps to be spiritual"". I find just reading each piece slowly over and over for a week or so allows me to move the truths from just an intellectual understanding to change in the heart and will."
4,Classic,This book will help you get in touch with early churchmen as they tried to reach God. They pour out their hearts as best they know how to experience God. Be careful to not get caught up in all their exploits. We live in another age. Our culture is far removed. Be careful that you seek to understand their context as you read the many different authors within the devotional.
3,Anti-Ecumenists should read with caution...,"I've only just got this book, and so far, have found it a very good read and well Bible-based. However, it may bother or even offend somebody who may be looking for a book that's exclusively from their own Christian denomination (i.e., a Catholic looking for a devotional made exclusively from and for Catholics); the excerpts in this devotional are from both Catholic and Protestant writers from the past!If you get bothered about different denominations together in one book, but you still want to read it, then do so with a grain of salt!Otherwise, go ahead and see if you like it! It's up to you!"
5,SIMPLY AMAZING!,This collection of works throughout the time since Christ walked the earth is simply amazing! Not only does it provide a historical example but it is spiritually satisfying as well!
3,"Relatively ordinary thriller, nice twist at the end","This turned out to be a rather ordinary thriller, though the ending was more interesting than the rest of the movie indicated. Gregory Hines wasn't the best choice for the lead role, he seems more whiney than anything else, but the rest of the cast was good. Michael Harris shines in a small role; he was very under-utilized here. A definite waste of talent. But I still enjoyed the movie, particularly the conclusion."
3,Erroneous picture,"Be careful what you are ordering. The picture is of a wiper blade, but this is actually refills only!!"
3,Horrid Dubbing,"Somewhere between comedy and horror, the Host is an interesting movie with many different layers to it. There is certainly a fair amount of social commentary in the movie. It is scary at times, though the authorities in the movie are far more scary than the monster. Somehow, it just did not seem to fully work as either comedy or horror for me, and I think language may have been the biggest issue.I made the mistake of watching the English dubbed version instead of opting for Korean and subtitles. The dubbing was atrocious. One wonders at what third rate drama club the producers found these voice ""actors."" In many cases, the drama, emotion, horror or comedy of a scene was totally destroyed by bad voice work. I do recommend the film. It's more interesting than 99% of horror films produced in the United States today, even if it is a bit long and confusing at times. I also highly recommend avoiding the dubbing if at all possible."
3,"Over-hyped, but good effort - 3 stars barely","This movie is NOT, I repeat, NOT on par with Jaws or Aliens as the reviews printed on the cover claim, but it is what it is -- an average monster flick with semi-cool special effects and over-the-top acting. Nothing new here. If you haven't seen the film yet, you may want to rent it or just skip it if you are not a monster movie mega-fan.TIP FOR BETTER VIEWING:Be sure to use watch the film in its original Korean with English subtitles. DO NOT watch the English dubbed version. The movie was horribly dubbed. I mean BAD!"
5,Great Movie,"This movie is great. It's not meant to be a complete horror movie. There's comedy, there's semi scary moments, there's drama. The movie has it all. Give it a chance, and don't have the misconception that it's supposed to be a really scary monster movie. The monster is done well, but it's not about the monster. It's about the family in the movie and how they all come together because of the monster.Watch it. It's great."
4,"For a good time, rent the host","Listen. Sometimes you just need a dang good time, and there is no shame in that. Ah, it's all true. The Korean horror film The Host is absolutely spectacular, even with needing a 20 minute trim. Rent it before you read a review or see a trailer that spoils all the fun. This film is on par with Tremors and Sean of the Dead, and you know how often one of those exhilerating masterpieces comes along."
4,Don't watch the dubbed version...,"I purchased this movie and I was surprised that I actually liked it, I just heard awful things about it. First I watched the movie in its original form with subtitles, I laughed and was in suspense at certain parts.. Then I decided to watch the dubbed version afterwards, it totally ruined the movie.. This movie already has a campy feel, with overacting-- but when you have english dubbs with 5x more very bad overacting-- it totally takes away from the movie.. So just watch the subtitle version!!! Yes the father was an annoying character, he was a slacker who only made things worse. But towards the end he finally became a man, and was trying to ""save the day"", which made his character watchable.. Just rent it and judge for yourself.. But I say if you really enjoyed slither, then most likely you will enjoy this too.."
5,A GREAT monster movie,"This has to rank as one of the best and most eccentric monster movies of all time. It is scary, funny, and so sad. This is a movie I will watch several times. The monster for the most part is a great piece of computer work."
2,Something's wrong underneath....,"After all the great reviews I'd read -- including a particularly persuasive rave in ""The New Yorker"" -- I was primed to see this horror-comedy about a pollution-bred monster running wild in a Korean sewer system.But despite its smooth look and admirable camerawork, ""The Host"" is surprisingly uneffective. Aside from the moster's brisk initial attack, the action isn't exciting and the comedy isn't especially funny. In fact, large sections of this film are just boring.I'll take an anti-hero any day of the week, but the family here is so hapless and sad they quickly become maddening.It's great to see a thriller with ambitions beyond the typical PG-13 slasher flicks, or the hard R-rated torture chamber endurance matches, but ""The Host"" has a long way to go before it's in a league with ""Jaws"" or ""Alien"" as some have suggested.Disappointing."
2,A mix which is... too mixed,"Hmmm... I REALLY wanted to love this movie. I had read great reviews and the creature effects were done by New Zealand's very own Weta Workshop (its good to be a kiwi)...But I didn't really enjoy it. The director was obviously trying to do something different by mixing different genres however all it achieved was confusing the viewer. I found myself not knowing how to watch the movie - it was a monster movie.. with no tension, it was a comedy.. which wasn't really funny, it was a drama... where you didn't care about the characters...Overall it tried to be too many things and didn't achieve any of them.Good effects, but disjointed and ultimately disappointing."
2,I've Been Duped!!,"I really don't know what is going on with the reviews for this movie, but this movie is NOT GOOD! The only reason I gave it two stars is because when the monster is on screen, the scenes are actually pretty good. Unfortunately that doesn't happen enough. I am not sure if the movie loses something in the English dubbed version, but there was some dialogue that didn't even make sense. And what is up with the dad grabbing his junk in the middle of the gym floor after grieving the possible death of his daughter? Say what? There are many good reviews on the box of this movie, but I have a feeling that they were taken out of context. Here are the real reviews. ""On par with Jaws...If Jaws were a cheesy, overacted Korean movie with major plot holes."" ""This is not...One of the greatest monster movies ever made."" Trust me."
4,fun korean monster movie.,This is a well made Korean monster movie. It's got humour and lots of great scenes. This is topnotch sci fi really and it's a fast paced movie. This was a hit movie in korea and was good enough to be shown over here. We need double features back because good movies like this one need a outlet here. The acting is very good too. On blu ray this looks great and it's a newer movie and that helps. It harkens back to the old monster on the loose movies and in this case the monster just wants to live actually. A fine flick that the korean's loved and so do I. It has english subtitles as well.
2,"Bad, In Any Language",I gave up on this picture long before the final credits rolled. It was just simply....... terrible.
1,"I wouldn't want this ""host"" at my party","This had to be one of the worst movies I've ever watched. Bad dubbing,bad acting,stupid story and a silly monster. It was so dumb I skipped to the end just to see how the monster was destroyed. That too was ridiculous."
1,Terrible,"I cannot believe that reviewers have actually given this piece of junk more than one star. It was horrible. The ""MONSTER"" looked like a plastic toy. The ""PLOT"" was pretty simple and plodding (as well as predictable). I guess I could take one of my rubber toys, magnify it a couple of times and make a movie myself to much acclaim.By the way, why was this piece of junk called ""The Host""? Why wasn't it just called ""The Fish"" or something that made sense. What really got me was that a review on the cover of the DVD compared it favorably to Jaws. What a lie!! Thank goodness that I borrowed it for free from my local library - if I had paid a penny, it would have been war."
1,"how do you say ""really sucks"" in Korean?",This was a total waste of two hours. The only reason I watched the whole thing was to see if anyone else died in this horrible sorry excuse for a horror flick. Another reviewer mentioned that this was supposed to be a satirical spoof of other stupid monster movies. I think not. Its just really bad. The acting was so over the top and/or amateurish that I had to laugh. Laughing my arse off at times. Then I got angry because it portrayed Koreans as a bunch of melodramatic buffoons. This was beyond campy and cheesy. I would rather watch Godzookie vs Mothra.
1,Low budget flick,"First of, I really thought this movie was going to be good after reading some of the reviews. Its very low budget with bad acting and anti-American sentiment. I dont understand why this movie got any good reviews. During the movie, when they're searching for this creature, that looks like a Giant Northern Pike. The family is the one who happens to find it almost every time. The army is lost, never really in the movie. Just a sad,typical monster movie, made in Asia. Like the ones from the 60's and 70's. If you like those types of movies you will dig this one."
1,Just don't...,"Don't waste your time on this so called movie. A kid in 2nd grade school could put together a better movie than this. I feel mislead by people giving it high marks. I've never left a movie review on Amazon before (I'm usually pretty forgiving and go along with plot line, ignoring the obvious), but I felt I needed to add my warning to those tempted by positive reviews."
3,The Host?,"Just purchased this one the other day, and I must say its not really a horrible movie but I'm not feeling the urge to go back and watch it over and over again like I usually do with the movies that I like. I will say the creature effects were excellent, but the story seemed corny to me."
3,"Great movie, glitchy HD DVD","I loved this movie, but am very disappointed with the HD DVD.It looks and sounds amazing, but more than two copies either froze in spots or did not play at all. Hopefully Magnolia fixes these problems soon."
3,Solid Popcorn Flick,"As politically irresponsible as this film is at times, it's hard to take seriously with it's slapstick humor, quirky characters, and CGI violence. That said, I'm unsure why I've seen this film on several Top Ten lists recently; yet, that's not to say that there's anything here that a bag of popcorn can't solve. (6/10)"
3,Its not on par with Jaws and other good movie,"I usually rent, but i paid for this flick, cause it was advertized as onpar with other good monster movie. The monster itself is good, detailedand original and is a joy to look at, but the rest of the movie could havebeen done better. At some point i think i fell asleep for a while.I hope the american can remake it better, it deserves another chance.Dont buy...rent !"
5,Eccentric-Campy-Terrifying-Funny Thriller,This is exactly what a good movie should be....watch it in it's original Korean soundtrack and just read the subtitles because it's way better that way. One of my all-time favorite monster movies. People who only watch Hollywood movies should not watch this because they won't get it....(sorry for the snark remark but it is true).Enjoy peeps!
1,Very disapointing,"I purchased this movie based on general critics, that seemed to praise it. This is a very boring movie, that I would have rated ""B"", because of very crappy acting, outdated special effects, and general storyline. My wife and I did not finish it, and we resold it on ebay after only 3 days."
1,The WORST Movie!,This movie is a total waste of time. Its non-scary and uncreative. If this is the highest grossing movie in Korea then shame on the Korean film industry for producing such garbage!
1,Grossly over-rated bore!,"Except for the CGI effects, this was no better than one of those 3rd rate Godzilla sequels. Don't waste your time or money! Dialog? Laughable! Idiot plot? You bet. Comparisons to true classic monster/horror/sci-fi movies? Laughable! There was more tension in final installment of American Idol than there was in this ""fish story."" The holes in the plot are too numerous to mention! If you must see it, rent it from Net Flix but I warn you...The Host is one of the lamest sci-fi/horror movies made in the last quarter century!"
1,oop's not again,"THIS movie was so bad i sold my dvd for 2 bucks, and i told the buyer to burn it. It like watching a monster movie back in the 1960's. sucks big time"
1,not worth watching,"There is so much wrong with this movie that it is not worth watching. You will feel cheated. There are a few good-looking scenes that you can see on YouTube. The Koreans were trying to make a Hollywood-style movie; but there is no plot, no characters, and no sense at all to the story. I could go on about how ridiculous most of the scenes are, but why bother. The soundtrack is laughable; and the English-voice dubbing is awful."
5,Fun Movie,"Fun movie for older viewers, not for the younger to watch. Great twists to the movie. Bit campy at times but that is part of the viewing fun."
2,Boring.,Maybe something was lost in translation or in the culture difference but I've spent a couple years in Korea. Just a bit convoluted and boring. Good effects though.
2,Disappointing,What I expected was a thrilling monster-movie (something we're seriously lacking these days) but what I got (aside from the first half-hour) is an ultimate BOREFEST. The ending was a severe disappointment and it just seemed to get sillier as it went along. The FX was fairly impressive but I recommend a film like Cloverfield for a seriously exciting/good monster movie.
1,Just because its a foreign film doesn't mean its good.,I watched this after reading a few of the good reviews. I should have read all the bad ones.This movie just plain sucked. By the end I was hoping the monster would kill everybody.
2,"Great video quality, crapy movie","The only thing that this movie had going for it was the fact that it was great for actual video quality. The Content however was CRAP; the film is of Korean origin and is dubbed in English with some very bad voiceovers! The ""monster"" was introduced way to early in the movie leaving suspense out of the movie entirely for that aspect. Throughout the entire movie though it seemed as though suspense was not even a thought they just had the critter running around at all times and that was it.Overall;Video = great qualityStory = Sucked a big one!"
3,OK. Not as good as I'd hoped though,"This was an OK movie. I bought it after seeing the trailer and thought it would make a good addition to my HD movie list. It is NOT however, in my opinion, ""on par with Jaws"" as the box says. Jaws is probably my all time favorite movie and this just didn't live up to that. The CG was really good and the story wasn't bad. Unfortunately it has that campy, jokey feel you see all too often in Asian movies. I'm not sure why they do that. It also seems to loose something when the movie is dubbed into English. It just loses something, I dunno. That's just my opinion. The other reviews are correct in stating that the disc freezes in 2 spots of the film. Hitting fast forward cleared it. I know it's not my player because I watched 300 after watching that and had no issues. This is one for my cheesy movie collection, unfortunately. This had SO much potential."
4,Another Great Korean Daddy Movie,"The monster looks awesome, the subplots are tight, there is lots of death and a bittersweet ending. It's everything a monster movie should be, but alas, it's in Korean. If you like subtitles, this is worth watching. The only gripe I have about the CGI are the flames at the end otherwise it's perfect. I also recommend Old Boy."
4,the Host Blu-Ray review,"This blu-ray rocks! The color, the saturation and clarity - everything about this disc is excellent. Highly recommended! One of the most entertaining films, I've seen in a while. Right up there with Tremors and Jurassic Park, but with a darker edge. I love the creature. I'm looking forward to the sequel."
4,Korean Kult Klassic,"Great movie on BD. Crisp, clear and refreshing. It is the story of a family sticking together at all costs. A nice blend of humanism mixed with a CGI beast from the depths of murky waters, government conspiracy and brain surgery.The story keeps you engaged most of the time. Monster effects are good, not the best. That is why it gets 4/5. The acting is good, you'll like most of the main characters.Nice to see something of this magnitude make its way to the States, just goes to show what you are missing if you don't think outside of the box we call USA."
1,Korean Comedy,"If you're expecting a horror movie or suspense thriller - forget it. If you want a good spoof laugh, this is your movie... The dialog (Korean to English translation) is very funny - completely at home in a comedy (which I don't think this movie was meant to be). Story line is so so, acting is pretty good, creature is pretty good too (sort of a big fish with legs that can run pretty fast). I didn't realise I'd purchased this movie by mistake while buying a few other sci-fi titles. I put off watching this until I'd watched all the others as I don't generally like horror type movies (don't like the taste of adrenalin) - it was funny, but I'll probably try to offload it to ebay."
3,Better holsters out for the money,"First of all the holster is very high quality, everything about it feels luxurious. I could just never get it comfortable enough to carry my Glock 27.It's also very expensive compared to similar holsters, it's double what I paid for the Crossbreed (which works like a champ)See if you can get your hands on one in a gun shop, I know some people who absolutely swear by the Royal Guard."
5,This book should be in every pilot's reference library,"Dennis Pagen has professionalized the presentation of HG instruction in many works, and deserves the gratitude of HG pilots world wide.This book, and the clear presentation of important concepts of thermaling, cross country flying, and speed-to-fly theory make it a gem of gliding knowledge for weekend and competition pilots."
5,Expanding our flights,"Until reading this book I was concentrating on unnecessary things during flight. It helps you get over the basics with clear instructions, and moves on to more advanced techniques like cross, towing, aerobatics. a real must foar ALL hang gliding pilots."
4,Excelent material - a bit out of date,Very good book but it was out in 1993. The sections listing instramentation need to be updated to reflect the electronics of today and to list the improvements of the new generation gliders. I would guess that this book will not be updated anytime soon if ever so don't let that keep you from this material. It is a great book none the less.
1,Im definately returning this book...,"When I read the title of this book I thought it meant that the recipes included good carbs (ie whole grains) however this is just another meat cookbook recommending a low carb or no carb diet which is not healthy according to my doctor. If you are on a low or no carb diet and need a cookbook to tell you how to make omelettes and tuna salad then this is the book for you. I found it to be a waste of money and plan to return it. There is actually a recipe for a green salad, which is iceberg lettuce, green peppers, and oil and vinegar dressing.... I am not an advanced cook by any means, in fact I would most likely classify myself as a beginner, but I certainly dont need a recipe for lettuce with oil and vinegar... Bottom line - dont waste your money!"
4,Very good atlas of breast imaging,"Despite its age, this book is an excellent text outlining breast pathology, in a concise atlas. Image quality is good (but can be improved). Captions describe the imaging findings and many captions are accompanied by helpful teaching points.Modalities covered including conventional film screen mammography, ultrasound and antiquated MRI images.This is a solid book on differentials and pitfalls related to breast imaging."
1,Absolutely one of the worst books I've ever read,"They should retitle the book ""A Big Pack of Infuriating and Manipulting Lies"" This book has nothing to do with God or Angels or Divine Teachings."
1,Absolutely bizarre incoherency from a guy who claims . . .,". . . to be the Angel of North America. The one to whom God told the secrets of how to live in harmony so that humanity is not plunged into another Dark Ages.Read it for a laugh, and then shed some tears for a man who is 1) hopelessly insane, 2) So evil that he will say or do anything to earn money off people's fears, 3) simply odd and not quite coherent.The author is the Angel's wife, and she was written down what the Angel says to her. One wonders at the honesty of this couple, but of course, I cannot say anything against, them, either. Certainly a fair amount of this book is good theology - be nice, do good, be concerned for your soul, marry with the attitude that marriage is lifetime commitment, and a few others. But it's just plain odd, and very, very creative (in a bad way) at times with theology."
2,Disappointment,"We recently purchased this disk with high anticipation, as we have always considered all Kunzel/Telarc disks to be excellent. We also love gospel music, and the tracks listed are some of our favorites. Having said that, we were very disappointed with the mixing on this disk. The orchestra is too 'pushed back' and the vocals are too 'up front'. The end result is neither realistic, nor enjoyable in our estimation. We were very disappointed with the quality overall."
3,Accurate description,Wilton 18 pc Starter Cake decorating set is exactly as it is described. It is the very basics needed to start decorating (a good place to start again) but it is the same great quality that I have always gotten from Wilton. Good product. Great price.
2,Really just a starter kit..,"I am a beginer to cake decorating. This kit came with everything I needed to BEGIN. Sadly, the dyes are for use one time and are not resealable."
5,Totally unique rarity!,"Think a folky gentle giant and this is about as close as you can get to this remarkable album, but the link is pretty slight. This was recorded in 1972 and is quite unique and VERY original. The music is very complex, there is use of acoustic instruments paticularly glockenspiel which all adds to its charm. The band don't really stretch out, but each song builds a mood slightly similar to the atmospheric work of Mr Fox without the bad musicianship(!) on 'the gypsy' Sindelfingen are no slouches on their instruments and my only criticism of this is that it is so short (36 minutes with bonus) whereas they could had fitted the limited edition live album to stretch things out. Still if you like unusual prog/folk from the early seventies you should buy it!"
2,just a bunch of scott henderson clones,"Sounds like everyone here is trying to be a Scott Henderson clone, but he already did this kind of stuff years ago much better than these players. Just get all the Tribal Tech CD's instead."
2,Disappointment...,"A bunch of great guitarists dealing with John Coltrane's complex harmonies. Quite every jazz player considers Coltrane as one of the most rappresentative and influential musician in the world; I love all the musicians playing in this album, they all have the harmony knowledge to play on the intricate Coltrane's chord changes, BUT...it seems they never listened to his songs, to his sounds, to the magic athmosphere he was able to create on his albums. That dreamy sensation is the main thing lacking here in my opinion. Playing in a Coltrane tribute is NOT ONLY playing over Coltrane chords! Here it's like some good guitar players practising...where's the Tribute??Besides, in Giant Steps (soloist: Greh Howe) why mix a kind of Hendrix's Foxy Lady in the main theme???I would have expected something more, considering skill of such guitarsits.Maybe a too commercial project?"
3,"Mixed bag of Coltrane ""attempts"".","Like the other reviewers, once I had gotten past the technique and "" licks"" I noticed that , with the exception of the inspiring Eric Johnson's version of Resolution, the rest seem to be severely lacking in understanding Coltrane's music.It was obvious to anyone who has listened to Coltrane that apart from being vastly gifted on an instrument and incredibly intelligent he was above all else a very spiritual man. Hendrix on the sax, if you will.This did not come across at all, and I think is reflected in a majority of the players on this album.Average."
4,AWESOME,"I really wish this was a movie. It was like Predator 1 and Aliens combined. The ending could of been better, with the advanced aliens doing more damage than usual, or make it seem like a real war between the species but still a great finish to the 3 book series with the female lead."
2,Go read 'AvP: War',"This book is mediocre, at best. Sure, it's got some action, and yes, it's an AvP book (for which it gets points), but other than that, go read 'AvP: War' by S.D. Perry. Weak plot and underdeveloped characters don't help HP out much."
3,Did I miss something??,I was a little confused at the beginning of this novel about how she was back with humanity. It seemed as though I missed something. Later on it explains but it still seems as if this book came to early in the series. I liked it overall but it is not the best it could be. The whole android thing was cool but the ending was horrible. I suggest a read only to fans of the series cause if your not a fan you won't become one reading this book.
4,Qiute Enjoyable,"Now I know everyone else that has reviewed this book will probably freak at me for saying this, but I did actually quite enjoy this book. Mind you, I enjoy just about anything to do with the 'yautja', so just read it as a starter, because things can only get better"
3,"Disappointed, but not bad","Its true what they say, the first one is always the best one. This book wasn't bad at all, but I was disappointed. In AvP: Prey(book 1) the authors give you a point of view on the Predators side. Here, it's not the case. It kinda goes back to the movies and only shows you or lets you know what the humans are doing, thinking, etc. There were a few small details in this book that I liked, and thought that was kool. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to know what happens to Noguchi after reading book 1."
3,Stays with the story,"I enjoyed this book, but not as good as the first one in the series, I love how she was able to join the Predator tribe but dousn't fit in and she's better than everybody and there trying to kill her. other than the book's good action sequences this book just dousn't compare to the first one."
2,A Sequel for Suckers,"This was a pathetic attempt by David Bischoff to recapture the adventure and excitement of its predecessor, ""Aliens vs. Predator: Prey."" It had a bad plot, unconvincing characters, and, overall, just wasn't written very well. And as far as Mr. Bischoff's comment concerning liking ALIEN Resurrection and liking this book - I don't think so. I just saw Resurrection today, and while the ending leaves something (okay, a lot!) to be desired, it's totally different (and not to mention better) than this book! My advice? Avoid. Oh yeah, and while you're at it, you can avoid his ALIENS novel, ""Genocide,"" as well (boring)! -Ember"
3,"Not bad, but not what most Predator fans are looking for","You can definitely tell that different authors wrote Prey & Hunter's Planet. Whereas Prey is focused on action and splits its points of view between human and Predator, this book is much more focused on plot twists and on Machiko Noguchi. To be honest, I found it a dull read. The plot twists are too convenient, the action is rushed, and there's far too much time wasted on developing characters who exist only to be killed off within a couple of pages. I wish we could have seen more through the Predator Bakuub's eyes rather than only Machiko's. He seemed liked a promising character, but he was never developed. It's not badly written, it just isn't written with Predator fans in mind."
2,Just didn't do it for me...,"Aliens vs. Predator: Prey rocked, and though I understand it might be difficult to live up to Perry's example, I think it could have been sooo much better."
5,GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"HEY, THIS BOOK IS GREAT.I JUST KINDA GOT MAD AT THE ENDING. BECAUSE, WELL IF YOU READ IT, I THINK YOU WILL KNOW WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT. BUT IF YOU ARE THINKING ABOUT GETTING THIS BOOK, GET IT. DONT CHANGE YOUR MIND, OR ELSE YOU WILL BE VERY DISAPOINTED. JUST ONE THING I DIDNT LIKE ABOUT THE BOOK IS THAT HE SAID NONTHELESS TO MUCH. BUT THAT DONT MAKE IT A BAD BOOK. IT IS THE GREATEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ."
1,The sequel to Prey was not what I had hoped for.,"Perry did a great job with Prey. He captured the effect of the characters that would please both fans of the movies Aliens and Predator. This sequel, however, did not cut it. Though the plot line was there it was quite boring and did not have a promising story line. This guy should go back to his trek books because he ain't doing any good here."
2,"hmm, doesnt quite cut it...","After reading the first book (prey), I was very excited to find out that a sequel was avalable. Boy was this book a let down! I re-read prey before reading this, and I was disappointed to see how the main character was changed beyond recognition. Might as well given her a new identity, cause she aint the same! The book was extremly slow (not as bad as star wars:children of the jedi though!) and was VERY inconsistant... the predators might have had rubber chickens, cause they sucked hard in this book... I thought they were STRONGER than the aliens! gez this book sucked! We want Perry back!"
1,Why oh why?,"After an exciting trilogy of Alien novels and the first AVP novel, what the hell were the publishers thinking when the took Steve Perry off of the second Aliens Vs Predator novel?!? After bungling Aliens: Genocide, Bischoff seems like a bad choice, and is. His story is ultra slow, the characters dull and uninteresting, and their is next to no Alien action. Fifty Predheads against twenty cyberaliens, and just winning? Come on. Bring back Perry ... Please!!!!"
2,Comment:,The only thing about AVP:Hunters Planet that is better than AVP:Prey is the cover illustration.
3,Alternate Dimensions,"I hope the Perrys find the guy who wrote Hunters Planet and challenge him to a Duel of the Claws. #1 the queen capture mission is told two different ways #2 Naguchi kills Shorty TWICE. actually if you want to get into specifics she only kills him once (the other with the help of her synthetic counterpart). After reading Prey, Hunters Planet, and War, in that order I found myself waiting for Naguchi to wake up like it was all a flashback dream. To my dissapointment i got to page 210 which was the next page over after AVP: WAR was ended."
1,Worked until fan burned out,"I used it for A/C in the summer, and it worked fine for about a year, then the fan burned out."
4,Will this work for me?,"This is a great solution for certain applications. If your system has a short duty cycle and/or the register you intend to boost takes most of the ""on time"" to change its air temperature, you probably won't see much benefit. Otherwise, this product is the simpliest, safest and most energy efficent solution. I have two - one in a location yielding moderate benefit; and one where benefit is bearly noticable."
2,Waste of Money,"Cons:-First of all, it is too loud. You certainly do not want this on your bedroom.-The difference in temperature is almost negligible-Expensive-It does not look appealing at all. Cheap plastic and construction-You need to have a power outlet close to your registerPros:"
2,noisy and not much volume,"I got much better results putting a portable house fan above the floor grill. I bought it to boost the heating and cooling capabilities. This fan is loud and has a slight electrical/plastic smell when used.Not worth the time and money for us. I'm donating it to goodwill, since it is just taking up space in the house as added clutter."
4,it works for me,"Based on the other reviews, it sounds as though the EQ2 works for some people and doesn't for others depending on their individual room and HVAC configurations. I have an upstairs room with a vaulted ceiling that is 10 degrees Fahrenheit hotter or colder than the rest of the house. The room is more than 200 sq. ft., has only one vent, and is the farthest from the blower. I've had my EQ2 now for 3 years and it is still working fine. The EQ2 brings the temperature difference down to about 4 degrees, which is livable. I tried out the AirFlow Breeze that has 2 DC fans in it but it didn't work as well as the EQ2."
4,Register booster does what it says,I bought two register boosters several years ago and one of the two recently stopped working; could not be repaired by my engineer husband. No longer carried at local store so I ordered two online. We use them on the second floor of our home to boost heat in the winter and A/C in the summer and they work very well. Hope neither of the new ones ordered via Amazon fail!
5,Works Well! Increases AC/Heat efficiency!,"During the summer months, the upstairs rooms in our house are considerably warmer than the ground level and basement. Using the Suncourt 'Register Booster' in combination with opening/closing certain registers, has helped us achieve a more balanced and uniform cooling and heating between all levels of our home. This is truly a great product that costs pennies a day to run, and that gives you a more than ample return in increased comfort level and even a bit of savings on your monthly bill. I have 2 upstairs, and they are a godsend."
2,Not for Heating,"This product might be good for air conditioning but it does not work for heating. I have two rooms on the north end of my house that are always cold. I closed 3 vents in other rooms and installed this booster and it didn't help at all. In fact, it may have made the room colder because it was blocking the air that normally comes out of the vent. The only reason I gave it two stars is because it arrived within 2 days, but now I am returning it."
3,Works but not that great,"We bought this for our son who recently moved into his first apartment in college. The appartment is air conditioned but his room is on the second floor of the unit, and the vent in his room had very low air flow. He reported that the product worked but did not significantly lower the temperature of his room. Given the price, I would say it was worth it. We will see if it is effective this coming winter, although the layout of his unit minimizes the significance of his vent with respect to heating."
1,Fan Does Not Cycle,I recently bought the Suncourt HC300 register booster fan and it does not automatically cycle with heat flow.
2,doesn't cycle,I was unable to get the equalizer to cycle automatically as advertised. It runs constantly so I have to unplug it.
2,Worked for a while; then the fan broke,"We have (had) two of these to bring the heat from the wood stove in the basement up through the vents faster. Just yesterday, the fan for the one upstairs split in half. It worked pretty well up to that point, though it was a bit louder than I would have liked (though that just became white noise after a few minutes)."
1,Motor failed after 4 months,"The motor completely froze,then started and stopped and whirred up and down, then froze again. I've never expected to get more than a few years out of this type of product but 4 months only is a concern. I received a full refund but I'd rather have a product that works."
3,Forced Hot Air Vent Booster Fan,"This is the second one I have owned the first one died after 3 years. I then bought another brand but it was cheaply made and broke in one year. So, I bought this brand and model again. It works well but is very noisey and a little clunky since it lies on top of the forced air heating vent rather than sitting neatly inside of it. In the end it is the only good to average performer I can find."
1,FEED UP WITH RIPOFFS,"AGAIN NO THOUGHT BEHIND THIS RELEASE OF CD IT EXACT SAME CD AS BIG ONES MINUS WALK ON WATER ,BLIND MAN ,AND EAT THE RICH SHOULD USE NEWER MATERIAL PAST GET A GRIP ALBUM IM I DIE HARD AEROSMITH FAN BUT THIS IS JUST PLAN REDUNDENT."
1,"The Rod, unfortunately, is not the fleshy kind","Being a small town girl, from the South, no less, I was expecting the titular ROD to be that wonderful object only males have. Unfortunately, the rod in question is a more pain-inflicting device. I guess I'm just not that kind of girl to be interested in lots of spanking. Mom and Dad made me mad when they tried it so I just don't get off on it now.Even if I were that kind of girl, the ""letters"" to the maid's cousin are generally boring and even if i could work up some excitement over dominance or sadism, there's simply no climactic ""aahhhh"" to wrap up any of the experiences.This is my first Blue Moon book and I almot gave them up, but I will keep searching for titillation."
1,Never got the book,"I never got a chance to see the book. It was damaged, sent back and they refunded my money .... so I never got to see the book that I was so excited about. I'll have to reorder."
2,It's Okay,"I like this book but I'm glad I borrowed it before purchasing. After looking at it, there are only two quilt patterns that I found interesting and I'm only going to make one. So I saved some money. But if you're just starting out with quilting and want a less traditional path, this book might be for you. The instructions are good, the measurements are in metric and American, the photos are decent and the author has a great color sense."
2,not what I thought it was,This book is full of quilts made from alternate materials - I was looking for some more modern patterns in *cottons* so they would be washable and more usable. I'm not going to shell out a few hundred bucks for drycleaning these special materials. They are pretty but not as functional as I was looking for. I sent it back.
1,SNOW WHITE: HAPPILY EVER AFTER FAIRY TALES FOR EVERY CHILD,THIS WAS NOT THE SNOW WHITE WE WE'RE WANTING.THIS IS ABOUT AN INDIAN NAMED WHITE SNOW!!EVEN MY 3 YR. OLD GRAND-DAUGHTER CAME TO HER MOMMY & SAID SOMETHING WAS FUNNY (DIFFERENT) ABOUT SNOW WHITE.MY DAUGHTER SAID SHE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHEN THEN PACKAGE WAS YELLOWING LIKE IT HAD BEEN ON THE SHELF FOR A LONG TIME.THEY WE'RE BOTH VERY DISAPPOINTED & WE WANT TO RETURN IT.
3,"Good, but not her best","I stopped reading this book twice, before I finally finished it. I really liked the characters, especially Nicolas, but the storyline lagged a little."
5,Explosive read.,"I thought this book was really good. I have not read the first one in this series yet, but its coming in the mail any day now. I am a fan of her Dark series as well and I think this series will be just as good. Its a nice change from all the Dark books, but it still has her flare. I thought it was great and I cant wait for the rest of the books. Its a nice cahnge of pace with the men just as hot! Highly recommended."
4,A good read,This was a page tuner for me. Dahlia was very brave while also being very stubborn. Nico had that quiet determination. cannot wait to read the next book.
5,I love this series!!,"I couldn't put this book down! From start to finish, I was sucked into the story, action and excitement!!! I MUST read, along with the rest of the series... Enjoy!"
2,NOT IMPRESSED,"I am a big fan of Christine Feehan's ""Dark Series"" and I have tried her other works. I won't bore you with the book description, because you can read that already. I will say that this story could have been told in 100 pages instead of being dragged out into 300 plus pages. I'm going to stick to her ""Dark Series"". She's good at that!"
4,Good read from the Ghostwalker Series,I am a huge fan of Christine Feehan. This is a good second installment in the series. Can't wait for Gator's story.
3,I never knew I was a prude!,"I picked up the book after looking at the back cover. I had no idea it was a romance novel... silly me!! Wow... was I ever shocked!! I guess it could be argued that the steamy scenes were relevant to the story, but I have to admit that it was hard for me to get through them... and obviously, I cannot recommend to my kids or friends. This is a shame, cuz the basic storyline was pretty cool. Maybe she could come up with a PG version??? :)I would have given it five stars, but.... turns out, I'm a prude. Someone let me know if she has a series without the hot steamy vocabulary laden sex scenes!! I might give it a try.Jay"
3,Everts Air Douglas DC-6,"Many of Everts C-118's are ex USN and USAF, some of which I flew while on active duty with the Navy. This DVD brings back a lot of memories. The price is a bit steep, but the content is nearly impossible to find elsewhere these days. The video and audio are typical for operations of this type aircraft. It's shot in Alaska, and there's lots of interesting footage, but we're not talking PBS quality here. Good, but not great."
2,not Jr,"Bought, hoping it was by Jr. T'wasn't, t'were by his Dad, a 'Faith' teacher. Good for what it was, would recommend it for anyone wanting to be encouraged to use their faith."
1,lose it or lose it,Ive been in a word of faith for many years the book i feel put to much n us as i feel with the word of faith we now attend a born again lurthan church over all plus the book god gave us grace i wheres the LOVE I JUST DONT SEE IF THER FAITH IS SO GOOD THEN THERE LOVE SHOULD BE WELL KNOWN THE BOOK IS TO SIMPLE GOOD FOR THE STROUNG BY THE WEAK AND POOR WOULD LOSE OUT GOD LOVE IS TO GREAT TO GIVR AND TAKE BUT HE HELPSS LEAD AND STEARS US SOME TIMES IT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK SOMETHING BACK BECAUSE AT THE TIME HES CARRING WORD OF FAITH IS A SIMLE DOCRINE SHOULD BE WORD OF LOVE THE BOOK THE BOOK USE IT OR LOSE IT SHOULD BECALLED USE IT AND GODS GRACEWILL TAKE YOU DEEPER IN WORKABLE LOVE.

4,"Very Nice Globe, No Book and a ""Replogle"" Product","I am happy with my purchase, but I did not get a book with it (another reviewer mentioned a book). It was very easy to put together and has a nice wood base. From the description, I thought it was from a different company than Replogle, but it is not. This is a Replogle 12 inch diameter globe, World Classic Series....don't know where ""Hastings English World Globe"" comes from (it doesn't say this on the globe). It is stamped ""Made in the USA and Kevin M. Dzurny, Cartographer"""
5,Beautiful!,"We bought this globe after reading all of the reviews and were not dissapointed. The base is solid and the workmanship is precise. We are not ""Globe Experts"" and the book that came along with the globe has been very informative and helpful as we've spent time with it. It is now an attractive addition to our office and has been used more than we ever thought it would be."
1,SHAMEFULLY BAD.,"""Power 98"" is a so-called thriller that is painfully generic. Eric Roberts plays a shock jock in LA who has his own successful talk radio show. He ups the ante by starting a program where callers call in to tell listeners about crimes they have committed. A caller claims to have committed a murder. Did he really? Who is he? Does anybody really care??? Jason Gedrick gives such an awful performance as Roberts' sidekick that you'll spend most of the movie wishing he would be killed. One last thing...Jennie Garth is all but ignored in this film. Her scenes are few and far between. Am I the only one who thinks she is a talented actress and should be given a real shot in the movies? Just wondering. Anyway, stay away from this drivel at all cost."
1,Ordered by mistake,"The part was ordered by mistake. I did not realize that 1-click was on. I sent the part back and have not had any response from BIGFLYSPORTS. This does not seem to the way you would like to do business. I was satisfied with past orders from AMAZON.COM. Thanks for your ear.Raoul J. Laurent, Jr. HTC USN RET."
2,"Beautiful book, but full of errors","Oxford University Press has published a visually spectacular and comprehensive astronomy encyclopedia for the lay-person. They have made liberal use of recent Hubble Space Telescope images to produce a truly beautiful book. However, the number of errors ranging from mistaken numbers, to misattributed photographs, to confused sentences is surprising. Perhaps a second edition will clean up these problems."
4,Great Music once you find the right track!,"Excellent imaging and sound quality on all tracks. HOWEVER, the Amazon listing, the CD case, and the CD all list 17 tracks. Your player may only show 13. This is also correct. IF you look at the grouping on the CD case, you will see Tracks 1&2 are grouped. So are tracks 5,6,7&8. With this in mind, all tracks are in order, but what your player shows as track 2 is 3 on the CD. What shows as track 4 is actually tracks 5-8, and everything from there on out is fine, just 4 numbers behind: Track 9 will show up as 5, 10 as 6, etc. So if you want to hear the Hallelujah Chorus, go to track 7, not track 11.It is a great sounding set of Highlights for those who want that kind of album, and if your rip it, you only have to correct your catalog listing once. It just would be nice if this had been mentioned on the Telarc notes!"
4,Robert Shaw and Atlanta's Magnificent Chorus,A nice collection of inspiring choral classics. Richly orchestrated and sung with heart and energy. Highly recommended for the opera buff and spiritually enlightened.
2,What a great collection for beginners!,It has so many great Choruses from so many great composers - a must forfirst time listeners to the great classics.
4,Music Fan From Cape Cod,"""After hearing Shana in a club in San Francisco,(1998) I bought the CD, Caledonia that night from Shana herself! When I arrived home I ordered more for friends....they went wild when they heard her voice. Shana's voice is different. Sort of like Janis Joplin, Bonnie Raitt, and Alanis Morrisette, but not quite, her voice is unique. No one else sounds quite like Shana Morrison. She can belt out the blues, swing into country, cruise up to rock, and sing haunting melodies without missing a beat. Favorite tracks are, ""I Spy"", ""Can't Hold On,"" ""Mile 14"",""Gladys"" and of course her knock out rendition of her Dad's ""Sweet Thing."" Shana Morrison is a talent to be reckoned with - one of the best new voices in music today."""
4,sweet thing,I have heard many young singers starting out in my many years of listinging to records and oh yes C.D. I feel this young lady has a great fucture in the buiness.and IO feel this record is one the best First attempt I have heard in a long time.If I see here again I hope to tell here to keep up the good work.and I believe this is just a start of a long life of many good recording
5,Shana Morrison Caledonia,"I saw Shana Morrison and Roy Rogers play together during the summer of 2000. I am a huge van morrison fan so i was excited to see Shana. I was so impressed with that concert. She only played one Van Morrison song which was ""Sweet Thing"" and it brought me to tears. I was thinking her dad probably wrote the song for her. Anyway, this CD is impressive. Shana has a beautiful voice and interesting range of songs."
1,Dreadful Sound Engineering,"Such beautiful Verdi and tis a shame to have to fiddle with the volume control on every single track (and even within the track). One will be inaudible, the next will blare."
3,not very emotionally involving interpretation,It looks like Decca's re-release of part of an earlier 4CD set that can be found here:Bach: Complete Keyboard Concertosthat I reviewed there already.
1,"case, leapster, soft","I read that this case would hold the Leapster. That is true, but it is a very tight fit. If you have a version of the leapster with the front cover, the fit is very tight and you cannot store any cartridges or it will not close. Also, even without the cover, the fit is tight and very hard for my youngest (3 1/2) to close so he doesn't ever put his Leapster back in it when he is finished playing. It is also a soft case and doesn't provide much protection other than from screen scratches or ""light"" damage. The Leapster soft backpack is more roomy and you can store the game plus many cartridges without issue!"
5,reading order,"I absolutely love this book series! Once I pick one up I can't put it down. Just finished the 4th book (Kalahari typing school for men) and got confused at the end. Usually at the end of the books there is the first chapter of the next one in the series but Kalahari'... didn't have one. also, just picked up the next one 'full cupboard of life' and it says at the end that the next book is 'blue shoes and happiness' and has the first chapter of it at the end. In the number order and also printed inside the front cover it says the next book (no.6) is 'in the company of cheerful ladies' I'm guessing this is just a printing mistake and will read them in number order. Abacus might want to look at it though. Anyway, it wont put me off! I hope I never run out of these books! I'm really happy as I thought there were only 8 books but have just discovered there are a few written since."
5,No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency,"Great series of books. Quick read, interesting setting and characters.Looking forward to reading the additional books in the series."
5,Fantastic series-can't wait to buy the rest,"I started watching this series on HBO and loved the common sense approach of the owner of this unique business, information about the country, etc. I decided to buy the first set of this series as I have discovered that if I love the HBO series, usually the books are even better such as the Sookie Stackhouse series. I was right!I loved the books and cannot wait to finish them and order the rest of the books. They are well written, very enjoyable, and have an interesting, unique perspective on how to help persons with their problems!"
5,Nice,This unit works geat in a small space.Good unit for smaller bedrooms ect. Just what I was looking for!!Recommend to anyone.
4,"good, but not great.","This is a pretty album, it just lacks that very full sound that SOB I and II had. However, I like it a little more every time I listen to it."
4,Comparisons to the original don't do it justice,"I was certainly disappointed when I first listened to SOB2K, because I too had been wanting to get ahold of the original SOB since I lost the tape years ago. But now that Switched-On Boxed is out, I'm no longer trying to find a substitute for the original, and SOB2K stands up well in its own right. No, I don't agree with all of Carlos' new orchestration. The loss of a big fat bass sound on ""Air on a G String"" is particularly unfortunate, and some of the bell-like tones (especially in the Toccatta & Fugue) are downright annoying. But these are minor problems that don't ruin the recording as a whole. Simply put, SOB2K is to FM & PCM synthesis what SOB was to modular synthesis. That the sounds are similar to what you'll find on cheap mass-produced keyboards is more a testament to the ubiquity of the technology than a criticism of Carlos' programming."
2,Not as good as the first.,Too bad the first is no longer in print. Very disappointing.I am looking for a copy of the first one. I grew up listening to SOB on 8-track and now all I can get is this one.
2,Not like SOB I or II,"SOB 2000 just doesn't make it. It's flat and soft, having lost the edge of SOB I and II. I have SOB I on CD. Anybody seen SOB II? I have II on vinyl."
2,Disappointly Eccentric,"Having ""cut my Classical teeth"" on the original Switched On Bach back in the 70s, I was looking forward to this ""Next Generation"" work by Carlos. In a time in our lives when so many things keep getting better and better with the assistance of computers; I'm saddened to say that I was truly disappointed in this work. I found that his musical ""packaging"" really got in the way of the music. The music so well composed was trampled in a busy frenzy of emotions. The music I so loved was used as a ""carrier"" for some distorted message. I'm sorry to say that I can not recommend this CD for pleasurable listening."
2,Let down from the original,Switched On Bach 2000 is to the original what Bill Clinton is to A. Lincon. Sounds good at first but no depth.
1,Listen to the real Bach,This cd and all of the cd's of this kind are not true classics. If you like Bach you should listen to the orchestra version. These songs do not do justice to the real music. Classical music is not meant to be modern.
3,"Well done, yet nothing special","I am a big fan of Carlos' work, not just the Moog era but her later recordings. This is ""okay"", but in my opinion just not the ""fantastic"" level of some of her other recordings.I enjoy the disc, and it's permanently in my library. But I don't play it very much. I think in some ways it's a product of its era; the ""Telarc: Warning, extreme Digital sound!"" period of CD production. It seems to have aged less well than the Moog performances."
2,Throw This One Bach,"As someone who has been a Carlos fan from the very beginning, I honestly would have to dissuade potential buyers from plunking down any cash for this very uninspired album. It is enough to make you wish MIDI had never been invented. Most of the voices sound like the same canned stuff you get on any keyboard from K-Mart, with the addition of some very annoying tuning. I get the feeling this recording was dashed off in a matter of weeks (that's what it sounds like, anyway). Pass this one by and get the CD version of the original S.O.B., which has lost none of its freshness, originality and musicality in over 30 years!"
3,Interesting,"This is interesting from a historical perspective. It's not Mozart's greatest work, when compared to his operas,symphonies, and even much of his chamber music.I had bought this originally thinking of incorporating it into my own Lodge's ceremonies. However I just don't see it happening--most of the work features vocalists in foreign text, which just won't go over well here. When I bought it I was assuming it would be more instrumental in nature.Final word: It is interesting for Masonic scholars and Mozart completists, but it's nothing that you'll be humming the next day."
5,tasty and convenient,"I agree with reviews that state the texture is closer to a pancake than a hamburger bun, but ultimately the important thing is, how does it taste? And secondly, does it fall apart or can you actually eat a burger with it? The flavor is similar to white bread buns with a bit of sweetness, and it holds together beautifully through the sloppiest hamburger. Tasty!"
5,My son loves these,My son absolutely loves these buns. He asks for tham all the time. They are a bit pricey but great for traveling or when short on time.
1,"Unfortunately, these were not good.","These were a real disappointment. After trying their Minute Coffee Cake and loving it, I had high expectations. The hamburger buns were tough, and then turned hard as a brick. They were awful, and we ended up throwing them away. A real bummer....a great cheeseburger on a bun is the thing I miss most being a celiac! Do try their Coffee Cake, though. It was fantastic, and you only add water and microwave for a minute! Feels like cheating in the morning, and perfect for those in a rush. Be sure and don't throw the baking container away, as it looks like you can order just the refills without the container for less money."
1,Terrible - Don't Bother,"I decided to try these after reading the one good review. These pseudo hamburger buns are a tastless, colorless, spongy textured fake food. Even my dog wouldn't eat it. Don't waste your money."
4,Great cutters!,"These are so much fun! I love coming up with different designs with colored frosting.I was hoping they were gonna be bigger, but works out cause then you can have a couple cookies with a cup of coffee. :) I have been hand washing them only because I don't know what the dishwasher would do. But I would recommend these to anyone."
2,Picture.,"Picture. Words of little use. How can few words describe a hundred years of patients.And if you needed pictures, then this book is a pricey source for the ordinary"
5,Super chill album,"Underground hip-hop doesn't get much better than this. Two of Legends best come together to put out some clean beats and lyrics. If you are into The Grouch, Eligh, or just underground hip-hop in general, pick up this album now. One of my favorite albums."
5,Jewish Cello Masterpieces album,"This is a wonderful album. The music is beautiful. The musicianship is marvelous. Ernest Bloch is one of my favorite composers. His piece, Prayer, is a very moving piece of music as is the rest of the album."
3,It has it's moments but.....,"First of all how many versions of an album needs to come out. I was looking for my version (digipak which has 4 bonus tracks, no DVD) to do my review but I see numerous other versions so this one will have to do. There are some weak points on the album and some songs shouldn't be on here. I don't think Edguy will ever be able to top ""Theater of Salvation"". The tracks that didn't impress me were Catch of the Century, Asylum, Save Me, Trindad and F.... with Fire (Hair Force One). The other Tracks are pretty good. I liked the album more on my second listen than I did on my first but I have a bad feeling on the direction that this band is going and hopefully I'm not right."
5,Their best album yet,"I own all Edguy's full length albums except Savage Poetry (just ordered it) and this is without a doubt the best one. This and Hellfire Club is a far cry from their earlier rock opera work, but it's still great. I honestly can't say any particular song is a filler piece. Edguys last two albums bring metal back to its glory days with an obvious inspiration by Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Poison, ACDC, and Stratovarius. If you liked any of the aforementioned bands, get this CD now."
5,The best,"this is the best album i've bought in a long long time. it stayed in my stereo for a long time and i still didn't get tired of it. if you like metal and 80's hair bands you will love this album. i got turned on to this band with hellfires club and it is also awesome. RR is a little more upbeat and i can say i love every song. i just can't say enough about this band and i would love for them to have a major tour through the USA along with say Hammerfall. that would be a killer show. this is a must have cd along with HC. i promise you won't be disappointed. i go way back to the beginning of maiden, scorps, priest and i'm still rockin."
4,Very Detailed,This is a very detailed textbook. If you want to learn about Geology in great detail this is the book for you. I recently learned that a new version will be coming out soon. I know this because my university will not buy the book back since the new edition will replace this edition next semester. If you plan on buying this book wait because the price will go down as soon as the new edition comes out.
5,One of the better actionscript books,"This is an excellent actionscript book for designers (beginners) who don't like geeky terminology. It leads the reader slowly and the layout is very organized. After you read this book, you'll surely become a well-rounded actionscripter. Compared to other books like Peachpit Actionscript, this book is much better."
3,Too much and too little,"There is a reason why this book is big. Too much time is spent to explain small things. A reader can easily get lost in the details or lose any interest. ActionScript is best taught by using the object-oriented programming paradigm. Little effort is done in this direction. The programming style is not poor, but not brilliant either. It is also a dull book, in spite of the imaginative chapter titles. With so many other better books in the market, only a naive reader would actually choose this one."
3,totally disappointed..,"i got the ""Foundation of flash mx"" like two months ago and i learned alot from it. Therefore i got Foundation Actionscript for flash mx. Unfortunately, this time i am totally disappointed. First of all, The contents are so unorganized. It doesn't provide the glossy of actionscript terms or something like that. The introduction is poor written. They could suddenly introduce to the reader so many new ""actions"" and ""terms"" at once, and they don't really explain them in detail. Newbies would get confused easily. The amount of tutorials are also reduced and most of them are 6-7 pages long. This book is not bad, but not a really good ""introduction"" book for Actionscript."
4,An Eclectic Christmas Collection,"Boston's Empire Brass' Christmas Album THE WORLD SINGS is an interesting mix of Christmas music. Listeners certainly will find Empire's polished and powerful sound in many of the tracks. While the group is a classically trained brass quintet, there are tracks that include contemporary musicians as well as a vocalist Laurie Monahan. The album includes many Christmas standards such as ""Joy to the World,"" ""Angels We Have Heard On High"" and the like. Less familiar carols are included such as ""Pat-a-pan"" and ""Still, Still, Still."" A personal favorite is the group's unique rendition of the ""Arabian Dance"" from THE NUTCRACKER. People desiring a traditional brass quintet album will probably be better off looking at the Philadelphia Brass Ensembles A FESTIVAL OF CAROLS IN BRASS (a must have for all lovers of brass music), but listeners who enjoy creative sound rooted in classical music but open to contemporary music will certainly enjoy this wonderful collection."
5,Unique,"I always collect unique Christmas albums. Where someone gives an old familiar carol a new, fresh spin. There are quite a few to choose from on this album.I really enjoy ""O Come All Ye Faithful,"" with its steady crescendo and addition of instruments. ""The Little Drummer Boy"" is similar, starting with a soloist.""Oh! G,"" a montage of several Christmas carols is manic, fun, and really enjoyable. The tuba player is practically a virtuoso!All in all, a very nice refreshing change of style."
4,sounds good to me,"I saw them in concert at the national art gallery in DC for the Christmas holiday and wanted to get a cd. they did not record that concert, and I wish they had, it was very very good, the best. so, getting the cd was good, not as good as the concert, but still good. great brass sounds, some singing.a song or two have very quiet starts, so listening in my car while driving I wonder where's the music?"
2,Not a Keeper,"This recording is not for anyone who prefers traditional Christmas music done in the way the composers intended. Empire Brass and friends have taken serious liberties on every track. Most disappointing was the sinuous Arabian Dance shattered by dynamics that produce cringes rather than sighs of pleasure. If you like jazz riffs, drum solos, and electric guitar sounds, then by all means explore this unusual recording. Otherwise, you might be better advised to spend your money elsewhere."
1,White Elephant Status,"Congratulations Empire Brass, this CD will be given away as a white elephant present to some poor, unsuspecting friend this Christmas.I was expecting brass and also tasteful. Instead I was assualted by obnoxious electric guitar and Stompesque percussion. Too much singing too, even if done more tastefully than the guitar and percussion. Some songs were so bad that I couldn't even finish them before skipping to the next track."
2,Humbug,"A disagreeable disc that highlights the Empire Brass' less desirable features. The technical brilliance is undeniable. However, the arrangements are annoying and detract from the subject at hand. Just play the music and let it speak for itself!"
4,A good sampling of cuts by Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops,"The recordings on this CD span several years in Kunzel's work with the Cincinnati Pops. The recording quality is first rate. The CD opens with a cut called ""The Sounds of the West"" complete with western sound effects. The mooing cows and whinnying horses were so real that our dog made a bee-line to the speakers on my system. The selection is varied enough to provide something of interest to about any listener."
3,Not Bad Just Average,This is not a bad CD but I thought the selections could have been better. I think you are better off buying the source CDs. Erich Kunzel's output is substantial. Most of Kunzel's CDs follow a particular theme or follow a genre when it comes to film scores. I think you are better off to go with the type of music that you generally like instead of this potpourri. You usually can't go wrong with any of Erich Kunzel's recordings.
5,Harmony and gospel @ its BEST!,"I heard ""Too Many Troubles"" on the radio and had to hear more! Their harmony is rich; but their rhythm is unhurried and impeccable. The lyrics are simple and believable - not over the top w/ religion. The pieces are diverse and each is enjoyable in its own right. Nothing compares to black gospel. Thank goodness for the Dixie Hummingbirds!"
2,Hole in the top not waterproof,"The cover appears to be made of a tough material but it has a hole in the top. I assume this is for an umbrella. I wish the image/description of the cover would have clearly depicted this as a waterproof layer was the main reason for this purchase. I used a zip tie to close the hole and that appears to work, though not the most elegant choice. I will attempt to reverse it so that it is not visible. Luckily I only purchased one of these I needed to buy at least two. I will look for a more appropriate waterproof layer in my next purchase."
4,Great prog metal,Great progressive music with major goth influence. Beautiful melancholic melodies.It's good to know that Israel can make progressive music.Highly recommended.
4,So far a 14 year old reader,"I am only on chapter 16 of this book but so far I must say that it is very enjoyable. I just started reading it but once I read it I could not put it down. There are some dull points to the story however such as when the author goes on for a page about Gilli's eating habbits. The book is very detailed and though it doesn't have much in the line of action, it is some how still addictive with it's suspence. If you enjoy stories about long ago when many people were thought to be witches then you will most certainly enjoy this colorful tale of witch trails, lies, and suspence."
3,Which witch and whose who,"I liked that this was a fictional story about a non-fictional topic. It tells you about a time in history and the events that happened. It was true that they hung people but the names of the people they hung in the book are made up. I disliked that there were so many names. It made it hard to tell who was who. In the book someone's first name was the same as someone elses last name. This book is similar to the book Farewell to Manizar because in both books people are unjustly accused of things they didn't do and persecuted for them. Overall I thought the book was O.K., it could have had a little more detail about the surroundings."
2,I found this book slightly dull.....,"Perhaps I found this book dull and not very interesting because I already knew the ending from studying the Salem Trials before reading this book. I already knew what was truly happening and why before the book was even a quarter of the way through. Another thing I found was that to me this book seemed below my reading level since it was actually a book required for us to read for our highschool English class. If you are used to reading high level books and are thinking on buying this book for summer reading, please don't."
1,Different,"Beyond the Burning Time by Kathryn Lasky was a book about Salem Village in 1692. I found this book confusing and dull. It lacked detail and points of interest. It seemed to drag on and just when you thought the end was near the author would introduce something else. Part of the reason I didn't enjoy the book is I don't believe in witch craft and the author didn't do anything to convince me otherwise.This was a good thinking book. It made me think about gossip and the effects it has on people and how hard it would be to have been accused of being a witch with out evidence.This is a book I would recommend to people who enjoy suspense ,mystery and historical fiction. It was not easy reading so I would recommend it for people grades 7-12. I prefer a book with more action and real life experiences that I can relate to."
2,Was very...confusing...,"Warning:Do not read this if you have a tendency to become depressed.Beyond the Burning Time proves to be a deathly novel. The author, instead of explaining things in normal form, used such murderous words to describe everything. There are still some parts of the book that disturb me to this day. It was even revolting at times. But hey, witch trials are great! Mary, on the other hand, was a different story. She wasn't explained in a deathly manner. She wasn't explained at all. She had not one feeling that I could see. Once in a while the author would throw in some wanna-be poetic comment that she probably thought would discribe Mary, but it only resulted in being cheap, and totally irrelevant to the whole novel, since it was so far from being poetic. Anyway, the only thing I have to say is that from what I read, the author tried too hard to be...something...and ended up very murderous."
1,Boring and stupid,"I thought this book was the stupidest book I have ever read in my whole life. It was so pointless to read about this because it's not happening now, so who cares?"
4,Beyond the Burning Time,"Beyond the Burning time takes place in Salem, Massachusetts, where the witch trials are occurring. The story is told through the eyes of Mary Chase, a fifteen year-old-girl. The leaders of Salem are accusing townsfolk of witchcraft, a crime punishable by death. Mary's mother, Virginia Chase is accused. Mary and her brother, Caleb must find a way to rescue their mother from prison before she is executed. Can they do it? Is there enough time.This is an interesting and well-written book, although mass numbers of characters and frequent event changes were sometimes hard to follow. The book accurately recreates the Salem Witch trials. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially those interested in the time period. The setting was intriguing; it made for a good read."
4,A very interesting book,"Beyond the Burning Time is a great book. This historicalfiction is not only educational, but it is very interesting. Beyondthe Burning Time is a book about the Salem Witch Trials. As most people know, the Salem Witch Trials took place in the late 1600's. To be more precise, they took place in the year of 1692. It tells a story about a girl named Mary Chase who watches all the horrible things going on in her once quiet town. All of the ""afflicted"" girls cause many people to be hanged because they are accused of witch craft. All of the afflicted girls are Mary's age, and she wonders and worries all of the nasty seizures that the afflicted girls have will happen to her. Then, when her mother becomes of witch craft, Mary and her brother Caleb have to try to put an end to all these deaths. Can they save their mother in time, or are they too late? Well, you will just have to read this book to find out. I'm sure you will enjoy this book."
3,Boogie Review,"Beyond The Burning Time is an exciting book on the lives of two women trying to escape the madness of Salem in the late 1600's. When Anne Puttman, a young girl, claimed to be possessed, chaos spread through the town of Salem, as innocent people were killed and arrested for witchcraft. Mary didn't really know at first if the first people accused were innocent. As time went on Mary grew suspicious of Anne but found out that people were accused that couldn't possibly be witches. When Mary's mother was accused of witchcraft, Mary and her brother Caleb make an attempt to rescue her.This novel is original and unique from most books that I have read because of the history and fiction that brings the book together. My opinion of the book was changed and was even better when I learned similar things happened in the past. I recommend this book for all ages able to read the book. They would learn of the tragedies and adventures of Salem that really showed how evil and greedy the world can be."
3,Gorgeous,"There are some drop dead beautiful scenes of the Bad Lands. There are some great old time photographs of the cowboys, local folk and animals. There are some interesting nuggets of information about Theodore Roosevelt. There are also some scenes and themes that are used over and over and over and over. I found I was checking the remaining time often and thinking it should have been shorter."
5,Very good!!,It's been very helpful for me. I have a test tomorrow and I hope I pass cause I have been studying so hard on this book. This book has helped me a lot and I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to buy it. Thank you!!
3,Needs more worksheets,"This workbook would be much better if it had more worksheets for each lesson. It would also be helpful if the was a section that had the rules listed so your student could refer to the ""rule sheet"" instead of having to thumb through the entire book. I use this as a supplememnt for the larger GED book."
1,Writing too cluttered. No easy reading.,"I found the book too wordy, had to decipher and go over most of the writing. I love easy reading history books. Too political, not much detail of his deeds or personal life. I was not pleased with this book. I got tired of reading it."
5,GOOD QUALITY,This item sells in stores for a higher price and is not easy to find a store that carries this size or that keeps it in stock.
3,"Fair cutting performance,a little over priced.","Have used Oregon in the past, these particular chains don't cut very well. If your looking for a performance chain look elsewhere."
1,disappointed,"This book would have been better titled ""Dips"" as it has more recipes for dips to use after you make a fondue than the fondue itself. It does discuss fondues, very briefly, but it didn't tell me anything I didn't already know and it didn't answer the questions I needed answered. If you aren't already well acquainted with making fondues this book will be of little help."
4,Good for Hot Pot Too,"This book has served me well for both fondue and Mongolian hot pot meals. I would agree that it isn't a book for beginners, as you have to improvise a bit to get exactly what you want. . . but it is good for providing a jumping off point. For those who like to cook meats in broth instead of oil, the book has several simple and tasty recipes for dipping sauces spread throughout the book."
3,Better title would be dips,I was looking for a more traditional fondue cook book and this was not it. It would have been better titled dips. I was very dissapointed. There were more dips rather than true fondue type cooking. Additionally there was very little in the way of directions or clrification. There were lovely pictures though.
2,"Don't buy, not too informative","This book does have alot of different dips, but not much info on how to have a fondue ""party"". It doesn't explain in detail the equipment you need or how to set everything up. The only good thing about the book is that there are lots of pictures for preparation and presentation of the dips."
3,RavPhone,I had ordered the phone in Pink. When i got the phone it was the wrong color it was in red. I was alittle upset cause i paid extra for the rush delivery and it didn't arrive when it was suppose to. Unable to return or exchange it cause I needed a phone asap and my heart was set on that brand phone and color. So I am not a happy customer.
2,OK better Renditions out there,Its pretty stock and The brass is a little weak except for some spots in the 4th but overall not to impressed by this reording.
1,Did incredible damage to the series,"Destiny's Way essentially killed the New Jedi Order series. In addition to being one of the only Star Wars books I have read that is actually poorly written, it essentially destroyed all the character development that had been gaining over the past several books, most especially in ""Traitor"". The most horrible example of this is Jacen Solo, who is reverted back to the whiny, self-absorbed fool he was at the beginning of the series with no explanation. This book marks the beginning of New Jedi Order's death throes, and, with a little help from the disappointing ""Unifying Force"", tarnishes what could have otherwise been an amazing book series."
3,Rebel scum!,"By the 14th book in the series, everyone should be familiar with the main players. So when Han or Jacen Solo say or do something out of character for no reason, it kind of sticks out like a Wookie in a McDonald's drive-thru. ""Oh, Leia, my darling.""After ""Traitor,"" which was great, I was expecting Jacen to use little more of that ""Vongsense"" and a little less whining. No, but at least he's got that beard, lol.There were several parts in the book that seem contrived, which made things predictable. And you know how in some of the books in the series, they climax is a big battle scene? Predictable right? Well, get ready not to be surprised.Here's hoping ""Force Heretic"" is awesome."
2,Yawn,On...the Author admits to never reading ANY of the previous books except for Traitor and a Star Wars who's who book.It comes in loud and clear while reading the book. Please don't write another Star Wars book if you don't care enough to be consistant. I'm definatly reading part of the next book at the store before buying it.
3,"Boring, but with some bright spots","This book was decent. I'd go as far as to say it had some brilliant passages--Vergere's description of her time on Zonama Sekot was fantastic (the writing style sounded just like Traitor, which I loved), and the entire concept of Alpha Red was both intriguing and terrifying. Unfortunately, I found the book incredibly boring. The writing seemed very rote, the characters were underdeveloped, and the majority of the book was so lacking in dramatic action that I'm not entirely sure what the plot was. Destiny's Way wasn't sickeningly badly written, and the characters weren't horribly mangled--both things I've seen happen before in NJO. Instead, this installment was totally forgettable."
4,"Slow, but finishes strong.","Having read a few of the other reviews. I agree a little that some of the characters behave a little differently in the book. It starts out a little slow, but the end of the book was very good. I do recommend this for those who have read the previous 13 books and plan on reading the rest."
5,Good book!!,Another great Star wars book. It picks up towards the end! I wasn't sure about the whole Vong thing but Williams's book makes it exciting
4,good book,"When it comes to Star Wars book my only criteria for reviewing them is did I enjoy the read. Well, I usually enjoy them and this one was a good as most in this series have been. If you've been reading this series, I think you'll enjoy this book."
3,Disappointed but it is a book truly for Star Wars fans...,As an avid reader of the NJO series I've read many great moments during the series and had many more disappointments. This book is up there with the disappointments. My biggest recommendation for authors coming to the EU is do the research first!The character relationships are totally out of character and sometimes I'm left to wonder where we are going in this book. Jacen's return should have been hailed as a major event to friends and family but is lackluster and didn't the author know about Winter and Tycho's relationship (case in point about doing your research) and it seems we have more talking about safeguarding the galaxy than doing it.With the series seemingly coming to end in 2003 early 2004 I hope all this talk about destiny pays off.
4,"great read, whether or not its worth [the money I spent] ... is another ?","I have found the New Jedi Order series to be an exciting deviation from the nosediving extended universe literature that came after Zahn and Stackpole. Destiny's Way is no exception to the rest of the NJI series. Although I did read this book in less than six hours one afternoon, yet I never put it down. The plot of this series was clearly plotted out in detail by a myriad of authors who divided up the writing tasks and an excellent job they did. The only thing that bothers me is the mentioning of the Yuuzhon Vong in prequal books that take place before the 6 episodes. These seem to eclipse the real Star Wars story and kinda bummed me out as pathetic as that sounds. Anyway, I enjoy a good, well-written read but despice garbage printed for the money they bring. With my basis in mind, I recommend this book to any who dont want to wait till paperback."
2,Speed Bump,"It's unfortunate that this book is part of the largely excellent NJO series, because I can't tell you to skip it! Sure the basic story is good, but that's prescripted to fit into the timelines/plotlines of the series as a whole. Once Williams got to it, the life seems sucked out. The book isn't worthless, it's just nowhere near as engaging and interesting as some of the other books in the series.Most people seem to be criticizing Jacen's characterization - I was personally absolutely appalled by Mara. She seemed very flighty and ditzy compared to the Mara I know and love. Although she doesn't get a lot of ""page"" time in Remnant (Book 15), her treatment was more true to form.My advice: get this one out of the way so you can get on with the good stuff!"
2,"Destiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 14)","Consistency seems to be a major issue in this series. When we last left Jacen he had become a sort of super Jedi whom we expected to do great and marvelous things. Instead he becomes almost a side note in this book and appears to have become a wimp again. Furthermore, one of the characters that had great potential is squandered and killed (you will have to read it I an not going to spoil that) needlessly. Please have these authors read the series before committing to actually writing on it. Maybe then, be more pleasing to the fans. A good read none the less but it had the potential to have been a great one."
3,This guy needs to read more,"Though I haven't finished the book, I can tell right now this the author didn't really research the Star Wars Universe. The way the characters act is totally out of character. He tries to through in these little romantic hints into the Luke/Mara Han/Leia relationships and doesn't pull them off very well. I also get this feeling that he never read any of the other NJO books, but merely consulted the ""script"" for the series. The story isn't too bad, but the attention to detail makes this a tough read for a truly dedicated Star Wars fan. I would constantly have to stop and correct him, which made for a very bumpy read."
2,"Inferior, to be blunt.","I should've read the description more carefully before I ordered it, but don't think words like ""unknown artists"" or ""poor arrangements"" were used. Yes, the numbers were familiar but the renderings were not at all what I expected. A disappointment. And I so love anything Broadway.."
1,This is not really down,"The description is wrong, the coat is filled with polyester, not down as stated. Also the coat looks cheap and ill fitting."
3,nice and warm but not as form fitting as pictured,"Very functional and warm. The hood is a light fabric that is over sized so it goes over pony tails. I wore this jacket to New York and stayed cozy in 34 degree weather.The fit is a bit boxy, unlike the photo. I may replace the jacket eventually for a more stylish and fitting one."
5,"My impression of the Kitaro DVD and CD ""The Essential Kitaro""","The selections of Kitaro music were an excellent representation of the artistic and very talented Kitaro. The DVD was absolutely gorgeous in the photography and images portrayed in tune and synchronization with the lilting music of the great artist, Kitaro."
4,Exceptional English Folk,"This undeservedly obscure album deserves a review! Tickawinda were Jim Schofield, Alison Tulloch, Kath Richmond, and Dave Birchwood. They were the house band for the Rose & Crown folk club in the late 70's. Tickawinda went into the studio in 1979 to make this, their only album, with the help of Clive Gregson. They had obviously listened to Steeleye Span and Pentangle a bit, given their choice of material. The performances of these traditional tunes, and others written by more contemporary song writers, are outstanding. The female volcalists are both wonderful, and the playing on the album is superb. Fans of the afore mentioned bands may want to check this one out."
2,Junk,"Product does not load easily, even if you are using xp pro, sp1. Once working only 20% of the cards entered were completely read, all the others ranged from name only to complete errors on the input. Standard cards were tested with only minimum logos. It would be faster to enter data manually.Sorry but I would recommend attempting another product, not this one."
4,Worked for me...,"Yes, it is not 100% accurate. Will need to do some light editing, but definitely better than entering by hand..."
4,A Worthy Sequel to the Original,"William Powell and Myrna Loy are Nick and Nora Charles again. At the end of ""The Thin Man,"" they were on a train on their way to San Francisco, where her rich and insufferable family lives. So we pick up right where we left off.One other familiar face in this one, too, not counting a few character actors you may recognize. James Stewart plays David Graham, who is in love with Nora's cousin Selma, whose husband Robert has disappeared. As before, telling you much of anything about the story would ruin it. There's a New Year's Eve party at a nightclub, a singer and dancer at the club who is involved, Cops and thugs and reporters and a good bit of insanity. And of course there's Asta, their terrier. Also Mrs. Asta and a litter of cute puppies."
4,Still Meaningful After All These Years,Great periscope view of the thirties. Everybody wears a mustach (except the women). Humor still valid. And cocktail- drinking? sheesh! Humor still valid. Good acting. And where does one find a marriage like this? Wonderful. Take me back (altho I wasn't even a gleam yet).
3,"Mixed experience- great movie, though","While I enjoyed the movie (watched it with my parents who love this series), the video came in spurts. I watched this through amazon's video on demand on a G5 iMac. There were several times where the video started chopping. At first I thought the lag was due to a lack of buffering, but throughout the movie (pausing to buffer every ten minutes) I decided that maybe the service wasn't there- amazon VOD was brand new at the time. Never once did it say that it was buffering, and pausing to let it buffer never actually changed the amount of time we could watch it without interruption. And it wasn't my parents' connection speed- they watch hulu all the time and had never seen a buffer in their life. For now, I chalk it up to a new service getting through the hiccups, but my folks are a hard sell to try it again. Maybe after amazon's VOD gets some positive press in a blog or news article I'll return to try it again."
1,Nice sports memorabilia but Dissapointing Audio/Video,"1975 NCAA Mens Final Four DVD was sadly dissapointing. There was no audio of the game, only a narrator's commentary and the footage was too brief. It was if I was watching WWII documentary-style file footage."
4,nice saw,Saw works very well. This particular saw was a little too expensive compared to other air saws available. Reasonably good quality. Files are very tiny and work well on smaller projects. Carrying case is handy to keep it all together.
1,They Didn't Last Long,I bought 3 of these for our Pocket PC's and two of the three batteries died and would not take a charge with in 30 days. One of them only last two days. I contacted the company (Hitech)for a replacement and they did not respond. I would recommend checking out a different brand.
3,Gil Evans,"This CD is a fine selection by Blue Note which is supposed to be limited. It is the combination of 2 LPs ""New Bottle Old Wine"" & ""Great Jazz Standards"" with different musicians on the albums, but all great artists conducted by the master. But you must love classical jazz even with Evans stunning arrangements ... Don't expect the wildness of ""Svengali""!Another interesting CD is the Gil Evans Orchestra ""Tribute To Gil"" recorded in 1988 in Perugia Umbria Jazz Festival following 2 CDs recorded live by Gil in 1987 as well as ""Last Session"" Sting & Gil Evans Live at Perugia Jazz Festival - July 11,1987 but if they are still available ..."
3,"FREDA PAYNE, STICK TO SINGING!! :)","C'mon, now, Full Moon Pictures...if you wanted to cast the role of a priestess of voodoo/black magic, Freda Payne didn't do the job here. She's such a great songstress to feature in this 2-bit role. In fact, at times I sensed she sang her lines, rather than spoke them! While the movie had it's high points, it was more comical than scary. More like a '90s version of Blacula! Hmmm...also who's the ruff-n-tuff guy who goes in-and-out of personalities ranging from Little Richard to Mike Tyson! What a riot!! The ragdoll puppet would have been more effective if special effects were geared to body movements, rather than motion-gliding through her slash scenes. The kids can stay up and watch this one...just them them the blood is grape jelly!! Great soundtrack from some unknowns, too!!"
5,partners in TIME,I know that all the mario fans would love to play this game. It's THE BOMB. I like the bros items best because they do lots of dammage and they look cool.I would say that every fan of mario would like this game.
4,He he he...not as funny,"Just finished this game. It didn't take me as long to finish as with the first (Superstar Saga), but I was kind of happy to end it. I thought I was goin to pull all of my hair out when I had to fight the REAL final battal, but it was easy. Those who played all of the way through know what I mean.I was expecting more laughs. The babys can get a little anoying, but they stop all the crying after a while. There were SOME good moments in this game. The boss battles are still fun, and the bros. attacks were fun. The badges that let you boost your stats are a nice addition as with the Cloths.If you liked the first, you will still like this game. If you have only played Partners in Time, and have yet to experience Superstar Saga...you're missing out."
2,Not a Real Mario Game,"I have always been a good Mario fan, but I was so disappointed when I received this game. The game just isn't what a Mario game needs to be. Instead of ""worlds"" like 1-1 or 5-4, it's just an adventure about them saving the kingdom from aliens. ( Where did that come from?)The controls are awkward. The game is definatly not fit for someone who gets aggervated easliy. I would also say the game is fit for ages 10+, strictly because the controls are that difficult.Well, if you are a big fan of the origanal Mario Brothers, don't buy this game. If you don't really care, you might like it. But I really didn't."
1,Blah Blah Blah,"Nintendo is getting out of hand. Mario games are getting crappier, crappier and crappier. Mario is for one year olds. He should die. Maybe Sonic, Halo or any other character that doesn't come from nintendo should be world famous than this weakest-character-in-the-video game-history. All of his games is junk."
5,"This is a fantastic game, very well written.","This game is not a typical Mario game. It's not fast paced and it's not very complex. It's a great story with a lot of humor and insider jokes that long time Nintendo fans will appreciate. The game is very long, you get your moneys worth out of it. It consists of Mario and Luigi, and their younger selves going through time portals trying to collect pieces of the puzzle to rescue Princess Peach. The action sequences are turn based, timing related. There isn't any use of the touch screen, however the top screen serves as a map and occasionally action scenes."
4,Mario and Luigi: Partners in Time,This game is a bliss for RPG lovers. I do not recommend this game at all for Mario fans.The game is very easy for kids. Attacking with weapons take time and minutes.
4,"OK for wine that needs help, but not the good wines !","Use this only on wines that need some help, that don't taste real good. Do NOT use it on wines that taste good !! We've used it on some wines that we almost poured out, and it really improved them !! Then, we tried it on a wine that already tasted good and we did not like the results at all... So, taste the wine first and then try the magnet with a small amount (before you use it on the whole bottle of wine). NOTE: We were skeptical that a magnet could change the taste of wine. I don't know how it works, but it does."
4,take off the foil !,"My wife is the WINEY in the family, so I was skeptical about ""magnets"" when she brought it home. We did both blind and non-blinded taste tests with the wine clip. Leaving the metal foil on the bottle neck does reduce any effect. The biggest improvement in taste, i.e. less bitter, tannic after-tastes, was in the economy wines. It was a little pricey but for the cost of 2 mid-range wines, it is a fun gadget."
4,wine clip,Heard about this from a fellow wine drinker and thought I would try it out myself. Am pleased with the results. I do not pretend to be a knowledgeable wine drinker but this seems to take the sharpness out of red wines.
1,There is a sucker born every minute,"If you just believe hard enough, it will work for you. Google ""Tice Clock"" sometime. Maybe you can use it to tune up your chakras when it's not turning bad wine to good."
4,The jury is still out,"The product arrived in time and in the condition as ordered. As far as the effectiveness goes, we are still in the process of completing blind taste tests. So far, most people don't see a difference but, to be fair, we probably should have a placebo to compare the results with. For now, the quality is good and the recommendation comes from a reliable source. Happy drinking."
1,NOT worth it !!!,"Hello, Unless I used this item incorrectly, I would rate it worthless ! The bottle of wine that I used it on was pretty decent, but the wine that came out of the bottle was horrible !!Cheryl W."
4,Nice looking yoga prop,This prop has a good feel and nice natural look. It's a little heavy for my taste--heavier than a foam block but much lighter weight and easier on the hands than a wood block.
1,VERY WEAK CHAIR,This is a very weak chair. We bought 4 of them and they all broke! Our daughter weighs 80 pounds and the weight limit says 180 weight limit. NOT TRUE! I do like the print on the chairs so I took them from the broken chairs and made wall hangings!
2,just ok. too few,"The rocks are not pebbles as stated, they are rocks. I also got nowhere near the picture. I know the disclaimer says it can be different, but this was way off. First 3 of my rocks are a bright turquoise color not a brown, gray or earthy color. I also only got 11 rocks. Stating only the ounces on this listing is ridiculous when the picture looks like ""pebbles"" I knew I was only getting a couple of ounces but at the pebble size it would have been enough for my project. Instead I have eleven rocks. I have small hands and I can fit all of them in one hand. It's definatly not enough for most projects. The candy rocks do look realistic though."
3,Good for Cakes,I bought those chocolate rocks for a birthday cake for my sons instruction site cake. The peoples are really great BUT the shipping costs are way to expensive :(
3,Chocolate Rock Candy,Wasn't too happy with the taste or size of candy. The candy is just too big for cake or cookies.
4,A good compilation but:,"The 2nd song It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday it's not the original song, it has a kind of remix sang different from the motownphilly album but the rest of the compilation are regular songs so if you are looking forward to have this specific song this is not the CD"
5,Complete technique book with excellent demonstrations,Got this as a bargain book at a local book store. What a bargain. One of the best illustrated books with a wide variety of demonstrations. I have tried several of the demonstrations and got excellent results and learned something in the process. Recommend it to the beginner or one who wants to improve their skills and have gone past the beginner level.
4,Castle brings joy,"My son had begged for this castle for his 10th birthday (he didn't care that it said recommended for ages 3-8), and asked every day after school if it had come. I was afraid he would be disappointed when it finally arrived, but he spent nearly four hours after school one day putting it together, foregoing video games and movies and play dates, and has played with it with his little sister and his friends nearly every day since then. I know some reports say it comes apart easily, but we haven't found this to be a particular problem. Lots of itty-bitty pieces, though."
1,Waste of money,"We purchased this for our 7 year old for Christmas. It took three hours to put together. After all of that work, it fell apart everytime the least little bit of pressure was put on it or we tried to move it from the floor to a table. I was even extra careful after the first fall apart incident. We were so fustrated that we even tried to super glue the larger sections together so that our son could get some play time out of it but that didn't even work!! It looks wonderful on the box but after weeks of it falling apart, it is in a box in the attic."
1,JUNK - JUNK - JUNK - JUNK - JUNK - JUNK - JUNK - JUNK,"I bought this for my son. He was so excited about it. It took my husband 3 hours to put it together. Everytime my child touches it, somethings breaks off. This is meant to be put together and put up on a shelf for decoration. I would NEVER buy another playmobil product based on my experience."
4,Towards a Thermodynamic Theory for Ecological Systems,"An excelent piece of theoretical work that makes relevant advances towards a re-edition of the ABC of Functional Ecology: energy and material flows in ecosystems. Particularly interesting in modelling thropic levels and chains, photosynthesis, and thermodynamics of the Biosphere.Nevertheless, and strangely enough, there is a main author omited as key reference: Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen"
3,Good and bad,"The towlet is a good size and with individual packaging you always have a moist towlet to clean up with instead of a pack of dried out tissues. The smell is unpleasant, too medicinal."
2,Weak on Theory,If you're interested in an overview of the subject of fuzzy logic this book may be adequate for your need. It is primarily a manual on how to use the shareware version of the software which is provided. I found this book inadequate in explaining the theory behind fuzzy logic
3,It's OK,"I haven't needed to use 1/2 of the stuff in it yet but for the price I was expecting better quality. The case and the tools feel cheep and I can't get the cheep plastic smell out of any of the things in it. The bulb sucker thing is really stiff and hard to use, I had to buy another one. I have also used the dropper and clippers, they worked fine. I think you could probably save a lot of money by buying everything separate but I'm glad I got a full kit instead because I had no idea what I was going to need."
2,Useless Nail Clipper,"The thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper. But it is very blunt!!! And the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible, unless baby's nail is very very long. If I wait until the nails are long enough to cut by this thing, my 3-month-old would have scratched his face and head. I end up buying a new baby nail clipper with a big handle and magnifying glass from nearby pharmacy. That worked much better."
5,everything needed to take care of my newborn baby,this item has everything needed to take care of my newborn baby and has items that are useful later on when she gets to be a bit older. Recommend
5,A perfect fit,"This footprint exactly fits the Kelty Teton 2. I had no issues with the dimensions. The poles fit into the brass grommets on the corners of the footprint with enough tension to keep them in place. If you have the tent, it's worth getting this footprint. The shipping was super fast, it arrived before the tracking info was online for whatever reason."
1,DOES NOT fit my Intrigue 2000 w/o spoiler.,"This model **DOES NOT** fit my Oldsmobile Intrigue 2000, despite the title line saying that it is for Intrigue 98-02 w/o spoiler - and I don't have a spoiler! It is 1 inch too long and could not be installed. I'm returning it."
1,Uninspired,"The content list seems impressive, but actually the selections are mundane and uninspired. There is lots of dissonance and the quality of the recordings is mixed. Seems so unlike Erich Kunzel, or Telarc for that matter."
3,not bad,"This is an fairly good playboy production. I was expecting better. I can tell you that as far as playboy videos go, there is a lot of naked beautiful women but aside from that, it barely kept my interest."
3,good cd,"ok ill be honest, i dont know who this musician is. im actually writting this b/c of a certian italian person, Corrado. Corrado, why r u writing all ur reviews in italian on an american website? from your titles, I infer that u r actually literate in english. r u insane? is this some kind of grass roots effort to get an italian amazon website? if so, u will fail. i will find u. Cheerio!"
5,like having a reiki treatment through music,everytime i lie down and listen to this I go into a trance. when i come out of it i feel like a new person. very remarkable.
3,Lerner and Loewe,"Great music from the creators of Brigadoon, Paint Your Wagon, My Fair Lady, Gigi, Camelot, and others. Good CD and I am pleased I bought it, but not as good as I normal expect from Kunzel and the Cincinnati Pops"
1,"Watch from dusk till dawn 1 and 2,don't waste your time on 3","I rented this movie when it came available to rent. I was sourly dissapointed,not only was the plot laughable but the coloring of the movie was terrible,i took back the rental to the video store to trade for another copy because i thought it could be the tape,turned out they mass produced a bunch of low quality tapes ,aside from the low quality,the movie was a big zero,if you haven't seen it don't waste your time."
3,an interesting prequel,"Even though FDTD3 is not as good as the first, it explains some things about the original movie. Anyone who liked FDTD should see this film. However, I would recommend that viewers watch THE HANGMAN'S DAUGHTER before watching FROM DUSK TILL DAWN just to have a better understanding of the two movies in general."
2,"Better than #2, much worse than #1 - A good idea wasted.","As a huge fan of the original FDTD, I was enthusiastic to see that they decided to do 2 sequels. I was scared too, because there was always a gib possibility that they's screw up. Well, they did. Part 2 was just a huge wast of time and one of the biggest disappointments ever. Part three is an improvement. I fell for the concept (FDTD meets Western) and really wanted to love it. I ended up not hating it ... which is not much of a compliment. The story is pretty close to the original's and the cast does an OK job, but there are no surprises. The creators try too hard to match the original's coolness and forget to make an interesting movie. Watch it once out of curiosity but be warned."
1,Um...no...,"I like the first film, even though it had it's flaws. I was somewhat bored by the second film, yet it had some moments that were entertaining. This movie seemed to try harder at first than the second film did, but it boils down to a piece of crap that ties onto one little (yet very hot) scene with the first movie. I was appalled that in the ending credits Tarantino, Rodriguez, and Lawrence Bender all get Exec. Producer credits for this film. I can just see all three of them on the set, rolling their eyes. I can't believe how this turned out after the first and second movie. None of the characters are very likeable, Danny Trejo and Orlando Jones (!?) are both in this giving it a little push, but it doesn't last. Don't see this film. If you're interest is strong, I won't stop you, but you are warned.NOT A KIDS FILM!"
4,An action packed begining !,"Virtually as soon as the film begins, so does the action. The movie starts with an outlaw who at the begining is about to be hanged by the ""hangman"", but the outlaw escapes with the hangmans daughter and throughout the movie the hangman pursues the outlaw. The main story however is the origin of Princess ""Pandomonium""(salma hayek's part in ""dusk till dawn"") and where all the vampires came from. Overall an action packed vampire film with a great story line that clears a lot up that dusk till dawn 2 did not only being surpased by ""dusk till dawn"". The DVD has only a deleted scene, but the picture and dolby 5.1 sound is superb!"
2,"a remake of the original, but cheaper, uglier, less funny.....","Imagine a remake of the original, but cheaper, uglier, less funny, less dramatic, with less action, poorer special effects, and no-name actors. Here you go.This is described as a western re-imagining of the great Tarantino flick, and plus, Michael Parks is top-billed (love him). QT is an executive producer to boot. But my god. Just so boring, unoriginal, ugly, unfunny, not exciting. I give it as much as 5 out of 10 because the western-themed intro to the story (about 30-40min) was promising if clunky; however once the plot moved to an old-west version of the demon bar with dancing vampires, it was all downhill.Only for those who have never seen the original."
5,AWWWWWSOME,FDTD3 DELIVERD LOT OF ACTION.I WAITED A LONG TIME TO SEE THIS MOVIE. IT WAS WELL WORTH IT. NOT ONLY IS IT ACTION PACKED. ITS A WELL TOLD STORY. ROBERT RODRIGUEZ AND TARANTINOPICKED AND DAMN GOOD DIRCTOR.
1,Worse than part 2,"I don't know why people are praising this film. They must be mad because they bought the movie and didn't get their money's worth. And now they want to trick people into buying it. (I couldn't think of a better reason.. so sue me.) There is no action in the movie involving vampires until the last thirty minutes of the movie. The best part though is the DVD's one deleted scene. That alone is better than the whole movie. I wonder why they didn't keep it in the movie? There is a big shoot out in the movie but I've seen better. If you like 70s & 80s westerns..... not the great ones like Young Guns, I mean corny westerns like Bananza (okay, maybe a little better than that) then you might enjoy this movie. But be warned, RENT IT FIRST! That's what I did and I'm glad I did."
4,dusk dawn,its the third one and usually there not that good but this one hanged in there i gave the first four stars to. make a great vampire series.alot of gore
2,Vampires in the Old West!!!,"In my opinion, this prequel is the weakest of the trilogy because it's really boring, and takes a while for things to get interesting. It shows how Esmeralda came to be Santanico Pandemonium from the original. Part 3 takes place 100 years before the original and shows that Vampires were still eating people at the Titty Twister. I would not recommend FROM DUSK TILL DAWN 3: THE HANGMAN'S DAUGHTER!!!"
4,Wearable Ionizer for pets,"We got this really quickly. I purchased it for my cat. He has chronic sinus trouble and allergies. Trying to give him antihistamines requires protective gear! This seemed to work well for him. We were calling him ""Green Lantern"", because of the ""on"" indicator light shining in dark. After about 3 weeks, he submerged the ionizer, while getting a drink. (It's history if it gets wet.) Need to replace the batteries about once a week, so rechargeables are a good idea."
4,Best Slim Fast Meal Bar,"I only gave 4 stars because....well, it's a ""diet"" bar. In my opinion this is the best tasting Slim-Fast Meal Bar. I've tried them all and this is by far my favorite. It also has a healthy does of vitamins and minerals. It says it keeps you full for up to 5 hours, but I don't think so....at least not for me. Very tasty though. I wish it contained a few less calories, it has 220 and the ""shake"" only has 190."
1,Buyer Beware!,Please pay attention to what your getting for $42.00. This is for one box of 12 1.97 ounce bars!! This is the price that amazon previously charged for three boxes!!!!
5,Slim Fast Bars,These bars are one of the greatest tasting things I've ever had. They have also helped me lose 30 lbs.
2,not work as advertised,"i followed the steps on the back of the carton (eat one for breakfast, one with your lunch, and one with your dinner) and i still felt hungry after every one and it was sooner than 4 hours. the taste is neglible to say the best (if you like the taste of sandpaper) overall its average to say the least, not even fit to be a snack."
5,Instrumental masterpiece,"Folk revival classics is a good title for this CD. I already own it and now I'm buying more copies for family and friends. 14 great instrumental renditions of songs from the 60's and early 70's. Big yellow taxi, Cat's in the cradle, Fire & Rain, Midnight Cowboy, One Tin Soldier, If you could read my mind, The times they are a-changin', American pie, California dreamin', For what it's worth, Wild world, The sound of silence, Time in a bottle and leaving on a jetplane."
2,Hi noise level,Product works well but the fan is too noisy to run in the background with a conversation or TV running.
1,Big (actually little) Disappointment,"Smaller than thought (my fault for not checking dimensions better), fan motor and fan so small, well, will leave it at that!"
1,Bad Company,"Got product, did not work. Company did not send return authoriaztion number. Amazon.com was no help. Stay away from these people."
4,Good way to move air between rooms,"This fan installed easily and is out of the way. No more fans blocking the doorway and I can put the wires along the door frame, out of the way. It is very quite and does not distract. The only thing preventing a perfect score was a slight imperfection in the construction allowed the fan to tap a cord. It only took a minute or two for me to push the wire fully into the housing, though. I am pleased with this product and am glad I bought 2 of them."
2,not good,"This works, but not well.First, it's smaller than I'd imagined.It moves an OK amount of air for it's size, but it is LOUD. I can't stand it being on when I'm around.The worst part is that there's no way to adjust the speed. It's either on or off. If I could slow it down to make it tolerable to have to listen to, it might be useful.It attachs to the wall by a pair of screws that you first put in place and then slide the fan onto."
2,"Moves air well, but LOUD!","This fan is easy to install and moves air very well. However, it is extremely loud and for that reason not very practical for our family."
4,Moves a lot of air but loud!,I really like this fan. It was easy to install and going in no time. It is very loud though so I don't use it as often as I hoped I would.
3,Noisy,"My father purchased this fan to move some of the hot air from the pellet stove in the kitchen to the living room. The fan moves a moderate amount of air, but that does come with some fan noise due to the high (and non-adjustable) RPMs that it operates at.The fan also had a very annoying noise while operating, so I opened it up to find that one of the wires that is taped down to the transformer was hitting the blades as they whirred by with mere millimeters of clearance. After I pushed the wire down as flat as I could get it and reassembled the fan, it was not quite as loud or annoying anymore. If you want a whisper quiet fan then this is not the one for you, but if your home is moderately noisy then it won't bother you at all.This fan moves just as much air as the overpriced fans they were selling at our local pellet stove store, for half the price."
2,very noisy and flimsy,"it is very noisy and very expensive for this flimsy plastic fan. Easy to install but once in place it makes a humming all thru the house, we were able to reduce the hum by putting a felt pad between the fan and the door frame."
1,Loud & not so hot,Easy installation is best I can say. Very loud and doesn't move the air well at all -- even in a small 2 room area. I'll use the simple oscillating model on the floor instead.
3,good but loud,"The fan moves a lot of air, but it's loud--combined with my pellet stove fan, it makes for a lot of ambient noise. Because of that, I run it only at night. Nevertheless, it gets the job done."
4,Doorway Fan is great,"The Doorway Booster Fan RR100 is a great, it moves the heat from the room that has to much, into the room that needs more. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because it could be a little quieter."
1,"Sorry, but I can not recommend this",This fan fits great in the coner of a door frame and was very easy to install. It makes more noise than you would think and hardlly moves any air.
1,horrible door fan,Product did not do what it said it would do. Mounted the doorway fan exactly like it said and found no difference in room temperature.I would not recomend this product whatsoever.
2,Loud and Weak,"Very loud and annoying fan. Easy to mount but needs sound dampening between unit and the wall. The review with the computer vs this fan is not accurate. This fan is way louder than any other fan I own. Also, this unit moves very little air."
2,pass the earplugs,"Great idea, if you can tolerate the noise. After reading several other reviews which claimed they'd not had a noticeable noise issue with this fan, we took a chance on it. It does seem to move a significant amount of are, given it's size, and when we first turned it on we thought ""oh, it's not that loud"". But sitting in a room with it on gets annoying as it does actually produce quite a drone. I'm not sure there is a better solution to moving warm air past our low doorway though, so we'll keep it."
1,broke,"Bought mine last year, yesterday I went to check it because it had been make a vibrating noise that it normally did not make. I found one of the blades had broke off and had jammed the motor. The fan was installed as directed and had just hung in the doorway, so why the fan broke I can only say it was material failure, which given the operation is not acceptable. In addition i have to agree with other posts about not moving air as advertised. I will not be buying a replacement entreeair fan."
1,I don't like this fan,This thing is too noisey and doesn't move much air. I would not recommend this to anyone.
3,"Works, But It's Loud.","This does work, but it's just too loud. They need to make one with a quiter motor."
3,Perfect for what I need,"I have gas wall units. They do not have blower fans. This helps move the heat from just sitting in front of the heater. Only caveat is they only last a couple of seasons. They are made of plastic, and the fan falls apart after awhile. This is my third replacement. It would get 5 stars if they lasted. But they do what I need, so I keep buying them."
4,Doorway Fan,The fan was easy to install and is doing the jobI had hoped for. I would recommend this productfor moving heat around to normally colder sections ofthe home......................
1,Useless and died within 3 months,"This product did not last long at all, and did not work while it did. I would pass on this product ."
2,"deceptive photo, very loud fan",Photo on box suggests that the fan is fairly thin. Actually the curved side measures about 3 1/2 inches wide--this is not a discreet fan. Also I find it very noisy. Would not buy again but instead seek out a sleeker and quieter model.
1,Doorway Booster Fan RR100,"This is a very small fan, it does a bad job of cooling anything. I suppose you could use it to cool a kitchen shelf, that's about it!"
1,Garbage,"Don't waste your money if you are looking to move even a decent amount of air from even a small area like my small closet. The only thing this thing ""boosted"" was the money from my wallet. Dont know how this is called a booster fan. Unless you wet your hand and put it in the air stream you wont feel much air lol."
1,Not a good product...,"As per another reviewer of this product, mine also suffered a spontaneous blade disintigration. I had the fan for just over two months to pull the warm air from the room we have our pellet stove in to the bedroom. I heard a strange vibration out of it yesterday and as I was walking over to inspect it, I heard a bang like a gunshot!! When I got to the fan and unplugged it, the blades were all in pieces. There was no indication for this beforehand so I am not sure what happened. Before this I would say it was so-so effective, it was better at moving dust from room to room I think than heat! Still debating if I am going to buy a replacement."
1,MISLEADING,The picture makes you believe you are buying a jack when in fact this is a TURNING BAR for a jack.THIS IS NOT A JACK THAT IS BEING SOLD.
3,Not as good as some of thier other stuff,"I bought this cd mainly because I have War of Ages self titled CD (which btw, is amazing) and ended up kind of disappointed. I think it stands on its own but when compared to their self titled cd it seems a bit boring."
1,Don't make me sick with another of these dolls!!!,Uhhhhh.....I just have to say how much i HATE THESE UHHGLY DOLLS!!!!!!! Come on! They're ugly!! Wee 3 friends dolls are cooler and prettier!! I'd much rather have those......[...]
1,uHHHgly!!!*,"In real-life, Hilary Duff is a sweet girl with a beutiful face........But as a doll she's an uhhgly peice of junk!!! Don't waste your money on this terribly-made doll! It doesn't look anything like Hil!! It isn't even pretty!! Hil is pretty! Come on peeps!! I wish they would hire a different company to make dis doll......Like the company that makes Shakira dolls........now those ARE pretty......"
1,Awful Doll !?!?!,I agree with everyone else here this doll is awful DO NOT BUY IT!!! it's a complete waste of money she looks nothing like hilary duff and the clothes she comes with is nothing like hiary duff its awful.The mary-kate and ashley dolls are a great recommendation because they look exactly like them and they are excellent quality so if i was you i'd give the hilary duff doll a miss and buy the mary-kate and ashley dolls instead they are awesome.
2,Come ON!!!,I can't understand why they would even make a doll like this.It is soooo ugly and it's hands are bent in a stange way.Hilary fans stick to the posters 'cause this doll is terible.
3,The Hilary Duff toy i nothing special.,"The toy wasn't as fun as I thought,. The Mary-Kate and Ashley toys were a lot more fun because you could actually play with them more. And unlike the Hilary Duff toy, it actually looked like them.Oh and also Hilary Duff's nose is too big."
3,not really realistic,"i feel that hilary duff is a very talented singer,actress,and movie star. she is very pretty and these dolls do not show it. the doll look really nothing like her. althoughh the doll comes with nice outfits and accessories the dool isn't really realistic looking. if you want a celeberty dool that is fun and looks almost the the star check out the Mary-kate and ashley dolls...i would most definitlyrecommend them."
1,SUCKS OUTRAGE OF HILARY DUFF,I LOVE HILARY DUFF BUT BUUT THIS IS A OUTRAGE IT'S UGLY DOSN'T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE HER I CAN'T RATE ANYTHING BECOUSE YOUR NEVER SEE ME COUGHT DEAD WITH THIS TOY!!!!! IF YOU WERE A REAL FAN OF HILARY YOU WOULDN'T BUY A UGLY TOY HILS SOOOOO PRETTY AND THIS IS U-G-L-Y (...)|O(
3,not what I expected,"Although this has beautiful tones, it takes a 20 mph wind to make it move. I have a much less expensive (and lower quality) wind chime that hangs four feet from this one which plays in gentle breezes"
4,Iris folding looks elegant and is easy to do!,"With easy to understand instructions and clear patterns, this little book is all you need to make beautiful spirals of folded papers. Named for the illusion of looking into the iris of one's eye, iris folding is easy and relaxing to do."
1,Too small,"This book is very small, about the size of a childs Golden Book. there are much better books out on Iris folding. The content is ok but you'd need to enlarge the templates. I sent the book back."
4,Great Iris folding book,"This is a very good book about Iris Folding. Thye use the European method of using folded strips of paper in their designs, but they can also be done the American way of using unfolded strips which makes the designed images much thinner and easier to mail. Style not withstanding, these are beautiful designs and not that hard. I highly recommend this book."
3,Good - Not especial!,"The book has good ilustrations, but is not a special book! All informations are spread all over internet. For me it's an Okay book!"
3,Great tips for whom is thinking to buy this differentiate breed.,Great tips for whom is thinking to buy this differentiate breed.Valuable book. I reccomend. A complete pet owner's manual.
4,good basic info,"This is a nice basic book, good for a beginner with the breed. The information is presented clearly without talking down to the reader."
4,Valuable information,"Great book - comprehensive guide for whippet owners. Useful information for those primarily interested as a pet owner rather than those looking for specialised advice on breeding, showing etc. Highly recommended. Should be mandatory reading for all prospective/new whippet owners. The information is detailed yet highly readable. The writing is of an excellent standard making it a pleasure to read."
2,Too many English lyrics. Not suitable for Spanish inst.,This book seems geared to teachers who know little or no Spanish. I mistakenly bought it as a supplement to my Spanish classes and found that the lyrics were mostly English. The tunes did not fit well with the lyrics.
2,spanish piggyback songs,I bought this book years ago hoping to use it with my bilingual Kindergarten class. I was very disappointed with it. These songs are not in Spanish. They are a mixture of English and Spanish. These songs are very confusing for children who are expected to learn both languages at the same time. I was however able to translate/tweek the English lyrics and use only Spanish.
1,Caution!,"The DVD I ordered did not contain ""Seabiscuit"" but instead consisted of a really vile ""movie"" called ""Hot Dog"" with wet T-shirt contests and the like. I assume this was a mixup at the factory(?) So be sure to check yours out before giving it to a family member (as I was planning to do!)"
4,Inspiring!,"We watched this quite a while after watching the Seabuscuit motion picture, and found it to be very interesting and inspiring. Such an amazing story!"
5,Ace,"Ace was one of the few pub-rock groups to enjoy success on the pop charts, largely due to the warm, soulful vocals of Paul Carrack. Carrack's voice certainly had crossover appeal - as he would later prove with his own solo records, as well as his work with Squeeze and Mike & The Mechanics. The band was also less devoted to the three-chord boogie and country-rock that marked most pub-rock bands, favoring soulful R&B. After developing a dedicated following on the pub-rock circuit, Ace signed with Anchor Records, and recorded the smash U.K./U.S. hit. ""How Long."" After Carrack left the group in 1979 he sang with Roxy Music. Later he launched a solo career, which he balanced with playing with artists like Squeeze, Nick Lowe and Mike & The Mechanics."
5,good product,I have been buying the fram air filter for the life of my vehicle. I have had no problems with them. The amazon price is a little cheaper than in store if you get free shipping.
4,"Exact fit,",Worked as expected. I would buy it again if needed. I now have K/N on all of my vehicles. Good value.
4,Easy Model MRC F-4U Corsair,"It is a good replica with a good amount of detail. I bought it it to use as a model to build a scale remote control plane. I am copying the paint scheme because it is very accurate. A child playing with this model will break off small parts, but the basic plane will hold together. It's a display model, not reall a play toy!"
1,Great idea - badly created,"I bought this item so that I have a small MP3 player with enough space and I don't have to use the cord every time I want to download songs. The design is fine, the commands are confusing though and the headphones are less than satisfactory. The main problem with the device is when it reaches the end of playlist, or it bumps into an unknown format file, it shows ERROR message on the display and you can continue playing songs only if you turn it off - and back on - it does not recognize other buttons. This error sign is very worrying considering that this is a flash drive and is meant to have other file formats other than .wma and .mp3. It is practically impossible to listen to anything without switching it off and back on at least once in 10 minutes."
1,Awful,"Terrible acting combined with a storyline that is not even porn-industry worthy. Worst 2 hours of my life. I can't believe there are people out there that actually enjoyed this film. Don't waste your time. As a side note, shouldn't there be sidelines somewhere on your college football field? This was obviously produced and directed by someone not too familiar with sports. This was just an awful attempt at an emotional sports film. I wish I could give less than one star."
3,Good Movie,This Was an ok movieI'm a big football fan so I had to see it wish I woulda rented it instead.If I could return it I wouldOk MovieActing was ok
2,"Schubert 4, Dvorak 1","I would have preferred an all Schubert program, though I don't believe Schubert ever wrote a piano concerto. The Dvorak puts me to sleep, regardless of the excellent forces employed to play it. Currently, I'm looking for another ""Wanderer Fantasy"" performance..."
5,A great finding!,"I had seen this CD over and over at different music stores, but I was always unsure about buying it. However, after reading some positive reviews about it I decided to give it a try! I've listened it four or five times already (in less than three days) and I must confess that I'm quite happy that I decided to buy it.The Dvorak piano concerto is quite beautiful; actually more than what I expected it to be! It is filled with lovely melodies (just as a review that I read said!). The second movement in particular is quite enchanting! I'm really delighted!Schubert's Wanderer Fantasy is fantastic! I bought this CD without knowing what a great work this is! Richter's playing is awesome, absolutely stunning!This is yet another fabulous CD from the amazingly affordable ""Great Recordings of the Century"" series from EMI! A must for all Richter fans!!!"
1,not the same as i think,"the shipping is not fast. i order a new DVD, however, it is not a stealed one, making me think this is a used DVD."
1,Amazing movie,"Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter truly shined in this film, I highly doubt Oscars are too far out of the questi-...Oh wait. Nevermind. I though this was the Sweeney Todd page. Nevermind this film sucks the big one! Need I say more! It sucks so much I can't even give it a full review."
5,This is my favorite movie ever!!!,"This movie is really good. I have watched it 5 times and I still really like it. My mom really liked it too, she thought it was cute. I really recomend this movie to anyone who wants a good movie to share with their kids."
2,A Whiff of Fascism,"I know, this is a very popular movie and the music is OK. But the story is stridently insipid: winners win because that's what winners do, and losers lose because there's something wrong with anyone who's not a winner...and don't talk to me about underdogs. Despite the best efforts of its heroically perky cast, the film is nearly humorless. It was suggested that we stage this at our high school, but I've black-balled it."
4,My kids love it,My kids are into theater and dance and they love the whole series of High School Musical movies. They love to sing and dance along with the cast and that is enjoyment enough for me.
2,Not what I thought,I just didn't find that this book was very informative. It wasn't what I needed. I think it may be a little out dated.
1,dumb,this was the worst movie i have ever seen. do me a favor and dont buy this. spend your money on any movie except this one.
2,save your money on this one,i love northern exposure and the renaissance collection...but i was really let down on this one... i just found the tempo to be too repetitive... each track sounds just slightly different from the next... i lost interest very fast.
2,Boring,This CD is boring and lifeless. There are only a few moments worth listening to a second time. A waste of money.
2,Well...,"Maybe the problem is I'm not just a huge Digweed fan, but this cd really didn't do it for me. It's not awful, don't get me wrong, but I just didn't care for the tracks he chose to include.In general the cd is fairly fragmented; he'll butt a slowish song up against a more hard hitting one and the overall effect is you're constantly waiting for him to get to the point and he just never does.If you're a fan of his stuff, then this cd is probably one of his better ones, and if you like a more harsh, more sparse type of trance, give this a try as well. Otherwise, don't waste your money."
2,John Digweed can do better and definately plays better,I have had the opportunity to hear him play with and with out Sasha and he plays much better than this mediocre compilation. The first cd is just boring. There is no energy to the songs. They just plod on and on. The second CD picks up speed and actually lashes out in the middle. High energy trance and techno that don't miss a beat. It's just the boring tracks in the beginning of the cd and basically the whole first cd. Does that song by danny tenaglia actuall go anywhere? No.
4,TWO HOURS OF LISTENING PLEASURE,"WITH DEEP DARK TRANCY MUSIC THAT HAS A SUBTLE TONE BUT REALLY COMES ON HARD. DIGWEED COMES UP WITH A SMILE SLAPS YOU IN THE FACE AND THEN LEAVES WITH YOU BEGGING FOR MORE, THEN HE GIVES IT TO YOU."
3,NOT what i expected,The first Global Underground CD i bought was Sashas in SanFrancico . .which i thought was great...I guess ihad too high of expectations for Diggers...The first CD..went no where..it was boring to listen to..but the second CD was only mediocre...Could havebeen much better
2,Digger's Mediocre Effort,"It's starts off pretty good with ""imagine"", i thought maybe that Digweed was gonna take us on another Northern Exposure. But a couple of tracks down the line, the tempo becomes continuous and rather dull... it's almost like he got lost in the mix. When he mixs in Tenaglia it makes the mix even worst, making left confuse, is this the same dj that help make ""Northern Exposure"" series and ""Renaissance Mix Collection"". The second disc has it's mix of hard trance which reaches peak time alittle too early with PVD's ""Words"" (For Love), the declining climax is even worst with rather dull ending tracks.The cd mixs isnt that great, but i am willing to give Digger another shot on ""Global Underground: Hongkong"" . I hope that turns out better."
4,half of it is good...,"I am not a big fan of house music, which is predominant on the first disc, but the second disc is worth buying the set for, if you like good, melodic, but driving trance."
1,Great company / Poorly made product,"When I ordered these I thought that they were made in the USA. Wrong, made somewhere south of the border. My slippers came with very thin laces that looked as though they were cut with an exact o knife, not the thick leather laces as pictured. The first time I tightened the laces they broke. I sent them back to Amazon. I also emailed Minnetonka and complained. The CEO wrote me back with an apology. He thanked me for bringing the poor laces to his attention. The company sent me a free pair to make up for my trouble! Amazing Customer Service. The new pair did have the thick leather laces as pictured however after three days of use the stitching around the top, which looks like some kind of straw has already begun to come unraveled. I can not recommend these disappointing slippers."
3,Decent Slipper but nothing great,"I bought these as I sent back Minnetonka Men's Twin Gore Sheepskin Slipper. I sent the twin gore back because they were way too narrow. This slipper was the closest thing I wanted that came in a wide. I am not sure why my Minnetonka Men's Twin Gore Sheepskin Slipper review is not showing up, but in it I stated that I wear a 8 in mens. So I bought these in a 9 wide, thinking I would have toe room and the wide may even be a regular mens width. They are still a quarter to a half inch too narrow for real comfort. Before I stand to walk I must make sure my foot is at the outter edge. What is just as sad, I lined these up with my girlfriend's Minnetonkas, and hers are wider than mine!These slippers are not built with much quality. I pulled them out of the box, the sheepskin was coming out of the front. Nearly each time I pull my foot out some sheepskin falls out. I had to double knot the laces because they came undone every 10 minutes."
4,I'm Very Surprised,"I've been looking at what types of moccasins to purchase for a very long time, and at first, I was very hesitant to buy this exact pair. I thought that it may have been priced pretty high just because of the brand name. Boy, was I wrong. The moccasins are extremely comfortable. Unlike other reviews, I've never had a problem with them. I reccomend these to anyone who wants a good slipper in the house, or a great,comforting shoe to wear anywhere."
2,Great size and look. Horrible reception,"The product is great but the phone has to be within 4 - 5 feet for it to work good. There have been times when it has been closer than 3 feet and there has been a lot of static.I read other reviews and they spoke of the bad reception, but now I'm a believer. I even sent my first one back because I thought it was defective. My second one has equally bad reception and I use it in different environments and places, so it's not just where I'm using it."
3,It is not as one announces.,The reception is good nonexcellent.The tolerance distance is smaller to the specified one.He is very delicate in use and handling.It is very easy to lose the pieces.I do not recommend it.
1,piece of trash,"i recieved this product expecting a quality item it being sold by amazon. unfortunatly this was not the case the plantronics headset is hard to adjust, uncomfortable to wear and if you like people calling you back to say they couldn't understand you BUY THIS ITEM. plantronics tech help is a joke"
4,"BEST BLUETOOTH HEADSET I'VE HAD, BUT NOT PERFECT","THE PLANTRONICS DISCOVERY 655 BLUETOOTH HEADSET THAT I RECENTLY BOUGHT IS BY FAR THE BEST OF THE EIGHT BLUETOOTH HEADSETS THAT I HAVE OWNED, WHICH INCLUDED THREE OTHER PLANTRONICS MODELS - THE EXPLORER 220, THE VOYAGER 520, AND THE DISCOVERY 650E. IT IS WELL WORTH THE DISCOUNTED PRICE OR EVEN SUBSTANTIALLY MORE. UNLIKE MOST OF THE HEADSETS THAT I'VE HAD, IT IS QUITE LOUD AT FULL VOLUME - I HAD TO STRAIN TO HEAR WITH MOST OF THE OTHERS. THE NOISE CANCELLATION WORKS VERY WELL, BUT DOES NOT PERFORM MIRACLES. I DON'T USE THE OPTIONAL EAR CLIP BECAUSE IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE TO ME, AND THE RIGHT ONE OF THE THREE PROVIDED EAR GELS WORKS WELL. I GOT THIS SOAKING WET RECENTLY AND I AM REPLACING IT WITH A 665A TO GET THE CAR CHARGER.Plantronics Discovery 665A Bluetooth Headset (Black/Silver)"
3,"OK sound, Poor quality -- didn't expect this from you Plantronics","Just got this headset today and had really high expecations from it. However, so far my experience has been mixed.Pros:1. Clear sound, easy pairing2. With the earloop fits wellCons:1. Picks up wind noise2. Doesn't stay in without the earloopsAnd on the quality side -- I found that the provided AAA battery charger and the USB charger both don't work. I can only charge the unit using the custom Plantronics connector."
3,works great ... if you are alone in a silent room,"ordered this item based on reviews and the great Amazon price ... then waited many weeks to recieve a product that is in stores but Amazon was slow shipping.Looks great. Fits great. Charges great. I can hear the callers clearly, with great volume options. Controls are simple and effective.And by all reports, folks on the other end can hear me clearly ... if I'm alone in a silent room. In a car with ambient noise it works okay, but not great. Walking down a city street, callers couldn't hear me at all.I wish I hadn't wasted my money."
2,"Great audio quality, but other problems abound","I bought this headset on July 3rd, 2007 and fell in love with it after the first time I used it, but with in 3 days it was already acting up and by July 7, 2007 I couldn't even turn the headset off at all so I returned it and got the Jabra BT8010 instead. Not this wasn't my only problem with the headset.I also didn't like the gel piece that went into my ear as after wearing for a little while it would make my ear sore, also I learned quickly that if I didn't get a hold headset before pushing the answer button it would jam the gel earbud into the ear which was also quite painful, so all in all if you are looking for comfort look else where."
2,Works great; bad industrial design,"While I love the mic sensitivity, noise DSP and small size, this item has a major design flaw in that the physical connection from the earbud to the main unit constantly falls apart. The connect point is very delicate, with just a couple tiny plastic flanges to connect the earbud to the main unit. While Plantronics is usually very good, this one was a big miss - look elsewhere.The Aliph Jawbone looks interesting, and that's where I may be headed next."
2,Plantronics 655 Bluetooth,"I was on a search for a functional bluetooth and purchased the Plantronics 655 in addition to 3 others: Motorola HS700, Motorola HS850 and Genum Nxzen Plus. I was unsatisfied with and returned the Plantronics 655. It's a stylish way to talk to people in quiet locations and clarity of receiver is great. HOWEVER, voice is muffled on the receiving end, gel earpiece is uncomfortable, ear hook is also uncomfortable and doesn't keep it's shape when repositioned, AND it's hard to hear in crowds or in the car with the windows open. I prefer function over aesthetics and the Plantronics 655 didn't suit my needs."
3,Plantronics 640 is better,"I had the 655 and lost it. Then replaced it with the Plantronics 640 and found it easier to press the buttons (softer to press, and the 640 has a black ring around the button which makes it easier to hold as you press), the light is less annoying/bright, the 655 has an optional digital mode, which consumes more battery and does not improve sound quality. The 64o does not have this option. The chargers are the same, but the holder for the 640 is different from the 655. The 655 has the nifty USB adapter for the holder, the 640 does not.bad for both: The Earbuds are easy to break off for both models.Good for both: ease of use while wearing glasses."
1,Deceptive advertising!,"I'd been using the Plantronics Explorer 320 for almost a year now, and had been very happy with it, so we bought the Discovery 655 for my wife. The blurb claims ""upto 10 hours talktime"", but what it does not make very clear is that the 10 hours are NOT continuous!!! You only get 10 hours if you carry around their battery-powered pocket charger, and is based on the fact that a single battery can give you 3 charges. The headset's charge only lasts for a mere 3.5 hours! Needless to say, we were very disappointed, and have returned the product."
1,Plantronics Discovery 655 DSP Ultimate Bluetooth with DSP,"I purchased the headset, it arrived in a very good time frame. The model itself is very interesting, has alot of parts, the charger is not very handy, and requires alot of tweaking to figure out, once you have, it is not that bad.However, the standby time was quoted as being around 270 hours without talk. I was getting closer to 36-48 hours tops, without talk, before it was fully discharged from a full charge. Less if I talked. Possible battery malfunction, I am not sure.I had to RMA this back to them, due to the lack of charge the phone would produce. The ear pieces, for being made out of a soft plastic, were very hard on the ear canal as well, and took over a week before it stopped hurting the surrounding parts of my ear.Overall satisfaction: Extremely poor."
1,Plantronics Discovery 655,"The sound quality is not bad. It comes with 3 ear pieces, it comes with 3 ear pieces - small, medium and large and a hook to remain in place. I was looking for a blue tooth that would fit my small ears. Unfortunately, the ear piece part does not remain locked. As a result I lost the small ear pierce and the middle ear piece in less than a month. Now i need to see if i can order replacement ear pieces"
3,Unfortunately the sound quality is not so good.,"I thought I had lost my Motorola bluetooth, a discontinued model that I only paid $ 15.00 for, and I got this one because of the handy dandy clip, and AAA battery charger unit.Unfortunately the sound quality is not so good. The caller sounds muffled. The sound quality of the Motorola I had was better. I have had no complaints from those on the other end. They can hear me fine.The clip is nice. I can clip the bluetooth inside my purse and not have to dig for it. I haven't lost it yet. I keep the AAA battery charger unit at work.I would not recommend this product unless it was $ 15.00. I did find my Motorola and sold it to a friend. I want it back."
2,Not up to expectations,"I purchased this unit because it was considered the ""best"" at blocking out background noises, such as in the car. After using it a half dozen times, I have concluded that technology has a long way to go. With the windows closed, the radio off, and in a quiet car, it still picks up much background noise and occasionally creates an echo on the other end of the line. It is better than any unit I tried in a store, but in my opinion not what it is hyped to be."
5,Excellent headset,Range is not far at all but it is very comfortable and the reception and call quality is far better than expected. This is my first bluetooth headset and I am now a convert!**UPDATE** I tried using it in the car and no one can hear me at all. My interior is a bit noisy but it seems to work great in quiet rooms but not really anywhere else. I no longer use it at all due to the complaints that no one can hear me. I can hear everyone very well so listening in on a conference call is still a possibility. Battery life is FAR longer than expected. I listened in on a 3 hour conference without a problem.
2,Not a fan,"It's very awkward to get this thing positioned in the ear, and once it's there it has that horrible Star Trek kind of look--it's big. It's a pain to pair. Sometimes I would have to go into my iPhone's bluetooth settings to get it to reconnect--one of the things that most annoys me about devices like this and why I despised and disposed of my Jawbone. But the most annoying thing about it is the lag between the time you hit the button on the side and the time you either pick up or end a call. What's with that? It has zilch noise cancellation--if you want someone to hear every breeze in your environment amplified to hurricane-force, wear one of these things. It didn't cost much, but it isn't worth much. I'm not a fan."
3,Not a good fit,"Nice piece, but the little rubber earpiece doesn't fit into my ear canal. The less expensive Plantronics fit much better. Save your money"
1,need to exchange defective,Can you send me an email to exchange it for a replacement this is the second one purchased the first one works great the second has static anywhere its used the phone is a blackberry are they not canpatable with this product? can you respond as soon as possible thanks.
2,okay but lacking,"I read all the reviews and thought I new what it was all about but found it to be even a bit short of my expectations which weren't set real high1, range - i wear it on my left ear. if i hold my phone in my right hand it will sometimes start getting a week signal. this lack of distance is really just unacceptable2, sound - everyone i have asked knows i'm talking through something. they say it sounds like i'm in a tunnel.3, the ear pieces - if they fit your ear it will probably work well. if they don't you'll have to come up with a solution. i have chosen to use the smallest one and 'hang' it in my ear because the other two don't fit well and i don't have 10 minutes to try to make the thing fit.4, the ear hook - i tried it - it doesn't flex and hold a position like other ear pieces. it's just a somewhat hard piece of plastic that wants to return to it's shape thereby making it uncomfortable and not to helpful.I am disappointed in the product."
3,"Headset works well, but falls apart.","The device works well and has great clarity of sound. However, the way the piece was designed to use the wrap around ear piece as an optional thing. When you attach it and place the ear piece on it will come apart as soon as you take it off of your ear. The ear piece will click into place, but it isn't locked in place. That needs to be redesigned. We decided to return the product and go with something that has a fixed wrap around piece."
4,Very good value,"Great price, 1/2 the cost of many sellers, very small with a great ear gel to fit very comfortably, barely know its there Highly recommend"
3,good product by plantronic,"I've been a plantronic man for a while. the last 4 years I have been served well by the products of plantronic.This unit is good, fits my ears well, my main concern was the comfort of the product. I still get the quality sound that I had from the last unit but this one is more pleasing."
1,Gel Buds Design Flaw,"Don't even think about buying this product; there is a huge design flaw that severely outshadows any of the positives. The gel ear buds do not stay on the headset. To put them on and take them off, you put the bud in the ""neutral"" position then push it on and then twist it to the right or left, depending upon which ear you prefer. The problem is that the bud keeps rotating back to neutral and then falls right off. I complained to the Plantronics company and they told me where I could purchase replacement parts! I told them I wasn't paying for replacement parts for a product that was very poorly designed in the first place. This headset has been returned but I just wanted to warn everone who had read the excellent reviews about the product to not even consider this one."
2,not quite road-worthy,"I am the target for this item. I'm on the phone and on the road constantly. I love these kind of toys.The sound quality for this headset was great. I could hear fine from my motorola, but others couldn't hear me, this item resolved that.However, the ability to change the ear bud sizes means that the ear bud gets knocked off easily, and I don't have it in my ear all of the time. It might get pushed into a pocket at the airport or into a case during a meeting, so then there is a search to find the pieces and put it back together when I need it. The over-the-ear holder (my kids call it a geek-wire) held the headset on really well and gave me that warm secure feeling, but caused the bud to fall off even more often. If it's not convenient for me all the time, I can't use it.Make this a little tougher and I'm in. Right now, I'm looking for something more rugged."
3,ok headset,this headset is one of the best fitting headset I have ever had however the ear jels come off easy I almost lost it a few times. Sounds great on your end but others hear too much background noise even with the DSP chip. I swithed to the JAWBONE headset it is great
2,Poor Signal and battery life,"Not happy with this unit, do not recommend it. Unit does not work if you hold your phone in your right hand while headset is in left ear. Very poor reception; needed to place cell phone in left shirt pocket during calls. Very short battery life, perhaps 45 minutes.Bought Jabra at same time, still using it and quite happy with signal quality, battery life, and overall functionality."
4,Best bluetooth headset I've used so far,"The Plantronics Discovery 655 is the best of the three bluetooth headsets I've used so far.Likes:- it's comfortable. I soon forget it's in my ear, and I do not even need the overear support;- it's versatile. I can charge it through USB, adapter plug, or with the AAA battery adapter;- it's usable. The vibrating protector case is a nice touch.- the sound quality is great, even better than some of the code earphones I've used.Dislikes:- there is an delay in answering. I do not know if this is a configuration issue (I'm using it with a blackberry), but there is a two second pause before the headset will answer. Still trying to figure this one out. If not for this, I'd give it five stars.Highly recommended."
1,Dissapointed,"Living in New York City I wanted a blutooth headset that would seal out all the noise while walking in the streets. The plantronics Discovery headset I thought would do the trick since it fits directly in your ear canal, unfortunately after trying each of thge 3 fitted ear tips provided I always had the same problem, ""THE HEADSET WOULD ALWAYS FALL OUT"" . I tried attaching the supplied ear hook but that was so uncomfortable that i decided to return the headset and try something else."
2,"Looks great, but","Pros- Its VERY small and light, can't even tell its onCons- I own a Treo 650 and the headset crackled a LOT, if I held the phone face down, with phone on a table it worked ok, but on belt or even on other side of my body from ear, not good- Could never get the USB charger to work, plus you need this special little nub to attach to the ""cradle"" of the headset to charge with USB, vs plugging it into the wall, this little nub VERY easy to lose, why they couldn't make the wall charger and the USB plug use the same attachment I dont know- I bought this thing, and WAITED a long time, because it came with a case/protectice cradle, well it turns out that the case does not protect the key component, the rubbery nub that goes into your ear, I wanted something I could place in my pocket withouth having to worry about breakage, no help there"
3,Good life,You have to be carefull not to over charge your unit. I first bought them in the year 2000. don't remember I bought the last one. But I got 12 years out of the 2 of them
3,Okay but....,The battery life is disappointing and thus defeats the whole intention of going 'hands-free'. The sound quality was good but only up to the point of having battery-time.
2,Poor Ear Fit,"The device has fairly good reception, but poor ear support. It doesn't stay in. The connecting ear support clip doesn't stay put and the ear covers wer too big."
1,Only good for a few people,"I bought this headset based on positive reviews posted here. For me, it is one of the worst headsets I have ever owned. It comes with three ear tips, none of which fit my ears well at all. Because leaving it in my ear was chancy at best, I used the provided over-ear clip. It's a total disaster. The clip mounts over the post used to hold the ear tip. Any pressure applied to the headset, such as removing it from an ear, often results in the clip forcing the ear tip free. It is no fun trying to retrieve the components in an automobile or anywhere else.Avoid this badly engineered product."
3,Sorta nice but with problems,"I think the things that I did not like the best for this unit was that the earloop and the ear gels come loose readily, particularly if you do not keep the gel turned to one side or the other. I lost the gels twice when they came out unexpectantly. I also lost the unit twice when the earloop grabbed onto something and was pulled from my pocket. Unfortunately, the last time it was lost for good. One other thing about the gels, is that I never felt comfortable with them, and I tried a couple sizes.As far as sound quality, it was usually decent; but I noticed a popping with some phone calls. I never could figure out what caused the popping.I liked the ease of charging it and pairing was particularly easy. I particularly liked the ability to charge it from a battery in case of emergency. Speaking of battery life, I found it needed to be charged pretty much every day to make sure that it was ready when I needed it."
3,quality deteriorates quickly,"I bought a Discovery 655 because a co-worker raved about it. I've had a long list of headsets bluetooth and wired and always found the wired to be vastly superior (if not as convenient). This new 655 from Plantronics was great at first and I bought a second one for my wife, but a couple of months after using it, I'm getting more and more complaints from people on the other end of the phone that they can't hear me and I'm breaking up. At first it seemed like it only happened when the batter was low (the batter life on this unit isn't fantastic), but now it seems to happen all the time and my wife's has started doing the same. So, while I was a happy customer at first, I'm now at a point where I basically can't use the unit any longer."
3,"Not bad, but not the best one","Very good sound quality plus very cool design.Cons: DSP doesn't help too much, double click doesn't work on my new Nokia 6133, it dials numbers... at random. Poor battery life (I have the old nokia headset and it holds battery much longer)."
4,Comfort with good sound and performance,"Amazon sent me an early production model that was repackaged from a previous return because the unit did not work well. I called Plantronics who promptly replaced the headset with a new updated model(it has the same model number). The headset is probably the best one I have used. It is comfortable to wear especially with the thin ""hook"" that goes around the ear. The sound is acceptable. Acceptable is the highest rating I can give it because BlueTooth will never be excellent, hence 4 stars. I keep all the parts that the headset comes with in a little pouch in my car. I keep the A/C charger in the primary place where I usually charge the headset. I also tend to keep the shirt pocket holder attached to the charger. I only take the holder with me if I am going to be away overnight. The charger usually goes with me too. I never had to make decisions about where to keep ""parts"" to a Bluetooth headset before but it's worth it, I think."
4,Works great with Treo 700w,Tried many and the only ones i like are this and the jabra jx10. I own both and use this more because i dont have to use the earloop and can stick in my pocket. I guess it is phone specific.
1,It didn't work out of the box.,The Plantronics 655 Bluetooth Headset did not work out of the box. Now I get to go through warranty to exchange it. Consider yourself warned.
1,DEAD,"Product arrived promptly, but this item arrived DEAD. Unable to charge, pair, or use at all. So far the shipper is willing to refund the cost. May just be this one DEAD, I do not know."
4,good but not great,"the sound quality is good both ways but the only thing that I'm not happy with is that when you put your phone in your pocket, it starts crackling a little bit and sometimes you have to hold your phone close to the unit or place the phone directly in front of you. Reception could be improved but its still a good unit. Good, sturdy design and better than some others. Ear Gel needs to be replaced every few months, I found that the small size fits me well and I don't have small ears. The small size allows me to stick it in my Ear like an in ear earphone. It picks up slight wind noise and the noise canceling is really not that great. Sounds good in the car as long as you have your windows rolled up. overall not bad and I use it everyday. it does the job and people don't even know I have it on."
2,Its good for now,"The ear piece always pops off when I put the ear hook on. I had to send the first one back because it wouldn't turn off. I have the replacement, and still have the ear hook issue, and it doesn't stay in my ear without it. I'll be buying another bluetooth, but this will do for the time between ordering."
2,"Great headset, but AWFUL battery life","I got this headset and loved it right away. The look was so sleek, and it was light and comfortable, easy to use. HOWEVER, the battery life was just awful. I would use it for 45 mins in the morning, and maybe 30mins throughout the day, and by afternoon, it was dead. The travel/pen charger is not very practical if you need the piece on your ear all the time. And a AAA battery doesn't seem to charge it very well. A shame - it's a great headset and I would have loved to keep it. But it just didn't cut it. I ended up returning this headset. Amazon was great with the RMA process - that's why I shop Amazon - they'll take care of the consumer."
5,The Buck ($) stops here with Plantronics.,I've had great results with Plantronics. And this is coming from someone that has used three other companies. The sound quality is great. The volume control is excellent. The gel earbud fits easily and is quitecomfortable to my suprise. Being able to charge the headset when away from an outlet is brilliant. Plantronics is far ahead of the game and my buck stops here!!
1,No one could hear me,"I was very excited to get this - it paired with my Verizon phone easily, it was incredibly comfortable in my ear, and I could hear everyone more clearly than I ever could on corded ear pieces. The problem is that no one could hear me. I sounded like I was talking from a wind tunnel every time. I'm unfortunately returning it tonight. I'm still high on bluetooth technology, but now I'll have to try a different model."
2,I wanted to like this item...,"But it's performance really disappointed me. I have 3 Plantronic DSP 500 headsets, for different computers, that I LOVE. This product is nothing like those. Granted, they serve different purposes, but still. If I have my phone clipped at my waist on the right, and wear this headset in my left ear, I lose my connection. I'm a big guy, but hell, I'm not THAT big. The ONLY time I seem to keep a connection to it is when I clip my phone (LG VX8300) on my Truck's driver-side sun-visor & wear the headset. Even then it sporadically drops the connection. We're talking less than 2 feet here. I've had this thing for about 3 weeks now, but I think I'm going to have to take the loss & return it. Maybe I got a bad unit, who knows. I really did want to like this thing. It does look nice. I'll give them that. But I need a little more than that unfortunately."
4,Bluetooth rating,"The Plantronics bluetooth works well, has good sound quality and is very comfortable to wear. The battery charger and USB cable for charging are great, especially for business travel."
1,Utterly horrible,"This is the worst bluetooth earpiece I've ever owned. It doesn't stay in your ear unless you use the loop, and the loop is poorly designed. It is anchored to the headset by the ear-piece, with a very loose fitting snapping mechanism. So every time you take this off and put it in your pocket or case, the ear piece and loop fall off. I am already looking for a replacement."
3,Great earpiece but.......,"Great head piece light and after a few minutes you forget its in your ear. Sound is great but for the other party listening, they pick up everything. Noise canceling is minimal and ear volume could be just a little higher. My final point if its going to be used indoors its perfect, but for noisy sittuations not good at all and don't get caught outside on a windy day."
2,Earbud piece breaks easily,"I got about 6 months use out of this. I went through all 3 supplied gel earbud pieces because they break easily. The buds snap and lock into place but the cheap plastic that the tiny tiny ""locking tabs"" are made of, wear out and break. Once that happens the ear hook that also attaches to the base of the earbuds then falls off without it, making it useless.Also, I seemed to get more ""noise"" and more ""muffled"" sound (although pretty loud) than with my previous earpiece of the same make but earlier model.The only reason I gave it even 2 stars is because it was comfortable to wear (before it broke) and also for all the cool different charger options that it came with it.I just ordered yet a newer version of this bluetooth earpiece. We shall see..."
3,Broken but all not Lost,"the G55 I purchased came out the brand new box... without being able to charge. just the headset it self seem to be malfunctioning. I have Great news though I do have a warranty and am in process of using it. That is not the best yet, the Plantronics Discovery 655 has been discontinued so the Company is sending me the upgraded 665. Idk if that is good or bad but upgrades do sound pleasing. just hope the headset itself will satisfy my needs."
2,Blutooth-Plantronics Discovery,"Disappointed with the quality of this device. Although price was good, it really doesn't matter if people on the other end of the phone call complain of background noise, static, etc. Would not reccommend."
1,Very disappointed,"Was very disappointed with this product. I paid a good price for this and it worked no better than one I paid much less for. Basically it picked up too much background noise and people on the other end could not hear me well. I've gone back the ""wired"" headset that came with my blackberry and this works best, just a bit of a pain around the set belt of the car...."
4,Great sound quality and functionality - Little uncomfortable though...,"Great headset, just not the most comfortable due to the inside the ear design."
1,"unhappy, should have decided differently","When I received the bluetooth, everything was ok. A few days later it began to act a bit weird. I have problems trying to connect my phone and the earpiece together, the sound is distorted at times, the earpiece will not come on to become discoverable, and it has knocked out the sound for my speakers on my phone, I had to do a master reset. I probably will purchase another brand next time around."
3,Good and Bad,The 655 fits well in the ear. I prefer the ear loop that wraps around your ear. The rubber piece that goes into your ear and the ear wrap is easy to separate. This is not good if you store you ear piece in you pocket. Sound quality is great.
1,Very frustrating and time consuming,When I originally obtained the headset it took a while to enable. After enabling it worked fine on my end for several weeks. During this time I did get feedback that connection sound was like I was talking from a hole in the ground. Then I experienced the device enabled but not working. I have messed with it several times and can't get it to function at all.
2,"Picture of 3, but you Only get 1!","Be careful because there is a picture of 3 bars of soap, but I only got one! 3 bars is a great deal, but one is not so good."
3,Good soap but,The product is great and we would like to keep buying it but the cost of shipping is so high that we will look for a better way to obtain the product.
3,Great for Beginners,"This book is great for beginners. If you don't know anything about programming, this is a great place to start. It explains the basics well, but typos can be distracting at times and you will need another book for more in-depth topics."
2,Richter's Opinion,"I just thought I would point out that Sviatoslav Richter, the pianist in this recording of the triple concerto, thought that this was an absolutely awful recording."
2,"Alas, the major item is a terrifble flop and disowned by the performer.","When big names made a big blunder in recording - that is Beethoven's Triple Concerto under the baton of the legendary conductor Herbert von Karajan, and the three great Russian instrumentalists.For the Beethoven, you might as well have one recorded in four separate sessions, and amalgamated technically afterwards. That's how computer piano playings sound these days in some 'cheap' restaurants.Enough said - S. Richter 'disowned' this recording afterwards.If one but have ears, you would hear how disinterested the playing by the three soloists were, and how far away from real musicality work this is!If they reduce the price sufficiently, there may still remain a reason to get this JUST for the Brahms Double Concerto, though."
3,Great Brahms and the artists stumble in the Beethoven,"Of course, all three soloists are amazing artists. Szell does a splendid job working with them. I am among those who nearly always find Szell's work outstanding, and this is no exception. The Beethoven should have been just as great, but the group just doesn't work well together. Maybe Karajan is to blame. He could turn in performances that sounded very ""manufactured""--the sound is ""managed,"" everything is glossy and smooth, and it comes across as seriously lacking in feeling for the values of the music. The triple concerto was listed among the 20 worst recordings or all times in the often amusing ""The Life and Death of Classical Music: Featuring the 100 Best and 20 Worst Recordings Ever Made."" Richter is quoted there as saying he hated the recording, but he was a pretty gloomy fellow."
1,I don't care what you think...Worst Triple EVER,"...I'll just say that no matter how big names are, this triple concerto sucks.I abhor it (although I'm a big fan of Karajan, Oistrakh, Richter and Rostropovich INDIVIDUALLY)...The whole team screwed up big time on these sessions from the sonics to the interpretations. Just compare this triple to Fricsay's spectacular version on DG...it's like light versus darkness.******5 stars for the best stereo Brahms Double!"
5,Brahms - Double Concerto,"It's interesting that there are quite a number of negative comments about this performance of the Beethoven here. I didn't dislike it, but it is true that I almost always jump straight to the Brahms' Double Concerto. The piece and the performance are beyond praise, quite frankly.The same could be said of David Oistrakh. I know of nobody who can play Brahms and Beethoven as this Russian genius does: his performances of the violin concertos are -- adjective defying...Do have a look at Oistrakh's performaces of Beethoven's violin concerto, either with Cluytens (perhaps not available now) or in the easily got hold of disc on Testament (Erhling). For the Brahms violin concerto there is also the other CD from EMI with Otto Klemperer from 1960, which is also great (but not a patch on this one. It does, howver an amazing performance of the Sinfonia Concertante, with Igor Oistrakh which is the stand-out performance on the CD.)"
1,Simply bad.,"There is a good reason why this recording can be had new for seven dollars and change while the Bruno Walter reissue costs sixty bucks. This Triple is just plain awful. Neither Corigliano, Rose nor Hendl have one tenth the stature of the giants on this recording but guess what? They know how to play together. And HvK? He has no clue."
2,A General Guide To Online Learning With Little Specific Information,"""Peterson's Guide to Online Learning"" is a brief, general guide to the concepts associated with online learning and Internet-only degree programs. The book is now several years old, and in an environment that changes so swiftly, always make sure you verify the currency of the information presented. The information is of a very general nature and is of nearly no help to anyone with any previous exposure to online education. It is not a resource book of different schools and programs, but is a guide for the novice addressing various subjects with chapters such as ""How Teachers Teach Online"" and ""How You Interact Online."" It's pretty basic stuff.I can't recommend this book in general, with one caveat: if you are interested in online education and have absolutely no understanding of the processes involved, this might be a useful first book for you. The rudimentary nature of the book makes it of marginal or no use to anyone else."
1,Unsafe product,"I picked this thing up on a whim to use as a letter opener. I wasn't expecting quality along the lines of my Benchmades, Gerbers, and Kershaws. Even with light duty use as a letter opener, the locking mechanism died. The blade is now loose and the blade can easily come back and bite you.Your safety is worth more than saving a few bucks. Get something better."
4,Interesting mindblowing artefact,"This album -recorded in '73 - was never released although both the songwriting and the musicianship is top-notch. Unfortunately the sound is a bit on the murky side, probably transfered from a (good) copy rather than master tapes.Fine well-played psychedelia with some proggish moments. Heavy wah guitar,dreamy lyrics (""Let my guitar speak for me/that's how much I love you all"")and also moments of very British quirkiness a la Syd Barett or Incredible String BandAll in all this make for some classic and timeless psychedelic and could very well be taken as an release from one of the many brilliant retro bands around."
1,"Alas, the poo is extra-stinky","We switched to Instinct dry from Evo because it has just as much protien but costs about $12 less per bag. When you buy as much cat food as we do (we breed Maine Coons) that adds up!Well, we used Instinct for several months and the cats really liked it. During this same time period we started having problems with loose stools and poo that smelled extra-noxious. Seriously, when one of the cats would go it was as if an entire football team farted in our living room. We thought maybe we had gotten giardia in the house, but the tests came back clean.Finally, we put two and two together and tried switching back to Evo dry. Within a day the cat poo odor dropped to a normal level of stink.You may not have this same problem with your cats, but I'll spend the extra money on Evo, thank you."
4,Good product,"After seeing all the pet food recalls and reading about all the crap they put in most commercial pet ""food"", I decided to look for a natural product. Cats are carnivores, and they need more protein and less carbohydrates than most brands offer. My cat eats this dry food, no problem.Edit: Note the item reviewed is the Instinct variety of this food, not the Prairie version depicted. The difference is Instinct is grain-free. I got a 4.4 lb bag at a local store for $13, so a 12-lb bag for $31 is a good deal."
2,"Oh, the humanity!","My cat devoured this food! But there comes a time when that which is devoured... Must be de-devoured.... If you know what I'm sellin... I live in a larger 1bedroom apt. and she lit the entire 930 sq feet up with a stench that would have a wet nurse running out of the house... She has never, nor has any baby ever let this kind of raunch out of its body. I just can't take it! Awful! The entire apartment gets raunched, funktified.Currently, she's looking up at me with these innocent eyes, and in my head I hear in a Steve Erkel voice ""Did I do that!?"""
2,Not so much,I tried this food for several months but it made my cats throw up. They lost weight so switched back to Kirkland brand.
2,My 15 year old cat won't touch this food,"Bought a bag of this, hoping to get my cat away from the grains, rotten meat and other garbage in most commercial cat food. My cat has never been finicky, but she wants nothing to do with this food. I even tried another reviewer's idea of putting the food through the food processor with a bit of water, but the cat smelled it and still didn't want it. The search for a better cat food product continues. I gave it 2 stars only because it's a cat-health conscious product, but maybe it should be 1 star since my cat won't eat it."
2,Unwilling Substitute for Wellness Core,"My 2 Turkish Van kitties usually eat Wellness Core w/ no grain, but when they were due for a new bag Amazon was out of stock and I would have had to pay shipping, not to mention wait much longer to receive it, so I looked for something similar as a substitute.Long story short, my cats hate this food... even the female. They barely touch their bowls and would rather go hungry than eat it. I've been mixing it in with some wet food that I have so they'll acquire a taste for it. As many cat lovers know, Vans are very vocal. So they've been whining and crying about the food even with full dishes. Essentially indicating, ""We want our old food back!""I will be sticking to Wellness Core. I do not recommend it to owners with picky kitties."
1,Cat refuses to eat this food!,"I was really excited to find a grain free food that was fairly affordable. Unfortunately, my cat will not touch this stuff! In fact my other cat that does not have grain issues won't eat it either. I think some of it has to do with the fairly large, square shape of the kibble. It is almost like dog food. Other than that it is the taste. The only way I can get my cat to eat this food is to put it through the food processor to break up the large pieces and douse it with water to make it seem like wet food. (My cat has always eaten dry food so it is not a dry/wet issue). By the way, although this food says it is grain free, it does still have grain in its ingredients. This is really deceiving and I am not sure why they are able to label this food as grain free. This purchase was a total waste of money and I will look for another brand and hope that my cat will eat it without the need to doctor it."
2,My cats don't like it,I have four cats. They always love dry food. But now they only eat it when they are very very hungry.
4,"Great for puzzle game fans, but not for everyone","I am a puzzle game fanatic. From Tetris to PoyoPop to Kirbii No Kira Kira Kizzu (only released in japan). My three favorites are Meteos, Panal de PonPon (Puzzle League), and Dr.Mario. This game has the later two. This pack is a real deal. two of the gratest puzzle games of all time in one pack. they have no story though. some people arent into puzzle games. i love puzzle games because they give me a challenge. if you like challanges you will love this. Puzzle League contains many modes of play Including puzzle , garbage (a mode that you have to get rid of certain blocks before the pile up too high), and time attack. this game is defenitly woth a rent. then decide if you want to buy it."
1,Wrong color,"The rug was a different color then what I ordered. It was supposed to be blue, light blue, pink, ivory. Instead it was blue, dark blue, off-white/lt. grey and gold/brown. Would have liked to have just exchange it for the correct color but Amazon policy will not allow for the ""same"" area rug to be exchanged in the shopping cart.I did order another area rug for a different room ( http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002KA5TK4/ref=pe_175190_21431760_M3T1_ST1_dp_1) and it is exactly the correct color and matches the thumbnail provided.Never had a problem before with any orders I've had before this. A little disappointed..."
3,Three Stars and Half,"This is a true psych Holy Grail.The expense and rarity of the album built quite a mystique.However, it is NOT a firestorming psych guitar album, other than opening song: 'Jug A Jug' which is a fine Hendrixian wailer. After the opening track it is an amiable and very atmospheric, lazy afternoon, blues rock (Hendrix) influenced album, but NOT much guitar wailing. A few of the songs feature 'Little Wing' like chording with vocals that are kinda like Robert Wyatt and a growl-less JJ Cale. Lyrical content touches on Eastern religious sentiments."
3,difficult listening,"You gotta give Art Blakey credit for putting out an album like this (actually, it was originally released as two separate albums), but as the other reviewer noted, it sure ain't the Jazz Messengers. Poly-rhythms galore, as the bongos, drums, gongs, congas, maracas, timbales, and more bongos and more drums pound away. And oh yeah, somenoe plays ""tree log"" too. It's a welcome relief when Donald Byrd shows up on a few tracks to play a bit of trumpet and Ray Bryant tickles the piano keys in the background. Not a bad album, but I found it to be a difficult listening experience. But if you're in the right frame of mind, and don't mind LOTS of trippy bongo playing, this might be of interest to you."
5,Fast and easy,"Istallation from CD took less then 1 minute (W7 64) worked on both ultrabooks I own, no further configuration was required."
1,Doesn't work,Doesn't work even after installing the driver. Tried it on couple of systems(laptop and desktop). Planning to return to MFG.
2,The book is a decent depiction of Carey's life.,"As a student at William Carey College in Hattiesburg, MS, I had to read this book for my honors English class. The book gives a lot of information about Carey, but does more telling than showing. It does not make the reader connect with the story. It is a chore to read. The author includes too much irrelevant detail, and his writing style leaves much to be considered. Very boring. Overuse of cliches. I have been informed that it will not be part of the curriculum for the class next year. I recommend trying to find another source."
2,Not a bit of spirit of the masterpiece,"Did anyone heard about the story how Handel GF wrote this masterpiece. If anyone would like to experience how did writing such a music dramatically changed Mr. Handel's life, you probably do not want this record. This record never renders any glory of the Messiah whom Handel was singing about and Handel's worship to him which he imbued in this oratorio."
5,Great Book,"Great Book. I'm new to New Mexico and this book came highly recommended. I purchased it and was not disappointed. I recommend it to anyone not familiar with New Mexico gardening. It is easy to read,shows all the pertinent information that I was looking for."
4,Good.,"My only problem is that I have trouble trying to get on the game screen. Besides that, I love it."
2,It was just so so,It's an ok book - the pictures are pretty - but I honestly haven't even been inspired to read it - it's more just for looking at
3,The title can be read two ways,I bought this for my mother-in-law as a birthday gift - read into that what you will.
5,Ahhh! Time to rest!,Aren't we all over doing it just a little? Don't we all need to slow down and see the important things in life? This book is a gem. It's a fabulous reminder to take it easy and to appreciate the small things in life.
4,Great coffee table book,A beautifully laid out book that is a good reminder that we should all slow down. Reading the book and looking at the pictures just makes you want to kick up your feet and relax.
4,A wake up call to slow down,"Received this book from my sister for Christmas. It serves as a timely reminder to cherish ourselves and our time alone. Too often we equate solitude or ""down time"" with unproductiveness...this book points out that we need to cultivate our relationship with ourselves first. It's filled with ideas (some practical, some not so) on how to be good to yourself. Great ""tub reading""--don't forget the bubbles, candles, and beverage of your choice!"
2,The Art of Using a Thesaurus,"The author makes a pointed effort of using a tiring collection of little used eight letter words...in combination. End result: endless, rambling sentences. The content is quite dull and uninspiring. Exasperating considering I expected this piece to be a beautiful, pleasant read. To follow the author's recommendation, one must reside near a surplus of speciality and gourmet shops. For those of us in the middle to lower economic range, try a fragrant bubble bath from a local dollar store, lock yourself in the bathroom and listen to music.The photographer is to be commended for her artistic talent. Although, as a heterosexual female, I would have much prefered a picture of a naked man floating in a pond to that of a naked woman!The Art of Doing Nothing is worth...nothing. Not your time nor your money."
1,A really strange book???,"I purchased this book in conjunction with ""The Art of Imperfection"" - and was completely disappointed with both books. This one particularly was, how shall I say, strange? I was expecting to get something out of this book and received nothing. No mind-opening statements, no inspiration, nothing. I wouldn't waste my money again."
4,If you don't want to see the usual stuff....,"Realist, gritty, strong, disturbing, provocative, thoughtful, creative well made film about the journey of despair and hope. Characters and situations are multidimensional and therefore real. Violence is not gratuitous but has a purpose. Creative use of audio. Good film that may not appeal to a huge audience. Popularity does not necessarily make a good film."
1,"This ""movie"" is comparable to stepping in dog doo-doo","Couldn't even make it to 15 mins. Hated the characters, hated the theme, hated the feel. ""Gritty""? Nah...missed it by a mile. Annoying, like stepping in dog foo-doo."
5,Learn SQL Server 2K the fun way,"The author really knows how to make the book fun to read. It spares you from the boring, technical parts and concentrates on the more, interesting and useful applications of SQL Server 2K, though it does feel like a book for kids after a while. The author shows his sense of humour along the way, making you laugh every now and then, which is good! :)The book goes through most, but not all the functionalities of SQL Server and brings you through building a SpyNet database. It even has a chapter on building the frontend with ASP, though it doesn't teach you any ASP and assumes that you either know ASP already or can make sense out of the comments he wrote together with the ASP scripts. The book touches only the surface of SQL Server concepts and thus is great for beginners wanting to start doing something with SQL Server, but not so appropriate for professionals.Highly recommended for beginners."
5,Great Background music,"I'm a longtime Star Wars fan, as well as a jazz enthusiastic. The release of episode III has given me the perfect excuse to throw a Star Wars Themed party, and I bought this cd only for it. I'd heard the previews on this page, and I thought it was excellent for background while playing a little Star Wars Monopoly... I know not everybody will like this album, but I personally do. The Imperial March, The Cantina Band and Yoda's Theme are great."
2,"Buy the real things, not this.","If you want the actual Star Wars scores by John Williams, I recommend:Star Wars: A New Hope / 2 CD set (Sony Classical, available September 2004)The Empire Strikes Back / 2 CD set (Sony Classical, available September 2004)Return of the Jedi / 2 CD set (Sony Classical, available September 2004)Star Wars: A New Hope Special Edition / 2 CD set (RCA/Victor)The Empire Strikes Back Special Edition / 2 CD set (RCA/Victor)Return of the Jedi Special Edition / 2 CD set (RCA/Victor)The Star Wars Trilogy Anthology / 4 CD set (Arista/20th Century Fox)Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace CD (Sony Classical)Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace The Ultimate Edition / 2 CD set (Sony Classical)Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones (Sony Classical)Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith (Sony Classical, available May 2005)PLEASE do not buy this drivel unless you alreday have the above CDs and you HAVE to have everything."
4,Great primer on how to glue the web and PR together,Plenty of ideas and lots of examples splatter each chapter. You need to make sure you don't become gidy with what can be done especially when you start counting up the resources needed.
2,What happened with this?,"I love the Emprire Brass! However, this is the worst of their CDs that I own (and that number stands at nine). The previous review faulting the mixing is right on. The percussion was obviously recorded elsewhere and in no way blends in with the ensemble. Several pieces are percussion with Empire Brass serving as the accompaniment. The mix sounds like it was done by a High School percussionist. I love brass, but this CD will see little play by me. Too many discs by Empire Brass and other artists that are worth listening to over this one."
2,Dreadful,"I read the sharply mixed reviews before purchasing this CD, opting to trust those who raved about the disc over those who had panned it. My mistake! I found most of the arrangements bizarre and unpleasant. This CD is going with me on my next trip to the thrift store."
3,Only One brush.,"The description says brushes but this only includes one. Great quality, with the handle and bristles, but not expected at all."
3,good exposure,"This review book is good for exposure to alot of different questions. There are a few errors in both the text and the CD-ROM. There are a few questions with miskeyed answer choices but correct rationales, but there are also a few mistyped or misworded questions. This review is good for exposure to alot of questions, and quick rationales (with references to texts), and the CD-ROM is formatted much like the computer testing is set up. My suggestion is if you feel that a question is answered erroneously, look it up, you may be right."
2,Quality Questions- but several errors in CD-ROM,"I purchased this book in June of 2000 from Amazon.com. I've been told the more questions you are exposed to, the better you get at answering them. The book and CD provided a nice variety of questions, with brief rationale for correct answers, but be careful of the CD-ROM. In several instances, the answers were incorrectly programmed. It hasn't been the best review I've seen, but it is one of the few with a CD-ROM."
4,Fun for my 9 years old boy.,"I got it for my son to compete with his other electronic games.I am really pleased that he likes it a lot. There are a lot of neatlittle features on the castle that he plays with. He will stayin his room for hours to play with this set. We also got the other knight' castle (the red one, forgot the name) to complete the set.Definitely a solid good quality toy that doesn't fall apart easily.The castle design is quite intricate but strong."
4,Medieval life,This Playmobil castle follows a tradition we started with our daughter and that we are passing on to her children. The boys have had great fun discovering the intricate details provided by Playmobil. Their interest will grow along with them. We cannot wait for the production of the Egyptian theme.
3,Improved Lighting,"I often ride my motorcycle at night; but, always had a hard time seeing what was out in front of me. A friend recommended installing the Silver Star so I did. I can't say it improved the light output to that of a car; but, it has improved enough that I would recommend it as a replacement for the original bulb."
2,"Great bulb, but bad angle of light","I purchased this bulb after reading countless reviews saying it was better than the GE Nighthawk which was what I was deciding between. The bulb was significantly brighter than my stock bulb, but the angle in which the low beam is angled on my 2006 Harley Sportster makes it impossible to see farther than 15 feet in front of me at night. It was quite startled during my first night ride with it.I assume it is a very motorcycle specific problem, but nonetheless I have to find something different, again."
2,Me decepcionó la calidad de este producto.,"Compré estas bombillas esperando fueran tan buenas como indican en la propaganda, pero luego de instalarlas me decepcionaron, la luz que emiten es amarilla y no blanca, aparte de esto compré 3 unidades para guardar una de repuesto, una de las bombillas abriendola de su empaque original viene con uno de los contactos dañados (conector H4) y no funcionó, gracias a esto ultimo perdí $22.00 más el costo del envío.De estos 2 factores es que se deriva mi calificación."
1,Don't buy it!!,"I give this lotion NO STARS!! It's smells awful! To review this, I was prompted to give it a star."
1,Very Unsatisfied,"I've tried the body wash and the body spray. Since I could rave endlessly about how wonderful they smell, I naturally assumed the lotion would smell just as good. I couldn't have been more wrong. It smells like...a generic drugstore lotion with a very faint hint of cotton candy. I cannot stress how faint that undertone is. Inhaling as deeply as you can, you almost can't catch it because that 'lotion' smell almost completely masks it. Aside from the scent, the consistency is very unappealing. It's very runny and feels similar to mucous or something of the like.0/5 stars, if it were possible."
3,not heavy candy smell,didnt have a big cotton candy smell and watery liquid came out at first i shook it very well and it got somewhat better its a white color lotion not pink as i expected but still fine.
2,Off Scent,Just received this & although it does have a slight cotton candy scent there is also an off scent that I can't recognize. It definitely does not smell as good as the body spray. I'm a little disappointed.
4,"Opportunity Knocked, and Barry Delivered","I have the movie and am a big fan of soundtracks, what Barry did is capture the largest mammal ever to walk upon the earth and bring it into a decent score. This ain't Oscar material, but for a fan of movie monsters and soundtracks, I would do what I have to in order to get this CD! The opening is just huge, not to hard, but heavy in volume."
1,"Not a true leather, it is a laminate with a composite core:","I bought this belt from Amazon using the info given that the belt was of true leather. IT IS NOT! It is a composite inside a leather laminate, it is a fake.As with most all belts that are made this way, the edge of the belt has already got a break in it from normal use. The buckle holes are already torn to shreds, being ripped out by nothing more than normal use, i.e., using the belt as a belt! I wouldn't not reccommend this product to anyone.It is to late for me to return the belt to Amazon for a refund, but I will never buy another belt from this site, especially one advertised as LEATHER!The belt is less than 6 months old!Such a bummer."
4,size44,"Great item , Good quality but the belt is not true to size it seems a little smaller. If you usually wear 38"" in belts you should buy a size 40"""
1,Particle board and chipped paint...,"When I first opened this toy for my son I noticed it was really light weight. It feels like hallow plastic. After about a week I noticed the paint chipping on some of the peices, under the paint was not wood at all but particle board.Here is what wikipedia has to say about particle board:""...concern is with the release of formaldehyde... a small amount of emission occurs dueto decomposition of the resin.""My son is 2 and still puts toys in his mouth. I hate the thought of him chewing on particle board made with formaldehyde.Also the toys are flat and light weight, hard to stand up and fall over easily. My son would try and play with them like a normal toy, but the peices would just fall over like a domino affect."
5,Spare Cord,The cord is fine I got a second cord to permanently mount in my router table and the other one is for free-handing. Nice to have the table cord installed with cord clamps so it is totally out of the way just enough slack to remove the router lift.
2,Games,"I expected a booklet where all the 2,3,4,5, etc. letter words are listed.It has some listings, but I used to have another booklet and I cannot find it anymore.I guess I should have read the description better, before I ordered it."
5,I need all the help I can get...,"This book gives great tips on Scrabble strategy, very comprehensive. It has been a big help and I have been winning more."
5,"If you love Scrabble, get this book.","""Everything Scrabble"" lives up to its title. I purchased this book for lists of words using difficult letters. Then I discovered strategies, letter combinations, opportunities to look for on the the gameboard, and more to become a much stronger player. If you are a beginner or just tired of being outplayed, this book will help."
3,it's ok,"the book is ok, if you're a big scrabble fan, it's not horrible, but the most i got out of it was a list of 2 letter words. one would probably be better off spending the money on the scrabble dictionary instead."
3,GOOD BUT OUT OF DATE,"The authors need to update this work. It still uses the words contained in OSWD 3. Anyone playing with a OSWD 4 knows that words like ""Qi"" and ""Ki"" are permissable and this edition of EVERYTHING SCRABBLE doesn't take that into account, so anyone using this version will be at a great disadvantage."
4,Mudge boy Review on Amazon,the Mudge boy is a story of a boy who is apparently a little slow and want to be friends with the so called normal kids and meet up with an older boy who apparently has problems with his sexuality due to the abuse brought on by his father and takes it our on this young boy who it totally in the dark about things and has a strange attachment to his late mother doing strange things with chickens and it is apparent that the older boy has sexual feeling for the boy and wants no one to know when he finally let loose and rapes the young boy you know he has problems a must see film if anyone wants to know about country boys.
4,Kind of a Dark Movie - Gay Undertone,"Its a movie about a boy who is somewhat antisocial who ends up being rapped by his ""friend""I bought the movie because I like Emile Hirsch and if you are gay and like gay undertone movies, this is one for you."
2,not as great as i thought,in the whole movie this guy (the guy on the cover) puts a chicken head i believe it is in his head. i thought that there would be a nude scene in it at least once none. the 2 boys are kinda lame.
2,Not as promising as I thought,"The story of a young farm boy who recently lost his mom basically falls for a friend of his who's another farm boy in the same location. It showed promise in the beginning but it honestly failed way short of a decent movie. The relationship between the main charachter and his friend should have been able to deepen a bit more especially after what his friend did to him toward the latter part of the movie. But by the time the relationship finally came to abroad, the movie was over and you were left wondering what was to come. As a TV show, this would have been a good show to watch since you'd be tailhooked into watching what was to happen next week. As a movie however, it was definately not worth it."
3,Chickens,"*Spoiler Alert*Plot of the Mudge Boy- Duncan lives on a farm.. the kid loses his mom when she falls off a bike one day. He loves chickens and raises chickens on a farm. He makes his chicken his best friend and carries him around everywhere he goes. He meets a group of friends and this one guy who he develops a crush on. The guy has interest in him too but continually denies it and acts like he hates ''gays'' but then tries to do something to Duncan 'the mudge boy' and succeeds. Soon hes after Duncan and they confront him outside their truck and he does 'something' shocking- THE END.Thats basically it. It had atmosphere, it was decent to watch but very odd and the ending leaves you like, what?"
2,"Sad, depressing, dreary, disturbing, even horrifying","Not much more I can add to my review title; that pretty much says it all. Although, I will admit the actors did a very good job. I'm sorry I watched this movie, and can guarantee I won't watch it again.If you enjoy sad and depressing movies that are even a little creepy, you'll love this movie."
4,Emile is incredible,"This was an indie film that I had never heard of before. I have always loved Emile's work, i think think that he is a phenomenal actor, so I decided to give this one a try, I purchased it and instantly liked the movie, it is an interesting film. Really did enjoy it....."
3,Bogged down in Mudge,There is a good story buried in this movie but you have to be very patient while a lot of slow moving and boring scenes go by.
1,SAVE THE MONEY,"Not worth it. Really slow, confusing, weird. I found myself saying ""Huh?"", """"How'd this happen?"" DOnt waste your money on this movie"
5,Very Good,This is a very worthwhile book that will help the reader understand scripture as it is intended to be understood.
2,Poor Kindle version of a great book,Several Kindle books that I have purchased over the years have the same problem that this book has - no table of contents. This is not significant when reading a novel but when trying to read a weightier book it becomes a significant disadvantage. A table of contents provides the reader with the basic structure of the book which reveals how the author intends to present his/her ideas. When that framework (the table of contents) is absent it is impossible for the reader to see the big picture and hence how the material fits in the big picture. Until the Kindle version of this book includes a table of contents you would be better served to buy the print version!!!
3,Purchase advisedly,"Very scholarly and probably good for a seminary student; for the average Bible student, it's a bit esoteric, although the principles are sound. I do believe the principles could have been imparted in an easier to understand and certainly shorter fashion."
4,"Great, very helpful!",Great book for those who want to take their bible study to the next level but don't have a college-level religious education. This book is well written and intelligent as well as readable. Highly recommended.
2,Not for the common layperson,"I was assigned this book in a college course and I have to say that it is hard to follow. If its intention is to bridge the gap between the theologist and the layperson, then they need to continue working on the bridge because it definitely isn't finished. I consider myself of at least average intelligence, but this book left me questioning what exactly their point was in almost every chapter. I have learned a few things from reading this book, but it has mostly left me more confused than before I ever read it. I think this book is better suited for those that already have some understanding of biblical theology and the terms involved. It also seems they are trying to lead people into what their interpretation is instead of sticking to teaching you how to make your own interpretation. On the back cover it says ""Several chapters rewritten for better readability."". Um...Fee & Stuart...rewrite the WHOLE book for readability because it still isn't working."
3,How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth,Another book that was required for a course. Another book that would not otherwise have been purchased. Content was OK. It contained some helpful and insightful information.
3,"Good book, but is it really needed?","This book is not really that bad of a book. Many of its suggested methods are generally good ideas to keep in mind when reading the Bible. However, I have to ask... is such a book like this really needed? This book is really just a technical ""How to read..."" type book. I'd say if most people are actually able to read this book (as it can be a bit academic sometimes), then they are probably perfectly capable of reading the Scriptures and understanding them.Overall though, not a bad book, which contains a few suggestions that will probably profit just about anybody in their own studies. Like one reviewer said though, I can't believe this book is required reading at a Bible college (which is where I had to read it.)"
1,not very good..,i've read many bible outlines and i can say this one isn't any good. i could only read this for an hour.
2,Good in some ways but dichotomistic,"I had to read this book as a requirement for ministry school. It was good as a text for exegesis and Hermeneutics. However, when I got to page 150 I was horrified to find that they made fun of one of my heroes St. Augustine for his interpretation of the good Samaritan. Look this guy wrote the great classic ""City of God""! So what if his interpretation was a little weird. It lines up with scripture.Then there was another thing. The authors said that the Song of Songs was not an allegory of Christ and the Church. It darn well was to the early church fathers! I wanted to throw the book against the wall. However, since it was required reading, I would have had to walk over, pick it up and finish reading it any way."
2,Advertisement for the TNIV,"I was pretty disappointed with the second chapter of this book where good translations like the ESV were almost completely ignored, except to say that it's not feminist like all the other latest translations and therefore not as good as the TNIV. This to me displayed a lack of credibility in chapter 2, and since it sounded like an infomercial for the TNIV (their pet translation), how can I be sure that the authors are not simply espousing their pet hermeneutic in the entirety of this book? As a Bible student, I want an unbiased, historical approach that outlines the methods of a few different traditions within the different streams of orthodox evangelical Christianity, and that at least acknowledges good translations as good -- but this book discouraged readers from using the KJV, ESV, and NASB, whether largely ignoring them or explaining why they are ""inferior""."
2,Disappointing bias,"There is very good information that one can use for learning, studying and understanding scripture. However, the authors' bias on the TNIV is most disappointing. There are much better versions and translations of the Bible available that are closer to the original inspired manuscripts than the much criticized TNIV."
3,It's okay ...,"This is a fairly good book. Fee & Stuart set forth some excellent concepts for studying the Bible. But you have to wade through their prejudices to find the concepts. As pointed out by a former reviewer, they really push the TNIV and NIV translations of the Bible. It's a fine translation, and I use the NIV as a tool for studying, but Fee & Stuart's book begins to read like an NIV commercial ... which gets very old - quick. This does not come as much of a surprise since Gordon Fee (according to Wikipedia) was a ""member of the editorial board"" for the NIV. So, it's my guess that he pushes the NIV for reasons other than scholarly ones.All in all I would recommend the book for its fine insights as long you keep in mind the prejudices that they push."
1,can't believe it is required reading for a Christian University,"This book will do more harm than good, especially if you are searching and/or a new believer in Christianity. I even advised my professor of this and why I felt that this would be considered a stumbling block for growing someone's faith! There was clear evidence of it during interactive discussions within our on-line group. Be careful to read this with an open mind and ask a lot of questions to mature believers when you encounter the authors' opinions, because there are numerous examples of heresy in this book in my opinion. The most disappointing and unnerving thing is that it is required reading for study in entry level Christianity at a Christian university!"
2,Meh,"I had pretty high hopes for this book after reading all the reviews... but you know what? I ended up disagreeing with a lot of this book. I'm somewhat bummed. The title is pretty pretentious but I was hoping that the authors would be on the right track at least, as a lot of Christians do not know what they are reading at times.But I digress, they had comparisons that were silly (comparing parables to jokes just irked me) and they took off on their own opinions with very little to back them up except a ""hope"" they were right. They gave little or no credit to great Christian minds of the past and disregarded a lot of scholarly work.I had to read it for my bible class at a university and I was disappointed. To be fair, I only read a few chapters throughout the book, not all of them."
4,Digging Deeper?,"This book is a great tool for anyone who would like to know more about the bible, and how to make some sense of it. This should be required reading for anyone who teaches the bible at any level, Sunday School Teachers to Senior Pastors. Fee and Stuart break down the study of the biblical texts into easy to understand, yet challenging language. This book is used in both collegiate and graduate level studies, and it is great that it is!You really can't go wrong with this solid text.Joseph Dworak"
4,Great resource,"This book is a great resource for any library. It's not for the faint of heart, though. Fee & Stuart definitely write for students, i.e. for those who really want to explore the depths of Bible study...not just Bible reading. However, those who are interested in Bible reading will find the book insightful, as well."
2,It's an intro book for studing the Bible.,"Fee is a member of the Assemblies of God Church, and it is what he brings to his own style of Hermeneutics that everyone needs to be aware of. Because in chapter 4 and 6 He pushes his theology on you in how he studies the Bible using Acts and 1 Corinthians as his examples. This is an issue that could be considered an conflict or a contradiction to HONEST Hermeneutics. Like He said in the book, everybody brings something to the table when they read the Bible, and He is no exception.It is good for basic bible study, but the flow is sometimes difficult because he doesn't have a polished style of communicating. If you are looking for an intro to Bible study this could work, and he does go into Hermeneutics to a degree, but there are other books out there that are more helpful."
4,Reading the Bible from the Lay person point of view,"I am the leader of a small group and we wanted to do a study on how to read the Bible. I purchased this book for us to use. It is very easy to read, though it may a bit advanced for our needs at times. I look forward to a greater understanding of the Bible!David"
2,Loud popping noise makes it almost unusable!,"I would give it 5 stars if it was not for a very loud popping sound heard whenever buttons are pressed. This is absolutely awful and it makes the adapter almost useless (it is still usable if you keep playing tracks continuously). Believe it or not, this problem happens with a lot of people (google ""ad-15 popping noise"")Buy an iPod instead!"
3,Brings your Nokia into the modern age!,"For some deranged reason I wanted to connect my Nokia 6800a to a 3.5mm headset. So I bought the AD-15 and slapped it onto my Nokia 6800a. I must say the adapter works. Maybe not as great as I hoped, but well enough to get sound out of the Nokia 6800a. Getting sound into the Nokia 6800a was a challenge, but that was much less important than getting sound out. If you are still using a Nokia handset that has a pop-port this is about your only option to attach it to modern audio equipment."
4,"Not GU Ibiza, but also great","This is a great set, but just doesn't quite take me the places GU Ibiza does. There are a few aspects that do make it an absolute classic though. Disk one...the mixing between ""soul to bare"" and ""everything's not you"" is incredible. Those two tracks are soulmates. Secondly, the way he ends disk two is brilliant. At first I was a little upset that he chopped off the hardest part of the track, but after a few listens I saw the genius in it. To take you there and just fade it out like that really plays with your emotions and has you feeling the set long after your stereo has blinked out it's lights."
5,Best mixture of House/Trance music as only Sasha could do it,"Being one of my first Global Underground CD's, I really examined this CD from the first to the last song. There is no doubt in my mind that Sasha has to be one of the best performers of electronic music. Every song and every mix, has it's own personality, thanks to Sasha. If this Global Underground disc should be compared, it would only be compared with Jhon Digwee's Global Underground, Sidney, Australia. These two CD's, give you the best songs and sounds music can buy."
5,As far as mix album...about as good as they come,"This is a really strong and diverse collection, considering that all tracks are pretty much party anthems. Fantastic mixing and a nice sense of timing make Sasha one of the best club DJ around. Just pop in the album and roll...and oh, yeah...shake it, because you will be slave to the rhythm."
5,sasha is the mixer of the millenium...,"if you want to be completely lost in the music, this is it. trancey progressive house with total balls. everything on this CD is really fresh (as sasha usually gets his records well in advance of their releases). if you think you like fat boy slim or crystal method, bite into a mitsubishi and listen to sasha work his magic, you'll change your mind about what real house music is : )"
5,Why you should buy this CD,"I've only recently been immersing myself in the world and culture of dance; fortunately, a few knowledgeable friends told me about Sasha. He is truly one of the pioneers of today's dance culture, having been around since the 80s in Ibiza, Spain. He helped start all of this!He is NOT stale-- he still spins at Twilo in NYC every month, still packs the dance floor, and has been doing this for over ten years all over the world.This album manages to recreate vital elements of that dance floor mentality...There are so many wonderful elements to this album, you just have to listen to it to appreciate it. That's why you should buy it now; this is to dance what ""Kind of Blue"" by Miles Davis is to jazz. Trust me."
5,Absolute favorite Trance Effort,"Sasha's San Francisco is by far my favorite in the Global Underground series and would rank as my favorite Trance CD period. Both discs have a very dark, eerie start to them with what sounds like recordings of street people singing and discussing the dark side of San Francisco. It slowly builds from this into some of the best trance mixes I've heard. It's hard to go wrong with the efforts in the GU series and you can't go wrong with this one."
3,"Decent, but not that good....","This cd was really sort of a let down. While the mixing on it is excellent, and the songs are absolutely beautiful, the whole thing is sort of bland.What I mean is, for the most part, none of the songs really stand out. While they're pleasant to listen to, none of them reach into your soul, and grab it (so to speak).It's hard to explain, but part of the appeal of trance (and techno/dance music in general), is that it has the ability to affect the listener on a spiritual/emotional level. For me, anyway, this album fails to do it. At least on Disc 1. Disc 2 does in places, but also suffers from bland songs.Still, it's a good album. Better than most stuff put out nowdays. And the first song on Disc 2 is pretty funny. (Especially if you don't like hippies)"
1,What a Waste,"I find it hard to belive that other listeners actually enjoyed this CD. Almost every song has the exact same tempo and the CD feels like it is stuck in a rut. Besides this, not one song stands out of the mix. It sounds like one, long, boring track. In my opionion a complete waste of money"
2,disappointment,this product was not as clear as I wanted. Even though it has a light it is hard to see the numbers.
2,Disappointing,"When I first got this, I thought it would be great since it had the back light. However, once the 2 AAA batteries start going, not only can you barely see the card numbers (unless you tilt it about 80 degrees away from you), but the light doesn't illuminate anything. There's just this faint glow. I much preferred the older version that used 2 AA batteries, had a backlight but also shut down not just the game but the light as well--when not in use. That was an AWESOME feature. Bring back THAT design. Sometimes it's just not good to ""improve""."
2,Radica Fliptop Not Tops,"Loved my original Radica Solitaire, but it died on me after 7-8 years of active use. This new Radica sux. Bigger and bulkier than original, which could easily be pocketed. Numbers (cards) are very dim and difficult to read - even clicking on the light (which is new) doesn't help - only illuminates the dim numbers. Why do folks tinker with success? If it ain't broke, don't fix it.Bought the Mattel Radica Solitaire and it's a little better, but not much."
3,On the go,This is the second Radica Fliptop Solitaire game that I have owned and both were gifts. The first was several years ago and became a handy time filler when waiting for a friend at Dr's appointments . I took it camping and was pleased with the Fliptop as it kept the screen protected. I thought that the first one had finally played out its last card and requested a new one for my birthday. In the meantime a little cleanup with compressed air ( the kind in a can) plus some new batteries revived the old one! Now I have two Fliptop Solitaires to keep me entertained!
4,This is a good book about techniques for doing your own deco,"This book is about the techniques involved in doing your own decorating, such as hanging your own wallpaper, doing stencilling, covering your sofas, etc. It really isn't an idea book, there aren't any room layouts, etc. But if you have an idea of what you want to do, this helps with the techniques to do it yourself. LOTS of pictures."
3,An American doing Sherlock Holmes?,"As soon as I read Heston doing Holmes,I said this one I got to buy.....the movie is not bad (it could have been worst)taking in to account that Heston has not an ounce of British accent.....just call it a different kind of Holmes (and Watson for that matter)........"
1,Dreadful,"""The Crucifer of Blood"" is a tarted-up re-write of ""The Sign of the Four,"" with Conan Doyle's original chivalrous romance replaced by some queasy, ugly modern sadism. It would be bad enough on its own, but here you also get beetle-browed Charlton Heston, as unconvincing as ever, clutching a meerschaum between those dentures as if it were some hapless liberal. Not the worst Sherlock Holmes of all time -- that honor goes to Leonard Nimoy -- but close enough."
5,good book,came quickly (quicker than expected..in time for christmas) and arrived in good condition. priced great and as son only needed it for school project the price was important. he does enjoy the book though so it will be used longer than the project needed for.
5,"For classic Urquhaart, this is the album for you.","By using the sounds and rhythms of nature, especially the sea shore, this album offers a very expressive and often dramatic portrayal of the planet we call home. Rarely does one hear music that is this poetic and beautiful."
3,"Not P.D.Q. Bach, but not bad either","Some of the reviews and the product review hint that this is a P.D.Q. Bachwork, which it is not. It is Peter Schikele performing other original andinteresting material. Think of this like the material that Peter Shickeletypically includes in the P.D.Q. Bach albums ""just for some relief""; in factit is really better than that material.I think anyone who enjoys the P.D.Q. Bach series will enjoy this CD. Justbe aware that there is no P.D.Q. Bach narrative or reference anywhere onit except in the liner notes to bring our attention to the fact that PeterShickele also created P.D.Q. Bach.So why only 3 stars? Compared to my favorite P.D.Q. Bach albums,this is just not as entertaining. Okay, but it lacks the greatness of the best."
2,Disappointing,"Well, Peter (PDQ Bach) has written his own texts for both pieces. The Prokofiev is simply out of place & time. I do'nt know what it means. The Animals are a bit better, containing a few amusing moments.As a whole, the thing seems quite irrelevant & disappointing."
3,The Mental Game of Golf,"I like the concept of this book, but I like the original version better. The great quoites were all placed in boxes for quick review. Great reading for Jr. golfers also. The newer version left out the boxes and changed the text font style and I did not think this was as great as the original."
2,Book full of things you already know,I felt there was nothing in the book that was useful information. All the book talks about is stress and anxiety and how to deal with those poroblems. Nothing you don't know already. You feel like your reading the same thing over and over. No useful info that will help your game.
5,Can't believe that was Ricki!,"Ricki Lake, Blondie, and Divine are among the cast members who make this film a true gem and a delight to watch. I love the dancing and the 60's feel. It deals with serious topics such as growing up, teen rebellion and racism, but has enough laughs to drown out any pessimism. I can sort of identify with this movie because I live in Maryland (close to Baltimore).Ricki was so cute and innocent back then. Look at her now! What a difference a trashy, talk show makes!"
4,Very Fun....A Definite Classic!!!,"Even though i love the musical version, this version is still a winner! It is a very fun and cute comedy starring Ricki Lake as the original Tracy Turnblad. Even though it doesn't have the musical numbers like the current version of the movie, I still love this movie, because I love the original plot and characters of this very memorable comedy! It is definitely a feel good movie!"
3,"Love That Name, 'Corny Collins!'","This fast-moving, corny film had mostly good things going for it.The film was very corny, but that was the idea. In fact, one of the characters is named ""Corny Collins."" What a great name! It was pretty charming film, too, with the put-ons about the old American Bandstand-type dance shows that were television for years. ""Hairspray"" features some good 1960s music, too, and some of the dances in here are hilarious.The first half of this movie is about local teens of that period and the dance and petty jealousies in the group while the second half theme is all about racism. It's almost like two movies-in-one.The film takes place in Baltimore, and whether racism in that city was a bad as filmmaker John Waters portrays it here, I don't know, but I wouldn't be happy if I lived in that city and saw this movie. They don't come off looking too good!"
3,Good,"The movie was good. Unfortunately, I watched it after watching the musical remake and that impacted my opinion. The story line was good. I'm not disappointed in the purchase."
5,"Far superior to ""American Grafitti""","Why do I say that? Because, while ""Grafitti"" gave us an affectionate look at youth and the approaching loss of innocence, ""Spray"" does the same with so much more insight into social hypocracy. It also tauts the perseverence and courage of social outcasts to see beyond all the baloney and still shine. Great, thoughtful satire which never loses itself by taking itself too seriously. This one holds up."
3,A True Picture of Baltimore,"I grew up in Baltimore in the 60's and had appeared on occasion on the real dance show this movie was based on (The Buddy Dean Show). Also the real Buddy Dean makes a cameo appearence in the movie as a tv reporter at the goveror's mansion. You can still walk the streets of East Baltimore and see women like Divine still shopping in their scuffies, their hair in curlers, and cat's eye sunglasses. These are known as Baltimore ""Hons"". This movie and indeed all John Water's movies are a true depiction of Baltimore life past and present. Everything you see in the movies can still be seen on the streets of ""Bawlmer"". I must admit I am surprised that there is such a following as us ""Baltimorons"" thought no one else would understand the truly local humor and culture. I highly recommend all his movies and I know you will enjoy them. Hope this bit of local trivia helps you understand the movie a little better. Enjoy!!"
5,HAIRSPRAY IS THE BOMB YO!,"John Waters is a brilliant director, in Hairspray we see the final apperance of a much beloved Cult Icon. Divine was just about to hit mainstream, just when Hairspray hit the Top 5 Box Office. Divine passed away, none the less, Divine gave one last wonderful gem in Hairspray.Deboarh Harry, yet another ""POP CULTURE ICON"" gives a great performance, as does Pia Zadora, Ric Ocasek and Mink Stole. The movie is set in Baltimore, where TV Dance Shows and Theme Parks are segregated along Racial lines. Hairspray is light hearted and just jam packed with great music. This is also Ricki Lake'sdebute, and she is just fantastic as ""Tracey the Hair Hopper""Buy, Buy, Buy........This movie is great for all ages, it's the other ""Grease"" that never caught on fire."
4,Ahhhh...memories,"I really liked this movie. My mother bought it a while back when we heard of the new Hairspray movie. And, although this one was very funny, it lacked the ooomph that the new one had. I liked Ricky Lake as Tracy Turnblad. I also thought the person who playued Penny was better in this one.If you like musicals, go and see the new one with Nikki Blonsky and Zac Efron."
5,I LOVE THIS MOVIE,I LOVE THE FIRST HAIRSPRAY MOVIE. IF THIS IS THE FIRST ONE I LOVE IT. IT SHOWED THE TRUTH IN THE 40S/ 50S.
3,Hairspray the movie,"Watching the new version just wanted me to see the original again. I enjoyed Divine's performance and Ricki Lake is a sweet heart. The only problem is, I just kept expecting them to burst out in song. hehehhee Still loved it. Thank you John Waters."
3,Hairspray (1988),this movie is good and Ricki Lake did a great job in it but the newer version is better in alot of ways.
5,ROACHES? My Tracy's a CLEAN TEEN.....,"This is campy, vampy, feel-good fun which will pick you up no matter how down you are. Ricki Lake stars, and, unlike the talk show she would later go on to host, ""Hairspray"" is tacky in an affectionate, not mean-spirited way. Divine has never been better, and watch out for Debbie Harry's exploding hair. Among John Water's more mainstream efforts, ""Hairspray"" is the best, with maybe ""Polyester"" coming in a close second."
4,Ricky Lakes Dancin,Ricky lake plays a cool white Chic Tracey Turnblad..who's dream is to be on the local after school dance show...She's a little chubby so some of the kids don't like her but she's the best white dancer in town...She gets lots of publicity a fights against segregation..It's quite humerous..They really dog her with the fat comments in this film..But she dances her tail off..
3,Please enter a title for your review,"There are some unique funny moments, but there's so much empty space that I think I would have liked the movie better if it was edited down to half it's length. Discovering John Waters' films in reverse chronological order this is basically the exact same movie as Crybaby. Paranoid conservative parents and teen rebellion in the 50s/60s era with a dramatic focus that seems to overshadow the comedy."
1,Hairspray,"My review should not count because I expected something different for this title and found myself entirely disappointed, so I couldn't frame a fair minded opinion.This item purchased from Amazon.Hairspray (1988)"
5,Deborah Harry is the greatest!,"I can remember seeing this movie when it was released in theaters, and I just watched it again on video. Deborah Harry is the greatest! I almost fell off my butt when she said, ""Is your daughter mulatto?"""
5,This is John Waters's best,I loved this movie since I was a girl.This film came out when I was 9 years old and let me tell you...I wanted to be Tracy Turnblad and have Divine as my mother!!! It is so cool. I just wish Tracy would have kicked that little snot Amber's butt!!! Cool performance by Deborah Harry!!!! Now its time for you know what......
3,Just okay,"If you like musicals, you may enjoy this one. I thought it was just okay, but I don't like most musicals. Divine was great as usual."
2,campy,"I'm not a big fan of John Waters or the genre, so I wasn't expecting much. I realize that everything about this was very tongue and cheek. Fans of Divine may enjoy it, but I felt the jokes were stale."
1,Lousy movie,I saw the stage production and thought that since it was good the movie would be good also. I was very wrong. The movie is awful
5,An amazing account,"I thought this might be a tabliod type expose, but to my delight, it really is a thorough, factual work. Each and every president is covered and the historic research is evident. Many sections are dry and boring only because those presidents weren't particularly sex driven men. But the notable exceptions like Lyndon ""Bull Nuts"" Johnson, Jack Kennedy and others make this an eye opening and shocking account of what our presidents really are doing behind closed doors. After reading this book, you want to give this country back to King George! 5 stars to Nigel for his tireless research and fact finding."
3,Book,The book came when it said it would. I wish it wasn't so dirty looking but none the less I was glad I got it
3,Quaint but hard to read,"This is cute, and i realize its a historic piece and old, but its very hard to read. the 's' appears as 'f', and you have to sit there and figure it if its actually an s or an f and it takes forever.informative but i wouldn't buy anything like this agian..."
1,Unreadable.,"I don't know if that's how they published things back in 1796, or what, but nearly every 'S' in the book appears as an 'F' . Which makes reading the book quite a challenge. For instance, here is the first paragraph, as it appears in the book:""As this treatife is calculated for the improvement of the rifing generation of Females in America, the Lady of fafhion and fortune will not be difpleafed, if many hints are fuggefted for the more general and univerfal knowledge of thofe females in this country, who by the lofs of their parents, or other unfortunate circumftances, are reduced to the neceffity of going into families in the line of domeftics, or taking refuge with their friends or relations, and doing thofe things with are really effential to the perfecting them as good wives, and ufeful members of fociety.""And the ENTIRE book is like that. I'm returning it to Amazon right now. Unless this is a secret code, which you can decipher, I wouldn't purchase this product."
4,A gift for my son,"My son loves to cook and he likes history, so I got him this as a present. Also gave a copy to my neices husband - a chef. Both were happy with it."
4,Buena producción.,Este disco del solista de flauta Alexander Zonjic es una muestra de un trabajo muy bien producido por otro genio de la música como es Bob James.Las improvisaciones de flauta quizas podrian haber sido más interesantes. Bellísimas las interpretaciones clásicas como la Siciliana de Faure.
5,"I loved it, Kids hated it......","Because it gives you concise, constructive, age appropriate manners. We could set appropriate standards/expectations and we could follow through and enforce them. Mealtime has become much more enjoyable."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this for my young daughter thinking it was mostly instrumental. It is sung by a choir. I just don't like it. The songs, I believe, don't sound good in a choir format. I kinda feel like I'm at a high school performance. Go to another website to listen to more songs. I should have and I should have read the reviews. This was a pricey mistake."
5,The Real Christopher Columbus,This book offers a great first hand look at Christopher Columbus and his true motives. One of my favorite books. Refreshing read since some are trying to re-write history by describing him negatively.
5,"Cheerful, late romantic sound, with lots of sparkle!","The Dutch composer Wagenaar is unfortunately not well known, but if this recording is any indication, he should be much better known. I heard the last piece on this CD on a local radio broadcast, & purchased the CD for that reason. Most of the time when I've done this, the other works on most CD's I find not usually as appealing as the work that caused me to purchase the CD. But this one turned out to an exception to this ""rule."" I found all the works presented here to be joys to listen to. Wagenaar had a gift for rich colorful orchestration, along with wonderful orchestral color and catchy tunes and embellishments. Highly recommended!"
2,Poor Sound Quality,"Earphones are very uncomfortable, even though I tried with all 3 earpads (S-M-L). Sound quality is awful... they can't handle any type of bass. I wouldn't recommend this product."
1,Don't bother!,"My 8 year old daughter bought this game with her own money. She was very diappointed with it. It only has 1 game and the difficulty level can not be adjusted. This game should be labeled for 4 to 6 year olds as it does not hold the interest of anyone above that age group. Fortunately, we found a 100 per cent guarantee of satisfaction on the package and instructions on how to mail it back within 30 days if you are not satisfied. We were happy to mail it back! Don't waste your money on this game!!"
4,Disney DVD Game World - Disney Princess Edition,"Fun for the whole family! My 4 year-old can play along with her big sister and answer the questions too! The game can seem a little slow, but it has been fun!!!"
3,Fun for a while!,"The first few times that you play this game is really fun but after that questions start to get repeated. I really enjoyed seeing all of the dogs that Disney has had in their movies throuout the years. One thing that I have noticed is that the game tends to give many turns to one person while the next person gets just one. It doesn't seem to be random. Difficulty wise, I would say that small children could have some trouble with it and even adults could be challenged by some of the questions. All in all, I like the game. I just wish the game was a little more fair on turns and that the questions did not repeat so much. I don't think that it is worth more than $10 or $15. Disney has many films starring cats. Maybe they should make that game next."
3,Great When Working,"Very fun game, my son likes it a lot. Most of the time though, it does not go back and forth for turns. It gives one player (or the other) many turns at a time."
4,This one kicks butt !,"Love this soundtrack, especially since the songs are all performed by the actors in the film! not just another ""chick flick"" The movie is awesome"
5,"loved the movie, loved the cd",truly one of the best soundtracks out there. bandits have put a lot of passion and inspiration into every song and succeeded. Way cool!
5,a great movie with a wonderful soundtrack,i saw the movie a couple years ago when i was in germany and i bought the soundtrack a week later. i just wanted to comment that it was the best music purchase that i ever made. enjoy listening ( :-( even though there is no way to buy the movie from amazon.com)
3,Why so expensive,Why is this doll so expensive? Are there different versions or something? $75 seems awfully high for a doll!
4,upbeat and emotional,"The Gloria Records' second EP seems a lot more upbeat after the first listen. But after a few more, it becomes clear that the EMO style is still there. The production is spot on, and the songs are about as well written as a song can get. I only wish they didn't sound so much like Canadian alterna-rockers ""Our Lady Peace"". oh well... i'll take the pepsi challenge with these two anyday. A lull in Traffic is a must buy."
4,"Not really Belle and Sebastian, but just as good.","It's a shame that Belle and Sebastian are given credit as the main contributors to this album because that truly misrepresents the sound. The real brain child behind this project is Gary Lightbody of Snowpatrol. Fans of Snowpatrol can look forward to an album of sparkeling beauty. Where it will fall short is the lack of catchy pop hooks and lyrics that stay with you all day like those on SP's first two albums. The first half of the songs on the album start out at a slow pace while some percussion appears in the back half to create a little more toe tapping and head bobbing, all the while layered with GL's soothingly smooth vocals.Any fan of Snowpatrol will appreciate this album, as well as Belle and Sebastian fans if they are not expecting Stuarts witty sarcasm to appear anywhere. Oh, by the way members of Mogwai, Astrid, V-twin, Mull Historical Society, Eva, Arab Strap and Hercules appear as well (good luck finding most of these bands)."
4,Nice album,"Nice smooth album. If you are a fan of Gary Lightbody you will really like the music. It's more mellow than the past few Snow Patrol albums, but a nice relaxing listen. I would recommend this cd."
5,Wonderful Book,"Rober Inman's detailed descriptions bring to life an old Southern town and one of its matriarchs, Bright Birdsong in a story of wisdom, understanding and forgiveness."
1,As cliched as the title,Couldn't finish this cliched re-telling of the good white people helping the poor black people get their justice. There were some interesting characters and features but overall it was just too one-dimensional.
4,Great DVD,I have bought coaching products before but they have always cost me a fortune and I had to buy a whole set of DVDs.Glad to finally have everything on one disk. I especially like the tactics section as it was nice to see everything put into practice !Highly recommend modern tennis essential tools.
2,No Instructions??!!!,"The set is pretty, but I had no idea how to mount them since there were no instructions. Even the handyman that I paid to install each piece could not get the towel rack to seat firmly into the mounting bracket. So now it wobbles. Not happy :( If not for that problem I would rate the set higher because the pieces look nice and seem to be well made in terms on the metal that is used. But they really should include instructions and better mounting brackets."
3,"Good looking, But robe hook not up to par.","Did some research on line, looking for a brushed nickel look for the hardware in our bath. I like all of it except the double hook mount that comes with this set. It is way to small to hang 2 towels or 2 robes even. Other than that it's very nice. So if you really don't need the hook's or this is for just one person. Then I would recommend it. I have had this for a couple of yrs now. and it has not gotten a rusted or stained look, that some metal gets in humidity. Which is a good thing."
5,very well done,"If I said that this record was one of the best trance compilations that I've heard, that would probably be meaningless to you, since an opinion is at best, subjective. So let me give you a list of records that I consider to be top quality, and if you agree with me on this list, you'll probably agree with me on Budapest :) Danny Howells - Nocturnal Frequencies ii & Nu Breed Steve Lawler - Nu Breed /Dark Drums Digweed - GU 6 and 19 Dave Seaman - everything except for Renaissance America (get his Renaissance 4 mix with Ian Ossia if you can - a great record that) Lucien Foort - Singularity ii. These records aren't similar to Budapest at all, but if you've got the above records and enjoy them, then you'll probably enjoy the superior track selection and mixing on this one. Warren seems to attract a lot of flak, but I started listening to him just a few weeks ago (when I got a copy of Amsterdam), and I've temporarily put my Danny Howells CDs back on the shelf..."
4,This came AFTER Brazil? Weird.,"Very good trance CD. What makes it stand out is the consistency of the quality of the tracks, which is amazing. The drawback being there is no one track that stands out, but on the other hand they're all pretty good.One thing I must say though -- Never, ever, EVER sample porn soundtracks. ""I Want You"" on the second disk is by FAR the worst trance track ever. EVER."
5,clarity from chaos,"The organization of this book makes corporate and partnership tax law more approachable than I ever thought possible! Kwall's use of Examples throughout the book takes concepts and makes them concrete. Clarity is further gained through Problems he provides which often mimic the Examples so that you can try them on your own. The division of the book into sections on Contributions, Distributions, and Operations also allows a good side-by-side comparison of the various tax consequences of different business entities. Excellent. Highly recommend it for anyone struggling to grasp such dense material."
1,Not as described! 31 pages only,"While the big books is probably excellent, this $5 ""book"" is a suppliment that is entirely on the order of ""In note 4, delete the sixth line and insert; ""property, E&P is reduced by the value of the property (to the extent the distribution is treated as a dvidend)."" "" Perhaps useful if you have the 2006 edition and need the 2007 corrections, but totally useless without the original book. Not what I was expecting."
2,I kept it bc I needed it,"She replied to all my messages and was concern about the shipping issue. Unfortunately, the description of the item was off. The book was described as ""Like New"" but it was highlighted everywhere, with notes in the margins, and there were coffeee stains in four of the pages."
5,industrial magic,excellent follow up to dimestore i look forward to reading more about the women of the otherworld
3,Just average,"I regulary read all sorts of fantasy and love a good vampire story. Unfortunately, when I read Kelley Armstrong's books I feel as if I'm just passing time until a good book is published. I have read several of her books because some of the characters and ideas intrigued me, but each story has left me wanting."
3,Industrial Magic -moving up in the world,"Kelly Armstrong once again returns to her world of witches, werewolves, wizards(OK, sorcerers), and various other fantastic creatures. In this installment we once again follow the adventures of Paige Winterbourne as she struggles to understand her magic, deal with an adolescent witch, and cope with a sorcerous lover. Add to the mix someone who is killing Cabal children, and a father who is determined to bring Lucas back into the ""friendly"" family Cabal, and you have an adventure that will keep you wondering ""what next?""."
3,Industrial Magic,"Not a very good book. I was expecting Elene the werewolf to be the main character in every book and was very dissapointed when started reading ""Dime Store Magic"" and ""Industrial Magic""."
5,Industrial Magic,"Awsome, suspense and fantasy. Keeps you hooked from beginning to end. I love the way each books ties into the books before them draws you into the family of characters. I highly recommend this series of books and the author Kelly Armstrong."
4,Industrial Magic,4th in the series of Women of The World. I was not disappointed. I am looking forward to the next one in the series. I will not buy the short story which is later in the series. This plot moves along well and has some interesting turns.
5,well balanced and intriguing read,"Paige wasn't one of my favorite characters in previous Armstrong novels but I found her development in Magic to be well thought out and provoking. I love the interaction between her and Savannah and Cortez. The story filters in enough romance, mystery, magic and mayhem to keep a reader on the edge of the seat."
5,fantastic,"I really, really enjoyed this book. I had read Bitten and Stolen, and found them boring and long-winded with few interesting characters and litle substance. So I skipped Dime Store Magic. Then I gave in and read Industrial Magic, and boy am I glad I did. The writing is finally sharp, riveting, and there's lots of action and mystery. Paige the witch and Lucas the sorceror are very well-grounded (not-annoying) people who jet set all over the United States trying to solve complex mysteries involving the Cabal, the super-rich sorceror mafia families. I was half-way through and overjoyed that there was so much more to go. The characters are very well flushed out (compared to her first two books), and the plot is very good, with lots of little turns and the benevolent godfather/Mr. Cortez Cabal figure in it. Totally recommended."
3,Good but with mistakes,"This book had excellent descriptions of the trails, and despite trail markings that were sometimes difficult to follow, the book guided us through comfortably. That being said, the book has at least one blatant error in it. The book says you do not need to register to camp in the back country, but we learned that this is false. Back country registration is required, and there is a $5 fee for each party of 6 or less."
3,100 Trails of the Big South Fork: Tennessee and Kentucky,I purchased this for a friend that had planned hiking in thestate of Kentucky. This was a great big help in his travels.
5,A perfect fit!!,My 2000 Pontiac Grand Prix GTP was due for a tune up. I always buy the Bosch wires for my vehicles. They are always a perfect fit and perform very well.
4,spark plugs,"There were many different choices of spark plugs for my car: many brand names and many different grades(regular, premium, etc...) I picked these because they were listed as ""premium"" and the price was not too bad. I'm not sure if they are any better than cheaper wires. I replaced 5 out of 6 on my 2005 Chevrolet Impala 3.8L(non-supercharged) because I could not get one off no matter what I tried. It's in a tight spot and I figured I would just leave it for now; 5 out of 6 is better than none..."
2,Not Worth It,"This is actually several of the Flischer shorts edited together to make one movie. Because of this, there is no real plot. The episodes included are: The prologue from The Mad Scientist, Volcano, Billion Dollar Limited, The Bulleteers, Destruction, Inc., Terror on the Midway, The Mummy Strikes, The Mechanical Monsters, The Underground World, & The Magnetic Telescope. In a couple places the transitions are a little clumsy in an attempt to make one cohesive film. The few classic commercials included are not worth the extra price. Also, the interactive menu did not work. All I could select was ""Play All."" I would save my money & buy all 17 movies in a boxed set for a cheaper price right here on Amazon. Or, if you want, Wikipedia says they are all public domain and you can download them for free."
1,rip off,"This product is a total rip off, there is no lost 1942 film. What you get instead is the Superman cartoons shorts. These I already have. Don't waste your money, you can get these cartoons elsewhere and in superior quality. The opening and endings are cut out, so one short merges into the other."
3,Gift for a friend,"Older cartoon, found this by accident while researching something totally different. Tesla came up an another search and as we dug deeper we realized that our friend who likes Superman would possibly like this."
3,Great epic told via the challenging brain-dump narration technique,"FYI, here is the review I posted on Amazon.com review for the Kindle edition of this same unabridged work:http://www.amazon.com/Dream-Mansion-Complete-Unexpurgated-ebook/product-reviews/B004XO01SA/ref=cm_cr_dp_see_all_btm?ie=UTF8&showViewpoints;=1&sortBy;=bySubmissionDateDescendingIt's by the same translator."
2,Skip this translation....,"...and read ""Story of the Stone"". And this is about upper-class life, not ""Exposing social evils, the book cries out denunciation against the feudal system."""
2,Translation,Not a good translation and hard to follow. I wish the translation was better into what is a classic book with many meanings.
5,Underground in its Finest,"Murs prooved that he and his Living Legends Crew are one of the best, if not the only one Underground Crew, who managed not to fall under the influence of the big ""money"" game.This CD features some Guest Appearances, and the beats are made either by Eligh or by Murs himslef.The beats are sharp and go beyond the normal beats. For a Living Legends fan, this CD is a must in their Collection."
5,fantastic!,"I LOVE, love, love this album! I am a huge Soul Coughing enthusiast and this is a great addition to the collection. Mike Doughty's voice over acoustic tunes...it's bliss. i haven't been able to stop listening to this album since i bought it.and for the Review that Daniel S. Carrus wrote... ""it's not soul coughing"" -- no duh... it doesn't claim to be, it's Mike Doughty - Skittish Rockity Roll... and it's wonderful!you will not be disappointed."
4,Good album even for the live songs...,I LOVE Soul Coughing. This is NOT Soul Coughing. I understood that due to the fact that I also two other Mike Doughty albums. One better than the other. This double CD is pretty good for him. I'm not a real fan of live albums but the sound quality and songs make this one a worthwhile cd for my collection.
4,A Wonderful Performance for Half the Price,"While the D'Oyle Carte Production of ""Pirates"" (on London Records) may be the best of the bunch, the performers on this particular CD still have much to be proud of. There may not be any standout performances (like that of Owen Brannigan on the album mentioned above) but all of the singers here do a fine job. This is a fun, energetic production of one of G&S's finest operas and, best of all, it fits all the music, save the overture, onto a single CD. Recommended for both the curious and completists alike."
2,Surprised to be disappointed,"I like everything Charles Mackerras conducted -- his performances are clear, spirited and distinctive. Yet, I don't enjoy this recording. In my opinion it is hurried and characterless. Spirited on the surface, but lacking the natural good-natured quality of older, classic recordings."
2,"A good idea, but that's where it stops",This holster even after adjusting the tension screw is too tight for my glock 17. It takes two men and a boy to pull this gun out of the holster. Not overly impressed
1,Junk,"This product is absolute junk. The CD player sounded a little funny right from the start. That should have been the clue to return it immediately. Shortly after the return period expired, the CD player stopped working. The tape player started eating tapes shortly after that. Avoid this product. It is cheap in the worst sense of the word."
3,Beatles Hit the Road With Aunt Jessica And Friends,"I like the eleven Beatles music scenes that are essentially pre-MTV music videos. Unfortunately, the remainder of the program, which mainly features ""Aunt Jessica"", will give you nightmares. They should have provided an option to play only the Beatles music scenes."
1,interresting but the act was confusing!,I rather decide to see Deep purple concert rather to see the Beatles had acted like a fool in this film. No stories at all and has no sense! the songs are okay but if you re the Beatles die hard fans only!
4,"C'mon, it's the Beatles","Despite the usual panning of this movie, I found it to be hilarious and made for people who just want to relax their minds and float upstream. Not technically great but c'mon, it's the Beatles."
2,"Painful, in an entertaining way","Speaking as a true Beatle fan who, in my younger days, had a tough time acknowledging that everything the Beatles ever did wasn't perfect, I have to say this is one of the most painful things I've ever seen. But to its credit, you can't NOT watch it once it's on. You're just taken aback by how disjointed and bizarre it is.Seen as separate music videos, the songs all hold up. They're also slightly remixed from the way they eventually appeared on the corresponding album, so that's kinda neat.But did you ever think that the best performance of a song in a Beatles film would be performed by the Bonzo Dog Band? (Interesting that Bonzo Neil Innes would later play Ron Nasty in the Rutles, isn't it?)If you must have this, have somebody buy it for you..."
4,MMT is dying to take you away... but only if you let it!,"We can judge this film from a critical cynical point of view, and it'll be awful because it was a rush job. That's not the point. Watch the film with an open heart, enjoy the sillyness, enjoy the music, let the magic work on you. We all need a bit of colour in our lives, and this film provides a breath of fresh air, frees us from our normal hectic daily lives, and takes us into a different world where we can be children again, jumping and frolicking without a care in the world. In this context, the food dream and the strip show scene are out of place, which is why I give only 4 stars, but I nevertheless felt heartened and enlightened by the film. I'm glad I bought it."
3,Time piece,"A great film? Well, no, but it has entertaining bits and fabulous music. This is most important for Beatles fans interested in their history, and wanting to catch a glimpse of them during this vital trippy period."
2,IM A BIG BEATLES FAN BUT.........,".......The movie sucks. It really has no point whatsoever, and I really think they were on drugs and experimenting wirth cocaine when they made this film. If you really watch this movie it has no point, and is nothing but a bunch of crappy stuff thrown together. But not that I dont love the Beatles. They are the best. The album ""Magical Mystery Tour"" has some of their best music. But this movie isn't the best at all. ""A Hard Day's Night"" and ""Help"" have some sort of story to them, and are excellent."
2,dead crap!!!,"i am a mega-beatlefan, but this dvd is of such poor quality,i couldn't even enjoy it. the color is off and so is the sound. at times it would freeze the frame. there are some hysterical and unforgettable scenes in mmt nonetheless.i would not reccommend it to anyone. i am very disappointed that anyone would release such a great piece of musical history on such a grotty dvd.save your money and watch the precious clips of mmt on the anthology dvdwhich is fab."
4,I think it's cool,"Magical Mystery tour is a cool little film with some funny scenes and some good music. So what if it's ""weird"" or offbeat. It's the Beatles! They were always creative and fun to watch, and they ventured out and tried new things. I had never seen this until I got it recently, and I like it."
1,Magical Mystery Tour falls flat,"This movie has really gained nothing from it DVD release. The picture quality is dreadful, with so much dust from the film, that obviously no clean-up has even been attempted. The color is barely there, and certainly not with the spirit of the movie being vivid and bright. This is all due to a poor film print used for the DVD transfer, and no digital editing to restore color or remove glitches. The quality of this disc is no better than that of the video-tape version, which I also own. No Special features, and the previously mentioned problems amount to an overall disappointing DVD."
1,Poor Video Quality,The DVD I ordered Beatles Magical Mystery Tour had very poor blurry video quality. It looked like a video where too many copies of it had been made.It was so bad it looked out of focus.
3,Beatles tv movie,"Ok it's a art film Sir Paul says. It's still hard to watch all the way throyugh, some minor editing and a few scenes removed would help, also throw in the video Hello/Goodbye into the film would be a nice addition. The songs have been remastered into full stereo and sounds great in the film. Film quality lacks much, but until Apple redoes this, its as good as it gets."
1,Very disappointing !,"This DVD is a poorly made copy of either the original DVD or, more likely, a bad copy of the VHS tape. The audio track is fine, but the video is very ""blown out"" as if the sun and all artificial light was cranked up 50%. The effect is a severe loss of color and detail. There is no reason, even for the hardest core Beatles fan to own this."
3,Beatles Home Movies,"I waited many years to find a copy of this film. Looking back it may not have really been worth the wait and expense. The film, made for British televisionand shown in black and white on Boxing Day 1967 was a critical failure. Today its a colorful journey into a past thet no longer exists.The film features the bad on a ""magical mystery tour"" a bus ride with no particular destination where strange things happen. There is no more plot than that really and the film is simply an excuse for presenting some really great songs in the days before MTV.The film features videoes for The Fool on the Hill, Flying, I Am the Walrus, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know, Magical Mystery Tour and the impossible to find Death Cab For Cutie. Intermixed are scenes of wizards, a strip show and the stranges tent you've ever witnessed.This one is for die hard fans only but it is an enjoyable way to spend an hour. The standard definition DVD features the film and zero extras."
3,"good movie,bad quailty transfer",i'm a huge beatle fan and when i finally got a chance to watch this i was excitied.It's really hard to enjoy this movie with the poor quailty transfer....it looks like a real bad pirated copy..well hopefully someday it will be re-mastered so it can be appreciated for what is supposted to be
3,Utter confusion but fun...,"My seven year old daughter has become a Beatles fan and so daddy purchased the Beatle albums and available movies, as well as this BBC television production. (Daddy grew up during the era, in both the UK and the USA and is a Beatles fan himself.)An obvious fly by the seat of your pants production, with lines made up as the film was underway and some obvious tenstion between the band members, neither my daughter nor I understand most of what is happening except the Beatles seem to think that ""Dewsberry road"" is a comical line and my daughter likes the film.If you are a die hard Beatles fan, you might want to have it simply to have it. If you are not, stick with the album of the same name.The picture quality is poor, at best. The story line is as close to non-existent as it could be and still seemingly have a story line."
3,MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR---IT TOOK ME AWAY---HARDLY,"Magical Mystery Tour is like nothing else i have ever seen. It is very intresting and creative, but only hard-core Beatles fans would like it. This is only for completists also. There is no plot to it. The best parts of it were the musical sequences. My favorite was I AM THE WALRUS sequence. The only reason this got a 3 was because of the music. I do not recommend this one highly, but the songtrack is a killer!!"
2,not the best,dont get me wrong I love the beatles but the movie was aliitle bit strange for my taste. plus the songs weret very good. the only songs I like were i am the walrus and the tile tune.the movie is best view a a cursoity.if you want a intro the the beatles movies rent yellow submarine or hard days night.
4,reallllllyyyy coooool,This video is one of the best movies of the beatles collection but does not tell all the story
3,THIS VIDEO IS A MUST FOR A TRUE FAN,"THIS VIDEO IS VERY FUNNY. IT STARTED OUT AS A TOUR OF THE BRITISH COUNTRY-SIDE. THE BEATLES WERE GOING TO GATHER A GROUP OF PEOPLE TOGHETHER ON A BUS, AND FILM WHAT HAPPENED. NOTHING HAPPENED, SO THEY FILMED SOME MORE. THEY FILMED SOME MUSIC 'VIDEOS' FOR 'THE FOOL ON THE HILL' IN FRANCE, AND OTHER SONGS FROM THE ALBUM. PLUS, YOU GET TO GUESS WHO THE WALRUS WAS. ONE OF MY FAVORITE PARTS WAS WHEN JOHN HAD HIS HAIR SLICKED BACK, AND WAS A WAITER. HE KEPT FEEDING THIS FAT LADY(RINGOS' AUNT) SPAGEHETTI WITH A SHOVEL, AND HAD A EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE LIKE HE WAS MAD(CRAZY), AND CRACKING UP. PAUL MCCARTNEY WAS THE DIRECTOR OF THE MOVIE, BECAUSE HE WAS THE ONE THAT WAS THERE MOST OF THE TIME. THIS MOVIE IS UP THERE WITH HELP, A LAUGH A MINUTE. I LOVED IT."
1,Not at all satisfied!!!,"I was very dissatisfied with this purchase!!! We did not receive the item that was advertised (different release date that is known for bad quality). When I inquired about returning the item, they were very prompt in getting back to me. However, they would not send me the item that I ordered as an exchange because now the item is $30 more than when we put the order in. I told them that was not our fault - had they sent the one we ordered at the correct time, there wouldn't have been an issue. Makes me wonder if it was known that the price was going to rise??? They did work with me towards the steps for a refund but I will be sure not to order from them in the future. Again.....IT IS NOT OUR FAULT THAT THE PRICE CHANGED. I didn't feel that they understood that. Not very good customer service if you ask me!"
5,the beatles magical mystery tour,"Any Beatle related movie is a treat! From the inadvertant innovators of music videos, which stirred the minds of the creators of MTV, this ""movie"" was great to watch, but the picture quality could have been greatly improved if it had the quality of the vhs release by Apple Records instead of what looks to be from the first vhs release from Media (which was the Beatles error by people wearing all white outfits), but all 'n all it was truly a long awaited release and as ""Sir Paul"" once said of the movie ""it's the only place you'll see John Lennon performing ""I am the Walrus""! Bravo!!!!"
1,With Regret....I Must Say.....This Is Horrible!!!,"The Beatles are my favorite band of all time, but there is simply no excuse for this travesty. The spaghetti scene is awful and painful to watch, the bus ride singalong is horrid and quite simply the Fab Four look [bad] in every sense of the word. This movie is so bad, it almost ruins the music. Almost. This is one blot on an otherwise flawless legend. Avoid this at all costs."
2,The fool at the remaster controls,"The Beatles Magical Mystery Tour was a mess anyway, but this DVD does nothing to help its reputation. This version claims to be ""Digitally Remastered""...by `digitally' they must mean that someone ran a finger over the film before they copied it because the quality is very very poor. But with all the flaws this DVD has, a decent version (as of 2011) has yet to be made available and so if you want to see ""Fool on the hill"", ""I am the walrus"" and ""Your mother should know"" in their full context, this is the only option available. I have it, but I wish I had waited for some better copy to come along (even if it never does)."
1,A very bad quality of image,"The quality of image is very bad, and it has not spanish subtitlesThe Beatles - Magical Mystery Tour"
2,"bad quality, very disappointing","It would have been nice if I had known how horrible the quality of the DVD was. It looked like it was transferred from a bad video cassette to a DVD. The color is terrible, and the movie is grainy throughout. I had the original video years ago, and it was fantastic quality. I am beyond disappointed!!!"
1,What The Hell Is This???,"I must say I loved The Beatles in ""Help!"" & ""A Hard Day's Night"", & I just got this movie from the library today. It's terrible...there's no plot. The music was alright; it seems like every movie they made Ringo seems to be the center of attention, (nothing wrong with that). George only has a couple of lines in the movie (I should say words), which is weird. There were a few slightly funny scenes in the movie. Like when John was with the little kid on the bus, & when the man was singing on stage with the stripper. The spaghetti scene was nasty. I wouldn't want to buy this movie; only if it's very cheap, just to have it for my up coming Beatles collection. If anyone really wants to see this moive; I'd get it at the library first. I'm sticking with ""A Hard Day's Night"" & ""Help!"""
2,The Fab Four's Glorified Home Movie,"The most devoted Beatlemaniac will have difficulty sitting through this self-indulgent TV movie. ""Magical Mystery Tour"" (1967) is best remembered for its music-video incarnations of ""I Am the Walrus,"" ""Fool on the Hill"" and ""Your Mother Should Know."" Despite moments of surrealist whimsy, the Beatles' lack of cinematic prowess is painfully evident. The soundtrack album remains a superior investment."
2,"Well, if you are a true Beatle fan....","I have been a Beatles fan since 1964, and I have distinct memories of the band's influence on my young life. I saw Hard Day's Night, Help!, Yellow Submarine, and Let It Be in the theater when they were first released. This film has always been the Holy Grail of Beatle fandom.Now that I own it, I can honestly say I understand why it took so long to release it to the public. That thirty years of isolation, locked up in a vault somewhere in London, only improved its standing in my imagination, not on actual film. The BBC was right to bury this. As a film, or television special, it's horrible.But as a fan, I had to have it. Now, that's all I can say about it; I own it. When will Let It Be be released?"
1,Beware this pirated DVD,"If you have an old VHS or DVD from the movie of the Beatles ""Magical Mystery Tour"", keep it with you. Certainly it must be better than this one for sale on Amazon Web site.I say that because I have an ancient version from the middle of the 90's that I supposed it needed an upgrade. So I decided to buy this ""remastered-release"". It's simply awful, the picture is dirty and fuzzy. In addition, there's no subtitle nor special bonus on the menu. I really don't understand how Amazon can sell a product so bad like that and the Apple Corporation allows exposing the image of The Beatles with no control over the quality.So, if you haven't bought yet the Magical Mystery Tour DVD, don't do it now. Wait at least until there's an official release like Help and A Hard day's night DVDs. Avoid this pirated copy. By the way, is it permitted in the USA?"
3,In Need of Refurbishing,"The ""digitally remastered"" (audio, I presume) DVD is sorely in need of visual and colorization upgrade also after 30+ years; what little artistic merit the film has to offer the die-hard Beatles fan or the merely curious is now fading into time and obscurity."
3,"In fact, I like it.","We all know that this movie was the only bad thing the beatles did. But, why bad? This was supposed to be a hippie or a very weird movie. It was on purpose. The music is like all the beatles music, very good. I am the warlus is like pop art and your mother should know, well, when in life you will see the greatest band of the moment ever dancing in a silly way? But you saw it here. 3 stars because of the superb bad quality of this dvd."
3,Fuzzy Movie,"A bit fuzzy, not put out by Apple or a major distributor, so that leads me to wonder, who manufactored it and if its not much more than a glorified bootleg."
1,I should have read the reviews first!!!,"I have bought from Amazon on many occasions and have found the quality of the items purchased to be great. what a disappointment after watching this DVD. I agree with many of the other reviewers that the video quality is terrible. Washed out, no detail and in geneal of poor quality. I didn't expect Amazon to ship a video that looks like a bootleg copy. My bad I should have read the reviews first."
2,Terrible quality makes this dvd a failure,The quality of this dvd is terrible. The movie is great having seen it in much better quality on the BBC. Not even an official release makes this a clear sign to stay away from this dvd. Wait a few more years for the offical release from Apple and when it is digitally remastered.
2,The VHS is/was great quality!,"I don't own this product, and from the reviews posted, I won't ever own it. I do, however, own the VHS version that was released in 1987. It was an official Apple release, and the quality is superb, both picture quality and sound quality. Fans please note that the songs that are in the movie have entirely different audio mixes than the mixes that appeared on the MMT album. So Magical Mystery Tour, Fool On the Hill, Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know and I Am The Walrus all have unique mixes on the soundtrack that you can't find anywhere else, and on the VHS tape these mixes sound really great in VHS Hi-Fi (gosh, remember that?) IMO, these mixes blow the ""regular"" mixes of these songs away.The tape is still easy to find and reasonably priced. Again, its quality is superb and I'm sure puts this DVD to shame."
3,fun to watch,a time capsule into the Beatles' psychodelic era. I enjoyed it even if the video is low quality (it was filmed on 8mm!).
1,What is this ??,"Let me say that I'm a Beatles' fan, owning all their offical released material and 2 bootlegs of Decca Sessions and Christmas Records.But this is simply impossible...""Hard Day's Night"" was a fun and interesting peep into the Beatles's daily life, great script and acting.""Help"" was a mediocre adventure movie, still with a nice plot and reasonable script.""Yellow Submarine"" was just a cartoon.""Let It Be"" was one of the greatest recording session film ever made.And this must be the greatest boo-boo the Beatles' ever made. Can't comprehend until today, why...they even had the nerve to release it ?? There is no plot, script is horrible and boring, the cut into the magicians' place was simply meaningless...The only thing worth watching is the ""I Am The Walrus"" song clip..."
1,Adding My Voice To The Chorus,"Have to agree with all the other comments about pirated copy. Good to have for historical value, but this is a washed out, low quality bootleg. The cover artwork is one step above old style computer pixelation and the label for the DVD is obviously semi-homemade.Unfortunately this is the only way to get this film (for the moment) as the general consensus regarding MMT is that it is a substandard product from the Beatles.Of course with the benefit of hindsight, its experimentation and sheer weirdness redeems it somewhat, I doubt we'll see any major remastering of this for some time. Buy this only if you're having a Magical Mystery Tour Ultra Fan Party and need a main attraction."
3,Great Cultural Reference -- this one poor quality,"This project was trend-setting at the time of creation. It has been mocked and mimicked over the decades. It is simple fun and farsity, and typical Beatles. Unfortunately, the copy I received was a very poor quality copy. It obviously was not created from the original film stock, but from a video stock or other. Too bad for me as it lessens the experience of the viewing."
5,a cult classic,"steven speilburg once said when he was in film school, this was a filmthat was required to watchTHIS FILM IS A CULT CLASSIC, AND UNLESS YOUR A GENUINE BABY-BOOMER OR HIPPIE FROM THE 60'S, OR LIKE ME A BEATLES FAN SINCE 1963, IT'S DIFFICULT TO APPRECIATE AND FOLLOW THIS FILM!!!!IT WAS HATED BY THE BRITISH PRESS,BUT THIS IS THE BEATLES AT THEIR PSYADELIC BEST AND OF COURSE THE MUSIC IS AWESOME, AND IT'S THE ONLY TIME YOU'LL SEE THE I AM A WALRUS VIDEO!!!!LIKE BEATLEMANIA, THIS FILM WILL ENDURE THE TEST OF TIME!!!!"
2,"""Lousy Video?"" The Film Version is Bad, Too...","Just a note to say, I've seen ""Magical Mystery Tour"" at least a dozen times on the silver screen as far back as 1972, and every showing I've seen - EVERY ONE - had a lousy print with lousy sound. I don't know who's to blame - the BBC, the Beatles themselves, or whoever they gave the job of making prints to , but I don't think there's any reason to think this DVD has been ""pirated"" - it's looked (and sounded) like this from the start."
5,Magical Mystery Tour,"When I first saw this movie I loved it. Sure, it is a stoner movie but so what? Non-drug addled people can enjoy it too. The film quality is not that great (a little fuzzy) but there some good songs and somewhat of a plot. I also suggest that you buy the CD as well. Awesome music to go along an awesome movie."
1,One of the Worst Films of All Time!,"Seriously. I have just seen this film (I have loved listening to my parents' copy of the album, ever since I was young, and still do). I really think it should be on the standard lists of the worst films of all time. As such, it deserves to be watched and studied. The music is among the Beatles best, but only gives a huge contrast to the incredibly poor film. (Alright, I did enjoy the performance of ""I am the Walrus"", and also George's performance of ""Blue Jay Way"") There aren't enough actual jokes for me to consider this a comedy. Surely the Beatles were succesful enough at this point in their careers that they could have hired a writer to turn their incoherent improvisations into a coherent script (whoever wrote the liner notes to the album seemed to do a good job of this), a better director than Paul, and a better Director of Photography than Ringo!"
2,Possible Bootlegged Copy,"I got my copy from raretshirts. I'm glad I have a copy on DVD. However, I was disappointed with the quality of the film. It's much like others have said. It is grainy, the color is washed out, and, in my opinion, it's just a transfer from a VHS copy.The description that you read about the film gives you the impression that the behind-the-scenes material and newsreels will be on the DVD. Not on this one!! Because of that, I was really disappointed. I probably would've given the DVD another star if those things were on there.In my opinion, if these are the only copies floating out there currently, then get one. But don't pay that much for it. I think I paid too much for the one I got."
1,Quite possibly the most terrible movie I have ever seen...,"This movie was flat out terrible. It was ridiculous, and many things had no point to it. Somethings I couldn't even follow. It was going so fast, too fast kind of like the running time. It jumped from one thing to another. It was pretty bad camara work too. I didn't have as much fun as I did watching A Hard Days Night. The only part I actually kind of enjoyed and amused me was when George, magician George, said ""a song"" that was the only thing that amused me because it was so random, and since my humor is different it actually got a laugh from me. I felt like pauls grandfather in A Hard Days Night. I felt like I was going from ""a train and a room, a car and a room, and a room and a room!"" Don't buy, whatever you do..."
1,not as the one shown,before you order this DVD this is not the real mpl version as shown on the photoThe Beatles - Magical Mystery Tour! I Had wanted the offical version i am upset i did not get the one shown the one i got is from one ave Larry
4,Fellini meets British Music Hall,"Magical Mystery Tour is more interesting not for what it was but for what it would become. It was a musical video album before MTV; a series of Monty Python skits before Monty Python's Flying Circus first hit the air; a performance by an Elvis impersonator before the King died and his impersonators were everywhere.One can wish that Richard Lester had directed it, or that the Beatles had actually given Federico Fellini a call to direct it since it's obviously an homage to him; or even that Terry Gilliam had been given this film as one of his first directing jobs. It's not as funny as it should be but that could just be my prejudice as an American not tuned to the sensibilities of English Music Hall burlesque skits.Nonetheless, the Beatles' music was magical and this film contains some of their best."
5,Beatles take a break from being wacky,I found Magical Mystery Tour interested and well done. It looks like a well-done home movie. Although it does drag in the middle. It has a kind Monty Python flare to it. My favorite songs were Fool on a Hill and I am the Walrus.
3,"5 stars for entertainment value, minus 2 for DVD quality","Most of you probably know the general details of the plot and the circumstances of this made-for-TV movie by the Beatles, so I'll stick to a review of the DVD itself. The b/w newsreels (Beatles opening their Apple Boutique, Beatles at Rishikesh) are interesting, some promos for the other Beatles-related films are OK, but I was not prepared for the really dismal quality of the film itself. A colorful (psychedelic, at that) film is now flat and washed out, the print itself speckled and grainy. This film cries out for restoration! An enjoyable film for Beatles fans (great proto-music videos), but if you have the VHS version, you don't need to spring for the DVD until a new edition (hopefully) gets released."
2,"historical value only, yet....","I had seen this many years ago so I knew what to expect - if you don't know, don't expect something like ""A Hard Days Night"". This is a very eccentric sales pitch for their new album at the time ""Magical Mystery Tour"". The credits list Ringo as the director of photography, and maybe it's true - but he's a better drummer and human being than either a director or photographer. Yet, there is much to appreciate in the historical content, and plenty to put a smile on the face of a fan. I was disappointed in the video quality, it was apparently taken from a well used and faded film. Plenty of scratches are visible, the colors are very faded, and scenes with the Beatles in white tuxes are terribly washed out. HOWEVER, if you already have everything else of theirs, you may yet enjoy some of this video. If nothing else, see where the band ""Death Cab for Cutie"" got their name."
3,Flawed but magical,"Largely a project of Paul McCartney's, (who was advised to junk it but refused) this hour long travelogue was savaged upon it's release to television. Occasionally dull and more often than not disjointed, the musical sequences save the day, and you won't see a performance of ""I Am The Walrus"" anywhere else. Film seems to hold up much better today in the age of music videos and as a landmark of 1960's psychadelia. Beatle fans and 1960's buffs are sure to enjoy this more than a casual viewer."
5,BEST BEATLES FILM EVER!,"This is probably the oddest film ever created But on the 3rd or 4th time veiwing it,it slowly becomes your FAVORITE beatles film.(especially if your favorite Beatles year is 1967)."
5,Wink Wink,"This is one of the Beatles' best kept secrets. If you don't understand it, don't try, it won't make sense. But if you know whats going on, you won't be dissappointed.I highly recommend this movie (for some)."
3,"Great movie, not so good quality.",this movie is great but the picture quality is not that good. You get what you pay for.
2,Not Magical At All,"Hold off on buying this DVD in name only and wait for an authorized version not an obviously and poorly copied reproduction of a faded master tape. This is a waste of an otherwise entertaining and whimsical romp through the Beatles psychedelic stage in their musical career. However, the only real trippy thing about this is the LSD quality of the disc as if someone dropped some really bad acid on it while copying it. Dave"
2,Never have I hated a movie I wanted to love so much...,"Never have I hated a movie I wanted to love so much...The quality is less than poor, story unintelligable, the only good thing is the music. Even that is less than par, considering the scenes that they are incorparated with. I'm sorry, Beatles, truly I am."
1,I love the Beatles but his is crap,"I love The Beatles but this is crap. I bought this to watch 'I am the Walrus,''The Fool on the Hill' and 'Your Mother Should Know.' The video quality is miserable. Its to bright and washes out the details. Do Not Buy. You'll be disappointed."
3,Tragical Mystery Tour,"Even for die hard Beatles fans, MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR is very hard to watch. LET IT BE is way easier to watch than this. It is very disjointed and confusing. When it was first aired on the BBC, it was shown in black and white so, it must have been even worse for the tele audience. It's great to see the four Beatles together, however, apart from the musical sequences, there isn't much here. The bus tour isn't very interesting, the other characters besides the Beatles are repulsive, and there really isn't a story or plot. In the BEATLES ANTHOLOGY, Paul McCartney mentions that film students, who went on to become some of the top directors in the industry, took great notice of this film...I don't think so. Luckily, A HARD DAY'S NIGHT and HELP! are out there to help people forget about one of the Beatles' flops!!"
1,Magical or Tragical,"Well as far as a film goes this is pretty stupid. However, I own a copy & would never trade it in.I'm a Beatles fan - & if I look at this not as a film but as a collection of music videos then it's well worth it - especially for ""I am the Walrus"".There's no screenwritting credits for this because there was no real script. Paul McCartney & Ringo Starr decided to fill a bus with interesting people - & film it - & wait for the magic to happen.The magic never happened in so far that a 'movie' didn't emerge - just a lot of disjointed imagery.But this is a must for a Beatles nut like myself."
1,Magical Mystery Tour DVD should have been remastered,"I love the Beatles! And, I have this movie on VHS tape. I'm trying to slowly replace some of my favorite tapes with DVDs. I opened the DVD yesterday and went straight to ""Your Mother Should Know"" because I love seeing the Fab 4 in their white tails coming down that large staircase. Well, keep the VHS tape and don't bother to get the DVD; I could not see any of the faces of the Beatles or even of the crowd. The picture was so washed out - grainy - blurry - couldn't see their faces as I said - and had a slightly out-of-focus look.Would someone come out with a DVD that is really remastered???The Beatles - Magical Mystery Tour"
2,Serious remastering required. Apple get to it!!,"It's a shame, that this historical little film is languishing in people's collections, in poor copies such as these. I knew when I ordered this film that it would be some fourth, seventh who knows how many generation copy of most probably a vhs copy from the 80's. The two stars I have given this are merely for the music.I love The Beatles and everything they recorded or filmed, and it really pisses me off as to how Apple can allow this film to be remembered this way.Fans such as I know there is an original negative in existence, because we saw the virtually pristine footage of this film in the Beatles Anthology.Come on Apple, chop, chop, the fans deserve it..No actually the world deserves it!!"
1,Buyer beware!,"This dvd is not a good investment. It looks like it's been copied from a bad copy. I bought one of these and almost threw it away. I resisted the urge, but it's almost unwatchable, the picture is so distorted.The best course of action in acquiring Magical Mystery Tour is to find one of the VHS versions that are an actual Apple product. The movie is a stretch (even for die hard fans), but those VHS versions can be found in good shape, and let you see it clearly."
3,"Movie is fun for fans, but skip this (probably illegal) copy","My three-star rating is based on the actual movie. If you are only a casual fan of the Beatles you are probably not going to care much for MMT. For diehard fans, though, it's a must. Being one of those diehards, I enjoy MMT quite a bit. After all, it's got the only video in existence of the Beatles performing numerous hits, including ""I am the Walrus."" HOWEVER....you probably don't want to bother buying this pirated copy. I bought one a few years back after my original, official-issue MMT dvd went missing. I was extremely disappointed in the very poor quality of the transfer. I guess you get what you pay for. Hopefully Apple will get on the ball and remaster and re-release this one, but considering they've been hemming and hawing on a reissue of Let it Be for a couple decades now, I wouldn't hold my breath."
2,Faded,"Poor quality video, not as I remember it, it appears the original must have deteriorated over the years.....but the songs are still great!"
4,Magical Mystery Tour Movie (DVD),"This is similar to all the other Beatles movies. The camera work is not great although there are some terrific special effects. The trac of ""I am the walrus"" is particularly fun to watch. The DVD does not have subtitles or captioning. Altogether, the movie is a an interesting psychedelic trip with the Fab Four, and a bus full of passengers, through the English Country Side."
3,Pobre,"Este material es muy pobre tanto como película como en la selección de canciones, entiendo que es el trabajo original realizado en el 68 por Lennon y Harrison y está cargado de esa inspiración que le otorgó la inmortalidad a los Beatles, pero realmente yo esperaba que en esta versión DVD pudiera ver mucho mas de los tantos buenos trabajos que estos realizaron, parece mentira que sea tan dificil conseguir algo mejor o mas completo, por ejemplo algo como un Best Of The Beatles Live! in DVD."
3,"Nice,But Not The Beatles' Best Work","The Music And John's ""I Am The Walrus""Bit Was Okay.The Rest Was Just,Weird! ""Help!""Or,""A Hard Day's Night""Are My Fave Beatles Movies.I'll Go With The Mop-Top,And I'll Go With The Silly Antics,But It's Getting A Little Outta Whack.Nice Try,Guys."
2,Yuck! How could the Beatles release this garbage?,"The ONLY good thing about ""Magical Mystery Tour"" is the music! The Beatles were incapable of producing a poor soundtrack. But this mini-movie was horrible, even if you're one of those who loves the Fab Four! Terrible plot, no acting. The best part: ""I am the Walrus"", the first-ever music video in the classic mode."
3,Do not watch unless intoxicated,"I watched this film in an altered state of consciousness with my friends S. and T., and we throughly enjoyed it. The next day, my friend S. shows the scene preceding ""Fool on the Hill"" to E. to demonstrate its genius, only to realize how terrible this film is.On the other hand, I still have good memories of the movie, especially the bit featuring George Harrison."
2,dreck magical???,was ist das denn für einen blöden Film? die könnten doch nicht wie Sie einen Filmdrehen sollen?For die hard beatle fan only!
2,Bonzo Dog Doo Dah Band,"There are two reasons to watch this movie. The first is that you love the Beatles so much that anything they ever did, including bowel movements like this film, fascinate you. The second is to see Vivian Stanshall sing ""Death Cab for Cutie."" This is the only good scene in the film. It is not worth watching the whole film, however, so don't do that. Fast forward to the ""tent scene,"" watch it, and remove the DVD from your player. You're done. It is incredible that the Beatles, the greatest Rock act ever, are upstaged in their own movie. At least we get to see the Bonzo Dog Band."
1,too small,These covers are too small for chairs we have had for decades. Maybe the newer chairs are smaller. Don't know anything else because I didn't actually see them.
4,The Vampire Lestat ...The Complete Vampire Chronicles,"It starts off very interesting... The Vampire Lestat is who I related to the most. His warmth, and wickedness at the same time is really inspiring. I loved Queen of the damned, the different characters like baby Jenks, and the twins was nothing short of spellbinding. I totally recommend these books to the avid horror reader."
5,HOORAY FOR THE QUEEN OF THE DAMNED,"I have been an avid and keen fan of the vampire chronicles ever since I was browsing in a book store nine years ago.I was hooked the moment I opened the first page of ""Interview with the vampire"",after I had read this first instalment of the vampire chronicles,I couldn't wait to get my hands on the next book.In this series my favourite story is ""The Queen of the Damned"".Anne Rice is my favourite author,I don't just love the vampire chronicles,but all of the Anne Rice classics."
5,One of the greats!,I have read it several times. Anne Rice is the true Queen of Vampire Lore. I love it every time I read it. I definately recommend it to all new readers of vampire fiction.
5,"4 1/2 stars, really....","Interview With the Vampire is the only reason this set gets 4 and 1/2 stars... the other three books are outstanding! There is a reason that Lestat, not Louis, becomes the main character of the series. He is so much more enjoyable, and the writing style of the other three books is much more engaging. Still, Interview is not a bad book... it just can't live up to Lestat!"
5,the best book I've ever read,This book kept me involved from the very beginning it made me feel as if I was part of the book. Finishing it made me feel as if I was losing a good friend this is the best book I've ever read I can't wait to read her others.
5,SOME OF THE GREATEST BOOKS EVER WRITTEN,"INTERVIEW is excellent, and THE VAMPIRE LESTAT is awesome. QUEEN gets a little boring towards the end, but still read it, it's interesting. TALE OF THE BODY THIEF gets it going again, and it's very, Very, VERY weird. I love them all!"
5,14-YEAR OLD LOVES BOOK,"I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE AND I LOVE IT,IT IS GETTING REALLY INTERESTING. WHEN I FINISH THE SET I PLAN TO BUY HER OTHER BOOKS AND SERIES OF BOOKS SHE WILL PUBLISH."
5,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!,"This book is definately a must to be read by someone who would like to know or somehow fantasize on how the immortals (vampires) live or came about. It makes you want to cry out to all the immortal beings out there to take you, befriend you and be your companion and wait to be awed by them. It will battle your mind and spirit to choose your desire and to distinguish between black and white,fact or fictionl. Emotionally driven and suspenseful and I must add, it is great to picture Brad Pitt as Louis-the depressed and mentally tortured vampire."
5,The bestest books I've ever read,"I read these books all last year and loved them soooo much, I am thinking about ordering them again because my books are so worn out from reading them so many times! They are exactly my kind of books and since my last year, on my 14th birthday when I got interview with the vampire I've read all the vampire chronicles, the vampire armand, pandora and just started the vampire vittorio, which Igot a few days ago for my 15th b-day and already love it!, her books are the bestest ever I think! ~*Stacy*~"
4,I ACTUALLY FELT LIKE I WAS THERE !!!!,"Rice's descriptive and vivid choice of words is just spectacular As she takes us through the 15th century New Orleans!I fell in love with New Orleans after this book and had to visit there. Also the way she describes the characters and what they're going through,you feel their pain,temptation,and fear.Rice is a genius when it to the ""Dark World"" of vampires!"
5,A horror novel you wouldn't want to read at night,"The Vampire Lestat, by Anne Rice is one of the most scariest vampire novels I read. The novel is about Lestat's life, and hoe he bacame what he is today. The writer uses foreshadowing at one piont of the book, which makes it nerve racking. The most scariest part was when he mentions "" The Presence "". This reminds me of a freddy movie where you have a dream about him, and it happens. He appears from no where and strikes you with his vicious claws of blades. "" The Presence is some what similar. At frist they are afraid to fight Lestat, until all of them came at once, similar to a Freddy movie. I feel that all of Anne Rice's novels has a certain kind of horror to it. It always relate to another character in one of the chronicles. i would recommend this book to anyone who can stand having nightmares about vampires."
2,what people think they know about vampires,"vampires are not like the one in the book, they are many things but not that. Vampires come in many colors, like pink and yellow and the number one vampire is blue. He is the number one vampire since he is the fastest thing ever. He one the olympics twice in one second. Vampires live in tube slides and play houses, usually at toys-r-us. That is why your hair sticks up when you go in them. vampire victims have ornage shoes. Vampires like to hang on the sides of aireplanes. There are no vampires south of Washington DC. That's why i think this book is dumb."
1,not even a vampire story,"got to be the worst book i ever read, read the first one, half of second couldnt take it anymore,so slow and stupid, what a waste of paper, if your a vampire fan, do yourself a favor read something else, like midnight mass, from fpaul wilson, this is way to out there, complicated, and stupid"
5,Absolutely Incredible-Each one getting Better!,"I have recommended Anne Rice to all of my family and friends, and will continue to do so until I drop! She is a wonderfully talented author and has continuously managed to draw me into book after book. I have just recently completed The Vampire Chronicles and I cant stop thinking and talking about them. Each novel is magically written and so very descriptive, I feel like I learn something new everytime I pick up one of her books. ENCORE MS. RICE!"
4,Great Books,"I just started reading ""Interview with the Vampire"". I like the book a lot so far. I really like vampire books. The book in very detailed into the life of a vampire. I am excited to read the rest of the Vampire Chronicles series."
3,anne rice,Richly written. Not really suspenseful. Anne Rice is a good author. Some of the male characters seem a little feminine.
3,Classic,"These books run a little long, but they are so well written and DO get better at the end. You feel like you have developed a relationship with the characters."
3,Needs more plot!!,"Interview and Lestat are _wonderful_ with shocking sentuality, but stop there! the rest of Anne Rice's books are formulaic. A teeny bit of story and too much history made them unbearable. The Lasher series is even worse."
2,Repetitive,"It is enough to read one book from ""Vampire Chronicles"" series, because things get repetitive. I am now into the fifth, ""Memnoch the Devil"", and I don't know if I will ever finish it. All emotions of vampires can be summed up in one: love/hate, hate/love, which emotion leads one vampire, usually Lestat, into making another vampire.... Plots are easy to guess from the outset, language - excessive, unclear,confusing. Highly overrated."
3,"Good but murky reading, check out the other Rice (JEFF)","I suspect I'd like this series better if it didn't go on and on as it does. Much like Jean Auel's Alya series it's wonderful at times but someday, sometime - get to the point!Someone else suggested checking out Interview with the Vampire from your library. If you love it, then it probably makes sense to get this box set.Actually it is Jeff Rice who has written the best vampire story of the 20th century. The Night Stalker (original title, The Kolchak Tapes) wipes the floor with Anne Rice's murky stuff. If you don't believe me ask Richard Matheson! (He fell all over himself to condense the book into the TV movie screenplay.) Superb, crisp writing - I wish (Jeff) Rice had more novels available."
2,2 of 4 ain't bad...,"Vampire and Lestat are excellent books. Startling, exciting, and dramatic tales.Queen and the Body are much inferior to the first two - though if you have not yet read Vampire/Lestat then I am sure nothing I write will prevent you from reading at least Queen..."
1,Horrible,"I received this book set and read the first book. When I started to read the second book ""The Vampire Lestat"" I saw that the first 102 pages are missing! So now I have to re-order this book before I can finish the series. The seller had to know that these pages were missing."
5,Used often,"I was introduced to this book while serving in the PA National Guard. It was used extensively in the Guard. I purchased a copy to use in my government job and the state's child welfare training program. Scholtes, et al. provide clear step by step instruction and useful tools for teaming, quality control, and project management."
5,"Medical Herbalism, David Hoffmann","This is a fantastic resource for students and the like. It has a great layout, incorporating illnesses and body systems, herbal actions, a materia medica and many other great categories. It is well referenced and uses a wide range of information."
5,For the serious student,This book is excellent. It has tons of information that you would have a difficult time finding elsewhere. I recommend it for all serious students of herbology.
4,Lotus Guide magazine,"We often forget that most pharmaceutical medicines were discovered in herbs originally. However, we are quickly finding out that removing individual molecules from the natural combinations that nature has prepared often leads to a variety of health problems. At 665 pages this is an excellent in-depth look at how to use herbs medicinally to treat any variety of health problems. A must for healthcare practitioners or anyone wanting to take more control over their own health.Dhara Lemos, Lotus Guide"
1,Hilary Duff...??,"In my opinion, this doll doesn't look like Hilary at all! The face on this doll looks older than Hilary Duff herself. Hilary Duff is so beautiful, and these dolls are going to make people think that she isn't! When my mom and i went to look at dolls, she said ""What is this doll?"" I said ""Oh, thats the new Hilary Duff one"", and she says ""This makes Hilary Duff look WAYY older than she is!"" It is the truth. Whoever Hil hired to make these dolls doesn't know how beautiful she REALLY is!!"
2,Hilary Duff? No Way!,"This doll does NOT look like Hilary Duff! It is ugly, and stupid looking. It looks like you could barely touch it, and it would fall apart. At least this doll just looks like she would be saying, ""Uh, duh, like, uh, doi, uh?"". The Lizzie McGuire dolls look like they're about to bite your head off!"
3,I thought this would hold the deep red but..,"Because the was a thick paste, I thought it would require less coloring to get the deep red I wanted. Seems that I needed a great deal, anyway. So, I consider it as average."
5,Great for beginners and experienced users too!,"This video is fantastic for users new to the Handspring experience. I bought it for my wife to go along with the Handspring I got her for Christmas. It had her up and running in no time, and I learned a few tips as well! This is a must-have to complement any Handspring purchase."
2,"cute enough, but...","Every 20 year old Californian I know has reccomended this book. It was a lot of fun, and a fast read, but a month after reading it, I had to strain to remember anything about it. I don't think you will find this book particularly memorable unless you can relate to the main character -- ie. fashion obsessed, boy crazy, rampant extrovert."
5,Excelent and amazingly interesting!,"This book was my favorite book ever! It was just really interesting, and Abbie(the main charactor) was a great person who was discovering herself. She realized that she always picked looks over intelligence when it came to guys, and was trying to become less shallow. Of course she doesn't change and winds up getting her heart broken by the cute guy. This book is a TOTAL must!!! It was so excellent that I never once put it down. Please, I definetly recamend that you read it!"
1,Boring,"I couldn't get past Chapter 6. Abbie is pathetic. Just when you think you have her figured out, something will be stated that completely changes your perception of her. However, that statement never has basis anywhere else in the book, and doesn't fit in with Abbie's personality. The book itself is not very funny, and not at all a gripping read. I do not recommend it."
2,Dissapointing ending. . .,"I started off really, really liking this book. Yet, when I got to the ending, I was completely unsatisfied. I'll try not to give this away, but Abbie waited so long to do what I thought she always should have, but how it happened was weak, and afterwards, the book was a bit of a drag. I think the author went on too long about the details of the clothes in the fashion show. This is great for those that love fashion, but it seemed to me that Julie Taylor just wanted to shove it in somewhere because it was an interest of hers . I also knew all along the problem with her design teacher, it was so easy to see that one coming. Don't get me wrong though, this was a fun story and I would recommend it if you are looking for an easy read."
5,A must for UFO Schenker Fans,"I was very happy and surprised at the amount of live video clips in this DVD. It really caters to the true fans of UFO, and especially Michael Schenker fans. It is really better than I expected, and I expected a lot.Steve Funderburg"
5,classic hard rock lives.,"I had this one on VHS and the dvd version is better. I found no defaults in the sound or quality of the the vintage 1970's footage. However the sound isn't like a newly recorded digital version. We are lucky to get to see any of this stuff, thankfully it was still around as many tv producers destroyed their tapes back in those days.Ufo is one of the greatest hard rock bands of all time and they continue with new releases like 'The visitor"" to create fantastic music that should please any rock fan. You get interviews and great songs from the golden era of the band on this dvd and that's enough for me."
3,When Schenker ruled the guitar world.,I'll give this DVD 3 stars for the clips with Schenker. The rest is crap. Picture & sound is dated but ok.
1,Total waste of money,This DVD has a very bad picture and even worse audio. Don't waste your money. I would like my money back.
2,Too hot to Handle DVD,"well, for Michael Schenker fans I guess the best part of this DVD is watching UFO playing Ligths out,let it roll,too hot to handle,this kids,and out in the streets but the rest is more info. no rock botton or love to love even though is on the list and you get to hear from Phil,Pete and Michael.This part of this DVD and the part of UFO world greatest albums(DVD)strangers in the night could have been great put together without the extra stuff that was worthless.ROCK ON, (MSG/UFO fan)"
2,Not enough Schenker!,"I bought this expecting more Schenker footage, and instead, I got a VHS-quality DVD with only seven songs featuring Michael (Rock Bottom and Doctor Doctor, their two biggest ""hits"", not even amongst the MS cuts!), and of pretty poor sound and picture quality. To me, UFO without Schenker is like Led Zeppelin without Jimmy Page (and this from someone who actually saw the Vinnie Moore line-up this summer). So, I was pretty disappointed. Thankfully, Michael's blistering solos cut through the hissy sound pretty well, and if you're like me, you've waited forever to see Schenker perform with UFO, so in that sense, it might be worth it to own."
3,Incredibly difficult read but worth it,"As a philosophy major specializing in ethics, I found this book very insightful for expert ethics majors looking for a condensed version of Christian based ethics. The book is split into several different parts. 1 - Defining biblical and Christian/Judeo ethics, 2 - early church ethics, 3 - clement of alexadria, st augustine, monasticism, mysticism, aquinas, luther, calvin, puritinism, quakerism, butler, wesley, edwards, kierkegaard, rauchenbusch, and 4 - the various differences between Roman Catholic and Protestant ethics. Historical and fundamental book for ethics study."
2,Useless in treating ADHD,"We bought this book trying to find drug-free way to stop our son's ADHD, but it turned out to be useless. Most of the book is general information about the signs of ADHD, statistics and classification of methods of correction. We knew all this things even without this book. There was too little information about how to actually help your child. Don't waist money. You can find more information in Internet."
1,Too much talkity-talk,"Unlike 1967's Report from Hoople, the talk in this one is really annoying. Had it just been the Professor talking I would have liked it, but his co-hosts have to go. 25 minutes of good PDQ Bach tunes and 35 minutes of lame blather I couldn't even sit through once."
3,How to run a classical music station for fun and...well...,A typical(?) evening on Southern North Dakota's favorite(?) radio station. Ol' Professore Pete brings in a pair of accomplices in this outrage of some of the more sedate but none the less delightfully ridiculous pieces...the Safe Sextet of the lesser known orchestral instruments is a kick...but beware of the dangers of OD'ing on Pachabel!
3,Not My Favorite,"This is a satire of the annoying disc jockey ""personalities"" who are all-too-apparent on radio today. As is so often the case with this sort of satire, it mimicks what its mocking a little too closely while not providing enough in the way of humor. There are some good pieces, like the PDQ Bach folksongs, but the music faded to the background when viewed alongside the obnoxious radio personalities. Some of it, was not only annoying, but kind of poinless, like the Elvis parody. I'm a huge fan of PDQ, but this album was too much even for me."
1,"really elementary. good for school children, perhaps","this book only uses one form of braiding, and spends pages explaining how to do it -- the same braids we all learned as children, for pigtails. Then the patterns are gussied up with beads but there's nothing here the rankest beginner wouldn't invent for onesself -- nothing new. A pity."
1,Itty bitty pictures,"Loretta wishes you ""good luck"" at the outset and you'll certainly need it. The photos are too tiny to distinguish any detail. I recommend that this book go back to the publisher to have the wire shown in its actual size. Pare down the explanations because bigger pictures could show more. In its current state, the book is fairly useless to learn wire wrapping techniques."
5,"If you like Argentinian folklore, you need to listen to this","Chalchaleros have been around for over 50 years, and this is truly a collection of their best work. A great value for all the songs compiled here; I have been a fan for over 20 years and I highly recommend it."
2,"With a little bit more R&D, this could have been a good product","As others have said, this is a pretty cheaply made product. Thought I'd give it a chance anyway and bought one. Once I had it in hand, I had high hopes for it because the grips actually felt pretty nice. The problem is that the PSP doesn't lock into it well. Game has to be situated perfectly to lock in at all, but even then, it slides out easily with normal game play. There are 2 tabs on the top and two on the bottom, but something should have been done to prevent side to side movement.I'm gonna try other products to see if I can find one the works well. I'd advise to stay away from this."
3,Comfortable but cheap,"This product is a true ""you get what you pay for""PROS:Very comfortable: Makes playing games for a long time easier on the hands.Easy to use: PSP Slim slides right in, very easy to understand.Portable: It collapses down so it doesn't take up much room when not being used.CONS:Cheap Material: It works well until you give it the slightest drop, the hinges will break off if your PSP is inside.Function: Makes it hard to switch out games with ease as it blocks the back of your PSP. Though your ""custom"" psps wont have a problem with this.Function 2: The grips will also collapse if you put too much pressure on them while playing (for those who get...intense while playing)Final:This is a cheap solution to curb hand cramps while playing your psp, other options are out there but are more expensive. I would only recommend this to you if you are on a low budget and don't mind a few downsides."
1,CHEAP,The first thing I noticed was that it felt really cheap. Stay away from this if you got a PSP Slim or 3000 (it doesn't hold it well).Overall I'm very disappointed with this purchase.
2,Doesn't fit PSP-3000,"This grip does not fit the PSP-3000 (the grip is much too large). It doesn't say anywhere in the description that it won't fit either. Other than that, yes it is plastic and ""cheap"" but it's also inexpensive.Regardless, don't buy this if you have a PSP-3000."
3,Dosn't fit the PSP 3000,"This is a good idea. But The PSP 3000 is too thin to ""clip""into place so it just rattles around in grips. It looks like this was made for the original PSP. It would have been nice if they had that in the description."
1,Malisimo,"No compres esta porqueria, al segundo dia de usarlo se rompio un agarradero, es un engaño..."
4,interesting movie,"Was a well done picture of the life of two very interesting historical figures. Very entertaining and the scenes were very beautiful, but may not be actually true to history. May have been some a little historical fiction involved, but I did enjoy it very much"
4,Moving drama,Kenneth Branagh shines in this biopic telling how he began his recupperation and the events that would launch him into the Oval Office. The reason why I knock a star off is that I feel this to be the first act in a grander story that should have been told with it. FDR is a true American hero and this film rectifies any previous glossing over of his time at Warm Springs.
4,Good acting by Kenneth Branagh and Cynthia Nixon(Sex and the City) as the Roosevelts.,"It's about when Franklin Delano Roosevelt came down with polio and how he attempted to recover by using natural hot springs water at a broken down resort in Georgia. The plot didn't try to sugar coat FDR or his wife Eleanor. They were shown to be flawed human beings who trudge through life like the rest of us, learning to cope with problems like most of us do. It made me sad to see the fear and discrimination toward polio victims. One scene was heartbreaking where a young man was in the baggage car, chair tipped over with him in it, and hasn't ate for two days! Thankfully, there are laws protecting the disabled today.Of course, FDR never walked again but that didn't stop him from becoming one of the greatest presidents of the USA."
3,DIRT BIKE,"The extra live tracks from this Buffalo based punk influenced band seem like another band entirely, a more assured, slightly deranged sound somewhere between garage punk and dirt-glam progessive. The studio tracks suffer from an inferior sound quality where guitar and vocals sound hollow, high and above the cool background wash of music. I like the Count Chocula and Boo-Berry samples, and the lead vocals, at first indiscriminate and anonymous, become familiar and friendly like running into a good old friend on a city street. Great band name, maybe from a 1970s Saturday morning cartoon, and perfect homage to The Clash's ""Garageland"" in the live track, ""Lower East Side""."
3,I know I'm going to annoy a few people but...,"This CD is very amusing. It reminds me of Radio Jordan - The English station Broadcasting from Amman Jordan & is recieved here & different cities around Israel & the PA... You see, they played these sorts of instrumentals all the time. Anything they could get their hands on - Yani, Kenny G, and lots of this stuff... so this is kinda like Radio Jordan... but in a good way! :-)"
4,Great Deal,Found this item 'used' on Amazon and I couldn't find it anywhere else. the item came new in the wrapper
1,Terrible,"Katchen's playing is riddled with errors, and the soundquality is poor. Stick with the Richter recording."
2,unhappy and bad service,"Okay. I love these shoes. I have worn this model for years. Please get them.But not from this seller. I ordered a size 6.5 and they sent an 11.5. When I sent them back, their form for returns included a choice for exchange and the reason. I told them on this form that the size was wrong. I heard nothing for quite a while.Finally I got an email saying that I had been given a refund. Well that was nice but I wanted an exchange. I wrote them back asking about that. They said they cannot do exchanges since all their stock is on ebay. Okay. Fine. But why didn't they say that in their description that they don't do exchanges? And if they are all on ebay, how come you can get them on Amazon?Anyway, I did finally find my shoes and they will arrive soon - from another seller. Two months it took from my first order and I really will not work with this company again."
4,Very comforatble running shoe,"I recently purchased this shoe after a friend of mine recommended ASICS shoes to me. This is my first pair of running shoes and I am very pleased with it. The shoes were very comfortable from the day one.One comment that I have about the shoe is that they are quite narrow in the front. I have wide feet and would have prefferred a little wider shoe. I worked out fine for me, however, because I had purchased 1/2 size longer than what I usually wear.Overall, I am very happy with this pair and would recommend it."
3,a different kinda' music,I wasn't too wild about the cd at first. I bought it because of two songs that I heard on christian radio.After listening to it a few times it really grew on me and now I love it.
5,I just got the cd,"Just recieved the Cd in the mail. And I love it! It's a cross for me between India Arie, and Nelly Frutado on a few songs. Yet she has her own style in most others. I personally have found my new favourite Gospel artist"
5,Ayiesha...energetic and fun!,Don't listen to this cd in your car unless you don't care if people stare while you sing and dance! :) I can't sit still with this music playing... I love it. The lyrics are catchy and full of truth.
4,excellent,"Been listening to the album non stop in my car during my commute. I love it. A&R guys will be all over the radio friendly ballad ""Sunday ""."
3,Right order Wrong CD,"I know it's probably an innocent mistake but...the CD I ordered was ""My Song"", the CD I received was ""Virtuoso""! The CD jacket was ""My Song"" which means it was a simple mistake. So....I'm enjoying Virtuoso!"
3,"fabulous book, minuscule type","Such a great book (deserves 5 stars), but the type is way too small for me to get through even one page without having to put it aside in disgust (I would give it zero stars if Amazon let me). I split the difference and gave it 3 stars."
1,Don't Buy it!!,Purchased two of these and they BOTH stopped working after a short time. Don't buy these....look elsewhere! Much better options to be had! These are not good quality!
2,Disappointed,I was very disappointed with this CD. Dean and Frank sound drunk throughout most of the CD and the audience detracts from the songs.
3,Disappointed.,Picture is disceiving. It's too small to cover both table and chairs. We use it now for covering just the table and we had to patch the center hole.
4,EBB an FLOW!,"Great album by a band that is way under rated. These guys have excellent potential. Tight knit grooves...funky bass lines...and awesome guitar / drums / and brass! Definitely different than anything that i've heard put out in a long time!! very funky! I've seen these guys a couple of times in Baltimore at the old 8 x 10 and they jam! FEEDER and PORNO STAR are the 2 best tracks, but the whole album is great. See em live if you can!DAVE"
4,Good Jam here,"I really like this concert, with all three vocalist there all the good songs were sung, the band was on & tight. There were some complaints about the audience but who cares, it's really all about the music anyway. You'll like this one trust me. Be sure & read some of my reviews & pick out something U've never heard, U won't be dissapointed"
4,great performance,"This is one of the better live DVD""s I have seen. Great sound and picture quality. Truly one of the Doobi's best performances. Nice to see Micheal MacDonald doing his song, no-one does it better."
4,This Concert Rocks!,"Having heard the Doobies on record from their beginnings in the 70's of course I was very familiar with their sound and style. I had never seen them in concert until I requested and received Rockin' Down The Highway on DVD. Just buy this DVD. Whether you like the Doobie Brothers or not,if you like rock and roll you're sure to be as pleased as I was.These guys know how to rock!! It's a must have for your collection,and for $12.00 a real bargain. JB"
5,DOOBIES LIVE ROCKS!,This is one of the best concert DVD's in my collection. Sound and lighting for this concert are awesome. This is the best of the Doobies at their best. The playing and vocals are fantastic. A must have!
2,Audio not synchronized with video,"I was really looking forward to seeing this dvd as i have the audio (CDs), but i was disappointed to notice that the audio does not synchronize with the video. I hope Amazon will have the policy in place to replace the copy that was shipped tot me. Being a musician and a concert player it is very disturbing having to watch a musician make a move and hear the sound after two seconds.Reginaldo Carolina (received the dvd this afternoon - April 11, 2011)."
3,not quite the nostalgia Doobies I was seeking,some of the good hits (and misses) on this but I would still like to see the earlier Doobies with all the great hits
5,Ditto...But Tiran Porter didn't sing that part...,"Mega dittoes that this is a great concert, well performed by all. But one reviewer needs to clear the fog from their early '70s memory...Tiran Porter did not sing the ""Jesus, he's my friend..."" part on the studio version of ""Jesus is just alright."" It was sung by Pat Simmons, and I don't know why he doesn't sing it live. Maybe they're just trying to get Cornelius Bumpus' voice (which is excellent) into the lead vocal mix! Great show!!"
5,Great background music for quiet times,A really beautiful collection that is perfect for ending the day with. Lovely songs that are easy to listen to and help create a peaceful state of mind.
1,Reader beware,"Beware of this book. Loftus is not a trauma expert. If she were, she would acknowledge that normal memory and traumatic memory are different creatures; they work differently and involve different areas of the brain. As a fellow lawyer, I am disquieted by the one-sided, misguided, and truly heavy-handed application of information from the irrelevant fields of ordinary memory and eyewitness testimony. The capacity is too great to hurt people already hurt and to harm the causes of law, jurisprudence, and justice.Every lawyer must be skeptical about all evidence, and one must be on guard for therapeutic contamination. (Victims want to be secure in their memories, too. They don't want inept therapists misleading them.) Loftus is right to point out obvious dangers. This book, however, verges on zealotry in not factoring in the venerable body of reliable study on post-traumatic amnesias. One wonders why. Don't read this book without reading work by acknowledged traumatic memory experts."
1,Who`s she working for?,"This jewish author is obviously working for rich powerful evil men in high up places who run illegal establishments for themselves and their rich millionaire buddies. So now when a child comes forward and says that they were abused by a rich famous person, the offender can now get off because the offender can claim this ""false"" memory garbage. Wake up people and don`t be fooled by this woman and her lies. She`s protecting evil men in high up places. This woman author is also a skeptic. But she wasn`t skeptical of the people who claimed that John Demjanjuk was Ivan The Terrible."
5,Bobby Short at His Best,"Owning nearly all of Bobby Short's albums, this is the one I play the most. I love his style! He recorded at an actual preformance which added more intimacy to the of the album."
1,Nearly useless.,Way out-of-date. Not your fault as it was purchased due to potential supervisor's recommendation. Most techniques in this book have been obsolete for 20+ years.
5,Crisp Recording of a Classic Classical Piece,"I admit, I am no classical expert, or even novice, for that matter. In my view, one of the purposes of music is to emotionally impact the listener. Based on that simplistic standard, this recording is impressively successful.A remastering of a 1970s recording, the CD is crisp and vibrant. The orchestra plays as one, and Previn's leadership of the group is evident.Everything comes together on this CD for an energizing emotional experience."
4,Richard's review.,I have heard at least six other versions of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana this wouldhave to be one of the best one's. RvT
2,Not the best recording,"While doing research for my Master's dissertation which was on Carmina Burana, I did a comparative study of several Carmina Burana recordings: this one in my opinion was among the worst. While the singing and orchestral playing is very solid, the tempos are largely too slow to capture the intensity of emotion expected by modern audiences of this peice, having heard it excerpted by so many Hollywood films. Previn's approach to conducting somehow seems to remove a lot of the excitement and lustre of this incredible composition: I strongly recommend a different recording, such as Levine or Eugene Jochum."
1,MP3 download is defective DON'T BUY,"I just downloaded the mp3 version of he is album. It is defective, with pops, clicks and 1-second gaps. These defects are not an artifact of downloading -- these are cheap recordings reproducing the defects of old 78-rmp platters. The performances are wonderful, but just unlistenable."
3,Very colorful,I ordered the green color which is very vibrant and looks great on my media player. The armband accessory is just a piece of elastic with velcro - not very well made.
3,zen v plus skin,Does what it's supposed to do and protect the mp3 player. The only flaw is the front opening for the joystick is a bit small and probably should be opened up more.Overall pretty good though.
5,teen bible,"Great book, very good for youth. Puts it in their language, helps them find what they are looking for easily. This book was in perfect condition, no problems."
4,Christopher,"These boys have made a spectacular release with their new album ""Ghosts."" In a combination of melodic swinging vocals, rhythmic drum beats, and a great bass tune, the music you get from Sleeping at Last takes you to another place. If you like the relaxing and energizing mix in this album, try other artists such as Switchfoot and Bleu."
5,Nice job guys!! Great Chicago rock.,"This is a great sounding CD with tons of quality playing put into it. These guys are one of the hardest woking bands I have ever known and it pays off. I love the piano and strings and Ryan's vocals and lyrics are ever improving. I'm a huge fan of the well recorded drum sounds and tight playing on this CD by Chad. Dan got some sweet bass sounds as well. Do you still have that carpet covered monster of a bass amp? I really dig the tempo on Ghosts, not at all what I was expecting from the intro. Skeletons of something more has some really big sounds from the whole band. I'm very happy this album was made good work guys.Steve Pierog"
2,s' ok,"It's not bad. Certainly not a ""risk taking"" sound here. Lyrically it is trying to sound smart, use of imagery feels like a bad childrens book. The music is close to smashing pumpkins, but why not just listen to them. I don't know, I work at a record store and am jaded. I know a lot of people have come in for it. It just seems like another safe bet for the record companies to make money on, instead of signing a band that will break new ground. Although, I could be eating those words in a couple of years."
1,One-Hit wonder?,"I bought this cd because I read on the Internet that Billy Corgan was the one who had discovered this band, and I thought ""well, if Billy says these guys are good , it's sure they are"".When you play the cd you discover that the first song ""Say"" is a hit and a wonderful song that could have been written by Corgan himself. It reminds a lot of the Smashing Pumpkins best tunes, when they made songs like ""1979"", with the voice of O'Neal sounding similar to Bono of U2. Unfortunately, ""Say"" is an oasis in the middle of the whole record. In fact, I can't understand how this guys can make such a wonderful song and then run out of ideas for the rest of the album, because the level goes down with the next two songs, to finally touch the ground with the rest of the cd, which is full of sad and bored songs with empty and sometimes ridiculous lyrics. Maybe I am wrong, but I am afraid that Sleeping At Last will end up as a one-hit wonder."
5,Favorite Christmas Album,"If you like the smooth sounds of The Velvet Fog, then this album will not dissapoint. Just kick back and relax."
5,Sublime!,"Other reviewers have said it but let me add my vote: This is the best Christmas recording ever. In particular, his version of ""Christmastime is Here"" is achingly beautiful. My favorite, though, is a previously unrecorded gem he wrote called ""The Christmas Feeling."" It is a true classic: simple, understated and memorable, where every note and chord is exactly right. It deserves to be played alongside his more traditional hit, ""The Christmas Song."" It's every bit as good, maybe better."
3,Nice arrangements...,"I have to admit that I was disappointed with this recording. It's not terrible, but Mel was just not in very good voice and I cannot imagine myself wanting to replay most of these tracks next year. I did enjoy some of the more up-tempo numbers; but his voice on the ballads was not up to par. The orchestra was very good and I enjoyed the arrangements. They were perhaps a bit schmaltzy, but that works in this context. If I had to do it over again, I would have just downloaded the few tracks that I would want to hear again; but how can you tell which tracks are successful from only a thirty-second sample?"
3,Lacks Descption,"Because the Pocketjet and Pocketjet II printers were nearly identical, and because the Pocketjet 3 is sold in an ""engine"" only configuration, one is tempted to believe that all the bits and pieces of the earlier models should be reusable and one only needs to buy a new USB cable. Not so. Also, there doesn't seem to be any notification that the model is discontinued. If it had just been downward compatible with its earlier reincarnations we would have kept it. Instead we returned it and ordered a Pocketjet 6 from another company. There was some glitch in getting reimbursed but I think it is resolved now."
5,Shoah,Very poignant memoir that reminds us of the evil that exists in this world.Shoah: Journey from the Ashes : A Personal Story of Triumph over the Holocaust
2,"""You Mean We're at Least 50th Cousins?""","Lois Horowitz wrote a delightful, little book that had me both chuckling, and duly impressed, with the amazing connections between people. She motivated me to want to try this myself: tracking down my own collection of relatives, and leaving my children with a more developed sense of family - their family, our family.Her personal trials, errors, and successes, in the quest of family history, helped me believe I also could try my hand at this, and maybe it really is a do-able venture. Lois shows it can be as time-consuming and elaborate as I wish to make it. But, happily, it also can be as simple, direct, and informative as reality allows. It's all up to me.I look forward to providing my children, and other family members, with the information that gets discovered, and hope that they all will be blessed by the outcome. I'll let you know how it goes, after all, we're family; we're at least 50th cousins - maybe closer!"
2,no scientific back up,"Interesting ideas, but I think it's basically based on someones random notes of some personal experiences and observances than anything else. No explanations on why or any reasoning to do/eat those specific things other than because ""Breuss"" thinks they work. On top of it it's not Rudolph Breuss who wrote this booklet (it's not a book) but, someone who claimes that his notes were given to him before his death."
5,best medicne book i read so far,"this is a great book from a great man.the cancer protocol is just part of the book.there is many other great remedies in the book.including water treatments,infertility,Stuttering,back pain and more."
2,The Burgess cancer cure,Was a interesting read not really very definitive on how exactly to do the fast or what actually cures the ailment especially cancer needs to have a clearer protocol instead of so many testimonials .I was expecting a very exact and precise method for the forty two day fast.
5,The Bruce Cancer Cure,"The Bruess Cancer Cure gives an alternative option for dealing with cancer that apparently has had much success. It is simple and inexpensive. Testimonials from those who have applied this 42 day vegetable juice and herb tea fast and remain cancer free many years following, make this a worthwhile read for those looking for answers other than the conventional route of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation treatment."
3,"Soft neck collar, by Futuro","I purchased the collar as I needed some support for my neck while sleeping. It did help, however I had to stop using it due to it pressing on nerves in my neck. The price was a bargain. I looked at CVS and they wanted $18.00 for one."
2,Futuro Soft Cervical Collar,"This product is fair to support cervical area comfortably, the adjustable band in front area should be more wider for that reason to make it adjustable easily."
1,Great concept but it flat out didn't work,"I tried installing VTbook on two different laptop computers - both of which met the system requirements for the product - a Toshiba Satellite 2430 and a Toshiba Satellite A20. Both are running the most recent version of Windows XP. On the 2430, the installation CD would not install properly (nor would installation files downloaded from the internet). I would receive a message ""-PciSysPatch- Error: Cannot access system registry."" The vendor tech support helped me work around the installation issue, but it didn't seem successful. A monitor connected to the VTbook (either via DVI or VGA) would never display a thing. On the A20, the installation process went smoothly, but when I tried to activate the monitor in Display Settings, I received a ""blue screen of death"" and then my primary monitor went black. The vendor tech support was not able to solve the problem. I returned the product."
4,Lovely...,"Really lovely and calming visualization exercises for children. We are doing them with our 3 yr old and she loves them! It is great for when we are too tired to think of our own AND it has inspired us to make up our own. We like some from the book more than others, but we just skip the ones we don't like so much."
5,Really helps!,My eight-year old had terrible anxiety and bad dreams. This really seems to help him at bedtime! He really likes the book and the visualizations it gives him. He really does seem to sleep better after reading it.
3,great book,"One thing you can be certain,this book has nothing to do with religion and new age is certainly no religion, but aside from that... you can find some wonderfull ""stories"" to tell your children in bedtime that offers them the possibility to expand their heart... I found them really interesting as an opportunity to express themselves as compassionate towards all kind of beings... people, animals, plants... learning how to love and respect all kingdoms. Looking at the world we live in, I think this is one the most important things to teach our children."
1,DANGER! to Christian parents. Newage religion in disguise,Some schools are teaching this as secular relaxation. It is newage pagan and strongly antithetical to the Christian worldview. Avoid this at all costs.
2,Not his best,"Somewhat disappointed in this album. I wish I could say exactly ""why"", but I guess it just isn't the Ahmad Jamal I remembered."
2,Sadly agree,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer, the basket is flimsy, and the auto-shut off does not work unless you have used the Auto-on programmer. I left my house one day and forgot to shut it off, and came home to a house that smelled of burnt coffee to find a thin coating of sludge at the bottom of my coffeemaker. If I'd come home at all late that night it would have dried completely and possibly cracked the carafe, started a fire, or what I don't know - but I'm not willing to find out. The rest are design flaws but this is a serious safety flaw."
1,The worst coffeemaker I have ever owned,"I bought the Farberware 10 cup programmable coffeemaker because of the unique color (cobalt blue). I soon discovered that there were many design flaws. First, the carafe handle is extremely uncomfortable. It is concave with sharp edges that cut into your hand when the pot is full. Second, the filter basket does not ""snap"" closed. After being pushed to the close position, it pops back out a little and you are never sure if it is really closed. Third, this coffeemaker claims to have an ""auto shut-off"" feature, but this feature works only when you have turned the coffemaker on using the Auto Program feature. If you switch the coffeemaker on manually, the auto shut-off does not function. Fourth, grounds spill over the filter. I would not recommend this coffeemaker to anyone. Looking pretty in my kitchen is its only redeeming quality, and soon, it will look pretty in my trash can."
3,Functional,"I purchased this case 9 months ago. It serves it's purpose as far as holding my knives and other tools, however the velcro on the sides doesn't meet, forcing me to depend on the handle to keep the bag together. After 9 months, the velcro on the handle has worn out, forcing me to sew new velcro onto the handle."
5,Perfect for any Chef,"I have been cooking in restaurants for a decade now and needed a new roll bag for my tools. This bag contains various pockets and places to fit all your knives, spoons, tweezers, tongs and any other culinary tool you would need for convenient carrying. My only problem is now buying more things to fill up all the space in my new roll bag."
3,knife roll,"I bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it. He has some long knives, and they fit nicely in this case."
5,A Stunning Memoir,"Court of Memory is one of the finest memoirs I've ever read. James McConkey is an incredibly accomplished writer and thinker of great grace and empathy. I've been a voracious reader my whole life, and only discovered McConkey this winter, in a book about crafting memoirs edited by William Zinnser. Although he's a professor at Cornell, McConkey seems to be little known, and this is a terrible loss--he seems to me to be one of our finest living American writers. If I could single-handedly change this situation, Iwould!"
5,Perfect,I own a road bike and a mountain bike and this is the second seat kit that I have purchased. I have peace of mind known that when I am 20 plus miles from home that I can repair my bike and get back on the road home.
4,caitlin's big idea,"this book is about caitlin and how she is always getting into trouble. she tries to help out, but she always seems to mess everything up. first, she tries to get goat to mow grass and then she loses a very important project, she even messes up all of her mother's hard work. can caitlin ever make anything right?this book shows that even if you try, you might still fail, but if you continue trying, something good is bound to happen."
2,Dont bother -- go for classic Count.,"This album is a good Jazz swing album, don't get me wrong -- but it's not Real Basie. Frank Foster does a good job of directing this orchestra, and they really swing in some parts -- but other parts are so lacking that calling it Basie is almost an embarassment. The piano player, for example, seems to not even be able to improvise a single line without screwing up. There were a few piano solos where I actually felt bad for the guy. I was embarassed for him because he sounded so bad. If you are looking for classic Basie, then get another Count Basie album. This is basically a decent jazz swing album with ""Basie"" tacked onto it."
3,Caution! Extreme bass volumes may damage speakers,"This is an understatement. Track #15, the sound effects from twister, have much more base than the orginal or non dts recording. However, there seems to be a slight defect in the dts encoding. Track 15 caused some ""noise"" in my speakers tweeter even when the volume was turned way down on my stereo. I know this is uncommon, but I would not buy another DTS recording from Telarc due to this experience. I have read other reviews about other DTS recording from Telarc complaining about the lack of quality. Telarc produces, hands down, the best regular CD recording, but they seem to have problems doing the same impressive job with DTS recordings. This is the reason I gave it three stars."
2,Remarkably Unaffecting... dissapointing.,"Of all the incredible film compositions they could have recorded for this CD, the selection is mediocre stuff. The technical performance of the Cincinatti Pops is not in question; it's fine. Also, the music doesn't come together in any programatic way that makes you want to listen from beginning to end. The DTS 5.1 mix was equally unimpressive."
1,NOT SURROUND SOUND - THIS IS PCM STEREO SOUND ONLY!,"This CD does not have a DTS 5.1 audio track, it's just PCM stereo sound (standard CD quality). Beware if you're buying this CD thinking this is mastered in DTS, because it's not!"
3,"Okay, but not that great.","This is a pretty mediocre set. The only good reason to get his is for Saruman. The main parts are the back stand w/ Saruman's seat and the palantiri stand. The Gandalf isnt that great either. I'd use my money for the Bride of Kazadum instead (that has the Balrog, a good Gandalf, and a goblin archer)."
1,Not the best...,"Although this toy looked cool, it didn't stay together and it wound up being just a pile of peices that rarely got played with."
3,Funny Summer Reading if you can forgive the format,"I haven't read a book in this format (e-mails, letters, cards etc) since the suspense book THE FAN years ago and it still doesnt work very well. :) It was frustrating at first and it took me a long time to get ""into"" the book.I will give this a good review because as I kept reading I became more and more interseted in the escapades of the b movie actress Viola Chute and by the time all the ""twists and turns"" were revealed I laughed out loud at the resilience of her character. It was delicious satire.The ""Big secret"" we keep waiting for ends up to be a real snoozer but I enjoyed the unraveling of the story none the less.I still think PRINCESS PARAGON is his best book. (And not his most popular either)If you have not read a Robert Rodi book before I would suggest starting with FAG HAG and PRICESS PARAGON. (I only thought DRAG QUEEN was not worth reading)Enjoy but don't expect too much from this book."
2,i couldn't get through it,i could not get past the first 30 pages or so. i found it dull and the way that it flips back and forth between formats is distracting. i found it to be boring. i would not recommend this book.
3,"Different, fluffy but still entertaining","Robert Rodi weaves his tale in a novel, clever sort of way, stitching his story together with nothing but correspondences: e-mails, answering machine messages, letters, affidavits, whatever. Although it's a little hard to get into for the first 2 chapters or so, this method slowly but surely grows on you. The interesting bits really only come towards the middle of the book, but Rodi's style is snappy and interesting enough to keep your interest till then. It gets saccharine-sweet towards the very end, and the big climax isn't really *that* big after all, but you can almost forgive that, since the rest of the book is actually pretty decent."
4,Watercolor washes by a master,"Comprehensive guide to watercolor washes which includes an excellent range of examples, mostly of landscape subjects. Garcia is a very accurate detailed draftsman and some of the exercises can be challenging because of the detail rather than the actual technique. The book is well produced and a useful reference for the beginner and intermediate student."
3,One Subject Watercolor Book,"Northlight books is always trying to find new angles on watercolor and this one was not a winner for me.I have purchased many art books Northlight has published over the years. Most of the watercolor books cover watercolor wash techniques. Such books include Paul Jackson's Painting Spectacular Light Effects in Watercolor and Tom Hill's The Watercolorist's Complete Guide to Color.After purchasing this book and reading it from cover to cover I was not impressed. Garcia covers watercolor washes in his Watercolor Bible book, which I think is a better book for the money.It is also interesting to note that this book is out of print, but the Watercolor Bible is still being published. Plus with the Watercolor Bible you get much more."
3,I expecteded more from the Berg Quartett --- 3 1/2 stars,"This is by no means a bad performance, and I do not intend it as a bad review. The 3 1/2 stars is a relative rating, taking into consideration the other excellent recordings the Berg Quartett has produced. Judged on its own merits, this would be in the top ten versions of the Schubert Quintet I have heard.The problem is that I have been spoiled by the Bergs' top-notch recordings of the Beethoven Quartets. I have also heard live performances of the Schubert Quintet which far exceed the level of playing heard on this CD. I guess I came to this CD with expectations that were too high, but I cannot help but be influenced by the Berg Quartett's high standards of musicianship, and this recording left me feeling somewhat disappointed. Again, this is not a bad performance, but I would recommend the Emerson Quartet's version before I would recommend this one."
5,AS advertised,"Be sure to allow a few days with the gun in the holster for a perfect 'fit'... at first I could not snap the holster shut... but after a few days and working it in and out and snapping by force, it now snaps perfectly... great product... great quality and fit."
3,Calculus Mysteries and Thrillers,"While this book is useful to see how one can apply Calculus to everyday life, the solutions were sometimes more complicated than the problem itself. This book is definately not for the novice calculus student. The book uses many formulas that you may not find in a Calculus textbook and it just assumes that you know them. At times, I found it difficult to understand simply because it doesn't explain the problems as thoroughly as I would have liked it to."
3,Meh,"The story started off okay, but the action was never taken to the level it should have been on. For the number of casualties, there was hardly any depiction of actual wounds. The space combat was great, for as long as it lasted between ships."
2,The reflective stripes ruined it,"The vest is made of decent quality cloth. It feels sturdy. Vest has lots of pockets -- front bottom, top, and inside. Zippered front. Is not ANSI certified.Two things ruined it for me: the stripes and the ""concerned for safety"" labels. The reflective stripes look bizarre. They are made up of a yellow cloth with some type of plastic nonsense in the middle. They are practically worthless for high-visibility, night-time operations. Wearing these on the side of a moderately-lit road will get someone in trouble.Second, the safety labels. Yes, they can be cut off -- but they just look so tacky and homemade that they ruined the overall effect of the vest for me.Would not recommend. Would not buy again. Will not use unless my other five vests are completely shredded and unable to be worn."
4,Surveyors Vest,"It's a good vest, would have liked vest measurement before ordering instead of arbitrary sizes."
2,Too high level and biased,"I have never disliked a technical book more than this one. The table of contents looks great - lots of coverage of everything having to do with XML. The content though, is very disappointing. For the most part, every topic is covered at a very high level and the author's biases are very generously woven throughout. I found several cases of overstatements and omissions of accurate information. (Perhaps it is already out of date?)This book might be good for someone trying to get a high level view of all that XML is capable of infiltrating. For anyone that wants any real technical content, this will be a big disappointment."
5,"Superb Singer, Superb Entertainer!","A truly great singer who had a superb vocal range and extra ordinary breath control. Mel could really play to an audience and always (as on this cd) provided a wide range of material which included a variety of moods and tempos. Also he was a pretty good drummer as demonstrated on ""Rockin' In Rhythm"". I haven't heard anyone who could segue from one song to another as facilely as Mel (""Ridin' High"" into ""I'm Shootin' High"").....or with as much humor (""I'll Remember April/I Concentrate On You""). I've never heard him fail to give credit to the accompanying musicians and he always keeps the audience informed of the music(listen to his intro on ""I'm GonnaGo Fishin'"").If you dig a great vocalist.....and one who can scat with the best, this is a must!"
4,vintage Torme,"This is a very classy CD. Very smooth and listenable. Put this on along with other Torme CDs or some Julie London, Sarah Vaughn, maybe June Christie and pour yourself a double (Glenlivit or Crown Royal is my choice) , sit back in you favorite chair and let the music take you away."
2,Poison Arrow,"I honestly didn't like the DVD. I am a big fan of the band, but it was like watching PBS do a special on HIM. It was almost as if it was a student made film. It was slow moving, had interviews with a lot of people who didn't seem all there, not to mention their PR person was totally wasted the entire time she was talking. Way to represent the band."
4,Enjoyable viewing!!!,"Poison Arrow is a great DVD full of clips of HIM and Ville, live footage and photos. Those that work with the band reveal the stories, and also Ville's dad is interviewed. At the end there is a fantastic section with a quiz about the band, for those that are new to HIM and their music this is a fantastic film to get the low down on where they came from and what they're about!"
2,HIM - POISON ARROW DVD,"NOT AUTHORIZED BY HIM. NOT OFFICIAL MERCHANDISE. ADD THIS DVD ONLY IF YOU ARE A HIM COLLECTOR. CONTAINS CLIP ART, COPIED INTERVIEWS - NO LIVE MUSIC...IN FACT NO MUSIC AT ALL!!!"
4,Excellent DVD about my favorite band - Love Ville Vallo!!!!!,"I really enjoyed this DVD. Ville Valo rocks & HIM are brilliant!!!! There were long interviews with his dad - which showing what Ville was like from an early age. It has loads of interviews with people that know the band - including a lady that helped break them. There could have been more photos of Ville, but I did have fun doing the quiz!"
5,All Hail The Power,"All Hail The Power!! I believe this song should have been the title track. All Hail the Power is a powerful hymn that The Anointed Voices just sang out of their hearts on. Our choir ""Tehillah"" had to take a chance and sing this song also, it send you straight into praise and worship mode.It's definitely a church choir song and the whole CD is great it blessed my soul."
3,Flimsy,This tea ball is made of very thin metal and doesn't want to close properly. It popped open in my hot water the first use. Go for something of better construction.
1,Outrageous,"This is an outrageous price for such a small, insignificant piece of glass. I do hot glass and I'd charge about $15 for that."
4,I wouldn't have bought it.....,If I knew it was going to be such a pain ... to put together! The steps were SUPER easy BUT little but VERY important things didn't seem to line up quite right AND I had to GUESS on where three of the screws were supposed to go because there was NO guide hole!! If it all holds up well than I will LOVE it but otherwise I would say don't buy it!
1,Defective,"After toting all the pieces up stairs, all excited to put it together, my 2 year old daughter was even helping. Get to step 1 where you slide the first 3 pieces together and holes are missing for the pegs to go into. Holes were missing just on one side, isn't that what quality check if for?? We will return this for the same bed and hopefully get a FUNCTIONAL bed."
4,great idea for a bed,my wife and i think this is the greatest idea for a lil girls bed.our daughter will love to get this for christmas.
3,Will shrink,"These socks are great the first couple wears, but then they shrink and the layers of fabric get bunchy. They're not something that will last you a whole year of running."
2,shrinks,"These socks are great to prevent blisters. However, they appear to shrink with repeated washings in a short period of time"
4,Good basic Shock,"Got these for the front of my '99 Ford Ranger. Installation was easy. They ride fine and fixed the wheel hop that was occurring with the worn-out OEM shocks. I didn't need anything special and did not want to spend a lot of money since I will probably sell the truck next year. I was very surprised to see Amazon selling auto parts, but could not resist the good price with no tax and no shipping."
4,50/50,"NFS Underground is a fun continuation of the Need For Speed series. The graphics are pretty good and the atmosphere of the whole game in general is pretty neat.The customization of your vehicle is possibly one of the best features of the game. There are infinite combinations of colors, paints and other stuff that will truly make your car unique.Unfortunately, the Single-Player mode of the game does get slightly boring. The settings of the races are always in the same place and you have the impression you're always doing the same race track (which is basically what you are!). Also, the AI is so-so at best and there are some levels in the game that get really boring (7 laps!!!!)In short, it's a fun game but be prepared to get bored after a while of playing!"
3,A solid arcade game,"Those who expect realistic physics model and distinctive performance characteristics for different cars will be disappointed.-No damage model, none whatsoever! Even bumpers don't fall off after impact.-All cars handle the same-Force feedback steering is not precise and responsive (this is after playing F1 2002 and Colin McRae 3)On the other hand the graphics is very pretty. If you are the fan of The Fast and The Furious movies, you'll love this game.I'm a hard-core simulation gamer, so I got bored pretty fast because theirs no learning curve. You cannot hone your skills, you are pretty good from very beginning and your victories pretty much depend on luck."
3,Needs Better Cars For Speed,"The game and graphics were pretty darn good but they need a better choice of cars. This game would have gotton 5 stars if I could drive a 1969 Hemi'cuda, or any other good car (cars made from real metal, hence, made in the '60's). But over all worth $18.00."
1,"so disappointing!! worst racing game, ever!!","Apart from graphics and sound, this game is nothing. Why? First of all, as for a racing game, the control is so NOT real!! The cars handle like toys. Next, the game is the least close racing game of EA, ever! Computer players cheat all the time. God knows how they change lanes that fast and cut corners without slowing down! Last and the dumbest, some traffic is made for blocking your car only, believe me!!I suggest EA either fire your current AI programmers or hire them some psychiatrists.For those who still wanna buy this game after reading my comments, good luck!"
3,Not bad,"For $0.98 how can I complain? This game is pretty fun, but don't buy it if fake ghetto makes you want to punch in your computer screen."
4,Drive Fast!!,"This is a fun game, very structured in the races you get to drive on, 111 races drive as fast as possible and beat the game!!"
1,Stupid,If you like to fool around with boring games this is for you. The game sucks. It has horrible graphics and it is too hard to drive the slow goofy looking cars. It is a horrible game and it is not worth a penny.
1,This isn't for a game system!,"This product is made to be played on a computer!I bought it, thinking my godson could play it in his Play Station II. He can't. He tried it in his computer, but at age 9 and with minimal computer skills, he's dissappointed.Moral of this story: check really, really carefully when you buy these kinds of games. I'm a little older & wiser."
3,"I miss the daylight, but it's still a fun ride.","I'm only slowly warming up to the whole idea of decorating one's car to earn ""style points"" and that sort of thing. I enjoy the drag-racing mode more than I'd imagined I ever would. I enjoy the game in spite of the whole illegal, after-hours aspect of it, with all the questionable characters hanging around and distracting me. I guess the one thing I'd say it's missing is a daytime mode, which could have been included via a cheat code or some such."
3,Not that good.,"I've done tons of racing games, and this one just didn't meet the high mark of its predecessors. I played the original Need For Speeds, including Hot Pursuit, but one feels like an afterthought to the original Need For Speed games.In short, I stopped playing it. I tried several times to get into it, but the gameplay was ever so slightly different from the first installments, and, for whatever reason, it didn't hold my attention.On the plus side, I recognize the actress they used for one of the CGI characters that you see at the beginning of each race. Neat. Who knew she did games?I don't know, there's better racing games out there. This one is oriented towards achievements, making unlocking tracks a bit of a chore. That, and the tracks themselves, as detailed as they are, aren't that inspired.If you absolutely need a new racing game, then I'd recommend either the earlier versions of the title, or the Trackmania series over this particular installment.Just my two bits."
3,For older players,"I think Need For Speed Underground might be a fun game for older players. My 8 year old enjoyed the game, but was constantly frustrated at only being able to race on one or two tracks because he couldn't ever win enough games to unlock the next level. I would definitely not recommend this game for younger players."
2,Flash crap for kids,"I agree with the review from Valter from brazil I can't beleive anyone but a child would think this game is good. NFS porsche unleashed is a great game and I bought this and the previous release hoping for an improvement on that game but ea. games has totally lost the point of what was a great series.I gave it 2 stars because the obvious target audience will love this nonsense, otherwise 1 star is more suitable."
3,Demo Has Serious Flaws - Beware!,"I have played the demo extensively which was just released a short time ago. Being that it is so close to the full version release, it has me concerned that the flaws will not be fixed.In circuit mode, the handling is no where near previous NFS products. When you crash, no damage; just a message saying ""totalled"". Controls including accerlator & steering respond sluggishly. It does not have higher resolutions for those who have the hardware to run it. In the rest of the drag world, if you cross the finish first on your roof or not, you are the winner; not here.Despite the flaws, NOS'ing through gears in drag mode is incredible! The world around you starts to streak with colours & the speedometer climbs. Weave around cars, construction barriers & jump a train at 180MPH to finish first in 25.17 seconds. Definately cool.Jason"
1,dont think this is the right part,i wanna buy this but my transmission dont have the forks on 2 diff rods all 3 r on one rod please comment back so i can buy it
5,Invaluable musical document !,"This recital was widely commented in that year. Those performances are vivid and magisterial. This admirable duo gave a tour de force performance, with a first - rate program.This document is part of the recent musical memory."
2,Not For the Detail Oriented!,"Touring In Wine Country: Tuscany provides a richly illustrated overview for anyone considering a tour of the towns and vineyards of Tuscany. It is disappointing, however, in its lack of detail. It would be easier to navigate your way by following the author's narrative than by attempting to read the maps, which are almost completely useless. There are recommendations for shopping and restaurants, but this information also is quite condensed, written in small pale type, and rather vague as to price range.A far more useful book is A Traveller's Wine Guide To Italy, by Stephen Hobley."
4,"Objective, entertaining, if inot narrow in scope and flawed in areas","Among social science literature I try to detect bias -- this book obviously contains bias, but relative to other books in this category it is refreshingly objective and based on empiricism, fact, logic.For example, the authors expose environmental abuses, leftist attacks on 3rd world working conditions, while at the same time offer an empirical defense of abortion as a primary causal mechanism for the decades long reduction in crime.without offering my personal bias and logical objection to many of the assertions made by the authors, as i have done in other reviews, I will simply note that it is rare that an author attacks extremist environmentalism, defends ""sweat shops in china"" and defends abortion in the same book.I would recommend this book for any objective, independent thinking, and rational reader."
4,Economics 101,"This is a good book for those wanting a real world basic understanding of the economy. The author does a good job explaining how the world economy works in laymens terms and without graphs,charts etc. Concepts you may have not even really wondered about but after he explains them, a light bulb goes on and you say to yourself, ""Now I see"". I thought the book was a good read. Not boring or overly long. If your seeking to gain a basic understanding of the economy, it's a good place to start."
3,"Great for beginners, not for others","If you're looking for a book to introduce you to the wonderful world of economics, particularly microeconomics, and how it applies to everyday life, this isn't a bad bet. It is well written, easily digesible, and full of lucid examples. The one book I have read which should be higher on your list in ""Naked Economics"" which injects a lot more humor and is more ""fun"" to read.For those already familiar with economic thinking, this book isn't all that insighful in ways you haven't heard before.I would recommend ""Hidden Order"" which did a better job in that regard, as did ""Freakonomics"". Stephen Landsburg has a few interesting books as well.Depending on your economic background, this book will either be a fascinating read, or a bit ho-hum."
3,Econ 101 Deja Vu,"Not as incisive as all the reviewers seemed to think....that is all those folks in New York and Washington. A nice review of how principles of economics work out in the marketplace. A bit thin on decisions made by individuals. Still, a useful primer for the person who never thought about economics before."
3,An Insightful book with one too many flaws...,"First off, I would like to start by saying that I am an 18 year old college student studying Economics. For the last 2 years, I've read approximately 40 books on the subject of Economics. ""The Undercover Economist"" was one of my first reads. I finished the book in a few days, and was very impressed with the insight that was contained in it. I started noticing things in grocery stores (one of the most interesting parts of the book in my opinion) advertisements, pricing, etc.. It opened my mind to concepts which I had given no thought to prior to reading.The main problem I have with this book, is that the author typically presents how he himself would like to solve the problem currently being discussed (pollution, health care, etc). At first glance, his solutions make since, but when they sink in, and after you do some quick research, they fall apart completely.I liked the book, I really did, I just don't think it deserves the praise it's been given."
4,Traditional Economics with a dash of Freak,"This book is being compared a lot with Freakonomics and that's not really a fair comparison. This book is really about making traditional economics fun. The last couple of chapters is pure macroeconomics and almost reads like a textbook.The first 8 or so chapters is where the fun is at. But I take issue with a couple of his conclusions.While real estate is no doubt important to Starbucks, I'm not sure it's the primary reason why their drinks are so expensive. Rent does not make up that much of the cost of a single cappuccino to justify such a high cost."
3,"Good on the theory, Superficial on the big issues","The first half of the book provided elegant examples of basic economic principles. Most of the concepts would be familiar to anyone with a basic familiarity with economics, but it was well written and very engaging. The second half covers more complex topics: successes and failures of auctions, health care systems, the benefits of globalization and the growth of China. These are fascinating but complicated topics and, unfortunately, his coverage is very superficial. Although I think he is right in his conclusions, he dismisses differing opinions with an inadequate sentence or two. He should either have spent the time to develop and analyze the issues properly or should have stuck to more conceptual topics."
3,flawed,"Yes it is well-written. Yes it enlightens people ignorant re: economics like myself.Unfortunately, anyone who bothers to match up his premises and conclusions will find gaps - no matter how rational and convincing the writing seems. There is a strong and obvious bias, especially at the concluding sections of each chapter, which diminishes the value of almost anything he says. At least I know what the issues are now, but from his writing I can't depend on Harford for unbiased data."
2,Disappointing,"""The Undercover Economist"" is supposed to be a fun and accessible discussion of economics as it relates to social issues. Not so much. It is bad enough that the author tries too hard to be cute. Economics can be painfully dry but plenty of authors have found ways to make it fun. Harford's efforts to liven up what he has to say fall a bit flat.What I found more disappointing was Harford's approval for redistributive policies. While they always sound great in theory, such policies are always impossible to administer fairly or soundly and always generate more problems than they solve. ""Undercover"" would have been a stronger work had the author focused on fundamentals and left the more advanced topics out."
3,Pretty good book for non-econcomists,"The author deals with topics such as marginal costs, externalities, perfect markets etc. This is nothing new to persons who once in their life attended an economic class, so you most benefit from the book if you have no knowledge about economics. For the others, the examples are funny but my lecturer in university was unique in presenting real life examples, too.I would rather recommend ""Freakonomics""."
1,Very Very Basic,"If you have ever taken an economics class, this book is not for you. I contains about 3 pages of actual information and the rest is just fluff."
2,Not another Freakonomics,"Sorry, if you were looking for a folow-on read to Freakonomics, this is not it.If you are expecting more Freakonomics-like well researched and interesting insights, this book is sure to disappoint."
3,"Entertaining and readable, witty but forgetable","This is a quick read, entertaining, sometimes illuminating, but mostly a tool to kill a few hours. The reason for that is lack of depth; nevertheless it offers some insights worth thinking about. All in all good value for your time."
