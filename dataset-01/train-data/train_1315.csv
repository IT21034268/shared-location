3,An Entertaining Read,"Although not for people who are hard-core mystery fans who like overly subtle clues, many murders, and a constant search for the culprit, this book is still an entertaining read. My main problem with it was that there was no mystery, in a sense. Qwilleran didn't have to sit down and try to figure out who had done it. Everyone in the town knew who had done it. The only excitement about the murder itself was the criminal's attempts at fleeing."
3,Something mysterious is going on alright,"I have to agree with the review of Sue from Michigan who suggested the possibility of ghostwriting. I, too, have read the entire series. I was glad to see so many of the old characters and settings along with some new information about Qwill that I've long wondered about. Polly still knows her literary sources and Qwill is still frugal despite his millions, and yet something is wrong. All the pieces are there yet they don't quite make a whole puzzle. It is as though someone read the entire series and took notes. Why are there no recent photos or even author's notes on the jacket? The books have been very uneven in recent years--almost as though two people or more have taken turns writing them. I want someone to solve the mystery of the cat who series that seemed team written but only gave the best-selling author's name."
1,The Cat Who Should Retire,"I used to love the CAT WHO. But recently these books are long and boring. Qwill does absolutely nothing to solve the mystery-- the murderer's friend tells him the whole story. Qwill still does nothing. And in the obligatory confrontation with the murderer, Koko doesn't save the day (as he should). The characters are all done wrong as well. Qwill seems to find the commonfolk amusing. I refuse to believe LJB is still writing."
1,The Cat Who... books have lost the sparkle,"I have read the entire series of Cat Who books several times, and I find it difficult to believe this one was even written by Braun. The characters are wooden, the familiar details of Qwilleran's day-to-day life are missing, and the plot is nearly non-existent. What happened to all our favorite characters? I will not be pre-ordering the next book in the series. This one was too disappointing."
1,The last Cat Who book I will read,"I have been getting more and more disappointed in the Cat Who books and this is the nail on the coffin. Yes, it is better than the previous book, it does have somewhat of a mystery. Qwill is getting too Perfect and too Boring. And who would burn letters from their long dead mother without finish reading them. I will not be spenting any more money on Braun's books."
1,The Ghost must be real,"I've enjoyed the Cat Who series; I've read them all. Thank you, Ms. Braun, for so many fine stories. But this book could not have been written by you. At one point Qwill refers to a woman as a ""chick"" -- I just cannot belive that he would act this way unless a ghostwriter was at work."
2,A long drive to nowhere,"I have read and enjoyed almost every one of the cat who books and this was, by far, the least enjoyable. Reading this book was like going on a Sunday drive; passing nice scenery, and returning home. There was no excitement, no suspense, no amusement, just a pleasant excursion with little to show at the end.We gathered a glimpse into Qwill's past, but even that was cut short with no hope of ever hearing the end. The murdered suspect was just a cardboard cutout with some innuendos, but nothing substantial. The same with the murderers. There was absolutely no character development at all.Even the cats played a minor role.This book was like reading someone's journal of daily activities over a period of a week or so. Interesting, but certainly not worth the price of admission.Wait until this one comes out in paperback, or avoid it altogether."
2,I should have paid attention to the bad reviews,"I, too, have always been an avid ""Cat Who ... "" fan. However, this book fell well below expectations. Ms. Braun should seriously consider retiring Qwill, Koko, and Yum-Yum if, as it seems, she has run out of stories. Unfortunately, I think the rumors of ghostwriters must be true, because I don't want to believe that Ms. Braun has lost her touch. However, this will be my last ""Cat Who."""
4,Another Good One,"I liked the book and I don't know what other reviewers mean when they say that there isn't enough mystery solving by the cat. Come-on already, people commit murders and people solve them. The cats make the people interesting and help point the way, but it's the work of ""Qwill"" I am most interested in."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I've read all of ""The Cat Who..."" books and found this one to be most disappointing. I couldn't believe the end. It's just like the final chapter was missing. You knew all along ""who done it"" and why. Where were the twists and turns? I think Lillian Jackson Braun has run out of gas in this series."
3,The Cats Are Back,"""The Cat Who Robbed A Bank,"" the 23rd ""Cat Who book was interesting but not as well written as most of the others in the series. Last year's installment, ""The Cat Who Sang for the Birds,"" was a total disappointment. I always look forward to the new year and a new cat book. This year was no exception.Although the who in the who done it was no real mystery Qwill finds more about his past when some revealing letters written by his late mother to a friend gives Qwill an insight in to who his father was. (Qwill's father passed away before he was born.)The usual clues uncovered by the cats are here. The delightful town's people return too. This writer suggests you check out the older ""Cat Who"" books, and read them in sequence. If you read this one first I am afraid you will be turned off from the others. Perhaps book #24, if there is a book #24 will be better."
2,This Cat Who is Disappointing,"In this book we do learn a little history on Qwill's life, but not enough to stimulate interest. Also, I find that very little action on the part of Koko and Yum Yum is disappointing. I have always looked forward to that interaction between man and animal fasinating. Nice book, but lasks pizzaze!"
5,"Every ""Cat Who...."" is a pleasure!","I was so happy to see George Guidall return as the reader of Jackson's ""Cat Who..."" series. If you are an avid fan, try the un-abridged editions, they are wonderful and entertaining. Right now the only place I can find them (un-abridged)is the local library, and there is always a long waiting list, but worth the wait. Please continue with George Guidall, he IS Qwill."
2,The cat who earned two stars,"What a page turner! I kept turning the pages looking for a story! This book is so bland that Mrs. Braun put an overabundance of exclamation points to suggest action where none existed! It seems as if her heart was not in this installment. There was too much ""filler fluff"" and not enough theories about the murder and who might have ""dunnit."" Even Qwill was lazy this time figuring the murder will be solved at the end of the book so why bother with it? I hope this was just a bad outing for Mrs. Braun and not a steady decline."
2,The author who robbed her fans,"I'm an eternal L.J. Braun/Cat Who fan, but was very disappointed in this latest effort. The details behind the restoration of the the new Inn, Qwill's parental heritage, the Scottish games, the mechanical banks and auction were all fun, interesting and vintage Braun. However, considering that this book is categorized as a ""murder mystery"", the murder was boring, and there really wasn't much mystery! Already being a fan, I still enjoyed parts of the book, but if you're not yet a fan, don't start with this book!"
3,"OK book, but no plot.","I got this book expecting an interesting mystery. This is definitely not what I got --A murder is committed around page 50, after that, the main character, Qwilleran, keeps living his life like nothing happened until, around page 200 he finds out who the murderer is and keeps living his life. Practically no plot, no investigation, no nothing...Even so, the book is an interesting (and fast - 3 hours at most) read. If you like cats, read The Cat Who... books, if you want real mystery, stick to Agatha Christie."
3,The Cat Who Didn't Do Anything,"This is the second Cat book on tape I've listened to, and I did not enjoy it as much as the first one. Qwill didn't seem to actually do anything; things just happened around him. What a pleasant fellow he seems...maybe he's started prozac."
2,Shallow and stupid,"Wow, was this book ever dumb. The characters are all stupid, some more so than others. The protagonists, while naive and shallow, are the least stupid so they get to 'outsmart' the bad guys...I think. I couldn't finish the book, but that's the way it was headed. The narrative is extremely flat and predictable without much descriptive detail. Honestly, it reminds me of a freshman writing project more than a spy 'thriller'. I hope to god the real spies are smarter than this book describes, or we're all doomed!"
2,misleading title,"This collection would be better titled ""The Anti-Christmas Book."" It was obviously compiled by Ebenezer Scrooge BEFORE the Spirits visited!"
2,With all the rave reviews..,You see all the reviews having 5 stars out of 5 stars--I couldn't bring myself to agree. This book starts being really quite good--it drew me in--but then it started to dddddddrrrrrraaaaaaaaggggggggg. I put it down for a while and tried again (I did this 3 times) when I decided to give it up for good. I think it could have been better. :(
4,aaaa,I have always had good luck with monroe and these were no different. They do their job what else can be said.
1,Does not fit 2000 Chevy Metro,I ordered this as a direct fit for my 2000 Chevy Metro. It does not meet up with the OEM flanges. I called andd emailed Walker and got no response.
3,A confusing title,"Despite its title, this is not a basic text introducing the key KM theories and concepts. Fuller attempts to place knowledge management on a 'secure intellectual footing' by tracing the historical, philosophical, and sociological underpinnings of KM. While it may offer an alternative view to the hype that abounds in the KM literature, it is a heavily theoretical text and there is very little in it for the practitioner."
2,Doesn't live up to the title,"First of all I must say that I haven't really finished the whole book yet, and that's a symptom of the problem. I find the book, albeit the topic, quite boring. I agree with another review that the author tone is lectural and there are many fillers in each chapter. I haven't found anything new in this book either. This book might be okay if you are looking for one that has a broad coverage, but there's nothing new."
5,What Every Man Should Know,"Women are mysterious, or at least I always thought they were, but a soft, romantic light is shed on this mystery of feminine sexuality by Lou Paget's engaging, readable book. She covers everything from foot massage to massage of, well, more intimate body parts. But the proof will be with your partner, and mine says, ""every woman should give this book to her lover."" But smart men will buy it for themselves and just surprise her with all they know about what REALLY turns her on."
3,"Maybe a dozen useful principles--borrow, don't buy","This book is supposedly for guys, but its packaging and tone are a better fit for women. I read it cover to cover, and while Lou Paget nails the fundamentals down (take your time, make sure you respect her as much as you desire her, use all of your (and her) body parts, foreplay is the main course not the appetizer, use protection and know each other's background and expectations, vary your approach, be attentive to her signals)...I just don't see most men taking this book, with its pamper-the-woman focus and titillating anecdotes, seriously enough to acquire the useful tidbits within.In dwelling on tenderness and relaxation the author neglects to honor the potential appeal of male aggression in sexual encounters. She fails to stress the importance of communicating to the woman what the man wants and prefers."
3,Absolute Pleasure,"Moderately helpful for folks who may be just beginning their readings in this area, but mostly on a basic and somewhat surface level. Needs more detailed content and an expanded discussion of the emotional needs of both persons in a relationship.Apparently the author has no professional training in the area, and has simply re-packaged what she's been told by professionals she's interviewed, or has read elsewhere."
2,Waste of time,Nothing explicit!!! Very basic information and not complete. Only opinions of people. I didn't finished to read it.
2,A Major Disappointment,"I found this book very, very elementary and vague. Most of the chapters contain general information that have nothing to do with pleasing a woman. The rest of the book is about as useful as your typical men's magazine. I read this book from cover to cover in about 2 hours and it was certainly a waste of time and money."
2,Very stereotyped view of human relations.,"What has disappointed me about this book is that the ""tips to get her in the mood"" she gave in chapter three are the cliches of a third class Hollywood movie. This kind of simple psychological presentation of such physiologically complex creatures is very inaccurate and degrading. What is ironic is that for the rest of the book she is trying to convince the reader that for each woman there is a different procedure to (similar to fingerprint) give her an orgasm.As a reader I am disappointed that she is over generalizing such beautiful creatures with stereotypes out of a paperback romance novel."
4,Good compilation,I think most people who are looking to buy a book such as this for themselves are probably curious enough to have aquired most of the information contained in the book. Although I do feel the author does a good job of compiling a lot of information. Would probably make a good gift for someone who is not that clueful.
3,Not particularly well-written,"A lot of enthusiasm, but scant on details. And a bit too formulaic. Most important fact from the book: don't blow in their ears!"
4,Very good,"We read this together. The advice was explicit and excellent.It provided tips on creating the ideal romantic atmosphere, helped me find her elusive hot zones and althou I thought I knew foreplay, the author provided the down-and-dirty details on the ins and outs of the most amazing oral and manual sex we ever had. It showed innovative intercourse positions ( which we then tried) and most important, how to capture the big O andcum."
3,"Get it from experience, not a book","Useful but not earth shattering stuff. I bought this book when i was relatively inexperienced and found that once I got going, this stuff just came to me and I left my ladies...well...happy. Don't buy this book. Go out, meet a girl and try things out. It's in you....practice brings it out"
4,Pay Attention Dummy !,"This book is exactly correct, unfortunately or fortunately I was looking to tweak my lovemaking prowess but the main thing that I found was that I have always done it from cover to cover exactly right! This book stresses the importance of how you treat a woman as the starting point of making love down to the parting kiss and final caress of each session, the author has left nothing out. The conents of this book, if followed to the letter will make a man a very powerful lover and totally satisfy any woman. I speak from experience."
3,Sets the stage,"This book really helps a man set the stage for lovemaking. The book is a little short on actual technique but one of her main arguments is that if you prepare a woman properly then your technique is secondary.There are lots of little things in this book that almost every man is going to overlook and yes they do ""work"" when you actually do them. She could, however, have spent more time on ""atypical"" women who may be more into technique than mood sometimes (yes such women do exist despite what Lou believes)."
3,what most men know but are to lazy to do,"I was pretty disappointed with the content of this book. It contained material that most men I am sure they know but are just plain too lazy to do. If men do not know how to give a woman a massage, that kissing and touching are key, or that being a gentleman doesn't help a lady to be swayed, he is a real .... Maybe I have been out of pocket for a long time, but if men don't know 95% of the material in this book, no wonder women are up in arms. I am by no means Studly McStudly, but Jesus Christ, are the men in the world actually that stupid when it comes to trying to please a woman?The chapters on STD's was a mind opening chapter and was the one thing I found to be significant. If for no other reason every man and woman should read this chapter. The chapter on sex toys I found to be quite humorous, especially the one that some vibrators are on the same frequency as a garage door opener."
2,Great cars at rip off prices,"These are great little toys, and my three year old is obsessed with them! He's getting most of them for Christmas, but we've already bought him a few. They're die cast, so they are a good weight, but note that some of them have plastic pieces as well.Even though I like these toys, I'm only giving them two stars. This is a horrible price!! I honestly bought Sally today at my local K-Mart, and it was on sale for $2.89 (normally $3.19). Now I know when items are scarce and in high demand their price goes up, but this is a crazy markup. I understand that this is a third party seller, but Amazon should note with their sellers that there is a difference between mark up for high demand toys and rip offs. I have purchased Chick Hicks ($9.50) and Lizzie ($5.00) off of eBay, but I've been able to find the rest of the cars at my local Targets, Wal-Marts, K-Marts, etc. It takes time and searching, but it beats paying these prices!"
2,Sally,"My daughter loves the car!!!! She plays with it all the time. However, I wish I would have known that they are sold for $4 in stores. I would have never bought it."
2,A rather mechanical account of PRB culture.,"Aimed at a general readership, this must be the most recent book on the Pre-Raphaelites. Where most writers have been happy to repeat the standard conventions about the PRB and their paintings, Barringer wants to tell us that issues seep into their brilliantly-lit compositions. Alas for the reader, in avoiding the pictorial complexity and brilliance of PRB painting, Barringer devotes far too much space to fashionable academic jargon on such subjects as colonialism, gender, class and so on. Instead of ceaseless curiosity in the face of these remarkable paintings, Barringer provides us with a series of judgemental cliches about modernity and ideology. Why, the reader is left to ponder, is he embarrassed by PRB paintings? Why the fixation with 'theory'? What is 'wrong' with these paintings?!"
2,disppointing,"The previous reviewer is, alas, right. A depressingly judgememntal book, far more interested in righteous pronouncement on predictable topics than in the exploration of art works far more complex than this author is willing to allow. The Pre-Raphaelites need new literature. Much of the writing now extant is stale and repetitive, but this is not the way forward. Look at the paintings, Dr Barringer - don't simply 'read' them for coded messages."
3,Not good for climbers,This table is cute and has strong chairs that even I (148 pounds) I can sit in. My only problem is my daugther loves to climb in the middle storage bins and try and sit in it so I can not leave her unsupervised until she learns that this is not what is used for.
1,amazon was horrible to me as a buyer...,"i bought this item ""cinderella table and chairs"" for my daughters birthday. she really wanted this. i got the 1st one and it was damaged, then a second one it was also damaged, then a third one it was missing part ""E"" and amazon would not replace the missing seat part ""E"" instead the wanted me to return this item for a refund after my daughter recieved the table and 1 chair for her birthday this issue has not yet been resolved. i couldn't break my daughters heart after all it was the only thing she asked for this year. i will not buy from amazon till i get my part ""E"".disapointedly yours,samantha miller"
2,Wrong Surmises,"Though the book raises interesting questions, its conclusion is wrong. DeSalvo was the killer for these reasons: 1) the unique knots tied around the victims were the same knots DeSalvo used on his handicapped child 2) DeSalvo's employment records prove he had the time to commit all 11 murders and 3) contrary to the supposed lack of physical evidence, soot was found near one victim. DeSalvo's employment records prove he was in contact with engine soot that very day. Given the above, DeSalvo's criminal record, and his confession, DeSalvo is a sure bet."
3,Half a job,".She does a pretty good job establishing the person associated with the Boston Strangler killings, Albert DeSalvo, didn't do them. His confessions had quite a few factual errors. In fact, he was never charged with the crimes.The back cover blares ""Now The Real Killers Are Exposed."" Well, not really. The author puts forth a few possibles.More importantly, the book never addresses why law enforcement dropped the case. This despite the numerous officers and officials the author quoted who said they always knew DeSalvo had nothing to do with the Strangler murders."
3,Interesting review of the case....,"I, for one, was one of those who thought Albert DeSalvo was guilty. I reached this conclusion after watching the movie many years ago and reading Gerold Frank's book. Over the years, I had heard that Albert may not have been guilty after all. After reading this book, I am convinced that Albert never was the actual Boston Strangler.Kelly lays out the proof from court transcripts and interviews many of the detectives that originally investigated the case. The evidence she presents is quite convincing that others had firm motives for being the Boston Strangler.The only bad part of the book, which almost caused me to give up reading it, was Kelly's over-reliance on court transcripts. In some chapters, she goes on and on with quoted court transcripts that become boring to read really quickly! The book would have been much better if she had summarized the proceedings instead on relying on court transcipts."
3,"Excellent research, good writing, but difficult presentation","This book is obviously extremely well researched, and the narrative is easy to read, but only 100 pages into it I am finding it necessary to make my own lists, timelines, and charts to keep track of the players and events. She failed to provide any, even though she introduces multiple threads. She discusses at least three sets of victims (DeSalvo's, Nassar's, and the Boston Stranglers'); several players at several levels of police, judicial, and political jurisdictions; several attorneys, and several different political factors, including cross-jurisdictional squabbles and who gets what kind of publicity. Nevertheless, the reader is given no tie-backs to help keep all of those straight, including which names belong to which set of victims or law enforcement agency, even though 50 pages and multiple other players frequently separate references to specific individuals or significant factors."
4,Spacious bag for my Nikon CoolPix 5700,"The Lowepro Rezo 110 AW seems to be the perfect ""All Weather"" camera case for my Nikon CoolPix 5700. Since I live in NW Oregon we do get some rain, and that's saying it mildly. I'm very happy about the size and convenience of use of the case. I would not hesitate to recommend Lowepro products to anyone looking a durable and well designed case."
2,Too Small!!!!,"I was surprised when I received this to find it so tiny. Reviewers recommended it for the Canon sx20is. I however cannot do the same. It has the Lowepro excellent build quality but it is so tiny that I almost felt claustrophobic trying to get anything in and out of it. The small form factor would not be such a big deal, but every zipper, pocket etc. is so tight and hard to get into. I am a small woman...5'1"" with small hands. I could not imagine my husband who is 6'2"" and a big guy ever being able to use this. It certainly would be a great bag for those tiny cameras that fit in the palm of your hand, but then again you've got to be able to get into it! I have other Lowepro bags and this one is making a quick return to Amazon.I would highly recommend the Lowerpo Slingshot 100aw. It's the perfect bag for this cam."
4,Perfect Bag,This bag is perfect for my new Nikon 1 V1 with additional lens. It provides protection without unnecessary bulk. I can include all of the usual accessories and still feel encouraged to take it with me on a regular outing. Well done Lowepro.
5,Another Lowepro Great...,"Love the Rezo series. Have several of them for our business. Well made, water resistant, love the All Weather Cover. My wife assists me sometimes on a shoot. She uses a Nikon D90 and 18-200 VRII or 85/mm/1.8. Plenty of room, holds cards and an extra battery. Perfect for her petite size. Nice padding for protection. Hard to beat Lowepro, just need to see the interior measurements before ordering to make sure your cam/lens will fit. Those who complain it doesn't fit probably didn't follow the old adage, ""Measure once..ooops; Measure twice, order once."" A+ as will most all Lowepro engineered/designed solutions. This bag is meant for quick portability in smaller format cam/lenses. Great Amazon price and delivery. Highly recommended...if you measure first."
4,"Perfect for SX-40HS, packaging needs slight improvement","I bought this specifically for the SX40HS based on other reviews of this bag.This bag comfortably holds the SX40HS, an extra battery, charger, USB cable and card reader. I think it provides better protection for the camera than some of the ""fitted"" products do.The value is good, and is better than paying retail price.I would have given this 5 stars, but the packaging could be improved a bit. The shipping box tightly fits the bag, so when I opened it, I almost cut the bag.If the box were a bit bigger, or if there were a piece of corrugated or crumpled paper placed on top of the bag before sealing the box, the potential for cutting the bag when opening the box would be eliminated."
1,Don't be deceived!,I ordered this to try and save some money since my Honda dealer wanted $35 for this item.Well these folks sell you this for $4.95 and charge $12.99 for shipping plus tax and don't tell you that there is no hardware included to put the bracket on your car! Cost for the hardware at my local Honda dealer: $27.95.This is a rip off!
4,Good Buy,Inexpensive and perfect for labeling my 48 bottle wine rack. No more shuffling bottles to find the wine what I want.
3,Silly Fun w/ Action peppered in!,"""Desert Punk"" is a great way to spend a couple hours, it's a ""post-apocalyptic sex comedy/action adventure"" is how I would describe it. It follows a mercenary named Desert Punk (of course) and the trials and tribulations he faces as a soldier for hire. He is accompanied and visited often by a barrage of fun characters with outrageous personalities during his adventures. He has an obsession with breasts, and one character in particular is VERY well endowed. The violence is somewhat mild and often bloodless, what makes it un-suitable for the younger viewers is the excessive sexual content (not nudity) of Desert Punk's fantasies. This anime doesn't take itself too seriously, so if your looking for a great plot you should propably look elsewhere. Still it's entertaining and often very amusing to see the situations the hero gets himself into."
5,above by pillar,Their music is different and with a good measage backed up with awsome instormentals. All songs have realy good intos. They are my favorite
5,Five Stars Isn't Enough!!,"These guys SO rock. I first saw an article on these guys in Newsweek and was intrigued. Then I went to the Newsweek website and heard a small sample of their music and WOW, I was so hooked. I immediately bought the Above CD and it will always be one of my favorites. Finally, fantastic music with a good message."
5,It Worked For Me,It Worked For Me. I needed to expand the RAM on my laptop and this fit my model and did the trick. It's still working. Never had a problem.
5,Memory Upgrade review,The item arrived in a timely manner. It fit the computer and is working great.
1,Did not work in Sony PCG-FX205K laptop,This did not work in Sony PCG-FX205K laptop which would not boot up with the memory installed.
1,Bait and switch fraud,"I originally ordered a 40GB hard drive for my Dell C600 laptop (as advertised by Link - Tronics Memory, but what I got was a bait and switch, Link - Tronics Memory, sent me this over-priced memory chip instead."
1,Greatest 60s Megamix [IMPORT],"The CD sent me [imported; UnOriginal(!)Artists] had broken/OR/nonexistant track-selectability, and was returned for refund."
5,Quality,"This cd is all quality.some of the best songs by a blues rock artist around.This cd is more on the rock side.I would call it a rock cd.You cant go wrong if you like 70's style music.Craig Erickson is one of the most under rated/unknown superstars of the blues rock world.I simply love his playing,oustanding musicmanship,great vox all add up to a winner here.If you liked any of his earlier releases then you have to pick up this one too.The last song a cover of Stratus[rock fusion BillyCobham 70's masterpice]tears up the guitar like no ones business.Props on that one because it aint easy walkin in Tommy Bolins shoes covering that song."
2,"nice product, but the edges came broke.","Unfortunally I can't use the product! came the ends broke, that hard plastic is delicate so the edges(ends)came broke(covercase), maybe should came wrapped better into the box :-(Sorry!"
2,CRSTAL CASE,MY DAUGHTER IS 8 AND MY SON IS 10. THOSE CASES WERE SOOO CHEAPLY MADE! THEY BROKE WITHIN 2 WKS! I DID GET WHAT I PAID FOR.
1,Don't even think about it,"This case cracked just a couple days after I got it, and part of the hinge broke off on both sides. And you can't just take the clear hard case off and just use the silicone case, because the top and bottom of that are separate and won't stay on without the outer hard case. It's very hard to get on just right, and I broke it taking it off to readjust it, but I figured it was just my fault and I did something wrong so I ordered a new one. I should have just gone with ordering a plain silicone case. The hard plastic is nice while it lasts...which isn't long."
3,You Best Be Careful......,"Because this CD is NOT a Quincy Jones produced effort. The only thing it shares is the label and some of the guest artists. It is a disappointment in that Patti has a great voice -- however, it is mismatched with the same producer (Paul Brown) that worked with pop-jazz artists like Al Jarreau, Boney James, and Norman Brown -- and as a result, it spends waaay too much time trying to be ""radio friendly""! The fact that Boney James plays on one cut (uninspired, I might add) does not make it better.Overall, this disc is nowhere near the status or quality of a classic like ""The Real Me"" or her early ""Quincy produced"" Warner Bros. efforts. In fact, it attempts to ""contemporize"" her sound at the expense of mediocre material.I guess I expect too much from my Divas......."
4,A Nice Effort,"No one can fairly accuse the dynamic Patti Austin of selling out; plenty of singers have sacrificed thir talent and standards for an easy (and moronic) sting of hits they've been embarassed to later recall. Ms. Austin has instead sacrificed some commercial success for a bit of dignity, which is present throughout her excellent body of work over the past couple of decades. This album, which features the pedestian but classy production talent of Paul Brown, doesn't seem as special as other Patti Austin albums I've heard, but, to be fair, she'd have to produce a absolute masterpiece to overshadow her past albums (particurally ""That Secret Place,"" a personal favorite.) Overall, I'd suggest you buy this album, but she's definately made better recordings."
2,"By God, this CD is boring.","As a huge fan of Patti Austin I am quite dissapointed with this album. I admire Patti for creating such unique music with well written lyrics. Sadly this CD is her weakest album to date. It sounds as boring and lifeless as most of the forgettable elevator jazz and R&B. The songs are so similar that I can barely tell if I,m listening to the same song over and over again. I don't like rating albums by talented divas like Ms. Austin this unfavorably but this album was a major miss. Better luck next time Patti. Hopefully it will have a much different sound and more variety. There were a couple of goods songs on here which is why I give this an extra star. I do sometimes pop this CD into my CD player every now and then."
3,Maybe ON THE WAY... but never ARRIVING!!,"A FIVE-STAR singer like Patti deserves better than this. And so do her fans! All I can figure is that mid-life has addled her sensibilities, because this is one of the most mediocre group of songs assembled in a LONG time! Sure - she still sings like an angel - but the sentiments expressed (and repeated and repeated!) are more appropriate for a teeny-bopper, and the recorded sounds are anemic - trying to pander to the young crowd, maybe? Whatever it is, it DOESN'T GET THERE! Still - it IS Patti... so I can't give it just ONE star..."
1,On the way to nowhere!,"I have been a fan of Patti Austin for years now but what (...) is this? It stinks big time. It's nothing but forgettable elevator R&B Jazz that I really dislike. Another shock is the use of poor language in Playing Around. How could such an amazing diva sink to such a (...)state? I,m not necessarily turning my back in her this time but I am very dissapointed with this album. Hey, at least I have a coaster to use now. This one's worth passing up. Better luck next time Patti and make it more memorable please."
1,Must depend on your gutters,"Tried repeatedly to use these at my parent's house. Only once did we get the clip to actually click onto the gutter,and it stayed on only long enough to put the next clip on the pole. Totally useless for our purposes."
2,Works but be careful,"I used these with shingles instead of the gutter and they are holding up icicle led lights just fine.The problems are with the extension pole.To use the pole you must tighten each section to the next, otherwise you can't unscrew from the clip. Since the workmanship of the pole is suspect this isn't the easiest process. Also, when I was reaching the pinnacle of my roof and using some force, the product broke. I was able to complete the rest with an extension ladder borrowed from a neighbor.Bottom line, it is a nice idea but poorly executed."
2,Useless for Icicle lights,Tried to use this with icicle lights my wife bought. Nearly impossible to get the clip onto the string without pulling previous ones from the gutter. I imagine with mini lights these would work fine.
2,"Good for gutters, not so good for shingles on high pitched roofs","I read several reviews and got the swing of using these clips on the gutters. But when transitioned from my gutters to my shingles, I started to have trouble. The lower shingles weren't too hard. But I have a high pitched roof that requires a ladder AND the extension pole. When you get to the highest part of the roof, inserting the clips under the shingles is almost impossible. So, my review of this product is that it depends on your house. If you have mostly gutters or low shingles, this product works well. If you have a tall, high pitched roof like mine, I think you will give up after your lights fall off in your face a few times. My neighbors enjoyed watching my failed attempts."
4,"very stylish, but less functional then others","The watch looks great and keeps time well, but the hands are very small, making it hard to tell time in darker settings. Other then that, the watch is very nice!"
3,"FAIR BOOK, BUT NOT GREAT-","The first 2/3 of the book goes on about Henry Ford-the man- NOT the company. There is no true in-depth insight about the cars themselves. Then, the worst part of the book is in it's lightly skimmimg the waters of the postwar years. With the dramatic ideas of the Crestliner, the Victoria, the OHV V-8, the Lincoln Capri, the Skyliner glass-top, the Crown Victoria, the Skyliner Retractable hardtop, Lincoln Continental Mk. !!, the Edsel, the Falcon, the Mustang and Shelby Cobra; all are covered through very quickly, if at all, without the great details of the first 2/3rds of the book. At one point he succumbs to cutesy car songs, which completely let me down (he doesn't know his music any better than he does the '50s cars). The book was fairly good, but I was expecting SO MUCH better, especially on the postwar years."
1,A Disappointment,"I found no mention of Harry Ferguson, the Ford-Ferguson tractor(perhaps the most significant agricultural tractor of the Twentieth Century), or subsequent tractor work by Ford. There was no mention of Dearborn Motors, nor its significance to the Company."
3,"Interesting read, would improve without the sex scenes.","I hoped for a lively fictional dramatization of a difficult time in which Finns endured hardship, then won freedom; which I could share with my children.The premise that the stories were related GrandFather to GrandSon is good.The multiple sex scenes take this book from their young hands."
2,For the kids ...,"The writing isn't great. The story IS interesting. But this isn't literature. To be appreciated mostly by the younger teens. True story or fiction? Doesn't matter. If you've read anything about the Finns you'll already know that they're a tough and resourceful people. In this book they're nearly psychic. The russians cop an awful beating though, at times made to look almost sub-human. It's cheap. Buy it. But not if you're a russian.Interesting subcurrent is the obvious anti-russian sentiment. Considering the time this was written, maybe it was subconsciously also anti-soviet?"
4,Terrific Film,Godspeed was a terrific film! Moves at a slow pace but well worth the wait. Highly recommend this thriller!
4,Great Resource,".... The guides to the museums and the maps of the ancient sites are so helpful, especially in Greece, where things are not always marked in English. The pictures are beautiful, and make the book a wonderful souvenir of your journey. The historical explanations are clear, concise and interesting to read. The maps are excellent and accurate! My only complaint is that it doesn't give specific information about recreation places, like where the best places for swimming are. Also, it's coverage on hotels and restaurants was limited, but this was not a problem for us since it gave us all the information we needed to know. Overall, it is a great little book."
4,"Great visual treat, sparse on text","This book is a visual treat, but unfortunately doesn't have a wealth of information on hotels and restaurants and is woefully lacking history/archaeological information."
4,Great info about attractions,"This book has great information about attractions, with nice pictures and diagrams, as well as hours of operation and bus stop info. I really like it, but I also need another more comprehensive travel guide such as Rough Guide for detailed info on hotels and such."
3,For Athens and the Peloponnese maybe!,"I was expecting much more form this otherwise outstanding series. However, the goods end with Athens and the Peloponnese and very little research is done on the rest 2/3 of the country! So 3 stars for the piece. ""Northern Greece"" is exceptionally disappointing! Take a look at page 233 ""The name Macedonia derives from Makednoi, one of the tribes [what tribes?] who first inhabited the region in the late 4th century."" Later on... in reference to the Macedonian kings, it says: (p242) ""Philip II was from a long line of Macedonian kings that begun in about 640 BC with Perdiccas I."" Well... which one is it... late 4th century BC or early 6th BC?"" This edition is the negative to the success of the Greek Islands version. I hope a new one will clear up the shame!"
5,Native American style,"This book's multiplicity of characters, non-linear style, chrono-dispersion, emphasis on places, and group/communal dynamics all remind me of Native American literature, but with a modern conspiracy theorist's world view. The use of archetypical character names instead of standard names such as ""Singing Man,"" ""City Manager,"" ""Short Man,"" and the rest reminds me of many Native American works that use such devices to denote the spiritually dead. Interesting little literature diversion."
5,Spoke of the Hmong,"This prophetic book spoke out of the way we treated our allies in the Vietnam war, the Hmong, long before the tradgedy in St. Paul. This book is must to be reading!I do not find it is to be a liberal book at all. Early on character speak about a true free market. True conservatives should hold AKC dear. True conservatives should speak for freedom. Equal opportunity is America. Forgive is to be devine. ""The price of liberty is eternal vigilance,"" Say Barry Goldwater. God Bless America."
5,Shout it in the streets!,"Get off that computer and go to your local bookstore and DEMAND they stock this book. I just about tore my hair out when I got to the part about the little white darling secretly engaged in organized hate crime. Not my child, indeed! And they want us to believe that government agencies had nothing to do with LSD on soldiers and civilians... on drugs in the black community... with the denial of voting rights?The shady backroom deals... the trespasses on rights... the collusion of the press... the dirty tricks. How can you begin with all there is in this book? They take your land and give it to their buddies today just like they did with the Indians. Keep my brother broke. Devolve man, to the slugs... Yeah, I can dig it.I think they are all fighting to make America's Keenest City out of YOUR city."
3,Bizarre,"If you think that octopusses from space are in cahoots with the government and white supremacists to keep the black man down, then this is the book for you. If you think that big box stores are in cahoots with the government to close mom and pop businesses then take yourself to Canada or Cuba. If you think Calvinism is going to allow our intenstinal parasites to evolve into our masters after they cause us to be mean to the homeless for a million years-- well, what's the point? Good for a few laughs. This country is the land of opportunity. There was some trouble with racist, but we now have it under control. The poor are poor because of their own lack of initiative. Rush Limbaugh went from a poor family to be one of the most successful broadcasters in history. Big companies employ thousands of people and keep the economy going. That's the truth."
3,Leave the country then,There isn't any racism or poverty in this country and if you think it is so bad then leave the country!
3,GARY HOEY AMERICAN MADE,HEARD A SONG ON THE RADIO AND IT SOUNDED TO MUCH LIKE A JOE SATRIANA WANNABE. BUT AFTER LISTENING TO IT I NOTICED HE HAD HIS OWN STYLE.
3,"Interesting, but not one of the best","While it is a good album with new sound influence, it doesn't contain near the diversity and quality of some of Gary's earlier works. I will still continue to buy his future albums though, just to see what he comes up with next, and because I like the man's style."
5,Die Hard Indian style,Filled with lots of action . Aamir Khan is excellent in his part as a commando cop. Music was fun too. If you like Indian movies with lots of fight scenes this is the movie for you. Dvd worked well.
1,Once Fobidden,Extremely disappointed in this book - This is the 2nd in a series - The 1st one was great - This one was TERRIBLE!!! What a waste of my time and money
4,Whew ! Dark and sad,"This author is new for me. I have read a few of her books and always enjoy her plots,heros and settings. This book was too real in its depiction of the after affects of rape. It left a sad feeling through the whole story. I would have liked it better if the bad guy was punished some how for his atrocities, rather than just killed off. I wanted justice but, punishment for rape is impossible, how do you punish some one who muders a persons soul ?"
5,Dark Bringing Forth Light,"I didn't write a review of Once Forbidden initially because I wrote my series review on the first of the trilogy. When I saw what low ratings people were giving it, I thought I should interject. It was actually my favorite of the three. I loved the fact that the heroine of this book was one of the villains of the previous one. I almost didn't read it because I disliked her so much, but I'm glad I did. The evolution of her character is heartening. I'm not a big fan of fluff, and this book was dark and yet hopeful. It's the harsh reality that provides a shadow to the lighter side of the romance and makes it really stand out. If it were a painting, I would call it chiaroscuro. If you prefer Caravaggio and Rembrandt over Monet and Renoir then you will like this book."
3,Hoping for better,"I ordered this book because I've heard a lot about Brisbin as a historical romance author, and it was only after I ordered that I read a rather long excerpt of it on Brisbin's website. Good lord! The effect of her colorful use of colloquial speech was completely shot when she would make her characters say things such as ""I got caught up in taking an inventory of the supply rooms,"" and ""Did I pass out?"" Somehow I can't imagine a lairdess of medieval Scotland talking like a modern sales clerk...anyway, I still have yet to receive the book and I'm hoping that the plot and character development will help me overlook some of the little bumblings such as the ones I mentioned. I am optimistic!"
3,Nice space heater,"We replaced an identical heater. It lasted three years, then died. I didn't realize it was still under warranty.May look for something else when this one fails. One of the two is already rattling."
4,HZ-2030,This is our 3rd year with the Honeywell HZ 2030. It has performed very well. We keep our house temperature at about 60 degrees most of the time and my wife uses the HZ 2030 to warm up the kitchen or family room where we spend the most time.
2,Lasted 3 months,"Worked great for 3 months then just stopped working for some reason. Has a 5 year warranty, so will try to return to the company. We'll see how that goes ..."
1,Stopped working,I have a similar experience to the other reviewer. This product worked fine for the first week I owned it. I then noticed an odd rattling noise and blue sparks. Now it won't turn on.
1,Junk,"Junk. Clipper blade didn't work at all, and didn't seem the slightest bit sharp. Nose hair trimmer blade worked fine for a month or two, then got dull and began pulling terribly - a most unpleasant experience."
2,Almost adequate,"It seems to trim so-so, but don't buy it for any aspect of the spotlight. Its dim and useless. There's prpbably better ones out there, but I'm not sure how you'd tell."
2,DOA,"Out of the bubble pack, the light worked, but the blade did not turn at all. Even after changing the battery, no action whatsoever. After fiddling with the motor and the blade a bit, and some coarse language, I did get it to work. The performance, though, is feeble. I suspect that there is a vast difference between the quality and performance of the professional and the home products.You might have better results with a pair of scissors."
2,Didn't last long,This product works well but it quit working after just a few months. The construction of the battery contacts is rather flimsy.
1,Just plain awful,"I've had this one for a couple of years. The different heads are badly designed, very hard to switch them. The trimmer itself doesn't work well, you have to keep going over the same area over and over, and over and over. Lame. The little light is utterly useless, I have no idea who would ever use that. The eyebrow attachment is very hard to put on, but thankfully you'll never use it because it doesn't work at all as they advertise. Finally, the on/off switch is terribly designed, the mechanism shifted within the enclosure literally the first two weeks I got this, you can still turn it on and off but it's awkward.FAIL.I'm just amazed I've only now gotten a replacement and see what I've been missing."
3,good trimmer,"4/10/10: I have purchased and am VERY HAPPY with the WAHL Ear, Nose, and Brow Wet/Dry Battery Trimmer, Model 41559-300N that I purchased at Bed, Bath, and Beyond for $19.99. I have used it once, and although it took a little more time to cut the nose hairs than my trusty Panasonic ER411 did (like one reviewer said: you have to go over the same area again and again sometimes to get all the very long hairs), it cut down to the base of the hair like I wanted/left just a tiny stub behind and did not painfully tug or yank any of my hairs. I have used it only once, but I am very happy with it and highly recommend it. The packaging indicates the product has a generous 30-day money back guarantee and a 3-year limited warranty.I plan on updating this review after a few weeks/months to see how this product performs over time."
3,"Not bad, but the first Emma and Billie book was better","This novel seems like two novellas merged into one. Billie is trying to find evidence that a wealthy but mentally challenged young man did not kill his best friend. Emma tries to find the biological parents of an adopted child. Both of the plot lines would make excellent short stories, but they do not merge well into the same novel. Overall, I enjoyed it, but Ms. Roberts' work is generally better."
4,Whatever Doesn't Kill You,"Gillian Roberts has a talent for this sort of writing -- light, funny and addictive. I don't know if I would have enjoyed this book quite as much if I weren't already a devotee of the Amanda Pepper series. If you're not already a fan, I'd suggest starting with Caught Dead in Philadelphia. It could be my geographic prejudice, but I think the Pepper books are wittier and less predictable.Although I find Emma (and Zachary) somewhat stereotypical, from past experience I know that Gillian Roberts' characters evolve, so I'm betting that these will as well. Otherwise, Billie could end up investigating Emma's demise. Still, it's Gillian Roberts and ""cozy"" mysteries don't get too much better than that."
5,Wonderful!,"I don't usually write reviews here, but Gillian Roberts is one of my very favorite mystery writers and I particularly loved this book. These are terrifically engaging characters. I loved the feeling that the author really knows the setting and I thought the plot was terrific. I recommend all of her books highly, and especially this one!"
5,The Best of Bix; The best restoration,"This is a great Bix collection which Robert Parker has done an incredible job of cleaning and restoring the sound. Some of these records are pretty early in what the late Don Brown called the ""dixie cup"" microphone era. An added bonus is the great early Duke Ellington growling trumpter Bubber Miley plays with Bix on ""Rockin Chair."" I first heard a Bubber Miley record in 1969 and I've been a fan ever since. See also my review of Richard Sudhalter's Lost Chords. This CD features the musicans that Sudhalter writes about."
5,Great horn player,Good example of his work during his short life. For a man who could not read music he is an exceptional musician.
4,Compelling live performer,"Seeing Earl Thomas perform over the weekend was a pefect complement to the Hi Records compilaton I have been listening to recently. Thomas is a compelling live performer, in the style of Al Green, and that alone should make people buy this album. He believes what he is singing and his intelligent conversation with the audience between songs was quite refreshing.Strong band, back-up singers. I'd go see him again."
2,Phewww! Great moisturizing product ~ terrible smell!,"I love Australian Gold products and was excited to buy Forever After All Day Moisturizer at a good price. Unfortunately, I'm very disappointed in this AG because of the horrible scent/smell. I thought I was buying the summer-like scent I've come to expect from Australian Gold, but this is ... phewwww!To be fair, the silky moisturizing factor is great ~ my skin felt wonderful and soft for hours after I applied. However, the scent (difficult to described, but it reminds me of something my grandmother used in her 80's) is much too overpowering and much too strong. I grudgingly gave 2 stars (simply for the moisturizing factor).I purchased 2 bottles and might end up giving them to the nice little old lady that lives on my street. Hopefully, the smell won't be too strong for her senses."
3,was decent,"i bought this based on others good reviews. It wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't as good as i was expecting based on what people said. The smell was pretty bland not great but not horrible. I have extremely dry skin so just using this wasn't enough to keep my skin healthy i also put coconut oil all over my body every time i got out of the shower. It was a little sticky and took a bit to sink into my skin. Also the pump on my bottle broke really fast. But over all it did the job but i don't think i will be buying it again because of the smell."
3,Lovely moisturizer,"This moisturizer is thick and creamy and does a great job but,the smell is unbearable so I will not purchase this again."
1,Smells,"You can not use this product. I was so disappointed, because I use almost all of Australian Gold Products. This smells so strong if you were to put it on your body they could smell you a mile away. It is so strong it is offensive. No one could stand to be around you."
2,Not that moisturizing,"When I read reviews on how amazing this lotion smelled, I gave it a try. Don't waste your money. It does have a nice smell but it really doesn't moisturize that well. I have better results with a generic cocoa butter lotion at Target. Also, I noticed that my knees actually looked drier while using this product. I actually had to use a second moisturizer to counter what this product did!"
2,Moisturizing but stinks,This lotion is very moisturizing but the smell of it is very strong and reminds me of an older woman's perfume. The lotion works well but due to the scent I do not plan to purchase this lotion again.
2,Moisturizing but smelly!,"Im not usually picky about my lotions and not too sensitive to smells but this one i just dont like. It works well, moisturizing and doesnt leave you feeling greasy. But! I absolutely hate the smell of it, so much so i couldnt use it anymore after only a few times. I just cannot stand how it smells. I didnt think a smell would bother me so much but the scent from this lingers on ALL day. Blech!"
4,Forever After is the lotion for you tanners!,"Australian Gold Forever After All Day moisturizer is perfect for those of you die-hard tanners or for those of you that tan less often. This moisturizer is thick, rich, and coats your skin in silk as you apply it to your body. With its vanilla bean fragrance and intense hydration, this is one moisturizer you will enjoy applying often even though one application is all you need. It's more than just an after-tan lotion, Forever After leaves your tanned skin looking and feeling soft and supple."
4,Nice light scent,"I love the smell of this overall I think it is just as good as any other lotion, but it is cheaper than most with being in a big bottle."
3,"Quick Shipping, questionable product.......","I ordered the product on Monday and it arrived at my door today (Wednesday). Couldn't have asked for more abrupt shipping.Product came unsealed, but overall the product is as described. Questionable ""knock-off"" as the label on the product isn't the most professionally done, seems cheap and imitated. I however have not used a ""legit"" forever after lotion before, so I can not be certain that this isn't the ""real thing"". I have seen the bottles before and they seemed better made and the ""legit"" product seemed a little thicker than the shipment I received today.Overall, this product was worth the low amount that i paid for it.Unsure if I would reorder this product."
2,Broke me out!!!,"At first I loved this lotion but then I realized it was making the eczema on my hands flare up and it was also making my chest/shoulders/& back break out in pimples/blackheads. It's a very thick lotion, is probably why it's clogging my pores. If you have very dry skin then it would probably work for you."
5,Very nice!,"I really like this moisturizer, very soothing after a tanning session, I would recommend to all! I have bought this product quite a few times."
4,It's good,Before I got this lotion I didn't use any after sun lotion and with this lotion I don't personally see too much of a difference but it smells nice and makes my skin feel good but it hasn't done much in the holding my tan department
3,Okay,Okay product. I understand its no longer being distributed to tanning salons so grab some while its cheap. Could smell better btw.
3,just okay,"i don't see anything special about this lotion, especially for the price. it smells okay, kind of like the ""milk"" brand in they blue and white bottle the sell at regular stores. however, other lotions at walmart or any convenient store work just as well and even better. this stuff didn't moisturize my skin for 24 hours and i wake up with dry skin every morning."
5,Great Lotion,"I have used this lotion for after tanning for years and I love it. It does a great job of making your skin feel great and the smell is both fantastic and fits any gender. Great stuff, great price, cant beat it!"
2,Christmas Oratorio--the first half,"Good performance, but nothing in the description supplied gives any hint that this is ONLY THE FIRST HALF of the Christmas Oratorio. There are a total of six cantatas in the oratorio, for the first three days of Christmas, New Year's Day, the Sunday after New Year's Day, and the Feast of the Epiphany. This disk contains only the first three. The disk case plainly reads ""Weihnachtsoratorium, Kantaten 1-3,"" so I must assume the incorrect listing came from someone in Amazon who didn't know enough about the work."
2,A Big Disappointment,"I, too, find it hard to believe that the author of The Women's Room wrote this junk. There was never any plausible reason why the main character was even attracted to George. He was a jerk. Everytime he talked, he barked. His posture was dejected. There was nothing attractive about him in the slightest. How can you get involved in someone's love fantasies when you think it's unbelievable that she would have a second thought about this guy? The narrator's recollections of her early life were much more interesting and believable. An easy read, but annoying."
2,"So now women, too, claim men and women can't be friends?","I loved the previous novels by Ms. French, but this one leaves me feeling a bit sick.Apparently the theme of her latest is that it is unacceptable for a man to enjoy speaking to a woman, have lunch with her when he is in town, but NOT intend to have a sexual relationship with her -- though he's given no indication he wants such a relationship, and reacts negatively to all physical advances by the woman.It's hard enough for us single-by-choice women to find friends (male or female) without books like this scaring off the few men who still think friendship is possible!"
3,An interesting but seldom heard opera,"First, I would say that Lalo was a better composer of instrumental music than of vocal music. Since other reviewers have described the plot, I won't repeat it here. The singing was mostly adequate but not very exciting; the orchestra was very good. Staging (including scenery, costumes) was also adequate but rather static, with the same scene used for all acts both inside the palace and outside.If, like me, you are curious to see an opera by Lalo, this is worth getting since it is the only DVD of this opera available. But it is neither a great opera nor an outstanding performance."
2,Not His Best,"I came very close to putting this book down without finishing it several times. How many times can you read, ""I can't tell you that,"" ""I'd rather not say,"" and ""I'm not answering that"" before you get fed up?The storyline was a mish-mosh of totally implausible events. The events weren't even exciting or thrilling...they were boring, and made you skim through a good majority of the book. I fell asleep three times reading it.Disappointing for such a talented author."
4,Very good!!,"I've read better, but this was a nice change of pace from what I was reading at the time. It was different and entertaining, and well written. Good character development."
2,Disappointing,"Phillip Margolin is one of my favorite authors, but when I read this book I was sad to think he has lost his desire to write a fantastic story. This one was so slow and predictable. It was an effort to finish it. Very disappointing."
1,"Awful, implausible, anachronistic . . .","This is a dreadful book. It has an improbable plot, thin characterizations, and sloppy writing. For an example of sloppy writing, his 1970 teenagers describe things as ""awesome."" Dude, awesome wasn't in teen parlance in the 70s.Give it a pass, and don't believe that Margolin compares in any way to Harlan Coben or Michael Connelly. He is not in their league."
4,Excellent,Phillip Margolin is one of my favorite authors of popular fiction. His feel for the region in which he lives makes his stories particularly interesting. I enjoy him as I do James Hall who lives in southern Florida. This was one of his best.
3,Not his best work,"If your a Margolin fan you will see a difference in this book. The book is not an easy read, at least the first half. It has too much information, it just drags you down. I thought something was different in his last book, but this one is not his typical writting.Normally I couldn't put one of his books down, but this one took me 5 days to get half way thru. The book did pick up in the second half and the last 100 pages where page-burners. But it was a long time coming. I was expecting more."
2,Ignorance on parade,"Well, it's entertaining in a gross sort of way, but evidently Mr. Margolin has never had any contact with the military or he'd know that one of the first laws in military service is that if you follow an illegal order you're liable for the results. His principal character never would have been able to escape liability for his actions even though they were ordered by his military superior. It's one important difference between our military and Hitler's military."
2,Very slow,"I am a huge fan of Margolin. Had been expecting this book with great anticipation.Our two main characters - Morelli and Vanessa, both have deep, dark secrets that will eventually link them together. But first, we have to do through endless pages of boring interactions (the relationship with Morelli and the kid was so sugary) that it makes you want to skip to the end of the book.Margolin's usual flow in the storyline practically does not exist in this book. His transition from main characters (who are not even in the same geographical area for the longest time) is ackward and extremely drawn out.Although I did like the Morelli character, the Vanessa one left me cold.Margolin fills his novel up with too much detail and fluff and when he actually gets to the nitty-gritty, its boring.This one is a pass."
3,STILL WATERS NOT SO DEEP,"In LOST LAKE, Philip Margolin tackles government conspiracy at its utmost level. While the book's labyrinthine plot is at times too far fetched to be credible, Margolin does manage to offer some twists and exciting action sequences. The book as a whole, however, is not one of his best. It all revolves around Vanessa Wingate Koehler and her previous lover, Carl Rice aka Dan Morelli, who is jailed after a violent assault at a little league game. Seems Vanessa thinks her father, General Wingate, once headed a really covert force of assassins, one of whom is Rice/Morelli. Wingate is also a frontrunner in the latest presidential election. No one believes Vanessa's wild story and she hires a rising attorney, Ami, to defend Carl.It's all rather complicated and we know who to believe; Margolin just adds too much and doesn't really keep the reader focused. While not a real loser, LOST LAKE failed to meet my expectations."
2,Caution Editors: We're Actually Paying Attention,"I've enjoyed Margolin's work in the past, but this novel is long on verbiage and short on real impact. Also, there is a critical error in the text when Kirkpatrick refers to the recently escaped Morelli character as Rice (the true name of the as-yet-unknown mystery man). This threw me for a loop while I was trying to figure out who knew what about whom. (Has anyone else caught this error?) Sorry, Mr. Margolin, but I think this work was a trite amalgam of plenty of better-paced action thrillers. And, I never really felt sympathetic for the cardboard Ami. In short, ""Lost Lake"" was just long-winded, overly contrived caca doody. More like ""Lost Time"" for me. Now, excuse me while I get back to Ellroy, Bruen, McBain, Mankell, Rankin, Reginald Hill, and the others who can really craft a fine tale and fill it with characters who feel alive."
2,Disappointing,"Philip Margolin has made a very nice living out of writing tightly-plotted thrillers featuring well-drawn characters. Unfortunately, he has accomplished neither with this book. The plot is implausible, the characters are almost uniformly irritating, and the pace of the storytelling is confusing--all building to an anticipated crescendo, except that there is no crescendo. The book ends with a whimper without even tying up all of the loose ends.It's surprising that a book this underwhelming could come from an author as accomplished and respected as Margolin. I suspect he had a publisher's deadline to meet, and the result looks rushed, undeveloped, and sophomoric--especially compared to his earlier work."
5,Outstanding!!,"A violent incident at a little league game, a gruesome murder on Lost Lake twenty years prior, a confessed murderer, and an ex-mental patient with conspiracy theories who happens to be the daughter of a General running for president. How all this and other dark events that span the time between the two incidents are related is something attorney Ami Vergano must discover as she becomes caught between reality and delusion. The thrill is trying to figure out which is which.This book packs a powerful punch filled with complex characters and themes. It kept me on edge--I simply couldn't put it down. This is the first novel I've read of Phillip Margolin and I'm hooked. I can't wait to read the others!"
4,near perfect....,"have had the book awhile , skipped thnrough it a few times , what a mistake ...reread it recently , awesome ..i hate to admit it , being a man , i got choked up at the end as the two anti heros go off into the mist so to say.only problem , no psychological background on the general who masterminds all the detours for our so called good guys.would be nice if there was a sequel , as there were a few loose ends..would make an awesome movie , plenty of actionhave browsed over a few older books by mr margolin , but this one was hard to put downcould have been a five"
4,Another great thriller!,"Nicci French has this endless dark imagination! Although the name of the book seems decieving after having read it, the book never the less kept me going till the end. She writes so well I forget that it's 4'oclock in the morning and have to get to bed! I just have to finish it!"
4,a compelling page-turner!,"When a disturbed derelict is caught hanging around a London schoolyard it is part of Dr. Kit Quinn's job to interviewing him & when he attacks her, he cracks her self-confidence & she begins to dream about a red room where nightmares become real.The red room is a frightening concept, something we all have deeply inside us, where our deepest fears lie. When Kit finally finds the truth, it seems reality is, if possible, even worse than her red room.A compelling page-turner with an ending you'd never expect.Another winner from Nicci French!"
4,Oh What a Tangled Web We Weave...............,"The Red Room takes place in London, and Nicci French lets the personality of that city really come through. Kit Quinn, the female protagonist, is a psychiatrist called upon to evaluate a bizarre homeless man in police custody. The consequence of her interview is brutal and leads her to become involved in a grisly murder investigation. Along the way, her personal life comes very much into play. The clues are few and far between, leaving the reader with little opportunity to play detective. There is, however, a nice twist or two at the end. Maybe not as suspenseful as Beneath the Skin, but still a good read."
2,Not at all compelling,"I've read other Nicci French books, and this one was very disappointing. There was nothing compelling about the book, and I didn't really care about the characters. I did finish it, but wished I hadn't bothered with it."
2,A Chore to Get Through,"I didn't find the mystery very compelling and found it hard to care about any of the characters. I also hated the ending, it didn't make sense to me."
2,"Dont waste your time on this book - read ""Beneath the skin""","I read ""Beneath the skin"" by Nicci French a year ago and couldnt put it down, because it was suspenseful and cleverly written.""Red Room"" surprised me - I would not have thought that the same author can write such a listless, quite boring novel. The characters are not well crafted. The book starts off quite tense and promises a lot, but then loses itself in cluelessly plotted scenes, in which the protagonist doesnt receive any information (like the reader). At the end, there awaits some constructed solution, which is not presented in any thriller-like fassion. The quasi-love story, which accompanies the story, bored the hell out of me.Please, dear Mrs. French! Do not feel pressurized by your publisher! Take your time! Think that you really want to write a great book like ""Beneath the skin"" again and dont dissapoint us again.ThanksMartin"
2,Too Many Cooks Spoil the Stew,"Dr. Kit Quinn, a young English psychiatrist, is a resilient woman. She's back on the job consulting with the London Police Department just months after having her face sliced by a bizarre, fixated loner. Now she's helping the police with a murder investigation, the prime suspect in which is none other than her attacker.The ""Red Room"" starts out with promise, but quickly turns into a disappointment. ""Nicci French"" is actually the pseudonym of a married writing team, and the book reads like it. It is very difficult for writers to collaborate on a seamless novel, particularly when it comes to crafting a suspenseful plot. The story never generates any real thrills, and the story is only mildly interesting.It was refreshing to read a story set in London; it was a nice change from the typical American mysteries I usually read. The murder investigation, however -- the heart of the mystery -- left me cold.Reviewed by Mystery Ink"
3,A Schivelbein,"I loved Nicci French's first 2 books and put this one on order as soon as I saw she was coming out with a new one. Wow was I disappointed. I had a hard time finishing it. The book was nothing like her others. There was no suspense and when you find out who the killer is It seems completely unbelievable. I would not recommend this. If you want to read a good book by her get ""killing me softly"" that was a good read. I sure hope her next one is better."
3,Some useful information but not geared for the typical famil,"While there was useful information in the book, I found several major drawbacks. The author targets families with extended periods of time to spend in Europe (her family went for 4 months) so much of the discussion is on home rentals, car purchase/repurchase etc and many of the activities they enjoyed reflected the extended period of time they had to spend. While it would be wonderful to have that amount of time, I don't think it is realistic for most families. It is important to note that the book is also geared to families with school age children (you have to read in a few pages to find that out.) No help here if you want to take a preschooler. Third, the author's family doesn't really care for cities so major cities such as Paris and London get only short mentions."
2,Good material for long term european vacations,"This is a good read for those considering long-term European vacation with kids in tow. Compared with Rick Steve's Backdoor books, the perspective is inappropriately focused on 4-month monster vacations. Most of us dash through our European vacations in 2 or 3 weeks. References to Italy (and Italians) are strangely negative: ""Venice is full of thieves and con-artists"". The tour of Italian cities includes big-city destinations such as Rome, Naples and Milan, yet leaves out gems like Florence, Lucca, Siena, Assisi, etc. Good insight into travel-related doldrums, depression and family togetherness issues. Covered teenager rebellion with refreshing anecdotes."
1,take your kids to europe,"This book was a BIG disappointment. Some parts are useful (how to live abroad, find housing long term, etc) but for tips on practical tips on accommodations, dining, places to see--I found it necesssary to refer to other books. Could have done without this book altogether. (I inadvertently gave this book as a gift to a family visiting Paris for the 1st timne and was embarrassed that the recipient was less than thrilled with this book)"
3,Some good hints and ideas for family travelling,"This book is cut from a different bolt of cloth compared to the Rick Steve's Backdoor series. More emphasis on family dynamics along with some very helpful insights from children's perspectives of the travel experience.Impractical focus on 4-month monster vacations. Strangely negative comments about Italy (and Italians): ""Venice is full of thieves and con-artists"". The Italian tour guide lists big-city destinations (Rome, Naples, Milan), but fails to cover smaller gems like Florence, Sienna, Lucca, Assisi.Irritating emphasis on penny pinching. Recommending youth hostels is probably poor advice for those traveling with young children."
5,Hypnotic Harmonics,"It takes just a few seconds of listening to the first track, ""Batoumambe,"" on ""Baro,"" Habib Koité and Bamada's third album, to realize that this is powerful, unique, and very good music. Especially evident are the use of harmonics across many instruments and many songs. The harmonics have a hypnotic quality to them that must be experienced to be fully understood.For listeners not familiar with Koité, he sings (primarily) in the Bambara language of his native Mali. This language adds significantly to the entire musical composition. Koité's calm and strong voice is really a separate, and powerful, instrument across these works.From the upbeat and rhythmic ""Sin Djen Djen"" to the rich tapestry of ""Sambara,"" Koité weaves a consistent harmonic approach to music through a variety of songs and tempos. Highly recommended to all listeners."
4,"Cheesier than a Spanish omlet, yet suprisingly entertaining","This is, by far, the cheesiest, corniest collection of comics I have ever read in my life. Incredible unrealistic things happen just at the right time, villains attack with no purpose, plots are left with holes the size of doughnuts in them. And yet...It's fun. It's a whole lot of fun. Sure it's kinda stupid sometimes, but you'll cheer on Reed, Sue, Johnny, and Ben none the less! After all, isn't that what comics are supposed to be?"
3,"Not Horrible, Not Great","It's kinda strange to see the Fantastic Four doing such silly things. I've seen them go into the Negative Zone and fight Galactus. Seeing them fighting Dr. Doom while he's wearing silly costumes and using ridiculous technology is kinda demeaning to a great super hero team.It is nice to see the origin of this team and the writing of Stan Lee, it's also kinda silly to see them running around in a flying bathtub. Check it out if you have the time."
3,Colorless,I was surprised to find that this Marvel comic collection volume was in black and white instead of the original color.Not being in color diminishes the experience for the reader.
2,"""Essential"" stories. Flawed format.","The format of the Essential series is softcover, black and white (many times muddy), printed on cheap, pulpy paper. The classic stories in these books deserve better treatment by Marvel. Do yourself a favor and instead buy the Marvel Masterworks series, which are hardbacks, printed in color, on high quality paper. They are worth the difference in price."
3,"Excellent selection, but in black and white.","This volume contains the first 20 issues of the Fantastic Four and the first Annual. Right from the starting blocks, Lee and Kirby created one of the freshest and durable set of characters in comics' history, as this volume proves. These stories contain the germs of the Marvel Universe to come: IE the return of the Submariner, the Hulk, Spider-Man, Dr. Doom, the Watcher, etc. Lee and Kirby didn't waste any time in producing cutting edge stories. However, this volume is black and white, and while that cuts the cost down, it does detract from the artwork."
5,The Birth of the Silver Age of Comics,"Every few decades, a comic emerges which changes everything in the medium. Action Comics #1 with the emergence of Superman. Frank Miller's ""Batman: The Dark Night Returns"". And bisecting these two milestones? Fantastic Four #1, the comic which gave birth to the Silver Age.This legendary issue is included, along with the 19 issues of the title which followed it, and the 1st FF annual, in ""Essential Fantastic Four vol. 1"". Each issue is absolutely packed with some of the most innovative characters and writing ever seen in comics. Aside from the truly radical members of the FF (a superteam that bickers? This ain't the Justice League), readers are treated to the first appearances of the Sub-Mariner, the shapeshifting Skrulls, and Dr. Doom.This is a top-drawer collection which every comics fan should own."
4,I hope the later edition reflects recent trends in physics research.,"Even though this book is written by a successful physicist, it seems to me to suffer from the usual problem of discussions of the philosophy of quantum mechanics: too much on philosophy and too little physics.My view is that qm only violates local reality from a classical point of view. The Schrodinger equation is local and its wave functions can serve as a bizarre sort of reality. This leads to different philosophical questions."
1,Gods way of hiding,"Heisenberg's original uncertainty principal showed that soon as one tries to look at the way things work in Quantum mechanics, that just by looking at it changes it and thus it can't be patterned and everything is unpredictable. Einstein could not handle this because he believed God's design could be figured out and that it would be simple and elegant. What I believe he never caught on to was that he is but a mere human. No human can unravel the designs of Gods! His arrogance was his undoing. Quantum Mechanics has allowed us to glympse God's design. I believe Heisenberg's ideas of probability and never truly being able to unravel it all is God's encryption. Therefore I think we need to approach this as a little bit of both, Einstein and Heisenberg's ideas."
5,!!!!!The Hottest Album In The Game!!!!!!,This Album Is Straight Fire I Gotta The Same Day That I Came Out I Love It.........Go JR Is Your Time The Best Dipset Rapper
5,B3ST ALBUM OF THE YEAR,THIS IS ALBUM IS STRAIGHT HOT JR WRITER IS DOIN HIS THING ONE OF THE BEST RAPPER RITE NOW ALL THE SONGS IN THE ALBUM ARE FIRE
1,There's no History in the making in this mess.,"History in the making is a disaster in the making, this album sucked so badly that it qualifies as the candidate for the worst of 2006, I Hated this Album from J.R. Writer who is a very talented rapper, but he needs to leave that godawful group, because they don't deserved to be real hip-hop, the lyrical content is watered down, the songs are contrived and the title is ridiculous.History in the Making is a historical mess."
2,Wackness,"J.R. Writer sounds like a baby CamRon in voice, flow, and rhyme scheme. Even though in my opinion he's a little bit better than CamRon, that's still not saying much (since CamRon is arguably the worst rapper out right now). The album isn't as horrible as CamRon's album earlier this year either. There are actually some songs that are tight to me and if they aren't tight...they're at least listenable. But listenable doesn't make it good. JR Writer doesn't spit any game, he just raps often rambling along in his slow flow. His rhymes while technically sound, are boring. The production is riding though...always love Dipset beats and really they are the only thing that keep me interested. However, JR Writer is the most talented of anyone in Dipset I've heard so far and has a little potential. Good songs include Byrd Call, Xtaci, and That's A Bet. 2 stars."
5,THE ALBUM IS OFF DA HOOK JR WRITER IS THE BEST RAPPER,THIS IS ALBUM IS CRACK THE MONEY IS WAITIN JR. YOU SHOULD SELL MORE THAN 10 MILLION COPIES JR WRITER IS 2NICEI BEEN WAITIN 4DIS ALBUM SENSE YEARN N FINALLY IS HERE JR WRITER IS THE BEST
1,Seriously?,"I don't understand how this product can have two positive reviews. It's a really cheap product, worth less than a dollar each in my opinion. And it's basically just a open sleeve with two open ends so if you were to get any wind at all in your vehicle you'd probably lose the paperwork, and the clip isn't designed to hold the paperwork in. You'd be better off using a rubber band to attach your paperwork to your visor. Luckily Amazon returns are really easy, but I still lost six bucks in shipping. I never felt so scammed from an Amazon purchase, I would never recommend this to anyone."
2,much too small,"The holder is much too small to hold even a normal sized vehicle registration. I guess it might be good for proof of insurance and such.. it is fairly flimsy also, but I did not expect too much as the price was right."
5,Best controller I've ever used,"The P3 is head and shoulders above the other controllers I have owned and used. I do not haul commercially, but I do haul boats and trailers up to 10,000 pounds gross weight. The controller is intuitive and easy to install. If you get one of these, spend the extra money, about $10, and get the Tekonsha wiring harness. Wiring it up yourself is not worth the time."
5,Perfect!!,Great product. Simple to use. I haul a carson 20 footer stops it great. I like the extra control going down hills and in the city. Five stars all the way.
5,awsome,Great controller with lots of features. A must if you tow multiple trailers. Easy to set up. Great display and easy to read. All around great product for the price. Recommend getting the vehicle specific harness as it makes installation a breeze.
3,on the road again,Haven't had a chance to test it out yet.......hhhj hhhj jjjh mmmj mmm mmm bgh jjk kkj llk lll jkh
3,Just try to contact Tekonsha for help.,"First unit arrived with cosmetic defect in display but worked properly. Second unit has issue. I have been trying to contact Tekonsha but I can't get them to reply.Oh, and I have a limited lifetime warranty."
3,Nice,"Needed a brake controller and this one came highly recommended. Smaller than it looks, so fits the Jeep JK perfectly. But, I could only give it three stars because Tekonsha does not make a plug-in adaptor for the Jeep JK, so this is a ""wire by hand"" deal that takes some time in the cramped quarters of the Jeep. They make the plug ins for many other vehicles, don't understand their lack of coverage for the Jeep. Build is high quality, and I like the manual control on the bottom, just in case you don't feel that the automatic braking is enough in certain situations."
5,Precision Tile,Great product! I will buy from seller again! This controller works much better than the last controller I used and install was very simple! I love the functions this controller has on it and would highly recomend it to others!
5,"was as easy to install as they said it would be, but have not had the opportunity to take it on the road",I expect that it will work well as it has performed well so far and has gotten great reviews though I will try to get back to provide an update after I do get it on the road. As I pull over 3 different trailers all the time I expect the automatic features to be valuable
5,OMG - Will not own anything else again!,"WOW, simple connection I bought the cable for my truck, it was ""plug - N - Play"" I didn't even follow the initial setup instructions. Installed and rolled. Works great. Just bumped the max voltage down for my load, Great controller!"
2,It looks alot better than it sounds,"This album is a messy collection of live blues cuts. Many are simply terrible. It seems the producers were trying to find some crappy live cuts that no one wanted so they could throw together an album that looks like it's worth while. That said, there are a few highlights. Magic Sam, Son House, and John Mayall all have decent performances on this album."
1,Peter Bailey's fiasco,"Book of semi-historical signifance. Normal everyday reader will find book boring and ""long"" winded. Good primary sources but not a book with a ""bite."" No new information given to change this person's mind about the Victorian Era in England. Bailey's thesis is lost in the mire of words."
1,A Complete Waste of Time and Money,"By far the worst album I have heard from the dwarves. Sugarfix, Thank Heaven for Little Girls, and the Dwarves are Young and Good Looking are just miles ahead of this one. I'm a major dwarves fan, but I couldnt even bring myself to listen to this one all the way through..."
1,Die!Just Die!!!!!!,I got this record just resently and it plain out sux!Their old stuff is the best!!!The cd has only 3 rocking songs and that's it.Do yourself a favor and buy their singles album.This is so not worth the money.
4,Not Bad,Usually the pack comes with 1 or 2 real jersey relics/ cards but the rest are fake So it worth it
5,Perfect fit,"Love this windbreaker. I ordered size Medium Maroon color, very nice, the length fits perfectly, sleeves are normal length (not too long), and nice looking jacket. Where I live it's not too cold or raining yet, but I wear it in the chilly morning and I've even had compliments! When it does get colder, I know a warm top underneath will fit fine. Even though the jacket is one layer, stitching is very good so I know it will hold up to a lot of wear and washings. Note: cannot be put in dryer, ironed or anything but delicate wash. The label is more specific, be sure to read it.This jacket does not have the tight gathered wrists that windbreakers normally have. Instead they are like (large) rubber bands (too wide) made to stretch for someone with very thick wrists or something, but I like it so much I'll keep it anyway. Also, there is no lining inside but I guess that's what 'lightweight' is all about."
5,NICE!,I am very pleased with this jacket - quality & fit. Perfect for those times that you need just one (or one more) layer.
3,Love the color,"Sleeves are a little long. But it's exactly what it says it is. Light weight, but not too thin. a little baggy, but not too long on the waist. Beautiful purple. Convenient rain jacket for the Bay Area. Was looking for one without a hood and now I found it in my favorite color :)"
5,Great product!!,"I am very pleased with this jacket--considering the very low price, I was amazed to find it so well-made. I just ordered another one!!"
4,Quick Fix,"I purchased a pre-owned vehicle where the seats looked like the previous owner had driven the Baja while drinking coffee with a lidless cup. These seat covers took care of that ""eye sore"" nicely at a very reasonable price. I've had them about a month now and although they are very thin,are holding up to my sliding in and out of the seats many times daily. I recommend these as a ""quick"" fix and not for a car enthusiast that would want durability for years to come as I believe they won't last the test of time. For the price...I'm happy with this purchase."
2,Car seat cover,Did not fit seats. Not very useful. Once dogs sat on seat it came off. Also did not fit front seat very well.
2,Chinese Crap,"For the price they are barely acceptable. They need an opening on one side for vehicles with arm rests otherwise they are useless and will not fit unless cut up the side!! The color is much lighter than pictured and the plastic clips are complete junk. Spend more, get more."
3,Adds a few more years tot he seats.,"The product looks good and does the job. The covers do not quite fit seats in the Mitsubishi Mirage, but for the price it provide an adequate cover. The covers look much better than the holes and cuts spreading on the seats now. The installation instructions were understandable. The covers fit tightly in some areas but a bit loose in others. If I were more patient, I could probably get them to fit better."
3,You get what you pay for,"These definitely seem cheap when you put them on your car, but hey, they WERE cheap! Protects the seat fine, if you don't mind it looking a little nylon-like."
4,Perfect,Fit great and look great also! A bit flimsy but work for what they are intended to do. Amazon did not send the color that was shown but they still work. I would give Amazon one star on this but the seat covers deserve a 4!!
2,Not something I would buy again . . .,"These seat covers appear to fit well. However, they shift and bunch up when people get into and out of the car. Also, the seam where the seat is joined to the back is already starting to rip. I know this is a high tension area, but I expected this would therefore be reinforced and it is not. I suppose for the price these seat covers are ok, but I with the overall good reviews I had hoped for more."
4,sweet as cover,"I've had several jobs working in the field getting dirty and gross but never did I need to use my car for work. My new job requires me to drive to and from the beach regularly and I sometimes leave sandy, sweaty, wet and generally pretty ripe. This cover does the trick for keeping the drivers seat clean. It's easy to install and when I need to wash it taking it off is no problem at all. It comes with two and I would put the second one on the passenger seat but it would cover up the back seat pocket which I like to use, so I would say that that's it's only down fall. Oh, also, I have a 2005 civic so if you're wondering if it works for that model, then here's your answer: it sure does!"
3,bucket seat covers,"They cover my seats and will protect them, however they don't fit like they should. I am unable to tie and secure them like instructed in the directions. I guess the seats in my Scion TC are built different than the seats these covers were designed to fit."
2,Universal Fit Seat Covers,I guess you get what you pay for. They were sadly much to large for my particular bucket seats so I returned this item.
1,disappointment,"you can not put the dryer with the nozzle on in it.. grrrr.. if you have the elchim, the nozzle is pretty hard to remove.. what a pain"
1,Too small,This blow dryer holder is too small my sedu blow dryer coudnt fit =( i was disapointed.... if you have a blow dryer thats short and thick this wont help at all but if you have those long skinny blow dryers than this would be perfect....
1,Disappointed,"I thought I had ordered black, but it was white which doesn't look good with my red Elchim hairdryer. I also canot put the hairdryer in the stand with the straightening attachment in place. Much more hassle than it is worth."
2,Just Let Jennifer Beals Sport 'Em...,"I can't live with the guilt anymore (sob)...I have to review this product. I hate to rain on everyone's parade, but these suckers were tight on my kid's legs as an infant, and like I have stated in an ""Old Navy"" review, she could be Skeletor's mascot (her older sis could be his girlfriend). Yes, I did follow the laundering directions...maybe I just got stuck with a substandard pair; maybe they have improved since two and a half years ago, or maybe they just are terrible. I have since learned that I will take a boring, comfy, durable pair of leggings over baby haute couture any day now."
5,LOVE Babylegs!,"I got a bunch of these for my son when he was a baby as I was tired of having his little ankle exposed when his pants would ride up as I held him on my hip, or having to change his diaper at the park or in the back of the car at the grocery store. It's great to be able to remove the pants and change the diaper without exposing any more of their skin than is necessary. I still have the BabyLegs I purchased for him (he's almost 5) and not only use them on my almost 2 year old daughter, but my son still wears them (both as leg and arm warmers). He loves his ""Leggies"" as he calls them."
4,Like it!,"Really cute color and good quality. Haven't been able to use it much since it's summertime, but hope it'll come in good use for the summer. The size is good for my 5mo old, and I think it should still fit her when she's 10mo or so. I'm really hoping she'll still be able to use it until she's at least 1yr."
2,People aboard the ISS should be weightless!,"Although the interior of the International Space Station looked very much like the real thing, the glaring error that the protagonist seemed to be under 1 g, when he should have been weightless, distracted me for the whole movie."
1,"Time Keeps Slipping, Slipping, Slipping Into the Future",I want my 86 minutes back! I don't understand why some film makers insist on forcing the viewer to participate on every minute level with the feelings of the character. In the case of this film it focused on boredom. Very intense & unrelenting boredom. The film starts with a civil war soldier rambling on and on about the meaning of life. It then suddenly shifts to the year 2040 and then follows the days and days and days of isolation and boredom of a stranded astronaut. He is board and the filmmaker makes sure that we are board too. You see film isn't just about story telling it also creates experience so beware of this film because its maker wants you to be very bored.
5,LOVE this film!!,"Ok, I'm going to start with, YES this Film has similarities to other movies, particularly, '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Now the MAIN difference between the two films is that one of them has a man stranded in space IN it(2001), and the other IS about a man stranded in space (Love), big difference.'2001', has it's own weird psychedelic message about where human intelligence came from and other strange things.'Love', is about being isolated. Missing human contact, communication, and love. It shows (from the producer/director's) ideas what happens to a human without that contact. It's an amazing message on how important it is to be loved and have that contact. It's entire musical score is created by Angels & Airwaves. An amazing band in my opinion.I HIGHLY recommend this film if you're interested in sci-fi and human nature.L )VE"
3,2013: A Space Opera,"This is a thought provoking film. Set in space but features other scenes and times too. It won't be for everyone however as it's slow paced. Quite psychadelic. I'm not sure why there are these interviews. Various characters give their views on life. The actress is pretty. You should see 2001: A Space Odeyssy, Solaris, Sunshine. Also you'll find books by Stephen Baxter on Amazon such as Coalescent, Conqueror, Emperor, Timelike Infinity. I am looking forward to the film Cloud Atlas."
2,Was good in the 50s,The cartoons in this video are outdated. Don't buy it. The voices and the images are made for the 40s and 50s.
3,Ground level.,"Lance,Lance,Lance you have guitar potential but hear me out LESS IS MORE.On this album you have the grooves albeit a tad repetitious and some nice playingbut what on earth possess this guy to try and fit a thousand notes in one bar ofmusic is beyond me.(maybe it's the show off factor)Look! it's an alright album with some cool grooves but nothing to write home aboutoh! by the way the girl on the inside sleeve what's her phone number again?"
3,Not the size as advertised but good price,"Here are the specs from my digital caliper:Small tamper is 50.11 - 50.48mm (1.973 - 1.9875"")Large tamper is 55.79 - 56.33mm (2.1965 - 2.2175"")Both tamper surfaces are not flat"
2,Lousy for Non-Pressurized Baskets,"If you are using a Non-Pressurized Espresso basket, don't bother with this tamper. However, if you plan on using it for the pressuzied kind, go for it, and that is where it earns its two stars.Another troubling concern that I have with this product is that in no way is it 60mm and not even 58mm. I could not get this to even come close to fitting the commercial 58mm basket I use. I would say that it's probably closer to 55-56mm on the larger end.again, I could be wrong, but based on tampers i've used in the past, this one seems severely undersized."
4,Stronger than it looks,Quite happy with this tamper. It's cheap. I only needed it as a temporary fix until my rattleware came back in stock and it did the job/
3,It's ok.,"It doesn't fit my espresso machine's espresso holder that well and it's hard to get the pressure right because this is so lightweight. I went to cash and Cary and bought a heavier, tear drop handled one like the coffee shops use and am much happier with that. Also, because of the alloy this is made of, it now has weird 'salt spots' from my dishwasher soap. It had some kind of weird reaction. It's still usable, but looks dirty forever."
5,A tamper is definitely necessary,"I received the Mr. Coffee ECM-160 4-Cup Steam Espresso Machine [...] for Christmas this year. I have really been enjoying it! However, I was reading reviews online, and so many people suggested getting an espresso tamper. Being that I am very new to brewing my own espresso (used to reeeaaally frequent the starbucks), I was a little skeptical. I was pretty content just using the flat side of the tablespoon that came with the machine since it SEEMED to build pressure just fine. Then I received an Amazon gift card and thought I should give this tamper a try since it was so inexpensive.This morning was the first time I used it and it makes SUCH a difference. I can actually fit 4 TBS of espresso for 4 cups of espresso! It creates a sort of ""puck"" of espresso. You can see a big difference before you even start brewing, but then you can taste a big difference too. It is definitely worth getting if your espresso machine did not come with one!"
5,Perfect,"Needed a substantial tamper to follow the show 'Good Eats"" method of 50 lbs. tamper pressure (which I found improves the brew remarkably) and this item is perfect. The larger end serves to spread the pressure on the hand while the other end fits my Delongie maker perfectly. Will order two more for friends."
4,It does its job,"It's not the best tamper I've ever used, but it was cheap! I'd say go for it if you're on a budget. If not, you can find better."
3,Tamper not worth the money,"The tamper is nice and heavy duty but I don't see that it is an improvement over the plastic one that came with my Espresso machine. If you don't have a tamper, it is a good one."
2,Dishwasher ruined it.,"Okay, it tampers fine. But I ran it in the dishwasher once and now all the shine is gone, even though it said dishwasher safe. I don't recommend to buy it."
2,"Works as a tamper, but finish is terrible","This tamper does work just fine as a tamper, however, when you put it in the dishwasher, do not expect it to be shiny when it comes out. It seems the finish completely dulls or the top finish came off after running through the dishwasher. It still works as a tamper, however, it looks pretty bad after just one cycle in the dishwasher, which is not acceptable for an item that says dishwasher safe. I wish the product would have just said hand wash only. I would not recommend this."
2,Dishwasher safe?,"I recently purchased this tamper and ran it through the dishwasher. It came out extremely tarnished and I'm not sure exactly what to do with it now. My hands turn silver when I touch it, so I'm definitely not using it to press espresso."
3,u get what u paid for,Very light and not quiet upto the mark. The joints visible in the stamper stem.Not sure how long its' gonna last
3,It's ok..,I bought it to work with Mr. Coffee Espresso Maker ECM 160. It doesn't fit perfectly but I already knew it from reading reviews before I bought it. The reason why I took two stars away is I found the surface to be uneven with spots.
1,Should have read the reviews- not dishwasher safe,"I have yet to actually use my tamper- so can not comment on if it even does a good job at that. My complaint about the product is that it is not dishwasher safe. This would be fine, if it didn't say right no the tag ""Dishwasher Safe"". So prior to using for the first time I threw it in the dishwasher to get it clean. Unfortunately now it's all grimy and gross and unusable. I will now have to throw it away and buy a new one."
1,NOT DISHWASHER SAFE,It Fits It works It's Not DishWasher Safe. I ran it through the dishwasher and it came out looking nasty so i used bonami to clean it up. shavings were coming off of it before that
4,RSVP Terry Tamper,"I wanted a solid, no frills tamp that had two sizes common to most espresso makers' group size. I had ordered a machine without knowing the size. Well, the 58 mm end worked out fine. This medium heavy unit feels right- solid and heavy. Does the job right, but won't win fashion design or beauty contests. This was exactly what I needed."
2,Not dishwasher safe!,The product description states the item is dishwasher safe. This is simply not true. After one cycle in the dishwasher the damper outside metal washed off and was stained. That being said I was pleased with the tamper until I washed it in the dishwasher.If you are purchasing this tamper make sure to only hand wash the item.
4,good product but amazon's recommendation messed up,"This product has decent quality. However, Amazon messes up by recommending it with ""Mr. Coffee ECM160 4-Cup Steam Espresso Machine."" This tamper is probably 1-2mm bigger for that espresso machine. Try something else (49mm ones)."
2,Wow Terry.,"Not sure if Terry has ever been a barista, even though Terry's Tamper lays it's claim to have been devolped by Baristas. As a Barista, I would have to rank the tamper at a ""D"". Here are the issues:1.It does not quite fit the machine Amazone recomends for it.2. It is not very heavy and seems to be made cheaply from a mold(?)If the tamper was used with a bigger machine it may fit. In regards of weight... maybe it is personal preference but the tamper does not carry a good amount of weight."
5,One purpose done well and inexpensively,"I needed something flat and cheap to tamp coffee. You don't do better than this for the price. I don't have an espresso machine but rather a Krups Moka Brew (highly recommend that as well) and it is suggested that you tamp the grinds for the style of coffee maker that it is. This works perfectly for the task at hand.I'm a little perplexed at the high priced tampers for sale out there. I mean, really, it's a flat surface that you apply pressure to. Duh. Save money and buy this product."
3,"Great Tamper, but too large for my Pavoni","I wish the information along with the photo had included a diameter. This is a well balanced, well made espresso tamper, but too large for my Pavoni Machine. I'll keep it in the drawer (it does make a cool paperweight), but keep looking for a smaller one. ciao..........."
4,A Must,"This tamper is a wee bit small for me but it has greatly improved my pulls! With enough tamping pressure, the coffee is actually sweet!"
4,Tamper Works,"This was an unnecessary but fortuitous purchase. The expresso machine I bought at the same time came with a plastic tamper (not mentioned in the description). However, I have used both and like this much better. It is light weight alloy but very solid and comfortable to hold and use. The diameter is slightly smaller than the diameter of my coffee holder, but it works much better and faster than the plastic one. I have ditched the plastic one!"
3,Acceptable,"I ordered this because I was cheap and wanted a strong tamper that fit two sizes of machine. It does that, but it feels light and cheap in the hand. I don't like using the other tamping base in my palm and wish I had just purchased a better feeling tamper because I don't use this anymore. Does the job, though."
4,terry's tamper,works well except it is a little too big to get the proper result for my particular machine......i need a smaller diameter head to get better results
4,Just right,Perfect fit for either size filter and works like expected. Quality is good and I would buy another if needed.
2,Espresso tamper,This press did not fit in the basket when pressing for 2cups. It bound on the side of the basket.
5,an indispensable gadget to make espresso coffee,"very good, an indispensable gadget to make espresso and cappuccino coffee,, surely recommended, very useful(words still not enough,bala,bala,bala,bala,bala)"
4,One solid piece of aluminum.,"Works as advertised. Garaunteed not to rust, bust, or collect dust, and it will never sag in the middle. Batteries NEVER need replacing!"
4,Tamper,"I use this Espresso Tamper every morning. I start my day with a Latte and found that the tamper connected to my machine to be very unhandy and not give me a consistent tamp. One can purchase much more expensive and fancier tampers, but this one works very well. I can not imagine needing a fancier one other than just the esthetics of it. This works and looks good."
5,"It's a simple, good, cheap tamper","It's light for its size, has two ends so that it should fit in your large or small puck, doesn't rust, and it's only $6. What else is there to desire from a tamper?"
2,NOT the size it says in the description.,"I measure one end as 1 7/8"", which might be good enough for a 2"" filter. However, I was hoping a 2"" tamper would be good enough for my newDeLonghi EC155 Espresso Maker, which has a 53mm filter - about 2 1/8"" - so the misleading description made a significant difference. This is NOT the best tamper for that machine - look for a 53mm one (I'm still looking for a reasonably priced one.)"
3,Great price. Not perfect,"I appreciate having this tamper as an option. I can't understand why all the other options have to be so expensive for such a simple thing.My only issue with the thing is that the tamping end was slightly too large for my espresso basket, which is a very standard size for inexpensive espresso makers. It fit fine at the top of the basket, but I typically only make 2 shots at a time, and the basket has a bit of taper to it. My machine is the Mr Coffee one you can get at WalMart for $35.I turned the tamper on my grinder to make it a littly smaller and it works fine now."
2,It's not dishwasher safe!,"Great item, does what it's supposed to do, however, I washed it in the dishwasher and the shiny metal plating washed off completely! Hand washing is recommended."
4,Casting Issues But Overall a Nifty Tool,"The tamper I received wasn't finished properly and the ridges from it's casting prevent it from being of use until filed off. Not that big a deal for me personally but it might be for someone else.With rough edges filed off, this fits my Krups espresso machine perfectly.As mentioned by other reviewers, THIS IS NOT DISHWASHER SAFE even though it states it is on the tag and on this page. Dishwasher detergent and aluminum items do not like each other. Aluminum will corrode very rapidly. It doesn't take much to clean by hand anyway. As a side note, never put cast iron items in your dishwasher either, they will rust heavily immediately."
1,HAPPY CUSTOMER,"THIS ITEM IS NOT SUITABLE FOR MY DELONGHI EC 702 ESPRESSO MACHINE. EVEN THOUGH, IT IS ADVERTISED AS 50 MM; IT IS MORE LIKELY LIKE 49 MM."
5,awesome,"I'm trying to figure out why people buy the $99 dollar tamper when these work just as well. Simple, and easy. Some coffee stuff is overrated. It does not look like a $99 one but there is no coffee competition going on!"
3,"Does the job, but do NOT put in the dishwasher","So I really liked this until I put it in the dishwasher. It got all dingy looking and has a strange feel to it now, but it does still work. I don't even know why I put it in the dishwasher. It's one of those things that just needs to be brushed off or rinsed off at the most. I bought it to go with the DeLonghi BAR32 Retro Pump-Driven 35 ounce Espresso Maker, and it fits fine."
1,worthless,"I never got to use it. An initial run through the dishwasher removed the chrome-like surface, revealing a dull colored metal core. Just touching it would leave a dark residue on your fingers. I would not allow this to touch coffee grounds."
1,Useless,"I ordered this when buying a Delongui espresso machine ONLY because Amazon suggested it, and I must say I wasted my money! You do NOT need this because the coffee machine already has an integrated tamper and you do NOT need to press coffee that hard for it to brew.I know its my mistake for not being well informed but I still wouldn't buy one of these."
1,cant review because never delivered,I ordered this product on Dec 29th for Jan 6th delivery. Never came. Called and they said it would be here Jan 13th. Never came. Called and they then said I would have to cancel and reorder something different. Horrible experience
1,Don't waste your money.,Spend the money and get a decent one. This one isn't worth the cost or the shipping.
5,Espresso Tamper - Simple and effective,"This 50/60 mm espresso tamper is a nice extra to have in making espressos. My machine came with a built-in tamper, but using it a bit messy. This easy-to-clean tamper is much quicker and more effective at getting a good tamping. Thumbs up!"
3,If you couldn't tell it's cheap!!!,"It's very cheap, but it does the job and since it's the closes size to my machine I had to get it. Still not a perfect fit but good enough I guess"
1,FAIL,"The description says: ""heavy cast metal alloy is dishwasher safe."" Do NOT put it in the dishwasher.The metal literally washes off, and it becomes completely unusable.Contains tin, aluminum, zinc...not metals you want touching your food."
1,"""Heavy cast metal"" is NOT Stainless Steel!","Others have noted that this item discolors in the dishwasher. The reason for this is that the ""heavy cast metal"" is not Stainless Steel but ""pot metal."" There is no scientific metallurgical standard for pot metal; common metals in pot metal include zinc, lead, copper, tin, magnesium, aluminium, iron, and cadmium. Many of these metals will react with the very hot alkaline water in a dishwasher; the reason they discolor is that some of the metal has been dissolved. Since the manufacturer does not state which metals are used, and my opinion is that it is best to avoid possible exposure to lead, tin and cadmium, I would not use this product for beverage production."
2,It tamps fine after 45 mins of modification,The tampers large side was just slightly to large and the small size was too small for Krupps Model 964 espresso machine.I used my shop bench grinder to grind large side down until it fit perfectly. This thing should cost two dollars.I am thankful that I now have a tamper that works well for less than ten bucks.
3,Its pretty big!,"I bought this product along with a espresso machine that actually came with one ( I didn't know that at the time) but, This tamper is pretty big to me! Its probably the normal size one (50 MM) Just kinda big ( thick wise) AND its stainless steel! ALWAYS a plus when working with coffee!"
1,"Disappointed - Lightweight, chintzy","I haven't used mine yet because I will probably be returning it. When it got here, I was very disappointed. It's described as ""heavy cast metal."" Maybe the cast was heavy, but the metal is definitely not. It's very lightweight, seems like it's very cheaply made. It's honestly not all that much better than the crappy plastic tamper that came with my machine. If you're looking to upgrade your tamper, I would look elsewhere."
1,Works,It works alright for the price. It is too light and rough craftsmanship. Using the bottom of a shut cup or anything with the same diameter would do the same job. Just another piece of kitchen junk lying around in the drawer.
4,It's a necessary tool...,"It's a necessary tool to get a better espresso, but the price is very high by adding the taxes I sent in my country, I think for small products and low cost is not very convenient to buy online."
5,Awesome!,This tamper is excellent and does the job quickly and efficiently. On some of the reviews there was mention that it didn't fix the cup correctly and I almost didn't buy it. I'm glad I did because it works beautifully.
5,Works perfect,Been using with my Delonghi EC155 and works well even thought the basket size is 53mm. Handles real good. Nice purchase.
4,Good for the money,"I know there are nicer tampers out there, but this tamper has worked great for me for such a low price. It is a little harder to handle than some of the nicer ones would be, but as long as you are careful to keep is level it should work just fine :)"
4,Works just fine.,"First tamper I have bought so, can't compare. Some coffee sticks to it. Don't know if one can get one where that doesn't happen."
2,Wrong Diameter,"In expensive and well built. However, while advertised as a 60 mm tamper, the actual diameter of the larger head is a little under 54 mm (measured with precision electronic device), resulting in non-homogeneously tamped ground, and poor quality espresso."
1,Extremely disappointed,"I was excited when I received my espresso tamper as it fits perfectly. However, when I washed it the first time, it turned dark gray and the powder rubs off on your hands! No where in the description or in any paperwork (none in shipment) did it specify that this must be handwashed. It's so nasty looking that I don't even want to use it. What a ripoff!I gave it one star - but only because the site requires something in this field. It should be taken off the market."
3,"For the price, it works!","At it's price point, it does what it's expected to do. I'd rather a heftier tamper with a proper handle. If I recall correctly the casting of the tamper left a small bump running the diameter of the circle."
5,"Excellent Tamper, Great price!",There are some mixed reviews on this tamper but it looked to me like it would do the job at a good price. I just received it a couple of days ago but it seems to work great. It smaller end fits perfectly in my grounds basket (we have a Starbucks Barista espresso maker). It really seems to make a difference using the Tamper rather than my fingers to tamp. The shots have been perfect. Really can't beat the price on this one...while shopping around for a tamper I saw quite a variance in pricing. I never imagined a coffee tamper would be so expensive. This one is a great bargain!Cons: The only con I can think of is that it is made of aluminum. Stainless would be nicer but that would drive the price up a bit.
4,"Gets the job done, looks cool","The tamper is of a different size on each side. The smaller side fits just right into my Breville 800ESXL. It's definitely an upgrade from the plastic one included with the machine (which is not even a separate piece; it's the back of the dosifier spoon).Some reviewers claim it's cheap and ""you get what you pay for"". I can't tell about more expensive tampers; this is the first actual tamper I own (after 10 years and 3 machines pulling espressos at home) and though I can tell some other models look more ""fine/expensive"", this one fits well in my portafilter and looks cool next to the all stainless steel setup. I was just going to buy the BCG450XL Conical Burr Grinder, but Amazon ""suggested"" the tamper, and I fell for it. I'm glad I did."
1,Do not buy.....,"This is a cheap poorly made tamper. You get what you pay for! Save your money and use the plastic tamper that you get with any espresso machine. But you do want to upgrade, I would only recommend a Reg Barber tamper (solid stainless steel base)."
4,"does the job, affordable","I use this on my Krups Il Primo, and it works great. Be sure to see the youtube video on getting nice espresso from this if you use the Il Primo - I didn't know about letting the steam out the stem FIRST. Tamping seems to make a difference. Good price, fast delivery."
3,Okay if you want a cheap solution.,"I actually bought this based off of the five star review on here. Nothing against that person's review. They were right for the most part, but the quality just was not up to my expectations. It's glaringly apparent it is some aftermarket product and the texture doesn't match my 01 Taurus's dash. Search elsewhere and you'll hear about it's cheap feel. It's easy enough to install and serves its purpose, but don't think you're getting anything special just because it comes with that ""nifty"" cd slot. You do get all the speaker cable you will EVER need (not that it matched my Taurus anyway). But seriously, if you can wait save for something else. The overall quality of this thing is NOT that good. It's doable, but you can definitely do better."
4,Fit dash,Overall happy with ICP Kit. Plastic could be better in quality but serves its purpose so I cant knock it to much.
3,"Does the job, definitely not OEM quality","The difference in materials between this and the rest of the dash is noticeable. The little plastic piece that sits around the deck tends to move very easily, ruining the flush design that it is supposed to have."
5,a backwoods bob dylan. seriously.,"Jaded music fan that I am, not many new recordings stop me in my tracks like they used to. And I guess I'm a serious snob now because the music that does impress me is hopelessly obscure - so overlooked I'm amazed I even found it. Which brings me to Graham Lindsey.This record does owe a bit of a debt to early Bob Dylan (one song,Dead Man's Waltz is pretty much To Ramona with different lyrics) but Lindsey still manages to offer something entirely his own. Besides, Bob Dylan hasn't sounded like early Bob Dylan for 40 years - somebody ought to. And he does indeed have his own voice.In any case, this album is one of the best I've heard in several years. Here's hoping Graham Lindsey comes out with a new record soon and finds a label that can do a little more promotion than the one that put this one out.Shameless self promotion: exileonhicksDOTblogspotDOTcom for my music bloggy thing."
3,"Some great riffs and guitar, a few good songs","Great to see this album from great guitarist, session player and man with his own timing and style. Your Love is fantastic, especially the solo. Deeper Shades of Blues is strong traditional blues, Assault and Battery is pounding instrumental and some other very good songs. Some bad ones too. Not his strongest, but boy can he fly!. Try other albums, very strong performer."
1,doomed by another line up change,"basically we have mediocre musicianship and HORRIBLE vocals. dont get me wrong, the black/death vocals are fine....but the whispering in ""so called savior"" drains every ounce of power and credibility out of this track; just when you think, ok, it cant get any worse.....the spoken word vocals hit you. i didnt know it was possible to mess up spoken word parts, but ive been proven wrong. dark requiems (and previous to that)are really good albums. dark requiems is one of my favorites. jon's vocal delivery and variations help make dark... an incredible black metal masterpiece...."
2,My bike was stolen with this lock,"Okay for small town use, but not for a big city where bike theft is the #1 crime. I got my crappy Magna bike stolen in the 'nicest' neighborhood that was locked up on my friend's front porch."
5,Plenty of great pics,"a great guide, plenty of pics. One of the best overview guide books I have seen. I bought both the national and state version of this book."
4,"National Geographic Guide to the National Parks of the United States, 5th Ed. (National Geographic Guide to the National Parks o","This is an excellent reference and is a good guide to points of interest and gives enough information to research each National Park represented.The book doesn't cover every Park , but those that it does it does well.An excellent reference."
3,Useful UNIX book,Has been useful. Maybe if I had read this before reading many other UNIX books I would be able to give more stars. Worth the money.
4,covers wide range of topics fairly well,"I think the book cover a wide range of topics fairly well but I had a probelm figuring out the level of user the book was intended for, the audience of the book was not clear.I got a lot of good information but I also found quite a few mistakes and I even went back the the book store to see if a Third edition of the book was out"
1,Quality is better than quantity,"So many dvds, so much bleh material. Either im giving this away or its going into the trash."
1,These guys rool!,I haven't heard such originality or heavyness since Sabbath and Dio! You gotta get this throwback now or you won't be cool!
3,Fun book but a little odd,"I liked the book, kids get a kick out of it! The stories are definitely odd and don't really make sense, not that a children's book needs to be 100% clear, they are in fact better when extra sillyness occurs, but there isn't a lot of continuity to the different stories. Perhaps better for older kids."
3,One of Craig Thomas' better books...,"One of Craig Thomas' better books with, compared with his other recent releases. It is not too far fetched and set in Burma which is quite interesting. I'd recommend the Firefox books and Winter Hawk to start though, if you have not read his other books."
4,High on a cloud...,"If you want to buy one album of the Pandoras, this is it.This f****d up puck/go go/girl band/beach music will take you on a joy ride!"
1,High on a Cloud,"The song High on a Cloud is the best song on the album. They didn't write it, and had alot of nerve doing it. The writer and singer was Mike Carroll from the 60's Garage band The Traits. Hear the real version, it's so much better!"
1,I agree with the MF from Long Beach...,"These girls were terrible. I saw them in LA circa 1985. Paula could'nt carry a tune let alone tune her guitar. And for the rest of the band, they reminded me of Danny Partridge. Their instruments were just to big for them."
5,Marie Antoinette~ the maturing of a Queen,"This is a wonderful movie about a young girl who develops into a Queen; the self absorbed teen becomes politically aware & strong willed; the choices she makes creates lasting History! I am so intrigued by Marie Antoinette, the last Queen of France~ this is a fantastic summary of her life. Beautiful & Tragic! I highly recommend this movie for anyone who loves all things French:)"
4,Bit noisy,"The unit is a bit noisy on high, but I sleep fine with it on low and a couple of feet from my bed. Seems to do a very good job of getting moisture into the air even with the fan on low. The casters allow for easy movement, and the twin tanks are small enough to handle easily even when full."
4,Great humidifier!,I like this purifier much more than I thought I would! It's quiet and it easily humidifies our 1400 sq ft condo. I fill it up once or twice a day and use the protec cartridge as instructed. This is definitely a cost effective solution with minimal upkeep when using the protec filters and cartidges.
1,"Why is it called ""Quiet""Care???","Honeywell should not be allowed to call this product by any name with the word ""quiet"" in it. The fan motor itself is quiet, but when the fan turns on every cheap plastic part rattles against every adjacent cheap plastic part and believe me it is load and annoying. I have tried gluing/taping the pieces to eliminate the rattling. The tape works for awhile, but after a day or two the vibrations loosen the tape's hold enough that the rattling comes back. Not a quality product.As a humidifier it is decent, but not good. Also, note that ""11 gallon"" capacity does not mean that the reservoir holds 11 gallons, so it needs frequent refilling."
2,Designed by idiots. WOULD NEVER BUY AGAIN!,"Admittedly, the humidifying part of this device works fine. On the other hand ""QuietCare"" is a joke, I've flown single-engine airplanes that were not a loud as this thing. The worst part of it is an engineering problem. It is impossible to stand the tanks upright to fill them. They have to be hand-supported like drunken sailors during the filling up process. What kind of idiot designs something like that only to make it look ""good""? Shame on Honewell's engineering and design department!"
3,Has some design flaws,"Humidifier works fairly well but has a tendency to shut off in the night because the water has stopped draining from the tanks into the machine. If you adjust the water tanks it will start working again, but who wants to be constantly adjusting the water tanks. I probably wouldn't purchase this item again."
3,Okay product,"My home is very dry without a humidifier. When my old one died last spring I decided to replace it with the HCM-6011i. It does a good job humidifying the air, but the tanks are rather small and need to be filled much more often than my prior one. One really annoying aspect is that the tanks dont seem to seat properly and drain all the way. When the unit indicates it is out of water I can often jostle the tanks and one will still have a lot of water left that it just did not dispense for some reason."
2,Less than happy,"I did have to tighten up the screws that hold the fan assy together to get rid of an annoying buzzing noise. Other than that I like it. I think the complaints about having to hold the tanks while filling because the top is not flat are blown out of proportion.EditAfter using this for a couple of seasons now, my appreciation has diminished considerably due to the ever present buzzing noise this thing generates. It still does the job, but the noise issue has become a major irritation. I have worked on the thing to try to remove or reduce the noise to no avail. This will be it's last season with me."
2,Definitely could be better,"D. Wardlow is absolutely right. I couldn't have said it better.Very difficult to turn water tank after filling and not having a flat surface to stand on....besides unless you have a utility water basin, you would probably have to use the bath tub to fill the large tank. Then it's really difficult.I tested about how long before needing a filling and it was completely bone dry in 2 nights (16 hrs). The shutoff valve never shut off when empty.Be careful to buy this unit if you have any back problems because your not going to have fun filling tank every night."
1,Where is the humidity?,"Honeywell HCM-6011i QuietCare 11-Gallon Console Humidifier with Air Washing TechnologyWe are running constantly this humidifier with very little change in humidity. I need humidity to run a garment printer, and this is just not doing it."
4,Great Product,"I'm enjoying this humidifier. It was bigger than I thought it would be, but I found a space perfect for it. I don't have anything else to compare it to, but it does what it should. I keep it in the bedroom and turn it on a few hours before turning in. I definately feel the difference in the room. The sound is quiet and soothing. Once in a while it will vibrate, but I just bump it or reposition the cover and it's good to go again."
3,One more caution,"Yes, this unit isn't that great, but I needed a humidifier and couldn't find anything better after a long search. I have found one more problem for users: the handle on each tank is only cemented on and can separate if you carry a filled tank by the handle. When this happened to me the tank fell to the ground, broke into many pieces, and a gallon of water was on the floor. However, according to Kaz, this is NOT a warranty defect because the handle was not designed to carry a full tank of water! It should always be supported from below. A replacement tank is about $28."
4,The first that actually does its job!,"For health reasons, I need to humidify my apartment to 50-60% RH. In the last two months, I have bought 7 humidifiers, returning most of them because they did not do the job. I've got huge ceilings and spacious rooms. This is the first humidifier that actually did the job! In fact it over did it. Because this model does not have a built in humidistat, I woke up to a humidity level at 71%! I'm still trying to figure out how to set it right, so I don't over do it! I would recommend buying the one with the humidistat, but this one does me just fine."
4,Pretty good!,"This is a nice unit that keeps my house at 50% humidity on a once-a-day fillup. Some complain about the noise, but look....it sounds like a fan. It IS a fan, plus a wet rag, basically, that's what a humidifier IS. So it's quiet on low, tolerable on medium speed, and on high speed...it sounds as loud as a fan on high speed. No surprises, no problems.My only complaint is the clumsiness of refilling the two tanks. When the tanks are inverted and placed under your bathtub spout, they want to tip over because of the 'swoopy' handles. So you have to awkwardly hold the tanks as they fill, and try not to drop them as you hold them with one hand and screw the lid back on. Stupid swoopy handles!UPDATE 1/27/09 - Stupid swoopy handles! One of the tanks slipped in the tub and cracked itself. It leaks, but fortunately it leaks into the reservoir. I'll try to patch it with superglue. Very poorly designed!"
1,read description carefully!,"The ""11 gallon daily output"" is only possible if you fill it THREE TIMES A DAY - the two tanks hold 3.25 gallons total. That is a ridiculous piece of marketing. Also very annoying you can't see the water level in the tanks unless you lift it out of the humidifier. Finally, it's very tough to fill the tanks, because you have to put the handle side down to screw the top back on - but the handle side has isn't a flat surface. It has the usual problems of constantly needing new filters, but that is common to most inexpensive humidifiers. If you want a really easy to care for humidifier get a Venta Airwasher, but they are really expensive...After several months, it's just as bad: sometimes the water tanks don't connect quite right with the base so the water doesn't drain - so it will shut off in the middle of the night when it runs out of water.Also now both tanks have cracks in them.I'm definitely throwing it out in a few weeks once Spring weather is here."
1,I can't believe anyone would like this humidifier,I bought one of these. I plugged it in and nothing happened! I called customer service at Kaz Incorporated. They sent me a new unit only after I had to mail them the water tanks. The new unit worked for FOUR days. Now they are paying for me to return this unit and are sending a third humidifier. I would rather get my money back!
3,Design and Instructions need amending,"I bought one unit and returned it when it became undependable about running. The second unit had the same problems.1) Unit's lights go out if water level in bottom pan gets too low signifying water needs to be added. The unit's trouble shooter manual doesn't identify this ""operating"" feature but instead refers you to other problems. This item was further confused by a poorly designed base unit. (see below)2) Plastic bumps in unit base that press against water bottle stoppers are not high enough. The unit would frequently quit running long before water level in bottles was out. I placed 1/2"" copper plumbing caps (with 1/8"" cut off their ends) on top of those ""bumps"" and now the unit runs until the water is truly exhausted.3) blower unit must be set exactly in place on base or float will fail to operate properly and unit won't run.Other than these ""flaws"" the unit performs well and looks good.After the unit was modified, I could re-rate it at a 4-star."
3,good but,"I have a love hate relationship with this humidifier. On the love side, it really gets the humidity up in my bedroom fast - on anything but the lowest setting. Even on low, it will eventually cycle as long as my heat isn't constantly on. So this is good.The split water sections are also very nice however this is curse part as well. While the split does allow me to easily fill the sections with water and carry them in - if they aren't sitting 100% perfect the humidifier will start to sound like a model plane taking off. What's worse, even if you think that everything is fit together, occasionally, when the device cycles from off to on, you may no longer have the seating correctly and you could be woken up by...the sound of a model plane taking off.Overall I'm torn on this humidifier. The pluses - fast hydration, easy operation - are countered by the occasional sound of take off."
5,"Excellent, but you shouldn't stop here.","This is a terrific book for any Michael Landon fan who wants to know the more personal side and home life of the man. But if you truly want to know all sides of him, there are other books out there that show a more unbiased look you should read as well. You have to keep in mind that this comes from a grieving daughter who is still bitter over his divorce from her mother. Although there's no doubt that she loved him dearly, being an actual step-daughter, it's obvious that she took her mother's side in the divorce. There are always two sides to any dispute. I'm not saying he did nothing wrong. But she conveniently leaves his side out, not only about the divorce, but about how unfair she makes his will seem. After reading several other books on Michael Landon, the whole picture comes more clearly into view. Over all, I would still strongly recommend this book, but it shouldn't stand alone."
3,A promise,This book was more about Cheryl than it was Michael. that is why I gave it 3 stars. it does have some interesting reading about the Landon family. it was not a bad book but just not what I expected I wanted to read more about Michael and his life. an ok read.
1,"Hang your head low, Cheryl","Years before his death, in an interview, Michael Landon stated that, his greatest heartbreak would be that, after his death, one of his kids write one of those ""tell all"" trashy books.Cheryl Pontrelli, you have succeeded in doing the one thing your step-father feared. You ruined his reputation and put him among those stars who have had a trash book written about them. I hope you have since squandered the profits from this book and are working at a supermarket reading the tabloids during your lunch break."
4,For Better or Worse...,"I enjoyed this book very much, I felt it was well written and gutsy. Michael Landon's stepdaughter describes her father in a way that surprised me, as a human being with faults and weaknesses the same as anyone else. She didn't describe him as this wonderful, larger-than-life megastar that only had time for his work. It was humbling to know his origins, his heartaches, his humiliations growing up as a Jewish person when that wasn't the most popular thing to be. The story of his overcoming all the obstacles was heartening and enlightening, and I finally saw him as just a person, a father, husband, friend, son, brother; not just the Pa I dreamed of having on Little House, and not necessarily as angelic as Jonathan on Highway to Heaven. It is well worth the reading, and I recommend it to anyone who is/was a fan of Michael Landon."
1,Misinformation from seller,"Seller advertised as ""new."" DVD clearly was used - of course it came in sealed plastic wrap, but the under/playing surface of the DVD shows obvious wear. I contacted seller and their immediate and only response has been denial. Sad. Seller is on my ""avoid"" list moving forward."
4,"Very nice shirt, True to color.","Nice shirt, Well made. good sizing. Nice color. Will need ironing. He wore it for our wedding reception. He looked great."
3,PUNK History,"It is as much interesting as any shorts of currently occurred might be to descendants in decades oncoming.Personally, I hardly associate the rarely seen concert performing of clean shaved white-shirt clad grown-up noisy blocks with classic punk images to date."
5,This is a heartrending story well worth reading.,"While I have found Rudy Wiebe's more recent writing difficult to get into I couldn't put this book down. Yvonne's story is horrendous, almost unbelievable except that it comes through in such a way that the reader is convinced that she really has experienced her life as she and Wiebe have written it. I feel saddened and inspired to do more to understand and support our fellow native Canadians. Yvonne and Rudy, thank you for this book."
3,pretty good,"I place this CD in the lower half of the CDs by musette. It has some good songs, notably White Gate, but unlike most of musette's CDs this CD contains several songs that do not stay with you after hearing them. If you are a musettethen it is worth buying - I certainly am glad I bought it. Otherwise, start with some of her other CDs, like Doll and Full Moon and the Shrine"
1,Please try again,"This album doesn't have the varied 'feel' of the music--it's too mechanical, not enough atmosphere. If you are looking for Paris musette songs, get something else that has the original artists' recordings."
2,More name than non-stick covering,"We have had this pan for 5 yrs. Within the first 2 yrs, it warped. We wash by hand, use medium, never high, heat, and use the 400 degree capable plastic utensils. The pan is not flat now, so I cannot cook our food evenly with our flat cooktop stove. Also, the non-stick is coming off. Maybe ours is faulty, but I won't ever buy their non-stick again."
2,New meaning of nonstick of which I was not previously aware,"The coating is strong, but textured, and not non-stick. These pans are designed to sear meat, or to cook sauces.While the size and shape looks perfect for small to medium stir-fry, do not be misled; you will soak and scrub this pan like an unseasoned iron skillet.High-heat on soft foods will definitely cook the food onto the pan. Granted, splashes on the sides, and small spots do clean up easily, but things that burn or encrust on the bottom are tough to remove.Luckily, the coating is very durable and scrubby-pads and metal spatulas can be used on them."
4,Tritium sights - Desert Eagle .357 Magnum,I had the standard 'battle sights' on my Desert Eagle. The millet sights are only $80 or so bucks but I really didn't like the way the looked. These sights are a lot like the standard sights but with the additional glowing dots. They are very easy to install...took about 10 mins. They line up and are quick on target...unlike the target millet type.Except for the price...these are great. They need to be south of a $100 to be great...
1,Don't trust fitment info,Sandwich engine oil adapter does not come with 20MM bolt needed to fit Japanese cars like 350Z. Other less expensive kits include all five adapter bolts you would need. The stock filter will not work with the adapter because of insufficient outer diameter to seal the indentations caused by the installation of the thermal bypass spring in the adapter. Unless you love surprises and throwing good money after bad to overcome the short -comings of this kit don't buy it!
2,Great disappointment,Beware...product is NOT compatible with all the vehicles they claim. Set up was fairly easy...just wish it fit our vehicle.
5,Haden coolers,Installed both the heavy duty tranmission & engine oil coolers. The results were so good that they surpassed even the claims of the manufacturer. We measured before and after installation temps and we consistently achieve a 30-40 degree drop in engine operating temp.
4,Exploring the definition of humanity,"I originally met most of the diseases covered in this book during medical school. I found my academic knowledge of these disorders matured into a much greater understanding with the help of the history and personal stories provided by Leroi. Mutants is well-written, entertaining, and well-cited. The scientific and medical information is well presented and explained in a way that should be understandable to lay people but is not obnoxious to those more familiar with the subjects. Leroi brings to light the interplay between genetics and society, how we define humanity and normality. I was surprised to learn from many of the personal stories that people suffering from incredibly rare and often debilitating or stigmatizing diseases lived normal or even charmed lives during many times in the past. I wonder today if we do too much categorizing, if we try too hard to make every person live up to an arbitrary standard of humanity."
5,compelling,Wow! This book is erudite AND compelling; it's a fascinating delve into history you haven't read before combined with an explanation of the lastest science. It's got enough up to date genetics for a bio-chem PhD yet accessible to someone who hasn't studied biology since high-shcool. Is it the subject a bit too much for the squeamish? Not at all: Dr. Leroi treats the subjects of his book with sufficient respect so that you will overcome any squeamishness you may initially feel as you learn more about the variety of shapes we humans come in.
5,Great Book,"This was an excellent, if disturbing, book. It was informative and morbidly interesting to read. At some points, it got dryly scientific, and if you don't know anything about biology or genetics, you may end up spending time doing side research. A great insight into not only what can happen to us inside the womb, but a good insight into our historical views of what it once meant to be a ""Mutant"". Fascinating."
4,Fascinating read,"Armand Marie Leroi has written a book about all those people we fight not to stare at, in a tasteful, intriguing way that brings context to mutants beyond physical deformity. This book delivers everything it promises in a quick, 356 page package and I highly recommend it.I was surprised to find out that I'm a mutant! The short section on red-headedness was a pleasant surprise.The one quibble I had with this book is that it sometimes falls prey to being a little heavy on the science--FGF signalling, etc--that I found a little distracting and skipped over once or twice. For science junkies, this will be a boon. Little much at a couple small sections for this reader."
3,Human genetic variety,There is more text then pictures. The book is written in a more clinical nature vs. as an oddity book.
3,A Smart Writer But Not One That Knows How To Entertain,A great writer that is smart but he doesn't keep you reading;so if you get bored easily you will abondone this one.
4,Almost Perfect,"After picking up an incredible CD titled ""The Blues: Language of New Orleans Vol. 3"" on my last trip to New Orleans, I decided to try a CD which was a compilation of all the music which can be found in my favorite city. I found most of this CD absolutely wonderful - particularly outstanding is Luther Kent's Ice House Blues, School of Hard Knocks by Timothea and Astronaut Pit by Voodoo Groove. The only drawback of the CD I have is there are two tracks which I continuously skip over- Rick Tobey's Karen which is a New Age piece and a strange Grunge-y song called Whirlwind Psycho. Neither types of music is of my taste; but that is just my own personal preference. However if you want a CD which sums up the diverse and exotic sound of New Orleans this CD is a must have."
5,The Adventures of Prince Achmed,"I first saw this film on TCM and was blown away by it's beauty. It was created by a woman in the 1920s and is one of the most beautiful ""animated"" films I've ever seen. It was created by using articulated paper cuts as the scenery and players. A timeless beauty and a must have for any serious film collector. Both the visual film quality and the beautiful musical sound track were carefully restored in this version. It is one I will always cherish."
4,Make This DVD Available Again!!!,"This film is quite visually wonderful to behold; I wish I'd found the film sooner. Imaginative, with gorgeous design work, this is a beautiful work of art. The sequence people often talk about is the one where the princess and her handmaidens are taking a bath in a pool, and you see the ripples of water around them. When you stop to remember that those ripples are just little bits of cardboard bobbing around on a light table, your jaw drops even further, and it's just a little throwaway scene! Amazing animation work with limited resources. The one and only complaint I have is that the DVD is now out of circulation, on moratorium. Which is why all the prices for it here on Amazon are high up in orbit. Please, somebody, get this into circulation again so we don't have to sell our firstborn children to afford a copy!"
5,Classic,"This is one of the most interesting animated films I've seen. The sillouhettes (sp?) are remarkable against the color tinted backgrounds. The plot has many twists and turns, but the viewer never gets lost in the plot. It will have you intrigued from the beginning right to the end.This is a retelling of ""The Arabian Nights."" The animation is much smoother than that of some stop motion animation (ie the Rankin-Bass holiday programs). If you are a fan of ""The Arabian Nights"" or ""Aladdin"" (the Aladdin story is also told in this feature), then this movie is for you."
4,This book is so inspiring,"This book is great to help those deal with their sexual identity, self image, coming out, etc... GREAT BOOK"
4,A true story,"I got through this book in only two days, and I wish I had known of this book when I started to come out to my environment about one year ago. Actually I am still closeted towards my father and I think I am still not ready to tell him - even after reading this book. But I finally know that I will tell him one day; I first never wanted to tell him. For all you young gays/lesbians out there, I highly recommend this book to you. I think I could have had it much more easier the last year if I had owned it."
1,A modern morality tale in the worst way,"Bono's attitude, that her lifestyle is acceptable, is a reflection of just how badly her rock star parents failed and how far our society has fallen. Truly inane moron fodder. For half-wit blowhards only."
3,Inconsistent,I am returning the watch as it does not tell the time consistently. I have asked to exchange it for the smaller ladies version in hopes that a different style might work better. We will see what happens.I enjoy the concept but would like it to work all of the time.
4,Sera mejor si fuera en ingles.,"Vikki es una cantadora muy especial.Tambien tengo ""The Unforgettable Vikki Carr"". Este disco en espanol es mucho mejor por la musica y aparamente, liricos.Pero no me basta el espanol para apreciarlo.TR: It would be better if it were in English. Vikki Carr is a very special singer. I also have ""The Unforgettable"". However, this disk in Spanish is superior both in terms of background music and score as well as lyrics. BUT I am lacking in enough Spanish to really appreciate it.Try ""The Vikki Carr Christmas Album"" where she can go both ways without 1960s ""Petula Clark"" arrangements."
4,An unforgettable experience,"I will enjoy these two cds for many years. I liked Vicki's singing in CD #1 because of the obvious joy in her voice and the ritmo. The duet with Ana Gabriel ( I warn you ) tears at my soul. The two duets in CD#2 are also the highlights of this recording that is if you can overlook ""Zandunga"" which I can't."
4,Positive,"Two discs, neatly divided into Carr's Latin-pop repertoire and her more traditional mariachi side. An excellent compilation, though some liner notes could have made the package perfect."
3,Synergy Veterinary Formula Sulfatar,This product was okay. We have dog with serious skin flakes. He has been like that since a puppy and is now 12 years old. The past year he went through a really bad bout of skin irritation. I did not see a difference in his skin condition at all when using this product. I ended up going to the vet and getting some prescription strength. I found the pump on the bottle a pain - probably because the shampoo is so thick. I will not buy again.
2,The worst leg,"This is the most cartoony, worst survivor series in the history of wwe, and i really hope they print the rest, because this is just sad."
3,More Plum than metallic pur[le,"The violin and case where very nice. The case has a soft side gig bag feel, but it has a solid protective inside. The violin is a very well made starter violin,, but the paint job was not what I expected. I was looking forward to seeing a metallic/ electric purple finish, but what I got was a very flat plumy/ moave looking color. I hope that this review helps."
4,Chord book,This was a Christmas gift but unknown to us is similar to one currently owned by the new mandolin player. They were still pleased by the infomraiton presented and find it helpful in learning to play. Nice clear pictures for the the mandolin player.
4,A must-have.,"Great price, and just what I needed! Its been a big help for this beginner, and could help the pros as well."
4,Very Helpful,"I'm learning to play the mandolin and this booklet has been extremely helpful. It takes a little time to get used to the method for searching for the chord you need, but it is a great tool to have."
2,Mandolin Chord book,"The format for this book makes it difficult to find the fingering charts for some chords. I've seen better, but the size of the book makes it easy to stick in your case."
4,a must,if your a beginner or not this can help you out. Put it in your pocket and you can find any cord you need any where you are.
2,Poor Organization- too bad,Properly organized this would be a great book. The contents are all great. But good luck finding what your are searching for. I had higher hopes for a book like this. Very let down.
3,Wish it was spiral bound,"This is such a useful little book. It's got every chord you could ever need and it's organized by key (what a great idea). I would have given it 5 stars for the content, but it won't stay open without putting something heavy on it or folding it so the back gets broken. Trying to force my fingers into a tight, unfamiliar chord and having the book snap shut before I can get it is REALLY annoying. If the publishers read this, please, please, PLEASE make this with a spiral binding that will lay flat."
4,Very Handy,"This chord book easily fit into my hard case for my mandolin. It was easy to follow and with the variations on fingering for chords I could spot easy transitions for fast songs. I am a beginner and got this book to help me learn chords quick for campfire songs. The book is so handy, that when I lent it to co-workers for the summer, it disappeared. I'll eventually get another copy."
1,Out of date...,I purchased this as a reference for my masters thesis. In 2007/2008 it was really out of date and can really only be referenced for the early stages of distance learning.
3,"Good basic info, but *way* out of date","If you're new to Distance Learning, this book will be a good primer. It did help me to save about $2000 by directing me to a junior college that had the classes I wanted, rather than taking classes through the out of state school that granted my degree. However, two years is a long time in the evolution of distance learning, and the information is out of date for many of the programs. A great grad program at NYU was completely overlooked, as was the acquisition of University of Sarasota by Argosy University. Wait for the third ed."
5,"Excellent Cable, Excellent Price.","Price is virtually unbeatable in any retail store. While quality might not have that ""high-end"" feel that some of the super nice cables do have it is still a very solid product. Works perfectly and length is accurate.Would recommend to anyone looking to get a VGA or SVGA cable. Compare quality to VGA cables in the 15-20 dollar range."
1,I got a bad one,"The bag this cable came in had a ""Cables Unlimited"" sticker covering up a ""StarTech"" sticker. When I tried it, my multi-input TV could not detect ""PC connected"", which it can with two other VGA cables I have. I decided to open up the connectors and found that the cable itself seems to be good quality shielded cable. However, the RGB shield connections (pins 6, 7, and 8) were intentionally shorted together inside both connectors - not a huge problem, but not to spec. The real problem for my application was that pin 5 ground was left completely unconnected inside both connectors."
5,It must be in your hands! / ¡Tiene que estar en tus manos!,"Definitely, you must have this album in your hands, like the title. You will enjoy eight beautifil songs of this intense merengue performer, including ""En tus manos"" and ""Entre tu cuerpo y el mío"", international hits.Definitivamente, debes tener este album en tus manos, como el título. Podrás disfrutar de ocho hermosas canciones de esta intensa intérprete merenguera, incluyendo los conocidos éxitos ""En tus manos"" y ""Entre tu cuerpo y el mío""."
5,Highly amusing and highly accurate!,"The artist of this book has summed up some of the strange things that Americans will discover when visiting Japan. With headings like ""Toire : Terrifying Toilets "" and "" Venerable Vending Machines "" you can't help but chuckle along with the artist as she sees some of the strange differences between East and West. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone with a hearty interest in visiting Japan as it will serve as a 'cultural buffer' and ready them mentally for some of the strange sights they'll be treated to!"
3,Amusing if a bit brief,Cute illustrations and some useful Japanese words make this an enjoyable book to read but I finished it in 10 minutes so don't expect anything more than an amusing introduction to some of the unusual things a visitor would encounter. When I go to Tokyo I will bring this with me for some light reading on the plane.It is a clever idea though and a good supplememt to some of the drier guidebooks out there.
3,"It is a picture book, not a travel guide...","Yes, it says so in the reviews, but somehow I missed it. I thought it was a travel guide for the ""clueless."" I can see how it might be amusing to some Westerners though. Now I need to get a real guide book for our trip to Tokyo.... Got any recommendations?"
2,Falls apart,"Nothing better than enjoying your own home roasted espresso in the morning, no?This is the knockout box I am replacing. One reviewer didn't like the rubber hose. I don't mind that sort of thing. The size is fine. The quality is fine. The object is inexpensive and highly utilitarian.The reason I am replacing this one, though, is that the nuts holding the bar come loose periodically, requiring you to tighten them. Forget to tighten them and one will inevitably pop off in the middle of a vigorous pounding, leaving the puck to disintegrate into flying grounds (happened twice). The manufacturer should add lock-nuts to the construction.Also, the black base is painted fiberboard. Eh. Solid hardwood would be nice, but would cost more. Solid rubber might be better. So, I will get either this one RSVP Modern Espresso Knockout Box, or one from SweetMarias dot com, the site where I get all my coffee roasting gear.Good sipping and good hunting."
1,Bad fit,"The tin is too small for the box and moves around leaving scratches on the corners. The supplier was great great but the product is cheap. Also, it is way to big for most counters."
4,Good product,"The product was much larger than I had anticipated, but does a great job. Product received as described and on time."
1,Totally falls apart,"With regular use, this knock box just doesn't hold up. As another reviewer stated, the nuts on the bar tend to fall off, so we used thread sealant. But then with continued use the fiberboard fell apart at the joints. So we glued the joints. But then the fiberboard soaked up any moisture on the counter and finally swelled to a mushy rounded mass. So we coated it in duck tape. Eventually, the plumber's tubing split, exposing the bar, and we tossed it. We ordered a different knock box, but it turned out to be backordered and the supplier sent us another of these RSVP knock boxes as a substitute. Within a few months, the new box fell apart at the joints, and the fiberboard started to swell. I just tossed the wooden frame and put rubber cabinet bumpers as feet on the metal insert. Hopefully, the plumber's pipe will continue to hold."
3,Needs improvement,"This is convenient to have near the espresso machine. However the center bar began to bow after a few months. The construction of it could be of better material, steel instead of plastic."
2,"If tempted, avoid the dishwasher","the nuts on the outside do need to be tightened occasionally which is annoying, because i don't remember until it falls off. Tragically, the week after i bought it, someone thought it would be a great idea to pop the whole thing in the dishwasher. This is when i discovered that the box is pressed composite somethingorother and the glue that holds it together won't last that kind of abuse. i jury rigged it back together because i'm that girl. it got all bloated and looks hideous, but it works."
5,great cd,"I said in one of my other reviews i whis i had got into blues fusion earlier and i didnt this guy is fantastic .From forest of the pine to move on ,to hear by me his guitar playing is great.He can play the blues then come back with a real rocking song if u want to try something new like i did try blue fusion and try wes jeans you wont be dissapointed .I hope this review was helpfull to you"
3,What is it with these cowboy hats?,This album starts off with quite a bit of poke but sadly fizzles out as it goes further down the field.I know Stevie Ray has become legendary down Texas way but for God's sake guy'stry being an innovator instead of an imitator then and only then will blues/rock go forward rather than stagnating.So from now on any dude wearing a cowboy hat and wielding a Fender Strat I will take with a pinch of salt.
3,Motel Fetish,Krider has done a great job putting this book together. The overall quality is up to the high Taschen standards.The photos are very well done and the women are very good for the most part. The picture of Dita make it worth the purchase price.
1,TO MUCH DUST COMES OUT OF BAG. NO GOOD!,"Only bought once, as when you go to fill litter box, the dust that comes out is ""Harmful"" especially for people with ""Ashma"" like me. DO NOT RECOMMEND! May be cheap, but not worth your health!"
5,This is the best source around,I haven't been able to find any other JNI source that covers as many issues as this one does. I do admit that I haven't looked since this book has been doing the job so others may now. He goes through all of the different uses of JNI that one would encounter in practice giving many examples along the way. I especially liked the chapters on creating a JVM and an NT service application. If you are going to be using JNI frequently I definitely recommend this book.
2,"Not for C, C++ programmers",There is only one chapter (12) that directly addresses C or C++. Many of the questions that important to programmers in C++ are not answered. We found ourselves refering to Sun's docs and the header files.The tone and C++ content was distracting. I also found references to menu usage in Visual C++ and Sun specifics distracting. One page refers to how to avoid static libraries. I am quite proficient in this already and often use a different operating system than the examples.I am sure that for Java programmers and those with limited C++ requirements it is a fine book.
1,Don't waste your time,"You might as well just read the JNI specification instead of wasting your money on this book. It does have some useful information, however you would think a book dedicated to one topic would go into depth discussing it's aspects, but it does not. The examples are weak, and he doesn't even cover any AWT creation. Read the spec, then you can write your own Essential Java."
1,Save your money,This was a very bad buy. The examples are convoluted and he makes a lot of assumptions as to what you are going to be using. He is a funny writer but that doesn't make up for the lack of clarity.
2,Sun's tutorial online is much better,"If there is one good thing about this book it is that nearly all examples are written in C++, which the online tutorial at Sun's website doesn't do. But those examples are presented stiltedly and not in what I would consider a clear format.There are a couple of special topics which I consider valuable for people interested in those topics: such as making an NT service and serial programming. I however, was not interested in those topics.Gordon thinks he's witty, too (quoting great writers in the chapter headings). He's at best corny and at worst contrived."
2,disappointing!,"Based on the review I read, this protective case looked like the best pick. Boy was I wrong! First of all, I did not think the product description was clear about what the product includes. It includes: A black visor (that is also a stand and cover) and a stick on screen protector. The screen protector makes the image look grainy; the only good thing is that you can take it off easily and still reaply it later (unless you get dust on the side that goes against the screen, this is impossible to get off). The black visor screws into the two small holes on the top of your psp (you can twist them on with your fingers). It is wobbly when it is on, due to the many functions it is supposed to do. It does not clip at all when it is down, and so is not at all a secure screen protector. I can see how it would be useful as a sun visor, but there are many other products that are better made that also have this use."
3,more religious than spiritual,"I have loved this series, look forward to the book every year. I found this one disappointing. I felt like the selections were more religious than spiritual, with emphasis on moral values and Christianity. If that's your preference, you'll like this book better than I did. I'm a mystic, and not really interested in long academic discussions of what Kirkegard really meant."
5,Finally a DVD Release!!!!,"I saw this about two years ago on cable and I was very pleased about it. I really enjoyed it, despite missing the first 20 Minutes. I was waiting for a DVD Release for a while and it's coming.Break a Leg is a good film about a good actor who can't get a break. So he literly breaks a leg. No, not his. Other actors, filmmakers, etc. who will stop him from acting. It's a Thriller/Comedy/Drama and is very well made.Rated R - For Violence, Language and Themes."
3,"IT'S JUST ME, ME",OH WHAT ONE SUFFERS TO BECOME A MOVIE STAR! THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF A THIRTY SOMETHING YEAROLD MAN TRYING TO MAKE IT IN HOLLYWOOD. ALWAYS COMING IN SECOND IN THE AUDITION LINE.
2,Rather bad --,"even awful.Is there anything worse than a gathering of unknown actors playing the roles of bad, and badly self-conscious (even Molly Parker), actors who are convincingly ""acting"" like amatuers -- including those who are ostensibly successful?And then the best parts are played by Sandra Oh, who has less than fifteen seconds of screen time, and a guy who is instead a cop pretending to be an actor: better at it than all the other actors who, according to the script, had and or were training in acting.And I must have missed the widescreen."
5,Eric Johnson's Favorite Guitarist,"I saw this guy open for Eric Johnson in Texas and Eric introduced him as, ""my favorite guitarist!"" Mike was great. Eric watched the entire set and was smiling from ear to ear as Mike played. I got my picture taken with both of them and it hangs on my wall and is a prize possesion."
2,Too slow paced for my taste,Songs were not as rousing as I expected.The singer has only a guitar for most of the songs and no back-up singers making this a slow paced and uneven album.
3,A good start,"A good start if your just learning Maya. Not everything you need to know about dynamics, but enough to push you in the right direction. As with all of the 'Learning Maya' series, you'll find that they are more tutorial based than other books. Unfortunatly, it lacks a lot of key definition and doesn't show many if any cross referances to the other Maya subsets."
4,The only book that covers this topic,"This book is pretty much the only printed source of information that goes over the Maya dynamics in enough details. In addition to the traditionnal coverage of particles and emitters, it includes *lots* of useful examples on rigid bodies, constraints, particle collisions, soft bodies, etc. I think it's the most straight-forward way to get up to speed with this type of effects in Maya.One thing I really liked about this book, is how each topic is explained by example. Each example scene lasts 5 to 10 pages. This makes the book practical and motivating, since you can learn new techniques every few pages.BTW, it looks like version 5 and 6 of the book have a very similar content. I'd recommend getting the (much cheaper) old version for people who want to save some money."
4,The Rite of Baptism for Children: Ritual Edition NCCB,The Rite Book provides pastoral notes that are helpful in understanding the Rite as well as its administration. It does not have the type of layout that I would like but it serves the purpose.
4,Good so far,"I've only used this once, so I don't feel right giving it 5 stars yet, but I'm happy with it. The pan worked pretty much as advertised: I cooked a large batch of meatballs, covering the entire surface of the pan, then cooked a large amount of sauce with them. This is a biiig pan... yet it seemed to heat pretty evenly to the edges. Got very good browning, much the same as stainless steel. It's a bit of a stretch to call this a ""nonstick"" pan -it's no teflon- but it was far less sticky than stainless steel or regular Calphalon hard-anodized. I'd call it ""stick-resistant."" Also, the handles stayed surprisingly cool during use.If you go in with the right expectations - a well made, very large saute pan that heats evenly and resists sticking while searing well - you won't be disappointed."
2,"OK for sauteeing and sweating, no good for frying","Even after complaining to the manufacturer, getting additional cooking tips, and following them carefully, I was still unable to fry potatoes in the Calphalon Infused Anodized Sauteuse. The potatoes stuck horribly, making it effectively impossible to continue cooking them. Had to transfer to my old, scratched teflon pan, which did pretty well. The terms of the warranty do not allow for returning the item if you're dissatisfied, only for replacing items which are defective by Calphalon's standards, so I'm out $100. Well, this item is not a total loss because it is good for making sauces, but don't try frying in it."
2,Poor NonStick Action!,"We purchased this pan at Bed Bath and Beyond for $100 and returned it after one month for a full refund. While there, we noticed that all ""Calphalon One"" pots and pans have been clearanced out. Even at a greatly reduced rate they are not worth the money if you are looking for a nonstick pan. The pan is big and feels great but clean up is not like your typical nonstick because food sticks. I made steel cut oats using organic coconut oil and they still stuck to the pan each and every time I made them. We made other non meat foods and they stuck as well. I'm not saying food sticks as much as using a stainless steel pan but it doesnt work as well as other nonstick anodized pans. Considered knowledgeable cooks, we only buy high quality cookware/kitchenware since we cook a lot so I can not recommend this cookware."
2,Didn't like it -- too big!,"I got this for my mom because she wanted a good saute pan with steep sides and a fitted lid. Well, it is that, but it's also HUGE! It didn't even heat evenly on our glass-top Jenn-Aire range. If you have a nice big gas range (like a Viking), it would probably work okay, but on a normal person's stove? Useless."
5,Great pot,This is a really BIG pot! I had been searching for a pot large enough to cook a large batch of breaded chicken cutlets all at one time. This pot fits the bill. I am able to cook 6 large pieces all in one batch. This pot cooks food very well and also cleans very easily. It is also great for cooking a large batch of spaghetti sauce with meatballs. You can easily brown all of your meatballs in one batch (using 2.5 lbs of ground meat) with room to spare.
3,"Timely book, time consuming style and read!!!","This book comprises a consultant's accumulated accumulated knowledge from applying the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) to a range of client problems and businesses. It uses a rich panoply of actual cases, analysis and frameworks to develop its arguments and demonstrate how appropriate and adaptable BSC is to today's business. However, whilst the form of today's business is lean, and concerned with pace and execution, the style of this book is often cumbersome and slow to realise its points and conclusions. In summary, there are rich seams of applied knowledge in this book, but the mining of those seams is unnecessarily time consuming. Minus at least one and half points for my efforts! Callum Morrison"
1,Golf Shoes,"The size was wrong. Etonic has apparently altered their shoe sizes from past years. We matched the size from another pair of Etonic shoes and the new pair of shoes was different when they arrived, even though the stated sizes were the same. The shoes were returned for credit.John Martin"
4,Nice sampler of modern Asian techno,"Generally speaking, I'm not the world's biggest electronica-dance fan, but as the genre goes, I find myself frequently drawn to Asian-oriented releases, since they often seem to have more going on, rhythmically and melodically, than your typical club mix disc. I guess it's because they have to introduce some distinctively ""Asian"" element, such as a sitar or koto, or readily identifiable Chinese or Hindustani melody...*something* to set the music apart. Or, maybe, it's just that some of Asian mixmasters have better taste or a wider palatte than their Europhilic contemporaries. At any rate, this collection has plenty of nice, mellow, listenable tracks on it, and makes a worthy contribution to the growing catalogue of likeminded records that are available to inquisitive music fans. Worth checking out!"
4,A Mummer's Delight,"If you are from Philadelphia, or know anything about Philly, read this book! If you were here during the TMI crisis, believe me, you will get it. But I guess I can understand people from out of town not understanding what it is all about. Its about the Mummers, stupid! No other books that I know of so adequately takes the Philadelphia proletarian New Years holiday and projects it into an alternative radioactive present. It is the Kiss of the Killer Mummers. Glue some feathers to your Geiger Counter! Mummer up your plastic booties! Oh! Dem Golden Slippers, indeed!"
4,WHAT A TELL ALL ABOUT CORRUPTION OF NYPD,"Not to claim that Larry Davis was an angel because he was a walking demon, but his brutal lifestyle was mirrored to that of the NYPD. As one knows not all officers of law are corrupt. Having said that the depth of crooked officers that set out to kill this man and the attempt to off his family was a eye openner, but all to real for those who live in the hood. They police fueled his drug trade and when he wanted to opt out of the lifestyle of a drug dealer they wanted him dead and their money back. This one needs to be made into a movie. Forget American Gangster (although a great flick) this Larry Davis story would make millions money and bring an awareness to the corruption of certain police and the final end of individuals for getting into the drug game. This is a must see!"
3,Not bad....but,"Does make some noise, but it wasn't to the degree where it would really bother you while you slept. The main drawback was that there was no power button or way to turn off the machine without unplugging it. Why would you not have a simpler way to turn off the product? My outlet was behind a dresser so to turn it on and off this way was a major issue. I will be replacing it."
1,Only worked 3 times!,"I have owned other humidifiers, and while I was satisfied with the nice fine mist of this humidifier, it quit working after only three uses! We emptied the water after each use, and followed the instructions, but it just gave up. The other drawback was that this machine was quite loud and most family members' sleep was disturbed by the noise. I could not recommend this machine."
3,ok for price,"I tried fancy $79.99 humidifiers, and smaller ones, and all leaked. This one is so basic, and very plastic, but it works and doesn't leak. I would prefer an auto shut-off, but I am just glad it does what it is supposed to."
3,never got around to using it,i never used this mister but heard very good things about the perpeler ones. anyhow i would reccomend to a friend forsure.
1,Humidifiers leak.,"These humidifiers aren't putting a whole lot of water into the air, but they did soak the surrounding area. Water collects in a little well in which the top sits and eventually runs down the side or back of the unit. If you use one of these, set it in a basin or something to catch the drips."
1,Leaks all over.,I thought this was going to be great.Brought it home from the store plugged it in with water in it and it worked great.Used it while i slept and woke up with a floor covered in water. It slowly leaks and if you want to use it overnight say goodbye to your carpet.I am returning it today.
1,SOOOOOO loud,"This is the loudest humidifier I have ever had, I will be returning it. I can hear it (clearly and loudly) from 2 rooms away. There is no way I could sleep through the noise of the motor. Also, it leaks a little around the top, not a well made item."
2,Ok....that is all I got....,"Well I like the look and design for the most part. The ability to add water with out opening the unit is nice. The biggest problem I have is the sheer lack of humidity this unit produces. Even after nearly 70 hrs of running I notice very little improvement. I did remove the plastic oval with the fins and that helped somewhat. I have been using these things since I was a kid in the winter months and never had this issue with other impeller humidifiers. If it finally breaks in as they do sometimes I will change my review. I will give it 3 maybe 4 then, but I can't justify higher than a 2 if the purpose of the machine is lacking.update 1/21/2012After running almost constantly for 2 week the thing still puts out very little mist/humidity. I feel I bought a lemon."
3,Could pump more water out,"I had another of this type of humidifier years ago, and it was very efficient. This one seems to get the job done, but doesn't put out a heavy mist like my last one. This takes a few days to empty one tank, where my old one did it in 24 hours or less. I am waiting on a hygrometer to see if it actually is doing the job."
1,Don't waste your dollars!,"The unit works well in theory but is very difficult to clean properly. I cleaned it with bleach and ran the unit with white vinegar added to the water but nothing could stop the MOLD/WEIRD GROWTHS in this unit.... YUCK.The item has to be unscrewed for each cleaning. SAVE YOUR MONEY FOR A MORE PRACTICAL UNIT. Running the unit made my lungs burn from my mold allergy, I was better off without it."
1,Does NOT Humidify,"This humidifier does not work. I left it plugged in overnight in a very dry climate, and almost no water had evaporated by morning! No visible mist. Somewhat noisy."
4,Works fine,It's not too quiet but it does help the humidity level in a small/medium room. I use this during the day to make the nursery better for my baby at night. I don't run it at night due to the amount of noise it makes.
4,Easy to Use,"My mother brought this for me, because I have trouble breathing at night. It works great. It's easy to use and refill water. There is no on, off switch. It's not loud. I had it a year before mines broke. Great for the price listed on amazon."
1,Quiet my foot!,"I bought this unit because it said it was ""whisper"" quiet. If you replace the word ""whisper"" with ""freight train"" it would be a more apt description! My daughters are used to white noise as we have soft music playing in their rooms. I thought it would mask the humidifier. It didn't. It was so loud my daughter woke up and was scared. I'll be returning it today. If you're not bothered by noise then this would be an okay humidifer, but don't be fooled by their claims."
3,not very quiet,"to me, the product name is misleading. it's very audible and distracting if you want to get a child to sleep while using the humidifier. i ended up giving it to my son for his baby."
3,No on/off switch,"It stated in the description that it has one but it does not. Make sure you want to plug/unplug it every time you want it on or off. Otherwise, it is decent for the price."
5,Great reference!,"If you have Lego Creator, this is a really cool reference. Plus, you can find even more neat Lego stuff on the Internet at places like Adequate.com's Lego Maniac Guide."
4,You should see this it helps but boring afer you master it,"hey whats up people i had this book for a while and i read alot of it, it doesn't really help you when your super good at it but thats how i got super good at it because the book tells alot if you get it i guarantee you'll like it and t'll get you good i would of gave this book a five at the starting because it was cool but hey you could sorta get bored of it after you master the techniques of the games well thats it so see yah hope you have fun if you have it or when you get it see yah later."
2,Get the pillow ready,A New Germany- The first volume of the World At War could have been better both with information and trying to keep me from being distracted. It gave hardly information on Germany after World War I and it forgot serval very important facts on Germany's territory expansion such as it did not accuire all of Czechoslavkia and it forgot that Germany took Memel. But the World At War gets better and I think that anyone that is becoming a history professor should not miss this!
1,Difficult to tell,It's difficult to tell how good this video is. The copy I received has a very bad sound track - moves rapidly from audible to inaudible and back. I'm not going to order another one on the off chance that the problem is unique to my copy.
2,buy dusk and her embrace instead.... or something by emperor,"i was once really into cof, but their albums have been getting exponentially worse.and this particular album is about as mainstream as black metal can possibly get (is it even correct to label cof as 'black metal' anymore?).damnation and a day gets two stars only because i love 'paradise lost' and i dig the references."
5,?????,"what the hell happened? i love cradle but this is just like what the hell? but anyway i still like the album a crapload, just not as hardcore as they used to be"
3,"Fair, but doesn't compare with ""Cruelty...""!","To begin, I've been a CoF fan since they came out with their epic album ""Cruelty And The Beast"" (which I still consider the best). Unlike ""Cruelty..."" however ""Damnation And A Day"" lacks in everything that made this British band so pleasing to hear: the vicious drum beats of Nicholas, the guitar of Gian, and the lost 4 pages long lyrics cleverly written and hoarsed by Dani, and accompanied by Sarah Jezebel! Speaking of which, Dani's lyrics aren't as interesting. They lack the literary references from all his former albums. Like someone else mentioned earlier in another review, perhaps Sony as something to do with it! BUT my greatest fear is that CoF loose all their spunk, and turn like another Mansonite band for Hot Topic poseurs!"
3,Horrible attempt at Mainstream and wheres Miss DEVA!?!?!?!?,I'm sorry. I didn't really like this album. They changed. But my biggest beef is the lack of Sarah Jezebel Deva's backround vocals. She is really the only reason I listen to these guys. She's barely on it! GAH!
5,better than bitter suites...,"somehow i was dissapointed w/ they're last album ""bitter suites to succubi"" something about it just didnt sit well with me. but ""damnation and a day"" makes up for it ten fold! almost reminiscent of ""creulty and the beast"" in song structure and the order the songs are arranged, this brings back my faith in CoF. Dani's vocals are articulate as always, with his deep growls to banshee shreiks, i'm suprised he hasn't seriously destroyed his vocal cords. although this album is on the major label ""epic"" CoF hasnt changed or softened their sound at all! just as evil and dark as always. if you're a fan of CoF then why the hell havent you bought this album yet? if you're a newcomer to the band i suggest ""dusk and her embrace"" or ""creulty and the beast"" first, either way you should end up buying ""damnation and a day"" sooner or later."
4,Great gothic metal,People keep calling COF black metal. But they sound more new age gothic metal. Maybe there older cds was blaxk metal. Anyways this is a very good one better than the past few cds. They still have the darkness and not sold out like everyone said they have.
5,This Cradle Rocks!,"This was the album that made me consider Cradle Of Filth as a band to REALLY listen too. The first song I heard from Cradle was ""Mannequin""...I hated it. I absolutley loved the music, then came Dani (lol). Then for what seemed for no reason at all I bought ""Damnation And A Day"". Listened and LOVED it! The music is beautifully orchestrated...and the more you hear the more you crave Dani's vocal stylings. I am now the proud owner of MANY Cradle albums, and look forward to future albums. If you are unsure on Cradle Of Filth, I recommend you start out by buying ""Lovecraft & Witch Hearts"", and tell me you don't wanna hear ""Her Ghost In The Fog"" over and over again!Best Noted Songs: Hurt And Virtue, Better To Reign In Hell, Serpent Tongue, Babalon A.D., Mannequin, Thank God For The Suffering.Songs To Skip: None"
3,There are only two black metal bands I like,After picking up COF's new CD Nymphetamine I wanted to get one of there other CD's so I figyre I might as well get this one next. Well I won't get it right away I do want to say I believe it is very well wrtiner. I'm only giving it a three for now. It may very well go up. Now I'm a Christian but even being a Christain I do liek some good Black Metal. Black Metal that is well writeren and played. COF does that on both fronts from what I heard on Nympheramine. The only other Black Metal band that I like is Ram-Zet. Other then that I'm more into Power Metal and Death/Goth Metal.
3,Here Comes Stryper,"This album got them on Ozzfest which I saw. This was still when they had most of their original fans intact. Musically, it's another concept album- this time depicting Satan's fall from heaven with verses from the Bible. Though not very original in scope, this sees them jumping into the christian metal market, a la Stryper & Judas Priest, as afar from biblical referances, it wasn't very evil or threatening. It also was their least heavy to that point, but did chart in the U.S. billboard hot 100. Key tracks are: The Promise of Fevwer, Better to Reign In Hell, and Doberman Pharoah."
2,CRADLE WHAT HAVE U DONE!!!!!,"Ok, lets take a deep breath. Obviously because i am a cralde fan i gave this album 2 stars. if i werent i wouldn't even give it a one!!!! cradle of filth has obviously taken the wrong rode here. I mean were is the haunting, vampyric, dark cradle we always used to know!!! This is a discrace to black metal, and i wouldn't recommend it. Save your money guys, this album is a waste of space. Want some good music buy all cradle CD's from ""Principle of Evil made flesh"" RIGHT UP UNTIL ""Bitter Suites to Succubi"". This is some good music from the Melodic Black Metal kings!!!"
3,eh...,"Now, to those who say COF isn't ""true"" black metal, let me specify: From The Principle Of Evil Made Flesh to Cruelty And The Beast is Black metal. From Cradle To Enslave on, it was Heavy goth metal. And from Vempire to Midian, their work was outstanding. Every thing after Midian was OK or crap, and The Principle Of Evil Made Flesh is too ""raw"" to be considered part of COF's golden years. They were mainstream after Cruelty and the beast, and they were at their first zenith when the made Dusk And Her Embrace, and they were at their second zenith with Midian. Damnation And A Day doesn't have as much going on as some of their earlier releases, and they are less melodic in this release. The songwriting is ok, but mostly the album is mostly glam and glitz (as they had a huge budget when they signed to Sony) and poor songwriting. If you want a good filthy album, get Dusk and her embrace."
5,a creative masterpiece,"This is an excellent album. The drumming is superb, the guitars are heavy and intense, and the vocals are awesome. I love how this band uses the keyboard and the chick backing vocals. If you're a fan of this band, buy this album. If you've never heard of this band or you hate them just because all your friends do(like my friends) check them out and listen to what real metal sounds like."
5,A Masterpiece of Music,"This was the first Cradle of Filth CD that I purchased, and although I have subsequently bought Midian and In Death's Embrace (both extreamly good albums), this is by far Cradle of Filth's finest work. The problem with today's music is that if you buy a CD these days, you may have one or even two favorite tracks, with a few others that you like, and some that you just cant stand. Not so with Cradle of Filth on any of their albums. For Damnation and a Day, I personaly have at least seven favorite tracks (Hurt and Virtue, An Enemy Led the Tempest, Better to Reign in Hell, Serpent Tongue, Present From the Poison-Hearted, Mannequin, and Thank God for the Suffering), and all the rest I truly enjoy. This is one of the best albums I have ever had the privilage to listen to, and I await their new album's release with relish."
1,A music catasrophe,"As a gigantic Cradle of Filth fan, I bought this as soon as it was realesed. I was looking forward to listing to amazing riffs, hard fills, and well thought out lyrics. Well, I put it in and heard it the 1st time, hit the eject button and stopped listing. ""Maybe it takes time to understand,"" I thought. I have sinced them listened to the Cd many times and it is the worst Cd of the last decade. I felt musically rapped."
5,Another Awesome COF album,"My second COF album in my collection. I love the concept of the album. Makes it feel ""epic"". Definitly a must for COF fans."
1,Low on Gas,"While I love Cradle (Namely Vempire/Dusk/Cruelty) and many songs from other albums of theirs, this one just doesn't retain the edge. The album concept and art are interesting and essentially good, production is great, but the music is very flattened. The riffs are rather generic and indolent, the only exceptions being ""Hurt and Virtue"" and ""Mannequin"". Also, someone needs to shoot Adrian Erlandsson in the leg. It seems that as soon as the incessant droning of the double-bass ceases for a moment, it immediately starts up again.This record may be more accessible than others, but it runs out of gas quickly after you first listen to it."
1,minus a million stars is more like it,"Cradle of Filth suck and always will. They try entirely too hard to be ""individuals"" in black metal. Dani Filth rapes little girls and I blaspheme and don't tolerate anyone who likes this band. I heard through the grapevine that before going on stage they ask each other how their makeup(!) looks. If that doesn't turn off my true (Norgewian) black metal vibe, NOTHING will."
3,eh...good story,im not sure about this album. its got some amazing songs on it. but over all im not sure. but its damn good. if you like cradle and black metal buy this.
3,As good as it gets with this lineup,"This album could be 3 or 4 stars depending how you look at it. If you are still in your little goth metal dungeon waiting for dusk and her embrace to come back, you probably haven't cared about cof since Cruelty and the beast. I found Midian to be pure cheese, Bitter suites to succubi was a little better, and once i was able to get over the fact that Nicholas, Stuart, and Lector (or even damien) are gone forever, i looked at COF as a new band. I personally think this is a great album. I can't think of one song that i really have a problem with other than Babalon A.D. (So Glad For The Madness). The Iron Maiden influences are back too, especially in Mannequin, to my relief. So in the end, if you can accept the new sound, get this album, if not, don't waste your time"
5,I cannot take out my CD player!,"I first got into Cradle of Filth when I saw one of their videos on the Internet. At first I thought Dani's vocals were annoying, but then the music got my attention. Fast drumming, organs, and the change of vocal styles (screams, howls, singing, etc)!I went and got ""Dusk and her Embrace"" and liked it, then I got ""Cruelty and the beast"" and also enjoyed it.When I read an interview made to the singer Dani Filth in Revolver Magazine March issue about their latest album, the change of line up and the story behind the album, I went and purchased it right away!WOW, this is a great album, I listen to it almost everyday, fast, the drums are almost not human, Dani's vocals are tremendous, GREAT ALBUM OVERALL! The story line is also interesting and the art work! Go buy it, THIS IS METAL MAN!If you're in the US, go see them at OZZFEST this year!"
4,One of their best,"I'm not an obsessive CoF fan, I've got Dusk... Cruelty and Midian and this album. This is probably my favourite. The riffs on Damnation are a good mix of trebly black metal stuff and chunky grooves which I think is really effective, a whole lot better than Cruelty's riffs which I found pretty boring. I'm listening to Damnation now and it really is pretty good"
3,Starting to lose it.,"I love this band, I love Dani Filth. That's why this album is such a let-down. The guitar riffs are boring, if they're even there at all, and the mass-production makes everything sound muddy and blended together. I don't even care if they got the Budapest orchestra to play for them, the older keyboard work sounds just the same. I still love the lyrics/vocals, and the concept is very cool, but I think something has to change. The guitars need to come back, the insruments need their own space, and the computer animation needs to go away. Come on boys, get in contact with some of your old producers, they got it right."
5,HELL YEAH!,"Man, they have done it again. They have made a truely awesome album. What i cant get is why people say they are the korn of metal??? You wont see this on trl are anything cept MAYBE headbangers ball and thats it. But this cd rules, its now my favorite from CoF. Dani's voice is so awesome. Dani Filth is perhaps one of the coolest people alive. My favorite song is probally, what the hell am i saying, all of them are my favorites! This is by far the best black/death metal realease of 2003 so far."
5,god of metal,"When I first heard COF, it was like love at first sound. Their ability to blend melody with intensity is matched by no other. I always look for melody in music. COF does a good job cooridinating the guitar riffs with the percussion. They definitely know how to use the double bass drums on this album, and they know when to use them. Dani has incredible shrieks and screams, but he's not a bad growler either. I haven't heard their new album, Nymphetamine, but I intend to. By the time Damnation and a Day was produced, Dani had perfected his vocals. If you listen to Cruelty and the Beast, you can tell that Dani's vocals are going through a transition. You should also check out Dusk and her Embrace. It's different, but it's awesome. If your into black metal, check out Emperor. Their best album is In the Nightside Eclipse. To sum up this review, Cradle of Filth is awesome."
2,What happened?,"OK, I've been a CoF fan for years but it seems like their music gets worse by every album. After I listened to Damnation and a day I listened to Vempire and Dusk and her Embrace to see if it was me. It wasn't the music has just changed too much. It's good but not the Cradle of Filth I remember. The new style is more ... how would you say it ... never mind. But, it's just not good. The best songs are Hurt and Virtue, The Smoke of her Burning, Doberman Pharaoh, & the Promise of a Fever."
1,This Cd Isn't The Same Cradle of Filth That I Loved,"God dude Cradle of Filth suck now. They were so good on Midian, those were the good old days, huh? I dont know maybe its just me but they have changed alot and I dont like them now. I thought they would be always be my #1 black metal band but man has that changed. My new fav's are Dimmu Borgir, Old Mans Child, and Marduk. But after this cd, and I'm not saying that this is the cds fault but I kinda have curved away from black metal and went in2 hardcore bands like HateBreed, Mushroomhead, Skinlab, Machinehead, Soulfly, and some Slipknot. I guess now that I think about it this cd has alrght production but besides that everything is different. The ferocity isn't there as much and the lyrics aren't nearly as good but I guess to some fans this great and if they do fine. But if you're just getting in2 them try Midian to see what they are really capable of. Later"
3,MMM nOT bad... but it isnt COf scence,This album is not that great as the should be.... Is like there is no cradle.. is like youre listening to Marduk but with dani filth on the vocals...Cradle was the most mellodical Black Metal band... and now is like all that mellodical style goes away....The album doest have great songs... cause the kind of metal they are doing right now.... I think is because they change one guitar player...Gigs was for Dani Filth.. like Slash for Axel...Even Danis voice doesnt sound like always.....
2,...Say What???,"The singing sounds like a duet with Freddy Krueger and the Disney chipmunks- it hurts my ears! Good death metal?- Opeth, Mercyful Fate; Good heavy metal?- Mushroomhead, Dry Kill Logic, Black Sabbath; Good alternative/death?- Compression. Good Cradle of Filth? Never heard any."
3,im changing my five,"i only listened too this album once when i orginally rated it. After listening too it a couple more times i realized the more i listen too it the more i hate it. Cocepts albums all together shoulb be avoided and this is a prime example. Cradle firts attracted me with their diversity, somewhat, in tracks. in this one its hard to distinguish them."
2,Forgot the pockets!,"Yes, it's high-visibility. Yes, it's orange. Yes, it might meet ANSI standards.WHERE ARE THE POCKETS? The vest accomplishes the basic function of safety -- but without pockets, it becomes a hindrance. Oh, and it is mesh too."
4,Appreciating the Bitch,Aguiar forces the reader to re-think his/her opinion about the stereotypical bitch. She approaches the subject from all angles and includes an array of examples present in literary history. This book is a great reference source in the world of women's studies.
3,New to ebay,This is a great book if you want to find ebay stores in a hurry! However I did find that some of these stores no longer exist. It will give the novice ebay shopper great insight on how to shop and buy.
4,Nice piece,This is doing very nice with my IPOD nano. Nice volume with a pleasantly surprising bass level.
4,great for dorm room,"I got this speaker system for my son as a Christmas present. He is very happy with its small size, great sound, and the remote that works from his bed. The blue light looks ""cool"", according to him. I wish it also had a clock/alarm feature, but I guess the old-fashioned kind will need to suffice."
2,Cheap product in every way,"I thought this sounded like a great deal and reading the other reviews I bought it and found it doesnt work with my ipod (early version) the only thing I can do is turn it on and off and adjust the volume. All other functions dont work with early versions of ipods...so, I cant recommend this at all."
2,Attractive Price Not So Attractive Sound,"For about 2.5 times the cost of a plain docking station you get a playback system. However, the sound quality is terrible because of significant distortion beyond the lowest of volume. After spending $250 for my iPod I did not want to spend upwards of $300 for a playback system. The iPod clock radios are just plain ugly so I passed on these $99 machines as well. The Eton Sound 50 is attractive and priced well. However, if you enjoy quality music sound -- you dont even have to be an audiophile -- then pass on this unit. I would not purchase this unit again, so when my budget allows it I will upgrade."
5,Looks & sounds great!,"I am very pleased with this system. My daughter has a different type, and it just doesn't compare.The sound quality is much higher than anyone at the office would have thought. I have been asked several times as to whether the volume is turned up all the way. Then I hit the remote and bring it up to 1/2 volume, and they are blown away!I would recommend this to anyone. I have a Nano, but my daughter's video iPod works just as well."
2,Did not charge my iphone,Good speaker and sounds Amazing!But it didn't charge my iPhone 4s.what gives?Is it because the one I got is defective or it is not compatible?Can anyone tell me it works with their iphone 4s?

1,"Very weak comedy, sorry to say.","I always liked David Steinberg when he was a guest on late night TV, long ago.I had never seen ""The David Steinberg Show"" before. It's surprisingly very weak comedy.I can't imagine anyone laughing very much at this stuff, today."
5,Face of Evil,"Ms. Doherty takes the reader into a comfortable suburb and then reveals a darker side to charm, ambition, and ""good will."" These suburbanites are typical community leaders and parishioners who reveal themselves, and are revealed, to be more complex and certainly more devious than expected. Murders occur and the unraveling of the crime is as surprising as the human personality itself. This expertly crafted novel engages the reader from beginning to end and offers insight into people you thought you knew. Evil is more ordinary than we want to believe and flourishes in unexpected places."
1,CATS Fans Can Pass On This One,"Any fan of CATS would probably never miss this CD from their collection. The music is weak compared to the cast recordings from London, Australia, Germany or Broadway. The vocals, while undoubtably sung by talented singers, can't compare to the actual performers in the show. Not to mention that even large group songs were sung with apparently only four or five people, which loses much of the power from the original vocals. People wishing to experiance the show via a recording would do better to buy an actual cast recording to hear the show as it was ment to be heard.There is one instrumental track on this CD (Memory), and that does make this CD good for at least kareoke."
4,A Good Book,"This was a very interesting and enjoyable book. The viewpoint from which it was told gave an interesting insight into the life of the Lakota in general and Crazy Horse specifically. However, I did not learn any new ""hard"" information about Crazy Horse. I already have read in other works about the incidents of his life such as his role in the Battle of the Little Bighorn, his lost love, etc. It is always a surprise to me that when a book like this is published it is touted as ""finally, an account told from the Indians point of view."" I have read many accounts told by Indians who were the actual participants in these events. The books and stories are out there, you just have to look for them."
4,Crazy Horse,"Good insight on the life of Crazy Horse and the ways of the Sioux. Gives the viewpoint of the Indians for a change, not how the U S Army or the politicians of the day have portrayed thr era."
4,Sins of the Past,"The murder of Crazy Horse occurred one hundred and twenty-five years ago. The story of his death has been become a legend in the Lakota tribe. Our author tells the story of Crazy Horse and his work to have a fair peace with the United States. This is a sad part of our history. Our forefathers took what they wanted and on their terms. There have been some efforts where later generations have tried to compensate but most of the benefits have been eaten up in our bureaucracy. I don't have an answer and we cannot correct the past. This was a very well written and interesting book. By Ruth Thompson author or ""The Bluegrass Dream"""
3,Too lacking in analysis and references,"This book is too lacking in the analysis of Crazy Horse's political and military strategy, it lacks references (its prime source is Indian word-of-mouth) and it is too much an hagiography. Nevertheless a decent introduction to the man and, much more importantly, his predicament."
2,NOT ENOUGH ABOUT CRAZY HORSE,"LOTS OF GENERAL INDIAN INFO,ALREADY KNOWN BY MOST WHO READ INDIAN HISTORY. NOTHING NEW ABOUT CRAZY HORSE."
2,Ok if you want a very cheap option,"These are perfectly fine but like some other reviewers have noted, the metal pieces on the back aren't able to fit around the visor. Because of this, the metal pieces stretch and definitely do not sit flush."
5,This book is a must read!,"If you, or anyone you know, has cancer, heart problems, rheumatoid arthritis, gastrointestinal problems, migraines, or other common afflictions, this book can prevent a lot of pain and suffering, or even save your life.If you mearly have an interest in health issues, you should read this book.This is NOT a self-help book. What it is, is a compilation and commentary on research into the psychosomatic and characterological components of illness, written in lay terms. It also offers findings on studies regarding psychological therapies for these problems, with clues to areas to address in self work.For a technical medical book, I found it immensely readable and very insightful."
4,It is a good start,"This book is a good start to building your own pond. I would suggest it as a inexpensive first step to pond building. What I learned in my experience was there is just too much to consider when you want a high quality pond. I used a professional biologist to design my pond and got terrific results. I was happy I knew the basics from this book so I could speak somewhat intelligently with the fishery biologist. After investing tens of thousands of dollars, I learned that the small amount I spent on this book and the professional advice was well worth it. I was so happy I got a nice clear fishing and swimming pond instead of a muddy mess or one that was weed infested."
2,Lots of Prose......No nuts and bolts.,"All those pages, all those words............yet if you are looking to satiate an appetite for information that will allow the building and managing of a pond...you will go hungry.It's an average book for an average day for an average consumer, but not for construction or problem solution.I will sell my copy or leave it as a ""coffee table"" book.Sorry, but I made a bad purchase choice."
3,Earth Ponds,I was looking for more techinical and not so wordy reading. It was interesting reading in a Walden's Pond sort of way. I want to build a pond myself and have the equipment to do it. But wanted to know How the big boys do it.
2,"Earth Ponds: The Country Pond Maker's Guide to Building, Maintenance and Restoration","i was looking for a book to help me design and build a pond, this book was more of a story, with a few helpful idea's."
3,I'd start with another,"Probably worth the price, but unless you are a complete dirt brother, I start with a different book. If you are a complete dirt brother, and are looking for the cheapest pond possible, this may be the only book you need."
3,Nice detail but very bulky,I purchased this as a gift. I wasn't as impressed with the item when I received it as I was with the picture. It is quite bulky and very heavy. You would need a wall anchor or to screww it onto a beam to hand it. I would worry about it ruining the wall bacause of the weight.
4,"Very Good, but Heavy","I am very happy with this pan. The one thing I don't like about it is its weight--I really do need to use the handle in order to lift it (even when the pan is empty, if I'm not holding it at the right angle)."
3,It's OK,"I bought this book thinking it would offer new practice techniques that I have not used in the past (having played electric guitar for years before switching to classical), but it didn't. If you are creative enough you know that the best practice consists of stretching exercises, scales, arpegios and always practice what you are worst at. This is good if you are not create regarding teaching yourself. I will probably put it for sale on eBay really cheap. Look for it there."
3,too much spice,"I love the recipe ideas in this book, however the quantities for spices listed are WAY too high. Before I learned this, i would make a recipe according to the directions, and then I would have to make it again using no spices at all, and mix them just to make it edible. again, the ideas are good, just use caution when using their quantities of spices!"
3,lots of ideas,This is a great cookbook if you plan on staying home for the 3 hours or so it takes to make these recipes - for many of the recipes you have to come back in an hour to add or do something extra to the recipe.
4,Joy of Cooking for the 1 1/2 Quart Crock pot,"The only book with recipies for this size crock pot that I've found. The recipies aren't just for tailgaiting parties. Check it out you might be suprised!Crockpot SCR151-WG 1-1/2-Quart Round-Shaped Manual Slow Cooker, White"
2,Great Variety,"I've made over 14 of the recipes in this book and my husband and I have loved every one of them. The recipes are simple to follow, but taste complex. This book offers a great variety of ethnic food items in addition to your regular ol' pot roast."
4,This is one of Ann Rule's better books,"I like some of Ann Rule's books. This was one of her better ones. It's a collection of murder stories. One story (of Randy Roth) is actually a full length book (about 340 pages) and I enjoyed it. Without going into too much detail, it's about a serial marryer (I guess that's the word) who's also a serial wife murderer. Of course, he's despicable and narcissistic and Ann Rule does a great job of following his story and the reader grows to detest him. The other stories were disturbing and I had some difficulty reading them. I know it was an added bonus to have them in the book, but I didn't enjoy them. The Roth story was good and could stand by itself as a book."
1,A really bad book,"This book seems to be about nothing very much except that the author has a few dodgy friends. I travelled in Cambodia before. You see some rubbish people there, but you do anywhere. Gilboa's adolescant meanderings will appeal only to those who, like him, have a vicarious fascination with low life and want to to tarnish a whole country with its portrayal. A similar book could be written about any one of a dozen poorer countries. Why bother. Only the dreary will get anything out of this selectively and badly written, adolescant tripe."
1,Not very realistic or honest,"I've been to phenom penh several times and saw this book for sale there. I realize that this book is listed as non-fiction but I think that it gives a very unrealistic portrayal of the city of phenom penh as viewed by a minor group of expats. I was hoping that it would describe a city that I actually love very much but I found it to be way off base. In addition, it was poorly written as though he just gathered up a bunch of scenes (and at the ends of some chapters just quotes from friends) and threw it all together. Nothing really holds it together. I just have to wonder if there's a point to all of the things that are in this book since it seems more like one ""wow, dude, check out this"" bit after another which gets old very quickly."
5,the best taste of expats on the road,"It gives an informative view on the dark hearts of insanity that lived and existed in Cambodia during the late 90's. Soon after putting this book down I upped and flew to Cambodia to see who these foreign residents were. There aren't as many guns on the streets, and prostitution has been put in check (a little bit), but you can still feel the streets seething with its rawness that this book perfectly captures. If you are ever caught by the life and times of insane foreign nationals and you want a glimpse at just how ""up river"" this world can get, this is your book... Like a true Marlow chronicaling his journey for the world-"
4,decent enough,"this writer seemed to whore his way through Cambodia back when that was the main reason that expats were living there. His story is interesting enough and has some anthropological value though he is not a very charming writer. He describes it all with such prosaic numbness, not for any literary effect but because he is not really a very skillful writer. Still, for fans of writing about the Asian underworld, this is a good read, just don't expect literature."
4,Interesting overview of the Pnomh Penh scene,"This book gives a pretty good description of the situation today in Pnomh Penh. Of course the writer oversimplifies a lot of things and tries to give a comprehensive coverage based on a short visit. But overall, he did a good job of introducing Pnomn Penh today."
2,Good for its time but not representative of Cambodia today,"I first read this book about 11 years ago when I was making my backpacking trip through SE Asia. While I enjoyed the book at the time, the book was written well over a decade ago.Phnom Penh has changed markedly since that time, and even the related AIDS epidemic is getting under control in the country. While this might be an interesting piece to read in order to gain an idea as to how the place was in the late 1990's, I don't think it will hold up well over time.So while I would have easily given it 5 stars a decade ago, I can't justify more than two now. The book is simply not relevant to today's Cambodia."
5,Spot-on tour de force through SE Asia's Dodge City,"Off the Rails in Phnom Penh is spot-on, an accurate and fascinating tour de force through SE Asia's answer to Dodge City and Sodom and Gomorah, and we're the people to know it. As a private investigator in Thailand, we have done several cases in Cambodia. So naturally I picked up a copy in the Juliana Hotel in Phnom Penh. Recently I passed on several copies to people from a company with a case we were helping with in Phnom Penh. His book maps the way to anyone courageous enough (read: crazy) to attempt business in a place God's forgotten."
5,A fascinating insight to degradation,"Having lived in Phnom Penh during UNTAC in 1993, this book made me feel like I was once again there. A truly fascinating insight to a world that I either never new existed or, more likely, was too scared to admit existed. Aside from the guns, girls, and ganja Phnom Penh is a fascinating place to visit, and this book made feel like I was once again there, feeling the unique sensory overload that is Cambodia.Well done Gilboa for a true and accurate account of the other disgusting side of humanity."
5,Description of Cambodia and the expats who live there.,Very good book which gives an interesting insight into the subculture of english teachers and other expats who live in Cambodia. The book also provides an extensive picture of the normal Cambodians and the country.Amit has spent a lot of time with expats in Phnom Pehn who were not aware that he was writing a book. The world that they live in is unreal and devoid of the usual rules and morals of society. When you read the book you will be disturbed by some aspects as well as laughing and wondering if all these bizzare people really exist but Amit assures us that they do...
2,Certainly no Hunter S. Thompson,"While I had a couple of laughs, this book would've been a lot more fun if the author was a better storyteller. The shallow pseudo-informative bits on Cambodian culture & politics don't help either. This book should've been written by one of the lowlife drifters Gilboa tries to portray. Someone who's been shagging fourteen year olds and smoking dope for years, not by a boring business journalist. Still, it's probably a good book to carry around for backpackers hoping to strike up a conversation on the bus or the beach. Try doing that with a copy of Agrippa's Three Books of Occult Philosophy."
2,Clever but not very helpful over all.,This is an OK book but not as indepth as I would like to help plant and maintain a serious orchard around my home. Lots of feel good philosophy and such but very restricted in types of fruit and their care. There are many more books out there that would be more useful to me.
1,not quite,"The case is too big for the iRiver Clix2, and the holes are not in the right place. Some one screwed up on this one.However, Gomadic was great. When I notified them, they immediately issued a credit for the full amount. Their service is superior."
5,Fantastic Product,"Designed to be sturdy. Slightly bigger than the clix 2 player, but I would rather have it that way so it can be yanked out easily. It acts like a protective box which doesnt crumple under pressure and hit your clix 2. The holes are at the right place, so that the headphone can easily come out. The flap which shuts it close is quite sturdy and automatically clasps on to the magnet and ensures a lock everytime you let go of it.Overall a good product ! and Classy.."
4,Nice product - installed easily,"I just redid 2 bathrooms and originally looked at local stores for hardware. This is a nice product and comes in several finishes for the same price. I ended up looking for this line after I saw it at Bed Bath & Beyond. Some but not all pieces are lower priced, so check the prices first. But it looks nice in the bathrooms. Can't quote on durability yet, but my kids will determine that soon enough."
2,should be read in one sitting,"This book is so short it should be read in one sitting to fully enjoy it. I regret I didn't read it in one shot. There are not enough breaks in the narrative for putting it down to be picked up later. There is no real story, just the diary writer's funny and pathetic underachieving in every aspect of life, starting from birth. His overachieving twin brother is his foil."
4,Humorous Look At Sibling Rivalry,"Cast in the shadow of his successful, handsome, well-liked twin brother, the main character of this novella takes you through the unfortunate events that have made up his life. A quick read that will make you laugh out loud."
4,Worth reading for sure,"This book was quite enjoyable to read, but it unfortunately ended too soon! Being from MA myself, it was especially interesting to me."
1,A REAL Under Achiever,"For some reason the title pulled me to this book. I guess I should have been warned with the ""underachiever"" in it. But, I had faith that Anastas could pull it off. I was wrong. Another tale of a boys life through the hardships of growing up. I don't understand how so many people can continue to write about the same old stuff and think that it is even remotely new to the readers."
1,Utterly without merit.,"I have two questions...How did this garbage ever get published?Why did I bother finishing this trash?One of the worst books I've ever had the misfortune to read it's only redeeming quality is being under 200 pages.A fictional diary from a complete loser. Pity the poor, upper middle class boy who had, if not everything then more than most and who never tried, never accomplished, never did anything worth writing a book about.The author should be run out of town if he ever even looks at a pen, typewriter or word processor again. Please, don't try. Follow in your un-hero's footsteps and give up. NOW.Seriously, if you want to enjoy the adventures of an underachiever rent or buy the DVD set of Fox's 'Wonderfalls'."
4,Really enjoyed this CD,This cd has a beautiful rendition of Hey Diddle Diddle as well as several other enjoyable beats. They get back to the jazzy roots of the music and provide a melody that is easy to listen to as well as dance to (you should see my son bounce up and down). Definitely recommend.
5,Grandchildren's delight,"Having lived in the Netherlands for 25 years but never having quite lost my American roots, I searched for a cd of quality American music to give my dutch grandchildren- and I found it! The Mother Goose Jazz band uses familiar nursery rhymes encapsulated in the contempory genre of jazz without sacrificing musical excellence. Knowing the compulsive need of small children to play again and again those songs that capture their fancy and imagination, one would think a grandmother's sensibilities would be tried to the breaking point but lo and behold! I found the tunes pleasurably running around in my head. I look forward to next release from that talented group."
2,Disappointing. You Can do Better,"We did not like it and do not listen to it. I say that as a parent experienced with lots of children's music, and a semi-jazz enthusiast.If you want to expose your children to really great jazz, then buy Joe Cool's Blues by Wynton Marsalis or A Charlie Brown Christmas by Vince Guaraldi Trio. And if you want great Children's music, buy a Raffi CD."
1,Big Mistake,"I was really excited when I saw this in the store, so I bought it. It was a huge mistake. I am a die hard Bon Jovi fan and this was just terrible. The music was tacky and it was boring."
3,there's no vocals,"this cd is weird, they picked some of the worst songs from bon jovi, like runaway. also there 's no vocals, it's definetely weird, i wouldn't pay money for it ."
1,Huh??,"I am a huge Bon Jovi Fan having every album he has produced. SO when I saw this CD in a local store I picked it up, thinking, cool! I couldn't even tell that these were his songs most of the time! The second hald of the cd was ok, but the first part was so full of electronic warbling that the real sound was lost. I reached my most angry at ""Wanted Dead or ALive"" where this styling reached its wordt. Still, several of the songs were decent. I wish that the artist had just produced a straight acoustic rendering and left of the electronic extras."
5,A Great Tribute Cd,"This was a great tribute cd to Bon Jovi. They picked really good songs and made them sound really cool, by using computer effects.If you like to listen to new sounds and discover new sounds of Bon Jovi songs then you should buy this cd, this was the reason that I bought it"
5,scientifically clear,the perfect book to understand the link between science and the arts of the mind.well written and clearly presented
1,"Good idea, Too bad the design doesn't work!","I purchased this board book for my 18-month old son thinking it would be a neat alternative to lift-a-flaps and pop-ups. It is a good idea, but the design does not work at all!You are supposed to be able to slide apart the pages to reveal whose mommy has a ...(curvy long tail)? However, when you try to slide the pages apart, they don't slide easily at all, even for an adult. Once you are finally able to pull apart the pages, they either don't slide all the way out to reveal the entire wording inside OR the pages pull completely off!Very frustrating, since my son seemed interested in the text and pictures, but now he just thinks this book is supposed to be pulled apart!"
3,A Non-Sliding Surprise Book,"My child is 18 mos. Great concept, but the pages don't easily slide.I also thought this book was too short, even for an 18 month old.I wouldn't purchase again."
5,Perfect book for toddlers!,Our son is 14 months old and loves this series of books. His face lights up when I bring out the book and he always enjoys the surprise we get when sliding open each page. Perfect size for taking along on car rides and in the diaper bag. Also extremely durable board book. Highly recommended!
5,A Painted House (DVD) based on novel by John Grisham,An excellent movie breathing life into the story and characters as depicted in John Grisham's story.I loved the book and this film really does it justice. A must have for any John Grisham fans.
3,"Covers most of the main themes in the book, but overall pretty thin.","I ordered this movie because first and foremost it is a John Grisham story, and secondly, I enjoyed the book on which it is based. However, perhaps because it was a made for TV movie, the writing, casting, and acting are not nearly of the same caliber as in other movies based on John Grisham novels, i.e. ""the Pelican Brief.""I do not recommend this movie if you are counting on the quality of a Grisham novel in movie form. Hold off until it is remade with a better budget and higher production values."
3,The Painted House (movie) from the novel by John Grisham,"After finishing the novel, I had high hopes for what might be done by a skilled screenwriter and talented character actors. I will definitely have to wait. The whole story was cobbled together and abbreviated to the point of fear that anyone might actually be credible and real. The boy wasn't even frightened when Cowboy threatened to kill his mother if he ever spoke to anybody about Hank being killed. At least, if he was, I couldn't feel it. This is something I never foresaw when I ordered it up. Every other movie made from a Grisham novel has been totally plausible and absorbing, this one was made for a child, and not good even at that."
3,Love the Book,"I read the book first and loved it. However, the movie seemed to drag on. But most of the time I am not as happy if I read the book first."
4,"A decent, solid movie","For me, this movie isn't so much about the individuals - it's about the families trying to scratch out a living in the delta area of eastern Arkansas, and what life was like for them in the early 50's. It had an impact on their values and how they faced the troubles in their lives. They had to stick together to survive.Trivia: the movie got my curiosity going about that old pickup truck the family had. (For those who also wondered: it was a '38 or '39 Ford.)The DVD: the usual Hallmark DVD (no captions or subtitles), but it had a few more scenes than the version that was televised by the Hallmark Movie Channel."
5,A Painted House,"Its a great movie, however the sound track is bad and makes the viewing and listening very difficult"
2,A major disappointment,This was one of my favorite John Grisham books. When I learned it was a movie I could not wait to see it. Now that I have seen the movie I wish they never made it. It has the worst narration I have ever heard. The narrator spoke with no feeling or emotion and you could clearly tell he was reading from a script. I guess you can't expect much from a made for TV movie but I was expecting more. Great parts of the book were left out and the actors did a fair job portraying people that were so clearly defined in the book. I wonder if they even read the book?
2,Read it instead.,"If you see it you'll never want to read it, a great book to read. The movie didn't carry the half of it."
2,The book was better... by far...,"This was my first John Grisham book and I absolutely loved the book, and I, too, was excited about seeing the movie. The acting was bad, the narration and script was terrible, there were parts of the book left out (which is understandable) and a few things were twisted a little. I don't feel like any of the characters were really developed in the movie. Overall, I'd recommend reading the book because the movie was a poor depiction of a great novel."
3,R.L. Stine Does It Again,"Return of the Mummy, is by the creative writer R. L. Stine. He is a very interesting writer with excellent ideas. Okay, imagine having a famous archeologist as an Uncle. He has been digging pyramids for a couple of years now. He invites you to open a secret tomb he has just discovered. This is the story of Return of the Mummy. Sari, and Gabe are the two main characters in the book. Sari is a total bragger. She tells Gabe about an Egyptian superstition which is supposed to wake the dead. Sari, the bragger challenges Gabe to say the six words (superstition). Will Gabe take the challenge? Can a superstition wake the dead? Find out by reading Return of the Mummy."
3,A Must Read Book,"Return Of the Mummy's Tomb is a very good book for ages 9-12. Kids will like it because it is about mummys and kids my age are in to these characters.The best part of the book in my opinion is when Nila stole Gabe's mummy hand to summon her brother from the dead as a mummy. Another good part in the book was when Nila commanded the mummy to kill the kids so no witneses were left. When the mummy went after the kids' he had a death grip on his sister's neck and said, ""LET ME REST IN PEACE"". The other part I thought was good is when Gabe and Sarri thought their Uncle Ben was killed.I enjoyed this book because it was a topic I am interested in. I like to read about supernatural ideas like a mummy's, magic, dragon's, and dinosaurs."
1,Robert's Book Review,"Dear Reader,This is the best book in the world. The writer is R.L. Stine. Everyone should read this book. Because this book alows kids to have a good education. They can be interested in this book. This book can make 1 childs parent happy. Just get your child to read this book. It will change his or her life.Sincerely,Rattle Snake"
2,Not exactly a Bible...,"I am a little disappointed with this book. It's definitely NOT a ""bible"". Basic Swishmax is pretty easy and obvious. The harder part of Swishmax is the scripting side - something this book does not cover very well. If you are a complete novice, then I'm sure it is good - If you are looking for a reference book that you can flip open and find an answer to all of your questions, keep looking. There are a number of free websites out there that are very informative on this subject."
3,Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About SWiSHmax,"The Official SWiSHmax Bible is at best comprehensive, and at worst, scary due to its size and detail. None the less, whether you are a fledgling or an expert, The Official SWiSHmax Bible is de rigueur if you want your animation to be truly animated, not just moving around.D. Allen"
3,Swish Max,"I haven't used it fully as yet, because the black and white pages put me off. I am a visual person and would have liked some examples printed, some images and some colour.However, no doubt that the answers I require should be in the book...it's just a matter of finding them.Perhaps if you are have used Flash in the past the book will definitely make more sense."
5,Works great.,This works for my aquarium. The plants are growing well. It doesn't alter the water chemistry as far as I can tell and it lasts a long time. It's hard to get 20 words to review this product.
2,No space to write,"The photos are lovely, but I wouldn't have bought this calendar had I realized that most of the date boxes are filled with (rather pedestrian) travel tips, leaving no room to write down appointments, theater and music performances, birthdays, etc. The calendar description should make clear that Romantic Europe is strictly for gazing, not for notating."
5,I love the CD.,"If I could only put another star on the rating scale,these compilations should be a best seller..I love the songs and the artists who interpreted them ..another five stars too. Reader's Digest is truly commmitted to music lovers like myself..that's why I have given all the box sets a 5 star rating...what are you waiting for,you won't regret having them played over and over again....maybe someone up in the heavens are playing the Reader's Digest collections too,who knows?"
4,These melodies linger in your heart.,"The Readers's Digest producers gathered the all time favorite love songs, recorded by known artists, and gave the public a wonderful boxed set. If a person knows what 24 Bit mastering is, perhaps there would be no disappointments. The sound quality could be improved, perhaps by live performances."
5,UNBELIVABLE,the only word that can describe this song its everything you expect in a song and more i'd give it a 10 if i could
2,Nice doll -- but a real pain to use in the bath!!!,"We gave this doll to my daughter for her 4th birthday last year. While it is a lovely doll and she plays with it often, calling it a ""bath doll"" is something of a joke. If you want a doll your child can take in the bath, then dry off and play with, this is not the doll! It takes lots and lots of prolonged squeezing and drip-drying before she can come out of the tub and be played with (otherwise water keeps dripping out of her joints -- legs, arms, neck, eyes) It is usually several days before ours can be played with dry, and that is only after an adult has vigorously squeezed and shaken the doll several times to get all the water out of her head, arms, legs etc. I thought a bath doll would be solid or sealed plastic, so the water couldn't get in. If I were buying a bath doll again, I would not buy this product."
3,gotta have it----better than velcro,"These work well until they begin to wear out ,then the radar detectorwill fall as they lose their grip. It's about ayear that they last and others have tried velcro but it melted and never came off from the dash soooountil something else comes along this is the best out there."
1,My friend bought this,"I have to say the suction cups simply don't hold well, got to the point that my friend just used velcro."
2,What a cheap piece of garbage,"If I did not pay so much for my cordless radar detector I would have thrown it out a long time ago. What a pain to have to keep buying these cups that only last for a short time. They need to come up with a better way of mounting the detectors so you do not need to keep coming back for this accessory, or maybe that is what they want."
5,Bracket hold up!,Worked as advertised. This was either a factory original or a great knockoff as it worked great. It doesn't have any moving parts and is pretty basic so it doesn't have to do much. I rate it 5 of 5.
2,This should come offered with the escort detector,outside of being disappointed that this doesn't come with the radar detector all is well. just another way to get into my pockets!
1,Cheap.,The suction cups are the same cheap cups that come with the unit. If you need new cups go to a hobby store and buy some designed to hang small artwork off windows.
5,Good Match,I was happy to obtain this item when I found out that it was a perfect match for my radar ditector which was about ten years old.
1,why no translations??????,i bought this dvd as it was advertised as subtitles and there are none except in english!!!why not in foreign languages as i can not share this with others withoug spanish subtitles!!!
1,Absorb. Meditate. Repeat,"Ahhhh Wayne...making lots of money telling us the same thing over and over and over.If you already own Dyer books, tapes or DVDs...save your money. It's just repackaged Dyer."
2,Save your money,One of the worst works by Dyer. I like and respect his philosophy but this movie is not worth buying it. I would rather recommend his Being in Balance CD set.
2,Disappointed,This movie does not compare to Wayne's regular DVD's. Has a sorry plot. Difficult to understand. Did not have subtitles so you could follow what the actors are saying all the time. I was disappointed and feel it should be redone and everyone not liking it get their money back.
4,The Shift...,"I am a fan of Wayne Dyer and have been since the '70's. With The Shift, I think I just expected something else...not quite sure what that is. However, I'm glad I purchased The Shift as I always get something out of each and every one of Dr. Dyer's programs."
4,Previous Movie RePackaged!!!!!,"First of All, I love Wayne Dyer and I own everyone of his books, CD's, wisdom cards and now DVD's etc. He is an amazing teacher. I cannot for the life of me understand why his previous movie, ""Ambition to Meaning"" was sold under the new title, ""The Shift"". Hay House (where I made my purchase) should have made it clear that it was the same movie re-packaged. Nowhere was that mentioned in the write-up. Now I have two of the same and I really felt duped. I'm very careful these days where I place my money and it should not have happened. Yes, it's forgiveable!"
5,A Deeper Dyer,"I was somewhat astounded when I saw this video. I'd read many of Dr. Dyer's books and attended a live talk many years back. He was always amusing, perceptive, warm and a gifted speaker. In this film, however, he bares his soul to a great depth. The movie is a film within a film and beautifully done. Both direction and editing are superb. The music track is also quite good and the ending song delightful.If you are seeking to go deeper in your own spiritual journey, I highly recommend this one. (I got the deluxe version [two discs] and was fascinated by the interviews and further music.)"
3,A one time movie,"It was not as inspirational as the U Tube clippings made it seem. I did not rewatch it. Like a one time thing or maybe two , sometime. I should have just rented it. I especially did not enjoy the interviews in the deluxe edition. badly made."
5,How can you not get value out of anything Wayne Dyer writes or lectures on?,"A film for growth showing how various troubled relationships are healed by a change in perspective and love.There can be healing and transformation for many by looking at the examples of humans behavior and how they changed their lives to the betterment for themselves and for all.You change one life, you change the world by the ripple effect."
3,Good Message (but boring),"I guess, after watching other ""motivational"" dvd's, I was expecting a bit more from Wayne Dyer. I love his way of getting points across, but I think I've heard most of what he has to say.The high spot (to my mind) was Dom DeLouise'son (Michael).Maybe I should have given a 2 Star rating...but for new people, go for it."
3,The shift of the church,"Money making scheme. While good in principle, any priest or minister could tell you the same things for free and would not be afraid to call God, God."
3,a good primer on Dyer's teachings,"whether you've been a fan of Dyer's for years or just recently, this film easily introduces you to the recent teachings of Dyer's (reminiscent his recent PBS specials).Dyer plays himself in the movie, but this isn't a documentary, but a feature film. He interacts with various characters as they learn to view their life in more spiritual terms.inspirational film....would make a great gift as well to a loved one."
3,I Love Wayne Dyer but he should have received more help on this.,"When I have to pause a video several times throughout the first time viewing well, it means I'm disappointed and not sitting on the edge of my seat, if you know what I mean. Dyer is my favourite speaker, and I've bought all his books. I bought this video because it received quite a build-up from him by way of the preview and Hay House radio. I was really excited to find out if this was something new. It should say on the cover, ""For people just testing the waters of spirituality"". If he had delved into his deeper thoughts more, and cut loose the commentary from the so-called directer and his staff, I would have been leaning into the message. It was just too bland and I wanted more, and I know Dr Dyer has more to give. Perhaps he will try again, and really help by giving us more specifics on how we can help ourselves."
5,A Must See,"This movie is amazing not only because Dr. Wayne W. Dyer experienced his first acting role, but the message is one to be heard by all. A lot of positivity and it was excellent to see him as an actor versus lecturer for a change. Same amazing Dr. Wayne W. Dyer and another wondeful message."
2,Big disappointment......,"Big disappointment......more about self promoting than the ""Shift"" of the world....The Shift....I was expecting something more universal!~....I will donate it to the public library!~"
1,bad quality,Bought the US 12 size. After a month of use the top part got bended and broke off. Very disappointing. I had a size 16 crochet needle that I used for at list 10 years but I lost it and bought this one instead.
1,cheap cheap cheap cheap,"I attempted to use the hook on a slightly delicate knitting project...not only did it keep tearing ALL MY YARN, it also bent within the first 5 minutes which boggled my mind as very little pressure was used. I found much better quality at my local craft store along with better prices. I will be returning his hook shortly."
4,One of the best!,"This book is really catchy. First, Liz wants to do it, then she changes her mind and doesn't do it. Reading books after this, I realize that she made the right choice."
4,"Wonderful, romantic, but what ever happened to Nick?","I think that this book was really great, but what ever happened to Nick? He and Jess are in a wonderful realationship and this book never even mentions his name! Though I love how Jessica stood up for herself. Go Jess! I think that Elizabeth and Tom should have done you know what. Though I admire Elizabeth for being able to control herself and say NO! Wait Tom, just wait. But what the heck with the mysterious illness? Overall, a good book."
2,What happened to Nick Fox????,"What happened to the GORGEOUS Nick Fox?? He and Jessica were meant to be together!! No offence to Elizabeth but she is only good when she is with Jessica and she is not so good whan she is by herself or with Tom. Jessica is truely and naturally, funny and exciting but the what happened to Detective Fox. Its like all of a ssudden he dissappeared. The story never said that he was a ghost and besides romance with Jessica is really funny! To all the readers who like Elizabeth more than Jessica you will like this book more but I like the character of jessica's more."
3,A bit dissapointing,"I think this book was definetely not one of her strongest novels. In my opinion there were alot of holes in the plot(ie:Whatever happened to Nick?)What Tom and Elizabeth were going to do kind of took me by surprise. I wasn't expecting that at all and the mysterious rash Tom has, didn't fit with the whole plot either. This book wasn't all bad because it did have some strong points. I really liked the idea of Jessica and joining that program. Seargeant Pruitt was a witch and of course Jessica is going to beat her-one way or another. :) I think they should of focussed a bit more on Jessica instead of on Tom and Elizabeth."
3,It wasn't that great,"I liked it, but I didn't. Some parts were dumb. I was mad enough when Laurie John kept Elizabeth and Tom from getting together for so long, and I don't want them to break up now. And what the heck is up with a mysterious illness? Give me a break, it sounds like a bad soap opera. But I did like Jessica going to FSSA."
4,This was an eventful book for Elizabeth & Jessica.,"This book has many ups and downs for Elizabeth, but I think it should have evened out the focus on Jessica and Elizabeth instead of mostly on Elizabeth. Jessica is off at at FSSA a secret agent training compund that is giving her trouble. Elizabeth is in New York producing her play on fellowship where Tom is pressuring her into doing something which she doesn't want to. Elizabeth's producer is practically bossing her around and Jessica's seargent is a pain in the butt. Maybe they'll both escape it before their end."
5,Wonderful Shoes,Could not be more pleased with these shoes. My daughter just loved them and they fit her just perfectly. They lasted very well and I would buy them again.
4,good book,this book provides good and understable case studies.reviews the information in textbook.disscuss a lot of real cases using the tools in textbook.
2,Disappointing cheap plastic,"The faux marble finish on the seat is beautiful (we didn't even mind a flaw on the underside- a small reddish streak). We DID MIND the cheap plastic hardware used to fastened the seat down. The seat easily shifted on the bowl because, unlike metal, it wouldn't tighten down. The plastic hinged split after two months! We are not big or heavy people - it was definitely the plastic. We went to our hardware store and bought brass hardware and it works well and the brass complements the marble finish."
4,LOVE IT!,"I LOVE this flat iron! I have very thick, coarse hair that frizzes out no matter what the weather is like outside. This flat iron leaves my hair so soft, silky, and tangle free. I can also do much larger sections of hair that I could with my old flat iron (an imitation one)."
2,Not for Gen 3 Glock 22,"The rear sight would not slide into place on my G3 Glock 22. Since I scratched the side trying to install it, I figured it would not be accepted as a return. I had to sand the bottom until it would fit. With a little red loc tite it has set well. The sites miraculously aligned perfectly and I have now fired 265 rounds through it with no problems. The sites are awesome, but they were advertised for gen 3 Glock 22's, which is wrong."
1,Wrong night sights.,"I bought these for my glock 23 gen 4. These sights are only made for the glock 36, or single stack glocks. They are the trijicon GL 12. I need the GL11, I'm sure you can make them fit your glock, but if i'm spending 80-90 dollars, i'm better off going to glock and buying their night sights that are actually built for my gun."
5,The things of life!,"Without any doubt we are dealing with the masterpiece of Claude Sautet. The friendship is the fit vehicle to express the peaks and lows, gathering the existential living based on disappointments, love affairs, unfinished projects and a promissory career for a boxing prospect.This is a deep and moving film, zealously scripted, overwhelmingly acted and better directed. But Michael Piccoli (a constant choice of Sautet who always represented the figure of the antihero per excellence) in the most demanding role was specially dazzling; on one hand we have the breakthrough of his actual existence as respectable medic respect the questioning young leader in his student years and the particularly tragic destiny of his crumbling marriage.A master film under any angle."
4,Outdoor fun for my boys,My 8 year old and 4 year old are enjoying this cookstove set. They are getting a fort for playing outside and they like to bring this out for their camping adventures.
1,Does not work,"Cute toy, my son likes it, but the stove did not light up or make any sounds after several battery changes - not what I paid for."
3,Cute product,I bought this for my grandkids. It was very noisey. But they did enjoy and it was of good quality.
5,Pretend and Play!,"The Grill & Go Camp Stove is the perfect toy for kids of all ages. It comes with the little grill that lights up and makes real grilling sounds when you add batteries. It also has a coffee pot, frying fan, and several utensils. Willow loves playing with it, and I know its safe for her because there are no small pieces that can detach. Even my older kids love it. The three of them set up a campsite in the living room, and had loads of fun pretending to grill up some hamburgers and hot dogs for their trip. The best thing about it, is that when the kids are all done playing, all the pieces can be stored inside the case so its less likely they will lose all the pieces."
4,It Sizzles!,"I purchased this toy for my 5 year old granddaughter's birthday. It was one of several pretend camping toys that were meant to be played with together. She liked it, but her 6 and 7 year old sisters liked it better. It makes a sizzling or boiling noise. We couldn't figure out how to turn it off, so we just left it alone and it eventually turned itself off. They used it to prepare pretend camper's meals. It's easy to set up (the 7 year old did it) and it has storage in the base for all the equipment which comes with it. The girls enjoyed playing with it. It seemed sturdy enough and made with good quality. I would recommend it."
4,Camping Stove,"Its OK for price I paid - but it would have been a better deal at $20.It is exactly as shown - nothing more or less and the burners flash orange and make a noise - not sure what its supposed to sound like, but the kids like to play with it.Bottom is good for storage but it is not attached to the stove permanently so now the stove tends to be its own thing with a green storage box floating around. Need to find away to hinge on this thing."
1,missleading ad!!!!!,"I, like the other negative reviewer, purchased this item expecting it to be a REAL camp stove. I've just looked again at the ad and sure enough it does not state that this is a toy. Did any of you think that it might be appropriate to have mentioned that? I have no small children to give it to and considering what I got I never would have paid so much for a piece of plastic junk for a child.Thanks a lot. What was Bush's famous line about ""Fool me once, etc."""
1,Problem I just had to deal with,"I can't really review the camping stove, because I didn't receive the stove. I did receive a shipment, but it was a kids' camping gear set instead of a camping stove.Since I needed the present quickly and it went along with the theme of our gifts to our kids (It was a camping gear theme for CHRISTmas - both adults and children), I settled for it. What I received is okay but I was definitly disappointed.Since I decided to ""settle"" for what was received, I did not contact you; but since you asked - I'm informing you of the situation.Thank you, -mendi holt"
2,Small print and bad pictures,"This book is not very user friendly - the pictures are dark and/or blurry and font on the text is too small. Another infuriating thing is that the mechanical pictures are always a few pages away from the text that describes them forcing you to flip back and forth when reading. I like to take workshop manuals out to the garage when working and sometimes place them near the item I'm working but the page flipping just about made that a waste of time. Despite all the layout issues, the book still provides a good amount of technical information and has helped me through several repairs on my TR4a."
2,Nothing Hot About Remakes Of Chili Pepper Classics,I thought that the songs where completely ruined. The only reason to buy this CD is if you are a diehard fan of the Red Hot Chili Peppers like I did. Perhaps the only exception was the Under The Bridge cover.
4,"Good overview, but a bit biased","I thought that this books provided a great overview of the different schools of philosophical thought. However, it did tend to have a bit of a Christian bias. That being said, I still think it is worth a read."
3,Disappointed..,"I am generally not hard to please in regards to dvd picture/audio quality, however, the picture and audio in this set is horrible. I have only started the second disc and have discovered several video disruptions that initially led me to believe I had received a damaged set. After reading the reviews here, apparently this is common.After paying $100 for the set, finding numerous video disruptions AND discovering there are NO complete episodes, I feel like a chump.Buyer beware!"
2,Johnny carson 4 decades of the Tonight Show,"After watching some of these, the reproduction quality is very very poor. Will probably be asking for a refund, or at least a replacement"
3,Somewhat displeased with Johnny Carson,"I thought the Johnny Carson Tonight was going to be like his last with just portions of his shows that were the best. This one had ""entire"" shows on it. They were funny, and good, but I expected that they were going to just be cuts from shows. There were too many monologues. After a while, they get boring. Over all, it was good, but I was disappointed. I also found out by watching the DVD's that so far I've watched 6 DVD's of the set, and DVD #6 with Steve Martin, and Dave Letterman, are freezing on my DVD player. When I put it on my computer, I can see by fast forwarding, where it is getting stuck."
2,LOOKS LIKE THEY RIPPED US OFF AGAIN!!!!!!!,"Well if you look at the detailed listing on TVshowsonDVD.com they show four episodes and 2 hours per disc. That means each episode is cut down to 30 freaking mins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I half expected this. Well , wont be gettin this one now!!"
1,Essentially Just clips,"Sadly, these DVDs present no more than 30 minutes or so of each program. The clips are wonderful, but not complete shows. For complete Tonight Show episodes try googling KineVideo."
2,video quality is compromised in this set,"As others have noted the video quality is indeed an issue. there are many moments in nearly every episode where the video ""pulsates"" for lack of a better term. At first I thought it was my DVD player, or my set, but now that I see others complaining there is indeed a problem. For the money spent I think we deserve more.There are rare moments indeed but be advised:1. These are NOT complete episodes but clipsand2. The video becomes tough to watch at time."
1,Huge Disappointment,"This set was a huge disappointment. As everyone says, these are clips and all the shows are truncated. For some strange reason several guests (Robert Blake, David Brenner) are repeated frequently while Johnny's better and more famous guests never appear at all. Alice Cooper is on but his performance is cut. Another guest receives a buildup but then her interview is cut. There seems to be no logic to the way some of these shows are put together.Don't waste your time or money. This is a rip off packaged in time for the holidays."
2,Why No Chapter Marks?,"How can you release DVD's with no Chapter Marks? 15 discs, Unbelievable, this was a gift otherwise I would send it back. Like mentioned before the quality is not real good but watchable."
2,Product Misleading!,"Grandma bought the Curious George ""DVD"" for my 2 children and their cousin. We popped it in to our DVD player and tried using our DVD remote and it didn't work. I read the package and the box and nowhere does it tell you ""Only for use with the Read With Me Controller"". Even at the Fisher Price website it is not explained very articulately. Apparently you need to purchase a $25 ""system"" (aka-special remote control) that you program to interface with your own home DVD remote control and DVD player."
1,NOT a DVD,"Please be aware that this is not a DVD for use in a DVD player. It is a disc made only for the ""Read with Me DVD Learning System"". This was not clear in the item description and my daughter was in tears when her birthday present wouldn't work. I felt really bad for her and feel mislead."
5,Curiously Good,My 2 year old loves this story. He especially loves how Curious George ends up eating all of the banana cream chocolates. We play this game a lot but not as much as 'Where The Wild Things Are'.
1,JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK JUNK,JUNK! this is why fisher price doesn't make hte toy anymore.Don't waste your money.
4,What the ???,"I've always loved this album, but on this release find the bonus tracks problematic. They are great fun, for instance, ""They Took You Away Once Again."" Lyrics like: ""I got used to sleeping without a gun to my head / and not being locked up in chains / I let all the people in our basement go free / and I've given all your knives to the Salvation Army"" made me laugh out loud. Then there's the rather icky incest song ""The Ring"" (icky even by incest song standards, though the only other that comes to mind is Buffy St. Marie's eponymous one.) So how seriously are we meant to take any of this? Not too, I'd guess, but it does throw up a distracting dissonance, rather like the Keystone Kops crashing a Merchant Ivory film. Still, an all-time favorite."
3,Songs for a Sultry Saturday Night,"There's a certain sameness to the songs in that slow,smokey,melancholy way, but the emotion in Paula Frazier's voice gives the material a very authentic feel. And if you're kicking back with your baby on a Saturday night, you'll never find a better slow-dance song than ""Two Wrongs Won't Make Things Right""."
3,try!?!?!,"the rest in pieces is a way to get to know saliva so you try itgive them a chance see whut they got! how about it.then if you like them you whould staind , Godsmack, Disturbed,snot, marilyn manson,well you get the ****** point try it."
3,Phantom of the Opera,"Pretty mediocre at best. Most of the songs are too slow (compared to the orginal cast recording)and do not always stay on tempo, and the people they have doing the vocals are not very good. Some of them are downright bad.I also have a sheet music book for all the songs on this CD, written by Andrew Lloyd Wbber himself, and some of the music on this CD does not even match what is written in my book.That said, it's decent enough if you just intend to use it for fun (which most people probably do), but if you actually want to learn the song for performance purposes, I would probably recommend an accompanist instead. Unfortunately, there really are no other Phantom karaoke CDs out there, but this one is far overpriced for the quality of it."
1,Piece of garbage!!!!,"I would give this item negative stars if I could. Pure and simple, the compass did not work. No matter which way I faced, it would show SW. I tried standing next to a strong magnet, and it STILL didn't react. I wasted $10 on this... please don't make the same mistake I did"
3,compass,"I'm finding this works great everywhere except in the car and that is where I wanted it. I can shake it and hold it away from the dash and by doing that, it works pretty good."
2,No adjustment,"The compass comes with compensating adjustment screws but they had no effect on needed compensation.Before you think it was my vehicle I want to say that I had ,for several years, a compass that was the same make and model as the new one.The one that I just ordered had all the same features but they didn't work.So back it went.Amazon took care of everything and all went well.I still don't have a working compass so I have to use my GPS."
1,Money wasted,Wasted money. Adjustement wheels do not function and are loose. Compass cannot be adjusted no matter where i put it in the car. Can only be used as a paper weight
5,Traveler Compass,"I like having a old fashion compass in my truck that works and this one does , and does not take up a lot of space yet is easy to read"
1,Dissapointment,"This compass is too fragile for being used in an automobile. It is constantly getting stuck and not following the magnetic field and keeping it level on hillsides is not possible so it is usually inaccurate there. Probably good for a flat city, but if you are going into the boonies be careful. I am going to seek out a replacement."
5,A great addition to my new travel truck,"Drove 3060 miles in my new Tundra and with all the detours in NY, Penn and etc got lost several times. Added the compass fri quick decisions in heavy traffic and quick detours. Great addition to my truck."
3,So So Compass,"I bought this and the jumbo boat compass (shown elsewhere) for my boat.This compass does not have the large yellow North seeking arrow that is always apparent. As one looks directly at the compass, one sees the direction in which one is headed.However, the yellow north seeking arrow of the other compass is much preferred.Both are 'portable'."
4,Works Great On Quad,"So far it holds well on my Sportsman 500 quad. The pivoting arm works great and can adjust at many angles. I am using it on my quad in case the batteries in the GPS conk out. Sometimes its easier to use these dumb down compasses instead of electronic gizmos because they are convenient, always on and fast."
1,junk!,I'm always going north or west- work for the 1st few weeks and now doesnt work at all- don't waste your money!
2,Customer Comment,"This is a cute and robust compass for travellers.It is a good and reliable product.I fixed it on my front dashboard.When I was driving around urban area or countryside, I used to get lost and no idea where I am going.Then, I need to look at this compass to find outwhere I am heading to. This small compass helps me a lot.The only small imperfection of this product isit does not turns promptly or sometime it even stucks atone pointing when the car makes many quick turns inshort period on bumpy road.Anyway,It is a good stuff........"
1,"If north is south, then this compass works well.","It works pretty well at aligning itself to north-south axis. However, its north is pointing in the opposite of what it is supposed to be. Adjustment thumbwheels don't work at all. Very very disappointed in BELL. Do NOT recommend buying. Luckily, I am able to return this item free of shipping charge. Amazon rules!"
5,Samsung SWA-3000 Wireless Surround Sound Amp.,"Works great, sounds great!The only catch is that it's not really ""wireless"". The only advantage this product provides is that you don't need wires going across the room from the reciever to the back speakers. You still need wires for all the speakers.So, a little expensive just to prevent wires going across the room, but the sound is great, and it's fairly easy to set up.I was completley satisfied overall w/ this product!"
5,Samsung SWA-3000 Wireless Module,"I love this product. It has Great Sound! As if the rear speakers were hooked right up to the Samsung Surround Home theater itself. I love the fact that there are no wires running along the edges of your room to the rear speakers. You simply connect your rear speakers to The wireless receiver which communicates through radio frequencies with The Samsung Home theater system you already have or are going to buy separate. It comes with SWA-3000 amplifier unit, TX card, AC power adapter, and user's manual. It is VERY EASY to install. Just insert the TX card, plug in the receiver, connect rear speakers and your ready to go.The first Movie we Played was ""Top Gun"", ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS SOUND! you will enjoy!"
2,disappointing,I guess i should have known that streaming music wirelessly was not going to produce fantasic sound. I sort of expected that but i'm no audiophile so I figured I would not notice the difference. wrong!. You'll hear a lot of hissing on the speakers when you use this deivce.It clearly ruins the experience. save yourself the money and go wire-up all the speakers. Yes that may look uglier but it would sound a lot better.
2,Not what I expected,"Was disappointed in that I thought all the speakers would be wireless, you can only separate the front from rear and still need wires between them. Also had fidelity problems - hissing and low volume;ended up sending them back - no problem with that though."
2,Not What I Thought,"I thought this product would allow me to have my 2 rear speakers used wirelessly. Unfortunately, that isn't the case, your speaker wires plug into this and your speakers, and it is wireless to the receiver. At any rate, had to send it back anyway because it wouldn't link up several times, and waiting for it to return. Hope it works, Samsung customer service is better than expected. If this is what you want, it should be good I just expected something else and got a lemon to boot."
2,SWA-3000,the wireless module is not totally wireless and the performance is not what I expected from the unit ...If I was to buy it againg I would think of twice before purchasing ..I was not totally satisfied with the performance ...Still is better then nothing...
4,works as advertised,"Works great. Installed for an older samsung DVD/receiver combo that supported, but did not come with the wireless module.Setup was easy and quick and audio quality is very good. There is a slight hissing sound from the speakers when there is not an active audio signal, but it's hardly noticable unless the speaker is pointed directly at your ears."
2,Hardly Ever Works,"I use this in conjunction with a Samsung Home Theater system. However, this hardly ever works. Nearly every time i turn on the system, the receiver does not respond, and i have to remove and reinsert the SD card module in the back of the theater for the wireless station to operate. Huge hassle."
2,not impressed,"these boots have heels that are too high. I can barely walk in them and they feel very unstable. The sole is not too flexible and they keep my feet cold. Otherwise they look good and the leather is nice and soft. Definitely not shoes one can wear all day long. Also, they seem to run somewhat bigger."
2,Very disappointed with this book,"The reproduction of the drawings were halftone photographs rather than line drawing reproduction. Very disappointed in the quality,,especially compared to the Mort Drucker book."
2,Somewhat Disappointing,"Disappointing television movie about a group of girls who follow Tottenham during the ""Double"" of '61. The football aspect of the plot is incidental- the action focuses more on the melodrama in the girls' world. Alright, but not very deep."
4,A Book That Tells You Not to Ignore Whatever Your Parents Tell You,"When I was very young, I didn't see why a child needed a parent or guardian to tell him/her what to do. I eventually found out that when you disobey a grown up (i.e., if you're a child), you would need a punishment. In this book, Heidi disobeyed her father by eating candy before dinner. Her father didn't want her to eat candy before dinner because he thought it would steal her appetite. The third to last page said you mustn't lie when you disobey because you would get into even bigger trouble. I think when Heidi disobeyed her father about the candy, she felt it was bad enough that she disobeyed and therefore told the truth. Because Heidi disobeyed about the candy, she didn't get to eat the rest of it. In the very end, both her mother and father felt proud of her for understanding why anybody should listen to others that don't want them to do a bad thing or avoid something helpful."
1,"All shame, no skills",This book is all about shame and doesn't help children learn any skills whatsoever. It was uncomfortable and distasteful to read. It seems that the goal here is to produce compliant children who take no responsibility for their own actions. Keep looking for a more positive take on forming relationships.
5,So much fun!,"I have these cups for my seven month old and he loves them! I'm not sure why babies find cups so entertaining, but they absolutely do! He loves to bang them together and chew on them! I love that these cups are educational too. They are all numbered in English, Spanish and French. Plus, they all have animals on them. All and all a great product!"
2,Not very useful,My kids use this in the sandbox. Not a good learning toy but they use it to put toys in.
2,still guilty,"An interesting book because of its author; a convicted murderer. Marshall and his late sister did a good job with the writing, but fail to answer too many questions. Why Marshall spent thousands supposedly hiring private investigators from Louisiana to check on missing money in his Harrah's account, something which is central to the story, is never really cleared up. Nor does he address why even his two eldest sons concluded that he was guilty -- not by itself proof of guilt, but worth wondering about. As literature and as debate material, ultimately disappointing."
1,Not very likely,"If Rob Marshall is innocent in the death of his wife then he is the most unlucky man on earth. I mean what are the odds that a man from Lousiana,a man Marhall had sent large chunks of money to, would just happen to be in a deserted park in New Jersey after dark when Marshall just randomly pulled in there because of ""tire"" trouble. And then this Louisiana guy gives Marshall a little bump on the head and kills his sleeping wife for no apparent reason. Its just a little hard to believe, don't you think. I would like to see some of those crime solving psychics take a look at this case, and Scott Peterson and Jeffrey McDonald, and see what conclusion they come to."
1,Laughable,"I'm innocent! The universal cry of all men (and women) on death row. Or, ""ok, the evidence was videotaped and witnessed by six nuns, so NOW I'VE FOUND JESUS so don't kill me.""This man takes chutzpah to a new level. Everybody's soooo mean to him. Those nasty old prosecutors and cops who followed the evidence right to his smarmy door.The man is guilty and turns and twists to hard to try to wiggle out that this book needs a chiropractor."
3,It's not a bad book; just remember the narrator is unreliable,"There are two issues -- Am I glad I read this book? Yes. Is Marshall's story believable? No.The latter issue first. Here's the giveaway: When you are wrongly convicted of your wife's murder and have spent years in jail, you really don't indulge what are apparently still-pleasant memories of your mistress right in the beginning of the book. His wife was brutally murdered, and he can't wait to tell us about his mistress.Now, is it a bad book? No. It's well-organized, not badly written, and shows the mind of a murderer. Really, it's worth a read."
3,falls apart easily,"My 5yr old son got this for his birthday, he loves it but it falls apart so easily that its frustrating to play with. We are superglueing it together tonight!!!"
2,Don't waste your money,My son got this gift for his birthday I put it together which was not easy!! the set fell apart after about ten minutes of my son playing with it.I will try and screw the thing together if at all possible.
2,Buy some superglue first... that or major in architecture,"My son loves this toy but he takes it apart and can't put it together again. The problem is neither can I. Seriously, it's nuts that it's sold for 3 year olds. By the time they'd be interested and skilled enough to put it together, they'd more likely be 12+ years old (this is worse than a model airplane!)... and would've moved onto cooler things."
5,Roaring Fun,My son LOVES this toy. He has a few of the other dinosaurs that go with it. This is one of his favoeites
3,Great Belch!,Took a bit longer to put together than I had originally thought - but I took it as a compliment to my IQ and manual dexterity the fact that I was able to figure it out at all. The T-Rex belch is the best thing about it! Laughter rolls from my 3-year-old whenever he pushes the belch button. Doesn't fall apart as some reviewers have stated. Just have to make sure all connections are secure and not toss it around.
3,disappointed in set-up,"Although my son loves to play with this toy, it is very disappointing to see it falls apart very easily. It is durable with respect to each piece, but the overall design is poor, because he does not have to play rough for it to come apart."
1,Falls Apart ALOT!!!,"My Husband and I just bought this toy for our son's 6th Birthday, we thought it looked like such a neat toy for him to have, we bought all the dinosaurs and accessories for it also. Our son LOVE'S Dinosaurs!! It took my husband about 20 minutes to get it together, and about 10 minutes for it to fall apart! My son tried to move it to his bedroom and didn't even get it off the ground when all 3 levels came apart! The plants and everything fall right off, and it in NO way snaps together or anything! If you barely touch the thing it falls apart. My son was SO excited to get it put together so he could play with it, now he is afraid to touch it because it falls apart and we are ALL tired of putting it back together. I feel it is very poorly made and I wouldn't spend the money on it again. I am going to buy some super glue and see if I can get it to stay together that way. Although we do Love the Imaginext toys, this one gets two thumbs down!"
2,T Rex Mountain,"We got this for out 5 year old son who is a dinosaur fanatic. He has most of the dinosaurs to go with it. He hardly ever plays with the mountain because it won't stay together. The idea to be able to reconfigure it is great, but the pieces keep coming apart. My son loves the dinosaurs and plays with them all the time, but not the mountain."
3,T-Rex fell down the mountain,The figures in this set are cool but the mountain itself comes apart too easily. My son (4) is frequently asking me to put it back together again. He hasn't played it in awhile and a friend of his took it apart and now I don't remember how it goes back together again. I know it's made to be interchange able but it still be sturdier.
2,disappointed,My son wanted this sooo badly for Christmas. It was really his only request. He is 4 and loves dinosaurs. It was a real disappointing when it fell apart within 5 minutes of playing with it. We put it back together and it was apart in a couple of minutes again. Basically it has been in a pile ever since. Once he got part of it out to be a dock for his pirate ship.
2,keeps falling apart,"I bought this toy for my 4year old son's birthday. He has all the dinosaurs, so I thought this would be great, but it keeps falling apart. I definitely agree with the person who said it is better left on the table and for older kids. My son does like playing with it though when it stays together."
1,It Won't stay together,"This toy is a great concept. It allows the child to build the system and then play with it. The problem is, that once your child spends an hour building it, it quickly falls apart once they begin playing with it. We have not been successful in keeping it together and it has been frustrating for all of us."
1,Horrible craftsmanship!,"It falls apart if you TOUCH it. The head is too heavy for the top and constantly makes it tip over, or it falls off on its own and takes a myriad of other pieces with it. There isn't a SINGLE piece that actually stays where it should once a child touches it. My 3 1/2 year old loves the dinosaurs and sound effects of this toy and will play with the pieces while waiting for Mommy to help him put it back together again - which is time consuming and frustrating because it will only go right back to the pile of junk it was to begin with as soon as it is touched. You'd be better off going to the dollar store and buying a can of 12 plastic dinosaurs - those are the only things your child will be able to touch if you buy this anyway."
3,T-Rex Mountain Review,This is a wonderful toy. It takes some time to put together. It is NOT stable. It easily comes apart. My 6 year old daughter really enjoys it. She has changed the setup several times. I just wish that had better quality!
3,ALOT OF PEICES,"This toy takes awhile to put together, and doesn't stay together very well. My boys love it, but it is a pain to re-assemble after each play."
1,fun but not durable,"My son loves to play with this toy, however it falls apart. I tried crazy glue and that did not work. Now I used a hot glue gun. This has worked OK, but for what you pay you should not have to figure out how to keep it together, that is the comapnies job. I would have returned this toy, but we through the box away Christmas morning. Cute concept, but I think the company needs to re-think the configuration."
3,Just for FYI..,"I have just purchased this toy and have not yet given it to my children, however, my boys have several of the Imaginext sets and just about all the reviews I read on this item holds true for them as well. The Imaginext Systems are much sturdier and stay together more easily IF you follow the original intructions that comes with each one. This however does not stop my boys from hours of play! They love them! I agree with the person that said that table play is best. This holds true for all the Imaginext Systems. Just my opinion! I am actually excited for Christmas day so we can put together this awesome toy and Im 30 years old!! LOL"
4,My four year old son loves this toy!,"It was the only thing he really wanted for Christmas and he has been very happy with his choice! I, on the other hand, wasn't as thrilled. This thing took me an hour to assemble and his little friend all of five minutes to destroy... but I put it back together and it hasn't come apart since. It stays assembled in his bedroom and is still his favorite toy! This was our first experience with Imaginext and we will continue to buy their toys. I recommend it if your child likes dinosaurs.. it is very cute."
1,BAD TOY FOR KIDS - not worth the trouble,"My 5 year old son wated this toy very badly. I searched for it at Christmas and had to order it at our local TOys R US becasue it was the HOT toy. I wish I had read the other reviews to see how bad the toy was.It does not stay together. aS soon as my son touches it, it falls apart. It took over and hour to put together and seconds to fall apart. I called FIsher Price and complained and they said ""they knew of the problem"" and sent me extra pieces to hold it together. They do not work. It still falls apart. My son has not played wiht this $[...] toy sicne a week after Christmas. He hates it! The Mordrids castle is the same.ADVICE: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!"
4,My 6yr.old son loves this toy!!!!,"We just had my sons 6 yr.birthday party for him. He loves this dinosaur imaginext set. He has several other imaginext sets,but this one seems to top the list. I think it looks pretty durable. I was hesitant to buy it after reading some of the reviews,but i'm really glad I decided to get it for him. It's great!!"
1,Falls apart too easy,"I bought this for my son at Christmas. He was 5 months away from 4 years and in love with dinosaurs. This toy falls apart way too easy. You constantly have to rebuilt it even with gentle play. I realize the pieces are designed for this feature, however, it becomes frustrating to the child who just wants to play. The pieces are fun to play with as well as the dinosaurs, however, I will not continue to add to this collection and will hot glue it together."
3,It spends more time in pieces.......,"I think I put it together every day, and every day it ends up in pieces. The parts aren't breaking, they just don't stay together. The Dino head piece is very top-heavy and falls off the first time they play with it. Most times the head just gets carried around and used as a friend to the other accessories. :)"
2,Unstable - Falls to pieces!,"I recommended my mother-in-law get this toy for my son for Christmas. It's not cheap, so now I feel bad because he never plays with it because it falls apart whenever he or his friends try to play with it. He's good at putting things together (he's almost 5) but it's a challenge for even an adult because it falls apart as you're trying to put it together. My son used to see this in its glass case in the toy departments and wanted it SO BAD - now I know why they keep it in a glass case - because it falls apart as soon as you touch it! It's frustrating and it's a choice I regret."
2,"neat idea, but not so neat overall","Santa got this for our almost 5 year old son. At first he was thrilled with his new toy... the burping dino is pretty cool! However, it was a challenge to assemble for us adults. Our son cannot assemble this himself at all and it falls apart constantly. The idea of being able to disassemble and reassemble is wonderful, if only it actually worked that way. A challenging and frustrating toy and not worth the hassle or the money. If only we knew before Christmas!"
2,Terrible construction,"I got this for my 3 year old sond and it falls apart so easy, it is so not worth the money. They only thing my boy likes is the sound effects."
3,Pass me the super glue,"My 4 year old son loves this toy. However, don't pick it up or have one of the dinosaurs run into it, it will fall apart. The directions said ONE time assembly. One time if you use Super Glue that is. I am somewhat dissapointed in Fisher Price with this toy. I have several FP toys and none that fall apart like this. I should have read this comment page before buying it. All in all I'm glad I bought it but I think I might just try the glue."
2,Not Stable!,This toy looks great in the box. My son and nephew were both very excited when they saw it in the store. My son received it for Christmas and after about 20 minutes I decided this was definitely going into the give-away pile. The different levels and sections do not stay together very well. Even as I was putting it together it would fall apart. With very light play the sections came apart. My nephew was still enamored with it so I gave it to him. My sister said she'll probably glue the sections together. Hopefully that will help.
3,GOOD,"This is the second I've read in the series.I believe it's more aimed at women than men.The story was good, the main characters good, secondary characters not well -developed."
3,The Venus Fix,"This book was just ok to me. I really couldn't connect with the charachters. There were many and sometimes didn't know how was telling the story. The subject was interesting, just wish the main people were just a little more real, I mean the doctor was so disconected from every thing and everybody. I was sent a copy of this book to review and would never bought it for myself, just because I usually steer clear of books with porn in them, but this book was not overly explecit. The ending was very good, and it did keep you guessing who did it. I gave it 3 stars, it could have been better, but still was not a bad read."
5,The Venus Fix,"Great easy read. Would recommend this for anyone who enjoys a good crime novel with a little romance. After reading the first one, I had to continue reading the series."
3,the book was okay,First let me say this book was really not my cup of tea. Since I was given the book.for a review I read it.I did enjoy the side story about Ms Snows personal life and that is what kept me reading the book.She is trying to help her clients with their Internet sex addiction. Her personal life was interesting tryingto raise her 13 year old daughter. Ms Snow has a boyfriend she wants to get closed to but is scaredHer daughter wants her back with her father.It was good and I did finish it
5,Kudos for The Dog Who Sang at the Opera,"This is a great story with beautiful illustrations. Funny, charming, and entertaining for both children and adults. I bought this book for my 73 year old father who has a love of the opera and dogs. He loved it!"
1,Legends in their own minds,"It is a rivalry, but it's not the only one nor is it the best one. There many others, but to hear the Chapel Hill or Durham fanatics, it's the only one that has ever existed. What happened to Michigan and Michigan State or Purdue and Indiana or Berkeley and Stanford or Miami and Florida, for example?One gets tremendously tired of prima donna coaches like Dean Smith or Mike Krzyzewski, who profit enormously while denying their players any of the loot, or of thug and pampered ""student""-athletes who are not, and cannot, be real students, to get very excited about any of it. Get a life, guys, and quit sniffing jocks."
4,Great Book!,"Great book so far; GO HEELS!I'm reading about the invention of the Four Corners Offense. To my understanding, it was John McClendon who actually invented the offense. McClendon was a fellow Kansas alum, and later coached at NC Central, which is in Durham. I'm a bit disappointed that the author didn't include this bit of history..."
4,Tar Heel Sports History Revealed,"Blue Blood: Duke-Carolina by Art Chansky was requested by my husband for Christmas. He is really enjoying this book and even reads it aloud to me when some amazing facts unknown to us about Carolina and Duke are noted. We both have gleaned some very interesting information, laughed at funny situations and marveled at the actions of the people written about. Most all Carolina fans will truly enjoy reading and owning this book. Duke fans and other ACC schools can also experience the history and lore of these two great college basketball rivals!!!"
5,For any basketball fan!,"If you appreciate college basketball at all (not just UNC, Duke, or the ACC) you will love the historical presentation of this great rivalry. Most fans will recall the recent events; the strength of this book is the story telling of all the past events that made and shaped this great rivalry."
4,I feel gay for reviewing this.,"For anyone who has ever found himself the parent of exactly ten thousand children, this is the book for you. You can name all of them with little trouble.Or, if you're like I am and want to be a writer, this book is a great tool for finding names for your characters that fit them thematically. (Hagan is a strong defense. Claire is a symbol of light.)The book is decently organized, simply arranged, and easy to use. I recommend it."
5,The title says it all,"In a season of political books that are little more than screeds suffused with unsupported opinions and absent of any rigorous intellectualism, Reich's book is a welcome relief. The difference is in the title. Instead of arguing his positions from unexamined presuppositions, Reich uses reason to lay out his beliefs on how this country could be better run. Whether you agree or disagree with his view that both parties have shifted the nation to far to the right and lost sight of the beliefs of the voters, this makes for thought-provoking reading."
2,A Glimpse Into the Liberal Mind,"This book made me cry. My tears were not because I realized the evil of my conservative ways, or that at long last the ""truth"" about conservatives were revealed. It made me cry because an educated and intelligent man allows himself to become deluded in perhaps one of the most breathtakingly ugly attacks on fellow Americans I have ever read. Reich's hopes for liberalism might be noble and true, but they are poisoned by a hatred of conservatives that is utterly inexplicable.That does not mean the book is hopeless, for example when Reich confines himself to the economy and economic policies that should be pursued he does fine. All in all I have little doubt that this book offers the oportunity to glimpse at the world as many liberals see it, and I do not doubt that they believe what they see; perhaps that by itself is the most disturbing aspect of the book."
5,what is really means to be liberal,"RR discusses what it really means to be liberal and why the radical conservative right simply doesn't get it. The RadCons as Reich calls NeoCons, do their best to paint liberal as 60s throwbacks, totally ignoring the realities of liberalism in the 80s, 90s and today.The awful truth is that NeoCons _want_ big government. And they want your grandkids to pay for it. They just want it to enforce morality rather than ""promote the general welfare"" as stated as a purpose of government in the preamble of the constitution. And while the rant morality, they wish to do nothing about immoral acts of say Ken Lay, Frank Qaudrone and the like.If you've bought the Faux News view that liberal means more taxes and 60s hedonism, you should read this book."
5,Enlightening,"This book provides the reader with a complete understanding of today political environment and the related deception of the status quo. This would be a great read for those who depend upon the main stream media for thier political information which is about 90% tripe.A must read for the Liberal, Progressive, and Conservative."
3,Not very memorable,"Not very memorable, honestly, even though I'm a staunch liberal myself. Pick it up if you want a bit of light reading that agrees with your political views, but if that's not your cup of tea, you may want to pass on this."
2,A disappointing book in most aspects....,"I fully agree with the comments of ""Collector"". To be a useful reference/guide book for the general collectors, techniques on how to distinguish authentic and new reproductions are of great importance. But this book obviously fails to do so. Besides, offering a reference price for the collectibles are always misleading in particular for the volatile cultural revolution relics market. A ""star"" system according to the rarity of the items would be much more useful in this respect. If you are not interested in collecting CR relics, you may still buy this book to enjoy its colorful pictures though. No harm at all but no gain either!"
3,Cultural Revolution - China,"I have for many years been collecting Mao memorabilia, however there is so little information available on what was available or the value of the items. This book is the only one I ever came accross this so much information and pricing. Well documented, good descriptions and pictures."
5,Thoughtful Cup of Joy,"Champagne for the Soul: Celebrating God's Gift of JoyChampagne For The Soul is an excellent treatise of Joy and from where it emanates. The brief chapters, though numbering 90, are brief and to the point. I will never look at Jot in the same way. It is not something one strives to obtain, it comes with surrender of our whole being to our Lord. The freedom in Christ Jesus is Joy that lasts not for the moment but for an eternity!"
5,Great Boots,These boots are great. Love the style. They are pretty easy to walk in too-a little stiff but Im sure I just need to break them in. Seller great also-would buy from again.
4,Worth getting,"A nine piece band run through some Jazz classics. Funjii Mama is a Blue Mitchell tunewith a caribbean feel which the band do really well. Theres a classy arrangement of Gil Evans Gone and the CD starts with a swinging version of Lester Leaps In.The musicians are all excellent, with Henry Lowther on Trumpet and Tom Cawley on Piano being my favourites. Frank Griffith plays Tenor Sax and occasionally some swinging Clarinet.My only minor criticism is the Piano sound. I suspect this was digital keyboard and it sounds a bit 'dead'. I may be wrong, and it certainly doesn't stop Tom Cawley (a British Pianist) from playing with his usual invention.The nine piece line-up is quite unusual, but does allows for some big band type arrangements, and time for the soloists to take more than just a chorus each.This is a CD thats well worth getting."
5,Plastic,"Plastic Is the best instrumental CD I've bought in years!!! Great songs, cool arrangements and THE craziest solo's I've heard in some time. Do your self a favor and buy it."
1,A struggle for my son to use,"I don't recommend this nipple because my son had a struggle sucking out of it. I poked holes in this thing to help get more air in it, but the nipple material just wasn't cut out for it."
1,A third-grader could write a better book...,"I purchased this book after a friend recommended it. Let me just say she is no longer a friend. Ted Schredd might love life but he clearly hates taking the time to learn how to write. Not only that, but the story is lacking. Here it is in a nutshell, but written better...A guy rides his bicycle with a girl he just met. He cheats on her and finds another girl. The two of them then continue the odyssey and and beg anybody and everybody for: a) a place to stay, free of charge b) meals, free of charge c) bicycle equipment and support, free of charge. The end. I rated this book 1 star, but only because Amazon.com doesn't have a ZERO star rating."
4,An intriguing take on old christmas carols,"I first fell in love with this album because of ""Carol Of The Bells"", it is the first version of this song I have heard use actual heavy bells. The album is rather gothic and dark but is true to the sentiment of these songs. The playlist is very well done and offers a unique perspective that is truly relaxing."
2,A waste of time and of money,"This book is indeed a collection of ""mental gymnastics of a particularly depraved sort"" (see the preface of the book), and one ought to wonder how can economists even concieve calling macroeconomics what is written in this textbook- a set of models based on dynamic equations and systems, calculus of variations, and optimal control theory. What does this have to do with reality? Nothing. It does not at all further one's knowledge of economics, it only forces you to perform the same(depraved)mental gymnastics the authors did."
1,Trash,"Don't waste your money!! Cheap plastic with poor workmanship! The first time I tried to clean a disk the little handle came off in my hand..The free UMD cases that came with it are nice, but not worth the money."
1,Not Recommended,"I would not recommend this book. I am a 5th grade teacher and one of my students checked out this book. The parent returned it to the school office out of concern. It is on a 4th grade reading level, but it contains many vulgar words and talks about sex, condoms, AIDS, etc. The book has since been taken off of our school library shelf. I would NOT recommend for any age."
1,Not Recommended,"I am a 5th grade teacher and one of my students checked out this book from the library. The parent returned the book to our school principal out of concern. It is on a 4th grade reading level. It not only contains vulgar language, but it also talks about sex, condoms, HIV, etc. This book has since been taken off the shelf of our school library. I would NOT recommend."
4,Great Movie - Inaccurate History,"Entertaining film, well worth the time. But Hollywood history. To begin with Sparticus was a Roman not a Thracian. Marcus Licineus Crassus trapped Sparticus in the Toe of Italy, not the Heel. Pompey ""The Great"" (The ""Great"" part not mentioned in the film) returned from Spain where he had helped defeat a Roman rebel named Quintus Sertorius, by the land route through France, not by sea. Also, there was no such thing as ""The Garrison of Rome"". But again a fun film and a classic."
5,Absolutely powerful classic,This movie affected me like very few have. I was so distraught by the ending of this movie. Not because it was poorly written or poorly acted but because it was supremely written and acted. For a fan of true classics this should be in your top ten. Douglas gives his best performance. Highly recommend.
1,spartacus 50th anniversary ed. blu ray,"A great movie. However, a very terrible transfer to blu ray. Now I know why it was on sale for $7.5o a best-buys. Read the amazon reviews of any blu ray movie you might want to buy, and you will find out if the blu ray transfer is any good, or not.There needs to be some sort of govt. agency to check these movies out before these movie companies put more crap on the market. It seems these movie companies are out just for a buck, and there is know way for us to get our cash back when they try to pass junk off on us."
4,Superior Gladiator film,"By no means a perfect film this is still vastly superior to Gladiator in every sense; Douglas, Laughton, Olivier and Ustinov all give indelible performances in roles written for rounded three dimensional characters. For those bored by this well that reflects more on your own lack of intellect than anything else. The sets, not a computer generated image in sight, are lavish and authentic without being slavish to detail. The fight scenes are well choreographed, again without effects making them obviously fake. The genuine atmosphere gives the production a soul totally absent from Gladiator. Whilst the ending is too much, Simmons holding up his son to the dying Spartacus, it does not compare to Scott's ludicrous finale. All in all a fine film."
5,The Best Kubrick Film Ever,"The movie Spartacus amazed me, not because of the visuals or that Kirk Douglas stars, but that it is a Stanley Kubrick film. I don't consider him a genious, but definately a great director. There are a few graphic scenes in it that were very realistic, this is kind of rare for 1960. Unfortunately this movie did not recieve the best picture Oscar, that went to The Apartment that year starring Jack Lemmon. On an even better note, The Criterion Collection's release of this film is great, containing much more than the original Universal release. This Criterion DVD takes you much beyond the movie including deleted scenes, making of, storyboards and many more things that probably took a long time for them to track down. This is definately in my top 25 of all time."
5,"SPARTACUS, SPARTACUS","In my opinion, Spartacus is one of the best epic films that has ever been made. I was also pleased with the non-Hollywood ending. If you enjoy action movies or older history movies I highly recommend Spartacus.The historical accuracy of the film is somewhat questionable But that does not make this movie any less a classic. Kirk Douglass performance as Spartacus is incredible."
2,Warning for quality buffs...,"I love this film and it was one of my first choices when deciding what to purchase for my new DVD collection. Here is a warning: the quality of the video is dismal on this version of the DVD. When reading the other reviews I had to check my version to make sure it was the right one. First of all the DVD encoding is jittery and interspersed with coding artifacts throughout the film. The quality is similar to a movie taped from TV onto a well worn VHS tape. The poor encoding is immediately noticeable when compared to my other DVD purchases like Ben Hur or Gone with the Wind. In addition, this DVD is not a two disk set. My two star rating is purely based on the reproduction quality since I still consider this one of the greatest movies ever made."
5,Classic Gladiator,"One critic thought there were several Spartacus characters. Those that said they were Spartacus didn't really mean that was their name. The reason they said they were Spartacus is so the real Spartacus would not be executed. It's called loyalty, not duplicate names. Check the credits. How many played Spartacus?This film even compared to todays greats like Braveheart and Gladiator holds its own. A must have for any classic movie collector. You won't go wrong buying this DVD. The restoration is excellent, and the cast, sets, and music are incredible. In one scene we see the armies marching into postion from a hillside and the view is spectacular. The arena fight scenes are still great to watch even after seeing recent special effects in movies like Gladiatior. You feel you are there at the height of the Roman Empire. The love scenes between Spartacus and Varinia are well done. Good entertainment for all but the very young."
3,"Occasionally effective, but hardly a masterpiece.","Kirk Douglas stars as Spartacus, the Thracian slave who leads a massive rebellion against the Roman empire. One of Stanley Kubrick's earlier films, this is an occasionally rousing epic with well-choreographed action sequences and grand speeches. Unfortunately, the forest sets reek of cheapness, dialogue ranges from witty to supremely awful, and most of the performances are perfunctory and wooden. Recommended for those seeking a large-scaled epic, but this movie certainly hasn't aged well."
5,Marvelous!,"This movie made me cry. And I'm not kidding. Spectacular war epic, romance, and docu-drama."
2,"Good movie, bad transfer","It should be noted that the reviews on this page refer to two different versions of the Spartacus DVD. This review refers to the Universal single disc edition, not the Criterion two-disc release.While both versions of the film are the same, this version is devastated by a bad transer: both sound and picture quality are seriously lacking - even as far as a blue edge to blacks, including the widescreen matting, and blue fades in parts of the film. The sound is poorly balanced - voices are too quiet, music too loud. I was contantly turning the volume up and down throughout. So much for ""fully restored.""If you are interested in quality and really like this movie I would skip this version and go for the Criterion release, which many other people own and have approved."
1,"great movie, TERRIBLE blu-ray","Great movie. Horrible, horrible blu-ray. Maybe the worst blu-ray disc I've seen. Do not buy, wait for a recall. It's so blatantly awful even non-cinephiles will notice.Here's the main problem: most all the film grain and fine detail have been completely wiped out in a clumsy attempt to remove video noise. Which begs the question: so what's the point of owning it on blu-ray?What's worse is that it didn't have to be this way. But I guess this is what happens when an indifferent media conglomerate has complete control over a masterpiece. Check out Robert Harris's (the man who restored the film years ago) extremely negative review of this blu-ray on the web. I thought maybe he was overdoing it a bit, but no. It's even worse than he says. If you have the Criterion DVDSpartacus - Criterion Collection, just hang on to it for now."
4,Not bad,"My kids & I watched it for a history project. It was factual but not overly gruesome. The love story was done tastefully & you still didn't have to wonder what happened. I'm not one for older movies & my kids were definitely not interested, but after the movie (3+ hours) ended, they both said ""not bad""."
5,This movie is awesome!,"Spartacus, born a slave and raised a slave, is a great movie based on the novel by Howard Fast. Starring: Kirk Douglas, Tony Curtis, Jean Simmons, Laurence Olivier, and Charles Laughton. Rated: PG-13. Director: Stanley Kubrick"
5,Favorite Classic Movie,Bought this for my husband as a surprise gift & he just loves it.Quick delivery; perfect condition. A real Hollywood Spectacular Production.
5,Spartacus,"There have been many Spartacus movies made but, I don't think you Can beat this Spartacus movie with Kirk Douglas. I think the scene where Douglas and the black man fight to the death is one of the best of this type of Rome fighting scenes every made. The movie was very clear and sharp and I enjoy watching it over and over."
4,sprawling kubrick opus,"though kubrick didn't have too much to add to this movie, it is still a great, contained epic. douglas is excellent in the lead and the direction is very good. the story is exciting and well done for what it is (epics tend to either definitely succeed or definitely fail). it comes recommended, but I could see how it would be left out of the kubrick box as kubrick had a lot of other, better things to offer. worth watching once, i'd recommend it as one to buy"
5,A perfect film w/ an outstanding cast! Bravo!,"If this is not the quintesstential epic, then it has yet to be made. This is a story of many loves, & Kirk Douglas managed to bring it all to the screen. Kubrick disavowed this film, & rightfully so, as he came on board after the film had already started.This is a tale of a fight for freedom, & one that, although Spartacus is defeated, he lives on through his family. As he states to Crasssus, Antoninus & the others will be back, & they'll be millions.The casting for this film was perfect, & each & every one of them shine. From Douglas to Olivier to Ustinov, who deserved his Oscar as the slimy slave trader.I long for films such as these."
4,Spartacus is an interest4ing movie.,"An old movie, but very entertaining. Can remember when it first came out years ago. It was interesting then and interesting now."
2,Did not receive what I ordered,"The DVD came in a different package, No HD, no digital sound very diappointed. I returned production and I'm not sure if my account was credited. After returning the item, I saw the Blue-Ray edition for less on the amazom site. So once I get my credit for the Black cover edition of ""SPARTACUS"", not the one pictured above, I would like to order the Blue-Ray version in HD & Digital surround sound. Thanks, Marianne Bocchichio"
2,Grainy HD DVD image - buy the standard DVD,"The sharpness of the HD DVD picture serves, in this case, just to increase the grainy look of the bad copy they've used. My old Spartacus DVD has the same irritating look, and it's a shame we have to pay more for a HD DVD expecting better picture and they don't care."
3,Could have shorter.,"I believe this picture to be above average in acting but there were scenes that dragged on into eternity at times, the flight from the Romans, the day to day struggles. At times I wanted to say ""okay, I get the idea, it's rough being pursued by Romans and making a living at the same time"". This is one Biblical epic that could have been trimmed time-wise by forty-five minutes and the quality would have been improved. All in all still a good flick."
4,This My Friends is an EPIC,"And films like 'Gladiator' will copy it again and again...But Sparticus is probably the best of the genre (a genre I don't particularly care for - though it lets thousands of extras have there moment of glory)But see this one for Olivier, Ustinov, and Laughton who are amusing to say the least."
3,2.5 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Spartacus is of course beloved due to its director, but it's an overlong and sprawling movie whose attempts at romance fall pretty flat and whose ending leaves something to be desired; if you've got three hours it might be worth seeing for pure spectacle, but expect a large serving of corn with the meaty battle scenes."
3,Spartacus,"I am a fan of these kind of movies but I have to admit I have seen better. It was a great story but i thought it was too gory. It was really violent and there was a lot of drama. The violence was cool to me but i didn't like the drama! Three stars I think is how much it deserves because it wasn't the best or worse movie I have ever seen. If you have never seen it and are looking to see if you should, I think you should watch it. It is a little too long but some people like those kind of movies. And another cool part about the movie is that it is based on a true story."
1,sparticus,"hiwas sent a sparticus dvd that did not play on my system,i sent it back 4-30-2010 and have not heard from the seller.f a chavez"
2,Next time restore w/o adding more.,"It is a great movie as the other reviews state. I was *VERY* disappointed however the people involved felt inclined to *ADD* footage that was cut from the original release. This was a very weighty 6 minutes (homosexual seduction attempt) that detracted from the movie and is why the original talents chose to leave it out. It is amazing they still call it a restoration when you add scenes to the movie, rather than including them in the ""Bonus Materials"" section. BAD MOVE! What next? Find the original on tape at the library and put up with the poor quality ORIGINAL movie. My 8 year old thought the scene [was bad] too."
1,Spartacus,"i didn't know this can only be played on a HD DVD Player, have not been able to watch this"
5,One Of The Best Films Ever Made,"Buy this movie now on the special Criterion edition. this film is one of the first movies to openly defy the blacklist-supurb acting, directing, and story."
4,Kubrick's Film Making Genius,"This movie is worth viewing just for the long shot near the conclusion, showing a seemingly endless row of crucified slaves stretching for miles along the road. An incredible, unforgettable, startling image. Although Kubrick detested the way this movie was edited (and there ARE some cornball 50s cliches in it) shots like the aforementioned prove that there's still a lot of Kubrick's film making genius on display in Spartacus."
5,dvd is great. miracle of modern technology.,"In 1960 I was 14 years old and the film ""Spartacus"" had an incredible impact on me. This dvd version still holds the same magic and impact."
2,Not so good Blu-ray transfer,"Be sure you rent this on Blu-ray before you buy it. All the reviews about the transfer (Blu-ray)agree that it is not good. Getting a 2.5 rateing and a ""shame on Universal"" tells me - even if you love the movie - don't buy before you check it out first. Too bad they didn't do the work necessary for a great HD release. It has been restored beautifully, but, unfortunately, not a great transfer to Blu-ray."
5,Kubrick's disappointment is still our triumph,"Although he was never happy with Spartacus, due to creative differences with Kirk Douglas, any other director would be very proud of it.But as we all know, Kubrick's level of perfection was so high that if his own vision was to be watered down - then he would never be happy about it.On the whole, Spartacus is an excellent film. The transfer, on the special two disc edition, is very good but what marks this edition out as the best is the plethora of extra features, which have sadly been cut down on the blu ray edition.Why that was done is anyone's guess as Dalton Trumbo's notes (read as an audio commentary) are fascinating and at times savage in their criticism of Kubrick and others.A great film presented in an excellent edition."
2,I couldn't finish watching it.,"I couldn't finish watching 'Spartacus'. It was long, long, long, and boring, boring boring. Don't listen to those Kubrick fans who pretend to like it and say it is great."
1,Romans wore '50's style hairdoos?,"Historically inaccurate in many places. Kirk Douglass wears a ducktail. Tony Curtis's casting and performance are ridiculous. I'd watch ""Gladiator"" 10 times before I'd sit through another showing of this movie."
1,Hokey even for it's time,"Bought this movie after reading all the reviews and gotta say I sure don't agree. Even for it's time, the acting is lame, the set is mostly obvious backdrops, and the action scenes are so fake it's almost laughable. It was like watching a high school presentation without the benefit of seeing your kid. Don't waste your money, I'll give you my copy."
2,Overrated.,"This movie is overrated. The special effects look horrible when compared to todays movies and the excessive filler makes you want to cry ""attack of the filler"".Not reccomended, although it isn't horrible."
4,A classic--and the Peter Ustinov extras are priceless!,"I grew up with this movie and it will always have a place in my heart. I have found,though, that as I have gotten older, the characters of the freedom-seeking slaves sem less interesting than those of the Romans. The slaves are too ""good"" to ring true, while the Romans seem more rounded out characters. Would that Kubrick could have directed the film with his own vision!And I thoroughly loved the Peter Ustinov interviews. The '92 interview was so funny (expecially Peter's ""impressions""), yet informative and the '60 interview was off the wall as well. Thoroughly enjoyable!!"
1,"Awesome movie, lame HD DVD","The movie is awesome - 5 stars.HD DVD transfer looks grainy (digital noise) and the colors are off and washed out. As crazy as it sounds, it looks worse then I remember it on VHS.Anyway, the standard DVD is better than this on an upconvert DVD player.Really dissapointing...."
1,Spartacus 50th Ann. Blu Ray,"Abysmal image quality. Noise reduction has turned the picture into a smooth mush with no detail. Additionally, the image isn't centered, so there's a black bar on the right-hand side. The old Criterion DVD looked better than this.It's a pity, given how good the movie is, and how good it should look on blu ray. Shame on you, Universal.Not worth your money. I'm returning mine for a refund."
4,Spartacus Blu-ray,Excellent video transfer; audio is about as good as it gets. Unlike some Blu-ray discs which have the audio recorded at very low levels and little dynamic range. This one is a definite keeper.
2,for the Blu-ray release.,"This is the worst transfer to blu-ray of a major film that I have ever seen. Film grain is missing, but so is sharpness of image. Contrast is poor with blacks especially lacking. Night scenes are not nearly as visible as they should be. Skin tones are too red and there is haloing in some scenes. A disgrace. I don't know anything about who owns the rights to this film, but a hi def version of the Criterion release would have been infinitely better than this. I would definitely wait for a reissue before purchasing."
3,BLU RAY - NO WAY !!,"Hugely disappointing Blu Ray ! Not even one critic has mentioned that crucial blacks are far from black ! In particular the dark scenes in the gladiators sleeping quarters - what is meant to be dark ( unlit ) areas turn out to be cloudy washed out and almost opaque shades of grey. Most of the outdoor scenes are muted in focus and nowhere near as good as the criterion ordinary dvd. A very lazy production , by lazy and certainly morally irreverent transfer technicians who , it appears , clearly failed in their attempt to produce a quality blu ray product !Whether their excuse is down to a scrooge like budget or not - a transfer to blu ray of a classic movie of this stature ( even 50 yrs old ) should never be attempted without the proper restorative tools , full care and much more purposeful attention !Shame...."
2,Non-anamorphic widescreen,"If you have a widescreen TV, get the criterion version. This version sports new packaging, but it's the same print from 10 years ago...which is to say it is NOT enhanced for correct display on widescreen TVs."
3,"Great movie, bad HD DVD transfer.","First of all, the movie is great, exciting acting and action, great story. The HD DVD transfer is less than perfect. The images lack vibrant color, most scenes are dull and have muted color. The sountrack transfer is also less than perfect. The dialogue is somewhat muddy and overshadowed with background sounds. Despite the bad HD DVD transfer, I highly recommend this movie from the golden age of Hollywood."
4,"Great Movie, Weak on Extras","Great movie, enough said about that. Picture quality is very good but somehow does not look significantly better than DVD. I am very picky about picture quality and was hoping for a little more. This disc should at least have carried over all the extras from the criterion collection edition but it does not."
4,Spartacus - The classic spectacle film now on Blu ray.,"In the current age of CGI rendered spectacles, Spartacus will still be remembered as a literate epic and possibly the last to use thousands of ""living"" human extras. What they cannot offer are the timeless performances of characters you care about - Kirk Douglas, Jean Simmons, Tony Curtis, Peter Ustinov, Charles Laughton, the incomparable Laurence Olivier, and others. Top that off with direction by Stanley Kubrick, and you have a classic by any standards. The Blu ray transfer is excellent, surpassing previous DVD issues. Based on when it was produced, the film cannot take advantage of the newer high definition audio formats, but the Dolby Digital is very good. If this is a film genre you enjoy, it is a must for your film collection."
5,"Puts ""Gladiator"" to shame","A classic gladiator film that still holds up decades later. This has so many things going for it. It's presented in its original Super Technirama 70 widescreen format - watching this any other way is unthinkable, similar to Lawrence of Arabia. This edition has a plethora of extras, and it's anamorphic, unlike the Universal dvd. Perhaps most endearing is the performance by Jean Simmons. She is so beautiful and luminous here - I can see why Spartacus was in love with her! A great, great film with many superb performances. This is the one to get."
5,SPARTACUS,"This DVD of SPARTACUS arrived in good order, along with several other historical DVDs from Amazon. I needed this DVD, so that I could show clips of the gladiator uprising and the big battle scene to my history class at the Community College. Besides, the VHS player chewed up several of my VHS tapes, so I needed this DVD quickly and Amazon was right there. Fantastic job in shipping and handling. Great epic from a bygone era. At least, it was from a time when they used real live extras and not something computer generated. Thanks. B.L."
1,Not happy as the DVD could not be played,I tried to play the DVD (i.e. Spartacus) that I purchased from your seller on my computer and on my Sony DVD player; but the DVD could not be played because it is defective. The players fail recognize the DVD even after trying several times.I do not know what to do now. Please advise.
1,Would have given more stars if I could have seen it,"I have the regular criterion collection of this moviebut I wanted to see it in BluRay. Of course see is the operative word here. Two discs sent by Amazon, both would not load. Bought it from B--- B--, wouldn't load either, and of course the replacement wouldn't load.Bought the BluRay version of The Wolfman this week, another Universal product, and of course flawed and the replacement flawed.So let the buyer beware, obviously Universal has no quality control, and doesn't care if you purchase its products or not"
2,long winded,this book doesnt get to the point he talks on and on about nothing when he gives the information you are so tired you have lost excitement do not buy unless you like when someone is just trying to make there book long for no real reason
1,Absurd,"AbsurdIn addition to being absurd and insulting, this program hasn't even been substantiated. If it worked, the experienced professionals in the fitness industry would have recommended it. They haven't.The title of the book says it all: 7 minute? Miracle?Here's a title: marketing.Once again perpetuating the ""spot reduction"" myth--in seven minutes no less--to the uninformed. This book was so terrble I put it down after finishing 2/3rds of it."
2,The 7-Minute Miracle: The Breakthrough Program to Banish Spot Fat Forever,"This might be a great program for younger people. It was just to strenuous for me, therefore undo-able."
5,GREAT STORY,"THIS IS ABOUT A COUPLE WHO HAS TAKEN CARE A GIRL SINCE SHE WAS ONE. NOW, SIX YEARS LATER HER NATURAL FATHER WANTS HER BACK. THIS IS THE STORY OF THEIR FIGHT TO KEEP HER"
5,Heartbreaking story!,"It's à very moving , heartbreaking story since it's a true story!I recommend everyone to watch it but have a huge box of Kleenex at hand!"
4,The songs grow on me,"This is the first CD I've bought by Debbie Friedman after hearing much about her music but never actually hearing her sing. Each successive time I listen to it, the energy of the music, her voice, and the beautiful words of the songs just keep growing on me. I love the fact that the words are printed inside the cover - I'm beginning to sing-along. It's an album of songs that just makes me feel good. I'm buying additional copies to give my grown daughters for their birthday. I think it will grow on them too and become a favorite ""classic"" of ours over the years."
1,An egregiously over-produced piece of pap.,"Ms. Friedman has a lovely voice and some of the songs aren't bad, but the producer ought to be flogged. Every cliche in the book is here: strings, cheesy synthesizers, angel choir, saxophone solos. It's a real shame.I'm sorry I spent my money on it."
2,It's You,"I wanted ""non Jesus"" spiritual music. Well, I got that but not much more. The arrangments are more suited for the elevator than the living room. The lyrics are predictable, and Friedman's voice sounded a bit flat to me. On two tracks it sounds like she is trying to hit notes out of her range. One positive note...There was one fabulous track 'Sarahs Song' which is wonderful. It was refreshing, and at least I liked one track.. Sadly, I cannot recommend this."
4,Copper Rain Chain Bell/Cup combo Link/Loop,"Haven't installed it yet--plan to do so this week. It's attractive, appears to be well made, and should serve the purpose; that said, however, I did not receive the rain chain I ordered, which was supposed to be the link/loop combo. What I got was the similar chain made entirely of bell cups with no links between, which is less appealing visually. Rather than deal with the nuisance of sending it back, I decided to go ahead and keep it, but it was disappointing."
5,Rise of Nations Thrones & Patriots,"The one thing I dislike is one must play with the disc, whereas with Rise of Legends you do not."
3,Not a Necessary Expansion,"If you have 30 dollars to kill, then youll still enjoy it. I'm not saying that the expansion is a bad game, I just think that for all the things you get in the amazing basic Rise of Nations, the expansion pack isnt really necessary. It comes with 4 or 5 new nations, 2 of which are native americans, but with only a few new buildings, I think that youll be happy with just the original. Its still a great game nonetheless."
3,A great expansion for under $10!,"About all the expansion gives you, though, is more balanced gameplay. Not much new in graphics, playability, etc. Same stuff, different disc."
2,"Lots of bugs!, No one online to play!!","I do love this game, it could have been great! There are a lot of bugs, and for a #1 best selling game you would think there are a ton of people online to play, but no at 9pm on a Friday night there are about 50 players online and half of them are just talking smack to each other. It is a shame that there is not more company support for this game. IT is a lot of fun to play once you get past the bugs and wait sometimes 25 min to get a game going. This is not like Battle net at all! IT just seams the game is lost."
5,A Good Read,I gave this book to my wife as a gift. She never put it down. She loved the short stories. She would read a story or two before going to bed. I would recommend this book.
5,Bill Wallace of China,"Bill Wallace was the first cousin of my Grandfather, Raymond Wallace, so this book was a great resource for my children and grandchildren and the understanding they will have of how dangerous our missionaries have it in foreign lands. The love of God and people has to motivate one to sacrifice family and life to answer the calling of our Lord to service. I love and appreciate all the men and women who do this daily without thinking of self. I wish and pray that we all appreciate our religious freedom in America and don't take it for granted."
2,Missing Diagrams,"I appreciate that this book was scanned and uploaded. However, if I hadn't got this for free, I'd be pretty upset. Many diagrams are missing. In some instances, they are replaced with text gibberish. It looks like the person who scanned this trusted their text recognition software to turn this into an ebook and didn't bother to proofread."
3,Brazilian film,"""An abandoned gold mine in the heart of Central Brazil, two outcasts live in extreme circumstances. A nosedive into the souls of two Brazilians lost in one of the country's forgotten corners.""This is typical of many Brazilian films .... a depressing glimpse into the negative aspects of life in Brazil including poverty and violence. The main reason I bought the DVD was to help me learn about Brazil and the Portuguese language. There are only two actors in this film, and the plot is simple. Can these two strangers build a successful life together living in such desolate circumstances? To find out buy the DVD."
3,Faraday is a TIME TRAVEL Pioneer,"Where the heck is his book on time travel? Also, why does he wear a tie while stranded on an island? This man is fascinating!PS - The artist who painted his picture on the cover should be fired. Faraday looks nothing like that."
2,BEWARE OF DEFECTIVE BINDING ON THIS PRODUCT. CONTENT IS GOOD THOUGH.,"The binding on the spine of this book is faulty. I purchased this book earlier in the year and returned it; the cover along the spine had detached from the underlying binding. Whenever you open the book, it made crinkly noises and didn't feel right. I subsequently re-purchased this book months later and the second book had the same problem. I spoke to multiple residents in my program and they all had the same problem with this book. This is not an isolated event, but a problem with the manufacture of this particular book. I plan to glue the spine back together myself or take it to a bookbinding company. This defect is serious -- it detracts from the lifespan and value of this expensive book! Who wants to spend $160 for a book to have it fall apart and require glue or duct tape? Ridiculous! This is very unfortunate too, because the content of the book is very good. To the manufacturer and Amazon -- do something here!!"
4,Great for first year residents and beyond,"I purchased this book at the tail end of my first year and wish I had gotten it sooner. It is an awesome quick reference for conferences and sign-out. The descriptions of what to look for in a particular lesion are great. The differential diagnoses are a touch incomplete. However, for the differentials listed, an explanation of why the lesions are different is given. Another bonus is the fact that special stains are included for each lesion (my personal favorite). The book could be a bit more organized, but I think this will come with age. Overall I thinks it's a great book and a good buy (bordering on must buy) for the lost confused eyes of a first year resident."
3,Needs improvement,"A direct quote (p. 866): Clinically, melanomas occuring on the sun-damaged skin of the face and presenting as large irregularly pigmented patches have been referred to as lentigo maligna melanoma.Does the author know what she is writing about?Other sections are better. E.g. I quite liked the GI tract. Nevertheless, this book, in its present shape, is a pseudo-help for residents. With so many excellent textbooks available, what is the use of a less than average one?"
5,The Magic of Lassie,"The is such a fantastic movie, that I've always remembered it even though I haven't seen it in about 20 years. I am now getting this movie for my two daughters."
5,Cute movie,"Typical Lassie movie, but enjoyed it very much. The quality of the video was excellent as well. Was sad when Lassie was taken away from the family but in true Lassie spirit, he made his way back home and all ended well."
4,The Magic Of Lassie-VHS,Love the movie was looking for it for years just wish it could have been in DVD. Was in good condition thank you.
4,Good family movie,"I watched it while babysitting with 5 and 7 year old, they loved the movie. I won't tell u the story because everybody knows it. Just this version of Lassie is worth watching. I want to ask the guy form UK where did u buy it on DVD?"
5,Such a life time album,A Great Space Progressive RockIn this album you'll find enough space to float in your dreamsThe thought music with a strange power to be effectiveyou can enjoy the fine space rock music that is mixed with a real good rock lyricAnd he knows that the truth will be deniedso Never waist your time on poor things
3,Not the same as the formula sold on Dr. Weil's website,"I'm a huge fan of Dr. Weil and his supplement recommendations. At different times, I've subscribed to the Dr. Weil Vitamin Advisor program, but I found that I could get the supplements through Amazon for less money (and free shipping), so I decided to go that route. However, when I received this item, I realized that it wasn't the same as the formula sold through Dr. Weil's website. The formula you buy from Dr. Weil directly is just one antioxidant capsule per day, not two. In addition, this standalone bottle is missing Lycopene (10 mg), Phytoene (800 mcg), and Phytofluene (800 mcg). And the standalone bottle includes Vitamin C (200 mg), whereas the version you get from Dr. Weil's website does not have any Vitamin C. If you don't find this a problem, then I do recommend this product."
4,excellent product but pricey,"I like this formula, but it's so expensive I switched to another ""ACES"" product. which unfortunately didn't have mixed tocopherols, had too much vitamin C, as well as an unpleasant odor. all the other cheaper formulas I researched had the acidic type of vitamin C. so I'm back with Dr. Weil."
2,Seemed nice at first,"When I first got this phone set it seemed nice, but that quickly changed. The talk button on the handsets is so sensitive that holding it too tightly to your face will hang up the call. My wife and I have each done this at least a dozen times now. Also the phones redial mode is awkward, it is suppose to know long distance based on Caller ID but it fails to dial correctly half of the time. The phone sometimes will also ""lock up"". The hand set becomes unresponsive and needs to be placed on the base for a few seconds to reset itself. I am already planning on buying another phone from another company."
1,No Good!,These phones are ridiculously hard to hear. I have a daycare in my home and I need a phone I can hear over the dull roar of my house!! This one isn't it!
1,Stay away from this one!,"We must have the worst bad luck when it comes to phones and this purchase did nothing to help that situation. There is only one ring tone, and it has an exceptionally irritating high pitched tone. Worse, there is no way to turn the ringer volume down, it's on or off and on is very loud. There is also a problem with the way the dialing works. Sometimes, it seems the numbers to not go through. You can see that you have dialed the proper numbers on the LCD screen, but the call does not go through. Particularly annoying when entering numbers for a PIN for voicemail for example, or following prompts from automated call services.Extremely disappointed."
2,GE 5.8 cordless phone,I have found no customer support for these phones - When we moved and plugged them in - they will ring but you can't answer them - cannot call out on them either. The ringer is irritating and there are only 3 choices.
2,"nice pictures, not so great research","Although I do credit this book with whetting my appetite to research further into Lilith and I did enjoy reading it when I first started it, after I did more research myself, I realized how flawed Koltuv's research is. She makes assertions while giving no evidence (such as stating that Lilith appears in Germanic mythology, which she doesn't), and she throws a lot of non-Lilith myths, stories, etc., that are similar to Lilith but treats them as if they are actually directly connected instead of just being ""archetypally"" connected. She also makes the usual claim that Lilith was originally a goddess, and, per usual, gives no evidence for this assertion. This is an OK intro to Lilith book and is a fun read, but do your serious research into Lilith elsewhere."
3,Kinda Sorta Maybe,"This is a pretty good book - I agree with the previous reviewer who said the author makes too many assertations that have no apparent root in fact - this is true. The writing itself can get confusing and doubles back on itself, but that is to be expected. I think it centers a little too much on psychology rather than the myth itself. Still, I did enjoy reading it (and LOVED the illustrations) and I am interested in reading more about Lilith."
3,A pretty picture book,"""Nara Encounters"" is a collection of pretty photographs, combined with short quotes or poems from various writers and wits. The focus of the book is on Nara City, rather than Nara Prefecture.The photographs are nice, although nothing particularly unique. Close-up shots of flowers, long shots of sweeping terrain, the burning fields, the lanterns, the deer, and of course, the enormous Great Buddha. This is not a photo-journalist's guide to Nara, but instead a photo-romanticist's guide.The writing ranges from pithy and interesting, to as frothy and decorative as the photos. Nara City is an important piece of Japanese history, and this is represented through eyewitness accounts from across the centuries, and delicate Haikus. Rudyard Kipling is one of the featured writers.All in all, ""Nara Encounters"" is a nice book, short on depth and thin in length. It takes the view that Nara is a fairy-tale land of Castles, deer and flowers, with no actual people living in the City."
3,Passable science fiction thriller,"Half-decent science fiction thriller is worth checking out mainly for its eerie atmosphere and good production design. The story, centering around a group of astronauts investigating weird happenings on a remote planet, is basically okay, but a bit dry and choppy at times. Not many extras, but the print is bright and colorful, and looks great on DVD. However, you might want to rent this one first. And is it me, or does the excellent artwork on the DVD box (a strong suit of the MGM ""Midnite Movies"" series) look like it was drawn by the great Steve Ditko, in his 1960s heyday?"
2,to old to corny,this flick so bad i couldn't keep awake on bad effects and bad space scenes and the strings on the models
3,Surprisingly smart.,"I rented this DVD only out of curiosity because I had heard of this often overlooked sci-fi entry made by Mario Bava. To be honest, given its' B-movie status, I was expecting a rather one dimensional gore-fest.Nothing could be further from the truth. Even at this early point in his career, one can see how talented a director Bava is.Clearly shot on a low budget, like Roger Corman, Brava, by using some very clever camera approaches and wonderfully creative sets (its' quite obvious the makers of the Alien films used this along with other 1950s' B-movies as sources)constructs a film that is both intelligent and engaging.An interplanetary crew from Earth, answering a distress signal from another planet, land and get more than they bargained for. Very smart, underplayed and scary.At times I felt I was watching an episode of a well done Star Trek entry.Very well done. Worth the rental."
2,For Mario Bava completists only!,"An amateurish low-budget movie, complete with shoddy special effects, weak sets, stilted acting, and an unbelievably corny script. Perhaps if this film had been made in the '50s, its many shortcomings could be more easily forgiven. As it is, there is not much to recommend here unless you are a fan of Mario Bava and just want to see all his films. As for Bava as a filmmaker, I'm struggling to find the appeal. ""Black Sunday"" and ""Black Sabbath"" are certainly worthy films, but the rest of his films I've watched (""Planet of the Vampires,"" ""Hatchet for the Honeymoon,"" and ""Bay of Blood"") are miserable, lousy movies that are downright painful to watch."
2,Too Slow,"The coolest thing about this is the ending, but it takes 88 minutes to get there and you will see NO vampires along the way. The planet is kinda cool, but the movie could have been so much better. this isn't one of the better movies in the midnight movies series."
1,Laughably Bad,"Sometimes truly bad movies can be good for a laugh, which is the best I can say about this one. The budget must have been all of $1.69, with no more than one take per scene. Rent it before you buy it."
3,Am I Wrong to Expect a Blood-Sucker or Two?,"I have to begin this little narrative by saying that I'm a Bava fan; most particularly ""Black Sunday"" but I wasn't expecting a horror film of that level when I bought this flick but ... with nary a vampire in sight, I felt *totally* ripped off recently when I watched this movie.Rather, it was barely filled with spacemen that died during a fight and came back to life; zombies if you will, but not the flesh-eating kind.And *sigh* ... not a single vampire ...The lighting in the film, however, was spectacular, and if you are a SciFi fan and not expecting a vampire of any kind, you'll LOVE this film!"
3,"Strange,but interesting","This film was made by Italian director Mario Bava who made a number of good horror films in the sities and early 1970's. This film was made on a slim budget, but they did the bet they could. They utilized left over sets from a sword and sandal epic, then they pumped in the fog and covered the landscape with lots of vibrant blues and reds to really give it an alien feel. The story starts with a spaceship responding to a distress call from another ship in their fleet. They discover the crew has murdered each other, but then the bodies disappear. The crew is performing repairs and then some of their members disappear one by one. They are forced to kill each other and then invisible alien invaders take over their bodies. The plot is fair, but the odd camera angles and the look of the planet help to make this one worth seeing. This film is sometimes very strange, but sometimes near brilliant considering what little they had to work with."
2,Dull and atrociously dubbed Italian SF/horror,"Directed by Mario Bava and based on the short story ""One Night Of 21 Hours"" by Renato Pestriniero. Along with IT! THE TERROR FROM BEYOND SPACE, this also inspired ALIEN. It centers around a space expedition to a barren planet, Aura. But once the crew lands, members suddenly become given to random acts of violence against each other, caused by the ""vampiric"" mind control the planet has over them.PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES (aka DEMON PLANET) is generally rather daft and wooden and is only saved by Bava's visual flair. Watching this, it feels as though you're watching a long lost episode of DR. WHO. This is the first Bava movie I've seen, I wasn't totally impressed after all the raves I read of BLACK SUNDAY and TWITCH OF THE DEATH NERVE. Maybe the next film of his I see will live up to my earlier expectations. Personally I just found this to be dull and plodding. And the music score is almost guaranteed to give viewers a migrane."
2,Very cheesy,I found this movie laughingly bad. I only give it props for the sets which were good and even a little scary however I found everything else to be terrible. The acting was awful and dialogue was equally bad. I hated the way it would never seem to end and how wooden everyone seemed to act. Bava really is an over rated director. I wasn't impressed with some of his other work either.
3,A simple tool for designing structures,"It is a one of the very handy tool for day to day structural engineering calculations. Even though it doesn't cover like Roark's ""Formula for Stress and Strain"", it deals the necessary structural engineering formulas with nice graphs and simply tables. Just pick the values from tables and graphs, and use it in the calculation. It also covers various loading configurations for rigid multistory frames, which are very much helpful while doing the preliminary design without the help of sophisticated computer programs. I also feel that the tables given for rectangular and circular plates are one of the simplest representations of complex formulas."
5,works,"Bought this for my Granddaughter and it really does work. The baby good sports videos are entertaining, educational and fun. This one helps calm them down and by the end of the video they are almost always sleeping."
1,i did not use it,it was not the right one for my corolla 96 1.8 how can i get my money back tank you
1,RIP OFF !!,"""I am VERY disappointed that the expansion pack was MORE EXPENSIVE than the whole system and had LESS containers!!!! The description of the expansion pack did not say the exact number of containers/lids, so I assumed it equaled the system. IT WAS HALF THE NUMBER OF CONTAINERS AND LIDS. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!! READ THE FINE PRINT!!!! Wish I had read the other one star rating!"""
1,A steal,"If your in then market for replacement items, I advise you to buy the full pack and not the expansion pack. You only recive 12 items for your US$15.00 compared to 24 items in the orginal pack (for the same amount of money). Also if you wish to return it they ONLY accept phone calls to return items, email is not allowed!"
1,Smart spin storageExpansion pack,"Not what I was expecting. Wanted more containers in this deal . After I talked to customer service noted only 12 containers came with this pack. Four of each size 8, 16 & 24 oz containers. I rec'd all the same size containers. I also purchased a smart spin storage system @ $16.50 & expansion pack @ $19.99 together. They sent both separate with System S&H $16.50 & Exp Pack S&H $22.99. Total $36.50 for items & $40.00 S&H plus taxes. It was a disaster. Not worth to continue . Pretty expensive plastic. Must pay attention I guess. I like to get kissed when I get screwed!! THXS"
4,Something to listen to when you're mad.,"Once in awhile, when your pissed off, you need something to listen to thats fast, hard and releases your stress and anger. This album is like an overdose of arrid. All the yelling and screaming and distorted guitars in this album make you feel better after being very tense. phew. man, im stressed out, i need to pop in some good riddance."
2,nothing new here,"if you don't have it, i would have to reccomend getting ""ballads from the revolution"". aside from this album not ebing anything too great, russ rankin's vocals consist compeltely of him using the biggest words he can find in the thesaurus and trying to act like everything he says is extremely profound. i dont listen to music to hear about someone's philosophy, but if you do, you may like this."
4,Secrets are not always good things,I have had this movie taped for years - I've watched it over and over and when I finally got the opportunity to get it on DVD I jumped at it. This story is magical. Not in the mythical way. It makes you feel like there is hope that you will find the one person you can't live without and when you do find them you hold onto them no matter what.
2,Weak,The story is weak. The guy comes on strong in a way that would be very unattractive and drive the girl away from him. So it is very unrealistic that the girl would fall in love him with. I found it to be pretty boring.
5,Sweet movie,I watched this movie on Netflix and wanted to add it to my permanent DVD collection. The acting is good and it was a fun way to spend a couple of hours. The leading actor has a great Irish accent. What's not to like there!
4,First KJ recording,"These guys are really in tune with each other. The trio (Oliver Wood - guitar, Chris Long - bass, Greg Baba - drums) is where it all started. For the roots of King Johnson, check out CATS & DOGS."
4,"Alux is a geat group, but this wasn't their best CD","I am from Guatemala, and all my life I heard Alux, I think this is the greatest group of Central America, if you are interested in Alux I recommend you to try to find ""Leyenda I"" and ""Leyenda II"" CDs, so you can know what Alux really is. I though this CD is good but not as the other mentioned. I hope people from other countries hear Alux, so they will kwow that here in Guatemala, exists good music."
2,Alux Nahual really bites!,"Alux Nahual is perhaps one of the most overrated Rock en Español bands out there. Unless you're into Huey Lewis and the News or slow, melodramatic ballads, do not get this album. Aside from the fact that most of the songs are in Spanish, the album almost completely lacks a Latin flavor-just about all the songs are cheap rip-offs of American Top 40. I don't know if it has something to do with the fact that the lead singers are all basses (most good Rock en Español bands have tenors), but this album sucks!!"
3,"Bueno, se siente el final de una era","Para quienes conocen la musica de Los Aluxes podran notar que este es un disco que resume los ultimos anos del grupo. Mi nombre es Giacomo Buonafina y me dedico a producir musica Centroamericana. Habiendo tenido la oportunidad de trabajar con ellos en la re-grabacion de algunos de sus grandes extitos pienso que este era el comienzo de el final. Alux Nahual ya no existe y es una gran perdida para la musica Centroamericana. Para quienes les interese, acabo de producir un Tributo a la banda conjuntamente con 22 grupos de Centro America y uno de Mexico se llama EL ESPIRITU DEL DUNDE. Son dos volumenes, el primero ya esta en la calle y el segundo saldra a finales del mes de mayo 1999. El sello es DIDECA/Primera Generacion. Se los recomiendo, es una ventana a la vieja musica de los Aluxes y tambien para la nueva generacion de musicos del area."
3,"Love The Music, hate the case (not authentic)","As always Freddie Mercury's vocal talent is amazing! However, the CD that I received was not an authentic copy. It didn't have the original CD jacket that includes all the song lyrics, so I was pretty disappointed with that. I will keep this CD just to have in my car. But I am going to purchase authentic copies of both Mr. Bad Guy & Barcelona for my Freddie (Melina) Mercury collection! It distresses me that there are so many people out there trying to make a buck off of such incredible talent as Mr. Mercury!!! But I suppose as long as the world runs on money, there will always be crooks!"
4,"Easy to use, works great!","This external battery is quite good, actually. It's super easy to use...just charge it up and when your PSP is about to die plug it into the PSP! It literally DOUBLES your gaming time! It's also not too big so it can fit in my PSP Core Gamer Leather Case. Great for those who travel a lot and want to bring their PSP with them."
1,That picture does not match the product,"Or it shouldn't... I have the product pictured above, and it retails at less than $300. The product called Saeco Magic Comfor Plus does cost the price listed... Company should clarify if they are selling Saeco Magic or Saeco Magic comfort plus. Big price difference."
5,Open My Eyes Lord,This is an excellent book. I will read it again and again and share it with others.
5,Favorite!!,"My all time favorite creamer,I don't understand why they would discontinue it? Makes me look forward to my morning coffee. Please bring back!"
4,Great Sax!,"This sax is beautiful and sounds great. Everything came in tip-top shape and the only reason it didn't get 5 stars was that the ad says it comes with ""Reeds"" as in plural. It came with one, which whether by my fault or not broke in the first week. I ordered more and it wasn't really a big deal but it is false advertising."
4,Slim volume of excerpts . . .,"Published in limited editions in 1981 by Northland Press in Flagstaff, Arizona, this handsome but very slim volume (70 pp., hardback) is comprised of excerpts from two Ross Santee novels, ""Men and Horses"" (1926) and ""Cowboy"" (1928), chiefly the latter, with 19 of Santee's illustrations. The book includes a brief introduction by David Laird and a one-page bibliography of Santee's works."
5,The Best-Kept Secret in the Classical Music Industry!,"""Zino Vinnikov Plays Fritz Kreisler"" is a splendid recording of some of the Viennese master's absolute gems. The performers are truly first-rate. Zino Vinnikov has the rare capacity to ally delightful technical mastery with depth and subtlety of interpretation. It is, however, above all his exquisite tone and stunning phrasing that makes this CD stand out from all other recordings of Kreisler pieces (and, believe me, I own a few!). Sergey Maltsev provides a brilliantly equilibrated accompaniment on the piano.Vinnikov is indeed, as his label puts it, 'The Best-Kept Secret in the Classical Music Industry'. It is nothing short of amazing (or dare I say scandalous?) that music lovers have been denied this revelation for so long. Highly recommended."
5,I loved the progression,"I think i was missing the thematic development behind Cy, before I bought this book. The quality of his ""notes"" paintings is very good."
3,A lot of regurgitation of facts,"I'm not sure how I feel about this book. It seems factual heavy, which is why I skimmed it. I often felt like he was criticizing the Catholic Church, despite being a Catholic himself. I did like the final chapter and the afterward, which seemed more hopeful for the Church and the actual ""action"" of the novel, as opposed to the regurgitation of facts."
5,"Preaching to the Choir, Amen Brother","I just finished the book; it was excellent. Anyone who's ever had to suffer the pale and sickly catholic (sic) modernist agenda will appreciate this book instantly. Actually, I'm not here to write a review, I'm here to read what the dissenters are saying. Yup, typical. They just don't get it and never will. In love with their disobedience the way an alcoholic loves his drink. At least Luther had the presence of mind to leave the Church as part of his apostasy. The dissenters have had their day, and now they're just angry because their efforts to destroy the Church have all but failed. I'm just glad to see the revival of orthodoxy and adherence to ""the mind of the Church"" in my lifetime. Thank you, Lord."
5,Gets to the heart of the matter,"Mr. Weigel's book focuses on the Church as a divine institution rather than a social construct. Priests are not mere social workers; they are participants in God's plan to sanctify humanity. By examining the origins of popular Catholic dissent in the United States in light of traditional Church teaching, Mr. Weigel offers a challenge to both faithful and lapsed Catholics alike to recommit to a radical fidelity to the Gospel. The gauntlet is thrown down to those who preach a gospel of ""Catholic lite"": the current young generation of Catholics has had their fill of granola and sprouts. It's time to dig into the meat of Catholic teaching: 2000 years of doctrinal, social and moral truth. Hope found here!"
5,A true story I suspected but had no way of knowing,"It does take courage to be Catholic in the modern world. And that's ok especially when the truth is at stake. Weigel has the background and the discerning intellect to present that truth without the varnish of political correctness and the attempt by self-appointed Catholic ""Intellectuals"" to out secularize the secularist.The truth is always refreshing especially when put forth in a charitable but forthright way.We presented it in a Catholic book club reading and it was very well received by all.An important read for all Catholics in this age of persecution and attack on the church-[what age isn't].The ""Courage to be Catholic"" does present a great gift of hope in the reforms we have already seen in the Church in the last few years."
3,A short story with a classic taste.,"If you find that you enjoyed Frankenstein by Mary Shelly and want a shorter story with the same flavor, this is a good choice. I wouldn't spend money for the hard copy, but for a Kindle download, it is a good value for the read."
4,Don't Hold Back --- Buying It!!!!,"I know music, been writing music for years now. Music is my life; I also write music professionally.By far better than the first cd ""All Work, No Play"". I think they did a far better job WITHOUT R. Petaphile, I mean R. Kelly. Great cd, very consistant with good/great songs. Well worth the buy at full price or not. Highly recommended!JUST BUY THE DAMN CD ITS AWESOME!--------------------My Rating System is based on Amazon's:* = Hate It** = I Don't Like It*** = It's Ok**** = I Like It***** = I LOVE IT!--------------------"
2,It was not what I expected,"I purchased this with my bass guitar. It worked for one tuning... maybe. I couldn't visualize what was ""tuned"" and what wasn't because the strobe is different depending how long the string has vibrated. Asked a pro in the music store to give it a try and they couldn't figure it out either. They said there was too many factors to get a good tuning with this product. I am returning it. I purchased a Korg - Chromatic Solo Tuner and am very happy with it."
4,Good book,"Good book but it's paperback and these GD tree-huggers are taking over the world. I used to be an environmentalist, butt now I say up your ass, man needs his gas."
1,A Very Lame CD,I bought this CD with high hopes that it would be something I could enjoy throughout the holiday season. What a let-down. I chuckled at exactly one comment on one track and ended up scratching my head (or shaking it) on the others. Do not waste your time and money. If you refuse to believe the negative reviews...listen to a few of the tracks of this stinker at Napster.com. If that doesnt convince you then you deserve what you get.
1,Ughhhh!!!!,"This CD is horrible. I laugh at the stupidest things but this was a torture to listen to. Save $15 and buy his other CD's. Larry sounds like he is reading for a room full of rednecks that are asleep. I'm not sure if it is the lack of an audience but I tried to chuckle at a few of the tracks and I just couldn't muster a smile. I enjoyed his ""Lord, I Apologize"" CD so much that I still listen to it and laugh. But this one does not 'git-r-done'."
3,Larry gits'er done just in time for christmas!,"If you are a true Larry The Cable Guy fan ignore the other bad reviews and get this cd! Yes Larry's opinions are over the top,but if you can't take it,then get the hell out of here waterhead! Every track is funny in my opinion I don't care who ya are! I do agree it's too bad the cd wasn't recorded live with laughing from the audience,but it does give it kind or a more personal feel having been recorded from Larry's kitchen,gotta go git a dip cup,Git-R-Done! Merry Christmas and not that Happy Holidays garbage!"
5,"C'mon People - This isn't ""A Pat Boone Christmas""!","This is A Larry Christmas CD and anyone who appreciates Larry The Cable Guy will find it humorous. If you were looking for ""A Very Kathie Lee Christmas"", look elsewhere!"
2,Larry needs a new job.,"I just listened to this CD. My mother-in-law gave us the cd. Now I'm upset that I have just wasted 40 minutes of my life that I will never get back. This CD Stinks. Stupid Humor!! Larry, get a real job. I want a refund!"
1,Do not waste your money,"I use to love Larry's work, but this is the worse CD I have ever purchased. It seemed as if there was no thought into making this CD. I think he needed money for Christmas. This is my last CD from him. You are better off getting a case of beer, a can of beans, and renting a Christmas movie, you will have more laughs. Larry you did not Get-R-Done."
1,Larry needs an audience,"What a disappointment. It's almost as if Larry, his management, or record label decided to cash in on his recent success with a quickie Christmas release. There's no audience reaction to Larry's material, giving this recording an oddly subdued tone. That takes away so much from a comedy album.Larry has built a lot of goodwill with his fans during the past couple years, and is selling out live everywhere he goes. But this release will surely disappoint many of his fans. Diehard bubbas will probably laugh at this hokey, recycled material, but those who are not Larry fanatics aren't going to like this one.Here's hoping ""Larry"" can rebound from this mistake. This was just a bad idea."
2,Larry should apologize!,"Being a big fan of the Larry the Cableman, I was very disappointed in his latest CD. There are little to no production values, and it sounds like he recorded and edited this stinker sitting in his bathroom. Some of the bits are funny, but it would have been nice to put some of his Christmas carols to music. Skip this offering and buy ""Lord, I Apologize"" on CD or DVD. Larry did not Git-R-Done on this ""chalupa""!"
2,"You can do better, Larry.","Listened to this at a friend's house recently. Thankfully, I didn't waste my money on it. It sounds like something that was ad-libbed, dashed off in one recording session, with little thought put into making it funny. I chuckled maybe twice during the whole album (saving it from a one star review). Larry deserves a lump of coal (or worse) in his stocking for releasing this."
1,1 Star because they don't allow negatives...,"Absolutly the worst ""comedy"" album ever made. It sounds like a drunk hillbilly recording himself on a fisher price recorder - the audio quality is horrible (you can hear the mic being turned on and off). The material is horrible (only Larry and some guy in the background seem to find it funny). This is the first CD and LAST time I spend my money on anything associated with Larry the Cable Guy - its obvious that he needs to re-think his career goals if he keeps releasing garbage like this. Do yourself a favor and STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD."
3,Not quite what I expected.,"This booklet is not quite what I expected. It is both a little trite, and a little fantastic, albeit while searching for higher truths.... Still, there are some beautiful thoughts and insightful concepts that can be gleaned while reading it. The bottom line from reading it is positive, provided one does so with a critical and discrimitating mind and has read or is planning to read other material on similar subjects."
5,Si Amar Te Duele.....,"Cuando amar duele es porque se está amando demasiado. Y demasiado significa: de más.Si querés dejar de sufrir por ser una o un co-dependiente afectivo (que es la persona que ama demasiado), debes leer este libro. Te ayudará a darte cuenta de que no sos la única persona a la que le pasa ""eso"". Son muchas las personas que pasan por relaciones inadecuadas y transitan la vida sufriendo por los afectos.En el libro hay ejemplos detallados que ayudan a identificar el problema en uno mismo. Darse cuenta es revelador y es el inicio del camino para salir del dolor.Este es un libro que te dará herramientas para auto-sanarte de esta dolorosa ""enfermedad"" de amar demasiado."
3,Ya no seas codependiente,"Libro es excelente, pero se enfoca mucho en la codependencia de substancias (alcohol) - es mas para personas que tienen ese problema o tienen a un ser querido que sufre de esto, si buscas ayuda para codependencia emocional talvez tengas que buscar otro libro"
4,Almost Perfect,"As far as the string tribute albums go, this is one of my favorites. The only reason I give this a 4 and not a 5 is the lack of ""Boiler"" cover. It's my all-time favorite Bizkit song, and would've loved to hear it on this compilation."
1,W......T......F....!,"this has got to be the most retarded idea ever concieved in the entire universe.but I'm sure they figure some doofus is bound to buy it,so more power to vitamin records.as this is the first review for this cd I'm telling you-get the string tributes to tool or slayer instead of this and the other stupid idea,the system of a down string trib!you'll thank yourself in the end(unless you are braindead)."
5,true love,"A friend told me about this book and she suggested i read it, I am so glad i did. I loved this book, it reminded me of the magic of true love, the feeling you get when you initially fall in love. It is a story of how true love can overcome many obstacles, including career, age and distance. This is an excellent story and well written, i recommend it to anyone who wants to relive their feelings when they first fell in love!"
4,A good read,"This book grabbed me from the very start. Do NOT read the introduction, like most introductions it spoils the actual read. Funny, engaging, great"
5,Nabakov's Hamlet,"Help me, Will. Pale Fire is a book I keep rereading. It is Hurricane Lolita blowing up the coast. It is a portrait of a waxwing slain. The waxwing has soared directly into the glass, mistaking it for a mirror. The poem's the thing wherein we'll catch the conscience of the king.Pushkin comes to mind."
3,No real hypertext for kindle,The lines in the poem aren't interlinked with the commentary as one may have expected from the kindle-edition of this masterpiece.
4,don't follow directions,"Am I the only person that really tried to follow the directions such as ""See notes to line 193""? At one point I found myself trying to read while having 3 fingers stuck in the book so I wouldn't loose my place. If you are going to attempt this perhaps you should buy 2 copies like Charles suggests. I enjoyed the book a great deal and laughed out loud often. I gave up trying to follow the ""see note"" directions when I started running into sections I had already read. Did you notice poor Charles kept changing the color of shorts one of the ""lads"" was wearing. A nice book to read in the hammock."
3,"Brilliant, but perhaps not worth the effort","No one reading this book carefully could doubt Nabokov's genius. However, the novel is so dense and frustrating that I nearly gave up before finishing it. There are infinite puzzles to be worked out here, and frankly I felt the puzzles overshadowed the story itself. I loved Pnin, but this one took it too far.I reccomend the poem in itself though-- a beautiful work."
3,Beyond the Pale Fire,"Fire - a timeless subject. Perhaps rivalling the wheel in terms of its importance in human development, fire has been an important companion in our teleological quest towards perfection. This book didn't really directly tackle the subject of fire as poignantly as would suit my tastes. If you're interested in furthering your knowledge of fire I recommend the movie ""Quest for Fire"", the song ""Fire"" by Arthur Brown, and ""Backdraft."""
1,Senseless and Unenjoyable,"I agree with the reveiwer who branded Pale Fire as brillinat but empty. I found no humour in it whatsoever, just an artist trying to make sport of his readers."
2,Physica-a disappointment,"In the book ""Physica"" by Hildegard von Bingen, she omits 50% of the most important information, which is dosages of the herbs. So who could benefit today from reading it? No-one. And the God inspired information is so ridiculous- ""Lettuce should be eaten without condiment, their injurious juice makes a person's brain empty, and they fill his stomach with illness"". I was so disappointed because I thought this so called visionary's information would be so valuable and transend all time. More like a waste of time not to mention money."
2,Translation avoiding Christian themes,"This book is very interesting as other reviewers noted. The biggest issue I have with it is the poor translation of Christian themes (natural to a work written by a nun of the 12th century). Where the word ""demon"" is used in the original text, the translator, Priscilla Throop, renders it as ""airy spirit"". And yes, there is a big difference between an ""airy spirit"" and a demon. Consider which one you would want in your bedroom at night. Yes, there is a difference. This makes me wonder what else Throop is twisting to fit her own worldview instead of simply giving us Hildegard's writings in common English."
4,Please enter a title for your review,"loves it. so into this album. i guess these guys are kinda washed up and no one really cares anymore but i'm a new fan with this album. i heard their singles before and thought they were just another melodic pop-punk band that didn't know how to be melodic but i've finally realised that they're more about vocals and lyrics than music. i understand the fan consensus is that Musical Monkey is this band's best/definitive album, and i listened to it, but i don't think it's as funny as this one. the character voices and pop/punk-culture references and general middle finger in the air attitude is more potent on this record."
3,Not bad,CD isn't that bad. The CD contains 10 tracks and is a pathetic 22 minutes short. Most Guttermouth fans will like this CD. It would have been nice to have another 20 minutes of music considering their last 2 CD's.
1,"useless, but fun to listen to one time","well, although Mark is definitevely one of the best for singing punk songs, and guttermouth are probably the best punk band out there to see live (thanks mostly to Mark again),in my opininion all the songs they put out now just suck. No more good riffs and violence like on bruce lee, hit machine, 123slam, chicken box,thats life..., which is the only thing their music relies on. Mark's ranting is still there, but the music is appalling.They are still one of the best US punk bands for me, along with Nofx and Goodriddance, but really a part from surf's up on the previous album which is a decent song, the two latest albums suck, and i'm not mentioning gusto...Now relative to the other garbage punkmusic out there , this album is no worse, but in comparison to previous stuff they did, i am afraid it sucks. Basically i would say this is a boring version of t.yakimoto or musical monkey"
2,"cute, but falling apart","I love this quit, but it's falling apart. I have had it for 2 years, and since it's all hand stitched, it's not very durable for young kids. I am always mending it."
3,Great for Beginners,"This book does suggest 11 different strategies, but doesn't really explain well how to successfully win on all them. Most strategies are built on the previous ones. It's very good for giving you an overview of what strategies you can play in Craps, but doesn't really tell you how to make it profitable. This book is great for a beginner. If you are familiar with craps already, you might want to pass. Good explanation of Place and Odds betting."
5,ride to live,This cd is great! There are so many songs on this album that are all capable of being hits. My favorite of which is Tombstone. Smith and Harley are a new country rock band who I have no doubt will make it big. You should really purchase this cd so you can see for yourself. I promise you won't be disappointed.
4,This Works and I Can Sleep Better,"I LOVE having the baby right next to me. Very easy to monitor them through the night with a night light near by. I picked the natural color and am enjoying not having baby prints clashing with everything. I do like the cloth siding over the usual plastic, but it's not easy to spot clean.Also butted up against the bed it's not easy for me to get in and out or make my bed look nice made up. The wheels don't roll around very well on my laminate flooring. Probably would do worse on carpet.The side pockets are plentiful and come in handy. I loaded down the large storage area underneath with lots of diapers as we shop in bulk. Made the bed sag a bit, so had to lighten up. Still, it seems like a well-made product with a lot of attention to detail and safety.Perfect for the first few months when MOM needs extra rest and can be used beyond. Highly recommended for a first-time mom or mother who needs to check on baby many times during the night."
4,Great - Happy to Have!,"I think the mini co-sleeper is great! Perfect height, lots of storage space underneath to put extra diapers, blankets, toys, whatever in...the only thing that take's some getting used to are the catches to lower/raise the 'bed' side of the sleeper. They were hard to move up/down when I moved it to the living room and back (which was way easier than a regular pack-n-play, since the mini has wheels on one side!) Overall, I think it's a great product :)"
5,Perfect for us!,When our son got too big for his bassinet we opted to purchase the mini co-sleeper. It has been perfect for us. It lasts longer than a bassinet or the bassinet insert that pack & plays come with. He is nursing so it makes middle of the night feedings wonderful for us because I hear him as soon as he begins to get hungry. A really wonderful buy & well worth the money. We also bought extra sheets which are nice to have.
3,Buy the original co sleeper !,"I have the mini co sleeper and my baby just turned 2 months. I was hoping to keep her in it for 5 months because i live in a small one bedroom apartment, but she has out grown it. She is only 10 lbs but is very active, so she will turn her self sideways in it and it is not wide enough for that, so her head is pressed against the side and legs are all crooked. She already wakes me every 2 1/2 hrs to nurse, and now i wake up more because she gets stuck. Also i couldn't attach it to my bed because my cat thought it was her new bed. I recommend the original size for a little more money. I did think the mattress was too thin and hard as well."
2,Co-sleeper not for nursing mothers,I bought this based on looks recomendations and description. What I got was a glorified pack n play bassinet type thing. The only difference is the side is down on one side to allow you to roll over and pat your baby. I was expecting an extension essentially to my bed with both mine and the baby's matress at the same height this is not so. So I still have to pull her out of her bed abd put her in mine to nurse and then wake her up to put her back in. Plus I have a 4 poster bed with rails down each side at the base of my matress so the sleeper does not push up flush to the bed as it said they should warn about this.
3,ought to be more adjustable,"i could've really used something similar to this after my baby was first born, but they don't sell anything that would've worked with my bed. i sleep on a futon on the floor(i could feel the metal bars through the matress) and my daughter slept with us for the first few months. i really could've used this if the legs could've been removed. she had to move to a crib when she was about 3 months old because she started flipping herself over onto her stomach, and i would've liked to have her next to me a little longer. I guess i could've cut the side off a cardboard box and used that instead *L*"
3,Good but difficult,"This is a good bassinet, especially for travelling but it is very difficult shifting between the side being up and down. Plus it is difficult to lock the thing in place. We have a tall bed and the leg extensions, but the extensions make the bed kind of wobbly. In general, I'm glad that I didn't buy it and that someone else got it for me at my shower. I don't think that I would have liked to pay 140 dollars for this."
4,Love it but mattress is flat and hard.,I love our mini co sleeper. The only thing that we don't like is that the mattress is so flat and hard. Our baby wouldn't sleep in it. I finally bought an egg crate foam mattress pad and cut it to size and then turned it upside down so he could sleep on the flat side. After that he loved it and now sleeps all night long. I wish they made it for heavier babies so that he could sleep in it longer.
1,"waist of money, buy the ORIGINAL, MINI is too small (baby outgrows it in a month)","Ok, when I bought i thought it was the best thing I've ever bought in my whole life, baby loved the mattress, I loved the mattress (firm but comfortable) and he slept like never before (colicky baby)I loved being able to look at my baby and see him breath. I loved the fact that is was small and portable.BUT my baby outgrew it by the time he was 1 month and a half...and only 20 1/2 inches!!!as soon as he started to move around his bassinet, he got his head stuck in one of the sides of the co-sleeper perpendicular to his body ( i though he had broken his neck!!)I exchanged it for the Original version of this co-sleeper and I love it again..it is not portable as the mini, does not have wheels, it is not as eady to assemble, and definitely not light, but my baby still loves it, the mattress is still awesome and my baby sleeps through the night and he is only 3 months..."
4,Great Idea,"I have been hounded by tons of well-meaning friends to sleep with my baby. Nonetheless, my husband and I do not feel safe with this option, no matter how sleepless our nights sometimes are. This is a GREAT alternative to the Dr. Sears-popularized ""family bed"" idea, and its unquestionably safe. I can recognize my baby's gurgles and grunts of hunger before it reaches a cry. Also, if she's a bit squirmy, I can reach over and console her with some warm touches (this of course doesn't always work).This is a great product."
3,OK but has some issues,"I registered for this when I was pregnant with my daughter believing that she would sleep in it next to our bed. Well, first of all, the ""mattress"" that it comes with is extremely hard and very thin. She did not like it at all. The first night we put her in it, she cried. Figuring that was what babies do, we continued to try to get her to sleep in it. She wouldn't even nap in it. We ended up just using her crib and she is fine with that. I believe it was because the mattress it comes with is very uncomfortable. On the bright side, my cats loved to sleep in it. I am going to keep it because you are supposed to be able to use it for toys. So we are going to put her toys in it and leave it in the play room."
2,Meh.,"It is nice having my daughter right there next to me and I don't have to worry about rolling over on her. I must say though, she hates it! The mattress is so hard I may as well lay her on my floor. She just tosses and turns and grunts. Her poor little head just looks so uncomfortable! and the side of the mattress closest to my bed kind of sinks down and she ends up rolling over and sliding down with her face right up against the side of the sleeper! I also don't like how there is a million pieces of velcro everywhere. Good idea but needs much improvement."
4,I love this item!,"I absolutely love the Mini Co-Sleeper! It's great having my son at eye level. And the length is such that it's not impossible for me to get in and out of bed even with a night table, which is why I chose the mini over the original. But I really wish it also converted into a play yard, like the original co-sleeper does. Great for changing too!"
4,(((( SHEET PROBLEMS ))))),"FOR SHEET PROBLEMS:I have found great sheets for this co-sleeper at Shopko. They were 'bassinet' sheets called ""PEEK A BABE"" which were about 4 dollars and are very comfortable (cotton that feels more like jersey material). I did buy the original sheets that come with the co-sleeper, but they were VERY expensive and they had really rough material...really a poor choice by the designer/manufactuer of the sheets! I would NOT buy extra sheets for the price of the co- sleeper sheets and for the harsh fabric.Actaully, I have found other 'bassinet' sheets that fit just fine for the co- sleeper too, but I really liked the Shopko ""PEEK A BABE"" brand - they also have Crib and Play yard sheets that are great and CHEAP too by the same brand. Sad to say, but I never use the sheets that came with the co-sleeper and I am thinking about selling them on Ebay (reason for the 4 stars otherwise a great product).hope this helps~Sandra~"
4,Really good for co sleeping families,"I recieved this before my daughter was born last Feb. It's still set up in my room, and she's almost 11 months old. I use it next to my bed as a buffer just in case now when I bring her into bed with me sometimes. When she was a newborn, she slept in this cosleeper daily. She slept in it until she was about 6-7 months old I believe. I only gave it 4 stars though because it wasn't that great to try to transfer a sleeping babe back into this cosleeper from your bed...I always had to get up to do this without waking my daughter. Otherwise, I really liked this cosleeper and still use it just about every night...although now I use it to prop pillows so my daughter cannot roll/crawl off the bed."
5,Love this item.,This is one of the best baby items that I have used. My baby is 3 1/2 months old and is 16lbs and is still sleeping comfortably in his co-sleeper. It is so nice to have him next to me at night and to be able to feed him without getting out of bed. I would recommend this product to anyone.
3,Nice but hard to set up,This co sleeper is a really nice idea to have your baby next to you at night but it is hard to get it set up. I about threw it through the window just trying to get all the sides up and locked. The directions are a joke that came with it also. My daughter hated it from the beginning too. She sleeps with her arms straight out and her hands would touch the sides of the co sleeper and make scraching noises. Annoying for her and me. Im sure it is wonderful for most parents and their babies but I think its a little to small. I would go for the regular sized one next time and not the mini.
2,New product's chemical smell was unbearable,"This co-sleeper has a lot of positive reviews, and from what I could see it was a sturdy well-built item that must be convenient for many parents.However, I am sensitive to chemicals and right after we opened the package I became violently ill from the odor. I have not been this sick from a chemical smell in at least a year, and we have purchased many other new items since. Given how sick it made me, I would never want that type of smell near my newborn baby.If you do buy this item, air it out for at least a day or two before you bring it anywhere near your baby."
5,Couldn't Live Without It,"We tried the crib and the pack-n-play with no sleep. A friend of ours bought this for us and it was the answer to our prayers.With a ""high needs baby"" (as Dr. Sears would call her), our daughter wanted to sleep with us which was way too dangerous. This was the answer. She could sleep safely next to me and I could keep my arm beside her so that she could feel my warmth and smell me. She finally started to sleep.This would be a MUST HAVE on my list if I were to do it again!"
3,Lack's support,"We have had our son in this co-sleeper 8 weeks. We have assembled it per the instructions and one of the bottom connections will not lock. We have tried many times to get the support to lock and it will not do so. My husband rigged it so that there is tension, but it is not correct. Even with the support not locking there is no mattress support in the center of the mattress. It lightly sags in the middle.Even with the above it is nice to have him right next to me at night. If the above things were not an issue for us we would love this co-sleeper. We do regret purchasing it though."
3,"Good, but needed adjustments","Our baby is due in a few weeks, so I can only speak on initial set up right now.We got this product because we are committed to co-sleeping, but only have a full bed, which is too small for us to have baby in bed comfortably. This was easy to set up, HOWEVER:1) We have a normal height bed and this does not sit flush with our mattress.2) We bought bed risers from Bed Bath and Beyond, removed the wheels from the sleeper, and placed the co-sleeper on the risers. Seems to have solved problem. (Arms Reach extenders were pricey and I read that they were pretty unstable.) Bed risers were 10 dollars.3) Mattress is extremely hard and seemed of poor quality. We coughed up $130 for the organic mattress, which is better.4) Had to place towels and cardboard underneath mattress to get it to sit flush with the lip that connects to bed. In my opinion, if it's not totally flush and ""one"" with your bed, why even have this product? I would have bought a pack n play or bassinet."
4,Wonderful adventure in a land of illusion,"In this colossal adventure for levels 28-32 (!), an entire city is warped out of existence by the dark Arch-Magus, Durhan the Conquerer. Sundering the realm and summoning an enormous army to conquer the surrounding lands, only the PCs stand between the legendary sorcerer and the obliteration of their homelands. But how can they recover a city and its populace if the city no longer exists? Well, warp reality until you find the impossible... a fascinating land, and an intriguing adventure."
3,There are better recordings...,"I love the Guarneri Quartet. I have had the privilege of hearing them live on multiple ocassions. But even at such a discount price I would skip these recordings. The sound is muddled. If you compare these discs to the Alban Berg recordings on Teldec, you will hear a truly significant difference in quality. These are some of the most beautiful Quartets in the world. Buy the Berg."
4,"Baker and Catherine in Zagreb, Croatia","There is some fine interplay between the great trumpet player and singer Chet and the great Belgian guitar player Philip Catherine, there are some fine solos all-around,some interesting piano and drums work by Chet (sparse and elegant, what did you think?) and it was a wise decision to invite the elegant alto-sax player Allan Praskin to drop by in the end(since the bass player didn't show up for this gig in Zagreb)...Basically, although I liked this CD quite a lot, this will not become my favorite Chet Baker album - MAYBE it's because I didn't care for Catherine's occasional attempts to substitute the bass(I prefer his harmonic/melodic work). BUT if you like either Chet or Catherine, you should get this album for your collection. I'm giving it 4 stars although the ACTUAL grade would be 4 and a half if it was possible...."
1,Bright Orange Warning Sign,"The author of this book, whose writing chops appear to have been honed primarily by his experiences as editor of his college newspaper, presents the face of a person who is both self-aware and soul-searching, but against the larger context of the recycled right wing tripe (Republican = Christian; Democrat = Atheist; No other options exist) he publishes on his personal weblog, the projected circumspection is frankly difficult to believe. The single most effective line in the entire volume: ""If nothing else...when this is all over I'll be able to say that I spent the night in a Mexican jail."" This bit of dark humor is overshadowed by the poorly executed ""Blue-Haired Conservative,"" a piece largely composed of self-important boasting (""Ooh, look at me, I'm gnarly AND a republican AND totally original!"") and personal propaganda. If that sort of writing turns your crank, by all means, buy this book."
1,Sleep dry,"Everyone reacts differently to various supplements. I got a very severe case(s) of drymouth using the Sleep Formula, which I have never encountered before with any supplement or medication. The side effects make the product unusable for me."
2,It's BORING.,"Been reading a whole slew of WWII histories recently. This on isn't quite as bad as Tuskeegee Airmen - I slogged about halfway through that one before I returned it to the library. This starts off ok, but loses focus very quickly. There are only like two maps in the book, and entire chapters seem to cover areas not covered on the maps. It becomes a book of details that tells the history, not a history that includes details. It doesn't hold my interest - actually it is great to read at night on the bedstand. Ten pages puts me right to sleep."
3,Informational,"My father was a staff sargent in the 3rd Marines who landed there. I suppose I wanted to better understand his ordeals. He lived through it, but never spoke of it once.I think the book is definitely worth reading! I have seen other materials on this protracted engagement, and all have something to offer.In terms of writing style, the book reads a bit like older pieces, in a style that is not quite elegant, but certainly readable. It is not an exciting book, however, with a notable few sections.And yes, we are somehow related to Albert C. Wedemeyer, general in the Army at that time."
2,Film appears dated but content good,"I was shocked that this expensive DVD series seems to have been filmed about thirty years ago, the film colours and quality is of a poor quality. The content is not about secrets but is commonly held beliefs about everything. We still today are not able to build the pyramids and how they built them is still a mystery but this DVD will have you believe that the anicent eqyptians built them, when there wasn't even any trees in the area, just like now, so they couldn't even have rolled the stones.... I however watched this whole series and found it fasinating."
3,Great cook book,"This book is great if you want tutorials without clear explanation. It is more of an instruction manuel on how to reproduce a scene than teaching how create and think on your own. The problem with this approach is you finish a tutorial, pat yourself on the back for making something, but later realize that you did not fully understand what you did. If you are an expert in lighting with other programs, but need to transition over to Maya, then this is a great book for explaining how the tools work. If you are new to lighting or rendering this is not the best book for you, but it is okay for reference.The DVD is a waste. Mainly because all the screen shots of the computer screen are out of focus. Not a bad book, but not great either."
2,No band but still making $$$,"It was a shame to see Creed breakup, but Scott's ego was too big for the band to exist. I do like the CD, with the exception of ""Hide"" not on the CD. The CD was obviously an obligation to fulfill the agreement between the record company and the band. The reason I gave this 2 stars is because they could have made the DVD much better. We as fans have already paid for these songs once and deserve a better effort. The least they could have done was put together a live DVD and sold this as a separate product. I know the footage exists; just make the DVD and make all fans happy. By the way, the DVD's 3 live songs are sad when you consider all of the footage that Creed has available."
3,good cd,This was used. I wish when people sell used things they make sure that they have the case that go with them.
3,Hey Morons!,"Hey Morons!1) Creed does not sound like Pearl Jam!2) Creed is (was) not a Christian rock band!3) If you don't like them, like what they sound like, or like what their music is about, why are you reviewing anything of theirs?Stay off Creed's reviews! I don't go onto your ABBA or Boy George sites!We've got the songs, but the videos are worth having."
2,Im sorry people,"i just listened through all the songs, listening carefully and the only good song i heard was One Last Breath.Pearl Jam was so much better than this band. Pearl Jam's ""Ten"",which was their first album, is 10X better than Creed's Greatest Hits. This band just tries to copy Pearl Jam. If you listen to 5 seconds of any of their songs you'll say,"" This sounds like a bad Pearl Jam song"".And some of you Creed fans are just plain stupid. Like that guy a little farther down who's like,"" yo homie Geeees Creed's awesome yo, i just wish they had more hip-hop like 50 Cent yo.""And the people who say Pearl Jam are Creed posers!?!?!??!??!!?!?Creed created grunge!?!? Ive never heard something so wrong in my life. You people are mainstream ""homies""."
3,"2 for the music, 3 for the correct choices","My question is this- why?Why bother buying this Creed album when you can just buy a couple of their regular albums? Even though those albums aren't really anything to write home about either- since after all, Creed was VERY similar to Pearl Jam, and choosing either of the two bands isn't a bad idea either. Just pick which band you like more, and go with that one.I really never liked ""Higher"" but it's a hit song so it makes sense that it's featured here. The other songs are all alright as well, but again, Creed or Pearl Jam? Which one do you like more?"
1,One question....WHY???,"So here we are with a Creed Greatest Hits cd. Wow. This band made 3 albums of the most unoriginal music, and get a ""Greatest Hits"" album. Well, here are the facts.1. Creed isn't as good as you think they are.2. Scott Stapp cannot sing.3. Creed is no more, stop your crying.All in all, a waste of money for a load of songs that we're all worse off for having been exposed to."
1,"So, you're about to buy this album! My advice...DON'T!","Supposed to be 0 stars. This is a CD full of Creed's smash hits. In my opinion, I don't think they're hits. They're trashy songs that belong in a junkyard. The only good song is ""With Arms Wide Open."" The rest belong's in the junkyard! I'm sick of this! I can't wait to sell this thing on eBay tomorrow, because I want to get rid of this! You're probably thinking, Why did I buy it? Well, I only bought it because of ""With Arms Wide Open."" Big mistake! (This was before I got an iPod and downloaded iTunes.)My advice:DON'T BUY THIS!DON'T BUY THIS!DON'T BUY THIS!DON'T BUY THIS!Still not convinced? Well too bad, because you'll regret buying it. Trust me. You want good music? Then get ""A Rush of Blood to the Head"" by Coldplay! Coldplay is so better than Creed! And also try these other good bands:TravisRadioheadOasisMuseKeaneJetRazorlightThe KillersKaiser ChiefsThe HivesLinkin ParkBut still, Coldplay is my favorite band of all time! Creed is nonsense!"
1,Wow This Is Trash,"I cannot believe how bad this CD blows. It is by far the worst CD I have ever heard. The only reason I know is because my 12 year old brother and his gay friends got scammed into buying it. I would hear nails on a chalkboard then that DRUNK of a leadsinger play ""Arms Wide Open."" If someone offers you this CD for free do not take it. Peace I'm Out Homo's."
4,"CD Good, DVD eh","Was delivered in perfect condition and works great. However, the DVD doesnt give you an option to watch all of the concerts consecutively, you have to individually go back to the main menu and choose the next in line.Other then that, great sound"
4,Great rock band Christian or not,"If you're a die-hard Creed fan you probably already have the original 3 cd's which makes this one unnecessary.If, like me, you simply like the tunes you've heard on the radio or elseswhere, then this cd is a must have.I had no idea this was a Christian rock band until a friend told me so. (I'm listening to the lyrics a bit more now)I read some nasty reviews of this cd which prompted me to write my own. I think that if someone truly ""hates"" a particular music group, their review of that artist is clearly biased and therefore bogus and a waste of our time."
4,creed kid,pearl jelly suz creed is better i think creed could have made more alblums but they made three and that is fine with me and besides creed is better than pearl jelly
1,creed sucks....nuff said.,"This is why you shouldn't buy this album. Creed is a terrible band. Every time I heard Scott Stap's whiny grunting I wanted to kill myself. The talent level of the group is average at best with Stap's singing (if you can even call that singing) making everything they played sound depressing. It didn't matter what the lyrics were or what the music was like, Stap made it sound depressing.Save your money."
3,More Bang for Your Buck,"For the money, this is a great buy for any Creed fan! It comes with a DVD containing the videos for each song on the CD; so even if you have all 3 of the other Creed albums you'll be getting something previously unexplored, a reasonably priced treasure.On a personal note, I bought this disk for ""My Sacrifice"" and ""With Arms Wide Open."" (They weren't sold as single downloads via WalMart or i-tunes.) Believe it or not, I had never heard any of the other songs on the CD before except ""One Last Breath"", and I didn't recognize the title before listening to the CD. After listening to the CD I'm not impressed by the other songs. However, the CD does come with a print out of the lyrics for each song, and that does please me greatly.To each his own. Rock on Creed disciples!"
4,i use to hate creed but then i gave them a chance...,"and realized they werent as bad as most people say they are. this is a good greatest hits package but i agree with some of the reviewers...why release a greatest hits cd with only 3 full length album? alter bridge made me realize that creed was a good band after hearing mark's tremendous work on ONE DAY REMAINS. i gave it 4 stars only because there were only 13 songs in here, if they put 2 new ones or a couple of live songs at the end it wouldve been alot better. they also couldve enhanced the sound quality so they dont sound so much as the studio albums. but hey this is a better package than Guns N' Roses greatest hits."
2,Does anyone else see the problem with this.....,"It's so obvious, it makes me sick. CORPORATE TYRANTS TRYING TO MAKE MONEY ON A BAND WHO HAD 3 ALBUMS. Just another case of the record company trying to cash in on something that doesnt exist. That being Creed's ""Greatest Hit's"". No doubt about it - My Own Prison album was amazing. After that, c'mon now. I'm patiently awaiting a Creed - Mediocre Radio Hits album for early '05. Please. This is the reason why people download songs off the 'net - is because record companies treat us like crap, giving us albums like these. The wool is not over my eyes..."
1,Warning!!!,"If you listen to this CD backward, you'll hear hidden Satanic messages. Even worse, if you play it forward, you'll hear Creed."
1,Uh.....Creed had hits?,"Creed released a ""Greatest Hits"" package after they broke up? How can you release some as a ""Hits"" package when it is nothing more then a bunch of garguling, Pearl Jam-wanna-be, trash that shows no musical talent at all. If you want some nice coasters, buy this package."
1,it sounds like they need the exlax to me,"I may not be old yet but I am to old to see this group is thinking to be just like Pearl jam, but even theyre voices sound the same as Pearl jam. You know, like in Seatle, everyone hast to sing like they didnt get all the prunes and there sitting and, you know, sitting, reading the newspaper...and making the creed voice, I mean the grunge voice, that kind of push sounding voice I think it is so for all the Seatle bands, like its not coming out easy, like most people. That is this band Creed, I think they should not try to sound like Eddie Veder and they should sound like there own selvs instead of some other guys self."
1,WHERE'S THE HITS!!!!,"Creed is my favoritest band, and I wants the HITS!!These songs were just the radio singles. NOT the hits. at least not as I seee them.Where are ""Jesus is my bra"", ""When I grow up I wanna be a rocker"", ""Grunge and God and mother mary"", ""David Cross owns me at Poker"", ""I'm confused"", and ""Singing lessons are for wusses"" !!!"
5,All the best!!,Simply one awesome song after another!! Put the first track on and was not unhappy with any of the selections.
4,Decent Album,Easy to download. Some good songs on the album. Got it discounted so that was a plus. Many different albums to chose from the music library.
3,Censored,"The CD was great. However, I did not like the fact that they censored the original recording. They should indicate that on the product description."
5,...,"Kid, if you had ears, maybe you'd understand that Ten is a rock album. Creed's music is well put together and great to listen to, Tremonti's guitar playing has earned him a comfortable position in the Electric Guitar hierarchy. The bass and drumming compliment each other well and succeed in laying down a good basis for the guitar and vocals to work upon. The vocals are powerful and the lyrical content is very well written. This is a good selection of some of their best songs, and makes a great album. Please stop whining about who created what type of music, or who's music is better, just respect the music for what it is and what it has achieved, stop labelling yourselves. Enjoy it."
3,"Good band, bad DVD.","I like Creed. So why three stars? Simply because it could have been better. It has all the greatest hits and all the videos, and only three live performances. That's all...they could have added much more. Tracks that we never heard before, or even more mroe live performances. It's a shame they made a bad Greatest Hits album for such a good band.For diehard Creed funs, buy it and save yourself the guilt of knowing you never bought your favorite band's Greatest Hits album. For some random passerby, you might find you have wasted your money"
3,I don't own this CD..........,"I know all of the Creed songs. My wife has the ""Weathered"" CD, my son has the ""Human Clay"" CD, and my friend has the ""My own Prison"" CD. I like some of Creed's songs but not the majority of them. I was really interested in buying this ""Greatest Hits"" CD until I discovered my favorite track wasn't on the CD. My favorite song from Creed is ""Who's got my Back?"". Awesome song.Too bad all the corporate music people only include the radio hits on today's ""greatest hits"" CD's. I will NOT be purchasing this CD thanx to the greedy corporate music executives......"
1,greatest hits after 3 albums..rip off,Why anyone would want to buy this most over-rated bands hits album is beyond me.If they had produced a body of work from say 6 or 7 albums then I might give it some credit.
2,Nice but to much hype,The cd is ok. creed is a good band. I have seen scott saythat it is christian new rock era in a interview. Huh?So many of you review's cut down the band come on get a life.Go spred your sadness some were else. The band did the best jobthey could under scott. Now a greatest hit's cd. Now I haveto say that is silly. I have band's that have 10 cd's out nobox set or nothing. So let's be fair and let's be nice theywere a good band and if creed or scott removed the name ofgod in that song like the bible said if you can not admit yoursin's in front of man how can I in front of my father.I trying to say is if they were afraid or just not thinkinggod know's everything he will take care of it so relax andsell the cd and keep the one they did not leave out god'sname. I hoped I help you.
3,"Without any good PJ, somebody stepped up","I liked most of what of I heard from this group, the adversarial nature of Pearl Jam fans spite notwithstanding. I guess if you hate this group for whatever reason, fine. Is it true this band is ""Christian""? Hmmm, maybe I WILL hate them. Anyway, I like a number of songs here. I find myself pretending Ed Vedder is doing the singing. I wish it was him. Sorry, but Pearl Jam really lost their ear for good tunes a long time ago. Sometimes the imitators rise up and push the originals aside with success."
2,readers will cringe,"Pietrusza's portrait of the Squire is not without its flaws. Typos are too frequent. Some words, like soon and merely, are used repetitiously; Hampton L. Carson is represented as ""Hampton L. Carlson."" Pietrusza also commits redundancies and is too enamored of stilted adverbial phrases. In addition, some readers will cringe at Pietrusza's space allocation: large sections are given over to explanations and clarifications of cases and issues where Landis's name fails to be mentioned, and substantial sections also deal with characters only peripherally associated with Landis."
3,Judge Landis-- a complicated case,"Hard to tell what to think of the judge. He was kind to the downtrodden on one hand, but overly harsh on the other. Cases in point are the 1919 White Sox players like Buck Weaver (who played no role) and Shoeless Joe Jackson (merely suckered along for the ride). Can't help feeling sorry for Eddie Cicotte either as he was clearly screwed by Comiskey and forced to fight back for the dignity of his family-- wrong method, but right motive.However, the blackest mark on the judge has to be his role in keeping black players out of the game. Bill Veeck wanted to put them on his St.Louis Browns team a full decade before Jackie Robinson and would have done so without Landis blatant interference. The game was not integrated (for this century) until Landis did the owners a favor by croaking."
5,A GREAT BIO!,A GREAT READ. I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED IT AND RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE INTERESTED IN BASEBALL OR AMERICAN HISTORY.
2,Poor Quality Vocals,"I have found this recording/production disappointing and quite frustrating. 1) the vocal quality is low (out of tune, odd additions to vocal lines) 2) the track titles DO NOT line up with the actual titles of the songs 3) the orchestration is VERY cheap sounding. Buy something else - don't waste your money if you're looking for a decent recording of this show!"
1,Terrible!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The instruments are fine, but the vocals, both lead and backup, are TERRIBLE. Not only are they of poor voice quality, but often they are off pitch!!!!!!!!!!"
2,A broad survey,"I was looking for something with more depth. This scratches a very broad surface of the more popular rides. One can get much of this info on the Internet, perhaps making this book obsolete."
4,Battle from the top,"I found the book ""Amphibious Assault falklands"" very interesting. It gives us the perspective of one of the leaders of the campain, and shows us all the considerations and planning before the assult. Together with the book ""No picninc"" I think this in one of the most informative books about the war, if you want to know the war from the top."
4,Know the topic...,"Whoever reads the review complaining about the book being laden with details about logistics and communication problems, IGNORE IT. I've been the world's finest amphibious force since 1989 and began my career as a young stud who cared only for kicking in doors and slitting throats. The simple fact of the matter is that, as much as it pains me to say it as an infantryman, professionals actually do think logistics and amateurs think tactics. If you can't supply your grunts with the ammo, chow, and water they need to continue the mission then you FAIL. No ammo? Your blade and hands are all you have. No chow or water? Simple biology shows us the human machine needs fuel...a FACT. Yes, logistics and communications problems make for very boring reads, but students of amphibious warfare MUST understand the complexity of planning their logistics and communications into their operations."
4,Good book,I bought this book for help on an exchange project I was working on. The book was vey helpful and informative. it even brought up some points I did not think of.The only down side of the book is that the layout makes it king of hard to read.
5,The LAST Exchange 2003 book you'll ever need!,"This is, by far, the best Exchange 2003 book I've ever studied!"
2,non-stick is a flexible term,"The coating is strong, but textured, and not non-stick. These pans are designed to sear meat, or to cook sauces.High-heat on soft foods will definitely cook the food onto the pan. Granted, splashes on the sides, and small spots do clean up easily, but things that burn or encrust on the bottom are tough to remove.Luckily, the coating is very durable and scrubby-pads and metal spatulas can be used on them."
4,"Good, Lighthearted family drama","Farrah Fawcett stars as Frannie a carefree, frivolous and fun woman who returns home to Silk Hope on her Mother's passing. The movie portrays her attempts to hold on to the family home (her sister and fiance want to sell it) whilst learning to be responsible and changing as a person.The movie is light hearted with some genuinely funny moments, (Frannie and the pigs), pathos, and drama. Farrah Fawcett is wonderful and is abley supported by Brad Johnson as the love interest.Worthwhile."
5,Great Value,These CDs are an excellent value. Seller shipped immediately and they were well packaged.
2,Shipping,"The CD-R worked great and recommend them to anyone, but when they arrived, some of CD-Rs were not sealed in it's container."
3,"Flat surface, large inner non-printable area.","Unlike other Taiyo Yuden/JVC discs I used these have:A flat surface (not glossy)Longer drying timesHave a large margin in middle (others I've used you can print up to the hole).I'll try to find the glossy white ones again, that look WAY better, dry instantly, and have much larger printing areas."
5,Worked like a charm,"I popped the old one off, and the new one went right on. Only problem is that they advertise everything you need is in the box, but it is recommended you use a gasket sealer that is not included. No big deal. Three months later and it is still working without complaint."
4,Worked As Expected,The product arrived in a timely fashion and in good condition. It worked as expected. Very pleased with the price.
2,Beware,"I purchased this to use with a FoodSaver V3240. I finally ran out of my other bags and tried to use these. Couldn't get them to work. They appear to be just a little too long so the vacumm channel will not hold them closed to suck out the air. I only had one to go so I changed what I did not continuing to try to get these.I see some folks are getting them to work fine and some are not so beware, they may be a hassle to get to work. The bags are very well made and I hope to come up with something that will allow me to use them"
2,not very happy,dosnt not vaquum corectly rolls are thin not happy thanksten or more words dosnt make anny diference its wasting time
5,Great calcium at excellent price,"I have osteoporosis. For over 2 years I spent a lot of money on what I thought was superior calcium from the health food store. Each bottle cost over $30.00. I have a new doctor and he told me it was not necessary to spend so much money. I have taken Twin Lab calcium for almost a year and my recent blood work indicated that this calcium is being absorbed excellently in my body. This calcium is a very good value, easily and effectively absorbed. Why overspend?"
3,"Useful, but photographic reference would be better","Bridgman gets a lot of credit for his mastery as an illustrator. Nevertheless, as a tool this book would have been more useful with photographic references of hands in various positions. By using Bridgman's illustrations as a guide, you end up simply aping his style to some extent. The end result is like when you photocopy a photocopy: a little grainier, much muddier version of the original."
2,What is this book for?,"Certainly not for helping you learn to draw hands! I bought this book to help me to understand the difficult anatomy of the hand, but it's just a collection of very rough line sketches reproduced on a small and grainy scale, with basically no instruction. There's no denying Bridgman was a master, but I can't get practical information out of his loose sketches. Sometimes I can't even tell what position a hand is in, much less use it as a reference. A book of photographs, or a drawing tutorial, would be a better choice for someone at the beginning or intermediate level. I haven't found a whole book devoted to the hand yet, but the few pages of information in ""Drawing the Head and Figure"" (ISBN 0399507914) are fifty times more useful to me than this book."
3,"good anatomy, but falls short","This is a very good book to teach you how the hand works. It demonstrates how the muscles pull and knuckles jut or decline depending on the position of the hand. It also demonstrates bones and ligaments well, how each finger has three hinge joints, except the thumb, which only has two, where the palm is fleshy and where it lies flat. Reading through the book can help you gain a better understanding of the anatomy of the hand.Unfortunatley this book does fall short in some aspects, some of the images are so sketchy and blurred, it is difficult to tell that they are hands, much less to practice from the drawings and achieve the desired results. Following the examples in the book will not improve the clarity of your drawings of one of the most difficult subjects: the human hand. But the anatomy lesson makes this book worth getting anyway."
3,More like book of 100 partially drawn hands,"There are a lot of interesting images of hand in this book, and yes, many of them are done well. However there are also a lot of images of hands that are hard to interpret because they are not completely drawn and are in an awkward position. The text around the hands is also useful. Part of the book is not as helpful as other parts. It's an okay source, but if I had to pick between this and another source, I would have gone with another."
4,Great!,"A great book! A wonderful resource for hands that will keep you coming back for reference. Not so great for learning to draw hands, but instead to better understand structure, weight, and form."
2,disorginized confusing sketches,"This book is not for beginners. To understand this book you'll need to have a good understanding of the hand's anatomy, but if you already understand the hand then this book will be useless. Some pages are organized so on the left will be a description like ""the pinky sticks out at this angle"", then on the right will be an ink blot test looking drawing where you can't even see the pinky. A good alternative to this is Burne Hogarth's ""Drawing Dynamic Hands""."
3,If You Need a Second Look at Hands,"Can be an alternative (different views are always valuable) or an augmentation to Hogarth. The drawings are sketchy rather than firm. He takes anatomy a too deep (bones, tendons, deep muscles, then finally what shows under the skin), but the pose you're looking for may be in here. My library could live without it, but it's nice to have."
2,DISAPOINTED,"I WAS DISAPOINTED IN THE BOOK. I WAS HOPING FOR A LOT MORE PICTURES ON HANDS, THE WAY THE PICTURES WERE DISPLAYED WERE IN A MEDICAL MANNER."
3,Relax.It's only a trip...to Hell.,This was one of the best psychological thrillers I've seen in years.Rutger Hauer shines as the hero.
3,ok,"This all been done before, and in a more effective way (Dead calm and Point break), but it's still mildly entertaining.It's an interesting cast which saves it.Rutger Hauer is as reliable as always, although looking a little on the unfit side.Eric Roberts contributes one of his usual evil performances that come so naturally to him.Overall: unremarkable, but worth a look."
5,if u like t.a.t.u in jewels new cd youll love fefe,oh my god this gurl rocks she can sing in come on its about time we have another female singer with rocks beats instand of pop beats fefe rocks ya should go buy this cd now cuz youlllove this singel in if u love the singel ull love the cd so what ya waiting 4 go buy this cd now ya know ya want to beside youll love hersong title-''take me away''-10/10 love the song great vocals in good ass beats overall she rocks
2,2 1/2 Stars for Take Me Away,The only good song on this single is Take Me Away. Bye Bye Boyfriend is one of the worst songs ever. It should have been on Vh1's and Blender magazines 50 worst songs ever. Don't waste your time with Fefe's debut album either. It's a stinker!
3,A for effort!,"She's not bad, but my biggest problem with Fefe is the total lack of uniqueness with her voice. Although sometimes it's good to hear two or more different artists with just about the same sound, that's not the case here with Fefe. This sound should have been left to Avril and Michelle Branch. Honestly, it sounds like a random girl singing karaoke with a rock song.If she had more of an edgy rock voice a la Pink, or even Christina Aguilera, or something stylish like Gwen Stefani I WOULD HAVE LOVED THESE TRACKS. But she doesn't, so I didn't care for them that much. Even Avril is in much better class.Bottom line, it's good. That's it. No wow factor because there have been others of the same mold before her. But she's worth a try. The songs overall aren't shabby. Make sure you take a couple test spins first, here or in the music store."
1,oh boy,"When I heard about fe fe dobson coming on to the music scene I wanted to like her. That is until I heard her songs. Man they suck. Too bad, she has potential. I hope to hear something else that makes me change my mind."
1,Really Bad...,"This song is horrible! The vocals are really bad, and there is just nothing special about the song. Fe Fe Dobson is supposed to be one of the new breeds of Avril, but she is nowhere near Avril. (And this is coming form someone who can't stand Avril, though I like some of her songs!) The music video doesnt help at all, and this is just a really bad song. I dont reccomend it at all!"
2,the cd,the cd was decent. she has talent. she just has to work at it and she'll become as good as mariah carey in no time.
5,Take me away...very very catchy tune,"For those that like fun catchy tunes this one's got it all! I see Fefe as an up and coming Superstar in the Pop/Rock arena..I'll be looking forward to more of her stuff if it's as good as ""Take me Away""! I haven't seen any comparisons written about her voice comparing to Michelle Branch, but the first time I heard ""Take me Away"" I thought it was a new release from Michelle Branch....anyways, I love the song! Best of luck to Fefe's future!!"
3,Take the Good With the Bad.,"""Take Me Away"" is a really good song! Great music, and even better lyrics. FeFe Dobson did well vocally. Her voice really suited the beat.""Bye Bye Boyfriend"", on the other hand, is a terrible song! The main chorus is her practically yelling ""bye, bye, Boyfriend"" with just as bad of music playing in the background. I occassionally make fun of this song.So, it's up to you whether or not you want to buy this single. Personally, I'd rather buy her album, which has both these songs on it. Then, you can have other good songs besides ""Take Me Away"", and hopefully less bad songs."
1,More Nonsense,"More postmodern nonsense from one of the usual suspects, the fellow who brought us ""The Gulf War Did Not Take Place."" As usual, the most craven appeasement is dressed up as some sort of profound philosophy. I wonder if it were Baudrillard's relatives who were murdered whether he'd be so quick to conclude that it is useless to fight back. But I fear the answer would be the same. God help the West if this is what we've come to. Is there anything we're willing to fight for?"
5,beware the Kindle link,"Lydia Davis's translation of Swann's Way is a great addition to the language. That's not the issue, though. At the top of the page there's a note to the effect that this book is available in a Kindle edition, but the link is not to Davis's translation. Rather, it goes to the Modern Library version, which is a very good update of the old Scott Moncrieff translation from the 1920s.Personally, I like the new 'Penguin Proust' -- liked it so much, indeed, that I bought and read the Modern Library editions. They are excellent, but they are not the same thing.If you are up to reading À la recherche du temps perdu on a small digital screen, be awfully careful where you shop. The Kindle bookstore is full of bandit editions, several of which link to the new translations in order to steal their cover artwork and reader reviews. (This review of mine will no doubt appear on one of them. I hope it does some good!) Caveat lector."
2,Another classic disappointment...,"This is the ""Seinfeld"" of literature: a long, drawn-out narrative about *nothing*. There are, however, other infinitely more enjoyable books that deal with memories and non-linear time. In my opinion, if a person is going to write a 3,000+ page self-reflective epic, he better be an interesting person, and this narrator is simply not one. At least not on any page of this introductory volume. Maybe he becomes interesting in a subsequent volume, but this one does not inspire me to attempt to find this out. I can appreciate the fact that this work was revolutionary in Proust's time, but I submit that in ours, it is more of a cure for insomnia than the literary masterpience it is cracked up to be."
2,Needs an OFF button!,This toy is cute but it has no ON/OFF button! Why do manufacturers do that?!?! It's loud and has a tendency to start making noise by itself sometimes (which is REALLY annoying when it starts tweeting in my toddler's room while he is sleeping!) We finally had to put it all the way down in the basement to avoid being jolted awake in the middle of the night. We received it as a gift but I never buy toys that makes sounds if they don't have an OFF button. So annoying!!
2,Poorly written,The book has numerous typographical errors. The design of the book without page numbers seems odd especially if you have to reference it. Some of the information on the past seems redundant to people just entering the business.
1,99 problems and this movie is one.,"Now, upon scrolling through my movie options in the horror section, I came upon this and its vague description and figured why not. A HUGE MISTAKE. This film is completely ridiculous with a plot and execution of dialogue that was unbearable. A married couple are held captive in their own home by a sadistic killer and forced to reveal ""secrets"" to each to survive and complete a puzzle of sin. Its an awkward combination of Saw and Captivity but with no gore to hold your attention and the two main characters seemed far to relaxed about having a serial killer watching over them. Even going as far as to pull out a board game to kill some time. WHAT?! Anyway, its a piece of garbage and the twist at the end wasn't even shocking enough to make 5 minutes of this film worth it. PLEASE, go find something else to watch."
5,best candian ska?,"Ska....ahhhh yes good moving ska without all the riff-raff that comes with punk-ska. The lyrics are great and the instrumentation is even better, what can i say? Great ska....five stars...my favorite band. All the albums are great, buy em all.Simon"
3,"Funky smell, good taste","I was disappointed when I opened the first bag as there is a strong rancid like smell. I looked at the expiration date, and it supposed to last until 2014. I opened a second bag, and the smell seems to be rancid as well, but somewhat less. I opened the second one thinking that maybe, it is just one bag, and I didn't want to deal with the hassle of returning it. Now, I did not use poppy seeds for baking ever, and I'm trying to figure out if these seeds developed the rancidity because of the packaging or are they supposed to smell funky? I bought flour from the same brand, and it was excellent. Did someone have the same experience?"
1,Good for COOKING,"These are excellent seeds for COOKING, and these seeds are certainly high quality... but if you're looking to get HIGHLY impressive reviews about your seeds and where you get them I would look elsewhere. They are VERY CLEAN.For cooking they're great I suppose. PST no."
1,"Red Mill is usually good ,but......",These seeds are stale. I opened all 8 to make sure it was not just one bag....all 8 were bad. Amazon was great and credited my account. The date was for 2014...so they must have been in a hot warehouse before being shipped. Am going to try another brand.
3,Great product!,These seeds are Great for COOKING and very Clean and processed. If you want truly unwashed seeds for a great price try the Frontier brand.
3,Good - but a bit too much on the generic side.,"My Maxima is getting old but I really love it and hope to keep it going for a while longer. This manual contains much useful information and is worth having. But it does lack detail on many things I need to know. Like finding and fixing the EGR valve on a 1996 model. I suspect the Nissan service manual or Haynes manual would have better details, although I have not read either."
5,Page turner,"This book is well written and thought provoking. The concepts covered are presented in an interesting way, with narrative and testimonial throughout."
1,Gun sights with no instructions just left to figure out or call,The gun sights came with no instructions and were left to call or guess what and how to install the sights. Quality looks OK but again don't really know if the sights will fit need a press and Gunsmiths are very limited in the state of HI.
3,Not as bright as I expected,Sights are very reasonably priced compared to the store. Arrived in three business days. Sights are not as bright as I expected in low light or complete darkness but are far superior to the stock sights. Online pictures of these sights also do not show how bright they might be like some of the other brands do but you can't beat the price. I would recommend this product.
5,I love these,I think these are the best sights. They got here quick and they look great! They match the ones on my custom Nighthawk.
4,Thoughtful and Provocative,"This book deflates the claims by blowhard fundamentalists by looking at the Greek words used in Christian scriptures to dissociate modern fundamentalist mores from the concepts of the original authors (whomever they may be). A piercing and informed look at the nature of cleanliness (the argument against homosexuality is often because it's unclean, but you don't see Christians following the cleanliness laws of the Torah, do you?), possession/greed (faithfulness to one's partner or partners), and their relationship to sexuality and sexual ethics. I cannot recommend a better book for those who are on the edge of leaving christianity because of its repressive sexuality -- yet can't believe that it is SUPPOSED to be that way."
5,Perfect,"My Miata owning and loving father in law loved this sign, we bought it for his birthday and when he saw it he said it was awesome. And his miata is red so it matches the red letters on the sign. The sign is great quality metal not flimsy or cheap."
5,Good Lies for Ladies,"This book is delightful! Really, an attractive little book, that has drawings of professional women golfers (who knew there were so many?) and quotes and golf tips. It's just much more than I expected to find in a small, inexpensive book"
4,So Far So Good,Just bought this and it's been great so far. Still playing around with the settings. Love the wav and mp3 file formats. Software is very easy to use. The stereo mic(s) do a great job...sounds almost the same aswith my external mic!
2,Wont work with my Mac,I should have known. I read a lot or reviews and this seemed to be the product for me. The description says it supports wav and mp3 formats. Problem is you have to run the software on a PC to get that to happen. The msv file format is not compatible with a Mac. Looks like this is going back.
3,Soney ICD-SX57 Digital Voice Recorder MINUS Dragon Software,"The recorder works well although noise is a little bit of a problem.The main draw back is that it came without the Dragon software!This was misleading in the advertizement and product discription.On the product package itself it claims compatability with the Dragon software but says its not included and doesn't indicate which version of software it is compatible with.When serveying to buy this product I was mislead trying to compare products and prices. Some included the Dragon S/W and the other ones that did not include the S/W generally did NOT indicate it, so I was mis-led for price comparisons."
2,"OK, but just OK","I am a journalist and use the device for recording interviews. The weakness of this device is the Sony proprietary file format.If they would only record in MP3 format you could download, file and play from your computer. Instead I back up on the computer, erase and if later I want to refer back I have to reinstall onto the device to play. It sucks, what were they thinking."
5,inspiring...,"As a female student of the martial arts, I found this book very inspiring. Our lives as girls and women are often filled with men as role models, particularly in areas such as martial arts and certain sports, so this book offered a connection to other women out there who are leading powerful, peaceful lives helping themselves and in turn, others. I also like the structure of the book; you don't have to read it cover to cover, you can skip around & read the sections that catch your eye first. Also, the photos are realistic, they help show us that these are REAL women in REAL life, they are not model-types posing for appearance. The variety of women here is truly inspiring and made me want to find people like this in real life to connect with. And men: get this book for the woman martial artist in your life (or any woman searching for inner strength), she'll really feel you care about her, it was one of the best gifts I ever received from a guy! :-)"
5,Interesting reading,"I got this book after hunting and hunting for stories about women in the martial arts. I can't say I enjoyed all the stories, but I found most of them interesting. Some I could relate to and others I still cannot; however I still enjoy picking up the book and reading some of the women's stories, especially ones who started when women in general weren't 'allowed' to train in martial arts. I also have an older copy of Women in the Martial Arts (I think that's the title) and I enjoy reading through it too, but the size of this book makes it easier to handle I think."
1,Ingrid Seward should change her name,"I read this book ,two days ago,thanks to a friend who was polite enough to gave it to me before he was throwing it away.In this Book Ingrid continues the saga of the hate against Diana,and instead of writing about William and harry and how dreafull they have both come out,full of problems,while Diana is absent for 6 years and the boys were raised by Charles and Camilla,she again blames everything on Diana.She has become a joke to the world of journalists and her suck up to Charles and Camilla is disgusting,i recomend people to buy this book and burn it.Ingrid Seward to Ingrid Selling my own mother for a royal kissass Seward."
2,Wrong size (oz) advertisied,"Ordered the 3.3oz but received the 1 oz Seller claims it was a mistake on Amazon's part. Was offered a discount or return. Selected the return, but was sent a priorty ship label. USPS said they could not accept liquids w/priorty mailing. Had to pay to have the perfume sent back. Still waiting for reimbursement for shipping from seller. Have received refund for the item."
4,stacking leaves a lot to be desired,"I ordered 2 of them and got the supports to stack 2 on top of each other.Stacking is quick and easy...but not sturdy at all. One light hit and the supports shift and boxes become very unstable.the top tray literally just sits in the supports. There should be some sort of groove on the top and bottom for the supports to actually fit into.Update...ok...I increased this from 3 stars to 4 stars. IF you bend the supports and make them tighter, and stick them in the corners, then the stability is a LOT better. The top tray can still be removed easily...which isnt necessarily a bad thing."
1,not even the color pictured or matching one another,"I have always been happy with Amazon thus far... but I ordered 2 of these and they aren't even as deep or rich in color as the image shown and the 2 that I received are completely different in color from one another, one is really light in comparison to the other. You would think that they would at least send a matching set. Highly disappointed."
1,Stinks,"I love me some bath salts and will try anything that says ""stress relief"" but I thought these were stinky. After one bath I ended up giving the rest away. I suppose everyone likes different things and scent is such a personal thing, but I thought this was gross. I really liked the ""Detox"" one from this company though."
2,never again,really not a very effective substitute for foodsaver bags. 2ply vs. 3ply. I would never buy again.
1,Fits Tilia not made by Tilia,"These rolls caused more grief than they were worth. I wasted as much material as I used. These rolls are rolled the opposite way to a real Tilia roll with the smooth side up. They price point was appealing but was wasted on multiple attempts at bagging the same item. I have used a Tilia FoodSaver for 10 yrs. and never had this problem with their rolls. I started out with a model that used 8"" rolls and liked it so much that I purchased one that uses the 11"" roll. I also found that the best buy for Tilia FoodSaver rolls was from Sam's Club in a 6 roll configuration(4x11"" and 2x8"") for around $40.00.Thanks,JohnThunder Bay, OntarioCanada"
2,not the same as foodsaver,I'm not sure if I read the description carefully or if it was changed but I thought I was buying food saver bags. These are not the same quality as foodsaver bags buyer beware.
2,Vacuum Bag Rolls,Several of the rolls had folds in the plastic which made it difficult to impossible to make a good seal. A lot of the product was wasted.
1,BUYER BEWARE...,"My friend ordered the 8"" and 11"" bags thinking that they were made by Talia/Foodsaver. I was all set to do the same, when I read the negative reviews and the description of the product. It says "" FITS Tilia FoodSaver"" - not that it is made by Talia. Fortunately I didn't order these bag, and she is stuck with a poor product - what a rip off. Proves that you have to read everything. Amazon should correct this immediately so that no more unsuspecting customers will waste their $$. When it looks too good to be true - it probably is."
5,Skagen = Awesome,"This is my second Skagen, and just like the first one, this is a Fantastic Watch! Thin, Stylish, and Uber Cool!"
5,Great Looking Watch!,"I bought this as a gift. The recipient is very happy with the Skagen watch. I admit the price is incredible, but the looks are really sharp. A very stylish piece. Both of us are very pleased. You will not be disappointed."
2,breaks easily,It's great if your in the habit of buying a new watch every three months.It falls apart and breaks way too easily.
2,"Slim, comfortable, but too delicate","The watch was a favorite of mine for a number of years. Lightweight, adjustable and breathable wristband; very slim. BUT, after the battery was replaced, the seal failed and the watch died. I ordered a replacement through Amazon at a very low price. The crystal cracked when bumped. Same thing on the second replacement. Toughen the glass, please."
4,Nice product,Bought this as a gift and very happy with the product. Everyone who has seen this product was happy. Also arrived quite on time.
5,Good case cover.,"Nice price, good quality. My son likes it, as does his teacher. Can't say whether the slightly pricier one might have been worth the extra money."
3,You won't be using this one for years to come,"This is a nice, economical flute bag that serves its purpose very well. However, it started tearing up after about a year or so of use. My daughter does take it to school every day, but she is very careful with her belongings. If you have a child who is very rough with things, this case won't last that long. We will still probably buy another one just like it though. My daughter had a more expensive flute bag before this one, and it barely lasted a few months before it started tearing at the handle. I am afraid to shell out a lot of money for a really expensive bag and then it won't be any better than this one. At least we know what we're getting with this one, and it doesn't cost that much."
3,It's ok...,"This case offers you a place to keep your flute case, piccolo, and some extra stuff (slide grease, key oil, w/e). The one thing I don't like about this case is that the bluging exterior pocket makes it look freaking fat. You are no longer holding a slim flute case, some sort of luggage. Overall, the case is really convenient; I just seem to have issues with its appearance."
4,Great Chess Story,"Probably the only available good chess movie. (There are a bunch on other sports but not on chess)Worth watching if you like chess, atleast once."
3,Im a chessplayer..and this is what I think,"No one can play chess well without years of practice. The idea that a 10yr kid one days says I can play is unrealistic. Bobby Fischer used to study 18 hours a day for decades.The other part I thought was unrealistic, was the guys in Washington Square. That everyone in the park is a drug dealer or alcoholic or general bad influence. Thats total crap. Lots of guys in the park are bad, but the good players above 1800 arent. You cant play at 1800+ and be doing drugs or alcohol all the time. It requires a lot to get to 1800+. If you think it is easy to get to 1800+, by all means give it a whirl.I like chess because it is both science and art. Like the sweet science of boxing. Or japanese samurai sword fighting."
5,Stage Mother,"That phrase fits the Father in this true story. Here's an example:the now adult once came so close to being an Olympic star when younger,and is now trying to live their dream through their own child. They push and push. You don't have to know a thing about chess to enjoy this movie. You'll go through many facets of your emotions such as laughter,sadness,pity,joy,crying,etc. I recommend close-captioning as it starts out barely audible.Josh is a Grandmaster that has teamed up with computer programmers and has produced ""Chessmaster"" programs. They are affordable and are ready to insert into your CD/DVD drive. He teaches,with quizzes that will give you a USCF rating (equivalent). You can play against the computer,or pick out of 150 personalities also for a rating.Rubo"
5,It's about searching for the next Bobby Fischer.,"It's about a boy that was really good at chess but nobody knew.One day he and his mom were walking in the park. There were some guies there that charged five dollars for someone to play them. When he played the best guy there they knew that he had real talent so they started giving him lessons. When he got home he played with his dad. He held back from beating him at first but after a while he didn't mind so he beat him all the time.After his dad found out how good he was he got him an expert teacher. After he had been teaching him for a while and taught himwhat he needed to know, he entered many tournaments. He won them all until he went to the biggest tournament of them all. When he got to that tournament, he had to play a kid that he didn't think he could beat but he did."
2,This is so not what real competitive chess is about,Too much drama. I watched this movie and cringed at how they portrayed chess and chess players.
3,chess is just a game: more than that and you lose something,"With chess computers that can beat anybody with a database of all the best gamesever played and very deep look ahead ability, humans and chess seem a side issue.Autistic children are a plague of the modern generation:a mathematician who was trained from a very early age in proving and problem solvinggave up a fields medal.Teaching you children to be hawks or lions doesn't make themgood monkeys as this movie points out.But still it rewards the hawk over the lamb...The ethics of bringing up a child just for one gameor one narrow hope in life is probably wrong.Some people find themselves unable to bear losingor admitting they can make mistakes;that stops their learning process in a rut.I liked the movie: it was well acted and well writen."
5,the other reviewer missed the point,"The reviewer who gave the movie a 1 star missed the point. Josh Waitzkin wasn't peddled as the next Bobby Fischer by the filmmaker. In the movie, Josh repeatedly said ""but I'm not him"" after his teacher (played by Ben Kingsley) forced Josh to be like Fischer. The most important point was the emphasis on the huge difference between Waitzkin and Fischer. Waitzkin led a balanced life, while Fischer disappeared several times to hide from public view."
2,POOOOR Thai Version/Late delivery,"I have had many GREAT experiences with Amazon, but this has to be the WORST EVER. First took FOREVER, to get here, when it did, it was a version from THAILAND. What the heck!!! C'mon, if I wanted a bootleg version, I'd bought one off the street. will be reluctant to purchase anything ever."
3,"Not the Best, but ok",it is ok. It does leak steadily unless you have it so the opening is angled back a bit. I threaded the hook that it came with into the top of my plant hanger rather than sticking in the dirt to prevent leaking.
2,This is BAD,"This isn't even a music cd. It's one of those unauthorized interview cd's that give you a brief history of the struggles..blah,blah,blah. You are better off searching Ebay for their first two albums or taking your chances on downloading some of their older songs. Stay away from this one, unless you really want to hear about the struggles....."
3,Duh.,"For those of you who didn't realize: ""Maximum Evanecense: The Unauthorised Biography of Evanescence""Read the title and it shouldn't be a confusion.S."
1,Where does it say Autobiography in the title?,"This was a rip-off. Absolutely the worst buy ever made on Amazon.com. At the price I thought I was getting music. Forget that, there was none to hear."
4,A Fun Read,"This was a brilliant faery tale, told as one should be. The story is full of quests, meandering through woods and mountains, wizards gardens and terrifying castles. The characters are unexpected but so fitting for the story. What I love about this book is that the story is not as straightforward as you might think; just when you're sure the Quest is over, you realize there are 100 pages left to go and are constantly surprised by the authors ingenuity and yet the simplicity is stunning. Wonderful book, a must-read for those who love fantasy."
2,The cover art is its best feature,"And, to be honest, that's the reason I bought the book - I was bored and liked the cover. While it was better than reading cereal boxes, I couldn't help wondering if the author had simply written up a long-running (very, very long-running) D&D campaign."
1,1 star is more than it deserves.,"this book is terrible, i didn't get more than a few chapters into it! the writing stinks and the characters just don't cut it. this is a weak excuse for a story!"
5,The Unlikely Ones,"To be honest, I'm not a fan of fantasy novels. But I found this book at a flea market and was intrigued by the description on the back and the quote suggesting that even people who don't enjoy fantasy books would enjoy this one. It's true; every page of this book held my attention fast. The characterization is stellar, dialogue is smart and witty, and the story overall is sweet, original, not at all cliche. The seven main characters are so endearing; you can't help but wish them well and hope against hope for a happy ending. It's a tale of friendship and camaraderie, self-discovery and, most importantly, the nature of love in every possible incarnation. More than once I found myself moved to tears, and I highly recommend ""The Unlikely Ones"" to all readers~ but especially animal lovers.(Please ignore the new cover art.)"
5,A1 Cardone A1C58-Water Pump,"I find this product to be very good. I am using it right now on my Chevrolet 1997 Malibu, and it is working perfect."
5,Art of Life,"This is X-Japan's magnum opus. Yoshiki spent 4 years writing this song and it payed off. This is an amazing lyrical journey through yoshiki's inner soul.An amazing cd, 29 minutes of greatness!!!!"
5,No Words!,"An amazing project. This cd brings me back to the 80's and remind me of the Outfields. But this is the positive version. No more broken hearts. This CD is of victory and praise. The first song Treasure is a real treasure, Joy and incredible and unique style. Look What You've Done and great 80's style hard rock song with a powerful message. The rest of the songs, Sacrifice, Earnestly, Anthem, A Million Lights, 1*0*1, Can I See Your Face? and Worldwide are the perfect combination to make this whole CD a classic in Christian Music. Is joyful, victorious and full of faith. There are many great Christian Bands but this is one that concentrate to glorify God with joy and gratefulness. Amazing, awesome, 100% Joy."
1,Unable to hear IPOD,"When AC adapter is plugged into wall and attached to speakers, it picks up radio stations via satellite or something and when cord is attached to IPOD shuffle the sound from the radio station gets even louder. Unable to hear what is playing on the IPOD."
