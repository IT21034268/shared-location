5,Beautiful that is all I'm saying,"So far so good. Came super fast. The only thing complaint is they left it outside my front door so anyone could have grabbed it. But I hope it is as nice as the picture, its a present so I hope that the person I bought it for loves it, I will comment more once we put it together. But so far I am giving it a 5 star rating.."
4,"Pretty, perfect for small room. drawer dimensions below","My boyfriend bought this for me from Furnituremaxx using his Amazon account. After reading the reviews, I knew there was a good chance it would come damaged, but concidering the price, we decided to order it anyway. Upon arrival, everything was accounted for and the only damage it had was about an inch dent in the left hand corner of the table top. If I hadn't been expecting an issue like this, I would have been pretty upset, but I was prepared for this very problem after reading the reviews. The table and stool itself seem very sturdy (the stool is an ugly floral print, which I will reupholser myself to match my silver/black damask drapes).The drawer itself measures 12 7/8"" wide x 10 3/8"" deep x 1.75"" tall (I found it slightly aggravating that most vanities on here don't mention the storage room in the drawers, which, due to my vast MAC collection was very important)."
4,"Perfect size for a small room, but the finish does not hold up well.","I really do like this vanity, and it is really pretty and was just the right size for me (by the way it is very, very small, to those who want to know). However, it seems to be a little less than sturdy and after one week of light use, the finish had a ton of scratches. The varnish scratches so easily that I had to cover it with a lace runner. Those faults aside, I thought that for me this was perfect in size and and is very pleasing to the eye. I paid $83 for my vanity and I think even with the weak varnish that,for me, it was worth the buy. I do not recommend this for a child or for someone who is hard on furniture, because I don't think it could withstand such hard use."
3,Color is NOT what it is on the picture!!,"I received this set two days ago and was very disappointed to see that the color of this set is far from cherry finish. It is more like dark burgundy. It is not even close to what it's shown on the picture. The set is nice, but if I would have known of the color originally, I wouldn't have bought this vanity set it because it is a huge difference in color with my cherry bedroom set"
3,You get what you pay for...,I wasn't expecting the best vanity in the world for the price I paid but the bench broke within a week and had to have it fixed. The table is small and I have just enough space to keep my hair equipment and makeup bag on it with about 5 inches of space for brush/comb/clips. Next vanity I order will be sturdy and not so flimsy...
2,Beautiful Vanity Set -- but came broken,"The picture of the item I purchased was the wrong color -- it looked like a brighter orange-like color, but turned out to be a darker cherry color. Also, it seems during shipment that the mirror was shattered. I was unable to return just the mirror for a new one, so ended up returning all of it and finding a nice vanity set on craigslist for half the price!"
3,"Nice looking, but doesn't whistle or pour well","My wife was delighted with the appearance of this christmas gift. The color was just what I had in mind, and it goes well with the decor of our kitchen.Unfortunately, the beauty is only skin deep. When the water boils the kettle does not whistle unless you walk over to it and force the hot spring-loaded spout cover down upon the spout. Even then, the whistle would hardly get your attention from another room.Furthermore, when pouring water from the spout, the water dribbles down the fron of the kettle. Suggest you make another selection!"
2,Just for decoration,"I was pleased with the appearance of the teakettle; however the function leaves much to be desired. The whistle is like a very quiet, sick train and I have yet to pour without a spill. This thing leaks badly!"
3,Whistle little Tea Pot,"It whistles kinda. More of a low howl. I can live with that, the challenge of getting the water into a cup I don't like. It burbles and sputters water (hot) all over the counter, But it's pretty.."
1,Bad buy!,"This teakettle looks great, and I was thrilled when I first received it, but was quickly disillusioned. The sound. which supposedly would warn someone that the kettle was boiling, only worked for 2 days, now nothing happens. Also, the kettle also has a bad habit of boiling over without warning. If there is a way of returning it for credit, I sure would love to know about it."
5,Very cute umbrella for your little fire fighter,"Got this for our 4 year old who wants to be a fireman like his dad; seems to be good quality, fairly thick material like the average adult umbrella. Not sure that it would hold up to strong winds, but fine for an average rainy day. Also nice that it has reflective stripe on it--may come in handy for a drizzly Halloween night since we'll have a ""fireman"" costume for Halloween again this year!"
1,Worst so-called jazz video ever,"As the other reviewer said, this is an amateur production. The narrator is dull, uninformed, and provides little insight or information. This is really an audio production with many (repeated often) still photos of the great musicians. What video there is has nothing to do with the musician(s) featured. The audio features a lot of great music, although never complete pieces. The DVD is broken into sections but the meaning of each is never revealed. We even get to see a couple of videos of Nazi activity in WWII but that is not tied into the purpose of the DVD. Avoid this at any cost."
2,Lindbergh Kidnapping Case (VHS),The tape was defective. The Seller did not have a way to tell if it was because it was in the original container. I have had an excellent response from the Seller in returning the tape.
4,Eye Opener,"A love triangle's gone deadly wrong and Mane Jackson is in the middle of the situation. The cops that are working the homicides are looking his way, attempting to figure out where he becomes a part of the situation.The book itself was a great read. It keeps you on your toes attempting to piece together the murders and the story plot itself. My favorite part of the book is when Mane discovers who the killer is because it is truly a shock even to the reader."
3,A Murderer Among Us,"Two women, two friends, two college students are brutally murdered. Clearly from the way they were butchered, the killer had a problem with them. The one thing connecting the two - Mane Jackson, All-American running back and Heisman trophy contender. One was his woman. One was his lover. Was that reason enough for them to die? Mane insists that he didn't do it, but if he didn't, then who?Changing Faces, Changing Places is a fast paced erotic thriller. Maybe I've watched one too many episodes of Law & Order and Forensic Files, but I figured out whom the murderer was in the very (and I do mean very) beginning of the book, which took away all the suspense and fun for me. It was by no means a bad read, just predictable. I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more had I not played Kojak. Also, the editing was NOT great. This was my first read by Ms. Molare and I believe I'll read another of her novels."
4,I like it,this is a cute mirror it is smaller that I expected but it's very clear and can see all of my pores.
3,"The ""Radiance"" is Self-Tanner","I suppose I didn't read the description thoroughly. The Quench Body Lotion contains some self-tanner, with that unpleasant self-tanner smell (if you've ever used one you know what I'm talking about!) It did the job, however, making my legs a little less pasty-white prior to a trip out to Palm Springs where my legs were certainly going to be bare. I like the Face lotion and would purchase it again. The Bonus Eye Pillow is pretty - cottony on one side and silky on the other. It's impregnated with a vaguely lavendar-ish scent."
1,Very disappointed.,"The bottle of perfume looks absolutely NOTHING like this cute pink bottle with the crown topper. Neither does the box it came in for that matter. The box we received it blue, no picture of Cinderella on it. The bottle is clear with a very plain clear top. Very disappointed."
4,Good for kids,My daughter loved the fragrance. It's a sweet fruity smell. Please note that this is by no means a famous designer perfume.
4,what a pity...,"I would love to be able to own or even hear this version of The Ring, but at over $200 for the set, I'm afraid it's too expensive for me. Consequently, I must deduct one star and award it only four. Pity."
3,Exepcted more from Cuisinart,"We've owned this toaster oven for about 2 years now, and got it as a gift to replace another one. After about a year the door broke on it, so we couldn't close the door all the way. Not TOO big of a deal, we still used the oven. The crumb tray is easy to remove and clean, and the whole oven in general is nice-looking. I wish it had a timer function when baking--it seems silly to me to set the oven to cook, and then have to set a timer on another appliance. It cooked great, although food got more ""toasty"" on the top than on the bottom.Last week the oven died. I expected longer-lasting performance from Cuisinart, but maybe two years is the standard life-span of a toaster oven."
4,Cuisinart Toaster Oven,This Toaster Oven replaces an old one. It exceeds the other in every way except it takes quite a long time to toast!
4,"Cuisinart TOB-50W Classic Toaster Oven Broiler, White and Stainless","It does a nice job toasting. For broiling, I find it takes longer than my old toaster oven, esp. when using frozen food, and doesn't brown too well.I also find it odd that one is supposed to keep the oven open when broiling. It seems awfully wasteful. I haven't used it for baking."
4,"Very nice, almost perfect actually","The range is great, i tested it with a Motorola V3 and was able to get as much as sixty feet from the phone and not hear a bit of static. The volume controls are nice, and you can even voice dial through it.Unfortunately, it was very uncomfortable on my ear, and the volume controls are a touch small. Try a dummy unit on before buying it."
4,beautifully crafted vanity table,"This vanity table is beautifully crafted and just as pretty as the picture shows it. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, is because I think the fabric on the chair is a little out-dated. Nothing a simple recover can't fix."
3,nickel bronze finish metal vanity table stool and mirror set,"the product was great, but i had a little trouble recieving this product...not sure what happened the first time but was told that the only way i would get it the second time if i took my first review off...i didn't know that companies used black mail to get good reviews....the second delievery went well and had no problems with it....my only complaint is the way they handled the first time that it didn't go out for some reason instead of just saying there was a mistake they tried to cover it up...this is the holidays and i understand that mistakes happen just need to handle them better."
1,ESTATE OF BILL EVANS - Unauthorized Biography,"As far as the estate can tell, at this time, this appears to be an unauthorized biography. The Estate of Bill Evans does not claim any responsiblity to it's contents or the quality of it's conjecture.Buy at your own risk.Bill Evans Estate..."
2,Musical Biography?? In what way?,"I also prefer How My Heart Sings over this one -I'm a huge Evans fan and as a jazz musician, I was thrilled about finding a ""musical biography"". Well, just repeating the same old stories as all the other books on the subject and then throwing in comments about the recordings -some of them suspiciously harsh, even- does not make it any more musical than any other biography. Not only that, but the times he comments on the actual music, he is almost invariably mistaken and wrong; ""Freddie Freeloader"" in NOT in a minor key and ""These Things Called Changes"" is based on ""What Is This Thing Called Love"", not ""All The Things You Are"" as Shadwick suggests. If he ever really studied the Manne-Hole live recordings instead of undeservedly dismissing them, he would know that Evans was already using the very same changes. As a collector of everything about Mr.Evans, I had to get this but I would not recommend it to anyone. Two stars for the subject alone."
2,"""How My Heart Sings"" vastly superior","If you want an excellent biography on Bill Evans, pick up a copy of ""How My Heart Sings"". This book pales in comparison, but it is not without its merits. It has excellent photographs and is well-organized. The analysis of the music is rather subjective and unclear. The writing style is dry and does not flow well. Others have found several factual errors. If you're interested in good pictures and a rough overview of Evans, ""Everything Happens to Me"" is worth picking up."
2,Frustrating...,"The problem with this book is that one example relies on examples from another chapter. Therefore, you have to pretty much read the entire 900 pages to get an example in the latter chapters to operate properly.An additional problem is the reference to downloading classes on websites that no longer exist.If you already know XML parsing, then this book is fine, but then I guess you wouldn't need the book."
5,The Best Book on PHP ever,"As a beginner to PHP and XML i was a bit hesistant topick up this book, but as i flipped through the first few chapters in a book store i was sure this was the book for me.I have read this giant of a book from cover to cover and i am well on my way to practically implementing the concepts i picked up (esp. in the XML RPC chapter and example) at work here.Here is a breakdown of who should read what:*Beginner to PHP and XML: Cover to Cover;)*Beginner to PHP, Proficient in XML : Again Cover to Cover;)*Proficient in PHP, Proficient in XML : Can afford to skip first few chaptersNo doubt this is the best book i have read. Kudos to all involved."
2,not my style,"I purchased jennifer nichole lee's Fabulously fit moms, and i loved it. i thought it was easy to follow and not too complicated but at the same time, it gave you real good workout. I was disappointed when i tried doing this workout. Really not my style. For those of you that like working upper body You might like it. I enjoy mostly cardiac aerobics and lower body workouts."
3,they didn't last 8 hours,they were ok for the price but didn't last... i liked the flexible flame ... but nothing exceptionalhowever i would purchase again
3,Tealight candles Flameless,its great idea its much better than buying a ton on candles but would recommend that the company brighten the light a little bit more. Its pretty dim unless its totally dark.
3,OK after initial challenges,"These lights shipped quickly but the envelope and thin cardboard box they shipped in were damaged in the mail. Some of the lights did not work at first, but by re-seating the battery and bending the contacts I got all of them functioning. The power switch on the bottom is easy to operate and they fit in the glass sleeves I needed to fill. They look like plain white candles and give off the same amount of light."
3,battery operated tealight candle set,"I have only tried 3 candles in this set. One candle had a very realistic ""flame"" color while the other 2 had a greenish color flame. I was disappointed because I wanted all of them to be realistic."
3,"Okay, but an odd size","I ordered these candles to go in votive holders for centerpieces for my wedding. But when I popped these candles in the holders I found that the ""flame"" part of the candle peaked out of the top of the holder! These candles are larger than the ones that can be bought in retail stores. I actually returned these particular candles to purchase the ones in the store, and they fit fine.Other than the odd size these candles are pretty good. The ""flame"" is a nice amber color and the soft flickering imitates an actual candle very well!"
1,Do not buy these cheap tea candles,Do not but these cheap candles.The photo makes them look so elegant.There are a cheap white plastic with acrummy battery they faded after about 24 hours.Do not waste your money.
3,battery operated LED tealights,"When I received the product, it wasn't what I imagined. When I contacted them, they refunded my payment immediately. They are great to work with. I would recommend this company!"
1,Fake Looking,I bought these thinking they would have a realistic look. They are completely a waste of money. It looks like a piece of plastic with a light sticking out the top of it. I want my money back.
1,"I can't stand this kind of ""Bait & Switch""","After finding these candles, I added them to my cart and standard shipping was $11.15. What an incredible rip-off. I do not do business with people like this."
4,Totally worth it!,"These tealights are great in places that real tealights would cause danger. Great flicker, but best if used in frosted or colored votive holders, not tall, and not clear, as the only issue that I find a problem is the appearance of the ""flame""--if you hide this behind something with color, it's great. Great for windows sills where real flames could meet the curtains (ouch) ..but another great use is bookshelves where soot from real candles would discolor both books and shelves. Would order these again in a heartbeat!"
3,Dim light,"I like the concept of these candles. However, I have found that the lights appear very dim if they are set in colored glass votives. I can barely tell they are turned on, at times."
3,FLICKERING BATTERY-OPERATED TEALIGHT CANDLES,"THESE LIGHTS/CANDLES WORK JUST FINE. HOWEVER, MY PREFERENCE IS THE COLORED ONES. THEY'RE GREAT FOR POWER OUTAGES, KIDS OR ""MOOD"" LIGHTING. THEY DO FLICKER JUST LIKE A REAL CANDLE IN A LIGHT BREEZE."
5,"Lasts forever- well, not quite but almost!","I can't believe how long these candles last. I bought them for my wedding which hasn't come yet- but I tested one candle and it ""burned"" for days. I was very impressed with how it looked in the frosted votive I bought- it totally looks like a real candle. Great product."
3,Not impressed...,I'm not at all impressed with these. They are a bit larger than the ones from the dollar store so take note on the measurements before you buy. Also I think they look fake and they don't flicker very much at all. In fact it looks like a steady burning light. Oh well for the price they do work ok.
4,Work Well,I like these fameless candles and they seem to work great. I ordered one box and liked how they looked and ended up ordering another box. So far so good.
2,Will Be Replacing These with Something Else,"Some of the lights didn't work right out of the box. One of them had the whole battery compartment missing. And one of them was a GREEN light.However, the two biggest problems are the color and the dimness. These lights are VERY YELLOW. I got them to use in several stained glass candle lanterns and votive holders. My purple glass lamp looks brown with this light. My red lamp looks orange. Blue looks dull teal. They do not give off a candle-flame color at all. Second, they are very, very dim. They barely shine through the glass at all. I will be trying a different product to replace these."
2,Not the greatest,We were looking for a flameless candle for our wedding reception. These candles were a bit dim and flickered too much to look similar to a real candle.
2,Disappointed,"I desperately wanted my daughter to enjoy a yummy chocolate chip cookie. She is allergic to nuts and eggs, among other things. We eat pretty healthy and I kept an open mind, but these were just gross. My 22 month old wouldn't take more than 1 bite. My husband and I couldn't even eat more than one. :("
5,These cookies rock!,"I just made these cookies for my son, who cannot have dairy and they are amazing! I was skeptical at first of how they would taste, but once I tasted one, all my fears/worries washed away :) They are delicious! My son(2) likes them so much that he is actually crying that he can't have more :)"
5,Terrific CD.....,"If you are an Irish Rovers fan then this is a ""must have"" CD. If you are a Bodhran player or learning to play one, this has some of the best Bodhran instrumental passages I have ever heard. They aren't solos but with the volume up a little the drum comes through very clearly. Most of the songs were either written by George Millar or were arranged by him. This CD really illustrates the individual and combined talents of this wonderful group. After 40 years they are better than ever! After your first listen to the songs on this CD, if you aren't singing them around the house or in your car then there is something wrong with you. Each song is done in signature Irish Rovers style with at least one passage done a cappella. One of my favorites is ""Down By The Lagan Side"" by Tommy Sands. I have almost worn this CD out I play it so much. I highly recommend this CD."
4,Irish at its best!,When I listened to this CD I was intrigued! Its so enchanting and fascinating and great for any Irish music lover!
4,Too bad they broke up.,"A unique band that mixes some quirky music and lyrics. Its a fun album to listen to, but don't get too attached. Totally worth the few dollars it cost to get the cd."
4,Where is peeping Tommy?,"Great band!!! Love the ecletic sound they have, and the CD is a great addition to my collection!!!"
3,For being just a hood...,"...it does its job. I'm using the ET-67B with the Canon EF-S 60mm macro lens.pros- sturdy- finish matches Canon SLR body- lower costcons- the fit isn't very snug, it jiggles a wee bit"
5,It's a lens hood....,"It's a lens hood. Not much to say. Cheap price, well built, and it fits the lens. I guess that does it."
3,Too bulky,"As a lens hood it does it's primary job very well - to protect the lens and keep stray light away. But I feel it is too tight on my lens ((EF 70-300 4-5.6 IS USM) and bulky. I like the flower design of my Canon EW-78BII for my EF 28-135 IS USM lens. It fits perfect and look more decent than this bulky hood. It even has the red markers on the hood to align with the red dot on the lens for locking and unlocking, so that you can attach or detach the hood quickly (similar to attaching the lens to the camera body). I guess the original Canon ET-65B design is also bulky. So I can't blame this hood, but a given a second chance I would have bought the hood in flower shape which looks more decent and little smaller in size. The price also seem to be $5 or $6 cheap. I am not sure how they perform though."
4,Non Canon Lens Hood,For the price this was a good option. A little difficult to get it on correctly at first and so it feels secure. I would recommend it for someone trying to save a few dollars over the much more expensive brand names.
3,Fits Perfectly,"It fits perfectly on my EF-S 70-300mm lens. Three stars because it costs too much for just some thin plastic that so far for me has resulted in some negligible results, both indoors and outdoors."
5,Battle between good and evil.,"A man born in a luxury brothel is asked by his mother, a madam, to search for his father. During the search he meets two women : the unselfish Ilhaam and the provocative Kariema, who is married to a much older man. The man is torn between the two: Ilhaam, a reflection of his father - a promise and a dream difficult to become true- and Kariema, a reflection of his mother - sensual pleasure and criminal practices. Kariema asks him to kill her husband and to marry her. In the meantime the search for his father continues.A thrilling story, sensually written."
3,"great band, decent re-release..dont throw out collection of pop classics just yet","one question? where is Degenerated?!? that is one of the best Reagan youth songs and it is, for some unknown reason, left out of this release. im usually a sucker for this re-mastered/re-released stuff, but this one regresses by leaving off one of the best songs by them...and JUST that song!...and it's a shame because the sound is nice and remastered and this would have been a superb upgrade to the low sound level ""collection of pop classics"", but the exclusion of that single song makes the compilation an ""ill pass"" type of releasegreat otherwise, just dont believe the track listing, degenerated isnt there."
5,One of the best,Simple yes... but this was the book that launched my career and a lifetime of helping others... it's simple and straightforward... LOVE IT!!!!!!
1,Broke within minutes of opening package,"Received on Christmas morning, open blister pack, attach small camera and try to adjust. The part that holds the camera broke off from the legs. Waste of money since I'll have to pay for shipping, and they recommend insurance, to get it repaired/replaced."
1,Broke within 30 seconds,The tripod broke as soon as I tightened the nut. I hadn't even tightened it enough to hold it in one place.(See further comment). I upgrade this to 4 stars.
5,Good use of Native Species,"I'm not under 13, but I didn't want to give my name and email.This book is great. It takes advantage of some great underused native plants from the Mid Atlantic. It is very helpful because it provides plant spacing and maintenance. Most plants are low maintenance, all year interest.I have used the landscape plans in my yard and will continue to use this book as my number one reference."
3,Blue's Clue Video,Plastic on video was broken. It still plays but I have to be careful with it. Kind of a pain.
2,Not What I Expected,"After hearing Fairouz's evocative voice from other albums, I was thrilled to find this in my local record store. But I was very disappointed. Instead of Middle Eastern music, it sounds more like Edith Piaf. If you are a big Fairuz fan, this might be to your liking, but if you're seeking more traditional Middle Eastern music, look elsewhere. I wish there had been some indication of the musical style on the package."
3,Needs to be sturdier,Tool works fair but when closing tool on an arrow you may get a lot of side to side movement which will smear glue all over arrow shaft.
5,Right on the money!,"My son is autistic. I appreciate how Mr. Littman showed the special qualities and talents of the autistic boy in this book. The story was full of interesting characters, too, so even if you do not have an autistic child in your family, you will enjoy this book."
3,Great guide.,"Wonderful trainer and reference for calligraphy; however, I wish it had even more detail and tips for flourishes to further enhance my writing. Excellent book. Highly Reccomended if wanting to learn or refresh you calligraphy skills."
3,Metabo KGS 303,"The KGS 303 Saw, while very functional, does not have the useability features that many of the other saws do. The miter/bevel guages are relatively small and hard to read. The standard stops on the miter/bevel are useable, but don't inspire confidence in their lasting durability. The D-handle is very nice, and the blade guard functions well. The soft start is nice, but the electric brake takes its time slowing the blade. In all, it seems like a very good homeowners saw at a contractors price."
4,"FUN,FUN,FUN","THIS IS MY FIRST TIME FOR BUYING POLLY POCKET. MY DAUGHTER,AGE5, ABSOLUTLEY LOVES IT. IT HAS MADE HER POLLY POCKET SO HIP CRUISE SHIP EVEN BETTER TO PLAY WITH. THE AMOUNT OF CLOTHES IS GREAT, PLUS IT COMES INSIDE OF A CASE THAT CAN BE USED AS STORAGE. I WILL DEFINITELY BUY MORE POLLY POCKET TOYS. PLUS THE TOYS ARE PERFECT FOR LITTLE FINGERS."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this watch b/c my husband loves to run and wanted a way to track his distance when taking new routes. Unfortunately, within 3 weeks of receiving the watch the buttons on the sides stopped working. Basically, the only feature that still worked was telling time. Assuming we just got a flawed product, we asked Amazon to send a replacement. Well, we've had the new watch for about a week and the wrist band is already starting to come off. It is just cheaply made!"
3,Unable to switch between chronometer and Pedometer,"This is a reasonable product. However, I find that if you put the watch in the Pedometer mode, you will not be able to switch it to the chronometer mode. This I think is important for people who run to time and wants to know how much they have covered in that duration."
3,Not so accurate,My husband and I run 5k and 10k races and realized this watch is a little tricky to set. It is never consistent or accurate. It was off by over a mile on his last race. Everything else has worked fine.
4,Very Happy with this watch,I really feel this is a quality product. I like almost everything. I have found the Pedometer to be very effective. Slight drawbacks only include the complexity of setup regarding the pedometer. It took me a few patient moments to understand what I needed to do. I went to a local track and counted my steps over 100 meters already marked on the track. Other aspect that I find kind of odd is the dual time. I wish you could toggle between which time was more prominent. But that is just a style issue. I would absolutely buy this watch again. - F
2,Inaccurate data,"I bought this product for tracking running distance and averages.The watch is easy to operate with o.k. instructions, however the data is most inaccurate. The distance shows always more than it actually was. (I have verified it via car and bike.) I basically use it as watch and chronometer now."
5,Best running watch I own.,"I own several types of running watches, GPS and otherwise, and this is the easiest and most useful tool I've found. Works best if you take the time to figure out your pace on a track."
1,poorly made,"First off, the wrist band broke within 2 weeks, but worse was the fact that if you pushed the wrong button sequence before starting a run, it becomes usless. I run 5+ m every day and followed the directions exactly to start the timer in run mode, but 7 days out of the first ten, when I finished my run, there was nothing there...no time, mileage, step count...nothing."
1,Cheap Band.,I liked the watch but the rubber in the band started to fall apart and Tech4o says that they don't have replacement bands.
5,Fantastic,"The first time I read this book, I cried at the end! I dont normally cry reading a book, but this was a really great story. I recommend it and all the other ones in the Bethlehem series!"
5,I wasn't disappointed,"I had read Pappano's work, Enchanted Season first, so I knew a little of the outcome of the book. Even knowing the end result, the book was a wonderful story and kept my interest all night. I couldn't put it down. Very lovable characters...I wish I could live in Bethlehem!"
3,"Bad, BAD Last Line....","Although I thought both this book and the first one, Retribution, were very well-written and suspenseful, the very last line in this book left me extremely disappointed and NOT looking forward to a third book.==SPOILER=== Hoffman should absolutely not ended the book with the 'new trial' line, but with an execution, and then moved her two primary characters off to a new plotline in a new locale. I so would not want to read and endure another Bantling scenario regardless of its conclusion: that conclusion should have come HERE and not in the manner it was.I would have given the book 4 stars if this had not been the case."
2,The Last Witness,"Since I had read ""Retribution"", I looked forward to this second book. They weren't among my favorites, as each book sort of leaves you hanging. I like books that end, even if the characters carry on in subsequent books. In fact I enjoy the ""folks"" that carry on, however, I think the story should complete."
2,Big OK,"I see that she will be back for a third installment based on the ending of this book. Ms. Hoffman, please make a concerted effort to NOT retell the first two books in the third book. I absolutely enjoyed the first, but I did not need to read it again in the second one. That, in and of itself, is my biggest complaint. At least HALF of ""Last Witness"" summarizes ""Retribution"". It took me forever to read this book because I was so bored. I read the first one, practically straight through, in an afternoon."
4,Picture and Tittle don't match.,"In the picture, it says it's princess Jasmine. But in the tittle, it says Belle. Which one is it exactly, Belle or Jasmine. It doesn't make one bit of sense. Please fix!"
3,Disappointed book reader - but the movie IS quite good,"Loved the book, and have read it more than once. This is a good production, but it's one of those that can't match the raw emotions and plots of the book.The best comparison I can give is 'Gone with the Wind'. If you read the book before seeing the movie, the movie was a disappointment. But, if you saw the movie and then read the book, you'd think both the movie and the book were fabulous.Same situation here."
2,The book is MUCH better,"I thought I'd give this a try because I enjoyed the book so much, but there were too many shortcuts. Follet's story uncovers the mysteries behind the plot with subtlety. This version hits you over the head with a linear, literal storyline. I was bored in 30 minutes. Not worth the price."
5,great movie,another great movie .. no wonder it was banned.. if your Catholic you may not wantto watch this.. what power the church had back then..
2,anti-Catholic as usual,"Excellent production values and acting, do not know the book so cannot compare; but as usual, in this PC world, using the Church as the monster is to be expected. And as a Catholic it offends me, as history is more complex than this simple black and white good and evil portrayal. The film ignores what the Church did in preserving learning, culture, in educating men on how to rotate crops, drain swamps, etc... how the church helped protect ordinary people from excesses of the royalty. The bias in this DVD sours me on it unfortunately. Ian McShane all in black as the evil one; the figures are too obviously stereotypical---But if you dont mind historical movies only loosely based on truth, then you may enjoy this."
4,Great movie.,Christian Slater back when he was first starting. It is an incredible movie about a lonely teen who tries to connect with others through his ham radio.
3,OK purchase,"The movie is as good as I remember. However, the volume went up and way down, the package was not sealed and it was supposed to be a ""new"" product. This experience was only OK."
2,"Short video, very few moves taught","I bought the video to learn more moves, but it has a very short instruction section. It has a warm up, a section with a couple moves taught and a workout section. I wasn't looking for a regular workout, I wanted a workout on the pole by learning more moves and techniques."
5,Love it,Great for beginners.....and received it promptly!!!Enjoy the video.....great beginner video...for people new to pole dancingand pole dance fitness. was great working with this buyer
1,It was Boring,"I was so bored watching this. I'm sure if it had been a little more interesting, I may have been able to learn something. I tuned out and just turned it off."
2,Not a great DVD,"I was disappointed with this DVD. According to the description I was expecting more from it. I bought other pole fitness DVD's for around the same price and was extremely happy with those. This is a joke, especially when there are 5 or more girls doing pole dance at once, you have no idea who to watch. I was expecting step by step instructions, not an exhibition."
5,Duplicates,"This CD, ""Tibetan Mysteries,"" by the Monks of the Dip Tse Chok Ling Monastery, SOW 90182, is apparently the same as volume 1 of ""Sacred Ceremonies,"" Fortuna 17074-2, distributed by Celstial Harmonies."
3,A very Convuluted Tale.,"I found this book extremely confusing. The story is quite convuluted, and there are a lot of characters to keep straight. I did not enjoy this one as much as the other Dolly books. In this book Johnston seems to be somewhat of a caricature of himself. He makes a lot more mistakes than he has in other books. The bird, Wendy, is not as likeable as the other birds either, and I never did ""get"" her mother. The action takes place is Morocco, and that was interesting. There is a lot about big business takeovers and shenanigans. We see motorcycle, horse and car chases. There is no lack of venues or excitement, but still a difficult book to get through. I'm sorry this is the last book in the JJ series, because I never will now get to his secrets."
5,Precious is right....,"Precious Little is simply a wonderful blues album. The slide guitar work on it is amazing and Jeremy Spencer's voice has held up remarkably well. After all these years, Spencer seems inspired again. I hope this album is a taste of more good things to come."
4,A book for all levels,"I have been in the food service industry for 18 years, and am always looking for new ideas. A friend told me about this book a month ago and I've been having fun with it ever since. There are so many original designs and instructions on how to create them. And many are easy enough for my kids to do."
1,Poor quality!!!!,"Do not buy this book!!! 10 minutes after I recieved the book, I decided to return it. The pictures of the sculpters are a poor quality, and some are not pictures at all, but are hand drawn illustraions (not good illustraions either). Even the sculptures themselves are tacky (littlerabbits with pink ears and so forth). Again...Please do not waste your money on this book."
4,Food Carving,Great book to inspire your creativity in food garnishing. It has some great pictures. Offer several tricks of the trade. Hard to follow on some techniques. It's like a homemade book send to a publisher to have it published.
4,Good value...,"Aeris XR-1 Wrist Computer ~Includes now FREE the Digital online class to get the most out of your dive computer.I use it only for repeated dives along with a Tusa 3 gauge compact console. The one button operation is not my preference and using it was a learning curve but in this price range I can't ask for more. Reading the screen in low light is a bit difficult (no back light, probably for battery saving reason). Runs on cheap, easy to find batteries and battery change is a breeze. This is a most affordable, reliable, basic model you can find. Excellent computer for the beginner or advanced diver as long as you use only air. Next time I'll go for a Nitrox model. I'd recommend it to a friend."
5,Perfect for the price,"This is a very basic dive computer that works great. Does everything that you need a basic dive computer to do. I used it on 8 dives and it performed flawlessly. It is not fancy, it does not have alot (or any) bells and whistles, but for the money, it is the best value around. The water activation featured worked perfectly. I love the one button operation, and the instructions were very clear and concise."
3,Better read before buying... or not.,"First off, I love the Flaming Lips. I collect most Flaming Lips gear I can get regardless. So no doubt this would be a fantastic DVD to own. And if I could watch it, I'm sure I'd love it haha.I didn't see this posted anywhere on the review when I bought it and it may have helped a bit. This disc is apparently meant for Region:*23456. I'm not sure what that means but seeing as it doesn't play on any DVD playing device I own I'll assume I'm not in that region (U.S) haha. Cool artwork though. Bought it for 1 cent so I'm not to heartbroken about it."
3,Need ice!,Pretty useful but the installation is a little convoluted and the big beefy hing that I liked so well hold on to heat like no other. I have actually burned the crud out of my arm on it. Sothwesterners beware!
1,Junk,Cheaply made. Does NOT conform to the seat or even close! Unable to secure it to seat. Forget about trying to write on that note pad lid.
2,unhappy buyer,lid broke off on the first day of use. poorly made. people work hard for their money. please do not sell merchandise no matter the cost with such poor workmanship.
4,Great for work,This is a high quality console for my work truck. It is a good size for my Ford F-450 cab. Nice height for an arm rest too.
3,Product arrived damaged,"I am not going to return it because it is still good enough for my work truck. I guess Amazon is mostly to blame - there was a small tear in the vinyl and the plastic insert was cracked. I am still happy with the product because I needed it, but it should have arrived in perfect condition. It's just not worth it for me to return it."
2,"length of console ohh, duhhh","I should of known better that some of amazons article details need to be carefully checked out as to this more carefully. With the Rampage 39423 Charcoal Contractor Console I had assumed that when it said it was 18 inches in length that it might fit my Nissan Frontier standard cab. Well it didn't. Also, when I pulled the drink holder out to see why the lid support was so loose I found that the piece wasn't attached to the body of it. But why would I examine something that doesn't fit? I was also checking to see if it would fit with some modification, i.e. without the drink holder. I'm not sure I can remodel it to my satisfaction but I like the concept well enough to try."
3,Reviewer Below,"""By contrast, England is part of the G-7, one of the richest countries in the world, and, still, needed all the help it could get from the United States in 1982 to defeat a third world country such as Argentina, in a fourth-class war against a fifth-class army.""The USA took a neutral position during the British, Argentinian conflict over the Falkland Islands. The reviewer below is incorrect when he states Great Britain (not just England) recieved help from the USA during this war.It goes to show, maybe that he should read more of the ""boring"" factual books that adorn his bookshelf rather than the glossy mags with pictures he might otherwise enjoy."
1,Toddler overalls - a waste of my money,"I bought a pair of overalls for my toddler grandson. The tab/button at the shoulder, fell off. He wore them 2 times, and then the buttom/tab came out of the fabric. A big waste of money."
2,Poor Quality,"The denim version of the overalls seems durable enough; however the corduroy overalls fell apart at the seams with the first washing/wearing. First a hole at the side, then a rip down the entire pant leg."
1,Do not buy this book,"Full of errors, buggy code, poor object design, and a real lack of study make this one of the most hated books in my library. Mark Watson and his publisher should be ashamed."
5,Awesome and simple!,"After reading the other reviews, I realized that this invested would be a great one, and it is TRUE!Easy to hook up (red, white, yellow cables - your own) from VCR out to Canopus device.Firewire to firewire.As a Mac use, I used iMovie to import movie - you won't hear the audio on import, but will on playback and editing.SUPER!"
4,Good quality; more work than Elgato device,"I tried this and theElgato Video Capture Device. I decided this won out, as I can squeeze a higher-quality video out of it. But the workflow is definitely more complex and time consuming, especially if you goal is mainly to capture of bunch of video and not edit everything. See my July 13, 2011 review of the ElGato, which compares to two devices and workflows."
5,Excellent Capture Device,"This device is a very good non-professional capture device. It seems a bit pricey but it is definately worth it. There are several reasons to like it. It is compatable with whatever operating system you have. This is because it does not require you to use their software and drivers. None are included, but don't worry. All operating systems have some kind of capture software bundled with them. I use cyberlink Power Director. Another reason to like it is you do not need a external power device. THIS ONLY APPLIES IF YOU HAVE A 6 PIN FIREWIRE (1394) PORT ON YOUR COMPUTER. If you have a 4 pin firewire port, you will need a 4 pin to 6 pin cable. If you have no port firewire port whatsoever, you cannot use this device. Also, it is a high quality device. The quality hardware is the reason this device is so expensive. Don't waste any money with cheaper devices. If you do, you will end up throwing the cheap one away. The cheap ones rarely work right. Three cheers for Canopus!!!"
5,Brilliant peripheral for new Macs,"I bought this with the intent to use it to encode old VHS so I could render them to DVDs and thus preserve old home movies. It does so with great ease - no power required if you use a six pin USB cable, and there is absolutely no user input required. Just plug your VCR or camcorder in on one side, and the firewire out the other side into the Mac, and off you go.Being a hardware encoder, I simultaneously ingested video while watching a DVD that I had just burned on the Mac, and the Mac didn't even twitch.The quality is fantastic - looks better than the original VHS. Also, with iMovie you can edit out all the nonsense that you would end up with if you took an old VHS to a photo or video store to render it. They're not doing any editing for you for the $30 or so most of them charge."
2,Do not buy it! Casio has very poor customer service history.,"Do not buy it! Casio has very poor customer service history! This watch rarely shows the right date and if you wanted to send it back to Casio for repair you have to pay to mail it to them, even when it's new. Look at complaints about Casio on the web. Go for Atomic if you really want a Casio..."
5,tpro,"I got this watch about a year ago. In the past year I have put this watch through its passes. I took it diving, through military exercises, and every day life. This watch has done extremely well! I would recommend this watch to every military person and anyone who is rough on watches."
3,Solar battery blows,"All is good w/ this watch, especially the multi-alarms on it. HOWEVER, if you dont expose this watch to sun light the BATTERY dies out until you give it sun. Actually it still works, but you have to hit a button to bring up the screen. So that got annoying and i've switched to another watch"
4,"Classic Sellers & Milligan, but video quality not very good","A classic piece of ""Goon Show""-style insanity. Especially interesting because the bumbling detective played by Sellers seems a clear forerunner to Inspector Clouseau, down to the trench coat and hat (though without the French accent here). Also watch for (or rather listen for) what I'm pretty sure is Sellers doing the narration in the beginning in a very funny American accent.One warning - the video quality is not very good, which I don't think is the fault of the transfer but probably the state of the original film by the time it was put on tape. Bright areas in particular seem to be often washed out in white. Not too much of a problem, really, though there is one scene where Sellers' character is communicating with a silent film actor by writing on a piece of paper and holding it up and it's very hard to make out what he's written."
2,Disappointed,"I have to agree with the reviewer named jrubi02 on this novel. I too am a fan of historical mysteries, and this work, while not without promise, was disappointing. As the other reviewer noted, the catapulting of the main character from a rural servant to being at the center of Tudor intrigue in no time is just too hard to believe. I couldn't get past that basic premise. Additionally, the brazen attitude the main character uses to win the confidence of both future Tudor queens is hackneyed, as is the romantic plot thread.The author does a nice job of portraying the historical period and is apparently learned in the history of the time. Morevoer, his enthusiasm for his subject is obvious. However, as much as I enjoy the historical characters portrayed in the book, I lost patience with it and didn't finish it. I know the author frequents these Amazon pages, and I hope he will take my critique in the spirit in which it is offered."
2,Mistakes,"In the beginning of the book, there is a reference to Elizabeth being Edward's ""younger"" sister. Blatantly inaccurate. I understand this is a work of fiction, but still, that's a very significant historical fact that the author changed. Plus, it served no purpose. (If he wasn't taking artistic license and that reference is just a mistake, then the editors certainly should have caught it) Also, he kept referring to Kat as ""Astley"", when in fact her last name was Ashley.Another annoying factor for me is that the author overdramatizes every single thought, feeling, and facial expression of his main character and those of several others. It gets to be tiresome and a bit soap opera-like after awhile."
3,Mediocre,"The book was OK. Nothing memorable, if you want a real history-mystery, then grab C.J. Sansom's books, they too are about the Tudor court, though at an earlier time. The characters in Gortner's novel are not fully developed, and the plot simply does not make practical sense. It is too fantastical. Another issue that bothered me was how the characters seemed to completely change in a page or two. A weakling and timid man would grab a dagger and defend a damsel in distress, or the strong and iron willed Elizabeth would act like a twelve year old school girl. Overall it's worth the read since it's so short, but do not expect anything especial.PS: I will likely leaf through the second novel, just to see if the author's work has improved."
5,Excellent!,"From the moment I began reading, this book had me in its grasp. I couldn't put it down and found myself reading well into the night. The combination thriller/historical novel worked well together and immediately I found myself transported back during a period in time when murder and intrigue were commonplace. The pace is fast and had me on the edge of my seat almost from the beginning. I was almost sad as I came to the end and I'm looking forward to the next book in the series."
3,"Imaginative, easy to read, but ultimately, too light","This is a highly imaginative tale based on what little is known about the plots surrounding Edward VI's death and the rise of Elizabeth I. It places Robert Dudley, Elizabeth's alleged lover, in the role of pawn to his father's - the Duke of Northumberland - schemes.While entertaining and worthy of a plot for a mystery, the story is not very credible. Therefore, if you prefer historical fiction that remains as true to historical evidence as possible, you may not like it. On the other hand, if you want to read a lightweight mystery for the pure joy of it, I recommend it.Those with a fairly good handle on Elizabethan history will probably find the story hard to swallow. But then it is fiction!"
3,I just don't understand,"i just finished his book, The Tudor Secret, which says on the back is the first of the Spymaster Chronicles. It is about Brendan Prescott, the last days of Edward VI, etc. While looking for the next book in the series, I find this book of a completely different name, but the exact same description."
2,Fell apart,Tres cool. I bought one elsewhere - I saw it in a store.It fell apart in 2 weeks. The screw-in base cap doesn't fit the shell threads well enough to stay put.
1,Try again - or try!!,"Everyting I want to do with a Pocket PC???? How about a reading a E-book?? How about reading a E-book that is ""everything about to do"" about using a e-book. OK!! just buy it in paper back, what is wrong here????? Let me download it!!!"
2,Sub-par unless you're technologically ignorant,"I was excited to get my hands on this book, hoping that it would shed further light on the potential of my already positive Pocket PC experience. This book did little to help me.90% of it's content was pretty much common sense stuff that any person who has got a grasp of Windows and MS Office programs could figure out.I wanted to know how to better manage memory. Do neat tricks with Pocket Word, Excel, and Outlook. All this book points you to is the basics that are in your owner's manual.In comparision to other books on the subject, ""Pocket PC Handbook"" by Dan Hanttula, for example, this book was of little help. If you're looking to improve your knowledge of your Pocket PC go somewhere else. If you no nothing about computers, go someplace else. This book doesn't help unlease the pocket PC's potential. Go someplace else."
2,A little too basic for most,"The book does a good jobs explaining the absolute basics. It goes into extreme depth describing how to play solitaire and using pocket word, however, those users who want descriptions on more advanced topics such as configuring memory cards or solving connectivity problems with other devices such as palm and accessories will be disapointed."
3,Buy it out of necessity,"If you're new to the PDA world, this book covers the basic functions of Pocket PC's fairly well. It even goes through programs like Pocket Word, Excel, etc. in painstaking detail. If you have an iPAQ, you might as well consider this book as the manual since one is not included with the unit.The book does lack substance in areas such as downloading music files, and working with compact flash storage media. Overall, it is a good reference guide."
3,Care Bears 3 in 1 DVD,"The usual care bears stories of teaching values. The graphics were not as good as the newer dvd's. Old school graphics which might still appeal to kids. Dont expect much from the lunch bag it came with, it is just big enough to hold the 3 dvds."
1,Asher's least intersting book,"I'm a big fan of Asher's polity novels, but I didn't find Africa Zero nearly as interesting. This work seems to be mostly an expression of the author's political views, which are approximately those of the Animal Liberation Front and Earth Liberation Front. The hero of the novel, we are told, was responsible for saving the Earth by culling the human population with genetically designed diseases and preditors -- an idea that has emerged in some factions of the British animal rights movement. In other words, he murdered billions of people for ideological reasons, and we are supposed to think he is cool.I have to say, I will be harder for me to enjoy Asher's books after seeing how naive, hostile and anti-American his views are."
4,My 100-word book review,"An early work by Asher, Africa Zero comprises two novellas set in a distant future where the Collector, a lone cyborg with attitude, wages war on an army of religious fanatics. A nice brisk read, this book has the Asher trademarks of high octane action and plenty of big explosions. Fans of his Polity series will recognise the reptilian sauramen as forerunners of the dracomen in later books, but these prototypes are more entertaining. Few science fiction stories are ever set in Africa, let alone feature mammoths, glaciation, vampires and giant crocodiles as well, so this is one to remember."
2,Early Work and Incomplete,"I am writing as a big fan of all of Asher's work, except for this one.Africa Zero is definitely an example of his early and incomplete work that has been published due to his current fame. The story reads more like extensive notes with very little background or plot development just a linear description of events, it also just abruptly ends to leave this reader just hanging. Any fan of Asher will be able to easily recognize the progress and development of the author into the top-notch story-teller that he is today when comparing Africa Zero to any of his more recent writings.Too bad he didn't go back and fill-in the missing parts before this publication , that would have made this a better & more entertaining read. Then again, I think his ""The Owner"" trilogy of The Departure/Zero Point/Jupiter War is probably his revisited & extensively reworked idea of a depleted Earth plotline."
5,A Funky Album,What A Group? adding many Layers to this Unit.Chaka Khan is Funky by Herself.Rufus is a Funky Unit.put together this Group can't be touched on this set.The Grooves go to another Level with Chaka Singing.Chaka&Rufus are a one of a kind Group.Claire Fischer has been bad for many many Years.doing Incredible String work.
3,Thought it was ok!,"Sounded too much like sly and the family stone for me! I was expecting this album to be good,but found alot of the stuff to be a bit to outdated for me. Chaka kahn does an excellent job of performing but the rest of the stuff just kind of sounds blah! To me! If your your really into funk music or you like oldies then youd like this album. I found alot of their other material alot more superior this album."
5,"A logical, concise treatise on Outsoucing","This is a great resource for anyone looking to outsource services. Robin Sood has done an excellent job of creating a very logical, concise manual on Outsourcing and Offshoring. This book lays out the outsourcing process step by step. I found the Executive Briefs at the end of each chapter most helpful. It is on my desk for ready reference!!!!"
2,Evolution,"This book, some may find of value, but in opinion it is poorly written and the art work leaves at to be desired."
1,Anti-God,I had to read this book for a college science class. I don't agree with evolution so it was a hard read for me. It really waters down the possibility of God and actually mocks the idea of a creator through the entire book. Very anti-God and anti-Christianity. ( I had to pick 1 * because it wouldn't let me pick 0 )
5,Loved them,I recently bought these 4 little Dora dolls for my 4 yr old's birthday. She really loves them. She plays with them all the time. It is a nice collection to her Dora stash!
3,A good reference book for non-legal students,"Your Handbook ... is good book if you do not know anything about the law. It includes 30 chapters dealing with Civil and Criminal Procedure to Environmental Law, and everything in between. However, it should be noted that it has a very general approach to the subjects it covers. Over all, its a fine book for people trying to understand the basics of law."
4,good album,The best song on this album is Foxy Brown feat Althea - My life (Cradle to the Grave) Such a humble and profound reflection of being thankful and appreciative of her life struggles.
4,The soundtrack was better than the movie (3 and 1/2 stars),"Dont get me wrong Cradle 2 The Grave had excellent action scenes but the plot was nothing nobody hasnt seen 100x before. Standout Tracks: X GON GIVE IT TO YA(vintage DMX track), GO TO SLEEP(obvious Jarule diss), WHAT'S IT ALL FOR, FOLLOW ME GANGSTER, STOMPDAS***OUTU(dope CNN/MOP match up), MY LIFE(great Foxy Brown track, should have been on Broken Silence), IM SERIOUS(another banger by Clipse), HAND THAT ROCK THE CRADLE and GETTING DOWN. Filler: Joe Buddens delivers a commercial clunker on Drop, Drop, Do Something by Comp is garbage, Baby's wont be coming back is more reason to dislike him, Slangin Dem Thangs(corny) and Focus(YAWN). Bottom Line: Cradle 2 The Grave soundtrack is a lot better than the movie. Songs like Go To Sleep, My Life, Im Serious, X Gon Give It To Ya and Hand That Rocks The Cradle make this soundtrack a worthwhile collector's item."
3,Tight cd but...........................,"This soundtrack is real cool and most of the songs i cant skip. 3 stars cause there r some weak songs. for eg. WHAT'S IT ALL FOR and DO SOMTHIN' i mean comeon. X gonn' give it to ya is a perfect opening. Song is cool and nice beat. Go to sleep desrve better what it is getting. just cause eminem is in it doesn't make it stupid. i know, em. is not the kind like dmx, but in this song he did good. specially the chorus. Follow me gangster is another track you cant skip, no matter what. 50 did his best.Stomp da s**t out is also a good track but i don't know why they put MOP in there. FOcus by kashmir is a tight song. this is first time i heard Kashmir. and i like the vocals.those r da songs i like. others are kind of weak.but it doesn't make it a weak soundtrack.buy it if you have your faovourite rappers in it. they all did their best."
5,Very solid album,Dont have much to say It was just one of the best hip hop soundtrack that I have heard in a long time.
3,one song,the only reason i gave this 3 stars is because of track 3 because of CKY's 96 quite bitter beings guitar riff.
3,Enjoyed It,Yes it's an often told tale but the author does a good job in breathing life into the premise. It's fun watching him track down and dispatch his enemies. They deserve what they get. One weakness is the high profile lifestyle the hero buys with his mentor's money. I would think that finger printing is a part of the vetting process for becoming an owner in the NFL. Any minor scrape that leads to finger printing and it's back to the slammer. This would bother me more than it appears to bother the hero. I liked it enough to try some of the author's other works.
3,A Great Start - A Dissapointing Ending,"During the recounting of the story of the fall of Raymond White and his time in prison, the writing in this book is first rate and one that keeps the reader eagerly looking forward to seeing him carry out the title of the book and exact revenge on his enemies. However, the story of the prison escape, the subsequent identity change and his taking revenge not only require some suspension of belief, but his conduct seems out of character and in some ways the revenge that is taken is an anti-climax. That is disappointing to say the least, and have cost this writer at least two stars in my estimation."
2,Shallow and amateurish,"It's obviously an interesting story concept, since it's patterned after a classic, but the lack of character development is a fatal flaw. In fact, there really aren't any characters, just caricatures: The dirty cop, the weasely politician, the wise old prison cell mate, the unjustly prosecuted hero, etc.I generally like Tim Green's work, but this was a real disappointment."
2,Disappointed,"I am a big fan of Tim Green. His previous books have always been excellent. Then we come to Exact Revenge.From the beginning of the book, it felt as though the storytelling was offputting. Somehow the introduction of the characters was stilted and ackward.I usually don't like to have too many details in the stories I read, but this book was incredibly short on the important ones and made me feel as though I was reading a report intead of a thriller.There was no ebb and flow at all and this book was just a major disappointment."
3,"It was ""OK""","I started The Count of Monte Cristo several years ago, but I didn't last very long with it. (I must've been in 6th or 7th grade then, I'm a senior in high school now.) I'd only picked it up because I'd seen the movie, and I'd decided to watch that because the plot intriqued me. This book seemed like a good read because the prospect of a modern-day setting made completion seem feasible.I just finished the book a few minutes ago. At the beginning, it was interesting to see events that coincided with the original story. The story flowed fairly well, generally moving smoothly except for places where it felt like Green put in pointless details.In the end, I feel there's room for more. Even with my mediocre sense for recognizing symbolism, I could sort of predict where the plot would go. The plot could have been more involved, more complicated, more intriguing - something that I had expected to be a quality of a drawn-out revenge."
2,Disappointing,"Although on a number of levels this was a fun read, I'm afraid it left me feeling let down when I was finished. My primary complaint (and, for me, a genuine problem)is that the characterizations are extremely weak. The main and principal subordinate characters are just not well-developed, and rely way too much on cliche and sterotype to be believable. More important- and perhaps fatally, from this reader's point of view- is that I never developed a strong sense of really caring about any of them. There are also a number of places throughout the story where the plot is stretched so thin you can hear it beginning to tear.In general, the writing's not bad, but there a few lapses here, as well.It's an entertaining story (how could it not be, given its inspiration in Dumas?), and will make a good beach read. Hard to take seriously, however."
3,"Interesting story, but very dark and violent.","This was the least favorite of all his novels. Raymond and Lexis were a characters I initially liked, however as the story progressed and the act of revenge began, the book became uncomfortable for me to read. The dialog is permeated with the 'f' word and the characters are slimy. There was no feeling, on my part, of satisfaction or pleasure with the conclusion. I could sum it all up by saying, ""Yuck""."
4,"Local ""enjoyablility""","Great book.. Love Tim's writing. His story lines are always enticing the reader to want more... His ability to ""take you there"" is a great asset. I am from his ""neck of the woods"" so I thoroughly enjoy the descriptive local settings.... A very multi-talented man...."
2,1st half good,"The first half of this book was really good, right up until he gets out of prison. Then, it became way too deluted with unessesary details and rambled on and on until the less than satisfying end."
2,Not Particularly Plausible,"Now, I like to read some escapist thriller stuff every once in a while. And this tale of betrayal and revenge started off promisingly enough. But then, all of a sudden, it went off the deep end. Fiction necessitates, of course, that the reader be able to suspend disbelief. But this book literally made me laugh out loud at the absurdity of some of its premises. I guess I just prefer my outlandish unbelievability to be in the form of an over-the-top know-it-all like Sherlock Holmes or Agent Pendergast from the Preston and Child novels. This book read like a drunken, unlimited, ""what if I win the lottery"" wish fulfillment. And it just didn't wash."
3,Exact and deadly revenge,"Raymond White has a great job, a beautiful fiancée, and a terrific future. It is all wiped away when he is framed for a murder he did not commit. Sent away for life, he does twenty years before he meets Lester Cole, a wise old man, and a career thief and killer. Together they break out of jail. Raymond transforms himself into Seth Cole, in honor of his buddy Lester. Raymond seeks to repay his debts; rescue his supporters and destroy those who destroyed him. The action is quick and exciting, leading up to when they break out of jail, and when Raymond gets his revenge. Why were people so oblivious to his motives? With the immense amount of money Raymond tosses around thanks to Lester; why didn't anyone question him further? His reunion with Lexis was predictable. The author's popularity garnered the attention more so than the story deserved."
3,Excellent First Half Okay Second Half,"Overall a decent read. The first half of the story was excellent. The second half was okay. The story seemed to get garbled in the last half with too many events going on at the same time and things changing too quickly. One minute Seth is on a plane, the next he's in some obscure place in Russia, and the next minute he's sitting at his home with a drink in his hand overlooking a lake, and the next minute his girlfriend is hiding in the drapes. Silly really. Full of mystery, intrigue, and adventure. This is not Green's best writing, but certainly not his worst. If you liked the Count of Montecristo, you will like this story told in contemporary terms."
4,zen case and charger,the car and home charger are great. The case does a good job of protecting the zen but lacks features available for 30gb cases such as a bracket to prop it up for viewing the screen. I am happy with the case tho to keep the zen from being damaged.
2,ok book ....I've read better....,Ok book ....I've read better.........When Misery is Company: End Self-Sabotage and Become Content.....I donated it to the public library!~I stopped and did not waste my time finishing it!`
5,This is a groundbreaking book,"Anne Katherine has added to an already impressive series of books with When Misery is Company. The idea that there is an umbrella disorder that encompasses many others is thrilling. She presents her material in clear, gripping language. I couldn't stop reading, as the ideas drew a picture that explains why so many people cannot stop leading miserable lives. I'm a therapist and I think this book will be of immense help to both therapists and clients alike."
3,"Decent Book, Obnoxious Author","The book itself is pretty good. I happen to like the H.O.T. (Hands On Training) Series. But the Author is really annoying. I totally agree with the post here titled ""Cutesy and Wordy."" The text is littered with winking smileys. For example, the text in front of me says the following:""Save the changes to this page and leave it open for the next exercise. Please. ;-)""Lame. And even lamer, on the next page it says:""The document ... should still be open. If not, go ahead and open it now. I will wait right here.""It's full of stuff like that, which I don't really want from a book.But if you can tolerate that, I think it's a pretty good book overall. I did find several mistakes that slowed me down a bit, but if you're intelligent enough to realize that there might be mistakes, you shouldn't have too many problems. Also, I heard from my classmates that this book isn't as Mac-friendly as they had expected."
1,Terrible,"I had to buy this book for a class, it is terrible. All the author does is have you go click here and drag this to go through the exercises with no explainations. It's a waste of time and money."
5,"This is ""The Book"" !!!!","Full of examples, the author literally takes you by the hand to show you every aspect of designing a web page. Examples, movie presentations, clear explanations, lot of practice, this is the book that easily replaces a much more expensive on-class training worth close to a a thousand dollars.The book states that is not necessary to know XHTML coding to start reading this book. I disagree! The readings are much more faster if you already know a bit of XHTML programming."
3,Needs More Umpf,"The title was fitting for the content, and explained a lot of previously misunderstood personal characteristics, but the book stopped there.More detail, more description, more ""what do I do now"" would have been more helpful. I've since donated the book to the library."
1,Condescending psychobabble,"While there may be some useful information in this book, it's not worth the time it takes to wade through Dr. Jan's drivel to find it. Even a broken clock is right twice a day. Families with alcoholic members don't fit into a mold - just like ""normal"" families don't fit into a mold. Save your time and money. Skip this book."
4,Great tool as homework,"As a pastoral counselor, I have given many copies of this volume to ACOA clients in recent years. As a homework tool, I encourage them to read it and bring any observations they develop into the next few sessions. It has never failed to do exactly that."
4,Excellent book,Great information on the background for those of us who grew up in an alcoholic home. I learned a lot about myself
5,oh the answers that are in here...,What a tremendous insight to so many struggles our family lines have faced and the impact they have... and how what we choose will impact future generations. A frightening and yet somehow comforting work...
3,A Good Start,"This book is a decent introduction to the subject for others, like me, who are beginning to explore their past and the effect it has had on their lives. However, IT WILL NEVER HAPPEN TO ME, by Claudia Black, was far more helpful. It is written more clearly and simplifies concepts; it also has fewer absolutes, which may or may not apply to any given reader. For example, Woititz's book states that one characteristic of an adult-child-of-an-alcoholic is that he/she will ""lie when the truth would be better."" This most emphatically doesn't apply to me. It's not as well-written as Black, either. I'd recommend you start with Black, and then move on to RECOVERY: A GUIDE FOR ADULT CHILDREN OF ALCOHOLICS by Gravitz and Bowden."
5,the man in the mirror is here,"this book described me. although i did not grow up with my alcoholic father, all of my dilemnas and personal crises are in full detail here. the reasons for my loneliness, my sadness, my seriousness, and more are all told here. it's a short read; i've read the earlier version, and although i have not seen the expanded version, it makes sense 4 everyone to pick this up if you feel the need for help due to your past with parents who drank. it does also seem to hit other dysfunctions, such as co-dependency. i have read quite a number of self-help books, and i did see some of the same type of problems and advice. not to worry if you find the same thing to be true. reading essential, life-nurturing advice is something that cannot be heard or seen enough. valuable reading."
4,Excellent summary,"This is an excellent summary of the issues and contains a lot of explanations and sense. However, the second part is somewhat repetitive, and the audience seems to be the actual ACoA, not the people who live with him or her. In other words, there is very little guidance for those of us who live with Joan Crawford in terms of techniques and advice (e.g., how do we ""detach""? Is that even helpful or recommended?). A good starting place for understanding."
5,This summed up my whole life and helped me heal,"This book crossed my path in my early twenties and helped merecognize a life pattern as the result of being born intoa family of alcoholics. Due to its guidance, I joined the12-step programs adult children of alcoholics and codependentsanonymous (among others).Twenty years later, I am happily married and successfullydealing with my codependency patterns. I now set boundaries,now have self-esteem, and am able to discern whats ""my stuff""and ""your baggage"" and don't take yours on as ""my problem"" anymore. Thank you very much Janet Woititz! By the way, I haverecommended this book to more than 500 people in my counselingwork over the years. No one ever reported back that it was awaste of time."
4,Applicable To More Than Just Alcoholics,"Good and insightful book. Though it focuses on the repercussions of alcoholism, the points that Woititz makes can be adapted to pertain to many different ""broken home"" situations. While I did not experience the dysfunctional family issues she discusses, my older brothers did - and Janet's observations about siblings based on birth order are remarkably accurate. I don't claim to know a lot about the field of psychology but I imagine this must be a seminal work for substance abuse."
2,"Well written, helpful author","I recently purchased this book on Amazon and dug in. The technology does not get in the way of the message and the author has a light humor which makes the learing process go faster. Incidentally, I had a question so I left an email for the author, and got a personal response the next day, clearing up my question. I recomend this book and other titles written by this person."
2,"A decent read, but don't expect to be programming anything real after this book","I got this book because of the good reviews, but I promptly returned it and got Head First Java, which is much more comprehensive. I got over the usual ""for dummies"" annoyances like the constant joking and the constant referrals to other chapters. What I couldn't get over was that this book did not go far enough. I know that it is for beginners, but this book really doesn't teach you very much at all. If it was to be a real beginner's book, maybe the author should have spent more time discussing HOW the code works and much less on the actual Java language. There also should be exercises to do on your own, and there aren't any at all. That would have offered the most value for beginner programmers.In short, if you just want to read about programming, get this book. If you actually want to do some of it, this book isn't for you."
4,Excellent Prep Material,"This book was a fun read! My review can be summed up by the following five points:1) Burd makes the subject matter painless with his light and at times anecdotal writing. (good)2) This book goes extremely slow. But that is *NOT* a bad thing if you are new to java / programming. (good)3) I got the java text for my 'promgramming in java, 101' course, and those authors put a *LOT* more emphasis on the importance / use of objects. Something Burd doesn't seem to stress enough. (bad)4) You will not ""learn java."" Rather, you will learn how to make quick command line programs to accomplish simple tasks. (bad)5) Excellent starter book. This book gives you look at the good, the bad, and the frustrating! (good)Obviously, this is a weighted scale (refer to 4-star rating).Recommended for anybody interested in Java / programming who has not had *any* training in either."
5,a message to Dr. Burd,"I offer my review in the form of an email I recently sent to the author:Dr. Burd,I have to tell you how much I love your Java programming book. I've been searching for a way into the mysterious world of programming for quite some time, and yours is the best by far! A few years ago I took a intro programming class in which BASIC was used as the learning tool. Unfortunately it bored me to tears. In my quest for a successful self-study course I had trouble finding a book that kept me engaged. That is until I found your book! Thank you for finally giving me a route to programming that works for me!"
2,Basic - but with errors,I got until page 164 before I had the first error.Having downloaded the latest version of Eclipse and Java SDK; I have come about several errors where the book's code is too old !!It's a shame to now learn the hard way (having bought 4 books) that the book MUST be about a specific JAVA version; or else you'll risk stranding somewhere with only Google to help you :-/I'm now at page 219 in the book; and have completely run out of luck. Sad for a nOOb like me; but that shouldn't be possible with a F&%& Dummies Book !!!!(just because of typos and old code!!)
5,"Well done, Dr. Burd","I haven't done any programming in over 20 years (Fortran, Cobol, Basic and the like) so I was hesitant to jump into Java. Dr. Burd's book has made my re-entry into programming utterly enjoyable. Step by easy step the book guides you through all of the computerese and jargon and in only a couple of days I was half way through the book. Thanks Dr. Burd. Chocolate and royalties, indeed!"
4,Take it with a Grain of Salt,"This is a great book for learning Java, and it gets you into the code quickly, but he has some proprietary functions that you use that are not used in normal Java programming, so keep this in mind. I prefer the Dummies version of C++ because I think it stays much closer to the real code rather than creating code snippets that you will never be able to use in the industry. I know he's just trying to get you going on the code, but I wish it didn't include that provision."
3,What I expected....,I wish the textbook had more sample codes. It does a decent job of going over the basics of programming. Between this book and my textbook its making my intro to programming class better.
3,Get Down to Business!,"Barry Burd wastes so much space trying to be cute and funny that it is a real chore to search for the important bits of information in this book. I don't want to be entertained, I just was to learn Java in as few pages as possible."
3,Way too short!!!,"When I put down my money for this one, I had no idea that finishing more than half the book would still not have me ""out of diapers"" as a programmer.I feel that its fine for a book to be introductory, and this book does a fabulous job of that, BUT...For this price, it really out to be about twice as long, and coer far more material thereby...I have only browsed the book by Schildt ""Java 2 Beginner's guide"" butthat one looks like its a far better introductory book.I was so frustrated on getting through the bulk of this Dummies book without really getting my feet wet, that I rushed out to the store (12 miles away!) and bought myself a copy of ""A Beginner's Guide"".You can learn from my mistake: don't get dummies, but go right toSchildt's book.""Blessed are those who do hunger and thirst for good programming books, for they shall be satisfied...""Have fun!Doug"
3,Beginning Programming with Java For Dummies,"The book does what it says it is suppose to do. A little on the chatty side, but easy to use and understand. It is NOT a comprehensive book on Java. The exercises/programming samples can be used in any development platform since the author sticks to simple code. Does have some code that can be used in most programs but overall it's too basic of a book --but for what I paid, it is a good purchase."
5,Good reference book,I ordered it for my son for a beginning glance at programming. It looks like a decent starting point and hope to review t more myself.
4,Learn Java From The Begining,The instructions are very clear on doing the practice runs. I'm only at chapter 9 at the time of this review. Some of the definitions of how the program is constructed are a little confusing. Over all it has everything you need to run programs successfully.
5,Easy to Read,This book is very easy to read and understand. Anyone trying to learn Java this is a great book to start learning with. You will not go wrong purchasing this book.
2,Could be better,"Disappointed with the sound quality of this item. Cheap construction and it cuts out even at close range. If you touch the receiver, it screws up the signal for a while. Spend a few more bucks and get a better one. I rarely use this one now...."
1,Don't Jump! The Northwest Winter Blues Guide,"Where are all the stars coming from? I bought this book, and I was highly dissapointed. I was looking for useful information on diet, light therapy, vitamins, etc. that would actually help you survive the real winter blues - seasonal attitude diplacement disorder. This book was written for someone who doesn't have a life and needs to be told stupid little things to do to keep from being bored. All you 5 star people - get a life! P.S. If you look real hard you might find vitamin info in a one liner somewhere in this book. Otherwise it's mostly nonsense."
2,Great Movie But Below Average Soundtrack,"Don't waste your money on this soundtrack. They left the best song off. The song where they are at the party, eating food. Borrowed my brothers, and I gave it back to him two days later. I will say its a bit melodic, so it might make ok background music but that's it. Dony waste your XViii money on this."
1,I loved the flick,"but the CD soundtrack by itself is a major disappointment. a common thread of beat and sound links all the tracks with one drum and one cello. After a few go-rounds, it becomes grating and tiresome. I would pass on this soundtrack and wait for the DVD for a few more dollars."
1,Not happy,"My charger quit working, and I noticed just after the 30 day return period was up through the seller (Vanns). Lenmar wants me to pay to ship it back to them. I'm not going to pay half what the thing cost to ship it back to them. Instead I'm going to go and buy a charger from a reputable company at a local store. That way, if it's turns out to be a cheap piece of junk like this one, at least I'll be able to return it easily."
1,Died!,"The Lanmar looked like a good charger, but it died (without telling me) after a couple of months. It goes through the charging routine, and the lights indicate that the batteries are charged. When I put them into the camera - no good. It took me a while to find out which charger was not working. Waste of my money. I've had chargers that worked fine for years, but this is not one of them. It's not worth the postage to return it."
4,"Easy to use, but","Removing AAA batteries from the charger is a real pain. Also, you must be careful when inserting AAA batteries to be certain that they are pushed in all the way."
4,great book,only complaint is the pendulum is a bit plain and the string that is tied to it is less than adequate. You'll have to find a necklace or something else that hangs straight. The book is awesome and the pendulum is good enough.
4,Fun,"Ive been doing things like this for years, but have never had my own pendulum or actual instruction, this is a great starter to dowsing and how we can still use it today"
5,FREAKING AWESOME BOOK!,"I have always dowsed with dowsing rods and have been very successful. I purchased my first pendulum about one month ago. I used it several times, and it seemed to work fine for me. I purchased this book to get more information on using a pendulum but did not realize how much I learned in just 48 hours. I read this book from start to finish in only two days! This book is difficult to put down! The exercises in this book were so awesome! You need to try this for yourself!!! I felt so good about my dowsing skills after a few of these exercises! Thank you for writing such a great book, and for the charts! This book is worth every dollar !!"
1,This didn't help me at all,This didn't help me at all I wouldn't recommend it. The author assumes that you know more that I did. It doesn't help to have all the equipment if you can't figure out how to use it.
2,The Pendulum Kit Review (Purchased at Amazon.com,"I had this kit once before years ago. As I remember it had a chain then rather then the string it uses now to attach to the pendulum. Also I remember the pendulum being larger however, that was quite a few years ago and I could be wrong. In any case I would not purchase the kit again.However, a positive compliment concerning the book that comes with the kit: The book is very nice and informative. I do recommend the book."
1,The Pendulum Kit,"I am so sorry, but I can't share my opinion because at this time I haven't received the book I bougth. I don't know what happened because it has been enough time for this"
5,Must read book for every serious investor!!!!,I came across the book a little while ago. Bought it read it and read again. Do my investing only on the way Ben explains and make a lot of money. Value investing is a save way to invest in these times of high exchanges all over the world. Also read security analyses. A very good book on the matter explained in 'the intelligent investor' I love it and I keep on investing in this way.
5,Making money is always fundamental,"Clear, concise, excellent reference for value investing. A book you will want to keep in your permant collection to re-read five or ten years hence. Explains many concepts in understandable terms. Available for less than 1/4 of a point of one stock. Don't go to Wall Street without it!"
5,The Past Has Some Of The Answers,There is no doubt that Benjamin Graham's insights and expertise have shaped the science of portfolio management to what it is today. It is also nice to look at a book like this and realize that literally there is nothing new under the sun. There have been daytraders and charlatans since the inception of the stock market. That being the case Benjamin Graham's approach to value investing will never go out of style. In a sea of volatility buying value is the only way to go.
3,Can't Say I Was Wild About This Book,"""The Intelligent Investor"" is good at convincing you not to pay too much for a stock. However, as Mary Buffett points out in her book ""Buffettology"", Warren Buffett gradually ran into problems with a pure Benjamin Graham approach to investing. Graham would buy ANY stock if it were cheap enough, hoping the price would soon rise. He often found that many cheap stocks never went up. He also incurred lots of capital gains taxes which Warren Buffett likes to avoid. It sounds like Buffett is more influenced by Philip Fisher now than by Ben Graham. I would recommend reading ""Buffettology"" before ""The Intelligent Investor"". After reading ""Buffettology"", then start reading books by Ben Graham, Philip Fisher, and John Burr Williams."
2,"Buffet's endorsement notwithstanding, short this book...","If you are a novice investor seeking to acquire knowledge about the greased tightrope walk which is investing, you're better off not wasting your time with this dust-caked historical artifact. For one, it's completely outdated. For another, Graham writes in the most constipated of didactic tones. For a third, I found little of actual, relevant, timeless value to the tyro. (The chapter on dividend policy is worth a once-over.)Pick up A Random Walk Down Wall Street by Burt Malkiel, instead."
1,This Book doesn't stand the test of time.,"This book was last updated sometime in the late 70's. Unfortunately, the advice is not only outdated but simply wrong. For example, Graham believed that in the late 70's that the stock market was overvalued. However, just a view years after this book was published the great bull market of the 80's began and appears to be going strong. Security Analysis was a much better book."
3,A must read!,"Because ""Intelligent Investor"" is almost four decades old, I've given this three stars...Although the examples in this book are outdated, I think it is a must read for the beginning investor.For the investor looking for a safer and a more contrarian approach, this is a must addition for your investment library. I've done well with this strategy buying everything from technology to oil service stocks.The ""Intelligent Investor"" approach attempts to guide the investor in the direction of capital presevartion while waiting for stock appreciation.Stick to the strategy and HAVE PATIENCE! Over time, most of your stock picks will let you sleep well at night as well as get nice returns.Another book to consider and mold into this strategy is ""Contrarian Investing"" by Gallea & Patalon."
5,the intelligent investor,"Informative; provacative to would be investors & inspirational to anyone seeking to learn the cold hard facts of how to""best"" invest for the furure.Even though there are no guarantees; this book underlines the basic principals to steer the the unlearned in the right direction.It is not only a ""must read"", but shuold be manditory for any investor who wants to assure themselves of profitable investing."
3,Way Too Complicated for a Novice Investor,If you are a beginner to novice investor stay away from this book. The language and the applications of theories and terminology is just too much for the average investor to grasp. Gradually work your way up to this one.
1,Waste of money,"Don't waste your time or money on this ""book"" - it's nothing more than a photocopied pamphlet stapled together, and the information is poorly organized and written."
3,Nothing new here,"In reading this, I found it to be a rehash of information freely available on the Internet. I had hoped for more.It feels like I paid to have someone gather and print it out for me."
4,Nicely condensed version of Tesla's invention,"This 34 page ""pamphlet"" does an good job of an overview of Tesla and his ideas. It shows the progression of his ideas and also helps the reader to better understand and debunk all the junk science now being espoused concerning Tesla's theories and inventions."
3,very old patents - can be interesting,the book is an interesting collection - perhaps more valuable for evaluating spoof patents - and arcane ideas than for building any of these devices. there is probably a reason most of this has not been published. The book succeeds in vividly portraying the era after the civil war - post-modern science - and the ideas the permiated culture.Anyone reading this is bound to have a great appreciation for Tesla - and a better understanding of the times he lived in.
2,Where's the rest of it?,"I guess I was expecting a work with a little more substance. 9 pieces of 8.5""x14"" paper stock folded in half and stapled into what can only be regarded as a pamphlet, was less voluminous than a ""15 minute"" car insurance policy quote. Though it is reported that these inventions were suppressed by the U.S. Government, it is important to note that all of which have been in the public domain for at least 50 years. I can honestly say that I learned nothing new from reviewing this text, which by the way, I was able to absorb in one trip to the lavatory. Not worth the $7.75 I was duped into paying. Perhaps I can find some 12 year old electronics nerd to pass it on to as they may have not been exposed to the material, though it seems unlikely to find such a rare specimen in this connected world."
3,nothing new,I had already read everything that was in this book on line A waste of time and money. my time and my money
2,Not enough information,The book was very cheaply done. I found much clearer and better definedmaterial about Tesla on UTUBE. Would not recommend this book.
2,Tesla's lost inventions,"I am looking for a book that describes and explains how Tesla inventions work. This book doesn't has been useful.It is a cheap book but it isn't a book about the story of Tesla inventions and it isn't a technical book. It is like a brochure. In my opinion it is useless. If you are interested in Tesla work a better book is for example: ""Harnessing the wheelwork of nature: Tesla Science of energy"" by T. Valone. Good luck"
5,Tesla: Lost Inventions,Very good booklet. Primes the reader for further reading and research into Tesla's inventions. Well worth the price.
4,Tesla,"A fairly good book on some of Tesla's obscure work.Tesla inventer AC power, and some of his work is stillnot well understood. Data is sparce, but engineersare beginning to look back into his notes and patents."
5,EMMITT SMITH NFL WAR STORIES,EMMITT SMITH SAM WYCHE & ROCKY BLIER A TRUE AMERICAN HERO50 MINUTES OF NFL WAR
3,Fine writer. Not great at endings.,"The author certainly keeps you turning pages, but her endings are either obvious or contrived (I read all her books). That being said, I probably will read anything she writes because she is so engaging. You can't have everything."
1,The Merlot Murders,This book wasn't so good. Some interesting info on wines and winemaking. The characters weren't fully developed. I forced myself to finish it.
4,First time reader of this author,"It was a good book. It was new to me, have not read this series, enjoyed it. A different writer, took me a bit to catch the flow of the writing, but did enjoy it. I look forward to reading others in the series."
5,Excellent Mystery!,"I read a mystery every night before bed and I am always looking for a series that I can enjoy in its entirety. Well, I found one! The writing is well-crafted, the characters are unique and I like that the main character (Lucie) has a deformed foot and has to use a cane to get around. She is a gutsy female character and I liked her from the beginning. I have now read book 2 in this series and can't wait for the next one (I bought all six after I read this one)."
2,Not feeling this at all......,The characters were way too nice (hero and heroine) and he was definitely not agressive enough for me...I did like the fact that she was not your typical slim and slender female...we do come in all different sizes...but he was just too sweet..and I didn't expect that from a man who had an earring in his ear...not feeling this one at all...Total Bliss was much better..this is okay if you're looking for a sweet romance...has some good intimate scenes..but not for me...
3,Overpriced,"It is sad to see that the author who was removed as a speaker by the publishing organization is attempting to profit from the sale of this book which is sold at cost by the organization itself for $12 including shipping. In fact the author's ego was so ""badly dented"" he has become the most outspoken critic of the organization. I can't fault the content. Hines is an intelligent man (now with a dented ego), and he has distilled the tenets and philosophy very well. Its just poor show that he seeks to profit from the writings which are more accessible directly from the publishers.[...]"
3,A little small,"This kettle is lovely and a real plus in my kitchen decor, but I was disappointed with the size. Maybe if the measurements had been given I'd have realized it was a bit small. One plus of the small size is how quickly the water heats!"
1,This is NOT the Canon cable,"The cable sent is not the white Canon cable shown, and is not the Canon part number advertised. It is not even a Canon product. No bulging part near the small connector, no embossed Canon logo, not white. Not Canon's proprietary cable.The ad should show a photo of the product they are really selling and should not claim to BE the Canon part number.I have asked to return for credit, I hope they honor the request."
1,It doesn't have the round cylinder ball like in the picture.,"Well, what can I say? I disliked this purchase so much, I didn't even try to get a refund. I just wouldn't buy any product from this seller again. That's how you can save money in the future.The cable I ordered is not the same as the one in the picture and it doesn't work with the camcorder I have. It's missing the ball in the middle."
4,Canon USB Cable IFC-400PCU,"Product was not as pictured and it is not a Canon cable. It is a generic USB digital camera cable and is black not white, does not bear the Canon logo. But it works just fine and the price was definitely right."
5,Good as Original,Our puppy chewed apart the original cable for our Canon SD500 and the first replacement. This cable works perfectly and was less expensive than the one we purchased at Best Buy. The CPU has been moved to protect the cable from the puppy.
2,"NOT A GENUINE CANON PRODUCT, But a Generic Knock Off","Item IS NOT MADE BY CANON as described, it was not white, as in photo, but black, did not have the damper adaptors on the USB wire as original does, and was not flexible but very rigid. Clearly a Cheaply made Knock Off sold as a Genuine Canon IFC-400PCU USB Cable. VERY DISAPPOINTED, and will throw item away, and look for a better Quality item"
1,NOT THE RIGHT CABLE!,"This is not the right cable. It is not as advertised. It is a generic cable, and it does not fit into the port of my Canon ZR80. Therefore: a waste."
5,Good Stuff,The cord works very well and was a great price compared to the legit stuff from canon. Also works for my external hard drive from western digital which is also awesome.
1,Doesn't work with the Canon PowerShot A570IS,"I was happy to save $12 and get this cable, but it doesn't work with my camera, the PowerShot A570IS. I have read other customer's reviews and they are completely satisfied with the cable. It doesn't matter to me that it is a generic cable and not as advertised, but I hate that I wasted money for the product and shipping and now have to buy the cable from Canon - probably what I should have done to begin with."
1,Canon USB Cable,"This cable does not ""fit"" into my Canon camera. It would seem that it is designed for a different type of output. On close inspection there is a slight difference in the plug that inserts into the camera! It is totally worthless."
3,Product good - shipping slow,I was expecting a much faster turn around for such a small item they were to mail to me.
5,Works Great,The product works like it should and I am glad I bought it. I would recommend it to anyone who needs a cable for their camera.
1,You sent me the wrong item!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The first and only time I have ordered something from your company, you sent me the wrong item. Instead of sending me a 'Canon USB Cable IFC 400PCU' for my Canon Camera, you sent me a generic usb without the cylindrical filter/buffer that should be attached to the cord and which is shown in the picture for the item I purchased. I would say that I was displeased with my purchase and most likely will not buy anything from you again. Thank you very much and have a Wonderful Holiday season."
1,defective,The 98% rating it deceptive...the product sent to me did not work at all. I plugged it into my computer and my computer showed that nothing was plugged in. Do not trust this seller.
4,Just what my friend needed,"This was something that my friend asked me to buy, because his cable had some difficulties in linking to his computer. With this new one apparently thing came back to normal."
4,Canon USB Cable,"Lots of gadgets equals lots of cables, and unmarked cables at that. I've had the camera for a couple of years and the cable was/is misplaced. However, at this price it was worth the lack of frustration to purchase a new one and that's what I did. It works fine, the shipping was fast, and I have labeled this one! It was hard to choose a vendor and price. The cable is relatively cheap and one vendor advertised it at less than a dollar. I was afraid that one was a knock-off brand or such so I chose one that had, in my opinion, a more legitimate price though still inexpensive. The only reason for four stars versus five stars is that I don't ""love"" this item. I like it and it is necessary."
5,USB Cable,"Just a standard USB cable (not Canon brand, from what I can tell), but works just fine at a fraction of the cost."
1,NOT THE CANON CABLE,THIS IS NOT THE CANON CABLE. This is a RIPOFF. It is just the normal USB cable that you find with USB accessory/peripheral. I am so mad that I ordered and waited 10 days for this ....wasted all this time. The Canon cable is supposed to have a USB at one end and a really miniature mini USB at the other end. Does not work with ANY SDXXX series cameras.Even the invoice specified USB111-A cable without any mention of the the Canon USB IFC-400PCU cable that I had ordered.
4,replacement usb cable,"Lost usb cable for Canon camera.Unable to download and print school pictures,very happy to have found replacement and have it delivered so quickly!!!"
2,"Be careful - works for ""select"" blackberries (not mine!)","This tip arrived quickly and ""works"" so I would prefer not to give it a rating per se, but Amazon won't let me - I just didn't read the description carefully enough. I have the Blackberry BOLD, and this one did not work with my phone. I need a mini mini USB I think...still not sure which number..."
2,Tip bent after only sharot usage with car charger,Tip bent after only small amount of usage with car charger.I was unable to use this after about 10 times of charging with the car charger. It worked until the tip started coming loose and would only connect sporadically. It's cheap enough but it should have been more robust.
3,"iGo system is great, the A29 tip is just ok","The iGo system of having a single plus with multiple tips for all your electronics is great. However, the blackberry tip (A29) has given me some trouble. For some time the tip worked just fine, then one day on a business trip, it just stopped charging on both my blackberry's. My other tips worked ok - just this one is giving me problems. I'm on to my second tip now.I wouldn't necessarily discourage someone from buying (still a great system) but I think you need to be aware that the reliability isn't 100%."
1,Not as advertised,I bought this to charge my wife's Blackberry. I plugged it in an disconnected it in the morning to find the phone was completely dead. I do not know why it didn't work but it did not.
1,1970????,When was this made in the 70's? It is terrible.Low budget and hard to watch because the production was so bad. Don't wzaste your money.
1,"Bad, Real Bad","Well, there was another review here, but that one seems to have been removed, this is very, very, basic software, no font effects really (has some 3D effects, but does not always work), it looks like this was just a stop-gap measure to get something out that is Vista compatible (it is that), lots more missing in this then probably Print Shop version 3 (19 versions ago)"
5,LGB Collector,"This item was supposed to be ""Like New"", but it is not. I would say it is in Very Good condition for its age, as it does have minor shelfwear on the bottom of the spine, with the binding coming apart. Otherwise it is is great condition.... and an ""A"" printing!"
4,Wrestling at its finest,"Ring of Honor is the last true wrestling company that gets a lot of press in the US for the content of its MATCHES. This is a simple look at some of the wrestlers who have moved on to the ""Big Two"" - showing that they COULD wrestle before WWE and TNA taught them to follow a skit manual. Samoa Joe, CM Punk and so many more in matches that show respect to the lost art of a wrestling match. Awesome wrestling in a bare bones production - As close to ECW as we will ever see. I hope the new owner of ROH will put them in the running and make them a brand to watch!"
4,eerie,"I like this series of cd's. This particular one gives me different feelings. Maybe it has something to do with the lunar cycles or something. At times I feel so calm and full of Love, but at others, it can seem very eerie and strange when listening. Either way, it definately does something and overall my experience is quite positive. Maybe the weirdness is from within and this cd helps to bring it out,clearing it, because eventually I always feel clear and light."
2,Didn't Meet Expectatiions.,I was looking for something calming and soothing while I work. The sounds are too mono tone and bland. Not much of a calming affect as I hoped. It just didn't meet my expectations.
5,Outstanding,I liked the one CD so much that I gave it to a friend and bought the 2 CD set which I like even better. These are really lovely.
4,Quite relaxing,"Its a good cd. I listen to it when im driving home from work. it has a nice mellow sound, that helps you to relax. Good Stuff!!!"
1,Make sure you listen to the sample,"That's the mistake I did -once I received the CD, I found out I can't bear to listen to it more than a minute - it sounds so sinister and scary for me, get the headache and can't tolerate it...Far cry from serenity...Other Dr. Ts CDs are amazing and work for me really well (check Theta 2.0 and Healing CDs)So make sure it's for you before you order :)"
5,Plant Anyway!,I am a bit biased because Felder is one of my favorite MPB radio hosts. The Mississippi Fruit and Vegetable Book is wonderful because it explains the basics of properly setting up a garden and highlights popular (and not so popular) plants without intimidating beginners. This book is easy to read and contains valuable information for starting and maintaining food producing plants.
2,Support lacking,"Overall the product is decent, handles load well. The main problem is getting support for the VPN portion. I have numerous calls in and have bounced around the support queue for some time. When I have a few hours free I will try again, until then...no VPN for me."
4,solid product,"This VPN tunnel has been solid since Day 1. Good connections, good speeds when traveling. Can be accessed from a variety of WAN locations and services. Also network switching is solid too. Netgear interface for configs is easy to work with and understand."
5,compulsively readable,"What an honest portrayal of one woman's search! Favreau is disarming in her stark admission of the wandering path her life took, leading her to God. Her voice is funny and real. I read the book at every spare moment (and I have small children, so they are few!)She has amusing and quotable insights on spiritual searching, religious denominations and atheism. And she includes a short list of further reading, which I plan to follow.I've already loaned my copy to an interested friend. And if this book came in a Large Print edition I'd be buying it for my mother and her friends. They'd love it."
1,What Did She Do To These Songs,"I can't believe that people think this woman is good. I bought this album because all of my friends said ""She's Better than Barbra!"" I had to plug my ears through half of the album. Who is the engineer in the studio? This woman might have wind power, but did they ever hear of a compressor? She almost breaks my eardrums, and my speakers will never be the same. Very bad taste in recording. There is nothing pretty in being screamed at constantly. If I wanted to hear that kind of stuff, I would buyChristine Aguilera. But Christine at least lowers the pace and puts interesting inflection into her music. Linda Eder is one blaring tornado all the way through the album. I will sell this on the used format immediately."
4,"Not Streisand, but better than Celine Dion","I've heard Linda singing ""LIVE"" on several occasions while promoting this CD recently. Mrs. Eder is good enough to be a good ""pop"" singer, but I never understood why people compare Linda to the one and only Streisand. Streisand has a one of a kind voice, and Linda has her own. Mrs. Eder's voice is somewhat ""thin"". I rather compare her with Celine Dion, but not the legendary Barbra Streisand."
4,Essential Eder,"Linda Eder comes through once again with her wonderful Broadway ablum. The songs she has chosen fully highlight her fantastic range from alto to soprano and her beautiful vocal abilities. One plus to her repetoire on this album is that she has chosen some well-known songs and some not so well-known. I especially like ""Anthem"" from Chess, her interpretation of ""Edelweiss"" from The Sound of Music, ""Unusual Way"" from Nine and ""The Man of La Mancha"".Fantastic recording and essential for any Eder fan, new and old!"
5,Broadway - - The ONLY Way,"The VOICE is back after only a year with another clear winner. Her voice may be a gift from above but she maximizes it to absolute perfection.In the spirit of the finest who ever trod the boards, the interpretations on this CD is destined to become a Broadway classic for generations to come. Listening to this collection of Broadway classics transport you to another time, when life appeared simpler and more meaningful.Linda never fails to put her best voice into her efforts, but how much better can it get? Well, Broadway, My Way amply demonstrates that we've seen nothing yet! Each time you think she can't possible get any better, she does!Without a doubt, the synergy of this miraculous collection, heavenly executed and imaginatively arranged so as to delight your ears, deeply touch the core of your heart and imbed itself into your very soul.I can't wait to hear this collection live, since as marvelous as Linda is in the studio, she absolutely soars when live!"
1,"Great singer, lousy engineering","I love Linda Eder, but on this CD she is hidden behind the orchestra. I tried it on several machines. I even used an equalizer to help bring out her voice. What a waste of money. And, hey! what a waste of Linda!!!"
1,All Repeats Bad Versions,"This album is either repeats of earlier songs on Eder albums, or copy cat arrangements of Barbra and Liza songs. Although Eder has a voice, she has no style of her own at all. I am amazed that after all of these years, she never seems to create anything of her own. She seems to always be copying everyone else, and then gets angry when interviewers bring it up. If she doesn't want to be known as a ""wanna-be"" Barbra, then why in the world does she keep trying to copy her? From her web site, to her recordings, to her on stage concerts - she is copying Barbras marketing strategy to a T. Eder needs to find her own style and go after it. Until then, spare us of these remakes ofalready immortalized songs and remakes of old Eder ones. Eder fans deserve NEW STUFF!!!!!"
1,"Gold Didn't Shine, Neither Does This","This Album is not Linda Eder's best. Her first 3 albums were much better. Eder's voice is as tired and worn sounding as the material that she recorded. Broadway fans will be disappointedwith this new effort at old standards. The new Broadway is fresh with ideas from Elton John, Disney etc. This recording reflects the old ideology which is wearing out in this new era.It's likelistening to old recordings from the forties. The new Broadwaycrowd wants something fresh and vibrant. I hope Linda Eder findsa new writer and producer to mold her next album. The ones shehas now are living in the past."
5,"Broadway, My Way is Amazing!","I have every one of Linda Eder's CD's and Broadway, My Way is a must-have. She belts out the notes like it's nothing. I would definitely recomend this CD to any Linda Eder fan, or any Broadway fan."
4,Even more powerful voice on this album,"'THIS' is apparently my favorite Linda Eder album. She sounds stronger than before and her high notes are even more supported. Although Barbra Streisand is my #1 favorite singer, I try not to compare Linda to Barbra or Barbra to Linda. Barbra once made 'Classical Barbra', claiming that she did those Classical songs her way. And this is Linda's BROADWAY MY WAY.' She chose to sing those songs in her OWN acrobatic way, which I admit that I like very much. The only disappointment is that she didn't feature all new songs: just 9 new ones and 4 from her previous albums. Some might say that LINDA shows off her capability of holding high notes very, very long. But I like it. For people who are hesitating whether to buy this album or not, I want to tell you that if you like the kind of big songs that we have heard Barbra Streisand sing, you might like this album. Linda sings those big songs in her FULLY-SUPPORTED voice, not the so-called falsetto."
1,Broadway better NOT be Her Way,"Please tell me that I wasn't transported back to a lounge in the 1970s. Linda Eders attempt at copying Liza, Barbra, and whoever else fails miserably. This is a singer that sounds like any small town lounge singer in any part of the country. The album gives new credence to the belief that Broadway is truly suffering from a lack of talent these days. Hopefully, she can act, because she surely can't sing, unless you call screaming one tone, singing.Disappointing arrangements, Nothing new, Outdated songs thataren't relevant in the new millennium on Broadway or anywhere else on the planet. I bought the album out of curiosity,because of all the hype. Well, that's what it was. Hype.Eder has a thin voice, poor diction,( can't understand any of the lyrics), and blows through every ending with lung power, but no tone and no musical finesse. Leave the album on the Rack. Atlantic should find some decent talent. Lounge singers like this should stay in the bars."
3,I hate repeats,"I loved 50% of this new album, I am a huge Linda Eder fan and have seen her live numerous times. I own all her CD's and DVD. My one issue is that half of this album can be heard on other of her albums. Man of La Mancha, Unusually Way, A New Life, Gold can all be heard on other CD's , there is nothing added to these new songs to make them stand out. There are so many other shows and other songs, I sometimes think Linda just got lazy and recorded a handful of new songs and then cut and paste some old songs onto this new album. If I want to hear an incredible version of Gold I can just pop in my gold album. Linda dont be so lazy."
4,Linda can sing Broadway!,I was pleased (and surprised) to see Linda with another CD [...]Just the same... Linda is a great concert performer and though I love her voice I have found her dramatic performances bland and uninspired. But this CD again shows that she has a Broadway voice... [...] Oh... regarding the CD...I was struck particularly by her take on the song from Nine.
5,"Her voice, Her way!","This new release by the incomparable Linda Eder is an easy listener's joy! Her voice is pure perfection in how it wraps itself around each note and displays so many nuances.......the highlights on this album are EDELWEISS, A NEW LIFE, WHAT FOOL AM I, DON'T RAIN ON MY PARADE, THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM, MAN OF LA MANCHA and GOLD....my only minor complaints are 1) I wish there had been a few more uptempo numbers included and 2) I wish she had performed this cd with a live orchestra and not a studio one.......other than this, it is a pure joy as always to have the great LINDA BACK AT HER GAME! *After more listens, I changed my review to 5 stars....it lacks nothing!!!!!!!* What the slow songs and studio orchestra bring are serenity and peace and in today's world we need it! Thank you Linda!!!!*"
3,Some tracks are better than others,"This CD is a mixed bag. Some of her renditions are superb, especially those of ""I'll be Seeing You"" an ""In a Very Unusual Way"" from Nine. However, do we really need to hear ""Gold"" again> (if this is the best song in Camille Claudel, we're in trouble). or ""A New Life"" from Jekyll & Hyde. Some tracks are mediocre and were better in the original. I think a live album should be the next step for Ms. Eder as you cannot hear the magic of her live performances on this studio-recorded CD."
3,Typical Clancy,"Very dry, almost boring. Typical Clancy writing. I realize it is not a novel but I have read other books on SF and they are much more interesting although not as in depth as Clancy's. This book is a little outdated now. You can probably find more up to date information on SF."
4,Timely and informative,"Right now, as the air campaign in Afghanistan nears completion, there is little doubt that these are the folks who will be hitting the ground,(they may in fact already be there). This book gives a good overview of how these forces are organized and how they operate. I found it very enlightening as we enter this new era of warfare."
2,Clancy's,"Unfortunely, I waited too long to buy this book. It is way out of date and the information is irrelevant."
3,Maybe not even three-star material,"I feel pretty certain Gresham is the one writing these books, not Clancy. Not only is Gresham given all the photo credits, but in one instance, a story is related where one of the SF soldiers calls Gresham by name and Clancy is not mentioned. Also, a photograph of SF soldier doodles draws a caricature of Gresham and again Clancy is not mentioned. Also, the ""mini-novel"" that concludes the novel is weaker than weak. There is still some good information here, but it is deeply buried in minutia. The only reason I gave it three stars is that the photos are marginally better than some others in this series."
2,Not all that good,"This is another of the series of books (e.g. the Op Center series) in which Clancy adds his name to something largely written by somebody else. Whatever his faults as a stylist (and I like his work when its actually his), Clancy knows how to write in an interesting way. This has not rubbed off on his co-conspiritors. No insult to Mr. Gresham (the actual author of most of the book) who is apparently just doing as he was told, but this book adds nothing to the already considerable number of titles on special operations. Its treatment of the topic is often superficial and the writing is no better than pedestrian. If you know absoloutely nothing about US Special Forces this book might be an OK place to start but otherwise I'd look for another of the many treatments of the subject."
2,Summary of Other Books,"This book seems more like a concantenation of other books. With the exception of the interview and the organization outline, the book's contents are summaries of other books on SF. If one wants in depth coverage they should get Simmons', Waller's, and/or the Power Series' books on SF. Another problem with this book is that it is often more of a list rather than discussion or narration. Many of one paragraph summaries exists and are highly insufficient. Lastly, it talks way too much about SF's parent organizations such as SOCOM and Army SOC rather than SF itself, with the added over-praising already metioned by other reviewers. You won't gain much knowledge of SF through this book."
5,Long overdue for a Region 1 DVD set,"Just a quickie to echo everyone else. This series was one of the best written SF television shows ever, easily one of the ten best SF shows of all time. Low budget, but still light years ahead of most of its contemporaries and imitators. Its just a shame that the BBC doesn't seem to agree, since they've never appeared interested in releasing a Region 1 DVD release.Here's hoping they change their minds."
3,"Look, I want people to like this as much as the next guy...","...but I want them to like it for the right reason.I really like this show. Release it region 1 & I will buy it.But....it is a *bad* show. Sometimes, that makes it really, really, funny. Sometimes it makes it cool in a 'cheaper than dr. who' kind of way. But sometimes, it just means it's dull. It's worth it--the payoffs are regular, and amusing on one level or the other--but it is not for everyone, I don't think it's unrealistic to say it's not for most people....but if you liked Space Cops, or The Prisoner, or Dark Star, or Space 1999 or ST:TOS...there's a good chance you'll like this.It's better than V or Jason of Star Command or Battlestar Galactica (TOS), no lie."
5,I Agree!! Please release this in Region 1!,"Why have multiple sets been released in other region codes but not in what could be its biggest market, Region 1?"
3,Good product,"CD/DVD are OK but the DVD is only a compilation of a few moments on the Mamma Mia, I expected the complete DVD from the actual performance.I'm rather disappointed."
1,mama mia,"I am very dissapointed in the quality of this product as it skips in some places, we tried different players with no change. I was also mislead on the dvd which I assumed was the complete show.Howard Kool"
5,This is a MUST HAVE,"We bought this along with the movie soundtrack. It is outstanding. We could sing along with the lyrics, the casts and musicians were listed. I was even able to use an insert to find ringtones for the cellular phone. The quality of both the CD and DVD were excellant with no interruptions, misses,skips or any of those pesky disruptions. The collectors jewel case was nicely laid out and we will cherish it for a long time."
5,Great CD/DVD Combo,"Not only is this a GREAT CD, but it was also fun to watch the DVD to see the action behind the scenes, etc."
1,omg,"I was soooooooo disappointed when I open the pacage. Guess what. It was supposed to include both DVD and cD in it, but i've only got one- the DVD one!!!!!. and that dvd was only a bonus edition for CD. I mean, who would spend more than $20 on the back stage story? this is the worst experience i've ever had on online shopping !!!!!!"
1,bad recording,The recording is my second attempt to purchase this selection. There are several places where the speed is off and the music is bad. I tried it on other players just to make sure it was not the player.
2,Not good as visible but OK,"My wife purchase these ear ball but she seems to be not et all happy, price are good but designs are not satisfactory when these are in your hand. May be big in size and hollow."
1,Wouldn't take a charge,"Received it, put it on the charger and it wouldn't take a charge so I sent it back."
3,One Flaw,The only complaint I have about this 2 hole puncher is that it punches to close to the edge of the paper. It does not leave enough space between the hole and the edge of the paper so it easily rips making it impossible to keep papers secure in our files.
1,Why doesn't it come with TWO pens???,"My daughter LOVES this book. However, the pen only lasts about half the book... so I bought a second one, hoping we just got a dud. Nope! Neither pen lasted. I wouldn't purchase this item."
1,"Seriously, it needs another pen.","Maybe you should just buy two and toss one of the books away? My 2 year old does LOVE this book, but the marker is already drying up and she's not even half way thru. I came on here hoping to be able to buy more pens without the book, but I guess they don't sell them that way. Too bad, because it really turned me off to the entire product. (because I just hate waste, but there's not enough marker for the books!)"
5,New and Fresh,"Congratulations, this is a remarkable Debut-CD by pianist and composer Sebastian Schunke, using some of the finest Latin-Jazz Musicians (John Benitez, antonio Sanchez, Dafnis Prieto, Richie Flores) His musical concept of combining traditional Afro-Carrebean Rhythms and European music elements is convincing and incredible beautiful, keep on Sebastian with your unique Symbiosis"
1,FULL OF SILVERSKIN,"should be named Golden Valley Natural Beef Silverskin, Teriyaki Flavored. unchewables in almost every bite. flavor too sweet and also has an unpleasant aftertaste. butcher who cut this meat up didn't care what YOU ate."
2,Too Sweet!,"This beef jerky is too sweet and not much taste at all, it just taste funny not like the traditional beef jerky. Will not buy this again."
3,Thoughts About this Cookbook,"I purchased this book to expand my reportoire of healthy recipes because quinoa is such a great grain for lowfat diets.As a vegan I appreciate all this grain has to offer: protein, thiamin, iron, etc. Unfortunately, Ms. Kijac includes extra butter, oils, and meats to cook quinoa in most of her recipes. If you are vegan, this book is definitely not for you because it includes dairy in over half the recipes - unless,of course, you are comfortable with making non-dairy substitutions.Out of the 27 recipes I found 3 I could use directly from the book."
1,The Art of Cooking with Quinoa: A Complete Vegetable Protein,The recipes in this book aren't great and many of them call for use with animal proteins. I have found many delicious recipes for quinoa in vegan cookbooks.
1,Really ZERO Stars,"This book might be a great travel guide for the worst BBQ in Texas, but its' authors certainly never made it to any REAL BBQ on their ""adventures."" These big name restaurants are famous for making middle of the road BBQ meant to offend no-one and ultimately they offer no real food - just filler. It's like trying to figure out what great BBQ is by touring France."
4,This was a gift,This book was a gift for someone that wanted recipes of Texas BBQ. I looked through it before gifting and enjoyed the recipes.
3,good deal for all of the movies,"not a bad deal for all the mirror movies, although the last couple were not as well made or entertaining"
2,worth it for the first mirror mirror,the only reason to get this box set if for the original mirror mirror. mirror mirror is a cool film that many people dont know about. creepy at times and a interesting story line make it worth while. the other three movies are boring but worth a look... i guess.
4,Buyer Beware,"BUYER BEWARE. This is the same DVD as their original ""You Make Me Feel Like Dancing"" they released in 2008. The packaging is just different. This movie is great and my kids love it. Now we have two copies, I guess, because I opened and played it before realizing they're identical. Oh well. Hopefully this will help someone else."
3,bird songs,"I just received this CD and it's just okay. The bird sounds are a little harsh and shrill for my liking. If you want an exceptional bird-song CD, buy 'Bird Songs of the Northwoods' instead. See my review of that CD for details."
5,THE BEST BOOK! IM AN 3-D FILM ANIMATOR AND ITS GREAT!,"absolutley a MUST have for animators of all ages...it has helped tremendously, i also recomend the encyclopedia of animation which is also a great influence on me as an animator!peace! mike"
1,We need more...,"... and better! This book has presented itself as the answer for the lack of books about stop-motion animation. It is sad that by doing that it has killed the oportunity for any others to appear about this subject. Also, I am an animation student, so for me this book should be like a bible, unfortunately, it is too superficial."
3,one touch record faulty,"I have used this product to play around with taping a few shows off the air. I had to directly connect the hdtv to the recorder, because I don't think the recorder scans for digital channels(no built-in hd tuner). This is fine, but makes for a tough time when trying to set the timer record, which is the only fool-proof way to record past 30 min. I've had to sit by the machine a few times while recording to make sure it wouldn't stop at 30 min. Still not sure because I manually press record??? I guess I need to press it a few times to add 30 min slots... I know this is the one-touch recording feature, but I wish there was a message or indicator that recording was going to stop after 30 min. Otherwise a nice little machine to start with especially for the price. I paid $70."
1,Hard unit to work with!,"The Presidian DVD recorder is not the best piece of equipment.One. The instructions on operating it, are written very poorly.(The set-up menu can be somewhat confusing.)Two. You can't record from tv, without having a seperate wall input from your cable service. (you can't put the unit throughyour cable box without losing some of your cable channels!)It took me two days to figure out how to record from my vcr.and if you want to record from a dvd player, you have to disconnect the out puts from the vcr and re-route them to the dvd player.The only thing I can recomend is that you use this unit as a temporary piece of equipment. Until you can step up to a betterone."
4,Excellent tips,"Old school, but still relevant and useful in today digital world! Very innovate and creative techniques, gives details on how to reproduce results."
1,Sucks,Mudvayne is way better then this band ever will be. I dont even know why I bought this cd but it really sucked.
5,Most medolic metal IVE EVER HEARD!,I first heard of GRADE 8 when ozzfest bands were announced they are on the 2nd stage then.I got to go to my first concert I got to see MUDVAYNE with GRADE 8 and They are the GReatest live band ive ever seen .No ON CAN SCREAM AS HARD AS RYAN IVE EVER HEARD but im hoping thell get more promoted.I havent listened to the whole album but my favorite I THINK is One Wish And Adrenachrome And i love BRick by Brick.
1,THESE GUYS DO NOT HAVE A CHANCE,to the editorial review what are you thinking saying theseguys are better than opeth thats ignorant let alone the other bands you mentioned suck to but not as much as these guys
2,WTF?!?!,"Okay, I don't even have this, but I've heard the samples and it pretty much sounds just like another proof why nu-metal sucks. But look at the editorial review for a sec.....""Hardcore rockers Grade 8 are ready to give Mudvayne, Saliva & Opeth a run for their money.""I'm sorry, but how can you compare mallcore cr a ppy bands like Mudvayne and Saliva to the almighty Opeth (an original metal band that you've never heard on MTV or the radio and that never sold out)? And to give Opeth a run for their money?!! You crazy ************! The song 'Black Rose Immortal' alone blows away Mudvayne's whole discography, as well as with Saliva's (and quite possibly also with G8). It's not even funny.Want something good? Get Opeth's 'Morning Rise' or 'Deliverance'. They will kil any nu-metal album you can think of."
3,Nothing special. Okay... not great.,I first heard about these guys when Ozzfest was announced. I bought all Ozzfest 03 CD's used. I put this on and heard a cool opening riff. The guys voice reminded me of Ryan from Soil. I thought it was cool but then I heard the rap. (hed)PE and Linkin Park are the only bands that should rap.The only really good track is Smoke and Mirrors. Download if you must have all Ozzfest 03 bands but don't waste your money.
1,Grade Zero,This cd is pathetic. The music is really boring and the singers voice is terrible. Unfortunately I saw this band live recently and they sounded even worse than the cd. Don't waste your time or money.
2,HAHAHAHAAHA OPETH?!?!? HAHAHAHA,"ok.... i don't even own this CD. But i mean... just LOOK at the Editorial review... there is SOOO MUCH wrong with those statements it's not even funny. Mudvayne, Opeth, Saliva, and Grade 8 mentioned in the same sentence... HAHAHAHAA holy moses i think i just had a poo nugget soil my undies. ahh it was just a turtle head i pulled it back in.Seriously though, Opeth has the kind of depth and maturity that no band in nu metal EVER has or EVER will... it's completely insane to compare any nu metal to Opeth, let alone say it gives them a run for their money! I listened to the samples and this is pretty much typical nu metal... gives Opeth a run for their money... HAHAHA oh my god that's about the funniest thing i've read on amazon. In an editorial review no less! HAHAHA now if you'll excuse me i have to get rid of this walnut in my pant'loons."
1,not very impressive,"i bought this cd after hearing brick by brick and i was hooked. got the cd and was pissed as hell. too much rap not enough rock. i also despise rap but still i dont recomend buying this cd. it had ok riffs in alot of their songs but saturated in rappy lyrics, this ruined it for me. i ended up selling it for 10.00 bucks to a friend becuase he liked it. if you like hard rock metal nu metal, dont go for this.rap is crap."
2,their not from la,"first of all these guys are ok , but they are from lansing michigan not L.A. BASED"
4,Is that Ryan McCombs?,"No. It's Ryan Tooker, the voice for Grade 8. These guys sound much like Soil thru-out the first and last half of the cd, with the exception that the lyrics are spoken quicker. A few of the bass lines have the punchiness of Soil's and Tooker also possesses the ability to alter his voice to suit the mood and music. A pretty good nu-metal (if that term means squat) release. You should consider it."
5,pretty awesome,"now, before the actual review, i just wanna say sumthin about the thingy up top, i think if grade 8 hits the mainstream radio (whitch i do not care for that much anymore) they should kill saliva, and with a little work also mudvayne, but don't freakin say they will give OPETH a run for their money, cuz that bull. like this one other guy said before, opeth has the maturaty that no other nu metal band has.Now, to talk about the cd. Personally i like it, yes i knoe its nu metal, (really, i HATE most nu metal like korn and lb) but for a nu metal band, and this is from a guy who listens to machine head, killswitch, 36 crazyfist etc, they are pretty good. i suggests you try them out, and if u like nu metal, definity go for them, but as for me, ill be listenin to more of machine head, but this will be in my collection"
1,Nice Try With The Threat To Opeth and Mudvayne,"""Hardcore rockers Grade 8 are ready to give Mudvayne, Saliva & Opeth a run for their money.""That's what's under the ""product description"" above. It's right under the song samples.First off, you can't scare off Mudvayne. True, you may consider Mudvayne nu metal, but not ordinary nu-metal, especially on ""L.D. 50"", as it blends in elements of prog and technical music as well. Comparing this cookie-cutter disc to a fine CD is blasphemy.However, it is not as blasphemous as it is to Opeth! I mean, come on, can you actually compare a band who writes epic memorable songs to some lame nu-metal band that only released two forgettable albums?Seriously, this CD is no good. Nothing special, memorable, and it's boring. If you want a good nu-metal CD, check into Deftones, 40 Below Summer, Ill Nino, OLD Mudvayne or Sevendust. And for the love of Sweet Mary, don't think that they'll pass up Opeth."
4,Decent Quality For The Price,"These are not burner covers that will survive the apocalypse, but they are good for decoratively covering your burners (and in my case, keeping the pet hair out of them from when my cats climb around on the stove when I'm gone). I like the style and the two available sizes that come in each pack."
4,Cover up,"Not as colorful as I would like, but they match the color of my stove perfectly and cover up a multitude of sins. They really look great."
2,Premature technology development for Creative on Skype phone,"For this CREATVE internet DECT phone,it has very impressive quality on voice clarityBut not only the batteries were designed not able to hold power more than 24 hrs on standby, the phone itself was poorly designed on battery capacity. It simply won't hold power, but such problem is easily understood since the phone is expected to be operational on merely two aaa batteris.Big dissapointment."
1,Too Hard!,The game is extremely hard. I was expecting it to be on the level of the Jeff Foxworthy Bible game show but it is no where near that. I am 58 and have taught adult sunday school classes for years. I was stumped.
3,Check Amazon's Track Listing!!,"There is only one review so far that is what Amazon.com is actually going to send you. This is not the album you will find as the re-release of 'Ray Charles' as 'Hallelujah I Love Her So!' if you look it up on Wikipedia. This is not the singles compilation that had the early singles such as 'I Got A Woman', 'Drown in My Own Tears' or even 'Hallelujah I Love Her So!'!! I actually can't find this album anywhere online - the only mention of this actual release is the review below that claims it to be Ray's first real album.I'm not sure though - I just read Ray's discography on HIS website and Wikipedia and these songs seem to be a compilation from other albums.That being said all the music is good, I mean its Ray Charles, I just don't know what this is...there are no liner notes."
3,Jessica stands out.,I also thought Jessica was the strongest on the CD.It was fun hearing a variety of older tunes. I found Jessicas website...Jessicaharp.net for those of you trying to locate her music.
2,Music critic in the making,"I read the other two reviews on this soundtrack and had to agree with them. I also wondered who this Jessica Harp is? I can't find anything on her, but I did like her sound and the cover of kinks during the credits of the film. Speak up if you know something I don't."
1,Awful,"I read someone's review mentioning that The Fiend in Human Form ""out-aliens The Alienist."" Wow. Therefore, I quickly purchased this book. Sadly, I feel swindled. This book is not only a complete bore, but the author simply does not even come close to the likes of Caleb Carr or Michael Cox. When I see ""judgment"" spelled with an 'e,' it becomes readily apparent that the author and his editors are quacks. Pathetic. I want my money back. It seems as if the reviews on Amazon were written by the author's friends and family. Stay away."
3,Hunter,"The humidifier gets progressively louder, the older it gets. After one season, the unit started leaking onto our hardwood floor making it necessary to buy a new humidifier. Would not recommend if fan noise bothers you or there is concern about leaking onto hardwood floors."
3,I like it BUT,"As others have noted it gets noisy. I found the cause and a quick fix, the cause is the pump - the round white section. Let the water drain, turn the motor housing over and move the impeller stem gently back and forth (it doesn't move much) - the noise goes away for several days. Hunter should change the design. (if amazon chooses to delete this they should at the very least notify Hunter of the problem)The BUT - the advertisement says parts are dishwasher safe - EASY CARE, the instruction book says to soak them in vinegar. I also thought I was buying a model with a humidistat."
5,Great Little Item,"I have been using Hunter humidifiers exclusively now for a number of years and have never had a problem ... this one being no exception. One of the 'luxuries' of these Hunter humidifiers is they truly are CAREFREE - no changing of wicks necessary - just a quick cleaning a couple times a season, before the 'final', more thorough vinegar cleaning before putting it away for storage until the next dry winter months. This is a great little machine - very quiet and effective. The night-glow feature adds a gentle blue glow in the room - very serene. The unit continuously produces cool mist for approximately 24 hours before needing to be refilled. And, of course, as customary with Amazon - this product was delivered much earlier than originally anticipated."
2,Disapointed,"Disapointed with this Hunter humidifier and its short working time. After 2 months of use, the humidifier stopped working and smelled bad. After checking it out, we found that the unit had gotten too hot and the smell was hot plastic. Would not come back on. The wick/filter was a mess to deal with. After contacting Hunter for a replacement, they gave us to many hoops to jump through to make it worth our while to send it back. So we trashed it. We won't buy another one by Hunter. We had heard Hunter was supposed to be one of the best."
2,Does not run well,I purchased this humidifier in hopes that it would humidify my home without having to clean the unit frequently. The filter and water source are constantly needing to be cleaned and the unit runs quite loudly.
1,Cool doesn't cut it?,"I bought two 33251 humdifiers, and they couldn't replace a single, smaller Kenmore unit in terms of raising the humidity in my home. The difference -- and problem -- seems to be that the 33251 produces cool air. By comparison, the Kenmore and many other models produce steam, which does a much better, faster job of humidifying. After owning the 33251s for more than a year, I'd strongly recommend looking at models from Hunter or other vendors that use the steam approach. Plus, in winter, who really wants a machine producing a steady stream of cool air?"
1,WHY CANT YOU GET IT THEN?,"typical....it suddenly becomes 'unavailable'...sounds like someone is up to their stupid grade school antics.....hell no i aint spending 130.00 bucks for this. how stupid, more powere to you if you did"
5,Expensive but Worth IT post Bunionectomy,"Purchased along with an 8"" leg pillow. It has been great. I took a long time given the price but delighted with result. As the other reviews say, it is very sturdy, has a long under-materess support for stability, and can take any weight of duvet/blanket. Provides an ample space for the feet and is fairly easy to work around when changing dressings/applying ice bags/etc.With the wife's double bunionectomy, the last thing I wanted was a foot tent that might not do the job. This tent has been great."
1,Made my own,It is a nice design but too expensive. I made the same thing from a 1/2 inch ten foot length of PVC pipe and eight elbows from Lowes for less than $10. Cut six 12 inch sections from the ten pipe. Then cut the remaining 4 ft section in half. Assemble in the same shape as this item with the two foot pieces being the vertical sections. I cut off 4 inches from the two ft pieces to fit my bed. No need to glue them together. Works perfectly.
1,DO NOT RECOMMEND,"volume control is poor, & hearing dificult as headset picks up outside noise. Would not recommend."
2,Nice idea in principle,"As an airline pilot, I loved the idea of this little kit, since I need to grab sleep whenever and where ever I can get it. The CD didn't have that 'lulling to sleep' effect for me at all (that's just me, though). The balm seemed a bit gimmick-y to me, as well. You really could easily create your own kit by picking up some earplugs, a sleep mask and making your own CD.Hope it worked better for someone else out there!"
3,good tracks from a great band but.....,"Semisonic fans and non-fans that find this album won't be dissappointed with the tracks they find. The problem with buying this album is that you miss out on the other fantastic work that Semisonic did. And since their musical library is relatively small compared to some other artists, why not spend a few more bucks and buy all of Semisonic's albums.In chronological order, they are Pleasure-EP, Great Divide, Feeling Strangely Fine, and All About Chemistry. While you're at it, grab Dan Wilson's Free Life. It's equally fantastic."
4,Solid effort,"This band is incredible, not only because of this very commendable debut but also for the fact that the whole band has barely graduated from high school. ELements of Kurt Cobain (Nivana singer) and Lifehouse (instrumentals) can be found here; it seems the band cannot decide between the Melodic Rock approach, or the grunge, hard rock tact.Killer songs include ""Never be the same"", ""Utopia"" (sound like they ripped it straight from Nirvana's CD), ""Everyone"", and ""I""m Happy"". However, the album generally carries an optimistic mood, with some very catchy melodic passages.If you're a fan of staind, thornley, or anything that incorporates talented vocalists and modest ""heaviness"", then you'll no doubt enjoy this up and coming band."
5,I LOVE THESE GUYS!!!!!,Socialburn is the greatest band of the year and there CD Where You Are is the best CD that I have heard in a while. I first saw these guys live in Toledo with Seether and we were so excited to see Seether but when we sae Socialburn play thats all we could talk about for the next week. This CD is A must have it is awesome.
4,Socialburn,"This is one of those bands where you hear a song on the radio and go, damn who was that!? I heard their first single ""Down"" on my local rock station and man was i impressed. This band sounds nothing like the other who express no talent. The cd is solid. I think some of the key tracks are ""Down"", ""Everyone"", and ""Never be the same"", just to name a few. I think this band will explode, just wait.(Anyone who resembles Kurt Cobain or Gavin Rossdale must be worthy)"
2,Anyone ever hear of FUEL?,"This album aint terrible, but it's nothing special...and the singer is a Bret Scalions...The best song ive heard by them is called ""beautiful"" and it's not even on the album."
2,"2 good songs, that's it","well, i first saw these guys live when they opened for Ra and Seether (both incredible bands) the only reason that I bought socialburn's cd when it was released was because of Utopia, in which the bass play takes over lead vocals for the chorus, and he simply kicks ass. the other good song on this cd is Down, where, even though the vocalist sounds like a Kurt Cobain rehash, is still a pretty good, catchy song. The rest of the album is pretty lame, though, can't lie. The Bassist should either permanently take over lead vocals, or leave this wannabe gurnge band and start something great on his own."
2,...Sketchy!,"When I first heard Socialburn's breakout single on a late night radio progrm, I fell in love with it. I thought they kinda sounded like a hybrid between Puddle of Mudd and Fuel. Well I rushed out and bought the cd the day it came out for a light 10 bucks. Let me tell you...I was thoroughly disappointed. They try too hard to blend together their influences and come out sounding like a jumble of average. Their lead singer is a complete Brett Scallions Rip-Off (Fuel). Check out Bush, Fuel, or Puddle of Mudd before you even think about buying Socialburn's Where You Are. Despite the afforementioned Down, there are a FEW amazing songs on the Cd. The Opener, Break Back, is an incredible song, Sizzling Vocals and a nice guitar riff. Utopia, a long intense power ballad is also amazing. Pretend harkens back to Nirvana's ""Bleach Era"". But 4 incredible songs aren't worth 10 dollars. There is better stuff out there"
4,Pleasently surprised,"When I first listened to ""Down"" (their first big single that I know of) I thought it was pretty good, but I was expecting them to be more of a one hit wonder sort of band. I don't know why, mabey because of all the other new bands that had one ""Great Song"" and then no one ever heard of them again. As the title implies, I was very pleased with this CD. ""Down"" dosen't do this band credit. Every song on this album has SOMETHING good about it. And some just plain rock altogether (""Ashes"" comes to mind). This CD is easily worth your hard earned $$$."
1,SOCIALBURN!!!!!,"Social who???? O well socialburn is alright, if you happen to be living on another planet. and yes they are horrible but i still bought the cd because i love to listen to really bad bands"
5,Amazing,"Like many other people who bought Socialburn's CD ""Where you are,"" I had only heard ""Down"" and ""Everyone."" Having loved both of these songs, I bought the CD and was in awe of its greatness. Every song has special meaning to it, and i can relate to many of them. I would have to say that my favorite song is ""stacy,"" the last song, because it's so different. I would recommend this CD to anyone who enjoys good music."
5,"socialburn rocks, the guys are super sweet","i first got into socialburn after seeing them back in february, they had an awesome stage presence, and i got their cd the next day. i love all of the songs, and that is very rare with a cd, to like all the songs, plus they write all their own lyrics and music. all of the songs are clean lyrics, some songs are softer and some a little heavier, but i think everyone could benefit adding this cd to their collection!"
5,Works great,This nifty little mat is great for helping you cool off on hot summer days. (My bare feet are on it right now.) You don't need to refrigerate it (I never have) or soak it in water like other cushions. Just touching it with your warm skin activates the gel inside and it feels cool. The effect lasts for hours and you can always turn it over. This handy vinyl mat is always ready to use and requires no maintenance. Highly recommended for a little relief when you need it.
4,Excellent Cooling Cushion,"Of the three I've had this is the best cooling cushion so far.1. It doesn't get big, lumpy, hard chunks when it re-crystalizes2. Cooling lasts all night3. Cover doesn't stick to skin too badly. (This is always going to be a compromise between heat transfer-ability and skin feel.)4. Edges aren't too sharp, as long as it doesn't get bunched up it's OK.5. Filling has to occasionally be redistributed to prevent thin and thick areas.Review Update (July 2012)It's starting to develop bigger, hard chunks when it recrystalizes after a few months of regular use. But it's still much better than any other cooling cushion I've used."
3,Hard as a rock,It stays cold however the crystals inside are hard and instead of being grooved which makes it bumpy it should be a smooth surface. Not a comfortable surface for your head.
4,Stays cool and keeps me cool,I'm not going to write much of a review on this. I've been laying on it for an hour and it is still very cool. So good for me who gets pretty hot without air conditioning. I cannot wait to take this to bed.What I wanted to say is this price of $39.99 is outrageous. I just got one in gray for $24.95 including shipping (this thing is really heavy) from [...] and there are other places for about the same price.Let me tell you about the manufacturers customer service. There were some odd marks on mine. it looked like there had been some tape on it then set out in the sun. I sent an email to the seller and cc'd the manufacturer with photos so they could see. Within an hour the manufacturer had my address and is shipping a N/C replacement out AND I can keep the original. Very happy with the service (did not hear from the seller).I need a blanket out of this. So for sure worth the $25. QVC has it for about $32 with shipping in a bunch of colors.
2,"Hard as a rock, only mildly cool at room temp","The pictures show someone resting their head on this. NOT! It IS indeed hard as a rock, and would be very uncomfortable, even for the back. I am wondering if the other reviews for this product are fakes. I've kept the one I ordered,but only use it for cooling my feet, which heat up at night in bed and prevent my going to sleep. For this, it works just okay, although I do place it in the freezer to get extra cold. Leaving out at room temperature during the day, it cools off, but doesn't stay cool long."
3,DOES NOT MEET MY NEEDS,The product does not meet my needs. The cold temperature does not last very long. Constantly replacing in fridge to allow internal material to become stiff to provide cool touch.
5,Suivez La Piste,This is an excellent book for those who are at an intermediate level of FRENCH. It holds your interest (it's a mystery book) while you learn!
2,mostly practice tests,This gives a sketchy review of major topics with a lot of practice tests. Cliff's gives a more extensive detailed review and Princeton gives a good last minute overview of major points. The only redeeming quality is it is a source for questions when I write an AP Bio test for my class.Ed Thompson AP Bio teacher (8 yrs.)
1,So inaccurate!,"I bought this book from Amazon - geez I wish I looked at it in a bookstore first! I can't believe how many inaccuracies were in this one - from general operating system stuff to the actual tutorials. So many were incomplete or just didn't make sense, all through the book. I really have no clue what these other people are getting at about how great it was. I read these reviews and thought it would be a wonderful book, but I was sadly misinformed."
1,Only buy it if it's required,"Ya know, I'm up to chapter 5 in my class that uses this book, and it hasn't taught me anything that I couldn't have learned on my own via online flash tutorials. Sure, it may have required me getting on google and searching (god forbid), but come on.I can only recommend this if you need it for a class, and even so, you can probably find it on an auction site. $40 is too much IMO, and considering it only comes with a 30-day trial of the program (which I'm sure you can get elsewhere for free), it's plain not worth it considering you can find it elsewhere. Buy the student version of the program and find the book on an auction site."
5,GREAT Way to Learn Flash,"Over the last two years, I've purchased a few Flash books in the hopes of learning the tool and spicing up my website. For some reason, the materials never delivered on their promises and I ended up going with SwishMax in a pinch. This book does a GREAT job in teaching the materials...much better than I've experienced in the past. Now that I'm comfortable with Flash, I've put SwishMax back on the shelf.BTW, I'm an IT project manager with 30 years experience and I just turned 60...never stop learning."
5,Comprehensive and eloquently written,"Never before have I encountered such an eloquently written book that takes the complex intertwining web of design and programming and amalgamated them so fluidly into something that is not only intellectually digestable but delightfully savoring. If you are a novice or a guru, Rosanna Yeung has created a powerful new weapon that empowers you to revolutionize the web space with new innovations that combine design, animation and programming. In the tradition of the Lynda Weinmann Hand's on training series, this book can serve as the best alternative to an actual instructional classroom minus the drive time and limited pace. As E.B. White and Strunk's Elements of Style was to grammer and writting, Rosanna Yeung's H.O.T. Macromedia Flash MX 2004 is to web design."
4,A helpful in instruction manual,"I am currently taking classes on graphic design, and was instructed that this would be a helpful manual in helping to learn how to use the flash animation system. I was instructed that this is the best manual out there."
1,Do Not Purchase,"I am completely new to Flash and I only purchased the book because it was recommended by an instructor. I hated each exercise since it started with an already created file. Every exercise should begin with ""open a new file"" and not one that contains at least half of the exercise requirements already completed. I wasted a lot of time trying to recreate what the author required only to discover that she eliminated some very simple but essential mouse clicks. A bulleted list of instructions would be a much better presentation of the instructions because of the many steps in each exercise.I know that there are other published books that will teach the beginner much much better than this one will."
4,Another helpful reference from Peachpit,"Being in the media business, I've had the opportunity to use a myriad of software manuals and references. I have always found Peachpit Press offers clear, concise guides that bring you up to speed fast. Flash MX 2004 Hands-On Training is no exception. The only reason this book didn't get a five-star rating is because I love lots of free extras when the manual comes with a companion CD and this one came up lighter than I would have liked."
4,A concise and competent guide.,"Frommers guide to Scandanavia was of great help to me on a trip to Denmark. I wanted to stay in Copenhagen, visit Elsinore, the Vikingship museam at Roskilde, see the sights in Copenhagen itself etc. I didn't get lost, I made all my journeys by train, I found good value clean accomodation with great breakfasts. I was able to find reasonable restaurants with excellent food on offer, and all of it came out of the Frommers guide. I got advice I needed on issues such as tipping, and I got explanations for what the food on the menu's was, and what was good to eat in Denmark. All in all I found this to be an excellent guide and I would heartily recommend both Frommers and Denmark to any traveller. Skol!"
3,Seemingly good book--but where's Finland?,"As always, Frommer's gives very informative, accurate and helpful travel information in all the domains that their guides cover. But this seems to be precisely the problem in this case: the domains are incomplete! The book has good information for the various regions of Norway, Sweden and Denmark, and despite a lengthy section on planning a trip to Finland (a corresponding section of which appears for the other countries as well), the only thing covered in Finland is Helsinki! This is additionally frustrating, as in the Finland planning section, many intriguing places are mentioned, but how can I plan to see them if they are then given no coverage?Hence, if you're planning a trip to Denmark, Sweden and/or Norway, this book can't be beat, but if you're interested in Finalnd as well, better try another guidebook."
4,Rain in a CD,"At the end of the day, when you come home from school or work, one can't say ""I feel great."" Rather than great, we are stressed and tired. The sounds of falling rain is evermore relaxing that this CD captures it it almost perfectly. I too, am always stressed at the end of a work day and have relaxed to the sound of falling rain; and it does work. It would also be helpful to listen to while sleeping. With quiet, natural sounds, it will have a soporific effect on its listeners and relax you."
1,About of bass soud,"I want to clarify a little more the subject of low-frequency sound that possesses this CD. In principle, it tested a CD Player SACD, pre MLevinson 380s, Class A valve amp and speakers JMLab. The repetition of the defect becomes irritating as the brain detects the problem and thus renders ineffective the recording for the purpose you want to meet. If you do not listen to the top, up the control of a bass -an audiophile would not do this- and may notice the mistake of recording. I do not recommend it, then buy it, obviously."
4,Rain in the country drowns out the morning noises at our house,"After previewing several white noise cd's we chose this one because it sounded the most like an actual rainy day, and less like orchestrated static designed to sound like rain. After listening to it in full, we are satisfied with it. It is a steady rain sound, no thunder or dripping noise. It drowns out the morning noises of the household for my husband who works nights and has to sleep when everyone else is getting ready for school and day shift work, and it also camouflages the noise made by the neighbor's barking dogs and traffic."
4,Puts me to sleep every time!,"I love this CD! After buying two other CDs at Target that were supposed to help relax and soothe, I was desperate to find something that REALLY worked. I am so glad I found this one. It is so relaxing and it sounds just like nature's rain. It may or may not repeat like other reviews say but that didn't matter to me - I actually go to sleep! The only reason I only gave it four stars is because, yes, as it sounds just like rain and thunder, it can be very loud but once you set the volume right, goodnight!"
1,Low Frequency rumble that repeats about every 45 seconds makes this recording useless for me to relax with,"After carefully researching as many rain recordings as possible on Amazon and reading all reviews I had hoped I had made a good choice with this CD. Unfortunately I discovered that not only is the recording looped about every 60 seconds but there is an unmistakable low frequency rumble that is very apparent listening though my 5.1 system and my Bose Tri-Port headphones. As a recording engineer I recognize this to most likely be a truck or car passing by and passing the sound up through the microphone stands that were obviously not de-coupled from the ground. The bottom line is I hear this rumble each and everytime I start to relax and it renders the CD completely useless to me. The recording is otherwise a good one and the stereo image presented seems authentic. Since nobody else has complained of this rumble, I will assume that it will only bother someone with a trained ear."
5,wonderful rain sounds,"This CD has the pleasant sounds of rain falling outside your window. There are no sounds of frogs croaking or birds chirping, etc., which I find unpleasant, as they keep me awake. I put this CD on repeat and it plays throughout the night. I REALLY like this soothing sound of rain that is on this CD. It is the best ""rain CD"" that I've found. I have given away a couple of other ""rain CDs"" because they had ""thunder sounds"" & ""frogs/birds/etc.sounds"" BUT this CD is just ""wonderful rain sounds""!"
2,Lovely Rain,"I have always loved the sound of rain. This CD has captured that sound perfectly--with no other sounds or music to distract.The rain itself has different sounds--when the wind blows a sheet of rain, when the rain falls in the puddle it has created, when it rains very hard, when the rain is lighter. It's a lovely CD to fall asleep to."
5,music with a punch,"Though I personally prefer the purely acoustic sound of his other cds over this more folk rock one, this is nevertheless a brilliant cd. Unlike the endless drivel of bubble gum pop songs played incessantly on corporate radio stations and mtv, this music has meaning and depth and right-on politics. Like Norman Finkelstein, Tanya Reinhart, Michael Neumann, Noam Chomsky, Starhawk, Amy Goodman, Yesh Gvul, Gush Shalom, Rabbis for Human Rights and the many Jewish members of Women In Black, David Rovics is part of a growing chorus of radical Jews demanding justice for the Palestinian people. I commend his courage and celebrate his talent.p.s., if you're interested in Palestinian issues, check out some of the many books by the late great Edward Said!"
1,Not worth the money,"I was very disappointed with 'The Lazlo Letters'! This book might be slightly humorous if you are over the age of 50. You have to have known what was going on in politics in the 1970's to have any appreciation whatsoever for this book. I wouldn't recommend it. If you are looking for something truly hilarious, I recommend 'Letters From a Nut'."
4,Pretty Funny,It was a funny book but more than that it exposed some so called brilliant people as not being so brilliant as to pick up on their leg being pulled. Many of them did know it but answered out of courtesy. I did not see asny answers to Laslo's letters that chided him for ignorance. Not that I wanted to see that but it seems someone would have.
4,Pretty Darn Good,"I had read Letters from a Nut by Ted Nancy and was made aware of the original Lazlo letters. Having read the book, I was, of course, entertained.We see the world through the eyes of Lazlo Toth, American Hero. A man who berates the Hershey Corporation upon receiving a deformed M&M.; A man who ""congradulates"" Richard Nixon repeatedly for taking on all those ""Commie newsmen."" A man who writes new lyrics to The Lady is a Tramp and submits his version, The Lady is a Queen, to Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth.Having read Nancy's book first, I must say that I found that book to have more entertainment (the idea of a bus passenger dressed as a giant stick of butter still continues to amuse me) than Toth's ""Fight! Fight! Fight!"" But you can't knock an original, and all will enjoy Lazlo's letters and his courteous replies from those who can't decide whether or not Lazlo is for real!"
4,"Begging for a sequel to ""The Lazlo Letters""","In the Mae Brussell Collection, I came across this wonderful book by Don Novello. Humerous, educational, empathetic, insightful - it is a must read. I assume that Don Novello (Lazlo) still has the original letters he received from the powerful public figures to whom he wrote. If so, I hope that he prices these ageless treasures and publishes a book detailing the current worth of his priceless collection. Curators, such as myself, would love to see that sequel."
5,Dude this book is epic,"This book teaches you so much at the same time. Every lesson is divided into the major and minor keys, starting with C Major. Then there's tons of practice with speed, rhythm, fingering, slurs, ties, crescendos, embouchures and strength exercises, etc. This book jam packs so much learning in a small, thin book. I'm a huge fan of this book. I pretty much a one-stop shop for a beginner to intermediate. I think if you're VERY new, though, you might want to get a level 1 book that teaches you how to finger the instrument. Also, get yourself a fingering chart because this book does not have a fingering chart. You can print those off the internet for free for whatever instrument you play. Still, though, this book is awesome and loaded. It might seem a little daunting at first, since it's nearly 100% music (no words)...but keep at it and you'll see that even the most modest practice session yields a huge amount of results. Good luck!"
1,NO A GOOD BUY,These are terrible.The back end do not stretch enough to make it possible to attach them to the end of a sleeve. I my opinion.....they are useless.
4,Without a Trace-Second Season,I have enjoyed this show since its debut and hope they will put out all seasons on DVD. Strong writing and excellent cast that balances character development with intrigueing stories and manages not to go down the slippery path to becoming another prime time soap opera. There is a good reason that it has had strong and respectable ratings for several seasons.
4,"Not as intriguing as season 1, but still a keeper","Season 1 of Without a Trace was really intriguing throughout the entire season; I don't find that to be true of season 2 but it is still played well enough by the actors and actresses to hold my attention. the endings to some of the episodes left me unsatisfied, but Anthony LaPaglia still made each episode worth watching."
4,WIthout a trace,Another great season with more great stories. The characters are the same with little detail about their lives. There is one particular episode that is not worth anyone's watching. It is gross and very disgusting. It is called Sons and Daughters.Other than this one episode I can recommend this tv series.
1,Vendor Mediablasters Sucks!,"Don't buy from Mediablasters. I love Without a Trace, but they sent me a USED product advertised as NEW. Couldn't play it on my equipment, and vendor wouldn't respond to emails. Amazon, bless them, had to interefere for me to finally get my money back. Then I bought a great collection."
5,I love this show,I just started watching season one and it is great!!! It is a great mystery and it is fun to try and solve the puzzles with them
5,Without a trace second season,This series will keep you on the edge of your seat...the lives of the characters are diverse and interesting. Awesome.
4,Computer viewing of TV episode: Wannabe,"I found it very easy to use the process to find and to view this episode. I had seen a mention of it in a review, and I was amazed to find out how simple the process was. The quality of the video and sound were excellent."
5,"Yeah, when are the rest of the seasons coming to DVD?","wow, i got this season for $15.99 a few weeks ago and i should have gotten more for presents.love the show and can't wait for more."
5,Terrific book!,"Maisel's new book goes where the other book proposal books haven't ventured, into the territory of ideas. He carefully describes how ideas morph the more you think about the book you're intending to write and why that morphing is such a challenge for the nonfiction book writer. Then he tells you exactly how to stay with the process so that you end up not only with a polished, effective book proposal but with a book that matches the dream you had for it.Unlike the other book proposal books, which have been written by literary agents or editors, this one comes from a real writer. This is a terrific book and I recommend it without qualification or reservation."
2,Nothing Great,"Two major problems with this book. the first is that it specifically caters (not mentioning it on the front or back) towards a book proposal for a NON-FICTION book that you HAVEN'T written yet. The second is that of all advice, half of it is basic common sense, which I'm all for, but it was way too basic. By the last chapter, I was flipping through the pages just reading the headlines to consider reading the paragraphs. If you are thinking about writing a book and have never done so, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU, especially if it is going to be non-fiction. Otherwise, don't bother, it don't help you that much."
5,Nuts and bolts from someone who understands the creative mind!,Dr. Maisel's book is comprehensive and practical - with exercises and checklists that'll get you through the proposal-writing process successfully. I highly recommend this book.
2,Should have been recalled,"this laptop has a known issue related to the AMD chip overheating. They have released an emergency bios update which makes the fan run at all times. HP has also created a program allowing people to get their laptop serviced for 2 years from the original purchase date. Basically, this laptop should have been recalled because so many have failed, and simply making the fan run at all times is a cheap fix by HP."
1,Junk,"Same problems as everyone else - it won't start up half the time and when it does it takes a long time. Now it won't start at all. I couldn't even count the number of times I had to reformat it. Now I can't even get it to reformat or start with the recovery disks. HP is aware that there is a component/design problem and there was a class action suit, but I missed the window to have it repaired and now I'm stuck with a piece of junk. I would NEVER buy another HP product after this experience. Whether on warranty or not this should be repaired or replaced if there is a design defect. HP doesn't stand behind its products and ripped off everyone who bought one of these."
1,The Book is disappointing,The Book has examples which needs to be downloaded from publishers website. The examples often do not work with explorer 5. Though the book deals with cross browser examples but the examples can be downloaded only in a PC and unzipped in a PC. The examples can not be downloaded in a UNIX machine. The book does not deliver its promises at all and overall it was a disappointment.
2,JavaScript & JScript,"Too much JavaScript, not enough JScript. I was hoping that this book would serve as a JScript reference based on the title but there was only one chapter on serverside JScripting. If I had actually paid for it, I would be ..."
4,Java Script and J Script,"This book I bought from Pakistan and found it excelent to learn Java Script basics. The book's start is very organized and well written but became little confuzing at the end. The book is not crystal clear about the differences in J Script & Java Script and do not tell how to find its alternate in each other respectively. It becomes fuzzy when writer explains about Live Wire programming, otherwise it excelent.I will rate it most suitable for those how want to learn Java Script from the scratch as it covers all basic building blocks an average programmer may require."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This book contains invalid code samples. I copied one of it's codes exactly and tried to use it with Internet Explorer 5, Netscape Communicator 4.6, and Netscape Navigator 3. They all gave me javascript errors. It spends too much time on talking about Javascript code and it's origins and not nearly enough time on HOW to code. I strongly suggest that you don't buy this."
2,Disappointment,"When I purchase the book, I thought it would help me to understand Javascript as the word ""mastering"" implied. Nonetheless, it cannot explain clearly the interaction with form submission beside asking the reader to point to a CGI script in the author's website. It lacks the depth of pointing out the usefulness and how to use email to substitute for GGI file. The cookies explanation was over simplified and did not teaches the reader how to write a good cookie using good technique. It's a disappointment for me overall. I giving a two stars because the author allows the reader to download the codes from the web as it did helps me to get along with some of the codes in the book."
2,A crapper,Some of the scripts are useful i na canned way and if you know programming you can perhaps tweak them to your use. But the book does little to help you learn javascript... just example programs and screens.. no teaching of the why's & how's. There are better references on the web for free.
5,This book is excellent,"Jaworski explains not only the syntax but basic principles behind the programming. Very handy for anyone, regardless of programming experience!The book will help you to get started very, very quickly. There are great examples, showing you exactly what you can do with Javascript.I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending this book - my copy has yet to see my shelf!"
1,Thin and warped,"I agree that the almond color matches the stove perfectly. Too bad they arrived so badly warped that they don't sit flat, they sit visibly crooked on the burners. I have tried holding them under hot water and putting something heavy on them on the counter to see if I can soften the material and then get it to cool flat, but they continue to be twisted and warped. Poor quality; I suggest you look at better-made ones."
1,WHAT THE ????,"If you are looking for that Little Texas or his first two solo album sounds, you WILL NOT get that here, this is probably one of the biggest departures from a genre of music I have ever heard, the music has no country in it, and that is what this singer is known for. I would personally give it a Beatles/Paul McCartney meets Sheryl Crow sound, take note, these are great artists, my biggest disappointment, was I thought his old stuff solo and L.T. was great stuff, fun country party stuff, this however, makes one wonder, what in the world has happened to Brady , where did the fun music guy go. I bought the CD this morning and sorry to say, I returned it 4 hours later for a local store credit. Not what I thought I was getting."
2,Little Point,"The content is broad, the advice general, and this book just doesn't rise to the level of the works of other authors who have tackled this subject. There are many fine books on this subject, and this is not among them. Pass."
2,Leave this one to starboard,"There is no doubt that the author has been to sea. The problem is the format that he and his editor developed to communicate his experience. There is a paragraph about every topic imaginable. Which would be great if Tor were an extraordinarily gifted writer with a very clear point of view. But he is not a particularly good writer, and the point of view is so broad that he has no chance of doing much of this content justice.IMHO you should put Dashew, Seiffert, Caldwell, Sutphen and Leonard aboard before you even start to think about this one. At that point it's a why bother."
2,Thomas gets focus grouped,"Or so it seems in this ensemble. It is as if a bunch of toy execs came up with some new ideas and needed to write them into the mythos. If you love classic Thomas you won't get any of it here. It's calculated to push product, from the new (and DULL) construction machines - a pilot for a spinoff and two big new variations on Gordon: stuck up Spencer and grumpy Murdoch-neither of whom has any appeal.The new female engine Emily again seems plotted as a transparent means of attracting little girls. Unfortunately her character is (and will continue to be) thinly written and stereotyped. If they want to attract girls they need to understand them better. I doubt anyone will warm to a train portrayed as alternately cluelss and bitchy.The series doesn't need new hardware. It needs some writers with a little heart and love for the characters-and the kids.Toddlers will sit through this but it lacks the magic and charm of the earlier stories."
5,My toddler LOVES this movie!,My son is a Thomas addict and a construction addict. So he was completely enchanted with the new character Jack the Loader and the adventures at the quarry with the rest of the construction vehicles. He asks for this video again and again.
4,"I would give it 2 stars, myself: BUT...","My 4 year old Thomas addict LOVES this video and begs to watch it over and over: so, it DOESN'T MATTER that I (the adult) find it derivative of Bob the Builder, and dislike the ""new"" narrator (he doesn't even TRY and distinguish between the character's voices!). Sure, ""Ms. Jenny"" is a doppelganger for Bob's ""Wendy"": but at least she's a woman in charge - not a demanding shrew (Lady Hatt), a screaming shrew (Alicia Batti), or a damsel in distress (the ever-rescued Mrs. Kindly). I have spent the last 3 years watching the same 20 or so tapes over and over and over again, til I've started dreaming about trains... so ANY new Thomas videos are welcome, in my house."
2,Let's make lots more money by inventing 25 new characters!,"Wow, is this ever a vehicle for inventing more new characters! The song at the end is about five new engines in the shed, but that is not counting all the endless construction vehicles in the weird construction oriented story. It wasn't a bad story but really doesn't go with the Thomas world. Some of the new characters are cool but we only saw them briefly and it just seemed like a money making scheme. The different narrator was distracting, he was OK but not what we are used to, I didn't like how he does Sir Topham Hatt but otherwise he was fine just different. Though I understand that he is the one who narrates them as originally shown in Great Britain.Overall not one I am eager to see again, fortunately we did not buy it just rented it. Of course my 2 year old loves the new trains though. They are cool to look at especially Spencer."
2,Thomas PLC,"I'm a bit torn on this one. The narrator does a very good job with the accents (remember, Sodor was supposed to be between the Isle of Man and NW England); much better than Baldwin. And the new engines look good (Spencer is an A4, and would be a younger cousin of Gordon's; Murdoch is a fine-looking Class 9F, like ""Evening Star,"" the last steam engine built by BR). But the stories just aren't as good as the original Awdry ones. There are plenty of stories left from the originals that have never been produced (see ""Thomas the Tank Engine: The Complete Collection) -- HIT Entertainment should drink from the well, not the puddle.The games are also mediocre, and the voices that accompany the games are just dreadful."
5,Great book,Excellent book for beginners like myself! A good balance of theory and practice. I really liked how the author described different types of meditation techniques. I experimented with all of them and picked the ones that worked for me. I would highly recommend this book!
1,Not bad for a dummies,I did not purchase this book - returned it because of this and I am not goign to add any more.
1,Too comlex,"The style of meditation described in this book is much too complicated. Meditation, to be effective, has to be effortless. Maharishi is the top expert in this area. There is a good reason why TM, transcendental meditation, is so popular with millions of practioners having learned over the last 50 years."
2,not what i exspected!!!,"This book really isn't so good... The first 150 pages is used to really show how the AUTHOR thinks of things, and HIS filosophies... (sp?) Then the meditation, its shown pretty good on 20 pages, and thats it. Then there are all the history and stuff once more! Sure, it learned me to meditate, but i could have saved countles hours if someone just said ""close your eyes, repeat a word in your mind, and you got it"" instead of reading all this stuff, which i dont even agree with!"
5,"If you can only buy 1 book on meditation, this is it!","I never thought I'd write that a book with ""for dummies"" in the title was one of the most interesting and thorough books I've ever read, but Mr. Bodian's work definitely deserves high praise. As he says in his own review above, this book's title is a misnomer, anyway. It should be something like ""Meditation for Just About Anyone/Everyone"".This book is so thorough and well thought out that it is hard to imagine anyone who is interested in learning more about meditation not discovering something of value regardless of what sparked that interest in the first place. In fact, should someone with NO interest in meditation happen to pick it up, I think they would ""discover"" an interest in it. It's that well done.The reader will find information on ""how-to"", applications in everyday life, the history of meditation, references to other resources and much more. All that is missing is someone to do the meditation for you!"
5,A helpful guide to basic meditation,"This is the perfect book for anyone who wants to learn more about basic meditation. In addition to guiding us through different methods of meditation step by step, Stephen Bodian also gives us a short summary of the history of meditation which is interesting and in the same time puts everything into context.The book can also help you get past the difficulties you might encounter during mediation. All in all a great book."
2,Boring,"I found this book boring. It goes on and on about the same thing. I wouldn't recommend it. But, if you've got lots of patience which is what you need for meditation. Then go for it."
3,CD lets it down,"I am fairly new to meditation, having listened to Glenn Harrold'sA Guided Meditation for Relaxation, Well Being and Healingnearly put me off for life! I then tried this one, and having since done so I triedBeyond Mindfulness in Plain English: An Introductory guide to Deeper States of Meditationby Bhikkhu Henepola Gunaratana, which I highly recommend. I thought it worth pointing any listener in the right direction."
3,Meditation reference book,"I bought this book only for a meditation class. It is quite like a text book,too. It is comprehensive in that it describes different ways to meditate. For easier reading and more heart, I would recommend Meditation by Eknath Easwaran. Use Meditation for Dummies as a reference book."
2,There are better books,"I found this book to be highly superficial, not really develing into the various meditative approaches (which any beginner like me can do). Also, the key points were fragmented within the chapters, making it hard to follow the issue/approach to meditation.I found Jack Kornfields audio CD ""Meditation for Beginners"" to be quite excellent and I recomend as a first endeavour into meditation."
5,very easy book,i love to unwind and relax my mind and allow nature and the planet to pass by and do its thing and sometimes finding a moment to unwind and get in touch with the inner soul can be hard work depending on what you have to do through out your day or not and where the day might take you. this book is very much needed and brings out a calming pressence and eases the tension. this book is like a twelve step program on how to ease your mind and focus on you. a much needed book
3,El Jarama,"I only recently (last six or seven years) learned to read Spanish. It is an excellent exercise for one's brain. El Jarama is written almost entirely in dialogue, much of it idiom, so it was very difficult. I nevertheless found it truly challenging and enjoyed it."
5,R U SERIOUS ??????,"I would love to have this CD, but $85.00 ???? get real !!!! , I counteroffer at $25.00, how can Amazon let you try to gauge ppl like this?"
3,A slice of Cuban music,"This is non-stop Cuban music as our star, a street singer named El Gallo (or Miguel Del Morales), moves from town to town, meeting new people and reconnecting with old friends, and jamming with musicians all over the island. It gives one a sense of the vitality and breadth of such music, which the people love. However, one needs to be patient and watch it from beginning to end, and read the subtitles unless you speak Spanish fluently, which I do not."
2,Disappoined,Sorry to say but this CD was just boring. I think there may only be one song that actually caught my attention and made me want to listen. Sorry no like.
3,Spector wasn't even here in spirit for half of this collections,"You can tell this is a bootleg because of the recordings he had nothing to do with.So its been compiled by somebody with little idea especially using the word ""Flips"" as these were mainly A sides.Today people get it right -you would never find such disregard for the facts on Ace or Jasmine.With a complete lack of a sleeve note you would never know that Jerri Bo Keeno was a one off 70s act from a time Spector was trying to restablish himself.The long gone Rare Masters sets were nearer the mark"
2,For hardcore fans only,This is a DVD/CD combo pack. The DVD was previously released as 'Things That Make You Go Mmmm'. It is an unauthorized biography. The CD contains audio interviews. I would consider this package a must for hardcore My Chem fans only.
1,Doesn't support Windows Playlists,"I assumed a $150+ flash player that uses Windows Media Player 10 as its transfer software would also allow playlists. However, mine did not transfer, and further reading in the manual shows what it calls 'playlists' are actually the folders where the music is recorded. This means you cannot build separate lists that include the same song without recording the song each time, gobbling up memory. Since there was no warning of this on the package, I will never again buy an audio player from Panasonic. I've wasted too much money already on a player that won't allow me to transfer customized lists of music! My attempts to contact Panasonic to question this have been unanswered."
5,A fix for book 'readers',"I use my MP020 only for 'reading' books. Another reviewer mentioned the slow scan issue. There is a solution for this. If you check online you can find free, audiobook slicers. These can slice up the file into smaller pieces, say 5-10 mins of sound. Then if you accidentally go back to the beginning, all you have to do is jump to the proper slice and you aren't spending 30 mins seaching into a 3 hour boo boo. (speaking from bitter experience)"
4,"It's fine, but...","...I use my player to listen to books, which brings up a strong negative. With other players I have used, when I held down the search (>> OR <<) button, the forward or reverse went faster and faster the longer I held down the button. Not so with this device. It goes about 10x speed, and that's it. Once I accidentally restarted a book of which I'd listened to 3 hours. I had to push the search button down for a half hour to get back to where I was!!"
2,controller left joystick broke very fast,i must say when it comes to looks you cannot beat this product however it is cheaply made the left joystick on both controllers broke while playing
1,"Do Not Buy, Very Poor Quality Joysticks","Bought this while I was Deployed, to unwind and relax from the hectic days in the desert and the 1st one broke the same day i started using it, the 2nd broke 2 day later. Terrible, Terrible product, Bad quality of product,...P. S. I still have them if you want them back.. Buyers Beware!!!"
3,The Terminator,"Intended as an apologia for termination, the US government's attempt during the McCarthy era to eradicate reservations, this book is useful to scholars for its factual research. Others will find it tedious and confusing due to the author's conflation of ethnocide and autonomy."
2,"Self analysis, not food lit","I usually do not put aside a book before finishing it. In this case, I got about a third of the way through and just skimmed the rest and could not bring myself to read it in detail. I purchased this book hoping (despite prior reviews) that it was more food lit than self analysis. However, the strength of this book is in its description of tense family relationships, and indeed not in its descriptions of food in Desalvo's life. If you are interested in it anyway, good luck - there is a lot of emotion in it."
2,bittersweet and funny . . . ultimately a downer,"So sad. Even has her mother lay dying, she wishes Mom was someone else. A cautionary tale on accepting people as they really are."
1,Book as Ipecac,"OMG....I forced myself to get beyond page 13 and just had to give it up. There really isn't any 'food'in her repetitive writing, but a lot of angst squished up into a white bread samich that apparently NO one wants to eat, each for their own screwed up, twisted reasons.... what this book did for my stomach was put it in knots..... BASTA!This book makes me happy I am Sicilian NOT ""Italian-American""."
5,Classic Holzer!,"This book is classic Hans Holzer. It is a compilation of spooky and spectral stories and lore told to Holzer and re-told by him. Holzer bolsters his subject's stories by sometimes using psychics and sometimes conducting historical research to confirm facts. The majority of the stories in this book were told to Holzer in the 1960's and 1970's during the peak of his investigative prowess.Although his techniques pale by today's modern ""ghost hunting"" standards, Hans Holzer will always be one of the great pioneers in paranormal research.The stories are sometimes a little dry, sometimes a little boring, and sometimes nonplussing but their essence is superb Holzer at his best!Five stars without reservation.JP"
4,Memories,"In the 1960s when I was growing up, Dr. Holzer was a minor celebrity who often showed up on shows like 'The Merve Griffin Show"" and similar talk shows. He also wrote what seemed like hundreds of books concerning experiences he'd had with people and their ""haunted"" houses. He was a major role in my interest in the paranormal, which I still have. Holzer wasn't perfect-he was a name dropper, he could be washpish about his disagreements with people (I remember he was mad at the VanTrapp family from ""The Sound of Music, who ran a hotel of some sort He said they ran a ""Van Tourist Trapp."") I bought the giant print version of this book-I may have to get the kindle version and sell the old one. The print version weighs about 15lbs and is enormous. I have a great affection for Dr. Holzer and hope he's happy wherever he is now. This is a good book to have. Some stories are very good and some are mediocre. I recommend this book."
4,Not a bad read,"The author of this book makes it interesting to read with tons of facts and pretty creepy encounters. Tons of different kinds of stories/experiences to read here. Also includes some pictures the author took, which add to the visuals you imagine when reading. I'm pretty happy with this purchase!"
2,Not what I was expecting,Iwas expecting more entertainment regarding ghosts.......Spooky things intrigue me. The title was not specific enough to give insight into te book
2,Not very good,"More than a good ghost story book, which is what I was looking for, I got a shameless self-promoting pamphlet for a self-proclaimed ghost and haunting expert. I don't buy into the ""medium walks in house-gets possessed-screams,kicks, growls-says a little girl died here, its there at the corner staring and waving at us""-etc. Blah-blah-blah as far as I'm concerned. Dissapointing. Implausible. And yes, I believe in the possibility of ghosts, but this has the stench of made up stuff all over it. Better material out there."
3,Dreary History Lesson!,"This is a terribly tedious history lesson in the main, mostly American with some other bits and pieces thrown in, but it's so dull that it takes a strong heart to get past the first 25% so that at least we finally get to some hauntings. This man obviously thinks he is the only true and proper authority on the subject, which is ludicrous, and he contradicts himself time and again - when he's not repeating himself! There's a lot of interesting material here, but you really have to sift through to find it. He's arrogant and dismissive of other people's ideas, which is not helpful."
3,Holzer Rehash,"This handsome (if oddly organized) hardcover book turns out to be just a compilation of Holzer's cheaply produced paperbacks from the 1960s. If you've never read Holzer before, then this latest book will serve as a great introduction to Holzer's dogged pursuit of the supernatural. On the other hand, if you have read those earlier Holzer's books, then you may feel, as I did, disappointed. Holzer could have produced a truly interesting book had he returned to the scenes of his forty-year old ghost stories. Are the ghosts still active? Who owns the haunted houses now? Have changes in the neighborhoods affected the hauntings?"
4,It's big. It's good. I like it.,"Believe it or not--as big as this book is, I've pretty much read the entire thing cover to cover. That's how good I think it is. Really, it's the only book on ghosts you need...not that anyone really needs a book about ghosts. Okay so some of it is just a bunch of scientific mumbo jumbo, but the actual ghost stories are pretty interesting. It also contains some cool photos. My only complaint, really, is that it's size makes it a bit awkward to carry around. I guess it's well worth the workout though."
3,No wonder I bought this on sale......,"The book is full of editorial mistakes. These include misspellings of names, different dates throughout the sections of descriptions, etc. I was constantly flipping back to doublecheck something. Furthermore, sometimes the sections repeated themselves, only written differently, which led me to think he was trying to make the book as large as possible. And not all the research is his own, it would seem, because sometimes there would be only a decription of a haunting from somewhere with no mention of his involvement.Overall though, the book is interesting and full of excellent and well documented accounts. Particularly, I am impressed by his striving to keep the medium away from an initial interactions with the 'victims', or not providing any background information on an investigation. He makes one critique, I think, of Ed and Lorraine Warren, and wonders how much animosity lies between these two types of researchers....."
1,This book deserves less than 1 star,"This book is nothing more than a compilation of earlier stories, none of them very well-written or particularly interesting. The writing style is that of a high-school term paper, and there is no addendum or follow-up on any of the stories (which were originally written several decades ago). I wouldn't recommend buying this book if you are looking for a scary night-time read."
1,Who Gave Him the Ph.d?,"I yearn for a good compilation of all the houses and places in America reputed to be haunted. This, however, is nothing more than an extended (and, physically, weighty) advertisement for the ghost-hunting services of Mr. Hans Holzer. Mr. Holzer proves the existence of ghosts through the use of selective truth-telling, suspect methods, bad photography, and, often, hilariously stupid reasoning. I remain unconvinced of anything other than the fact that there is a large market of gullible souls who can't handle the fact that their minds and a few crafty entenpreneurs like Mr. Holzer can play tricks on them. Holzer is reputed to be a Ph.d: I'd like to know what stalwarts of senility were on his doctoral defense committee."
4,Only for those interested in research.,"If you're wanting to use this book as a reference, then it is ideal. However, if you're just out to read a good ghost story, then this isn't the book for you. This book explores many parts of the paranormal realm. If you are heavily interested in studying ghosts and spirits, then this book is a good deal for the price."
5,Packed With Stories And Info,"I saw a reviewer call this book ""The Complete Hans Holzer"", and I must say I completely agree. This book is packed I literally mean PACKED with stories, history, advice for those interested in ghost hunting, and much more. This is a treasure trove for those interested in the paranormal. This book is also extremely big (800 pages or so) and it doesnt get boring there is just so much there you really feel like you are getting what you pay for. Two thumbs up!"
3,"Stuck on yourself, Hans?","Well, I bought this book figuring it was going to be a whole lot of ghost stories... It's kind of is and kind of isn't. I can't seem to get hooked on this book; maybe because I can't hold it up while lying in bed or because Hans Holzer may be a little (uh-hem) stuck on himself? He likes talking about ghost hunts he's been on, not ones that he's ever heard about or researched. It's not all a bad book; it just isn't what I was looking for. In the stories, he mainly discusses the goings on while he's there (seances, etc.). He doesn't do any research on the houses to find out what past owners have been there, who the ghosts might be, he just straight up asks the ghosts who they are. Like I said, it's not a bad book, I just can't get hooked on it. And make sure to read the dimensions and weight because it is HEAVY!!"
2,DOESN'T FIT,I ordered this product for my 2009 Dodge Ram and the mounting holes do NOT match up! It appears to be the correct size and the hardware seems to be great quality but it DOES NOT FIT.
4,Flipping Dog,I purchased a used one! I was very surprised at what excellent shape it was in. I put batteries in it and it works perfectly!
3,cute,I thought it did more then just flip over. but it was ok for the price.. my grand daughter liked it but nothing really special .. he barks and flips over
5,Revamped Flipping Dog Toy,"I had a little brown and white dog that did the same thing back when I was a kid (called ""Tippy""), and I remember really loving that toy! So, naturally, I thought our two girls would enjoy Fido. Sure enough, I was right! It's such a simple toy, but still a winner!"
2,toy dog,This toy was ok. I gave it to my grand daughter for her first birthday..The dog has yet to land on its feet but she has fun picking it up and putting back on its feet to jump again.It's bak is a little anoying after awhile.I don't think I would buy it again.
2,"Wonderfully creative, but...","I gave this book 2 stars because, while the storyline is intricate, and the characters varied and interesting, the writting style leaves much to be desired.Mainly, it seems diconnected. The threads of the plot are cut in too many pieces, and then lined up just a little off. It didn't have the depth I usually look for in a book like this. Nothing is ever really explained, and while I know people can pick up many of these things on their own, it would have been nice to have a little more help.It's not all bad though. There are many good ideas, and much that can be followed up on and expanded.All in all, I would have enjoyed this book a great deal more if it had made more sense at any point. Sorry, but I'm just being honest.I will, however, read the next one anyway. It has the promise of a great story."
4,An interestingly complex fantasy adventure,"This fantasy book's setting is unusul, it feels like ancient lands or perhaps a low tech future. The Clans of Everien are fighting the mind enslaving Sekk with artifacts found in the floating city of Jai Pendu, which appears for one day every nine years. A group of adventurers, including the female fighter Istar, want to go to Jai Pendu to find another artifact. An older swordsman, Tarquin, is trying to recover from his Company's quest there eighteen years earlier. The writing is good and I cared for the characters. Some sequences, though creative, are cryptically strange. There are unexplained mysteries, but this is just book one of the series."
4,Superbly Written!!,"I absolutley loved this book! It had a hard to follow plot-line, and I had to read the book over again to fully understand it, but it was still grat. I really appreciated how Lieth's main character, Istar, is a female, and still a warrior. Valery Lieth kept the plot flowing, and added surprising twists that captivated my imagination, and I yearning to read the next book. The land of Everien, Jai Pendu, and the Sekk are all very imaginative, yet mysterious. AT the end of the book, some connection's are made, and mysteries revealed, but not all."
2,"Flaccid, Bloated","Not only don't you get interesting characters, the action and flow of story is dull as well. This is a book full of words, words, words, but little to get you involved. Never once did I care about what would happen next. I kept waiting for things to click into gear. It never happened. 2 stars because their are worse books out there and this one is really no worse than the rest of the limp books on the fantasy sci-fi shelves."
2,Poor copy of other better books,No wonder the auther used a pseudonym - it seems to promise a lot but is just a poor copy of many other book of the genre
4,good enough,Well its a good sword ill tell you that but there is flaus first is that at the bottom of the gaurd and at the end of the sword on the metal parts they havedragon ingraveings came with some scrathes but overall its very much luke the realthing
5,THE ULTIMATE FOR BLEACH LOVERS...,MY SON IS A HUGE BLEACH FAN AND LOVES HIS SWORD...HE ALSO NOTED THE ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND HOW IT IS ALMOST IDENTICAL TO THE WON USED BY THE SUSTITUTE SOUL REAPER ICHIGO...EXCELLENT WORKMANSHIP AS WELL...I WOULD SUGGEST THIS FOR ANYONE WHO LOVE BLEACH...GREAT PART OF ANY COLLECTION...
3,Slicing moon katana,In the picture it shows a pendant hanging down from it. When it arrived it was missing this. Otherwise a well made sword but for those who are trying to cosplay I'd recommend looking elsewhere.
3,ehh,the hilt and the sheath are both pretty cheap but it looks alright if you are not a fan of bleach get something else
3,Nice but not accurate,The picture for the 37 inch is misleading because it is not the actual item. The actual 37 inch sword does not have the chain on the end. Overall the sword feels well made. 4 for the sword 2 for the misleading picture.
4,Not Bad,Got this sword around 2 hours ago. First off I have to say I had a little trouble pulling the sword out it was over flowing with glue. Aside from that the sword looks exactly like the picture. There were also 3 other problems with the sword. First the sword has glue stuck on it which is not a big issue for me since I will wipe it down and clean it later. Second I don't know what it is called but the red thing underneath the wrapping for the handle is a little short. In some areas it doesn't extend to the end so you can see the handle which I don't like. Lastly the place where the chain is attached to *dont know what it is called* Is not glued on there. If you pull on the chain the thing it is attached to on the sword will pop off.Overall I have to say 4 stars since these issues where not that major to be besides the second and third. I was happy that the blade was intact and that the sheath was not damaged and came in good shape.
2,Blah,"I love the Provensens more than I can say, and Kathryn Jackson is reliably great, but this book should have been left out of print. It's so dated it's painful, and the twist [spoiler alert] is that Mr. Roly-Poly needs to bring in a band to make the circus really fun. What? Honestly, the circus as an institution is long since past its time, and it's just horrifying to read about scary clowns, the ""fat lady"" and animals we now know may be seriously abused in their circus service. I hate to be a circus curmudgeon, but this book is just unpleasant for modern readers, no matter how well-intentioned it was at the time."
5,A Thanksgiving Fight!,"Mr and Mrs.Wakefield invite Mrs.Wakefield's sisters,Laura and Nancy along with their children,Robin,Stacey and Kelly for Thanksgiving and all they do is fight! Alice[Mrs.Wakefield] and her sisters fight,Elizabeth and Jessica fight, Robin and Stacey fight. I think one of them runs away over the fighting."
5,Excellent illustration of sibling rivalry & the patterns,"This was one of the best SVT books I've read! A great Thanksgiving story with a lot of bittersweet memories & a good deal of family stress that marks this time of the year. The book rivals a Baby-Sitters' Club book with its deep probe into the psychology & family dynamics & poignant parts. Interesting how Alice insisted that she & her sister NEVER fought, but when her sisters Nancy & Laura show up, they fight more than Elizabeth & Jessica & their cousins! All in all, it was a lot like a BSC book...a warm, touching family gathering, but imperfect with a poignant, bittersweet ending. The families of the BSC members end up with family gatherings like that. A great Thanksgiving read!"
2,Have used better products,Aftering using Phyto Straightening Balm I had hoped that this would be as good a product as that is but I was disappointed. It didn't hydrate my hair as well as other products I have used--namely the Morocan Oil hydrating cream. I wouldn't recommend the Phyto hydrating cream to anyone with true dry hair. Save your money and/or use the Morocan oil cream.
1,not what i hoped for,"90 minutes of the same girl getting pampered. Video quality is absolute junk, it looks like they shot it with a picture phone that they couldn't get to focus. This movie is not worth the blu ray disk its on, don't hit that order button trust me i wish someone had posted a comment like this before i bought it. this director must hate everyone"
3,I expected more.,"I expected more from this video. It's not bad, just not as sexy as the cover would lead you to believe."
5,Excellent for building custom stands,"Excellent for building custom instrument stands.I used this and another (flute/picolo peg) to build stands for family members. Select a wood, use a threaded insert from a hardware store, finish, and voila! a custom stand. Use in multiples for musicians that play more than one instrument during a concert or practice session.Delivery was also timely and accurate."
3,Non-standard mounting,"The peg hold my clarinet well. The mounting screw is 3/8"", not 1/4.and I could not find an adaptor. So I had to modify the stand."
5,Velvet Covering protects the inner tube of flute from getting scratched ...impeccably made.,Peg quality is impeccable. Velvet covering prevents the inner tube of one's precious flute from getting scratched as it is inserted onto the stand. 110% Functional.I have purchased two of these - Hercules DS502B Flute/Clarinetinet PEGs ...- one to replace the plastic one which came with my cast iron flute stand base (On-Stage Stands Clarinet or Flute Stand). The incumbent plastic peg had some rough edges which scratched (once) the inner tube of my old flute.- the second Peg is used to construct a homemade flute stand using a sturdy wooden base. A great ready made spare part to use in these projects.Highly Recommended.
5,Hercules Clarinet/Flute Stand Peg,"There's really not anything complicated to say about it. It's a peg that screws into the Hercules saxophone stand legs. It's covered in velvet and holds your clarinet or flute with safety and ease. For my university's production of Hello Dolly, I purchased the sax stand and ordered two pegs, and it was a huge lifesaver. Now, I have a stand and pegs for jazz and other future uses. It's well worth it."
2,Cheap,"Fram filter media is good, but the overall quality of the filter is junk. The outer seal is press on and comes off easy. If it was for this short cut the filter would be ok. Buy a Wix filter if you want quality."
2,TOO ARTSY,"Way too artistic for me. Half the time I couldn't tell when Bagi was ""dreaming"" and when it was real time. This lack of distinction made the film feel disjointed and difficult to follow. While the images were beautiful, at times I felt that the film was simply an experiment in cinematography. Nice peak into Mongolian culture, and the realities of the herders collision with the modern world."
2,Don't confuse this for being a Mongolian film.,"I thought the premis for the story was really good and for the first two thirds of the movie I really enjoyed the film. The cinematography was stunning and highly effective. However, the last third of the film was ponderous, erratic and disappointing.The fact that the writers and directors of this film are not Mongolian is obvious as the movie falls apart in to surreal symbolism that leaves the viewer with a a bunch of loose ends at the conclusion of film. It winds up smacking of being just another pretentious European avant garde film.After watching it in entirety it's obvious why this film has remained so obscure."
1,No Scent,"I have been using Equus for years. The last two bottles I have purchased have been bad; both from discount vendors. The first was rancid and the second, this one, was odorless.I am not sure if the manufacture changed the formula or the supplier had the inventory sitting too long.In fairness to the supplier I did not register a complaint, for everyone there is a point of diminishing returns, I simply will take my business elsewhere."
5,Skin So Soft WORKS for Mosquitoes!!!!,"We live pretty much in the woods in Michigan so we get a lot of unwanted creatures. Skin So Soft works fantastic against mosquitoes from biting. It's great! We have used it for years. And this year, after 20 years, was the worst amount of mosquitoes that we have ever encountered. My husband would go on one side of the house where the mosquitoes are the thickest and they won't even light. We use the SSS Bath Oil Pump. And it smells heavenly! Thanks AVON!"
2,Does not smell good,"I bought this oil because my neighbor`s fleas attacked us when her cats were taken away. I am not sure how well it works against fleas because on the day it arrived we did a Raid spraying and it was effective. But my daughter got hives from this oil even though I diluted it.About the scent. Based on the reviews I was expecting a nice, fresh scent. I did not find it pleasant at all, reminds me some kind of pine toilet air freshener. But one thing for sure you can smell it all day long on your skin."
5,Echo's SSS,"Product arrived in good condition, no defects, tightly packaged and full. Works well on my dog for keeping off fleas, mites, mosquitoes and also on humans."
4,ok,"you still have to rub in the spray, so the ""spray bottle"" part of it is no big deal. also i would make sure you do it over a hard surface, because it gets everywhere. i bought this product because i have really dry skin, and also because it works great to keep away mosquitos."
1,Smell,I bought this to keep fleas off but the smell is horrible. It smells like old person or hippies. Yuck.
5,"Great stuff, been using it for years!","I spray this on after every shower and it keeps my skin soft all day, even in the winter months. I have been using it for years and it even repells mosquitos! The price is good on amazon and you don't have to wait for an avon rep to deliver them!"
5,mosquitoattracterinatlanta,avon skin so soft repels mosquitos very well. i have been using this product for 25 years and even used it exclusively when i went to the okeefenooche swamp.thanks for supplying such a great product!
5,Great for dogs,My dog is very sensitive to fleas and flea bites. This is a lifesaver. Not only does it repel the fleas when he is outside but it soothes his skin. He smells good too.
3,"skin is soft, bugs aren't too afraid of it","Mom used to use this on us to repel insects years ago, but it is not all that effective for my gf who mosquitos are very attracted to."
1,Not the same product as shown in picture,Beware. I was looking specifically for the older version of Avon Skin So Soft (not their current formula which have received negative reviews). The picture shown is not the same as what I received. I got the version with the newest label (and Jojoba added to boot). Very disappointed as I ordered this priority shipping in time for a week long camping trip with lots of mosquitos expected.
2,Not as great for those that get eaten alive,"I tried this product recently at the beach because I was outside at night and was getting nailed by mosquitoes. I am one of those people that is outside for an hour and comes in with at least 7 new bites. Anyway, it seemed to do a pretty good job them and I only probably got 1. I decided to buy it for myself and took it to a crab feast - boy, was I wrong. I got eaten alive still, but was also super oily. This probably works better for those that only get a few bites a summer, but if you get them often like me, I'd stick with deet products over this. Also, for some reason mine was not shipped with the spray nozzle so it was SUPER messy. Overall the product seems to have other uses so hopefully it will be good for those."
3,Avon Skin So Soft Bath Oil Spray,"I bought this product because the oils in this spray/scent were good for combating fleas, since I had tons and tons of flea bites all over my body and didn't want anymore! But I don't know if it actually helped but what did happen is that this oil (any body oil) makes me itch and the scent of Avon Skin So Soft is really overpowering! Even I'D stay away from myself!"
3,My Review,I bought Avon Skin So Soft for my dog because I heard it does a good job of keeping flies away from him. The flies are still there.
2,smells good,"Well, I knew it was going to be small but its supter tiny! Like sample size! I think the price is to much for the size."
5,smell like real man,one of the best cologne of all time smell all day mi wife love this product thats a men supose to smell yes....
4,Yummy!!!,I brought this for my fiancée for fathers day and all I can say is why did I wait so long. We havent keep our hands off each other...Get it you won't be disappointed.
1,estafa,es una verdadera estafa debido a que en la publicidad aparece un modelo y al momento de la compra no es la que sale igual en la publicación estafadores
5,SPIRITUAL ANSWERS TODAY'S QUESTIONS,This book was enlightening and very interesting. As I watch the news reports daily I become firmer in my belief that every American needs to read this book. It is essential to our future.
1,America doesn't need more mysticism and magic!!,"What is happening in America these days? You can't watch TV without being bombarded by psychics, TV evangelists, mind-readers, people who think they can communicate with the dead, faith healers, and many other types of mystics. Wake up America! Stop dodging your personal responsibility and hoping for EASY ANSWERS to life's difficult problems! Look to yourself and find a real solution, not a pie in the sky answer promoted by the self-promoters."
2,Interesting but not convinced,"The world is really short of Franklin Pierce materials. True scholarly work is nearly non-existent, which is why I applaud the author for his investment to bring this unknown man into the spotlight. While the book has quality material, I do question it's thoroughness and am a little critical. If a University publisher had backed this up I feel it would have been better received as a quality writing because it would have had the endorsement and examination that comes to scholarly print. I definitely do not want to discourage the author, but I think that reading this with a companion book on the same material would make this more authentic."
1,TERRIBLE BOOK,"This is a poor effort by Jordan. Capable of far better analysis, he shuffles off the last three chapters and it reads like a dull text. Don't purchase it, I'm sorry I did!"
1,A REVIEW BY A READER,"This work is littered with mistakes, especially in the grammar department and in some cases the flow of the book. Apparently not a stylist, this book should be thrown off the shelves. The information is incorrectly cited."
5,Microsoft Money 2006 For Dummies,As can be found in the ...for Dummies series... Lots of help and easy to find the answer to your problem. I had one specific question and found the answer right away. Now I have the book to find any other problem solver when needed.
3,"Slightly dated Sci-Fi, but worth a read.","Space Mavericks was written at the beginning of the 1980s and, in style of writing, is beginning to show its age. The book combines Warp engines and ancient 'magic', the overall feel reminds me of the classic ""Out of the silent planet"" by CS Lewis, but a bit darker with more than a couple of nasty fight scenes. The characters are not as developed as we expect from toady's books, this leaves them appearing a little shallow. However it's worth a read, there are a couple of nice sci-fi ideas. It's a shame the author didn't carry the series on, it would have been nice to see the characters developed further."
3,When Sci Fi was simple - and fun.,"Okay guys, so the plot is just that, pretty simple. The two characters, hero and sidekick, are just that. Like the other two reviewers say, this is just old style Sci Fi: No terrible angst, no bitter pasts, no fate of all the known worlds resting on your conscience, just a couple of guys caught up in something and taking the straightforward ""beat up the bad guys"" approach. And who the hell cares about the description of 'hyperspace'? For goodness sake - it's not real! As was said by A.V., if it was, we'd all be travelling to the stars. This book - and it's sequel - are there for the fun of it - something to divert you from the realities of a rainy day. It's not Shakespeare or Dickens, not Heinlein or Azimov, its just a moderate Sci Fi story. I read it many, many, years ago, found the sequel by accident and would really love to find the third book (if it ever existed). As the other guy said, put your brain on hold and enjoy some old style space opera."
5,Rare and very local,I have been a brewer for more than two decades and being from Maryland I have looked for this book since 1995. I have only borrowed a copy to read. It is very specific to the Maryland brewing scene up to the 60's when the then Carling brewing plant was the modern brewery out on the beltway ( now demolished)Unfortunately on a brewer's salary I have found it but can not afford it.
3,Not what I expected,"years ago, I was into Parson Technology products. So now that Broderbund hasParson products I am not getting my expected results"
1,recived a disasembled used part in a greasy box!,"i received the order today, opened it and was shocked! there were greasy hand prints all over the box, writing on it, and to my horror used disassembled parts inside the box! on closer examination, there's obvious wear marks on the parts from where thy have been run etc.i know you probably arnt "" auto parts people "" but come on.... looking @ the box should be the first clue!"
4,The Cast of Amontillado,"I've read a few of Edgar Allan Poe's stories and found them very intriguing, to say the least. One of my favorites being ""The Cast of Amontillado."" Poe really brings out the darker side of one's personality in his stories. I think he expresses his hardship growing up through his writings. Once you pick up one of Poe's books, you would want to read more and more. His stories are mystefying and frightening. They may make you want to laugh and cry all at the same time. If you are really in the mood to get lost in darkness, mystery and intrigue, pick up one of Poe's books. You'll be glad you did."
5,"Wow, I'm dead!","I loathe myself, but I do love my books. I even love them more from beyond the grave! Pick up this book and a fifth of whiskey, and you won't be sorry!"
1,DVD's HORRIBLE QUALITY,"The material itself is FANTASTIC, I loved this show growing up and did the happy dance when I saw it was finally on DVD. But the DVD's themselves are defective, freeze ups, skipping it's so disappointing... Marty and Kent if you ever read these reviews... YOU DID YOUR JOB AND ALL OF TRUE BLUE ADAM-12 FANS LOVE YA!!! But Universal BOOOOO!!!!!!!! FYI I had the EXACT SAME PROBLEMS with my Dragnet 1967 and Emergancy! DVD sets....."
5,10 - Hands Down,"I grew up watching shows such as Adam-12, Dragnet, Emergency, and The Love Boat. Adam-12 was always one of my absolute favorites. Even though I have seen the episodes about 50 times each, I still find them exciting. Unfortunately, they do not make shows of this quality and type anymore. I wish they did. I also wish that they would finally come out with Season 2 of Adam-12. It's been years since the first season was released! Exactly how long are we supposed to wait for the shows we want to see? We have no trouble gaining access to the junk that's on television today, so why can't we get the quality shows we desire?"
1,Poor Quality!!,Don't waste your money buying this DVD. I should have check the other reviews about the recording's poor quality. Amazon promptly refunded my purchase though. 3 out of 4 DVDs are defective.
5,Adam 12,"I'm deployed in Iraq and this is the BEST ""care package"" yet. My eyes lit up! ALthough I'm not old enough to have seen Adam-12 when it first came out, I can't forget the reruns played on TV. I was disappointed when TVLand took it off the are several years ago. I heard a rumor it was on again but I kinda don't have access to a TV right now.Adam-12 is without a doubt the best cop series ever made. I haven't experienced any problems with my DVD except for minor errors which can be overlooked since this is the best TV series ever made. I just wish they had all episodes on DVD."
3,"Great show, poor manufacturing","This is one of my favorite shows. I plan to get all seasons, eventually. The low rating is for the poor quality of some episodes. When you pay this kind of money, you expect to be able to watch all the episodes. The last three episodes would not play at all. I returned the set and ordered another. On this set, the last episode would not play at all and the two previous were very troublesome, starting and stopping the whole way through. So, it looks like this is a problem with the dvd producer. So just beware if you buy. I have just started season 2, by Shout Factory and the quality is much better."
3,Why double sided DVDs?,"Universal does it again. As with other sets from them, they use dual sided DVDs, and the only information about the DVD is that 6 point font around the ring in the center. Turn up the lights and squint, maybe you can read it. Most companies use single sided DVDs, with the other side for a full-sized label. So, Universal gets 30 bucks for content that I used to get for free, never mind that maybe you're customers expect something that's collectable. So, it's all about corporate profit. Save a dollar from a million customers, hey, that's a million dollar bonus for the CEO. So, next time record your favorite shows and burn your own CD's. A hand written label with a marking pen is more that you'll get from them."
3,Adam-12,"I eagerly awaited the August 23rd release of Adam-12 and Emergency. I purchased them both and because Emergency was one of my favorite 60's shows, I watched it first and was very pleased with the quality.But, (and isn't there always a but?) I am not impressed with the quality of the DVD's of Adam-12. At one point during the very first disk, the stuttering of the DVD was so bad that I ended up turning the thing off. I haven't had the nerve to check the rest of the DVD's to see if it gets worse. I will check them and though I hate to do it...I will take the boxed set back and refuse to purchase another Universal Classic Television item until this issue gets resolved. I own a lot of ""classic TV"" DVD's and this one was by far the worst in quality.I liked the TV show, Adam-12, but not the product that Universal has obviously thrown out there in order to meet a deadline.Signed, Fed-up Consumer"
4,Great show! Shame on the greedy b******s at Universal!!!!,"This is a wonderful show. And Universal has been pretty consistent with ALL their DVD releases. Consistently BAD! Cheap packaging, high price, low quality double-sided disks, no extras. But at least we can count on NEVER seeing season two! THANKS A LOT UNIVERSAL!!!!Universal needs to take a lesson from Paramount, Sony, etc.To Universal's credit: Cleaning and restoration of these episodes was beautifully done! I only wish Dragnet had gotten the same treatment!"
3,Too Bad It's Universal!,"First off, 8 stars for the show. I've wanted this for years. I have one old Columbia House video tape. This was my favorite show as a kid until Emergency came out. I was 8 when Adam-12 started. I bought Emergency too, BTW. This is great, wholesome entertainment that proves that it doesn't have to have sex and gore to entertain.On the other hand, this set gets the usual Universal short shrift treatment: cheap packaging, no booklet, zero special features, dual-sided disks of questionable quality, etc. Contrast this with all the extras on the Resuce Me DVD set after only one season! Look at the great treament that Paramount gave to The Brady Bunch and Gilligan's Island. Why can't Universal do at least as well?"
3,Very crappy disks of great show !,"I bought this series on DVD over a year ago, but just now got to watch themor at least tried.So far i have gotten to watch 2 episodes and then the disk freezes up.Some disks won't even play at all, so I am stuck with a show I cannot even watch.Maybe I will give it as a Christmas present !**I AM UPDATING MY REVIEW !**I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WATCH THE ENTIRE SEASON 1 ON MY TV THROUGH MY COMPUTER, BUT THEY STILL WILL NOT PLAY ON MY DVD PLAYER."
4,Great Show - So So DVD Quality,"I love this show - why can't they make stuff this clean and of this quality nowadays?! My only complaint is the quality of the DVDs. When they work, they work great, but some do freeze up at times and there seems to be no way to get past it without restarting the DVD...I do hope Universal will work on the quality issue and then put out the remaining seasons of Adam-12."
1,Adam 12 Season One,"When I first read the review on the first season, I turned around to ignore it! But to my displeasure I learned to agree 100% with the first review that Universal made a huge disappointing mistake by not correcting the error of freezing on a good scene.I believe that Universal and Amazon withdraw the sale of the first season of Adam 12 until the problem is corrected. This move would be a good business courtesy to the consumers."
1,DVDs for this product are defective,"Looking forward to seeing Adam 12 again after many years... One dvd would not play at all while the other one would freeze up during the 5th episode. So... I was able to get a replacement product from Amazon(thanks Amazon). The replacement has similiar defects. Certain episodes freeze while others do not play at all. I will be returning the replacement product like the original. Hopefully, getting a refund."
5,Great TV!,"I watched this show when I was a kid. I saw it on Amazon, and bought it. I still think it's a great show, but by today's standards, it may be a bit corny. My son (9 yrs old) loves it. We watch it together. I highly recommend it, and we can't wait for season three!"
1,"Dare I buy this Adam-12 DVD, not if you read carefully.","I have learned to read the reviews of a product before I buy it from Amazon, and from what I have seen here I am right to be wary. Why does Amazon continue to list an item such as Adam-12 that has so many negative reviews. The stars shown I feel are a reflection of the reviewer's love of the series, not of the product that they actually receive. If you don't believe me read the reviews, don't look at the stars. This is a structural problem that Amazon has to deal with. The dichotomy between the passion for the idealized concept of a product and what is actually delivered needs to be addressed."
3,play glitches are the only drawback.,"As someone who was a kid in the late 60's and early 70's I was very excited to find Adam-12 on DVD. Seeing the cover,and hearing that distinctive theme music had me tuned up to enjoy one of my most enjoyed TV memories. At first the shows were everything I hoped for. The picture quality,and sound were top notch giving me several memorable episodes in a row. Then the problems commenced. Freezeups,and pixilization plagued the remainder of this set until I turned away a very dissatisfied customer. I hate that such a great series would be produced to such poor standards,but found this much the same in Emergency season one, and to a lesser extent in Emergency season two. I wonder if this extremely poor quality control is the reason Adam-12 season two has not been released, even after this length of time from season one. This is a missed opportunity for everyone."
4,My experiences,"The order from Amazon was great. It came when it was supposed to.Being an old time Adam-12 fan since it was first on, I was excited that it was finally coming out on D.V.D. I was glad to get my first set. Too bad it didn't last. In the third episode of the first disc, it froze up and wouldn't let me watch that episode. The rest was fine until I got to the last three episodes on disc 2, then it was for all three. This has happened on the two other sets that I have gotten. I'm sure that this is a quality control problem. Hopefully Universal will go to single discs instead of double sided discs for the rest.I enjoy watching the episodes and adding all the deleted scenes and comments makes it worthwhile to own, however, the freeze-ups are a pain."
1,More junk dvds from Universal...,"Love this show and was very happy to get a copy of it. I was dismayed, however, to find that my copy is also defective! Everyone else made it to disc 2 before finding out their disc was bad? I couldn't even make it past disc one! My disc one disc, on side B, freezes up completely when you select episode 4 to play. It won't even let you go back to the menu! Man, I'm steamed! My copy of ""Emergency!"" had a similar problem, and I've had the same problem with other Universal studio tv-dvd releases recently. I'm at the point now of not being willing to purchase anymore Universal tv-dvds because I've had problems with ALL of them and could never get a replacement that actually worked. What's up Universal?!"
5,THE WAIT IS OVER,"A few of my friends-all Rufus&Chaka Khan fans-have been patiently awaiting the arrival of this rare gem and now ""the wait is over."" If you are true die-hard fans of this group, then this CD is a must have for your collection. Just listening to the tracks have taken me back to my high school years. ""Quandary"" is by far my favorite track, but can't help but tap my feet to the upbeat ""Lilah"" and ""Highlight."" And even though this was to be the very last full studio collaboration for the group(a sad day in itself)those of us who remember the times and the music can be grateful that we once again have the chance to embrace and relive one of the greatest R&B/funk groups there ever was."
3,Only Essential For 'Chakaholics'!!,"Well, Chaka was an established solo star at this point, and the only reason she returned to Rufus later in 1981 was to fulfill her contractual obligation with the group. Chaka went through the 'motions' and good material was recorded for this album. 'Better Together' & 'Losers In Love' are great Chaka songs, while a few of the other tracks aren't as impressive. This album is FINALLY available on CD as an expensive Japanese Import (with NO BONUS TRACKS), and that's a shame, but getting a CD-R copy isn't hard these days!! In addition to Chaka Khan, Angela Winbush provides great background vocals. My verdict - ESSENTIAL for Chakaholics!!!Peace, SD(Chakasworld)"
4,"Very good CD,not the best","If you are a fan you will pick this up, but to me it was not the groups best effort, but still a very good cd. The band was going through some issues, and they could not promote this album. It still has some good songs on it. I love the funky Jigsaw, and the slow cuts are great. Chaka still proves she can sing, but u could tell something is missing."
3,"Excellent movie, stupid price","I remember this film from when I was a kid. Why the outrageous price?!?!? Dont be silly. It'll be on DVD soon, so be realistic.Okay. We have another Lovecraftian tale. Not a true adaption by any means, mind you, but a close shave, all the same. It hints at a pre-human earth ruled by evil creatures, who have tried to control modern man with telepathy. That's sure HPL stuff I ever heard it.Aside from having cheesy old-school effects, the story is very strong and most defintely worth a watch.I'd wait until the pirce comes down before buying though."
5,"excellent, well-written, fast-moving","Marvelous detail and plot enhancements, due to years delay between original writing of script and actual start of filming. Keir is superb as Quatermass, and watch out for the full-bodied Barbara Shelley--hot stuff. Powerful and gripping all the way through, with priceless detail. Originally released in the US as ""Five Million Years to Earth"" since American audiences were not familiar with the Quatermass of British TV. In the top 5% of genre. Catch it. END"
1,wako jacko,"This movie has 2 interesting parts1 we were genetically engineered by martian bugs2 supernatural stuff is psionic powers soem have from the upgrade the bugs gave to apesthree things make 0 sense1 why bugs killed each other2 why the ship came to earth, accident?3 why does the ship have humans kill each other?"
1,Wrong Region,"I was really excited when I finally found a copy of this movie. I had looked all over the internet with no success. I waited nearly a month to receive it, but when it finally arrived, it wouldn't play. Apparently DVDs are coded differently in Britain than in the U.S. I'm still trying to figure out how to return it and get my money back. If you order any DVDs online, make sure they're coming from inside your ""region""."
4,The Quatermass,I ordered this video for my husband. He has really enjoyed watching it. He is a big movie buff and knows good movies when he finds them.
4,sticks to your brain,"I can't believe I found this. I watched this film on a Saturday afternoon TV as a child in the early 1970s--5 Million Years to Earth. It intrigued me and scared me more than any other film I have seen before or since. My pre-teen brain was modified permanently by the scene where the evil is released from the spaceship and spreads through the tunnels and then creeps up to the surface. I think this is a great film. Judging from the other reviews, it just may be. I am keen to buy this, watch it, and face my childhood fears."
4,Pretty Darn Good for its Time!,"The first time I saw this movie, was years ago, late at night on television and it scared the, well you know, out of me!The writing is superior and the acting is too. When actors play a monster movie role as though they really believe it, it comes out believable! I like my monster movies to be played seriously, (unless it's meant to be funny, such as MIB), in that way, you can escape into the movie and enjoy it more.Because it's a DATED movie, if you've never seen it before, watch it at night, alone, maybe with a candle on. It'll creep you out, especially all the talk about ""Hobbs Lane"" - and demons.BOO!"
2,"Who are they fooling by claiming that it's 24"" long?","I got it as a larger addition to my smaller but really nice range bag. Amazon states that it's size is 10""x24""x16"". Label on the bag states that it will be the size of the main compartment. But when I measured it - main compartment is only 17"" long and entire bag with side pockets is may be 22"" long. The width is 15"" with pockets, definitely not 16"" for main compartment only. Anyway, don't take my word - just look at the picture that I uploaded.So it's really not much of an addition to an old bag.Also, for the price I expected much higher quality."
3,Misleading...,"This is a generic bag made by a 3rd party and sold to companies with a personalized logo. In the picture provided, it looks like 5.11 didn't even bother with the logo. I have 3 of these (the exact... same... thing) purchased from an online retailer (with their logo) for much, much less than this. This item makes me question other 5.11 items that you and I have likely over-paid for while attaching the 5.11 name to ""quality"".All that said, this is a great bag. Tough as nails and will carry several firearms, eyes, ears, tools, and tons of ammo. I just wish I knew who actually made them so I could just buy from them."
5,Excellent,"High qualty, tons of space. This was given as a gift, and woud consider ordering one for myself. Much much larger than it appears.Delivery was prompt."
4,Carl' sreview of tactical range bag,This is just what I wanted. I was able to get everything I need for the range in the bag and the bag's designed to keep it organized well too. I'm buying another one for a friend who shoots as well.
4,An undiscovered pleasure,"I first heard this band through emusic.com, where this CD and several CD-singles are available for (legal) download. You have a sound that is both soothing and energizing. Lush arrangements complement Peter-Gabriel-esque vocals. Standout tracks are the opening ""The Bugler,"" ""My Friend,"" and ""Don't You Know,"" the last of which appears again on the CD in the form of a 12-minute remix that actually remixes and re-presents the track instead of placing snippits of the vocals over repetitive drum beats. All in all, well worth checking out."
5,This is an excellent account written by a parent,Clara Claiborne had a child with autism born in 1958. In those days autism was considered a purely psychological disorder due to poor parenting. Clara had the sense to reject this dogma and help her child even though the professionals at the time could not do anything for her. This was before the IDEA and other government supports. This book is remarkable for its time and will always be a classic. It totally blows away the garbage spewed out by Bruno Bettelheim and the likes.
4,Very well written parent account,"Some of the vocabulary was long and tedious, but on the whole the story was well written. The struggles when her daughter started insisting on sameness was interesting. I felt like I could be reading my own daughter's future."
2,Someone made a mistake,"This is a good collection to commemorate the drum legend's work. But someone needs to be shot over this track list, he never drummed for the song ""Armed and Ready"", seeing as he didn't join Micheal Schenker's band untill well after that song was recorded.Dude, that was drummed by Simon Philips.These record company retards or who-ever slapped this ""cover"" album togeather needs to do their god-damd research.And you think that band that covered that song for this ""tribute"", supposably being a Powell fan, would of known that."
4,Great....but no master league,"Great game, almost as good as the PS2 version in fact flows a little better. The big downer no Master League and no Cups. Apart from that very good and the best part is you dont have to put up with the terrible commentary thats on the PS2 version."
4,good,They game play is not bad at all. For the soccer lovers this was an economically wise decision if you have a psp system.
3,"Great mechanic, but no broadcast/panormamic views","I agree with the reviews here that the mechanics are excellent. But I cannot get past the fact that there are no broadcast/panormamic views. Bascially, this means that the action can only be viewed close-up and you must rely on dots to see where to pass to a teamate. I like to see more of the field and pass to an actual player, so this really hurts the game in my opinion. Considering FIFA for the DS has these broadcast/panormamic views, there is no excuse why they were lft out of a PSP game."
3,Simple,Okay gameplay but awful as far as the selection of teams. You know a game cant be great if they dont even have 3/4 of the names for the few players included. Dont buy it buy fifa 06 or world cup 2006.
2,Super Granny 3,Great game. I prefer easy games. The only thing that I do not like about the game is that the disk has to be in the computer in order to play the game.
3,which song is...?,does anyone know the name of the song that is playing in ben's apartment when he is making the lamb?? it's kind of reggae sounding and i can't find it anywhere? someone plesae let me know
3,i believe the song was 'don't dream it's over',"if someone hasn't responded to you already, i think the song is 'don't dream it's over', by crowded house. i have no clue who sings it in the commercial, though. hope you see this, or have found out already."
3,That song in the promo,"The song is an old Crowded House song. ""Head out"". I was here looking for it. It sounds like The Sundays, but I'm not sure."
3,Song in Promo (response),"The song you're talking about is by a group named ""Sixpence None the Richer"" and it's off their new album. They're the ones who did the song ""Kiss Me"" for the movie ""She's All That""! Hope this information helps! Enjoy!"
3,reply to the review,"the song in the promo is indeed an 80s cover: ""hey now, hey now"" by crowded house.hope this was helpful.can anyone list the tracks on this CD? thanks!"
2,Title song,"The song that's on the commercial for the movie is ""Don't Dream it's over"" and I remember it was a popular song in the 80's or early 90's. The band that made the movie version is called Sixpence none the richer."
3,It's good but...,"if you're looking for the song from the commercial (""Don't Dream It's Over"", originally by Crowded House) you'll have to look elsewhere. The song in the ad is a cover version by Sixpence None the Richer, from their album Divine Discontent. Some buyers may be disappointed not to find this song included on the soundtrack."
4,Really enjoy this cd.....,"I specifically bought this cd for the song ""Feels Like Home"" and I have really enjoyed listening to the entire cd. I recommend to anyone who likes light rock!"
4,Fun Soundtrack from a Fun Movie,"I really love this soundtrack. It makes a great companion for my spring days in my convertible. My favorite is Follow You Down by Gin Blossoms, but I like almost all of the songs (except for the one by Luce)."
3,first song,the cd is beautiful but what's the name of the first song of the movie? when there are the journals that go around on the screen?the first first of the head-titlesthanx
3,End Song,"Haven't seen the movie, but I think that the song everybody is looking for is Del Amitris ""Roll to Me"" (look around you please, pretty baby)What is the song in the trailer?"
4,Upbeat music making you in the mood for love!,"In response to the question from ""music fan in NY,"" the song featured in the promo is a remake of ""Don't Dream It's Over,"" by Crowded House. Lots of cute music, making you wish you had someone to think about while listening to it!"
3,Trailer Song,"The song in the trailer is a Six Pence None The Richer cover of ""Don't Dream It's Over"" originally by Crowded House."
3,Promo Song,It is a good soundtrack...the promo song is a remake of Crowded House's Don't Dream it's Over - done here by Sixpence None the Richer.
5,Beautiful Music,"""Feels Like Home"" is one of the most beautiful songs I have heard in a long time.To Music Fan from NY - The song in the commercial is ""Don't Dream It's Over"" originally by Crowded House."
4,A Great Soundtrack from a Great Movie,"I thought this movie was so cute and after I saw it I thought how great the music was. It's a compilation of new songs and some classics like ""Let's Stay Together"" by Al Green. In answer to the Music Fan's question, the song from the promo is called ""Don't Dream It's Over"" by Sixpence None the Richer."
4,here's the song name!,"this is to the writer from Gainesville, FL...the song they played when Andie and Ben were in the bathroom is number 3, ""Feels Like Home"" by Chantal Kreviazuk. It's my favorite romantic song...they played it on Dawson's Creek too, i believe. well, hope i helped! :c)"
5,Different music question from a middle aged geek :),Does anyone know the name/artist of the piano instrumental played on the commercials for the movie? Is it on the soundtrack? Thanks!
4,does anyone know?,"i thought that this cd was really great- a good mix, but does anyone know what the name is of the song they played in the bathroom during the shower scene?"
4,End Song,"It is Keith Urban - Love Somebody Like You, that is played at the end when they are riding the motorcycle. However, the one in the movie is a remix, but the one on his CD is still REALLY good"
5,Re:Song in the promo?,"The song is Don't Dream It's Over, by sixpence the richer. It's a cover of Crowded House hit back in the 80's."
2,"hey, ny music fan","I was wondering the same thing. The song is a cover of ""Don't Dream It's Over"" by Crowded House, but I still don't know who the girl is. If you find out, let me know!"
1,Question Answered,"I have not heard this cd but am just answering the question of What's the song played in the promo. It's ""Don't Dream It's Over"" orignally by Crowded House. The girl version in the promo sounds horrible compared to the real version."
3,Name of the song from the trailer,"Name of the song is ""Don't dream it's over"" from the newest ""Sixpence none the richer"" album. Enjoy !"
3,song title,"Its a remake of ""Dont Dream its Over"" by Sixpencenonethericher. Forgot which 80s group did the original but it was a male group"
4,"Great music, but missing something!!!","This Cd has a great mix of music on it, but it is missing the one song I really wanted. In the preview they use Sixpence None the Richer's cover of Crowded House's ""Don't Dream it's Over."" A great song and a great cover, but this does not appear on the soundtack. It's still great though."
2,Don't dream it's over,"Music Fan,the song you talk about is certainly ""don't dream it's over"". It's a song written by the great songwriter Neil Finn from Crowded House and it was released in 1986-87 in the USA.The cover is by Sixpence None The Richer..."
1,Why do they use songs in promos but not on the soundtrack?,"This film has not opened in the UK (where I live) but the trailer has started airing. The song from the trailer, Don't Dream It's Over, written by Neil Finn from Crowded House, is a cover version by Sixpence None the Richer and is available on their album, (I think called divine inspriration or something like that). So if you want that song, find that album.The other songs look like pretty standard fare to me. Kiss Me has been on a dozen soundtracks it seems, as well as the Dawson's Creek soundtrack. Carly Simon jazzes up any album!"
3,Answer to a music fan,"The cover is by Sixpence None The Richer and the original is by Crowded House. The song title is ""Don't Dream It's Over"". Hope this helps. I used my boyfriend's account to post this message. He's the one who actually knows everything! Next time just ask him!"
3,It's A Keeper,The song from the promo is Don't Dream Its Over by Sixpence None the Richer. It's a great show and I love the music. Enjoy.
3,Feel good CD - but short compilation mix,"Here is the low down on the songs, judge for yourself:1. ""Somebody Like You"" [Radio Remix] (Urban, Keith)2. ""Good Day"" (Luce)3. ""Feels Like Home"" (Kreviazuk, Chantal)Have always liked this song, was on Dawson's Creek.4. ""Who Do You Love?"" (Thorogood, George & The Destroyers)5. ""Let's Stay Together"" (Green, Al)6. ""Follow You Down"" (Blossoms, Gin)7. ""You're So Vain"" (Simon, Carly)8. ""Kiss Me"" (Sixpiece None The Richer)9. ""L-O-V-E"" (Fisher)10. ""Catch Me If You Can"" (Beu Sisters)11. ""Weight of the World"" (Kreviazuk, Chantal)"
4,Does anyone know?,Does anyone know the song that they play in the movie close to the end when the guy is riding his motorcycle to try and catch up with the girl? If you could let me know I'd appreciate it! Thanks!
3,She got better with each book she wrote...,"This was her first novel that Jane Heller wrote. I don't think it is her best. I liked it and it read fast. It wasn't as good as her other ones. I loved Sis Boom Bah, and The club, and Princess Charming and especially Name Dropping. That was her best."
2,DISAPPOINTING!,"I have read all of Jane Heller's other books except for ""The Club"" and found this one greatly lacking in both story line and in the author's usual humor. Both seemed very canned to me. I would, however recommend her other books."
4,"Review of ""Cha Cha Cha""","This book is a nice blend of romance and murder mystery, with a touch of comedy thrown in for good measure. It ended in a clever but suspenseful way that I didn't anticipate.I've never read this author before but I was pleasantly surprised by this book. If I have one criticism is that there is some foul language in the book. That's just my personal opinion however as it doesn't bother some people. I just think it isn't necessary to the story-line or the character development."
3,Not as good as I hoped,"Cha Cha Cha first caught my eye because of it's name but I soon found out that it was not as good as I expected. Although the characters are very interesting, the story-line stinks, and the only reason I didn't put it down every five minutes was because the characters' personalities. It took me forever to finish this book. I hope her other books are better and that this book was only a bad first-impression.SORRY JANE !!!!!"
2,Somewhat misleading,"Imagine my surprise when the bowls turned out to be metal with a painted finish. Although nice looking, they are not what they appear to be. I would have described them as a 6 piece small tin set."
4,"nice desk toy, initially smells funny","Like the toy, though I don't think it'd be appropriate for kids. Whatever is off gassing from the product, the figurines particularly, is not something I'd want in my kids mouths.It was a desk toy for me, that I pretty much set up and left for quite awhile before playing with it again... and still, I wash my hands anytime I fiddle with it."
5,Fun kayak bender,"This makes a great gift for kayak lovers out there. Especially the kayak and dog lovers.the dog looks a bit like a mouse, but is still really cute and I think everyone gets the pointfun for all ages."
4,Big watch with big features,"This watch has a lot of great features, if you fly, or want to tell how far off the ground you are in your office this is the watch for you. Your body influences the temperature, so they recommend you take off the watch to use this feature. The compass works great. The barometer is OK. Having analog hands and digital time is cool. This is a toy for most men, and the case is LARGE. Picture a stack of silver dollars and you'll get the picture. This is one of the handicaps in buying something like this on line. All in all a nice toy, but the third party seller should have put more info in their product detail."
1,"No stars, actually First try, froze in closed position","Immediately froze closed. Had to disconnect the battery to keep the starter from burning up. Threw it away. I've had 3 do this in the past. Spend a bit more and get a better brand. I put the old one back on (from 5 years ago) and working fine. Do not recommend, obviously."
4,A lttle retro but still impressive!,"I've owned this VHS tape for years, and every winter I pull it out to fire-up for the ski season The movie has an electrified 80's sound track as the back drop for action packed extreme skiing done by ""R.A.D"" 80's ski hippies. I love the dated 80's teen-speak...it's much cooler than Warren Miller's tiresome narrative and never-ending goofy quips. The straight-cut K2s and the florescent skiwear is a walk down memory lane, but the athleticism and the technical skiing expertise is timeless. I've tried to find the Acid House Audio sound track unsuccessfully. I'm gonna buy another Stump movie and see if I get the same charge out of it!"
5,The Nubuly Coat,"I read this book during my college years although it wasn't a class assignment. This wonderful book has human redemption as its major theme. I think this book should be standard reading for all English majors. Beautifully written, it shows men at their weakest and greatest."
2,not enough to even call it an introduction,"A full third of this book is given over to complex calculations regarding personal directions, which apparently change from year to year. While I suppose this is interesting there is no assistance in applying the result of these calculations. This is a theme carried on through the book. There is not a great deal of information presented and when information is presented there is little in the way of suggestions or advice as to how to apply that information to your particular situation."
3,Feng Shui,the book talks about how to improvev your living standard by instructing you to place certain things in certain places
1,HORRIBLE!!!,"My 5 year old brought this home from her school library. I don't know when it's OK to throw out words like ""evil"" and ""devil"" and then say it sounds like a great idea. If you want to explain to your small child why Halloween is messed up at it's roots, this is the book for you. This is a book I would pick right before I tell my kids that we don't celebrate halloween. Don't let the cute pic's fool you...or your kid."
2,Just Bad :(,"Normally I do not write reviews for games but this one just deserved it. I was excited as hell when this was announced but I got it really later on for only 25 dollars. The game was relatively okay at first till I got to about episode 7 which took me like an hour and a half mainly because Billy has almost no skill other than shooting an arrow. This game would have been great with only the reverand but Billy's sneaking and platforming ruined it. Also there is glitches in the game. I had to do all of episode 9 again(which is the most idiotic level in a game I have played in a while) because it saved while I accidentally fell off of the ledge at the very end. Every time I reloaded it just killed instantly. For only 25 dollars, I gave it a two because I like Westerns otherwise I would avoid it."
2,disappointment,"The controls are terrible (who thinks using a whip is fun??), the story is murky, and the save system makes no sense. Could have been a great or very good game."
2,call of letdown...,"this game was a major letdown, and it seems obvious the developers of the game took no account of how 'Gun' fared, since the games are very similar. this is no sandbox game, much to structured....the game loads about every 6 seconds which makes game play jumpy and non-sequitir, total drag.major dissapoint for me."
2,Bleh...,"I rented this game in the hopes of finding a red dead revolver for the 360...it was a swing and a miss. It's not that the game is terrible, but in no way would the gameplay justify spending 60 dollars. If you are a gamer who just likes to play every new game that comes on the market give it a try, but rent, don't buy."
2,It's No Red Dead Revolver,"I was thrilled a western action shooter was being released on xbox 360 but this is one of the worst western games ever released. Everything about it is disappointing. Graphics, gameplay, weaponry are all below average. Save your time and money. No one should be calling Juarez anytime soon."
3,"Good, but a miss.","This game is definitely the best western game out there... but thats not saying much. The game is very linear, and the gameplay is a little bland. The character models are beautiful, but some of the environments leave a little to the imagination. The best part of the game is easily the concentration draw, but you have very little control over where the cursors move. A lot could have been done to make this game better, but all in all its still pretty good. Voice acting needed some definite work (unless of course they were going for that very corny theme). Now, I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but i dont expect anything amazing.My personal recommendation: rent. if you REALLY like it, buy it."
5,ROH.... Oh yea,"I have never seen a ROH match, but I have read many reviews on the promotion. Seeing Samoa Joe and CM Punk prior to joining the TNA/WWE shows how much they had to go through to get to the big promotions. Of the rest of the wrestlers are no slouch either, but if you want to see wrestlers that are trying to make it big by performing before a few hundred or a few thousand people, slamming, beating, flying, bleeding, chair throwing and just plain entertaining without the ""glare"" of sparkling lights, this is the promotion to watch."
1,Fails to accurately represent the ROH product,"By the looks of it, the ""Bloodstained Honor"" DVD, while certainly entertaining, is a horrible representation of the product that ROH brings to the table on a good 90% of its events. Plan on buying this based on bloodshed and then seeing this at every show? Expect to be let down. Feel free to purchase, but be warned: this is certainly not the typical ROH product, and absolutely not what you should expect to see on their live events."
3,An Easy Read,"I just finished this book, and I found it a very easy read. It only took a afternoon to fly through it. It was a very interesting story line, but I dislike reading about a married woman who finds herself in love with another. If infidelity isn't your thing, this book might not be either."
4,Good price and fast delivery,"Like some of the other reviewers have said, there's not much to say. It's a basic Fram air filter. Only difference is you'll probably pay less than the store, and assuming you buy the cabin filters as well, you'll qualify for free shipping.For the sake of being thorough, the filter I received looked exactly like the picture but orange filter material instead of light yellow. Metal mesh inside and out, black rings top and bottom. The box was in good shape and it didn't seem dusty or anything. Perfect fit on my Honda Element.This filter's fine and it'll get the job done, but I'll probably buy a K&N; filter next time. I bought this filter instead this time since I was already buying a K&N; filter for my other car and didn't want to spend over $100 on air filters. And if you're wondering whether the K&N; filters are worth it, the answer is yes. But if you can't stomach paying $50-$60 for a lifetime filter, this Fram filter won't let you down."
1,Incorrect description,"Description clearly says 2pk, which I take to mean 2 pack. Only one filter was received so either they made a mistake or they lied."
2,Came very slowly,I ordered this book before school started and received it a few weeks after school began. (So it took about a month)It took much too long to deliver but luckily I did not need this book right away.
1,Driver Disaster,"If you are planning on using this to add an additional monitor to your computer and your primary graphics card is a newer Nvidia card: BEWARE!Nvidia's current drivers no longer support this card! attempts to install it's drivers will over-write the drivers for your better card! While the drivers for your newer card will not detect this one.It is imposable to have multiple versions of the same drivers installed at once.However, if your primary card is from ATI this card should work fine for a second screen as the different company's drivers don't overlap.So if you think you are being smart and guarantying compatibility by keeping with the same company: You will get screwed. (or: ""pwn'd"" as the kids would say.)...Another solution would be to use semi-outdated warranty-obliterating ""hacked"" drivers, have fun with THAT! oy."
5,Classic Pickups of the 1950s is a classic!,"This book is chock full of color photos. In my humble opinion, the 50s is the decade when trucks rose to popularity as an alternative domestic vehicle and took the modern form that they still resemble today. This book illustrates that classic era with many popular and also some rare beauties. Photo quality is excellent. I wish I'd have ordered two copies."
3,"It's a great tool, but not a game, really...","I homeschool and bought this for my boys for Christmas thinking it was a game. It is basically a series of cards and a bunch of fraction pieces but there is no game per se. You just use the pieces to fill the cards. It's more like a puzzle. It's a great manipulative, but I was hoping for something a with a little more ""action."" My boys loved it anyway, but I was disappointed. I also gave it 3 stars for durability. The cards are pretty flimsy. I may laminate them if it looks like they are going to get a lot of use."
4,Good Motorcycle oil container.,"Got the drain because its low, with a wide catch funnel and it sides under my bike easy. For this purpose the drain isgreat."
2,Don't expect to do more than 1 car,"PROS: The low height profile is great for sliding under with you.CONS: For the price, the volume of this pan is pretty small compared to other options.The yellow part in the middle is a funnel that attaches to the yellow cap near the handle.The threads are poorly lined up, and it's tough to get in place.Oil that splashes into the center of the pan pools in that recessed hole where the yellow funnel was and makes an annoying mess.Go with other options."
2,Watch out for holes...,"I bought this drain pan due to its low profile in the hopes of not having to jack up my car ('91 MR2). I ended up jacking it up anyway and using jack stands to hold up the car and at that point, the low-profile nature wasn't necessary anymore which was fine. I screwed on the yellow funnel, loosened the drain plug and watched the oil drop straight into the funnel, but then I saw oil coming from the threads!I managed to get most of the oil in the pan but afterwards I looked closely and noticed a hole in the plastic threads on the pan itself, not the yellow funnel. Now I had a huge mess to clean up and will probably only use this pan to transport used oil since you can lay it flat and not be affected by the hole in the nozzle."
2,Overflows almost instantly,I purchased this drain pan after seeing all of the positive reviews on Amazon. The construction quality is actually pretty good so I was hopeful upon opening my package.All hope was lost when I actually used it as a oil drain pan. The opening is too small for fluid to flow down sufficiently and I was left with a substantial oil spill. Huge mistake.DISCLAIMER: My 2006 WRX STI takes full synthetic (which flows a little faster than conventional) but I could easily see conventional oil overflowing as well. The container now functions as an expensive used oil storage bin - so I gave it 2 stars out of fairness.
1,Way too small,They need to list the number of quarts. It's deceiving with all the good reviews but then its barely large enough to hold enough oil for a small SUV. I'd get a larger one unless you own a motorbike. I don't see why anyone would get this for a regular sized car.
2,"useless for me, maybe not for others","I bought this because I liked the idea of not having to transfer oil to another container in order to dispose of it. Unfortunately, the funnel isn't even close to large enough to be of any use to me. My car's drain plug is mounted horizontally, so when I removed the plug, the oil over shot the funnel by a few inches. I had to quickly move the pain under the stream of oil, and had to slide it closer and closer to the drain hole as the crank case emptied. There was also a good amount of splatter. I could see this working OK on a car that has a vertically mounted drain plug (hence the 2 stars), but for me it's more hassle and mess than using a regular, open drain pan and transferring the oil to another container for disposal"
2,"OK, but there are better options for experience mechanics","I bought this a few months back to do an oil change on my lifted 2011 Wrangler. This Oil drain pan works Ok, but the screw on funnel on the side is totally awkward to use. When you inevitably over-shoot the funnel with your engine oil, the center area that is designed to hold the funnel for storage fills up with oil. It's a big pain to clean it up. I've used pans in the past that use the center of the pan to catch the oil as a built in funnel, and those seem to work much better. I wouldn't recommend this for an experienced mechanic that has multiple personal cars to change oil on every few months, because it can be so messy. I like to keep my garage floor and tools clean, and this thing makes a mess when you aren't lined up perfectly. Stick with something with a center drain."
1,Too small,"This is way smaller than it seems in the picture. You'd have a better chance of peeing through a keyhole than placing this silly thing in exactly the right position when you either take out the drain bolt or remove the oil filter. Guess wrong and oil is all over the place. Either get a large open pan, or a container where the whole top surface is used to catch the oil. That thingy-dingy in the middle of the pan is a flying saucer you snap out and screw on to replace the cap. Don't waste your money."
4,Philosopher and Poet,"Any admirer of Barfield's literary ideas will eventually want to see his ideas put into practice. With much of his poetry included, A Barfield Sampler shows his creative side. Besides the shorter lyrics, it also contains some of the most moving verses from Orpheus, and several short stories that give the rare chance to see the young Barfield's attempts to write in a more popular vein."
4,"Mostly enjoyable, would have preferred longer tale.","After recently finishing Stephen Lawhead's ""Byzantium"", I felt slightly disappointed in that thiS STORY should have incorporated a much more elaborate tale. Do try ""Byzantium"" if you find ""Astrid"" enjoyable."
5,Words to ponder... words to enjoy,"In reading a first book by any author, I feel some trepidation. I need not have feared that with this literary work. The stories and associated musings by the author provided myself with an all too brief glimpse into a world that many people should be more aware of. I highly recommend this book and I look forward to his next efforts."
5,David Llewellyn has fine talent!,"I kept hearing songs on the radio that would catch my attention, and each time I checked the artist name - it was David Llewellyn. I had to purchase this CD. I am so glad I did. This performer is not considered ""mainstream"" but provides a mainstream voice and talent level. Sometimes I guess we have to dig deep to find the good stuff. Hidden and well worth finding. Check it out. I can't wait for his next album."
1,NEVER read anything about musashi,"He is too lifted... like a god... who says it's all true what he has done, ok ok... he must have done a lot... but i guess he wasn't the only one around there... he even got beaten too.. is that written in there...Always mushashi this and that... i don't mean disrespect here...But write me another book please about other samurais that time... without upholding the facemask of the japanese !!!Like, what do we know about jinsuke shigenobu... minamoto no yoshimitsu... and lots and lots of others...you won't fool me by telling he did it al by himself..."
3,"Too little of what's needed, and too much of what isn't","Mr.Scott chose to market his book as a biography on Musashi, and with what is there, he does a respectable job. But it's the second half of the book, which is full of fluff regarding Movies on Musashi, a review of the ""Book of 5 Rings"" and other trivia that I found useless and a wasteful fill of pages.The biography itself was decent. It scanned over Musashi's life, but I wasn't expecting better, and provided a rough review of his life. Luckily I picked this book up at the library and didn't waste any money on this book."
5,Exactly what I needed!,"After purchasing an old house that sat empty for several years, there are a lot of things that need to be repaired or replaced. The wooden garage door is in very bad shape right now because leaves sat piled against it for several years. Until I can get to replacing the garage and garage door opener, this was a great solution to seal the bottom of the garage door. It was easy to install with the included nails, and in my case was almost exactly the correct length, so no cutting was required. It's been installed for about a month, and it seems to be holding up fine.The garage is on the to do list for next summer, so for a year long solution, this was perfect!"
3,"Good Product, But without fasteners or instructions",Garage Door was 7 and 1/2 feet wide. Had to shorten product then get fasteners and doublesided tape at hardware store to secure rubber to bottom of metal strip attached to door bottom. It does seal well when door is electronically closed.
4,"Almost a five, but.....","... well, I guess you could say I give it a 4.9. The songs are incredible, but due to the DJ-oriented nature of Trance music, most of the tracks have solid intros, but no real ""end"" to them, just a sudden fade out. This, of course, is so they can be mixed seamlessly into the next song by a DJ, only in this case, they aren't, so it falls just a tad short of perfect. The label it's on also puts out ""Trance Impulse"", which again is exellent but warrants an identical review. I do strongly recommend these two albums (and not one over the other, as they are blissfully interchangeable), but I suggest a good set of headphones over a loud stereo system as the best listening method for them."
3,Trance Lovers,"This CD is a fairly good trance CD. It has that upbeat and soothing sound that trance is known for. However, it can be too repetitive at times."
3,WORTH ITS MONEY,Worth it's money. The cd is overall Ok to me. If you have an extra 13 buck just get the ESSENTIAL IBIZA BOXED SETits better and has a more rave feel.
5,Queen's Best Just Got Better!,"No doubting that this is Queen's best ever album. Both critics and fans agree on this and it's easy to see why. Great songs and great performances from a band of consummate musicians each expert at their chosen craft coming together to make classic track after classic track and the harmonies! Wow! Now this classic, one of the best rock albums of all time comes housed in a gatefold mini-lp replica sleeve that looks very cool and has been remastered in 2001 which makes it sound very good too. Very well worth the price if you are a fan and this is the best sound quality-wise version of this disc that's out there. Highly recommended!"
5,Excellent! Clear instructions with great diagrams.,"This book is an excellent guide for the new or veteran homeowner. It's filled with lots of ideas and a variety of plants including trees, shrubs, perennials, groundcovers and a few annuals. It offers a samples of typical planting scenarios for the home landscaper. Identifying each design as good for sun or shade and showing the variations is one of the best features. Seasonal variations are also helpful. But the best feature is that it clearly diagrams the placement of each plant including distance from the structure and distance from each other. Drawings and actual photographs of plants are also helpful. I highly recommend this book for the new or renovating landscaper."
5,new for old,"just the thing to play my old 78s, and its got enough torque to make cleaning the dirty little buggers easy too."
4,Best turntable I've ever bought,"As far as price performance goes, this table beats everything I've played with. This puppy has the strength of a 1200 or 1210, but with more features. The reverse is a nice little touch. What I really enjoy is the tonearm setup, which allows either an S-shaped or straight tonearm to be fitted. The only qualms I have are that, while it can use an S-shaped tonearm and a target light, these need to be bought separately. Also, the ""slipmat"" that comes with the tables is more rubber and less ""slip"", so it'll have to be replaced (at least, if I start scratching). Of course, considering I didn't have to drop $400 apiece on the tables themsleves, forking over for the extras hurts much less."
1,Possible Function Problem?,"I bought this turntable because my room mate had the Numark T100. When it arrived we set it up exactly how it should be, but for some reason no matter what kind of speaker or audio device we hooked it up to, it wont play sound. You can hear the needle playing the music, but it will not project. Can anyone help.."
5,This was a great book!,This was truly a great book! I enjoyed it and all the other books about gangs. You should read this when you get the chance. And I liked how it talked about the girl gangsters because most of these books are mostly just about the guys in the gangs. We need more books about the girls. I could read it again.
3,VIDEO TAB SOLOS !,"NOT MUCH INSTRUCTION HERE, BUT SOMEONE SHOWING SOME OF MICHAEL SCHENKERS SOLO'S. NOT FROM THE ALBUMS, BUT FROM THE LIVE CONTENT THAT MICHAEL PERFORMS ON THIS DVD."
2,Very disappointing production quality,"I'm not going to rehash all the accolades for the show, other reviewers have done a fine job. Yes, this was a groundbreaking realistic television show, and there are all sorts of groups I'd like to recommend it to, however the actual production quality of these DVDs is dismal. Being overeager, I ordered multiple seasons, and they all suffer from remarkably poor production quality. These discs come dirty, marked, and defective, even though new, with lots of hang up time, pixillation errors, the discs stall and jam, and returning them for exchange is a big waste of time because you will get replacements with the same problems, or even worse. I've noticed this is a problem with two sided DVDs in general."
3,A no frills edition,"A great show from the '70s but this edition is very bare bones. The only ""extra"" is the original pilot episode, which shouldn't be considered an extra IMO.Would it have killed Universal to add a commentary track? Many of the actors and crew are still around and their stories would probably be even more interesting than the series.It's worth the price, but it would have been nice."
5,Who needs the soap opera world of ER,"I was just watching my tapes of Emergency when I found out that it was being released on DVD, well I preordered right away. But I couldn't help but see how Emergency compared to the hype of ER and how much better the show was because it didn't leave us hanging from week to week, and the characters were people who lead clean lives. While yes there was a moral to every ep, and the appliances were avacado and chocolate, the clothes were groovy, it still makes me feel good about the emergency services workers. So sound the claxons. Emergency is back!"
1,Product receives an F for defects!,"This was a ground-breaking series, and is a hallowed production. However, I bought a copy of this season, and the first disc froze on either side on episode 2. After exchanging for another copy, the same problem recurred. Universal should recall all copies and reissue non-defective products. This release gets an F because of the inconvenience and frustration!"
2,"Great show, disc errors","I purchased E! Season 1 through Columbia House and have had issues with four different copies. They all break down in the middle of disc 2, side 1, episode 2 ""Publicity Hound"" then pick back up in the middle of episode 3 ""Weird Wednesday"". All of the other episodes from season 1 play just fine. I will be ordering a copy of E! Season 1 through Amazon when I order E! Season 5 in a couole of weeks. From what I have read in several comments on E! Season 1 here (disc 1 errors), I should be able to come up with a complete Season 1 by combining what I have from Columbia House and Amazon."
5,I LOVE IT!!!,"I ordered the movie for my mom for Christmas.. We watched the entire season in one day. I also ordered with this for my mom the first three seasons. We just finished the first three seasons sunday. So monday I ordered the 4th, 5th, 6th and final rescue. Can't wait!!!"
4,A classic show,This series was groundbreaking in its time and was always one of my favorites. Seeing the episodes 30 years later is fun to watch. The set contains the pilot movie as well as the first season. the individual episodes are still exciting and entertaining today. The stunts are well done and the characters are likable. The stories stand up well and the themes are still relevant today.It was also alot of fun to see the fashions and styles popular then.I couldn't stop watching it!!!
4,Good show,"This is a good quality show, one of my favorites. It shows what our fire and EMS departments go through everyday alng with the docotors who treat us."
1,Universal screws up again...,"Man, this really gets me steamed! Love the show, but Universal, as has become all too frequent lately, can't manufacture a quality dvd that actually works to save their lives! I made it as far as the 2nd episode on side A of disc one, when, not long into the show, the disc starts skipping and then freezes up completely. This has happened to me with other universal tv products and I'm really getting tired of it. I have yet to find a set of their recent tv releases that actually works! No other studio has this problem. What's up, Universal?!"
4,Emergency season one,Thoroughly enjoyed the series as it is a long time since I have seen them and they were as good as I remembered the only disappointment was that it says on each disc side A) and B) but mine only have A) so therefore I only have half of the shows that are listed on the box
5,Good Classic TV show,"My daughters both used to love watching the re-runs of this show, and they missed it a lot when it was pulled from the channel that showed it. I am thrilled to see the DVDs available. ""Emergency"" really details the camaraderie among the fire station crew, and shows a small slice of what life is like for the men and women who risk their lives to fight fires."
3,Overpriced!! This first season is only 11 episodes.,You notice that info isn't listed. At this rate season 2 would be $60. OUCH! It really shouldn't be over $20. I hope they at least include some special features.
4,Emergency Season 1,This is an enjoyable set of the 1st season of emergency!however the dvd quality is poor on a lot of these discs sets.Universal decided to save money by putting these episodes on double sided disc certain episodes will freeze and skip all over the place and finally hard freeze and not play anymore.I finally swapped this and got a good copy where none of the episodes froze but even the [...] is reporting freeze ups on certain episodes so I'm not the only one that had problems this is also happening on Adam 12 and Dragnet I hope Universal won't go cheap and use double sided disc on future Emergency seasons as I'd rather pay more for more disc then for double sided disc.I still recommend this set if you can find a good one.Overall I rate this set a 4 out of 5 for the show but a 3 for the quality of the disc as there is a lot of bad sets out there.
4,Very Pleased and Excited!!!!!!,"I received my set last week (August 24th) I watched it that first night and was very satisfied with the quality and clarity of watching it on DVD. I have some episodes on VHS and have enjoyed them, but to finally have it on DVD is AWESOME!!!!! I was 6 years old when Emergency came out and have loved it ever since. They just don't make shows like that anymore. I can't wait till the next Seasons come out. It's great for all ages to view, my 12 year old son even likes it.Thanks again. Cathy from Fredericksburg, VA USA"
4,Very good - could have been great.,The episodes look good. It brought back lots of memories. Watching the pilot was cool. I don't think I had ever seen how it all got started. The lack of any extras caused a one star deduction.
3,Too Bad It's Universal!,"First off, 8 stars for the show. I've wanted this for years. I have some old Columbia House video tapes. This was my favorite show as a kid, instantly supplanting Adam-12 when it came out (I was 12 at the time). I bought Adam-12 too, BTW. This is great, wholesome entertainment that proves that it doesn't have to have sex and gore to entertain.On the other hand, this set gets the usual Universal short shrift treatment: cheap packaging, no booklet, zero special features, dual-sided disks of questionable quality, etc. Contrast this with all the extras on the Rescue Me DVD set after only one season! Look at the great treament that Paramount gave to The Brady Bunch and Gilligan's Island. Why can't Universal do at least as well?"
3,I Also Have A Problem With A Bad Disc Locking Up My DVD Players!,First off I want to say that Emergency is my favorite 1970's era television show and when I got a gift certificate for my birthday I used it to buy the first season on DVD and like other reviewers I have had a problem with a defective disc! The defect is on side 2 of disc disc #1 and it locks up our DVD players. We have 3 DVD players and the disc will not play right on any of them. (And one of them is a high end DVD player!) I can not bring this back to the store I got it from because I no longer have the receit and the time for returns is over. I tried to go to Universal's web sites to see if I could contact them to replace the disc but I have a very old computer with an old browser that won't work with Universal's web sites so does anyone know how I can get in contact with them? All I really want them to do is offer me a replacement for the one bad disc. I really can't afford to buy a whole new set!
3,"Great series, but lousy DVD quality.","I'm really happy to finally see this series available on DVD. Despite the cheesy acting, cliche dialogue, and medical inaccuracies, this remains one of my favorite TV programs. It was groundbreaking for its time and one of the reasons I went into the medical profession. It's a shame that Universal Studios has put together such a cheaply done DVD set. No extras as all, 2 sided discs with only 3 episodes per side, cheap graphics. This series deserves a better presentation."
1,Damaged DVD's!!!!,"I couldn't wait for Emergency! to arrive on DVD. I have now been through 2 sets and both freeze, pixulate/scramble on all my DVD players. Are there any good copies of this series? I am extremely disappointed."
4,Excellent single,"Four Chords That Made a Million is a good song, but it's probably one of the wekaer tracks on its parent CD, Lightbulb Sun. The b-sides are excellent, however, and one wonders how they were left off of the CD.All in all, an excellent single."
4,Halo,"""4 chords.."" is my favorite track on Porcupine Tree's new album ""Lightbulb sun"". This song manages to be both catchy and intricate at the same time, and it's a very intriguing mix of art-pop and progressive rock with an avant-garde touch. I love this sort of soaring, fuzzy guitar riffs, it reminds me of Main's output, particularly ""Hydra-Calm"" and ""Dry stone feed"". The two non-album tracks are good but nothing to get too awfully excited about. ""Disappear"" features acoustic guitars, and ""In formaldehyde"" has a delicate, romantic melody. All in all, this 12 1/2-minute CD-single is a worthwhile addition to the album. There are also several other editions of ""4 chords.."" available; the vinyl single, for example, contains another non-album track (""Orchidia"")."
4,No Real Surprises Here,"Ok, before I even thought of buying Amanda Marshall's Tuesday CD I came across this single. I must tell you, for anyone who loves meaningful ballads and a sultry voice. This is for you.Though I do admit the first time I heard the opening notes, and heard whistling I was a bit taking aback, it just didn't sound good at all. But the more I listened to the whole song, the more I liked it.Though it's a bit disapointing to see Dark Hourse on there. The other songs make up for it completely.All in all this single is really worth the money."
1,Disappointed,The book was a disappointment as the description fails to state and emphasize that the majority of recipies require a rice cooker equiped with Fuzzy Logic.
3,"Love the recipes, but no index :(","This book has excellent recipes with a ton of variety, but no index! There is a short table of contents, but to view a listing of the recipes you have to go to each section in the book. Moreover, there is no index in the back of the book. For me, the index is a must in a good cook book! I want to look up recipes by ingredients I the have in my kitchen, by recipes I have used in the past, or just for creative thought/ideas. This book lacks a key component of a good cookbook.Other than that, excellent recipes and easy to follow, but I had to mark down 2 stars for the lack of main recipe listing and/or index.July 27, 2012 update: the version I have reviewed is an 'Uncorrected Bound Galley' copy."
3,Good information on rice but not what I wanted for receipes,"I purchased this cookbook in combination with my rice cooker. My experience with rice cookers had been limited and wanted to expand my usage beyond just steaming rice. I had been taught to steam rice in a saucepan and had only started using a rice steamer at the suggestion of my son.So, I used his for a period of time and had to purchase my own. As soon as it arrived, I immediately prepared the steamer for use and opened up the cookbook. The information on the different forms of rice was great, but the receipes included did not meet my needs. I do not recommend this cookbook if you are looking for clear and informative receipes and needing photographs to imagine what the finished product looks like. For me, photos also gives me an idea of whether or not it might be something I want to use."
3,Echoing the complaints about the type color,"I love this cookbook. The recipes are not overly complicated, but they are good enough that I would happily serve them to company. The variety is tremendous. The breakfast foods alone make it worth the price, in my opinion. However, I hate to *read* this cookbook, because the type is so light in comparison to the page, that it's extremely difficult (and that's in my well-lighted kitchen!) I really have trouble with the orange type in particular. (The ingredients are generally given in orange type.) Plus, I worry that the type is going to fade even more over time. I like the book so much I've even thought about buying it for my Kindle, but Kindle has its own problems converting lists and graphs, so I've avoided doing that for now."
3,"great book, BUT quite hard to read!","I think this is an excellent cookbook. I really learned a lot from the explanations of the various types of rice and how they should be handled and cooked. I have used many of the recipes already and have really enjoyed them. My big complaint is the printing - it is ridiculous to print a book using greenish ink on an off-white-beige-ish page. I cannot sit comfortably and read this book for any length of time, as it's just too annoying to read. Why on earth did they do this? If it was to be ""green"" well I am all for being ""green"" but not at the expense of not even being able to read the print on the page, especially at night when the light is dimmer. PLEASE publisher, put this book out in its next edition with black ink on a white page."
3,Not for those with cheap rice cookers,"I was eager to try out this cookbook because I own a rice cooker and wanted to use it for more than just cooking rice for an occasional stir fry dish. When I received the cookbook, I was disappointed to find that most of the recipes required a rice cooker with settings other than ""On"" and ""Off"" like the rice cooker I currently own. Since I'm not ready to go out and buy another, more expensive rice cooker right now, I'll have to wait to try most of the recipes. I just wish the description of the cookbook would have included this information."
2,dim print,"The information in this cookbook is useful, but the design of the book makes it difficult to use. The pale print is painful to read, especially when you are trying to work with it in the kitchen. I would not have bought this book if I had looked at it first. I hope they bring out an edition with darker, more accessible print"
3,Ok but kinda vague,"Bought this cookbook due to good reviews and theres not many out there. It has some ok recipes, but ingredients are not handy, and who wants to search at several stores. Some things are talked about such as mixes that come out well, but no instructions on how they were cooked. I would buy again but mostly just for ideas not recipes. (a few pictures would be nice also).Too bad more books have not been written."
2,"Don't buy unless your cooker is a ""fuzzy logic"" one","After reading all the reviews of this cookbook, I decided to purchase it. I've been looking for a good rice pudding recipe to be made in a rice cooker.However, the book is nearly useless to me. Every single recipe in the pudding section calls for using a ""fuzzy logic only"" cooker. I checked the oatmeal and porridge section as well -- and found the same.So, it might be a good cookbook for people who own $200 rice cookers, but for the majority of us, the book is just not worth it. There are too few recipes for regular old rice cookers.(And I find it disingenuous that, when the authors talk about the differences in cookers in the beginning, they fail to note that the majority of their recipes only work in the expensive machine.)"
5,"If you use a rice cooker, this book is very helpful.","I have been using a rice cooker at least 3x/week for over 16 years, but only to make white rice. I bought this cookbook so that I could explore other ways to use this ""must-have"" kitchen appliance. I think the book is well worth the price, even if you don't own a ""fuzzy logic"" rice cooker. There are not too many recipes that call for ""fuzzy logic"" cookers only. Most recipes can be done with either the ""on/off"" type (like I have) or the ""fuzzy logic"" type."
3,good reference for rice cookers,"Good book for quick reference and finding something a little different to cook in a rice cooker. I collect cookbooks, so this one is one of many, but I do use it."
3,Good recipes but horrible typeface,"This cookbook has much more than good recipes---lots on rice history and culture. However, the print is small and is either light brown or orange---VERY hard to read. Every time I pick up the book, I end up putting it down in frustration because I have so much trouble reading it. I don't know how much use it will actually get because of this.Also, it's not very useful for my particupar rice cooker, which is a George Foreman Multicooker, because the cycles don't match the ones referenced in the cookbook. I will probably use the cookbook mostly for ideas for quantities and seasonings."
3,A little impractical,"I absolutely love all of Beth Hensperger's bread cookbooks, however this book is a bit impractical. Some recipes require two rice cookers, and most others require a programmable rice cooker. There are plenty of great recipes (tips) for making great rice and rice-like side dishes, and those that are applicable for my simple on/off rice cooker are nice to have on hand. Perhaps someday I'll get a programmable rice cooker (fuzzy logic with porridge setting), and I'll be able to try some of these recipes, but for now, I guess I just have to make rice."
2,Want a great cookbook full of pictures? Not here :(,"I bought an amazing rice cooker not too long ago (check my other reviews), and decided that I wanted to use it for more than just rice. On a whim, I chose this one. After all, it was ""The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook"".I can't honestly give the recipes in this book a review, as I have yet to actually try any of them. But ""Why"", you ask? Well, although there are a large number of recipes in the book, not a single one contains any pictures. And really, who wants a cookbook without picture and who wants to make something without having any idea of what they are making?I know I like to flip through a cookbook and say, ""Oh that one looks good. Let's try that."" But this is NOT a cookbook. This is a recipe book.So, if that's the kind of experience you are hoping to have with a cookbook, you really need to look elsewhere.."
5,Great product,"Fast ship and great product, can't wait to find time to actually cook some of the recipes"
2,Disappointed,"I guess I expected magic. I looked at the puddings and thought this new fuzzy logic could make it happen. I BOUGHT a Fuzzy logic along with the recipe book. The pudding was so awful. The Fuzzy logic makes great rice, but so does my $20 rice cooker.I also bought the Fuzzy logic because of the pasta recipes---I guess I thought the noodles steamed to perfection. Anyway, this is my fault for not reading more carefully because you just put the noodles in water in the cooker and let them boil and steam whatever on top.I will come back and update this if I come across a fabulous recipe. I just had my heart set on being able to make great pudding. So, I was disappointed."
4,Cookbook is a Big Help,"I haven't tried anything except rice dishes so far, but I think the cookbook is a great value. It gave me a lot of ideas for recipes I can make. I would buy the cookbook if I were getting the cooker."
3,Rice Cooker 250 no fail recipes,"It's ok ,I like a recipe book with pictures, you know what your fixing is suppose to look like, recipes are ok. If you have a rice cooker and can't find the recipe book that came with it, it comes in handy."
2,"Not worth it, buy some other book or Google for recipes","This book is really not worth it, and it is rather annoying. Others complain about the hard-to-read print, which doesn't help, but I just find the authors' tone very off-putting. ""Be sure to use currants, not raisins; raisins are too big."" Too big for what? My mouth?You'll find there are relatively few recipes you can make unless you have 2 rice cookers--one fuzzy logic cooker, and one on/off cooker. Many recipes work with only 1 kind of cooker, so you can forget about the recipes that are not compatible with your machine. At least one recipe actually calls for 2 rice cookers! How many of us own two? I only have one fuzzy logic machine, alas.The recipes themselves are merely OK. I really wanted more bean recipes, there are hardly any in this book.I found I can Google for rice cooker recipes and turn up much better ones, even an online cookbook that looks good."
1,No Pictures,"I was very disappointed in this book. We eat with our eyes first, so before I try a new recipe I want to see how the finished product will look. Since there were no pictures, I didn't have a clue how it should look. I would have not purchased this book if I had known."
3,Rice Cookbook,I wish I could tell you that I just love the book but am sorry to say it was disappointing. The layout is hard to follow but trying to read the print is frustrating. It is colored in a fine light green and pale orange print that makes it very difficult to see. If you have any eye condition at all you may want to consider a cookbook in different colors.
3,not quite right for my taste buds,"I agree with other reviewers that there is really good info about rice and grains. However, the recipes seemed to be sweet/savory which I tried but didn't enjoy. The recipes also seemed to focus mostly on using white rice which I try to avoid. Unless I missed it, there wasn't a strategy provided for making the dish with brown instead. But, I did buy this when I bought my first rice cooker so I have to admit that it did help to give a baseline of knowledge."
4,New Addition to the Home Cook's Bookshelf,"The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook celebrates the versatility of the rice cooker in contemporary American kitchens. The recipes themselves are easy to follow and will be appreciated by the novice and gourmet alike. In the process, previous thoughts about the limitations of this machine or rice itself are happily dispatched with and replaced with savory and sweet options to be introduced to the menu of homes from Montana to Maine. Enjoy!"
5,Love this book!,"So how many ways CAN you cook rice? Well this book attempts to answer that age old adage. Ok, so maybe its not an age old adage, but as vegetarians we often get bored of our old tried and true five or so recipes.We bought this book to use with ourZojirushi NS-TGC10 Micom 5-1/2-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer, Stainless Steel. Sofar we have done 6 recipes out of this book. Each and every recipe was tasty and made simple rice something more.If rice is a staple of your diet I cannot think of a better book to use on a weekly or daily basis.Summary:Easy to follow recipes, some good pictures all help to make this a great recipe book.Thank you for reading my review."
3,Not What I Expected,"This has some nice recipes but there are some things you do have to cook outside of the rice cooker (they're not a one-pot dealio) and many of the recipes have more ingredients than I'm willing to reach for - so not very quick and convenient. Otherwise, as long as you're not expecting it to be a ""quick and easy"" cookbook, this one's for you if you're a rice fan."
2,the ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook,"Almost everything in this book is for a 6-cup cooker. I have a 3-cup cooker. Also, most recipes require your attention--add this, stir that--you don't just mix, put the top on, and then eat. In my opinion, the recipes require far too much effort. I can make most of the recipes easier on the stovetop or in the microwave! I think the only thing you should plan on cooking in your rice maker is RICE, plain and simple. Except if you have one of the fancier models that makes porridge, then you can cook steel-cut Irish oatmeal easily (in fact, this is the main reason I bought my singing Zojirushi rice maker).VISIT MY BLOG: [...]"
4,Rice cooker,"The cooker is the right size for two people, which I wanted. However, I was disappointed that there were absolutely no recipes or directions for even the most basic of rice recipes. I had to experiment with a couple of batches before I got it right. The cooker works well and cooks the rice in the same amount of time it would take on the stove, but without watching it."
2,Complicated Cooking,"Why I don't like this cookbook:1. Too many ingredients that are not available: I live in a small town with one grocery store. You need an Asian market next-door to make half the recipes2. High in fat: Veggie recipes to feed four start with six tablespoons of butter. Chicken marinades have a cup of oil.3. No nutrition information4. Assumes everyone has two steamer trays5. Complicated recipes where you need to cook in four phases and use food processors, blenders, etc."
2,somewhat dissapointed,"I have one of the fuzzy logic rice cookers and was hoping for a cookbook that has lots of one pot meals with or without rice. This book for most part not the book I was looking for. Book gives great background on different types of rice and cookers but most of the recipes are for just rice as side dish not the full meal. There were only a handful one pot meal I found I am actually going to try. So if you are looking to make rice 1000 different ways than maybe this book is for you. IF you are looking to explore other things your rice cooker can do I like better Katie Chin's book ""300 best rice cooker recipes"""
3,Best for fancy rice cookers,"If you have a computerized rice cooker, you'll probably get a lot of value from this book. If, however, you have a simple rice cooker (non-computerized) then you'll find very few usable recipes."
2,Do NOT Buy - Unless you have FUZZY LOGIC COOKER,"There are a few recipes here and there for what the author calls 'Off/On"" rice cookers. But the majority of the recipes are for FUZZY LOGIC."
3,best for fuzzy logic rice cookers,"It should be noted by people who already have a rice cooker and are not planning to buy another one soon, that many or most of these recipes are for a ""fuzzy logic"" rice cooker. I read several of the recipes, and they sound very tasty, but I can't really use them in my rice cooker. I think they can probably be easily adapted to be cooked on the stovetop or in the oven as one-pot meals."
5,Didn't get to use yet as my rice cooker sucks,I got the wolfgang puck rice cooker and its a POS so I have not been able to use this yet. I will re-review later.
2,Meh,"Good recipes but almost impossible to find a specific one. There's a Table of Contents, but not to specific recipes. There's an Index but you can't use it to find recipes.I ended up getting frustrated and returned it for a refund."
2,"not bad, but not really necessary","This cookbook isn't the best, but it's not the worst either.I definitely do NOT think it is required reading if you own a rice cooker. Most of the stuff they mention is A) common sense, and B) depends on your exact rice cooker, so they can only tell you in general what to do.I find myself rarely looking at it. I find the writing style annoying - the authors gush endlessly about how rice cookers must have fallen from heaven. That combined with generic, common sense recommendations, does not make for a useful read."
2,kind of defeats the purpose,"Disappointing. Most of the interesting recipes require a fancier rice cooker than I own, and have you stirring stuff in the pot for longer than I have the patience for. It kind of defeats the purpose. I just want to throw stuff in the pot and press the button."
2,VERY dissappointed!,"After all the reviews touting this book and its' wonderful recipes I had to try it. Sorry I did. The color of the printing makes it difficult at times to read. The recipes do not entice me to even want to try them. I did try the rice pancakes and ended up discarding the batter and would not make again.Conversely, I have made several of the recipes out of Debra Murray's book for Wolfgang Puck's rice cooker. Those recipes are easy and scrumptious. Just made the Split Pea soup last night and thoroughly enjoyed it.I just don't get all the hype on this book - oh well..."
3,With a 3cup cooker.. do the math..,Nice cookbook.. plenty of recipes crafted to fit the rice cooker. The only problem is they are all for 6 or 10 cup ricecookers. If you have a small one.. you will have to do the math.
4,Useful Book,I got this book to go with my new rice cooker. There are many interesting recipes and lots of information of the different varieties of rice. I thought it was useful.
3,The Ultimate Rice cooker Cookbook,"This cook book has extensive histories of rice and other suggested grains; good for the historian, bit much for this cook! Recipes, once you get to them are fine. I'd ordered another rice-cooker book at the same time, one aimed at students -- which I found to be handier and easier to use."
5,A must if you own a Rice Cooker,"After buying a Zojirushi NS-ZAC 10 rice cooker, I knew I had to buy this book. I'd checked it out from the library but there are simply too many good recipes that I had to buy it. This is the bible for anyone owning a rice cooker. Only problem is it has recipes for both fuzzy logic and on/off type machines and now I find myself wishing I had both so I could try more recipes!"
4,You don't have to have a Fuzzy Logic rice cooker to use this book!,"I was very excited to find this book, only to discover that there's a whole chapter where the authors vociferously claim that you can't cook porridge or puddings in a basic, no-frills rice cooker.This is not true. I have cooked rice pudding, oatmeal, porridge, and lots of other 'impossible' items in my $12 Rival 6-cup rice cooker without any problems.There is one trick, though: You have to remove the lid while it is cooking or it will boil over.You would think that this would mean the rice or oatmeal or whatever wouldn't get cooked properly, but it works just fine.Just thought someone might be interested in the tip, just in case you were looking at this book and wondering if you could use it with your more reasonably priced rice cooker. :)"
3,Am I missing something?,"Maybe my Zoji neurofuzzy (NS-ZCC10) is defective, but I can't do with it what these authors say I should be able to do.1. They say I can make polenta by running two sequential porridge cycles. However, I get an error code when I try to do this. I have to allow rice cooker to cool down first, before running a second cycle. (BTW, one porridge seemed PLENTY for the polenta. It was very good!)2. When I try to saute onions in the pan for pilaf, the pan never seems to get hot enough before it turns off, then I can't go back and run a rice cycle till the unit cools down again!Maybe the neurofuzzy is really too ""sophisticated"" for some of the tricks these authors use."
5,"If you have a rice cooker, you need this book","The ultimate book for use with a rice cooker. Goes from the basic types of cookers all the way to the newer neuro fuzzy logic beasts. The authors have covered just about everything you would ever want to know about the cookers, about rice and about the wide range of dishes you can make with the rice cooker.A good read as well as a practical guide!"
3,Nice,"The reciepes were just as I expected... even more..., the book's price is great too, but it should have some pictures!!!"
2,Not what I was expecting....,Was looking for simple basic recipies... found lots of exotic stuff that I would never make. If that's what you want this cookbook is not for you.
4,Rice cooking,A good book that could use an index. Instructions work well and is fun to read as well as cook with.
5,Great Book !,"After reading the reviews, I didnt know what to think but I bought it anyways and Im glad that I did. Yes, you do learn about Rice itself, but I thought that was very interesting and made me appreciate my rice cooker alot more.It also helped me to understand how the different varieties of rice cook. I tried some recipes from the book and they were very good! Yes, there are recipes that you have to have a specific rice cooker for. I have the 10 cup capacity with no poridge setting but I found alot of recipes I can adjust that are for the 6 cup capacity. The only thing I cant make are the recipes for poridge/oatmeal. Thats not a huge deal to me as there are so many recipes to choose from. The book was also very resonably priced. I love my rice cooker!"
5,My wife wanted this...,"as a replacement to the one she lost. I was skeptical, but I have to admit it has some killer dishes that are blindingly simple to make.I love the Vitner rice."
2,Disappointed,"I ordered this book after my recent purchase of a rice cooker and was very much looking forward to trying the great sounding recipes. I was so disappointed when I opened the book and saw the print. It is printed in a light olive green print and a light orange print, both of which are drab and faded looking. Maybe it's just me, but I kind of like to see the recipe I'm trying to make. If this book had black or a much darker print that was easy to see, I'm sure I would have liked it. Unfortunately, I found the print annoying enough to return it."
2,Almost unreadable print,"I bought this book in 2008 but have used only four or five of the recipes. It's just too hard to read. Granted my senior vision isn't the best, but it's just TOO annoying to have to rearrange lighting in our kitchen in order to throw various items into our rice cooker. If I EVER buy ANY book with such idiosyncratic ""artistic"" production as this one, it will be returned forthwith."
3,"SCREW ME, SCREW YOU!","The cat was let out of the bag that this movie was nothing but a giant put-on. How else do you explain a guy with Academy Award nominations (not to mention other awards)under his belt to one day wake up and renounce the world that made him? Evil Roman in Gladiator to brooding crooner in Walk the Line, you know Joaquin Phoenix is no joke in the acting department. Didn't anyone see this coming? HE'S AN ACTOR! HE'S PLAYING-ACTING HERE! I mean, come on, a RAPPER? Give up the fame and limelights so he can build up a half-ass career in rap? That alone's an insult to rappers everywhere. No surprise Sean Coombs (P Diddy, cameo) lets him down easy and tells him he's not ready to record with him. This crazy concoction directed by Casy Affleck is strangely entertaining (if only because you literally can not believe what you're seeing). If you don't mind watching a fat, crazy, coke-snorter piss his career down the toilet (yeah, right), then this documentary may be for you."
5,Post-Modernism At Its Finest,"This film first and foremost is definitely not for everyone, its not really for most people actually. I watched it in a contemporary film theory class and having done the post-modernist readings before hand I personally was completely sucked in. I have always been a big fan of post-modernism and found this portrayal to be incredibly insightful and a huge opportunity for debate and reflection on our society and its addiction to celebrity culture. I personally think there's a great dichotomy present in this film between the staged mock-umentary of Phoenix's life pursuing a career as a rapper and the ""real"" Phoenix as he has to be realizing what this film will do to him as a person and actor in a very fake town. I would recommend reading up on post-modernism before watching it to appreciate it better but like I said this film is definitely not for most people."
2,Not Real Yeah Right!,I have spent too much time around drunks to think this is a mocumentary. I will bet he does not come out of the gutter again. If he does it will be years of rehab.
4,pure brilliance...... if you see it for what it is.,"The people who wrote bad reviews just didn't get it. It was Joaquin's owed to Mr Andy Kaufman why, well he got you people to watch it didn't he and that was his point for the public to watch it and say what the_____ is this supposed to be. The joke was for him and Mr Casey to enjoy just like Kaufman did. It was pure brilliance!"
5,Filmmaking in VERY rare form,An exceptional study on the disgusting underbelly of celebrity pop-culture. Joaquin Pheonix's performance and talent on display here is unlike ANYTHING in film history. The fact that he did not even get an Oscar nomination for his uncanny dedication to this role further proves that the Academy Awards is nothing but a popularity contest. Seek this one out if your looking for a film with something real to say about us.
1,Meltdown,"Looks like a meltdown to me. If you like watching meltdowns of someone who once was a great actor, this is it. Still, I hope someday he solves his problems and returns to film."
3,A reality-TV movie...,"...and it probably succeeds on that level, showcasing how tabloid rags, and even corporate-owned news media, can create celebrity out of nothing: Anna Nicole Smith, Paris Hilton, Dr. Phil, Jon and Kate Gosselin, Kim Kardashian, Paula Dean, Sarah and Bristol Palin, Levi Johnston - the list goes on and on. This fake live-cam of Joaquin Phoenix is like spending the night at a meth party, and is more stupid than funny. Casey Affleck is a little late trying to sell this kind of thing - Sacha Baron Cohen has already milked it to the max (and with far more humor). The sublime intellectuality of the hip-hop biz, and some raunchy and grotesque bits, are the definite highlights."
1,"should have been called ""What's the point?""",This movie has no redeeming qualities or comedic value. Only tweekers and stoners will find any value in this. Who would go all-out and risk personal ruin to make this trash?! This is what Phoenix damaged his career two plus years for?! Maybe he just wanted an excuse to pig out and get baked for awhile. There is no value to the acting. The story is all over the place. The rapping is neither good nor funny. It's about as fun as stomping on a flaming bag of dookie.
5,Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain,"Played like a fiddle???? Yes i eventually fell for it too...There doesn't really need to be much of a back story on the events leading up to this film....many will psychoanalyze every aspect of this thing...Entertainment or not.What makes this movie so good is that because of the build up & conflicts between what's real and whats faked, it's hard to tell exactly that...What's real, what's scripted...When is Joaquin acting or being real...Is it natural or ""elevated"" acting...This is my first run through the movie, so i have yet to listen to the commentaries for further insight...I'm not much of a star chaser so i don't really know what Phoenix has been up to since or what maybe coming up for him...But like the movie or not...You have to give him a lot of respect for doing something like this that may or may NOT tarnish his career and/or cast a world of judgment on him...."
1,too difficult to watch.,"Mockumentary or documentary.......It plays like a sadistic home video of a life spiralling down the drain. Part Jackass,part Sid and Nancy......only you were able to sit thru these two."
2,Hmm...,"I saw this when it came out a couple years ago & sort of enjoyed it. I'm pretty sure I was still on hard drugs at the time which would explain me liking it all & I felt like there was no way it could be real,then watched the special features where it's revealed it's all a joke or a role...either way, it had enough of an impact to make me not care about this guy at all anymore & avoid any movies he's starring in ever since. I don't think that's the affect they wanted it to have on people with this experiment / mockucomedrama but whatever the hell it's intentions were & whether it was mostly real & partly staged or partly real,mostly staged,i don't know but it succeeded well enough in making me not like this guy at all . Some of it may be just be the association with casey affleck who i never cared for to begin with but mostly this one's all on jaoquin ."
1,Sad little man.,"I think Joaquin Phoenix is a very talented actor, loved him in Parenthood, To Die For, Walk the Line, and Two Lovers. But this mockumentary is awful from beginning to end. The ""real"" Joaquin is abrasive, self-indulgent, and highly annoying. I couldn't stand this film, there's no point to it whatsoever! The David Letterman interview is hilarious but overall, I'm Still Here is the biggest letdown of 2010."
1,What a Wasted Life,"This is such a sad story, to see such a talented man trying to find himself in sex,drugs and bizarre behavior. He needs to get a wakeup call before he goes the way of his brother, and learn to live the life of a plain man without abusing his body, to save himself. Nothing but tragedy in this film, I wish him all the best."
4,Maybe a grain of salt is what's called for.,"It seems to me Joaquin has succeeded in ""punking"" an entire population of movie goers. He sure had me fooled. That, in my opinion, is the mark of what makes someone an exceptional actor, to be so convincing with their performance that people are still wondering ""What the..."" Some people think Joaquin may have lost it and they are entitled to their opinions. I however don't think that's the case. I think Joaquin tried his hand at playing a character so totally different from any he'd played in the past--and succeeded in playing that character from the sound of it--I also think maybe he just wanted to have a little fun, and play a character that wasn't as serious as some of the others he'd played. In that case, I think the movie should be taken at face value, as well as with a grain of salt."
3,"Good information, but...","The book contains good information on the causes of hair loss and some types of treatments, however I was more interested in NATURAL hair loss solutions which would not be considered the strongest subject information of this book."
4,Takes me back... and makes me smile!,Just pop in disc 1... select track 7... Spandau Ballet - True. It brings back memories of too much moose in my teenage hair and trying to get the chick in the neon green top to notice me. Enjoy!
5,Best book on solar eclipses!,"""Totality"" is a superior reference providing a very comprehensive coverage of solar eclipses. I highly recommend this book for advice on understanding, enjoying, photographing, and experiencing solar eclipses, especially total solar eclipses. The information provided is easy to understand as well as practical and useful. I have about a dozen books on eclipses and this is one is the best. ""Totality"" is a must read for anyone preparing to experience a solar eclipse."
5,Solved my Italian Wedding Music problem,"This CD solved all my problems in recreating a traditional Italian wedding reception for my family. As first generation, Sicilian, we wanted to salute our heritage and present all the traditional parts of the wedding. The CD ""how to guide"" made that so easy. The DJ followed the tracks perfectly and there was not a dry eye in the banquet hall.In fact, another one of my dear friends is using the CD for her wedding in June.I recommend this to all Italian Americans and those who wish they were!Francesca Spinal"
5,Mama mia! Que autentico!!,"I buy this CD for my sister, Teresa who must to have a wedding so traditional like mine in our home town of Palermo. Very thank you to Roman Holiday CD! The wedding of Teresa will be remember forever! Everybody love the happy, autentic music of my country!"
4,"Worth Purchasing, But With The Following Reservations...","This is a crisp, clever, and unique Italian Wedding Album that will definitely add some energy to any wedding, which is why I gave it four stars, but with some reservations. First, my CD arrived with a flaw. The Bridal Entrance (Track 17) would not play properly, but strangely enough...it was repeated again in its entirety on a hidden Track 18. So now I must remember to skip track 17 if I choose to play this song on cue. Secondly, although the CD offers some of the most exciting versions of Italian Wedding Songs I have heard along with some rare treats, a few of songs fall short. For example, I would recommend playing the Dean Martin version of ""That's Amore"" and the Emeralds version of ""The Chicken Dance"" over the versions that appear on the album. And finally, it is important to note that some of these songs are sung completely in Italian, which could be awkward for any guests who do not speak the language."
1,Still waiting,I am still waiting for this product to arrive. It has been months since I first ordered it. Very disappointed.
1,Read the fine print,"Being born and raised in America with Italian parents,this cd was not for me. If I had known that some nobody was singing these great songs I would have never bought it. Where are Connie Francis, Loui Primo, Dean Martin, Rosemary Clooney, Jerry Vale? These songs where butchered by these people who can't sing! I won't embaress my family by playing this at my wedding."
1,Impossible to read on Pocket PC,"If you are contemplating buying this book for use on a handheld, save your money. It is absolutely worthless. I'm not referring to the content, but the format makes it impossible to actually read.The book is in .PDF format, and is viewed with the included Adobe Acrobat for Pocket PC. The problem is that if the text is large enough to read, only a small portion of the page is visible, and you need to scroll all over the page in order to read the content. If you zoom out to see the entire page, the text is too small to read."
1,A big disappointment,The writers style needs refining. It reminded me of a cross between The Outermost House and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. This is not a combination that works. My love for Cape Cod forces me to speak out against this book. The author obviously has some maturing to do. Not only in his stlye of writing but in the discovery of his environment.
3,0.065 grass trimmer line,"Works fairly well. Don't notice any reduction in the noise level when using. The string seems to break off rather easily, causing more string to have to be fed to the head of the trimmer. It also tends to get jammed inside the spool. So when the string breaks or is cut while trimming, the end is not always easily visible to be re-thread through the hole in the head. You sometimes have to search for the end and pull it out with needle-nosed pliers, or unwind the rest of the spool and re-wind it back on. I am using it in a WeedEater model called Featherlite."
3,Looks great but a bit hard to use.,"I've had this wine opener for about 6 months and I find I rarely use it because it is somewhat cumbersome compared to other hand-held wine openers that I have. The main problem is that the corking mechanism is not vertically adjustable so the bottle of wine has to dangle precariously in the air while you perform the operation.If you could adjust the mechanism to fit the height of each bottle of wine, this thing would be 5 stars.Other than that one complaint, I do find it to be very nice looking. We leave it on display with a nice bottle of wine resting on the wooden base. It's a very classy look."
5,"And recorks nicely, too!","Yes, as stated above, it's a GREAT wine opener. Once you drill into your head to start with the handle in the back and pull forward, it opens perfectly every time. BUT if you leave the cork on the corkscrew, put the bottle back in and push the handle from FRONT to BACK, you'll get a perfectly recorked bottle to enjoy later! I've had mine for literally years with no trouble and never a failed uncorking. I'm back to buy one for our dock so our fellow boat buds can all enjoy it!"
4,Rogar Works Well,"After using and purchasing many different hand held cork removers I must say that I believe that this is the last one I will ever need for the home. Very robust and impressive looking too. A bit tall for my 5'2"" wife to easily use when it's on top of our wine fridge but she doesn't complain. I will be buying another one for our vacation home."
5,"Beautiful, Functional","I purchased this as a gift for my close friends 2 Christmases ago. They love it and it is still on their counter being used every day. Every time I go to visit, they tell me how many more compliments they have received on this item. They love everything about it and would not change anything about it."
1,"No, or poor parts availabilty for product known for failures","When it works it works great! However, when it breaks, not only does it not work at all, but parts are difficult or impossible to obtain, I tried ordering a part direct from the company and received a response that they were backordered and would not be available for three months. According to their own website, this part (#14) had frequent failures, so why they did not stock the parft in the U.S. is beyond me! I placed an order for the backorder, and that was 3 months ago! - not a word! According to their websit, this part most often breaks due to hard corks. That is proably right as for some reason the corks seem to have got harder but all the more reason why they should not have improved the general durability of their product or stock adequate replacement parts."
5,Classy and Easy,"No more sore wrists or pieces of cork in your wine. These openers are a snap to use and lovely to look at, too!"
4,Inspired love of all things fashion,"I read this book when I was little, when the book was first published. I not only loved the character, but it introduced me to the world of haute couture, designers, and England. It's interesting that such a slight, sweet story could have had such an impact on a child. In a real sense, it shaped my life. It's a charming book. It may not change your life but it will brighten it for an afternoon."
4,Cute,"Paul Gallico's delightful little book (little as in, its only about 150 pages, give or take) is about Mrs. Ada Harris (or Mrs. `Arris, as she would say in her cockney accent), a London charwoman who finds herself coveting in the worst way imaginable a Dior dress. Never mind that she can't afford it; never mind that she'd never have any place to wear it. After winning a bit of money, and scrimping and saving the rest, Mrs. Harris goes off to Paris to the House of Dior.But nothing turns out the way she imagines it to be--especially the people, who she'd imagined to be disgusting and dirty. Once there, Mrs. Harris becomes acquainted with a number of eccentric characters, to whom she becomes a sort of 1950s fairy-tale godmother. The books is completely charming and funny. My only criticism of the book is that Gallico could have drawn Mrs. Harris's week-long stay in Paris out a bit more."
5,The Word Eater---And Word Disappearer!,"The word Eater is such a cliffhanger, I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed this book. It has significance, as well as affection. Lerner, a lonely sixth grader befriends a worm, and discovers it magic powers-it eats words! Whatever words he eats will permanetly disappear! I would definitly reccomend this book for ages 9+ and for a boy OR girl."
4,The Word Eater-you'll eat it up!,"Mary Amato takes the text of 3 different stories (Fip the worms birth, Lerner Canse's problems at school, and a facory filled with under paid children) and puts them together. This is the story about a girl named Lerner who discovers a magical worm named Fip. If Fip eats a word, that word dissapears of the face of the earth-forever! Lerner learns more and more about Fip. The more she learns, the more the book gets interesting. The book has a unique text style that always keeps the reader thinking: what's going to happen next?"
5,a must read!,"I read and had my daughter read this book years ago and never forgot it.Great and very creative story,I now purchased it for my young boys, 11 years later and they loved it.they found the message of the story similar to another book call ""The Chocolate Touch"",which basically say ""be careful what you wish for""."
4,thing disappearer!!!,"This book is so full of imagination, I want to eat words myself!!!!! But the words that pencils make is poisonous, so I can't eat words. Really read this amazing book!!!"
1,Horrid!!!!,"I got this heaping pile of turd at a book fair five years ago. I could hardly finish it.That is because it is sooo stupid! Basically, some stupid worm can eat stupid words.The girl in the story is naive and not smart enough to make friends of her own so she can get in a stupid club. Oh, how original! A moron could have figured out a plot as simple as that! Trust me, I could use every word in the thesaurus that means stupid. Heck, why not?This book is stupid,senseless, brainless,idiotic,simple,shallow,impundent,witless,irrational,inane,ridiculous,mindless,ludicrous,muddled,absurd,half witted, nonsensical,silly, crack-brained(I can agree with that!)childish, insane,moronic,asinine,thoughtless,imbecilic, I could go on."
1,"NOT JUST BAD, SMELLY.","A stunningly bad debut. These tales fall somewhere between short stories and rambling cracker monologues. Painfully obvious in their need to ""SHOCK"" and be ""EDGY"" they amount to little more than the work of a beat poet with tourettes. Self-consciously strange without being believable or even interesting I was left only with the conclusion: Hillbillies are impressively capable of buggery and squirrel hunting but the demands of character, setting and plot are way beyond this writer's gifts.Perhaps this stuff passes for ""daring"" in the provinces but anyone who's taken Lit 101 will recognize this for what it is: hackwork."
4,Rest Area,"I feel without reservation the Clay McLeod Chapman is a talented, skillful, imaginative writer. This collection of short stories can make provacative reading in small portions to digest between readings.I have seen some of Chapman's PUMPKIN PIE SHOWS wherein he and other actors narrate his tales injecting some humor and all the required intonations of a drama.Remarkable watching which is mirrored in the Rest Area reading.This authors first novel I find to be a valid measure of his continuing progress as an author. Having just completed an Advance Reader's Copy of Miss Corpus I think Chapman's growth is quite apparent in this moving, macabre and painfully detailed story of death and dispair. Two totally different love stories that comecrashing together. I digress"
3,weird & fascinating!,"What I like about this author's writing is its directness - right into other people's minds: the tough deaf kid on the bus; the hotdog thief; a mother whose son has been killed in war; a father looking for his lost child.20 strange, enticing stories from the insides of other's lives in all their mournfulness, their rage & loneliness. Clay McLeod Chapman knows how to write from a children's point of view, especially about how incomprehensible parents can be.If you like short stories - don't miss this collection!"
5,fascinating & brilliant,mr. chapman's stories are haunting and absorbing. i could not put the book down from the moment i turned the first page. a direct descendant of edgar allan poe; mr. chapman's obsession with the weird and macabre is a must read!
5,Great author,"Myron Uhlberg is a prolific author, having published 7 books after his 65th birthday. He has many others in the works. He choses his words carefully and meaningfully. Most of the storyline is based on some aspect of his life, having been raised by 2 deaf parents. He builds a sense of deep, caring for the characters which will connect you to them. The illustrator has done an excellent job of capturing the essence of the storyline."
3,Song Listing,"I wished Amazon had listed the songs on this video to help in selecting which sing along tape to buy. I got this one and liked the Lion King DVD better. Here's a list of songs: 'Just around the river bend' Pocahontas; 'Cinderella work song', 'Why should I worry' Oliver & Co. (Billy Joel), 'Little Wooden Head' Pinocchio, 'Can you feel the love tonight' Lion King; 'Higitus Figitus' Sword in the Stone, & 'Colors of the Wind' Pocahontas."
2,Some great songs!,There are some good songs but most of them are a waste of time. I Saw this video. This is the perfect video for my mother's friends baby.
2,What is amazon thinking?,"Ok, this is a great show. But, just as with the Batman the animated series pack, it is horribly over-priced. $98 is a ridiculous amount to pay, considering that last week it was listed as $48, and also that you can pick up seperate seasons individually cheaper. Come on amazon, lift your game on this one and give us a good price for a very good series!23/09/2007 - Since posting this, amazon has dropped the price of this set significantly, so well done to them for noticing this and listening to what we want."
1,Why does Amazon keep raising their price on this?,"I don't understand why amazon keeps vastly increasing their price on this 3-pack. I mean you can buy them seperately for around $70, why would I pay almost $100 to buy them together? Buying together is supposed to be less isn't it?This 3-pack set used to be around like $45. Now its almost $100? What the heck happened?Come on amazon, stop trying to rip people off..."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT,I read the review below and I agree with everything that person said but 3 stars is too high. I hate how the stroller does not navigate properly and I hate the basket. I also wish I had spent a few extra bucks for the Bugaboo.
1,"So this is what an edgy movie looks like to a couple of talentless, old guys","This was just embarassing. I actually felt bad for the actors/ Especially funny was the small cute girl playing the evil vampire with the lame male overdub. The director is clearly a guy who grew up listening to 80s metal and never grew out of it. Hey man, time has passed you by. Your movie was the worst."
2,Greatly Disappointing!,"For me as a colourist looking for innspiration, this book is very disappointing in ""the flesh"".Given the description, I did not expect to receive a book that only has b/w photos. The ""view"" of selected pages gave no clue to this aspect.I thought that ""expressionism"" is charactorised, paricularly through its use of vivid colour!!Amazon, I think you need to provide more detailed information in your descriptions of an article, and for me this experience was an expensive lesson on purchasing online."
1,"too many words, not enough art",I actually intensly hate art books where the writer gets off on his own writing so much that he forgets his subject - or at least he has lost track of his subject and I definitly think that is true of this book.
2,not exactly what the picture shows,"The Good: The extension wand is wonderful. It is metal, so it is far more sturdy than the plastic wand I was replacing. I also love the mechanism for adjusting the length of the wand.The Bad: The floor vacuum attachment is NOT what is shown on the picture. The one I received does not have a little hole to attach to the wand, and because it does not have the hole to lock it into the wand it falls off when I am cleaning. That is the main piece that I use, so I am very disappointed and I am going to investigate the possibility of having it replaced with one that DOES have the hole (assuming they exist since that is what the picture shows)."
2,The Good and the Bad of It,The tool kit is great; that is the good of it. The bad of it is the main purpose for purchasing the tool kit was to get a good carpet vacuum head attachment. This one is horrible. It doesn't push back and forth over the carpet. It gets stuck on the carpet and picks up the lint on the felt and simply doesn't work. It is also all plastic. I am very disappointed because of it.
3,Its okay.,Plastic quality is not the best but its okay... I couldn't find anything better. The bag for organizing the accessories is useless.
2,"Didn't think think this was at all funny, and I LOVE Barry's usual humor.","I'll start out by saying I love Dave Barry, think he's brilliantly hilarious, and time spent reading his books is quality feel-good time...except for this book.I didn't think it was funny, thought it was quite violent, which is OK...but not particularily funny to me. Many loopy bumbling characters which is also OK, but that's not what I was looking for when I picked up a Dave Barry book. The writing flows and this is an easy read...but I can't believe all the raves it got, just don't know where the critics/writers saw the terrific humor - is there a secret code among writers that I wasn't clever enough to decipher? But reading is a very personal experience and thank God for the sake of variety that we don't all like the same thing. My next Dave Barry probably won't be a novel...but I look forward to continuing to read & enjoy the rest of everything he's published so far."
4,loved it!,I have never read anything Dave Barry has written so had no idea what to expect. Once I picked it up I could not put it down. I found myself reading parts of the book to my husband. It was great fun.
4,Four stars is just right.,"It is interesting to read through the reviews, from the ones that say they want to give this book 6 stars or more, to those who say 1 star is too much. Yet, the overall average is 4 stars, which in my opinion is the correct rating, so perhaps that proves that the rating system works pretty well, at least when there are a large number of reviews. This is by no means the best book ever written, nor is it laugh-out-loud funny throughout. One reviewer called it ""Carl Hiaasen Lite"" and I think that is a fair assessment. It is a quick, fun read and quite funny. It does have a plot, and a suspenseful ending. Even though the actual ending was not that surprising, Barry did have me wondering how he was going to get rid of the bad guys and save the good guys. I think that Dave Barry has a future in fiction, but I would agree with those who feel his nonfiction is better. I feel confident that he will continue to write sucessfully in both areas."
2,Disappointing,"I love Dave Barry & think he's one of the funniest writers around, which is why I was so excited to read his book. While parts of it were funny, on the whole, it just didn't cut it for me as a book. It was very disjointed and a bit too far-fetched for its own good. Maybe his next book (if he decides to write one) will be better...."
2,Very disappointing,"I'm a big Dave Barry fan - I have a large collection of his other books, which I avoid reading on the train home because I embarrass myself too frequently. As a result, I looked forward to this Barry novel. Frankly, it doesn't cut the mustard at all. It has quirky characters and a quirky plot, but for me it just doesn't get off the ground. I think I chuckled a couple of times and smiled another couple, but I could have read it on the train without causing any disturbance. Dave Barry's true forté is the newspaper column; I think he should stick to that."
2,"A funny writer, but not a novelist","Dave Barry is probably the most funny columnist working in America today. And so it's not surprising that ""Big Trouble"" is filled with amusing lines and witty turns of phrases. The book is also filled with characters -- but there's not a memorable one in the bunch. The characters and plotting is at a sit-com level. A lot happens, but much of the action is predictable or silly. When I finished the book, I kind of shrugged. I love Dave Barry as a humorist, but as a novelist, I found him a waste of time."
5,Big Trouble Rawks,"After having read the book in one sitting i'll have to say a couple of things.As one of the other members posted, the book had this eerie feeling that it was based on Dave Barry's columns. The reality as i see it, is that Dave Barry loves to harp on the same issues over and over again, and his themes from the columns naturally transplanted over into the book. His opinions tend to flavor the book, and it's fun when you can see part of the story you know he directly took out of one his ranting columns.The book isnt particularly deep either. It's fun and all, dont get me wrong, but it's a work of fiction that's meant to be zany. I walked away from the book thinking ""cool"" or some other similar word. It was nothing incredibly profound.if you're looking for an awesome novel, pick up ""heart of darkness"""
3,Floridian Satire with no crocodiles,"I didn't know anything about Dave Barry before I read this first novel, save for watching the file adaptations, which I thought was cute fun if a little too ""in-your-face"". ""Cute fun"" is an apt description for the book as well. It slides off the reader like candy, but leaves very little aftertaste."
1,What a dog!,"And I don't mean Roger--I mean this whole book! Underdeveloped characters, radical shifts in tone, clumsy plotting, uninspired dialogue, and ham-handed intrusion of the humor columnist's (as opposed to the novelist's) voice in the narrative all combine to sink this book. It was like Barry made up his mind to write a novel, started it, then couldn't wait to get it off his desk. And I can't believe that Barry's buddies Carl Hiaasen and Elmore Leonard, with whom he consulted when he needed help finishing this book, didn't take him aside and tell him it stank; they did him, and us readers who spent good money on this book, no favors by pretending it was good!"
3,"Like his column, but longer and not as funny","Dave Barry's first novel, Big Trouble begins well with the same off-kilter sense of humor his readers love. As the novel develops, the sense of humor remains, but seems a strange contrast to the relatively unsavory actions and foul language of two of his main characters. I found the stream of swear words distracting and unnecessary. Overall, it was okay light reading, but if you want good Dave Barry, stick to his columns."
1,Big Trouble = Big Bore,"Okay, the characters are bad, the plot is bad, the dialogue is bad...and all is forgiven if it's funny. It's not. The last funny part was when one character, in contemplating suicide, thinks he'll jump from his balcony and aim toward the Firebird of a neighbor who always plays his stereo too loud. Dave Barry should have thrown his word processor at the Firebird. And if that didn't do the job, the guy with the Firebird should have driven over it a few times, until Dave is convinced to stick with columns."
2,Big Trouble is Big Disappointment,"I purchased this book with high expectations. Every column Dave Barry has ever written has cracked me up and this book was made into a movie, so it had to be funny, right? Wrong. Even when Barry tries to be funny, it's not in the plot of the story, which is complicated enough without having to search for something to laugh at. The only times where this book is mildly amusing is when he describes various things, mostly his characters. It becomes difficult to laugh at the characters' actions when they're surrounded by such things as shootings, abusive marriages, and bomb smugglings. It also doesn't help that the 'funniest' part of the book is described on the back cover. This may have been a funnier read if I had been a resident of Miami, but I'm not. I expected to laugh out loud several times throughout the course of this book. I was left looking for something more than this empty, sidewinding, time-wasting novel."
5,Exhilarating and VERY Funny!,"Dave Barry should continue to write fiction! I'm a very serious Mystery/Thriller fan and I don't normally stray. However, I was in a bookstore and picked up the book and decided to read something a little different! This book was really well written with a good story, good characters and very funny! Excellent book, Mr. Barry; I hope you write another fiction book soon!"
3,Fluff Read,"I once heard that newspapers are written for people with a 4th grade education level. Well, it carries thru to this book. The characters in this book were very one sided with everyone falling into neat little catagories. The author seemed to try a little too hard with the hummor. All in all it isn't too bad of a book but it is a very lightweight read."
3,"Pretty Funny, if you're in the mood","Big Trouble is a pretty funny mis-adventures in Florida kind of tale with some very funny moments and some dry patches in between. The bad timing of the video was tragically politically uncorrect due to real live terrorism that occured after filming began, which wasn't as good as this book, but also pretty good as a sleeper that you probably haven't seen unless you were looking for it. If you like off beat humor and are not easily offended by bad language, and politically less correct subject matter, this is a good afternoon eater of a book."
2,Cheap Rip-off Of Elmore Leonard,"Dave Barry's novel is a quick read, but there's nothing fresh about the story or the characters. The story centers on many different characters that become involved in a potential airport disaster--a columnist, his son, a rich, sleazy lawyer, a wannabe criminal, etc. Like Elmore Leonard's books, the characters begin to collide in unpredictable ways. But the pay-off is just not that great. You may find yourself thinking ""What's the point?"" after finishing the novel.This book was made into a pretty forgettable movie that featured a great cast (Tim Allen, Rene Russo, Stanley Tucci, Tom Sizemore, etc.)."
3,Okay,I am not a big Barry reader and purchased this book for its advertised humor. I found the book disappointing but maybe I wasn't in a mood for his sense of humor. The characters were CHARACTERS and little about the narrative had any basis in reality. Only the exagerated sense of the ridiculous kept me reading through to the end.Beverly J Scott
1,Amatuerish,"Early in this book Barry coins the phrase ""megaturd"" to describe those multi-part social-ill stories that newspapers are always doing, but I thought the word more aptly described this book. The long form does not appear to be Barry's strength--nor does plotting, characterization, pacing, or pretty much anything else besides trying to be funny. And to the reviewer who said we should cut Barry some slack because it's his first novel: regardless of how many novels an author's written, for 24 bucks, it'd better be good. This one ain't, folks."
5,Laugh-out-loud funny,"Dave Barry is already notorious for winning a Pulitzer Prize for using words such as ""booger"" in his syndicated column. Now comes his first novel, ""Big Trouble,"" a tale involving a bunch of savory and unsavory characters, including (but hardly limited to) a boozing embezzler, a put-upon ad man, a pair of weapons-dealing Russians, two hit men from New Jersey, a hallucinogenic toad, and a sports-talk radio station which gives new meaning to the phrase ""vast wasteland,"" all set against the urban shooting gallery that is Dave Barry's Miami. Anything else would be giving away the plot.""Big Trouble"" is like a Dave Barry column come to raucous life, and is a definite cure from the depression resulting from reading the morning headlines. Gleefully funny, outrageously inventive and full of memorable phrases, the book is a laugh-out-loud winner."
5,"You will be taken for mad, if you read this book in Public","It is impossible to read this book without laughing aloud. I am what they call ""Salary Man"" in Japan (read Desk Jockey). Hence it was very easy to identify with the Hero. The book is spontaneous and the links between the characters including the goat and the narration is just amazing. One can trade well earned dollars for this ""make you feel good"" book"
3,Sounds awfully familiar,"Dave Barry's attempt at a novel isn't bad...but it's not that great, either. Carl Hiaasen (I'm sure he's sick of hearing that name) gets old after two of his carbon-copy novels, but I had the vague feeling that Barry used one of them as a virtual step-by-step how-to-write-a-novel guide. The same types of characters exist, the same plot lines are generally followed, etc. Why can't these guys get out of Miami? The city's not *that* interesting, and it's difficult to come up with new jokes when you've exhausted all the everybody-has-a-gun lines you can dream up.Anyway, the plot isn't bad--it's actually quite interesting, if not terribly original or deep. Yet something doesn't quite fit right in the whole mess. Barry's a good writer, both for his columns and this fiction (Naked Came the Manitee is surprisingly good, too), but I can't shake the feeling that he was just going through the motions on this one."
3,First stab at fiction,"This is Barry's first try at a fiction book, so it's understandable that it doesn't crank out as many laughs as his other books. It's got its fair share of great moments, and the plot is good, but it's not his greatest work. If you're interested in it, then take a look; if not, don't bother."
5,Entertaining,"This is the most entertaining books I have read for a good long time. I read books primarily for entertainment and have been in a stretch where I have been reading serious fiction. Whew! What a relief to read Big Trouble, a book that is never pretentious enough to make a claim as big fiction. The plot is not necessarily believable, but is off and running in a hurry. Puggy hitches his way down to Florida and becomes connected with the Herk family (the name is not an accident) Arthur Herk is indeed a big jerk, with some serious problems, the largest of which is that he appears to be on someone's hit list. The book quickly moves from what hilarious escapade to another.If you are ready for a fun light read, this is your book. If you indeed expect to be edified and educated while reading, I advise you to skip it. You most likely will be outraged."
3,"Okay, but what I hoped from Dave","Background: grew up in South Florida reading and loving Dave in the Miami Herald but I live many states away now. I found out after reading the book that it was made into a movie starring Tim Allen. I'm sort of a movie buff but still had never heard of the movie and to date I've never seen it.Pretty good book, but not what I had hoped from Dave Barry. I guess this was his first foray into a full novel. The frog is the best part and it is pretty much what one would expect from a goofy, South Florida tale. It has lots of funny moments, but I really don't know if non-Dave Barry fans could enjoy it because the end story leaves alot to be desired.Nonetheless, if you get if for cheap, it's a quick read and it's funny."
4,Fun and entertaining,"I thought this was a very enjoyable book. The plot is very Hiaasen, the humor very Barry. The plot was possibly a little too much for the lightheartedness of the book; it made the ""dangerous"" plot turns a little hard to take seriously. But, books like this shouldn't really be taken too seriously. Recommended for anyone who likes Dave and/or Carl Hiaasen. Or who has issues with Miami."
1,dull and simple,"I was barely able to finish this book. I found it to be bland, dull, and almost totally humorless."
2,Dissapointed in Dave,"How out of touch am I? I live in South Florida and enjoyed the delightful descriptions of familiar places. The way he writes up the Miami airport is not to be missed and the cruise ship passengers are great fun. His characters are a memorable hoot. However, Dave is too funny and too good to resort to unending crudity. His columns use vulgarity as a well honed device but the novel simply bludgeons us over the head with them. After a while it's just more of the same ad nauseum. The subject matter is crazy and it's a one-sitting read. Save yourself for his wonderful columns and spend your evening reading something else, perhaps his earlier books. As a previous reviewer said, ""I'm a big fan of David Barry. I read his columns and have read many of his books. But ""Big Trouble"" was a big let-down."
2,Disappointing experience,"Let me say this first: I LOVE Dave Barry. I must have at least 90% of his books, and I rolled on the floor laughing with every one of them. But ""Big Trouble"" was a disappointment. Not once did it make me laugh - Barry's humor simply doesn't lend itself to a novel. Maybe I was expecting too much, possibly a storyline? (this one is far-fetched as a B-movie & very predictable towards the end), characters? (Barry doesn't waste time actually bringing his characters to life). Most of all, when writing dialog, one has to understand the HUGE difference between spoken and written word. ""Big Trouble""s dialog reads as if cut from one of Barry's columns. Would have been funny there. Isn't funny as dialog. Anyway... if you are a Barry fan - don't expect too much here."
2,Very disappointing.,"May I first say that I am a fan of Barry's? I love his columns and his comedy books. I didn't like this in the least.It reaks of rookieness. The characters are so flat and predictable that you will not be able to attach to them. The plot is empty and very, very boring.And, worst of all, he seems to try and make up for it with distasteful humor. I'm no prude, but this is pretty vulgar stuff, and the payoff in humour is lacking.Barry is a great columnist, but his fiction is bottom of the barrell, please don't bother."
5,Laughed out loud through the whole book,"I listened to this book on tape in the car, and worried about getting in an accident. I laughed so hard I had to turn it off in heavy traffic. I spilled coffee laughing. I didn't want it to end. This is a VERY funny book."
2,Disappointing,"This reads like a Carl Hiassen-wannabe novel; if you haven't read any of Hiassen's books, you'd be better off reading his _Stormy Weather_ or _Strip Tease_. It's not that the book isn't funny; it is; but it's just a little *too* fluffy (an odd critique for a humor novel, I know). 48 hours after reading it, I have no solid recollections of any parts of it. Mental cotton candy."
4,"A light, fun read","I've never followed Barry's column, and read _Big Trouble_ on the advice of a friend. It was light and fun, a little quirky, and an easy read. The plot isn't the best part of this book - it kinda just happens, but the gems are the characters and Barry's sidebar comments."
1,255 Page Sunday Comic,All women are smart. Men are slow. Criminals are stupid. Police officers can never figure out what is going on. Criminals are Italian. Parents don't understand teenagers. Teenagers think their parent's aren't cool.Dave Barry manages to write a 255 page book with all the generalities and depth of the Sunday comics.The plot is simplistic and the characters thin and the stereotypes well known and not funny. Dave Barry manages to rehash the same material he has been using for years . . . most of it humerous on its own but hard to take in book form.
1,ain't nothing there,"I guess if you enjoy Carl Hiaasen, Elmore Leonard and/or Kinky Friedman you'll enjoy this garbage as well.I personally don't find any of the above authors creative or funny. In fact I find them to be just rude and crude. Amateurs.Also, I posted a one star review of this book (& a few others) that never made it to your screen....hmmm...Seems Amazon is reviewing our reviews and yanking the negative one stars, leaving mostly 2-5 stars for your viewing. Rotten pool."
1,Ferociously Funny ?,"All this booked lacked was the Marx brothers and the Three Stooges. To call this a ""Ferociously Funny Novel of Love and Mayhem"" is like describing a root canal as a mildly uncomfortable experience. The characters re-defined uninteresting and the plot had the depth of a parking lot puddle.I kept waiting for the good part and at each turn another moron showed up and added to the galactic stupidity of this novel. If I sound like I did not enjoy this book it is only due to the fact that I really did not enjoy this book."
3,Carl Hiassen lite,"Um- how can you say anything bad about Dave? Mildly amusing, mild character development, hey- he tried. Dave, we love you; stay with what you know. -Damn funny at the book signing!"
1,"Stick to writing humor columns, Dave","I've been a fan of Dave Barry for many years, so was excited to hear of his first novel. What a profound disappointment. The story is dull, the people are dull and, worst of all, the only funny character is the dog. If you want to buy my copy of this book cheap, send me an email--it's stinking up my house"
1,Avoid this book,I should have heeded his warning to minors before attempting to read this dreadful waste of paper. Characters and setting are foul. His weekly columns *are* funny and seem to be written by a different person altogether.Read John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces if you seek genuine adult humor.
1,a disapointment!!!!!,"An Elmore Leonard fan, read every book...some purchsed from Amazon, Bought this Stinker based on Leonard's recommandation.. How can he do this? King also praised the humor (can't find any). Because there is no humor, story or plot.It's a totally worthless effort."
4,Don't have high expectations,"Don't be fooled by the Author. I certainly liked the book. However, in crossing the literary barrier between astute social commentary (most of which involve boogers and bizarre events) and (humourous) fiction, Dave Barry loses a lot of his telltale schtick. The book has almost nothing in common with his articles and previous books, and, of course, is far racier than anything he's written in the past. So although an interesting read, do not read *Big Trouble* simply because it was written by your favorite humourist: you may be sorely disappointed."
4,So South Florida,"I want to thank Dave Barry for writing this book. No, it is not an instant masterpiece, it is not a top-of-the line genre piece, and it is not even super saturated with hilarity the way his compact columns have to be. What this is is a helluva ride through South Florida with a guide who knows his locals, who deftly portrays the comedy where many of us see only tragedy. Dave Barry is witty, he's funny, and he knows how to make you laugh. He readily admits that this novel was never endowed a plot, but neither was South Florida. Just hop on and enjoy the ride. (Think Carl Hiassen with a little less social justice and a lot more humor)"
4,A True Comic Relief,"I was feeling down, and this book most definitely perked me up. By reading some of the other reviews, I was perplexed by those who turned their noses up and rolled their eyes at this humorous page-turner. If you're picking up a Dave Barry book, don't expect Dickens! Lighten up! Have some laughs! In fact, have lots! I think anyone who has a teenager or any teenager who has a single parent will find this story quite amusing; it was a very creative plot, filled with coincidence, but then, isn't that how life really is? Great story, Dave."
5,READ IT AND WEEP ... FROM LAUGHTER.,"I read it. I loved it.Then I read it again. And, yes, I love it even more.Nobody sees gangsters and dogs any funnier.Thank you, Dave -- keep the novels coming."
2,Overall a disappointment,"Reading the covers, you'd think this was DB's funniest work. There are indeed some funny scenes, and more than once I was crying with laughter, but his other books are more consistently humorous. The plot is intentionally whacky, but is neither intelligent nor believable. The characters are instantly forgettable. There is a scene of (mild) sexual cruelty that seems completely out of place in an otherwise lighthearted farce (imagine a rugrats cartoon with a molestation scene)...Where was the editor? I love Dave's column and non-fiction, but the best thing about this book was that I only wasted 1 1/2 hours reading it."
5,"One Word ""Funny""","This being Dave Barry's first shot at fiction, I was very surprised at the outcome. Even though it is modeled after a Carl Hiaasen novel, it is almost up to par with Hiaasen's best. This wacky-Florida novel groups a cast of characters, whose strangness, simpleness and quirkeness show that Barry can do fiction.The plot has a few holes, but Barry makes up with it with great character presentation. This is a must read for those who love this genre, and for those who love Dave Barry. Don't let the fact that it is fiction scare you away from reading one of America's top humorist.The book is not for younger readers. The language is a bit rough, and Barry mentions this in the onset of the book. There is a lot of adolscent humor which may un-nerve a few readers. If you don't like books were people wet their pants stay away. If you do want a laugh a page quick read pick this up right away"
5,Most hilarious since No Time for Sergeants,"Are you old enough to remember laughing out loud at No Time for Sergeants? That was 45 years ago and Dave Barry's first novel may be funnier. The books starts with hilarious Acknowledgements -- and gets funnier. I envy anyone who is about to read it for the first time. But MY copy is autographed and I bought copies for my sisters as Christmas presents.A sequel? THERE'D BETTER BE! After all, I'm only a couple hours of drive time from him! <G> Seriously, I can't wait for the next one, and the next one, and the... --Terry Miller (media@naples.net)"
3,"Moderatly funny, but not as funny as author's columns","Book makes for quick reading, but ending was a bit abrupt . . . and overall, it left me looking forward to author's next book of columns . . . i'm not so sure I would bother reading another of his novels."
3,Dave Barry is no Ernest Hemingway but....,"Not the greatest work of fiction, or well written for that matter, but if you want a fun, very quick read, then I suggest you pick this book up."
5,Really hard to put down--and funny too!,"Even though this book was definitely not entirely realistic, it was hilarious (I have never laughed out lout while reading a novel before) and also had a great story with plenty of action. I highly recommend it and I hope Dave Barry keeps on writing novels that are this good."
2,Very superficial shallow and hard to believe.,"I bought this book based on the recommendations I read on the jacket. Maybe it was me, but I did not laugh and found the characters poorly developed and hard to believe. Barry should stick to writing jokes or whatever it is he does regularly for a living."
3,Close but no cigar,"This was one of those books I couldn't put down... and I didn't. Barry has put together a wonderful little tale that is a delightful afternoon read.The only thing it suffers from is poor build up. Granted I wasn't expecting very much, but I would have liked to learn some more about a few characters or seen everyone get a bigger piece of the plot puzzle. When I was finished I was hoping for more to read, but was disappointed. I chalk it up to high expectations (Thanks to all those darn reviews all over the cover :) )If you love Dave's columns or are just looking for something to pass the time (Like I was) then Big Trouble is a good read. But if you're hunting for something more, I'd look elsewhere."
4,Big Spoof!,"Fast and funny, Dave Barry pokes fun in a very fun way! The backbone of what makes this book funny, I believe, is the descriptive talent Barry constantly displays. The book is filled to the brim with mayhem and bedlam, missed opportunities, and overly officious public servants. Miami Florida is the perfect setting for such nutty shenanigans. I found it to be a rollicking fun ride!"
5,Hurray for Dave Barry!! Keep them coming.,"Mr. Barry's first attempt at the funny, mystery novel was an absolute success. From the first line, his ""charaters"" were alive and so funny that I could not stop laughing. He tells us he has no plot but develops a convoluted one that weaves all his characters together and the reader,too. Thank you Mr. Barry!! Write another one soon."
4,very funny and page-turning read,"this is such a funny book. i read a couple pages of this in one of my classes while my teacher was lecturing our class and i bursted with laughter. i highly recommend this book. for the upcoming film of the novel, i can see why, towards the end, they dropped it with the sept. 11th thing. although im pretty sure the film, if and when it is released, is not going to be as funny compared to the novel. so if you've heard of or seen the trailer of the film already, read the book first. i guarentee it will be better."
1,Big Trouble is Right,"Few people are funnier than Dave Barry, but he lost a bet with God when he signed the contract to write this book.Sorry.I wanted to be dazzled and entertained but I wasn't.Flat, stale, unimaginative.Bad book."
5,Surprising and Very Funny,"I am a Dave Barry fan and have read lots of his stuff. However, I didn't know what to expect with his first novel. I was pleasantly surprised. I was expecting a pour story line and lots of booger jokes, this was not the case. Barry delievers an indepth plot and does a good job developing his characters. I didn't want to put this book down. A great blend of Action and Comedy, you should read this book. The movie is all pretty good as well."
4,Pure Fun,"Zaney book written by Barry. So many character interacting in unreal situations that this book is just fun. It's for when your on vacation on the beach, wanting to get away from reality. Barry reminds me of Tom Robbins style of writting."
3,"Readable, but not funny at all.","I figured if this book could be made into a movie, with Hollywood stars and a Hollywood budget, it's got to be good. Add to the fact that it was written by Dave Barry, with a lot of reviews on the cover declaring it to be a great comedy, I thought I might have had a winner.Now I realized why the movie failed. The book wasn't at all funny. If no one said it was a comedy, I would have thought it was a bad action book. I didn't laugh or find anything humorous. The characters are non-engaging, and the story itself was farfetched, but not wacky or fun.The good point about the book is that it's a small, light read. Though not good, it's not annoying, boring, or drawn out.It's basically a series of unrelated characters that converge in an accidental nuclear bomb chase.Though not terrible, it really isn't much."
5,I love trouble!,"I've read Dave Barry's column each week for years. Discarding the rest of the paper temporarily, I hone in on Barry's work as the highlight of Sunday's Washington Post. Barry's first novel is truly entertaining. The mystic treehouse resident is my favorite. Even the dense, but hunky, police officer makes me smirk. All the characters, and there are quite a few to keep up with, are quirky and fun. If you are planning to see the movie, read the novel first!I met Dave Barry in person in Florida where he was speaking to a group involved with helping people with disabilities. All I can say is-- who is your publicist?Dave is a stud muffin. Why do pictures on his books add 20 pounds and make him look a tad dorky? Is this a clever ploy by your wife? Smart woman!"
2,Brain Candy,"OK, so not everything has to be great literature. The book is funny (sometimes very), a page turner, and instantly forgettable the moment you put it down. Not surprisingly, it's soon to be a movie - someone more cynical (oh, who am I fooling?) may think it was written to go Hollywood from the start. For a similarly misadventurous-type of plot, Tom Wolfe does way better in Bonfire of the Vanities."
3,"Great book, yet slightly disappointing","It goes without saying that any publication by Dave Barry will split your sides, as do his articals in newspapers across the globe. However, it seems that Mr. Barry was overmatched in his first attempt to write a feature length book. The novel starts our very strongly, with uproarious observations on South Florida, but the rest of the book seems to rely entirely on swearing, so much so that I once found myself tight-lipped for almost fifty pages. While this book contains some of Mr. Barry's unique style of writing, it seems to devolve to vulgar language whenever the story lags. Still worth buying, but it's not what I expected."
3,Carl Hiassen-Lite,"Dave Barry's ""Big Trouble"" is a breezy, funny, well-written page-turner. But if you've read any of his Miami Herald co-worker Carl Hiassen's books, you'll see that BT is a pale imitation of Hiassen's unique, bizarre and (to me) engrossing style - ""Southern Miami wacko,"" as Barry puts it.At the center of the story is a quartet of innocents, which is surrounded by rings of mobsters, illegal arms-traders and corrupt contractors. Add the Miami Police, the FBI and a street person in love with an illegal immigrant and you've got a wonderful Chaplinesque comedy, had Chaplin entertained the idea of portable nuclear weaponry.One thing Barry does better than Hiassen is his female characters. Whether out of empathy or better knowledge, his women and their relationshiops with men ring true. Unfortunately, Hiassen has him beaten by a mile in plotting and depth.Wait for the paperback, is my opinion. But if you like either Barry or Hiassen, it's worth a read."
1,Foul Language Distracts From Weak Story,"I was prepared to enjoy Dave Barry's first foray into Novels - I like his columns, and can appreciate the ironic humor. Too bad half way through the book he can't seem to keep it together. In one ""plot"" line, the same joke is repeated over and over and over. The language slowly goes from bad to worse, and the contrived scenes follow. (One unsettling scene involving a mother and her teenage daughter was more than tasteless, it was appalling how blase it was made to seem, and how unfunny it had become). I was embarassed to have it in the house, lest my children started to read it. In the future I will stick to his material that has been at least edited for newspaper publication."
3,"Failed to ""move me""...","I did NOT laugh until I cried, I did NOT fall out of my chair (Mr. King !) and I was only slightly impressed with the story line. I love Dave Barry, and I will be the first to admit it; but I did not appreciate his attempt at producing a novel. On a side note, I also did not appreciate the ridiculous amount of vulgar language throught the entire novel (on EVERY page. Maybe that's why Mr. King loved it so much :-) Hey, relax! I read Stephen King as well!!! At one point, I counted over 10 uses of a combination of the ""F"" word and other ungentlemanly (if that is such a word)terms. I'm not trying to tell Dave how to write, but after 75 times of using the ""F"" word, I began to wonder if he was writing for me, or trying to impress a bunch of thirteen year olds who giggle when their little buddies say ""naughty words"". Give me a break Dave!!! Please go back to writing your commentaries; I enjoy them MUCH more (and I do laugh at those until I cry )."
2,"Dave, take a few more days thinking up the next plot",Dave Barry is one of the funniest writers in the world. Just not in this book.The plot is so dumb that it brings down whatever humor there is.
1,Big Trouble a big disappointment,"Take out the obsessive/excessive use of foul language and a bunch of the characters (they all seem pretty much alike anyway) and Big Trouble might have made a fairly good short story. Barry could clean up the funny passages, like the traffic jam on Le Jeune Road, or interaction between the dog and the toad as material for his columns, which I always enjoy. I think the book is good material for a ""super-book-crushing"" garbage disposal. Please keep me anonymous, I'm embarassed I read it."
4,Great Barry -- but...,"All us DB fans will very much enjoy Dave's first foray into fiction, and Dave proves he can do Hiassen as well as Carl himself. But after half a book of truly great character set-up and wildly fun craziness, the book goes dark with some bad-karma sexual wierdness that doesn't fit the tone of the rest of the book. That aside, it's still great Dave, a fast, fun, laugh-out-loud read."
5,New insights into this great writer!,"Completely charming and so evocative of its time and the diamond-hard sensibility of its author, this collection shows that there is so much more to Margaret Mitchell than her single book. Highly recommended not only for Gone With the Wind fans but for anyone interested in women's and journalism history, the Jazz Age, or Atlanta in a simpler time."
4,Prelude to GWTW,"In this series of columns Margaret Mitchell wrote for the magazine of the Atlanta Journal, we can see the beginnings of some of the interests that were fully developed in the great novel she started a few years later"
3,"great graphics, but too slow","The graphics in this game are really good, and being able to play championship mode with two players is great, but the game takes entirely too long to load. $20 is a great purchase price, but save your money and wait for the new version of Rallisport (coming out 5/4/04)."
2,LESS THAN SPECIAL,"has too many inedibles in product AND ""flavored"" IS the operative word. love natural and no MSG but taste and mouthfeel need work. aftertaste too. will not buy again."
3,Okay...,Yeah it's tender and taste good at first. It leaves an aftertaste though and is a bit too sweet.
2,Did not hold up,"I wanted to like this product and at first I did. The texture is good and the flavor is unique, but it wore thin for me fast; I think it was excessive sweetness, and soon the smell bothered me. Furthermore, both opened bags (one at home, one at work) began molding after a couple weeks despite the silica packets. I've never had that with other beef jerky brands. Finally, I eat jerky mostly for the protein, and these have a couple fewer grams per ounce (and more carbs) than my favorites, which leaves them with no place in my rotation."
3,This book is rather out-of-date.,"I bought a copy of this when it was a new book (1987). Make no mistake about it, this is an 80's makeup style book. The approaches to eye makeup look rather garish today (though some would still apply to nightclubbing). Some of the advice about skin care is woefully out of date. Worth looking at if you're interested in determining what colors you look best in (clothing and makeup). The advice about makeup brushes is helpful to the novice. Take the rest with a grain of salt."
1,Forget it!,"If you know your season and your best colors (from any other Color Me beautiful book) then forget this one. You're much better off buying Bobbi Brown's or Aucoin's book, both of which will offer you much better make-up tips and ideas.The book is badly presented with boring pictures and graphics and an uninspiring layout that does nothing to attract your eye. When you go through Brown's or Aucoin's books, you find yourself itching to put some make on, with this one, you'll close the book and wonder what's on TV."
5,The Best Of Power Rangers,This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
1,Worst CD Ever!,"This CD doesn't even pay homage to Power Rangers. Track 1 isn't even the real version of go go power rangers! Track 2 is just the version of the wild force theme that ABC Family uses to advertise Wild Force. It's not even the theme they used on the show. And Power Rangers Turbo, Go isn't even the one they used on the show."
5,Best Of Power Rangers Sound Track,"I like this CD but I need lyrics to every song because I ""mishear"" words."
1,A Butchery of Classics,"I bought this C.D. with the understanding that many of my favorites wouldn't be on it. However, I didn't know that the original and Turbo theme songs would be redone (for the worse.) Another negative review states that only three of the songs are from the series. I would assume that those songs are tracks 6, 7, & 8. 6 is from the Turbo Power Rangers Movie. 7 & 8 are from the Zeo series. If you're willing to buy the album for these three alone, go ahead. Otherwise, you're probably in for a disappointment."
2,NOT THE BEST OF THE POWER RANGERS,"There are many great songs for the power rangers.Where are they? I guess the producers have included what they like.I'm not saying the songs here are bad but there are other better songs that were ignored.However, i dont blame them; there is no way to include all of them in one CD.Try to wait and hope for another better volume to be released."
3,Definately a good pick-up for any Power Rangers fan...,"Finally, another Power Rangers CD. Sort of a best hits compilation, it combines the past hits from many of the past series from Turbo, to Zeo, to even Wild Force.There are only two downsides to this album.1) Most of these songs can be found on the Power Rangers Turbo Movie soundtrack.2) No songs are from the original series, the original hits by Aaron Waters (aka The Mighty RAW). Even the first track is just a remix of the original theme.Other than that, you get quite a few unreleased tracks that will no doubt make any Power Ranger fan happy."
1,There is no power in this cd,"I am a huge fan of the Power Ranger and Im 20!!!! I have been waiting for a CD like this,but what do I get? three theme songs and a bunch of crapy artist I have never herd of!They should have put all the power rangers theme song on this cd. Thats what the public wants! Save your money and just down load the theme songs off napster."
5,my son's favorite,My 2 year old plays this all the time! I now know all the words which was never my intention but it keeps him entertained
2,Slow mover,"This is the third Longarm novel I've read. Normally one of the adjectives for a Tabor Evans western would be ""fast pace"". However, this novel ""Ute Nation"" did not captivate my interest, and only through determination to finish the book was I able to read through page 170, the last page."
5,Johnny Cash Is Coming To Town/Boom Chicka Boom,One of Johnny Cash's better albums (i have over 30) out there. Plain & simple . No big production. Johnny Cash & The Tennessee Two. Thats all that is needed. Great album.
5,Lotsa sound,"Just plain awesome receiver. Got it used and/or pre-loved (not a scratch on it) and I'm just overwhelmed with the amount of sound produced by this machine. Main reasons for getting this particular model were price (paid 270 shipped) and the avail. of pre-outs. Currently using this unit with BIC V-80 subwoofer and m-audio AV-40, both (self)powered speakers. That's from HDMI connected sources, HTPC and XBOX 360. The amount of possible connections and the amount of other devices that could be controled by remote are almost endless.To recap, great, full and simply complete sound and very flexible connectivity options. Great unit!The only Con is that is really hard to find it for a decent price."
1,How hard is it to match numbers?,"I went to the Kingston website, looked up the compatible memory for a Dell computer. Then I went to Google, did a search for lowest price on that part number. Trusted Amazon, so paid a few dollars more and bought from Amazon. When I went to install the 6 identical memory modules I had ordered, I found I had 5 memory modules with the correct part number and a 6th which was physically very different and a very different part number. This is very sad and disappointing that this type of an error could occur.The 5 modules worked flawlessly which is typical for Kingston, though I am still disappointed that the memory does have the low rent Made in China label on it."
4,Great workout!,"I found this DVD to be a great workout for me. While some complain that the instructor talks too much -I didn't find this irritating - she tries to make sure your form is correct, as well as explaining the purpose of a particular exercise. I like the fact that there are 4 other ladies training alongside Dasha and they show differing intensity levels of each exercise. For a beginner this is a great option. You can choose to do the warm up/cool down or skip them - and choose with or without the background music. The minute countdown for each exercise plus the overall workout countdown is wonderful - so you know exactly where you stand - especially helpful for those if us who do our workouts early in the morning before getting kids and husbands off to school and work."
5,Jessica and Elizabeth's impossible resolution!,New Year's resolutions was what this book was all about. My favorite part is the way Janet Howell kept trying to get everyone else to break their resolutions (and not break her own.)Jessica and Elizabeth make the impossible resolution. Not to fight with each other.
1,It was the stupidest book I have ever read..,It was totally juvenile and I for 1 am not going to get excited about Jessica gushing over Elizabeth's blouse while secretly thinking it was horrible.
4,"Works fine, but is fragile at tip","Works fine with my Garmin StreetPilot 2610. This was a replacement for the first one that broke. The plastic end is not particularly strong, so be careful when not in use. Speaker quality is fine for its purpose."
1,Color Street Pilot III Plus Speaker/Power Adapter Cord,"I've about had it with this durned power adapter/speaker cord. Every year it falls apart and I have to buy another one. Garmin just makes the durned thing too durned cheap. Speaker and cord part is great. . .just the part that plugs into the lighter socket keeps falling apart. Gotta admit I'm a heavy user. . .like all day everyday for 5 years. The GPS itself is fabulous, as long as you order the update maps when they're available, (which isn't often enough). Update maps are $150 plus $25 or more for the adapter. . .costs me $180 a year to run under this system. Gotta admit. . .I love it. . .cept when it breaks."
1,Piece of Junk,"This power adaptor/audio unit is truly junk. My motorcycle vibrates the hex head bolt loose frequently which causes the speaker to flip flop. The thing is plastic so you can't torque the nut very heavily or you will break the plastic. The worst part is the horribly engineered power/data pins. If you remove the power plug frequently eventually you will snag a pin end and pull it out of its proper place and voila you are busted and have to shell out over $40 for a new proprietary power plug. A terrible accessory on an otherwise great unit. Unfortunately, this part is a single critical point of failure. Shame shame Garmin."
1,Cord is not working well.,I had bought this chord in October and have used it about 6 times now. Am having problems with the chord in that I have to jiggle the chord for my unit to come on. Not exactly what I expect from the product after having paid this much.
3,flimsy construction but must have,"title says it all, it is hard to fit into my ashtray lighter plug since the speaker part sticks out quite far. But since I misplaced my old one I was happy to buy this overpriced beauty instead of shelling out a few hundred more for a brand new gps."
3,SHORT CORD,"Garmin's products are of the best quality, but I am a little displeased that my travel cord needed replacement so soon. It would not work properly after three years of use. It was not a warranty item so I purchased it through Amazon. The price was very fair, but when I began using the product I noticed that the cord was shorter than the original causing complications in some vehicles. They should go back to the longer cord or at least give you an option.I want to say Amazon it at the top of their game. The Postal service put my package in a community parcel box and misplaced the key. It took them nearly a month to get access to my box. Meanwhile, I had contacted Amazon and they promply shipped a replacement at no cost to me. I received the replacement in four days. Once I got the first box, I was given clear instructions how to ship it back. Their procedure was effortless. I will continue to use your services."
4,Indispensible product but.....,The Garmin 2610 just won't work without this product but the plastic threads for the fuse holder should be beefed up by Garmin. I had to buy this replacement because the threads on my original unit became stripped after moving the 12v adapter from vehicle to vehicle over the past 4 years. Otherwise the product works great.
2,Faulty Replacement?,"I had to get a replacement due to the end breaking off. Fortunately, I was still under warrenty and got the replacement for free. However, the replacement cord was significantly shorter than the original. I'm not sure if tech support mailed the wrong adapter or whether Garmin re-engineered the cord. Anyway, make sure you tighten the end periodically, especially if you unplug it frequently. The fact that I had any problem with this critical component was bad enough. The shortening of the replacement cord was uncalled for."
1,Save Your Money!,"Rather than shell out $30 to $40 for another flimsy replacement, one can just go to Radio shack and buy a ""Y"" cigarette lighter accessory (allowing 2 accessories to plug into one socket). This assumes you can salvage the pieces from your broken plug-in. Simply reassemble the broken pieces (make sure the fuse is there), and slide all into one of the sockets on the ""Y"", then tape the Garmin plug and ""Y"" socket together to make sure it remains secure. You now have the new ""Y"" to plug in and out of the cigarette lighter and an extra socket on the ""Y"" for your celphone!!"
2,Garmin External Speaker with 12-Volt Adapter for StreetPilot,"The External Speaker with 12-Volt Adapter that arrived with my Street Pilot order failed to work within one month of purchase. It was was not abused or overused, that's for sure."
1,A broken adapter,"I received Garmin adapter, but it was not finished in manufacturing. It does not have the adapter to my garmin. No QA/QC at all."
4,Great item,I had the Garmin for a long time and the car charger cord simply died and so I had to replace it and was glad I was able to get it cheaper here!
4,Fixing your 3 hole punch,This replacement part saved the cost of replacing the whole paper punch. I would have given it a 5 except there were no instructions to replace the part and it took me a while to figure it out.
3,2 hour joy on a hot day,"It WORKS! For TWO HOURS.That's it. But those are glorious two hours. The coolest. Feels wonderful!But for smaller necks (I'm a girl!) it feels too bulky around my neck. So, I got creative and wear it like a bandana around my head. AWESOME! I tie the ties on the front and look like I have antennas.It keeps my brain cool on a hot night when I can't sleep.Wish it would last longer and wish there was a version for us smaller dainty necks. I mean, hello...when it was around my neck, I felt like I had a neck brace on. But a cool neckbrack.The color is good. Goes with anything.If this thing lasted at least 4 hours...I'd have bought another.You have to keep it in the freezer for it to last a long time though (I mean so the gel doesn't fizzle out and go flat like other cooling stuff I've bought) No matter how long it's in the freezer, though, once you take it out....it still lasts 2 hours total."
3,"It's okay, but........","All in all, I think this will probably do the trick for a couple of hours out with my camera, but after trying both, I prefer theChill-Its 6602 Cooling Towel, BlueNo freezing required with the Chill-Its; no ice to melt; and it kept me cool for a very long time.The ice bandana is a bit narrow for me, and while it does tie (a plus), it's kind of loose with it tied. I don't want it super tight around my neck, but not so loose that I keep having to hold the ties to keep it in place.If I wouldn't have to eat the shipping charges to return this, I would, and would then purchase another Chill-Its (which I'll probably buy anyhow).On the plus side of things, the fabric against the neck side is nice and soft, and the way the ice pack is made, makes it nice and flexible around the neck.Not a bad product; just doesn't suit me as much as the other. I will probably use this for when I get headaches, to tie around my head as a cold compress."
4,very helpful,"This product was very helpful to me this summer. While it would be nice if it lasted longer, it is a good cooling solution that you can wear without discomfort/annoyance while doing things like cooking and without looking too crazy in public. It also is nice if you have more than one...most are sold in 2 packs, because if you are home you can switch them out as one melts and the other freezes. I think it would be hard to make a product that needs to be thing and flexible too much thicker giving it a longer cool time. I was satisfied."
3,5 minutes of comfort,"I. Don't blame the ice bandana. My ideal temperature for gardening, carpentry, even a stroll, is 60 degrees. Otherwise I am one of those people who sweat. It pours off my face, stinging my eyes and irritating my skin. I go through a couple of kitchen towels wiping the stuff off my face and they end up wet; not damp... Wet.So I slip this little otter-pop in a sock around my neck and a feeling of cool relief is immediate--- but only for about 5 minutes. But I am an extreme case. Others have reported better results and I believe them. Just know that if you sweat like a roasting goose drips fat, it might be better to stuff a nylon jacket full of blue ice and wrap that around your suffering self.On the other hand, it is easy to slip the newly refrozen flexible ice pack back into the very well made product. On the negative side, it is a bit too large. My neck is 15.5 inches. There should be some kind of Velcro system to allow the ends to overlap."
2,Doesn't stay cold long enough,"I was a disappointed with this product. After freezing it overnight, keeping it in a cooler until the hotter part of the day, it didn't stay cool very long. It is also a little stiff for wearing around the neck."
1,Tedious beyond belief.,"This was the most tedious story I've read in a very long while. I rarely begin a book and not finish it but after getting more than half way through this one I just couldn't continue. The story is bogged down in so much mindnumbing, repetitive detail, detail that adds nothing to the story except to make it unbelievably tiresome. The main character, Susan Lenox, makes the same ridiculous decisions over and over again with the same disastrous results. I found this story to be very unsatisfactory. I gave this story one star because I had no other choice, I couldn't give it no stars."
2,over rated,"I was indeed impressed with this lady's moxy and self reliance. However, I was somewhat disappointed in the book as a whole. There was enough movement in the first half of the book to keep me reading, but the over descript pros made me weary. After a while I began to simply skim over the pages trying to find content. The story was powerful, but could have been told in one-forth of the pages."
1,This is not a good book.,"I enjoy old books and have been reading old books all my life. The writing style in 1 - 2 century old books is radically different from what we read today. This book is well written but boring. The author's case for sex education is presented as an in your face rant. The heroine is so sugary sweet that one almost wants to throw up. She endures many perils, most of which she brings on herself by her monumental sweetness and refusal to grow up by never relinquishing her naivete and maturing into a sensible thinking adult. I won't be reading any of his other books."
5,A LOST CLASSIC,"This lost classic is one of the great books of the turn of the century. Anything that could possibly happen to a woman at the turn of the century happens to Susan Lenox, so it's a panorama of the social conditions and mores of the period. I think it's a better book than Dreiser's SISTER CARRIE, but similar. It's a thousand-word page turner, written by a muckraking journalist-turned novelist with lots of axes to gring, and it's all fascinating. Twenty years after the book came out, MGM made a movie version of it with Greta Garbo, but the movie has virtually nothing to do with the book, and it's terrible (aside from Garbo, who is always interesting.) That's a particular shame, since the story of Susan had many parallels with Garbo's life, and a genuine adaptation might have been wonderful."
4,"wood owl 1"" x 18"" auger","Best auger I have ever used. Stretching the truth to call it "" nail chipper"" but does suffer less damage when nails are hit. Easy to resharpen."
2,NOT an Epilator,"Can't blame Amazon on this one, even the product package has a lable that says it is an epilator, but, it is a shaver and that is all. I give it 2 stars because 1) it isn't as advertised and 2) does no better job a shaving than any other product.I got this product because i wanted a new epilator as my Braun seems to be wearing out (after only 2 years). I like the shape of this and thought it would travel well and i like the fact that it is corded/cordless, wet/dry. After finding out it was just a razor, i was disappointed but thought, it might be good to take along anyway as the design is nice, lightweight, and comfortable to hold. My concern is in the on/off button. It is quite sensitive. Too bad Epilady did not either make it so it would not turn on if the razor was covered or put a guard/arm on the piece that flips to open the razor that covers/uncovers the button to keep it from accidentally being turned on when no being used. Still debating whether or not to just return it."
4,Epilady,"Love the design and compact sizeGreat value for the priceIt takes a few months to actually be able ""not to shave"" for about 3 weeks"
1,Cruising can't be this boring...,"As a new owner of one of these beautiful Tartan 37C classic designs, I thought this book would contribute to my education about this boat but I was sorely disappointed. There is virtually no content on the sailing characteristics, handling of the boat under different sea and wind conditions or even anything worthwhile on the set up or maintenance during a world cruise. With regard to the places visited, it was A to B, B to C with little worthwhile description of the places or any connection with the people encountered. From a point of the romance invoved, it was a cute premise but again had little interesting development. A pretty dull existance considering the awesome opportunities. Don't waste the money, go to the used book section where you will find mine."
5,Inspiring and Funny,A great story about a woman making her dreams come true. Her journey is exciting and funny. A true inspiration to many who would like to add a little adventure to their lives. A wonderfully written book for sailors and non-sailors alike.
5,Great Flick!,I love how this director used Alaska as the back drop not the main character. Beautifully shot and a good story-line.
2,on the ice,I thought the movie was very slow moving. I was interested for about the first 30 mins. The ending wasnt what I expected wasn't in my opinion the best way for a movie to end.
2,Made for hobbits?,"I am really shocked with how tiny something called a ""Counter mat"" can be. These wouldn't even protect my counters from my smallest pan. Any normal pan would hang over on all sides. They are also flimsy and don't lay flat, due to warping. The picture on them is nice."
4,Great for the price,"Great laptop for the price. Of course we're going to have to pull vista off of it because it only has 512mb RAM, but that's to be expected with most laptops these days. Otherwise it runs a lot better than I expected, esp. for only $430."
1,Just chords...,"I purchased this DVD thinking it would be about formulating chords. It is simply a compilation of clips featuring someone playing chord after chord. There is no instruction whatsoever. You can get the same thing from a chord chart. Although Mel Bay products generally are good, I don't recommend this one."
4,"Good DVD, but would like to have seen more extras","Being a fan of the show, I was quite happy with this DVD set. The stories are not necessarily for children, and can be enjoyed by anyone. The video and audio are good, but I wish there were more commentaries by the creators, maybe by even some of the voice talent. The little they had made me wish there was more. Still - if you're a fan of this show, I would recommend picking this up!"
3,Nice to see the cast expand.,"There was always more to the DC Universe than the 'top sellers'. JLI pulled out all the stops and brought in many more characters, giving them their own spotlight and showing us that they're not second-rate. And when they went back and forth in time, they pulled in even more. Lotsa good memories of comic books long gone."
3,"Good book, but not the best in the series","So far, I have enjoyed this series very much. However, I thought that book 3 was the best so far. This book is the story of Nicole, more than anyone else, trying to find her place in the world. It is filled with faith, daring, adventure and love. She comes to realize that she must hold firm to her convictions of right and wrong in order to live a happy and successful life. Gordon comes to realize what it is Nicole requires in order to admit her love for him.Throughout it all, the relationship between family members is strengthened and enriched by the love they share for one another. I am looking forward to book 5 this fall."
1,Great fun - if it lasted!,"One of the boats takes on water at a rapid rate which negatively impacts its use. The second is fast and fun, although it moves with a left lean. The control is pretty simple and therefore kids quickly learned how to move boats. The floating flags add some element of excitement but the finish line flag is too heavy to keep itself upright and comes with instructions to attach some string to the (provided) suction cups to keep it up. In all, pretty disappointed."
1,Its an OK toy...but dont get them wet!!,"One worked for the first day. The other I dried out and it seemed to work OK after that. However, now the other one that worked the first day does not work at all. These are not durable at all."
2,"Great, for one time use!","These boats were fantastic the first time we used them. They never worked again. Once they were submerged the battery compartment took on water and both boats stopped working. While fun for the hour we played with them, they were a complete waste of money and a disappointment to my two boys who were so excited to race."
2,Cheap Quality Brush,"I have to say that this brush, which I bought for close to $4, is terrible! First of all, the sponge part on the tip started breaking off after less than a week of use, and now I have to clean bits of sponge after every use!I purchased another brush for 1 dollar (from a 99 cents store) and it's 10 times better than this one!"
5,Great gift!,"My sister in law bought me a few things that she found helpful when she had her daughter and this was one of them. So far I have used it everyday for 14 weeks of my baby's life and it has held up great. I have had no problems with it.What's great about it is that it has a flexible brush which I think helps get into a few crevices when I clean the bottles and the little nipple brush is great for scrubbing the formula out of the nipples.I haven't yet put it in the dishwasher, but I use it and rinse it after every use and it has been fine. I would totally recommend this item for any registry or as a gift to a parent of a bottle fed child....it is necessary for good bottle cleaning and it has served me well."
1,Broke after a few months,This bottle brush broke after a few months of use. The brush separated from the handle with the nipple brush.
5,i love it!,i bought for my 7 month old daughter and i have to say ...i didnt belive what a diffrent would make this carseat. we had diffrent ones befor and she always was crying and moving arround as soon you put her in the old one and didnt stop until i took her out:( in the new one she dont wont to go in there either but as soon she is in thre she is quite and plays with her toys until she is asleep.i love it!!!
5,Great seat,"I have several friends who have this seat and have been very pleased. I am as well. It is easy to install and my son appears to be very comfortable. Well, at least the screaming has stopped when we put him in the car =)I don't know that I would put a newborn in it though. We started using it around 3 months (12 1/2 pounds and 25 1/2"") and would have liked to be able to tighten the shoulder straps just a bit more.Would buy again for a 2nd child."
5,Great carseat- easy to install and use!,"We bought this carseat after our Graco wouldn't fit securely in our 2008 Honda CRV. This one went in much easier and is very sturdy. Also, the straps are easy to adjust and baby seems very comfortable. I also really like the velcro hold backs for the straps. Makes it easy to load/unload the baby."
5,Peace of mind....,"We purchased the Britax Marathon for my daugher 1 1/2 years ago and we have been very pleased. Recently, we purchased another one for my son. I love having peace of mind that my children are safe."
4,Britax Marathon,"We have had this car seat for about a month now and we do like it. The only complaint I have is that the straps do twist every now and then if you do not velcrow them out of the way when putting child in and out of the seat. It was easy to install, I did on my own without my husband it does not budge!! It is very comfy and my child has no problem being in it and falls asleep just as easy as he did in his infant car seat."
4,Britax Marathon Car Seat,"This car seat is really great for both safety and comfort. I feel that my child is very well protected and she definitely enjoys the cushy seat. Seat was very easy to install as long as you have LATCH in your car. The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because the owner's manual was a little hard to interpret. I would assume that any person who had never used the LATCH system would have a lot of trouble trying to figure out how to install the seat just by looking through the owner's manual (luckily Britax uses the exact same mechanism that my infant seat did). This is kind of a major flaw since there are such a huge percentage of car seats that are not installed correctly.So, take advantage of the free services the Fire/Police dept.'s offer and just get the seat checked out before use because this is otherwise an outstanding product."
5,One of the best courses for French !,"Definitely one of the best monolingual courses for French student's from High School to College and University. Clear, efficient, communicative"
2,Needs Some Work,"I just purchased this book, ""The Everything Spanish Verb Book"" for my Kindle, along with ""Practice Makes Perfect Spanish Verb Tenses"". Whereas the second book has a searchable table of contents, allowing me to go directly to the subject I am interested in, ""The Everything Spanish Verb Book"" has NO table of contents, which means that no matter how good the contents are, the only option for a reader on a Kindle is to go through the book page by page, with no idea what is coming next and no way to look anything up. This is fine for a novel but not for a textbook.While it may be a very good book in print, this will not be easy to use on a Kindle.A suggestion to Amazon would be to indicate on their Kindle books whether a book is searchable or not because text and educational books need them."
4,Worthwhile,"For anybody who has to conjugate a bunch of verbs for their Spanish class, this is a must! It is also great as a quick reference when writing papers, if you want to be certain you got it right."
2,Any 5 year old monkey could have written this book...,"This is a picture book and price guide on everyone's favorite video games/game systems. The pictures are nice, but the set up is very amateur-ish. What little wording there is throughout could have been written by any 2nd grader. The author seemed to do very little research on the systems. No years, or why games were rare, or any history whatsoever. Just a collection of pictures that the author found. Definitely not worth $.... I'd give someone $...at a garage sale though."
5,Lovin' It,I got this book from the library and loved it so much I bought my own copy. I keep finding interesting recipes to try. My copy is flagged with more than a dozen favorite pages. It's looking like a porcupine. The ingredients are basic and easy to find in any modern market. The recipes are easy to follow and very tasty when done. I'm glad I found this one!
3,Not for everyday cooks,"If you are a professional cook you will find the book interesting. Not for family cooks, to complicated."
5,A comprehensive look at computer security,"Information Security is a must have for anyone involved with computer security. I realized that I've been securing computer systems by focusing on the 3-As (authentication, authorization and audit). This book describes 10 attributes of information security that have to be addressed. It has opened my eyes to areas of security that I had overlooked."
2,Creedence Clearwater Revisited,"This is a live CD made up of former band members of Creedence Clearwater Revival. While the skill of the musicians has still held up after all of these years, John Fogerty was sorely missed. Creedence without John Fogerty is like ketchup without tomatoes. The vocalist who was hired to replace him sounded like a lounge singer vainly attempting to impersonate Fogerty. I went out and bought a ""real"" Creedence CD to replace it."
5,Like boarding a time machine,"Listening to this CD takes me back in time. Sure, I can also listen to the originals, but that might as well be an FM radio station. These guys play the tunes in the right key, with immense enthusiasm and real heart. They now know what this music means to their listeners - in 1970 bands really didn't much of a crap about listeners - and they bring it! The guitar solos start as before, but then the envelope is stretched.Having seen CC Revisited in a live concert, AND the original CCR back in the day, I was transported back in time. Every song was a memory, even note caused a smile. Listen and enjoy. No, it's not the true original four people, but that's not possible as one died in 1990. One other has an incredibly inflated ego. The rest of the original group - who got together in Junior High in 1958, for goodness sake! - is here! And they do their very best to give you the best possible revisit with CCR. Do it!"
1,A long way from the original CCR,"They try, but the lead vocalist just doesn't measure up to Fogerty. He doesn't even come close. I've seen this band live in concert and it is even worse. The album is just a very poor imitation. I've heard better in bars."
2,"Not The Original Band, Doesn't Even Sound 'Live'","The recording sounds better than 'The Best of CCR' but it's not Creedence Clearwater Revival performing. With a different and only competent lead singer, a different band and only a couple of CCR's original members, the 'Revisited' in the album's title is just misleading clever marketing. The original unique sound of CCR is gone. While the recording sounds much better than on the album 'The Best of CCR', the audience cheering, whistling and clapping sounds incredibly canned, fake and forced, like a track that was laid over (or under) the music. When you consider that this group is just parroting the original sound of CCR, that seems kind of appropriate."
4,Great song,"I had never heard of this artist before until I heard her song,Leavin' on one of those tapes that plays in the back ground at storeswhen you shop. I thought it was great! It is about a woman finally having enough of being taking for granted bye the man she loves and she tells him she's Leavin'. I don't think you can get this song anywhere else."
2,"The Music Is Great, But The Package Was Tampered With And Case Shattered","I ordered two CDs, Sunyata and Psymeditation. When I got the package (the standard cardboard CD holder), there was only ONE compact disc.In fact, you could tell that the package had been ripped open, one removed (the other was rattling around inside), and the package resealed with clear packing tape.The remaining CD'd jewel case was shattered and I was fortunate that the CD itself came unscratched.Amazon first ignored half of my email and said they'd send me a replacement Jewel Case. When I replied ""What about the rest of my problem, as in the missing CD?"" they said there was ""A problem with the shipping"" or something and I would get the other CD in a later shipment.I got the 2nd CD, but never the replacement jewel case. I went and bought one myself. Was barely worth ordering online in this case what I could have probably picked up at the same store that I purchased the replacement jewel case."
3,"It works, more or less","The description says it plays WAV format. Don't believe it. It only supports MP3 and WMA.Also, because of its physical design, you can't plug it in to the wall charger and play it at the same time.The menu system is wacky. It works, but it is not intuitive and you have to fidget with it a lot to make it work.On the up side, it does actually play music and the sound quality is good.In summary: it is cheap, and you are basically getting what you pay for."
2,Don't judge a book by its title....,"I was led to believe that this book was about Alzheimer's Disease. I was extremely disappointed by the book, and wish I had not wasted my money. I found only 2 chapters that really had any significance as far as reading about the disease. Instead I read about the author's problems with faith as he progressed through the disease. Also, I could have cared less about his ""exalted"" past and what a great guy he had been until he became ill.I am sure the author had honest intentions. However, this is a book extolling his faith, which may be helpful for those who need a spiritual boost. If you are trying to learn about AD, search elsewhere."
2,I thought this was about Alzheimer's.......,"I bought this book because I thought it would be a personal account of the signs and symptoms of early stage Alzheimer's. I read another called Living in the Labyrinth and found it fascinating, and I highly recommend that book to anyone interested in or having a personal experience with this horrible disease. Robert Davis' book, on the other hand, was more like a 140 page sermon full of praise for the Lord that bestowed this disease on him, bible quotations, and not much else. Let me say here that I am a nurse who has worked with these special patients for more than 10 years, and I was looking for more insight into the mind of someone who could still put their thoughts on paper. Guess I just like the cold, hard facts without all the fluff."
5,a great book,I throughly enjoyed this book...I work in a nursing home in an Alzheimer's unit...I also have an aunt that has just been diagnosed with this teriable disease...This book has really hepled me understand this disease......I have been working around alzheimer's patients for almost 15yrs and this book has realy hepled me understand some of the things are going through and some of the reasons they do the things they do...i suggest that if you have a friend or loved one that has this disease please read this book it will make you look at things in a whole new way..I know it has me and like I said I have been around this disease for almost 15yrs...
4,Lovely scent.,"I love the combination of lime and bergamot,so was very pleased with these candles. They are a tad expensive,but that's usually the case with essential oils. I can't tolerate overpowering fake scents,so it's a nice treat for me. It burns evenly and clean."
3,Not what I expected...,"I thought these bowls would go great in my kitchen. When they arrived, however, I was shocked to see that they were oval (for some reason I expected round) and a bit cheaper looking than they appeared online. They're nice bowls, but buy them knowing that they are oval--I couldn't get over that and decided to send them back."
4,Mouth Watering,"Length:: 0:40 MinsIf you love to cook or grill, this video helps us create tasty, mouth watering meals. The tips are very helpful. Loved it, but make sure you don't watch it on an empty stomach."
2,Not a good intro to Keeler,"Keeler has one of those reputations in mystery-reading circles (at least those who enjoy golden-age mysteries) that I think puts him in a higher regarded class than this book would warrant. He wrote lots of books, and maybe it was unfortunate that I picked this one to read as an introduction to him. It doesn't make me anxious to read more of his books.I found this one way too long (even at only 157 pages) with lots of rambling paragraphs and dialogue that was pretty unrealistic. His prose is too purple for my taste, and I lost patience with his plot dragging and only managed to finish it by skimming and skipping. Even though it contains a ""locked-room"" the policeman explains how someone could have left the scene of the crime and made it seem sealed early on in the book. The puzzle doesn't really give you the satisfying feeling a well-thought-out whodunit should.Not recommended."
4,Hi Ho Silver. . . the Black Mask Rides Again,"These action packed adventures bring back the days of yore to this old man. This might not be Shakespere, but guess which one I'm reading . . . that's right, easy, action packed, white knight-good guy mysteries and crime. . . I love 'em. Erle Stanley Gardner is my cult favorite."
2,sheer disppointment.,"Recently, I purchased the Ironman weighted jump rope. when I finally received the rope it well packaged. Next I opened it with great expectations. only to discover the rope was short, yes short. I am 6ft 2 in, the weight was inadequate. I was totally disappointed, to say the least. I have been skipping for about 6 years. the moment I began to skip, it was impossible to complete my work out. I had other ropes before and my experiences were a lot more satisfying . I have wasted my money on this product. The hard part is even if I returned it I have to loose money in the process. What a waste of time and money for me. Now I am stuck with a product I cannot used and I certainly have to purchase another jump rope."
2,Not the best quality,"The handle part that screws off is plastic, and hard to screw on/off. I haven't really used it and the part that connects the rope to the handle seems to be loose. This isn't the best quality jump rope -- I had expected better for the Ironman brand."
4,Ironman Weighted Jump Rope,Arrived on time and in good condition. Have not used yet. Part of cardiovascular circuit training program. Not using yet.
2,Not very resourceful,It gives you good ideas on what to do to\with your garage but does not tell you the supplier\s of the products featured on the photos. Nice as an idea book.
1,tommy land,"I bought this book because I really enjoyed reading Nikki's book and The Dirt. I couldn't make it past the 2nd chapter of this book. In my own opinion this book is very boring. I'm not sure why either, because Tommy is such an interesting and funny guy in general."
1,A let down,I'm a huge fan of Motley Crue and have read both Dirt and The Heroin Diaries and LOVED them. This on the other hand...not so much. I was really disappointed to be honest. The book was boring and completely random and just plain shallow. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1,trees yeah!,"the only thing i loved about this book was the fact that tommy loves trees all kinds ,shows he still feels things that matter, as do i, either than that it was all about how his brain has migrated to his nether region ,that would be it i would say!!!"
4,"WOW DUDE, ENTERTAINING MAN- :) wink","Well I could hardly put it down, I really wished it was twice as thick as it is so I could read more. Tommy shared quite a bit of his self with the readers in this book- If you want to read another wonderful book, read ""the dirt"" (motley crue) NOW THAT WAS AWESOME!! thanks for the smokin pictures Tommy....WOW!"
4,tommy land,"the book arrived on time, great condition..no complaints with the seller..great customer service..the book is entertaining, honest, and sometimes painful.."
3,"Save the Theology-Lite, where's the beef?","Nice summer read. Glosses over a lot of things, like his heroin abuse. Also, on the first page he says he'll share his preferred method for preparing steaks, and then never comes back to it (unless I missed something).Was a little disappointed that he went in for the Kahlil Gibrahnesque ""religion for simpletons"" books while in prison and embraced a ""life coach"". Whatever gets you through the night, I guess.Overall, a great beach book. Nothing more, nothing less."
1,Don't expect The Dirt,"I purchased this book based on the amazing Motley Crue rock bioThe Dirt (The Anniversary Edition): Confessions of the World's Most Notorious Rock Band.Unfortunately this is not a patch on that effort.Tommy Lee has always come across as the loveable doofus of Motley Crue.Yes he is a complete dude, but don't waste your time with this effort.Everything you need to know can be found in The Dirt - a far better read."
2,"Big Fan, Bad Book","I love books like this and had just read duffs book and was excited to read Tommy's.I read it in a few short hours and wish I could get the time back and read a better Crüe book or biography. The narrative was not cohesive and it just jumped all around without flowing.Mad respect to Tommy, one of the greatest drummers and musicians period, but your co-author should have done a better job with your unique story."
3,This IS Tommy Lee,The book was okay--as someone else has said selective truths. Seemed like a sex guide for me written by a porn star (I guess it kind of is)
2,zzzzzzzzzzzz,"I am a big Motley Crue and Tommy Lee fan and I love to read. Unfortunately I only made it through the first few chapters---just not my thing, I guess!!! There is a few nice color pics which is why I am giving this book 2 stars."
3,Better than I expected,"Having just read Vince Neil's latest autobio, ""Tattoos and Tequila,"" I was intrigued enough to look into Tommy's side. I never cared anything for Motley Crue. In fact, I'm a musician, a drummer, and I find the Crue's stuff pretty lame. Nevetheless, reading these memoirs is fascinating for the rock 'n roll perspective they bring. Which one of the band was the dumbest? Hard to say. Tommy and Vince run pretty evenly in that regard. You will read all about Tommy's mistakes. Pamela etc etc and the little kid who drowned in his pool, as well as Tommy's stint in jail. He sounds genuinely contrite about his mistakes. If you are or were a fan of these guys, then you will be into their books. For the casual music fan, they make nice light reading, good for bathroom breaks."
4,"Tommyland, a funny book.","It is not a classic of the American Literature, but it will make you laugh and who does not need to laugh sometimes?Tommy tell us about his life in a very funny way and the highlights in is this book is, definately, charpter two with his sexual advises.This book worths for the funny moments it gives to us."
4,Enjoy the ride,"Out of all the Motley Crue books (the dirt, heroin diares etc) This on was kinda a let down compared to the other's, don't get me wrong it's still a good book, but I know a few people that skipped a few of the chapters cuase they were kinda boring, I of course read all of them, but through some I was nodding off a bit............Oh I gotta say most of you will probably love the first chapter, he has a conversation with his pen15 lol its pretty funny, his Pen15 also chimes in thoughout the book and puts in its 2 cents worth.."
2,NOT GOOD,"This book was foul and he only touched briefly on things, he didn't go into depth on anything. It was not interesting or funny as it was trying to be."
1,I expected a lot more...,"This is just a waste of book... If Vince's book is horrendous, this is reaaly close to that one; Tommy just wrote a book about how much he still loves Pamela and how great was his love affair with her, and how much hurt he was when she cheated on him and etc etc; basically all about her... He spent eight (8) years of his life with Heather, but he treats the matter as shallow as he could; not even a couple of details or anecdotes about those years that I think were a great part of his life in that era; and the dude is so self centered that he even begins the book talking to his own dick.. WTF?... sometimes this guys just take advantage of the fans by writing these type of books creating anticipation, and the ending result being such a waste of time and money... If you read ""The Dirt"", skip this one..."
4,Tommyland: worth stopping by,"I read this book in about 2.5 hours. Clearly something of a page-turner. Despite the presence of a ghostwriter, the prose is noticeably simplistic. Here, Tommy Lee includes plenty of interesting stories about his rock 'n roll lifestyle, in addition to more serious topics such as his time in jail, sundered relationships, the drowning incident in his pool and the death of his father. He adds in a few chapters of advice to readers - one of which centers on Jagermeister. Lee includes uncensored quotes and excerpts from people who are or once were involved his crazy life - and not all of them have flattering things to say about the drummer-turned-author.Tommyland will prove itself especially interesting for Motley Crue and heavy metal fans; a mildly pleasant read for anyone else."
2,"Funny, but lacks substance...","By the time I had gotten around to reading Tommy Lee's autobiograpy, I'd already read The Dirt & both of Nikki Sixx's books... I was really excited to get started and I found a lot of Tommy's one of a kind humor that made me roll around in the floor, but all in all I did not learn anything from Tommy's book. I found some pages hilarious, but found many more vague and uninteresting."
5,Totally pleased,The book I ordered was just as described and was received in a timely fashion. I would readily buy from this seller again.
2,Not as advertized,"This bible was stated as leather bound, but it is only a basic hardcover. The covers edges are more chewed up than I would like to have seen. Overall, disappointed."
2,BioOrb Compost Container less than expected,"I bought this container because it is rather large and supposedly mobile. This would suite my needs well as I have a two teird backyard with three large vegetable planters up top and a spice garden and several ornamental plants below. I does hold alot, but other than that, it is horrible. To begin, the lid is flimsy so it cannot be rolled all the way over - the lid pops right off. If the Orb is in the sun, the plastic softens and lid is useless all togther. Second, when the container is over 1/2 full, it is extremely hard to move it since you cannot roll it onto the lid (which makes mixing it completely impossible) and the ridges add too much resistance. Third, it stinks and it attracts flies. I had to keep it in the far corners of my backyard, which meant more Orb moving. This fall I will return to my old standard, fixed unit and use a wheelbarrow. I suggest you aviod purchasing this."
4,Great product,"I have worked with this product for about a year now. Its deceptively rugged when assembled. It definitely beats having a pile of junk in the back yard. There is a trick to using it though. The lid can be a bit touchy. You just have to make sure the two large tabs are inside the rim of the opening and then push until you hear the dimples pop and lock into place (You'll understand the description once you see one). A second tip is to not overload it. Think of it this way, If you wouldn't want to lift it in a wheel barrow you probably wouldn't want to roll it around the yard. I find that about half full is all I want to try rolling.+Speeds up the composting process a LOT+Easy to Assemble+Durable-Bit of a tricky lidOnce I mastered the lid I was a happy camper, I definitely recommend this product!"
3,Gag Gift,"Works as well as can be expected from plastic gun.I remember the ones of my youth being better made, but these are hard to find now a days."
4,Great toy for the price.,"My son and his friends love it. There's no noise or bullets to buy or pick up (as long as they shoot outside). It jams fairly often, but for the price, and simplicity of the design, that's to be expected."
4,Does the job of filling a DIN slot.,"Handy deep pocket to fill a DIN slot when upgrading the radio in my car. Could not use the front trim though. Still works well, and looks pretty good."
3,Not a good description!,Bought this to replace my old cassette holder in my W201 and unfortunately the description was perfect for the measurements of the hole. Didn't fit at all. Disappointed with the poor description by who ever it was done.
5,GREAT FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT,"Another winner with WALTON'S SEASON 5! I own all 5 seasons and am never disappointed with the lives of the Walton family! How wonderful to have some ""good, clean"" family shows to offer my children. The Waltons are a family with good morals, real life trials during the depression era in the late 1930's. A family who have respect for other family members and those in their community too. Also, is the opportunity to learn a little history of our country during the 30's and 40's. I'd recommend the WALTONS to anyone, anytime! I'm looking forward to the remaining seasons being released!"
2,I was a bit disappointed,"I love the Waltons, but was disappointed when this season came because it contained two no. four discs but no no. one disc. As a result, I missed six episodes of this season. And after reading the return policy realized that I would just have to miss them as I couldn't return it since it had been opened... and I couldn't have found out that the disc's were messed up until I did open it. Otherwise, I enjoyed the other episodes as I expected I would since I grew up watching the Waltons and was looking forward to seeing them again."
5,well worth the price,"as for the whole series a great treat to watch, to bad they don't make shows like it anymore"
4,love the show...but,one of the best dramas ever...however this is the second time i received a defective dvd...one of the discs just freezes up and won't play...i sure hope these problems go away in the future
5,The Waltons the complete series especially Season 5,The stories are so interesting and true to the era of time. It helps me tovisualize the feelings of my parents and grandparents during that timeperiod. The kids' acting has improved tremendously. I appreciate the factthat I can watch something wholesome as well as interesting.
1,"The ""Titanic"" of ""The Waltons"": Season Five","Scriptwriters and producers sent ""The Waltons"" on an irrevocable slow sink (and stink) to the bottom of the TV sea beginning in Season Five. What breached the show's hull in 1976-77? Incredibly poor story ideas and unbelievably lousy character treatment/development. In Season Five, the navigating efforts of the writers/producers seemed more hopeful than certain. In Season Five, creative conviction disappeared. If the show's best actor, Richard Thomas, sensed this downslide, it is little wonder he jumped ship and swam towards more challenging projects."
3,Bad Disc,"I recently purchased seasons four and five of The Waltons for my bed ridden Mother. She has few pleasures left, but has always enjoyed The Waltons. I had already purchased the first three seasons and all discs worked fine. Side B of disc one for season five only plays the first episode. No matter what I do, I cannot get the remainder of the disc to play. I cannot return it, so I am stuck with a disc that will not play. Even if I had returned it, chances are that the same problem would occur with the replacement. From reading other reviews, I see that this is a reoccurring problem. If it happens again, I will not be ordering any more DVDs from Amazon."
4,Good family viewing for the teenage years,"We have enjoyed the Walton series as our children enter the teen years. Close family ties and loyalty are major themes. Topics for discussion are the Baldwin sisters' ""recipe"" and the father's lack of religion."
3,Disk 2 & 3 were Incomplete on my set,"I love the Waltons, so I have no complaints whatsoever about the shows, etc. But, Disk 2 & 3 had technical problems that caused the disks to not running properly. On the last show on both disk 2 & 3, the show would start over midstream and not allow me to progress any further. So, please check your DVDs (disk 2 & 3 especially) to make sure that they are running properly while you are still able to send them back for exchange, as I did. I have not received the new set as yet to see if this is a constant problem. I see where someone else had the same issues in an earlier review. So, please remember to check your DVDs 2 & 3 right away."
5,Very Good Card,"I got this card today and it works pretty well. It managed to connect to my router. After setting up proxies for the pda i was able to use the internet. Its no pc internet, but u can use the basics. I have a hp ipaq 2215 and the card didnt slow it down. for the price i would greatly recomend this product."
5,Works great for Axim X5 thus far,"I ""aquired"" a dell axim x5 about a month ago and after a week of Wireless CF card research I found that the ambicom 54g was about the only left on the market that is still ""in stock"". So far it's working great. I get signal just like a laptop and it installed without a glitch. It will suck power if you don't change your pda's power setting to either Auto or Power Save. Overall, it's so cool to check facebook and hotmail from a PDA at free wi-fi spots without having to pay cell phone service."
1,No Good in Zaurus SL-5500,I thought that it would work fine with my Zaurus SL-5500. It turns out that the Linux drivers only work with kernel 2.6. OpenZaurus and the Sharp Rom use kernel 2.4. This card does not work for me.
3,Can't offer quality feedback,I purchased this card in hopes that it would work in my Dell Axim X5. The device has PPC Version 2002. The card needs Windows Mobile 2003 or later apparently. Know anybody that would like it?
1,AMBICOM 54-CF,"very poor quality drivers, tech support almost zero (unless one speaks taiwanese dialect), I whish I could send it back (lost the original packing)...What a waste of money !"
1,Terrible Jerks,"They delivered my old version of CF(Orange One).I called Customer service, do you know what they said?""We are temporarily out of stock, so we sent you upgrade one(better one)""Do they think we are ***.As you know Orange one says 135X and blue one one says 80X.But blue one(brand new one) is faster and more expensive.I compared two CF with my RebelXT, there was slight difference in writing speed in Full Burst with Raw.I hate this oneline transaction."
5,VonRa - The Next Superstars!!!,"This cd is absolutely phenomenal!!! In fact it is one of the best cd's I've heard in years. Every song is killer. This band has it all - the singer has an incredible voice, every song is extremely catchy, the musicianship is excellent and the lyrics are awsome. If you like bands like Live, Matchbox 20, Counting Crows, Pearl Jam or Dave Matthews Band don't even hestitate to buy this cd!! I can assure you that you will be a huge fan after the first listen. I have listened to this cd for months now and it grows on me every time I hear it. I know it's only a matter of time before VonRa becomes one of the biggest band in the states. This cd has become one of my all time favorites - buy it now and discover this amazing band!!"
5,Hansons new single rocks!,"This single is the greatest one! First, because it has Hansons new big hit, If Only. Second, because it also has an AMAZING exclusive track, SMILE...one of the songs that should definetely have been included in the album (which is their best one)!"
2,Jakarta Struts for Dummies,"I did not think this book was very good. The first twochapter start out with the introduction and overalldescription of Struts and do a good job, but the thirdand largest chapter discusses creating a applicationusing Eclipse. This is by far themost important chapter but the user gets lost in Eclipse.There should be another way to present the information. Alsowhy use Eclipse? It would be better to use notepad, TextPador some other simple editor so the user gets the feelingof everything that must be done to use Struts. A bettereditor would be NetBeans if you can not use Notepad orTextPad. Hence the third chapter and the most importantone is a loss. The fourth, fifth and sixth chapter talk aboutStruts MVC (Model, View, Controller) structure. AnywayI was hopping for a better book. One that I could learnStruts from easily. If you want to learn Eclipse and Strutsthen this is the book for you. If you want to learn Strutsquickly and easily look someplace else."
2,Was disappointed in this book,"I was disappointed with this book. I found other resources on Struts to be much better written, more helpful, and clear on the subject. (For example, I recommend ""Struts Survival Guide"") as a great tutorial on Struts.I would not recommend this book. As one who frequently buys books on programming, this one fell flat."
3,"Good, but in need of an update.","This book is an excellent introduction into the Jakarta Struts technology, BUT you need to be aware that it is dated. It covers the basics of the technology well and tries to get you into the first coding examples quickly and that is where you run into problems.The book is written against versions of Struts and Eclipse that are quite old now (Struts 1.1 and Eclipse 2.1). The Eclipse environment has changed significantly and many of the Struts tag libraries described in the book have changed (they have been renamed, moved or incorporated into other libraries). This means that you cannot get the examples in the book to run without a significant amount of changes.It is a shame because the book is well written and clear but unless the author does a major update or you are willing to hunt for, and use old versions of the software you might be better off finding something more up-to-date."
3,"First starting, then it gets cold","In the starting the author builds a simple example from the ground up. But, from chapter four, instead of continuing adding features to the example, start to explain things whitout practical examples. Conclusion: you are disconnected from the real work with struts until the rest of the book, when he builds a complete application in only one chapter."
4,winner for beginners,"I read this book way back and it's a winner for beginners! Except the name of the book (dummies?!?!) this book is an excellent start for the struts audience (again, beginners only!). Let me put it this way, if you have 0 knowledge about struts, take this book, read it and *implement* the examples - you'll understand everything, guarantee!Robinson and Finkelstein did an excellent job explaining the intricacies of the struts framework and implementation. Well done guys!Simple, elegant, (sometimes funny), bottom line and excellent examples!4 stars!"
4,Good basic Java book,I know Dummies books get a bad rap from the hard core programmer community. I found this book was fairly detailed and easy to use. For a quick reference not bad at all.
2,Didn't work with my computer...,I bought this product with the hopes of it speeding up my computer but it didn't work. I had to return it.
1,"Incompatible, no support","I purchased this device to add to my wireless network, which uses a Belkin wireless router. I had to connect the router directly to the game adapter since it could not be detected by my wireless router. After configuring it, I could never find it once it was disconnected from the ethernet cable from my wireless router. I made three attempts at customer service - my first call was disconnected after 20 minutes, the second call was working with a woman in India, who's headset had a ton of static to add to her accent. I had to end that session because we couldn't hear each other. I then used online chat, and after 90 minutes I still had not solved my problem, and that session was disconnected for unknown reasons. The lady from India did mention that mixing their product with any other wireless router would be a problem, and now I believe her."
1,Garbage,"I keep telling myself 'no more Linksys' and this product might have finally convinced me to live up to my word. What a piece of cr*p. Worked for 3 days (just fine) when I first connected it and then just stopped. Wireless light (which is supposed to indicate connectivity) just blinked slowly and steadily - no transmission.Spent 90 minutes with a tech support rep in a chat session - who was very nice and tried but refused to consider an exchange until we finished 'diagnosing' the problem. Problem was, after an hour and a half of my evening - with absolutely zero progress - the rep simply vanished. The chat didn't end - he just stopped replying.Sorry Linksys - I'm done."
4,"If properly configured, an excelent product!","Im using a pair of these as 802.11a(5ghz) bridge between my home and my sons home aross the street(150m). These game adapters are working fantasticly as a bridge, intially between our xboxes, extending and merging our networks. I had no problem getting into the adapter using 192.168.1.250, setting my NIC to 192.168.1.1. I reset the IP addresses to 192.168.3.249 & 250. to work on my existing net. I have run into slow & locked up transmission but since my son now turns his unit/adapter on/off with his computer and xbox powerstrip we've had few if any more problems. I did call customer support and got some who new nothing."
3,it worked but then it just stoped,ive gotten two of them so far on the past 2 years its really hard to get them to work once u chnage any setting on your router i had to return it thank god the store took it back even though i didnt have a receip.
4,Icicle Thief,"A fun film. Starts off slow, builds to the point that you are glued to the screen. Starling original, fascinating, juxtapositon of reality and make believe (film/tv). Makes you wonder if there is all that much difference between life and creative art. Was a bit confusing when film first jumps between the various worlds. Loved the fate of the director."
2,Not quite Amazon Women on the Moon,"Maybe it is a language or cultural discrepancy, but this movie just did not make me laugh. It is a typical movie where people are watching a movie review on TV and some of the characters on the TV show and the movie being reviewed trade places. This annoys the director of the movie (who is being interviewed on the TV show) who then tries to get the characters back in their correct places. Ho hum..."
5,The most comprehensive instructional video for any player,"Table Tennis The Sport won first prize at for the NASPE Video of the Year. This video includes footage of World Championships, Super Slow motion instruction, animated illustrations to help you understand spin, and trick shots for your enjoyment. Recommended for any level player from beginner to Olympian."
4,a well written historical and psychological thriller,"Bruce Ducker taps into a modern sleuth story with important historical ramifications (the question of Jewish assets ""lost"" during WWII) to write a compelling work of fiction. The book is more than just a detective story about hidden asssets. Ducker develops an interesting and complex protagonist whose amateur detective work leads him to learn more about his own family history. Although the plot itself is somewhat obvious, the characters are first rate, as are the scenes from Zurich and Budapest."
4,A gripping combonation,Bloodlines provides a gripping combination of the intricacies of banking and the elements of a thriller.
1,no customer service,"I bought a 32c in November, the warranty stated in home service for 32 in and larger. Well the thing quit working July 12th and customer service for Protron said they would not service it but would replace it with a new unit if I sent it back to them. I did at a cost of $169.00 UPS. They received it on July 21st. I called them on the 24th for the status on my replacement and was informed that they had no replacement units as they were on backorder and would be sent asap(maybe 6 weeks or longer) I called again today ""They were very rude"" would give me no information except asap. Told me to call back next week."
1,Expected much more,"I expected much more from a book with ""Audubon Birds"" in the title. The designs are simple and the poses of the birds seem unnatural. I would not recommended this book to an experienced cross-stitcher. It might perhaps be of use to a novice cross-stitcher."
1,"Save your money, and avoid buying this book!","Ok, so I figured that a book called ""Secrets of Halo 2"" might be cool, and show me some secrets that I haven't found yet (there are a lot out there). Instead what I got was this piece of ....First off, out of the whole book, only about 6 pages are actually about Halo 2, and those are just a walkthrough of campaign. The rest of the book contains a history of first person shooters, and, get this, hints and cheats for OTHER games. If I wanted to know about Half Life 2, I would have bought a book on Half Life 2. Oh, and for those really old school fans, there's a quick walkthrough of Halo as well.Even if I knew what this book was going to be, I would say avoid it. It has more crappy screenshots, and over used strategies (example: Remember that you can duel wield in Halo 2), then you can shake a stick at.Avoid buying this book. Save your money for Halo 3."
2,what you dont know,"this is basically a walkthrough but they dont tell you that i was dissapointed when i finally get it, but thats just me its up tu you"
